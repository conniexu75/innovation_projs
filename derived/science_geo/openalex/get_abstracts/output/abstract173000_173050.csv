https://openalex.org/W2042216771,"Massive stars (with mass m_* > 8 solar masses) are fundamental to the evolution of galaxies, because they produce heavy elements, inject energy into the interstellar medium, and possibly regulate the star formation rate. The individual star formation time, t_*f, determines the accretion rate of the star; the value of the former quantity is currently uncertain by many orders of magnitude, leading to other astrophysical questions. For example, the variation of t_*f with stellar mass dictates whether massive stars can form simultaneously with low-mass stars in clusters. Here we show that t_*f is determined by conditions in the star's natal cloud, and is typically ~10^5 yr. The corresponding mass accretion rate depends on the pressure within the cloud - which we relate to the gas surface density - and on both the instantaneous and final stellar masses. Characteristic accretion rates are sufficient to overcome radiation pressure from ~100 solar mass protostars, while simultaneously driving intense bipolar gas outflows. The weak dependence of t_*f on the final mass of the star allows high- and low-mass star formation to occur nearly simultaneously in clusters."

In the present study, we isolated a cDNA from the human and rat kidney that encodes a growth-related Na+-dependent inorganic phosphate (Pi) cotransporter (type IIc). Microinjection of type IIc cRNA into Xenopus oocytes demonstrated sodium-dependent Pi cotransport activity. Affinity for Pi was 0.07 mm in 100 mm Na+. The transport activity was dependent on extracellular pH. In electrophysiological studies, type IIc Na/Pi cotransport was electroneutral, whereas type IIa was highly electrogenic. In Northern blotting analysis, the type IIc transcript was only expressed in the kidney and highly in weaning animals. In immunohistochemical analysis, the type IIc protein was shown to be localized at the apical membrane of the proximal tubular cells in superficial and midcortical nephrons of weaning rat kidney. Hybrid depletion experiments suggested that type IIc could function as a Na/Pi cotransporter in weaning animals, but its role is reduced in adults. The finding of the present study suggest that the type IIc is a growth-related renal Na/Pi cotransporter, which has a high affinity for Pi and is electroneutral.

Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is of critical importance to body functions, particularly during periods of growth. The kidneys contribute to the maintenance of the positive Pi balance required for growth by reabsorbing a high fraction of the filtered Pi (1Spitzer A. Barac-Nieto M. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2001; 16: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The capacity for Na+-dependent phosphate cotransport across the luminal brush border membrane of renal proximal tubular cells is higher in juveniles than in adults (2Caverzasio J. Muer H. Fleish H. Bonjour J.P. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1982; 394: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3Neiberger R.E. Barac-Nieto M. Spitzer A. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: F268-F274PubMed Google Scholar). Several mammalian renal Na+-dependent Pi cotransporters have recently been isolated and characterized (4Muer H. Hernando N. Foster I. Biber J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1373-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The cDNAs of these transporters can be divided into three types (types I–III) in the kidney cortex (4Muer H. Hernando N. Foster I. Biber J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1373-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Type II Na/Pi cotransporters belong to a unique class of Na+-coupled cotransport proteins. They can be further subdivided into two subgroups, type IIa and type IIb (4Muer H. Hernando N. Foster I. Biber J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1373-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Type IIa cotransporters are expressed in the proximal tubule of the kidney, whereas type IIb are expressed in several tissues such as the lung and small intestine (4Muer H. Hernando N. Foster I. Biber J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1373-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Functional characteristics, proximal tubular localization of the mRNAs, and apical expression of type IIa Na/Pi cotransporters suggest that this protein represents the most likely pathway of proximal tubular apical Na+-dependent entry of Pi (4Muer H. Hernando N. Foster I. Biber J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1373-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Age dependence was observed at the level of the type IIa Na/Pi cotransporter protein expression (5Sorribas V. Lotscher M. Loffing J. Biber J. Kaislling B. Muer H. Levi M.

Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1023-1026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, a specific type IIa-related Na/Pi cotransporter protein was postulated to account for high Pi transport rates in weaning animals (7Silverstein D.M. Barac-Nieto M. Muer H. Spitzer A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R928-R933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence for this was obtained by antisense experiments and transport expression in Xenopus oocytes (1Spitzer A. Barac-Nieto M. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2001; 16: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,7Silverstein D.M. Barac-Nieto M. Muer H. Spitzer A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R928-R933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When mRNA isolated from the kidney cortex of rapidly growing rats was treated with type IIa transporter antisense oligonucleotides or was depleted of type IIa-specific mRNA by a subtractive hybridization procedure, Na+-dependent Pi uptake was still detected in injected oocytes (1Spitzer A. Barac-Nieto M. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2001; 16: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7Silverstein D.M. Barac-Nieto M. Muer H. Spitzer A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R928-R933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The type IIa transporter-depleted mRNA contained a mRNA species that showed some sequence homology to the type IIa transporter encoding message. This conclusion is compatible with the observation that young type IIa (Npt2) knock-out mice lacking type IIa mRNA and protein retain the capacity to reabsorb Pi at a rate that cannot be explained by the presence of type I and III Na/Pitransporter (8Beck L.

In the present study, we isolated a growth-related type II Na/Pi cotransporter in human and rat kidneys. Male Wister rats (3 weeks after birth) were purchased from Shizuoka Laboratory Animal Center (Shizuoka, Japan). They were housed in plastic cages and fed standard rat chow diet (Oriental, Osaka, Japan) ad libitum for the first week. After that period, they received a diet containing 1.2% calcium and 0.6% phosphorus for 5 days. On the 6th day, the following three groups of six rats each were established: the control Pi group, rats that were chronically fed a diet containing 0.6% Pi; the low Pi group, rats that received a diet containing a low percentage (0.02%) of Pi; and the high Pigroup, in which the rats received a high percentage (1.2%) Pi diet. After 7 days of the given diet, all of the rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital, and their kidneys were removed rapidly. cDNAs for human expressed sequence tags (EST) (GenBankTM/EBI/DDBJ accession no. AI792826), which we found in the course of EST database searches to show nucleotide sequence similarity to human type IIa Na/Picotransporter, were obtained using IMAGE (integrated and molecular analysis of genomes and their expression). The ∼0.8-kb SacI fragment was excised from human cDNA (IMAGE cDNA clone 1535299) and labeled with 32P using the Megaprime DNA labeling system, dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) for use as a probe to screen a human kidney 5′-Stretch Plus cDNA library (CLONTECH). Screening of the cDNA library and isolation of positive plaques were performed as described previously (10Miyamoto K. Tatsumi S. Sonoda T. Yamamoto H. Minami H. Taketani Y. Takeda E. Biochem.

The human type IIc Na/Pi cotransporter fragment (corresponding to nucleotides 89–600 of the nucleotide sequence) was used to isolate a rat cDNA for type IIc Na/Picotransporter. The oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library was prepared from rat kidney poly(A)+ RNA using the Superscript Choice system (Invitrogen) (12Segawa H. Fukasawa Y. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19745-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The synthesized cDNA was ligated to λZIPLOX EcoRI arms (Invitrogen). Screening of the cDNA library and isolation of the positive plaques were performed as described previously (12Segawa H. Fukasawa Y. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol.

Xenopus oocyte expression studies and uptake measurements were performed as described previously (11Tatsumi S. Miyamoto K. Kouda T. Motonaga K. Katai K. Ohkido I. Morita K. Segawa H. Tani Y.

For expression experiments, 25 ng of cRNA was injected into each oocyte. Xenopus oocyte expression was performed as described previously (11Tatsumi S. Miyamoto K. Kouda T. Motonaga K. Katai K.

Groups of six to eight oocytes were incubated in 500 μl of standard uptake solution (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2 10 mmHEPES, and 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4) or Na+-free uptake solution in which NaCl in standard uptake solution was replaced by choline chloride containing 0.1 μCi of radiolabeled compounds (10Miyamoto K.

Electrophysiological measurements were performed at room temperature using oocytes 3 days after cRNA injection. The oocytes were impaled with two 3 mKCl-filled electrodes with resistances of 0.5–2 MΩ. The electrodes were connected to a commercial two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier (CEZ 1250, Nihon Koden, Tokyo Japan) via Ag-AgCl pellet electrodes and referenced to an Ag-AgCl pellet that was connected to the bath via a 3 m KCl-agar bridge. The voltage clamp was controlled by an analog-to-digital-to-analog interface board (Digidata 1200, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) using pCLAMP 6 software (Axon Instruments). The voltage clamp protocol was for 2 s at –80 to +80 mV membrane potential. The external control solution (superfusate) contained (mm): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.4. Phosphate was added to this solution at the indicated concentrations. The final experimental solutions were adjusted to pH 7.4. The flow rate of the superfusate was 20 ml/min, and complete exchange of the bath solution was reached within about 10 s. For hybrid depletion experiments, rat kidney poly(A)+ RNA (5 μg/μl) was denatured at 65 °C for 5 min in solution A (50 mm NaCl and a 20 μm concentration of a 16-mer oligonucleotide complementary to rat type II phosphate transporters) and further incubated at 42 °C for 30 min (13Magagnin S.

The positions of sense oligonucleotide type IIa (5′-GTCCAGGGTAGAGGCC-3′, nucleotides +1004–1019), antisense type IIa (5′-GGCCTCTACCCTGGAC-3′, nucleotides +1004–1019), sense type IIc (5′-ATTGGCCTGGTGGACT-3′, nucleotides +134–149), and antisense type IIc (5′-AGTCCACCAGGCCAA-3′, nucleotides +134–149) are complementary to the rat type IIa and type IIc mRNA sequence (7Silverstein D.M. Barac-Nieto M. Muer H. Spitzer A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R928-R933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sample of poly(A)+ RNA was injected into the oocytes, and uptake measurements were performed as described previously (10Miyamoto K. Tatsumi S. Sonoda T. Yamamoto H. Minami H. Taketani Y.

Brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) 1The abbreviations used are: BBMVsbrush border membrane vesicles. were prepared from rat kidney by the Ca2+ precipitation method as described previously (14Katai K. Segawa H. Haga H. Morita K. Arai H. Tatsumi S. Taketani Y. Miyamoto K. Hisano S. Fukui Y. Takeda E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The levels of leucine aminopeptidase, Na+K+-ATPase, and cytochrome c oxidase were measured to assess the purity of the membranes. Protein samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min in sample buffer in either the presence or absence of 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically on Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were treated with diluted affinity-purified anti-type IIa (1:4000) (14Katai K. Segawa H. Haga H. Morita K. Arai H. Tatsumi S. Taketani Y. Miyamoto K. Hisano S. Fukui Y. Takeda E. J.

The signals were detected using the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences) (15Chairoungdua A. Segawa H. Kim J.Y. Miyamoto K. Haga H. Fukui Y. Mizoguchi K. Ito H. Takeda E. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol.

Immunohistochemical analysis of the rat kidney was performed as described previously with minor modification (15Chairoungdua A. Segawa H. Kim J.Y. Miyamoto K. Haga H. Fukui Y. Mizoguchi K. Ito H.

For immunostaining, serial sections (5 μm) were incubated with affinity-purified anti-type IIa (1:4000) or type IIc (1:1000) Na/Pi cotransporter antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter, they were treated with Envision(+) rabbit peroxidase (Dako) for 30 min. To detect immunoreactivity, the sections were treated with diaminobenzidine (0.8 mm). An oligopeptide (CYENPQVIASQQL) corresponding to amino acid residues 590–601 of rat type IIc Na/Pi cotransporter was synthesized. The C-terminal cysteine residues were introduced for conjugation with keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Rabbit anti-peptide antibodies were produced as described previously (14Katai K. Segawa H. Haga H. Morita K. Arai H. Tatsumi S. Taketani Y. Miyamoto K. Hisano S. Fukui Y. Takeda E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Differences between experimental groups were determined by analysis of variance, and p values of <0.05 were accepted as indicating a significant difference. The human type IIc cDNA was 2020 bp long with an open reading frame of 1797 bp encoding 599 amino acids. Hydropathy analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence revealed the presence of eight putative transmembrane domains. The extracellular segments of human type IIc cotransporter contained four putative N-linked glycosylation sites. Potential intracellular phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C was detected at residues 24, 152, 481, and 581 (Fig. 1a). Amino acids in the membrane-spanning regions were especially well conserved among the three isoforms. Amino acid comparisons revealed that the newly identified protein was 36–38% homologous to Na/Pi cotransporters identified in human type IIa and type IIb amino acid sequences, respectively (16Magagnin S. Werner D. Markovich V. Sorribas V. Stange G. Biber J. Muer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. UAS. 1993; 90: 5979-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 17Field J.A. Zhang L. Burn K.A. Brooks D.P. Edwards R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Overall homology to types I and III Na/Pi cotransporters was ∼10% (10Miyamoto K. Tatsumi S. Sonoda T. Yamamoto H. Minami H. Taketani Y. Takeda E. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18O‘Hara B. Johann S.V. Klinger H.P. Blair D.G. Rubinson H. Dunn K.J. Sass P. Vitek S.M. Robins T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1990; 1: 119-127PubMed Google Scholar). The highest degrees of homology were detected in regions that have been suggested to be the membrane-spanning domains. The most striking difference in the newly identified protein compared with the type II Na/Pi cotransporters was found in the C-terminal region containing clusters of cysteine residues. A similar clustering of cysteine residues was also present in the type IIb Na/Picotransporters of human mouse, and flounder kidney. The expression of type IIc mRNA was analyzed by Northern blotting using human multiple tissue Northern blot and poly(A)+ RNA from rat tissues (Fig. 1, b and c). Using the type IIc cDNA as a probe, a strong 2.4-kb signal was observed only in the kidney. No signals were detected in the brain, heart, skeletal muscle, thymus, spleen, lung, or peripheral blood leukocytes. In addition, the expression of the type IIc mRNA was significantly higher in weaning animals (22 days old) compared with those in adults (60 days old) (Fig. 1d). The levels of type IIc mRNA were lowest in suckling animals. The functional properties of human type IIc Na/Pi cotransporter were examined in Xenopus oocytes. As shown in Fig. 2, the microinjection of Xenopus oocytes with human type IIc Na/Pi cotransporter resulted in a marked increase relative to the level apparent in water-injected oocytes (Fig. 2a). [32P]Phosphate uptake mediated by human type IIc was dependent on Na+ but not Cl−(Fig. 2b), and it increased in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of Na+ (Fig. 2b). The uptake was saturable, and the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) for Piwas 70 μm (Fig. 2c). Type IIc-mediated Na/Pi uptake was stimulated by a more alkaline pH, a hallmark of proximal tubular Na/Pi cotransport (Fig. 2d). The apparent Kd and Hill coefficient for Na interaction was Kd = 48 ± 9 mm and n = 1.73, respectively (Fig. 2e). Fig. 3 shows typical time courses of currents at a membrane potential of –60 mV during the addition of Pi. Superfusion of oocytes expressing the type IIa Na/Pi cotransporter with Pi exhibited currents that depended on the presence of external Na+. Such currents were not observed when the same protocol was applied to water or noninjected oocytes (data not shown). Washout of Pi was also accompanied by a similar biphasic return to the base-line values. Reversal potential shifted from –22 mV to +16 mV during stimulation with 1 mm Pi in type IIa Na/Pi cotransporter-expressing oocytes. These observations suggest that the currents stimulated by 1 mm Piwere Na+ currents. These findings confirmed that the previous observation that the Na/Pi cotransport by the type IIa cotransporter was electrogenic (19Forster I. Hernando N. Biber J. Muer H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast, a superinfusion of oocytes expressing the type IIc cotransporter with Pi(0.1–3 mm) did not exhibit the currents. These observations suggested that, unlike type IIa, Na/Picotransport by the type IIc Na/Pi cotransporter is electroneutral. The molecular weight of type IIc Na/Pi cotransporter protein was determined by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 4a). In BBMVs isolated from the rat kidney (22 days old), the specific antibody reacted with a band of 80–85 kDa under reducing conditions (Fig. 4a). As measured by the presence of antigen peptides in the absorption experiments, the 80–85 kDa band disappeared (Fig. 4a). In addition, FLAG-fused type IIc Na/Pi cotransporter in COS-7 cells was observed as 85- and 160-kDa bands using FLAG-specific monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4b). The type IIc antibodies reacted with the 80–85 kDa protein band (data not shown). In addition, we examined whether the type IIc antibodies react with type IIa Na/Pi cotransporter protein. The type IIc antibodies did not react with any bands in the COS 7 cells expressing the type IIa or type IIb Na/Picotransporters (Fig. 4b). Next, we investigated developmental changes in rat renal type IIc protein levels (Fig. 4c). Western blotting demonstrated that the amount of type IIc protein in the BBMVs was highest in weaning rat, lower in adult rats, and lowest in suckling rats. In Fig. 4e, BBMVs isolated from the kidney of a rat (40 days old) fed a diet low in Pi for 7 days were prepared and used for Western blotting. The amounts of type IIc transporter protein (80–85-kDa band) were significantly increased (by about 5.0-fold for the 80–85-kDa band) compared with those in rats fed the control diet. In contrast, the high Pi diet markedly suppressed the level of type IIc transporter protein. Immunolocalization of type IIc Na/Pi cotransporter protein was performed with the kidneys of weaning rats (22 days old). In Fig. 5,a and b, expression of type IIc cotransporter immunoreactive protein was detected exclusively in the superficial and juxtamedullary nephron. The control antibodies did not stain it (data not shown). The highest expression was observed in convoluted proximal tubules. At higher magnification, it was evident that type IIc antibody-mediated immunoreactivity was localized in the brush border of proximal tubular cells and was completely absent in the basolateral membrane domain (Fig. 5g). Brush-border staining was slightly weaker in superficial nephrons than in juxtamedullary nephrons. In contrast, in weaning rats, type IIa-related immunoreactivity was detected only in juxtamedullary nephrons (Fig. 5,c and d) but not in the superficial and midcortical regions. Type IIa-related immunostaining was observed in a subapical vesicular structure, which likely belongs to the vacuolar endocytic apparatus, in weaning rat kidney (Fig. 5h). In the adult kidney (Fig. 5, e and f), type IIc-related immunoreactivity was detected only in juxtamedullary nephrons and not in the superficial and midcortical regions. Type IIa-related immunostaining was observed in midcortical and juxtamedullary nephrons in adult rats. Evidence for the type IIc Na/Picotransporter was obtained by antisense experiment (Fig. 6). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” when poly (A)+ RNA isolated from the kidney of adult rats was treated with type IIa transporter antisense oligonucleotides of type IIa-specific mRNA, Na+-dependent Pi uptake was completely suppressed in injected oocytes (Fig. 6a). In contrast, when poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the kidney of weaning rats was treated with type IIa antisense oligonucleotides, Pi uptake was still detected in injected oocytes (Fig. 6b). In contrast, type IIc antisense oligonucleotides significantly suppress Pi uptake in oocytes expressing poly(A)+ RNA from weaning rat kidney (Fig. 6d). However, similar treatment did not affect Pi uptake in oocytes expressing poly(A)+ RNA from adult rat kidney (Fig. 6c). Tubular Pi reabsorption decreases during aging as has been indicated by metabolic balance studies, clearance studies, and studies with isolated vesicles (1Spitzer A. Barac-Nieto M. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2001; 16: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 2Caverzasio J. Muer H. Fleish H. Bonjour J.P. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J.

This decrease is due to a reduction in the Vmax without a change in the apparent Km for Pi of the brush border membrane Na/Pi cotransport. Kinetic properties and pH dependence of type IIc-mediated Na/Pi cotransport favor this protein as a candidate for a Na/Pi cotransporter involved in a high Pi transport activity in weaning animals (4Muer H. Hernando N. Foster I. Biber J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1373-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In addition, our characterization of the kinetics of the type IIc transporter gave findings consistent with those reported in the BBMV studies (20Beliveau R. Strevey J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F663-F669PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hoffmann N. Thees M. Kinne R. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1976; 362: 147-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As reported for the renal type IIa Na/Picotransporter, superfusion of oocytes expressing the type IIa Na/Pi cotransporter with Pi exhibited an inwardly directed current that was dependent on the presence of Na+ and the steady-state holding potential (19Forster I. Hernando N. Biber J. Muer H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, type IIc mediated Na/Pi cotransport was electroneutral. The apparent Kd and Hill coefficient for Na+interaction were obtained using the Hill equation (for human type IIc-mediated uptake, Kd = 48 + 9 mm, and n = 1.73). Busch et al. (22Busch A. Waldegger S. Herzer T. Biber J. Markovich D. Hayes G. Murer H. Lang F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8205-8208Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) characterized the electrogenicity by expressing the type IIa Na/Picotransporter (NaPi-2) cloned from rat kidney in Xenopus oocytes. They showed that in the mandatory presence of extracellular Na+, Pi induced an inward current (Ip) for membrane potentials (V) in the range of –80 < V < +10 mV. Consistent with the findings from BBMVs, the magnitude of Ip depended on the substrate concentrations, extracellular pH, and membrane potential. However, in contrast to the 2:1 stoichiometry to Na/Pi at pH 7.4 proposed from BBMV studies (23Cheng L. Sacktor B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1556-1564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hoffman N. Thees M. Kinne R. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1976; 362: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), findings of a Hill slope close to 3 for the Na+ dose response at saturating Pi suggested a 3:1 stoichiometry for type IIa Na/Pi cotransport at –50 mV. In contrast, the present findings suggest that type IIc has the 2:1 stoichiometry to Na/Pi at pH 7.4 as proposed from BBMV studies (23Cheng L. Sacktor B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1556-1564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hoffman N. Thees M. Kinne R. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1976; 362: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of an electroneutral Na/Picotransporter during growth is unknown. An electroneutral transporter would transport less Pi across the apical membrane of the proximal tubule, as the driving force for Na+ would be less. Two factors oppose the entry of Pi from the tubular lumen into the cell, the inside negative cell potential and the high intracellular Pi concentration. The intracellular Pi concentration measured in isolated perfused kidneys using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was significantly lower in growing animals than in adults (25Barac-Nieto M. Dowd T.L. Gupta R.K. Spitzer A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F153-F162PubMed Google Scholar). This provides a greater driving force for an electroneutral Na/Pi cotransporter in growing animals. However, further studies are needed to clarify the role of the electroneutral Na/Pi cotransporter in Pitransport. The type IIc transporter protein is detected in the apical membrane of renal proximal tubular cell in adult rats. Western blot analysis also shows that type IIc Na/Pi cotransporter is present in the BBMVs from adult rat kidneys. However, in the hybrid depletion experiment, type IIc antisense oligonucleotide did not affect the Pi uptake in oocytes induced by microinjection of renal poly(A)+ RNA from adult rats. These observations suggest that post-transcriptional regulation (e.g. regulatory protein) of type IIc is responsible for the discrepancy observed in the adult between the levels of type IIc mRNA and those of type IIc-like protein. Age dependence was also observed at the level of type IIa Na/Pi cotransporter protein expression (1Spitzer A. Barac-Nieto M. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2001; 16: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Taufiq A. Collins J.F. Ghishan F.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: R134-R141PubMed Google Scholar, 27Arar M. Zajicek H.K.

Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1407-1415PubMed Google Scholar). In the kidneys of newborn rats, expression of the type IIa Na/Picotransporter was observed in differentiated juxtamedullary and intermediate nephrons only and was absent in the outer cortex (28Traebert M. Lotscher M. Aschwanden R. Ritthaler T. Biber J. Murer H. Kaissling B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1407-1415PubMed Google Scholar). After completion of nephron formation, during suckling, expression of the transporter was similarly high in the brush-border membrane of all nephron generations. In weaning, the expression pattern resembled that in adults, i.e. type IIa abundance decreased in the brush-border membrane of superficial and midcortical nephrons (28Traebert M. Lotscher M. Aschwanden R. Ritthaler T. Biber J. Murer H. Kaissling B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1407-1415PubMed Google Scholar). Traebert et al. (28Traebert M. Lotscher M. Aschwanden R. Ritthaler T. Biber J. Murer H. Kaissling B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1407-1415PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the abundance of type IIa protein in the BBMVs of 22-day-old rats was decreased to ∼70% of that in 13-day-old rats. In contrast, renal type IIc protein was not detected in newborn and suckling rats, and was markedly increased in the superficial and midcortical regions of the kidney in weaning animals. The type IIc immunoreactive protein in those regions was gradually decreased and was detected in the deep nephrons in the adult kidney. The present findings suggest that the high expression of type IIc Na/Pi cotransporter in the kidney of weaning rats may support high Pi transport activity in weaning animals during down-regulation of the type IIa Na/Picotransporter. It is possible that the induction of type IIc protein in superficial nephrons in the weaning rats not only may be related to the developmental stage but also may be affected by the different Pi contents of the available food (28Traebert M. Lotscher M. Aschwanden R. Ritthaler T. Biber J. Murer H. Kaissling B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1407-1415PubMed Google Scholar). The suckling rats were fed exclusively with rat milk (0.2% Pi), and from day 20, the rats were fed the standard laboratory diet with a Pi content of 0.6% (29Luckey T.D. Mende T.J. Pleasants J. J. Nutr. 1954; 54: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Supplementing the Pi content may induce the type IIc protein in the weaning kidney. We therefore investigated the effect of dietary Pion the amount of type IIc protein. The findings of the present study suggest that a high Pi diet suppresses the expression of type IIc protein, whereas a low Pi diet increases the amount of type IIc protein in 40-day-old rats. It is suggested that the different levels of Pi food intake are not involved in the induction of type IIc protein in weaning rats. Hormonal changes occurring around the time of weaning might contribute to the observed changes in type IIa and type IIc abundance in the BBMVs. Recently, Hoag et al. (9Hoag H.H. Martel T. Gauthier C. Tenenhouse H.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) examined the effect Npt2 gene knock-out on age-dependent BBMVs Na/Picotransport and expression of Na/Pi cotransporter genes Npt1, Glvr-1, and Ram-1 (9Hoag H.H. Martel T. Gauthier C. Tenenhouse H.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). At all ages, Na/Pi cotransport in Npt2−/− mice is ∼15% of that in Npt2+/+ littermates. They concluded that Npt2−/− mice cannot be compensated for by the age-dependent increase in renal expression of type I and type III transporters (8Beck L. Karaplis A.S. Amizuka N. Hewson S. Ozawa H. Tenenhouse H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5372-5377Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 9Hoag H.H. Martel T. Gauthier C. Tenenhouse H.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). They also provided evidence that differences in the Npt2 protein abundance alone could account for the age-dependent decrease in Na/Pi cotransport in renal proximal tubules (8Beck L. Karaplis A.S. Amizuka N. Hewson S. Ozawa H. Tenenhouse H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5372-5377Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 9Hoag H.H. Martel T. Gauthier C. Tenenhouse H.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the present findings suggest that type IIc is highly expressed in the renal cortex in weaning animals and may support a demand of high Pi intake. A low Pi transport activity in the BBMV from Npt2−/− mice kidney may be due to the low expression of the type IIc Na/Pi cotransporter. Further studies are needed to clarify the regulation of type IIc Na/Pi cotransporter in Npt2−/− mice. Finally, the findings presented herein illustrate the mechanism by which the weaning kidney achieves the high rates of Pireabsorption required for the maintenance of a positive external balance. In this study, the type IIc was a growth-related renal Na/Pi cotransporter, which is highly expressed in the weaning kidney. We thank Dr. Hidekazu Arai, Misako Kawahara, R. Yanagida, K. Yano, R.

https://openalex.org/W2039876836,"When subjected to drought conditions, some organisms enter a state of suspended animation known as anhydrobiosis, surviving for indefinite periods until rehydration allows them to resume normal metabolism. We have identified a gene in the anhydrobiotic nematode Aphelenchus avenae that is upregulated in response to desiccation stress and whose encoded protein shares sequence similarity with a late-embryonic gene that is induced in many plants when they are deprived of water. This finding suggests that animals and plants that undergo anhydrobiosis may use common protective strategies against dehydration, and provides a unifying insight into the mechanism of anhydrobiosis."

The water/small solute-transporting protein aquaporin-3 (AQP3) was found by immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy to be expressed at the plasma membrane of epidermal keratinocytes in mouse skin. We studied the role of AQP3 in stratum corneum (SC) hydration by comparative measurements in wild-type and AQP3 null mice generated in a hairless SKH1 genetic background.

Surface conductance measurements showed remarkably reduced SC water content in AQP3 null mice in the hairless genetic background (165 ± 10 versus 269 ± 12 microsiemens (μS), p < 0.001), as well as in a CD1 genetic background (209 ± 21 versus 469 ± 11 μS). Reduced SC hydration was seen from 3 days after birth. SC hydration in hairless wild-type and AQP3 null mice was reduced to comparable levels (90–100 μS) after a 24-h exposure to a dry atmosphere, but the difference was increased when surface evaporation was prevented by occlusion or exposure to a humidified atmosphere (179 ± 13versus 441 ± 34 μS). Conductance measurements after serial tape stripping suggested reduced water content throughout the SC in AQP3 null mice. Water sorption-desorption experiments indicated reduced water holding capacity in the SC of AQP3 null mice. The impaired skin hydration in AQP3 null mice provides the first functional evidence for the involvement of AQP3 in skin physiology. Modulation of AQP3 expression or function may thus alter epidermal moisture content and water loss in skin diseases.

Modulation of AQP3 expression or function may thus alter epidermal moisture content and water loss in skin diseases. The water content of the stratum corneum is an important determinant of the appearance, physical properties, and barrier function of the skin (1.Blank I.H. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1965; 45: 249-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 2.Scheuplein R.J. Blank I.H. Physiol.

The stratum corneum, the most superficial layer of skin, consists of layers of flattened corneocytes (dead epidermal cells) embedded in a lipid-rich matrix containing specialized proteins and lipids (4.Elias P.M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1983; 80: 44-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Abnormalities of stratum corneum hydration are seen in a variety of hereditary and acquired skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (5.Watanabe M. Tagami H. Horii I. Takahashi M. Kligman A.M. Arch. Dermatol. 1991; 127: 1689-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), eczema (6.Thune P. Acta Derm. Venereol. 1989; 144: 133-135Google Scholar), psoriasis (7.Tagami H. Acta Derm.

Hydration of the stratum corneum could in principle be determined by a number of factors including the concentration of water-retaining osmolytes, the water and solute transporting properties of the underlying layers of viable epidermal keratinocytes, and the barrier properties of the stratum corneum. There is evidence for a high concentration of solutes (Na+, K+, and Cl−) and a low concentration of water (13–35%, Ref. 10.Takenouchi M. Suzuki H. Tagami H. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1986; 87: 574-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) in the superficial stratum corneum, producing in the steady-state gradients of both solutes and water from the skin surface to the viable epidermal keratinocytes (11.Warner R.R.

Although transepithelial fluid transporting properties have been studied extensively in various mammalian epithelia, the molecular mechanisms of fluid transport across epidermal keratinocyte layers remain poorly understood, as is the relationship between keratinocyte fluid transport and stratum corneum hydration. It has been proposed that aquaporin-3 (AQP3) 1The abbreviations used are: AQP3aquaporin-3RT-PCRreverse transcription PCRPBSphosphate-buffered salineμSmicrosiemens might facilitate transepidermal water permeability to protect the stratum corneum against desiccation by evaporative water loss from the skin surface and/or to dissipate water gradients in the epidermal keratinocyte cell layer (14.Sougrat, R., Morand, M., Gondran, C., Barre, P., Gobin R., Bonte, F., Dumas, M., and Verbavatz, J.

AQP3 is a member of a subclass of aquaporins, called aquaglyceroporins, which transport not only water but also glycerol and possibly other small solutes. AQP3-mediated water permeability was reported to be pH-dependent, decreasing at low pH (26.Zeuthen T. Klaerke D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21631-21636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The physiological role of AQP3-mediated glycerol transport has been the subject of considerable speculation but remains unknown. We first reported by immunocytochemistry the expression of AQP3 protein in epidermal keratinocytes in rat skin (15.Frigeri A. Gropper M.A. Umenishi F. Kawashima M. Brown D. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2993-3002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and subsequently AQP3 was localized in human keratinocytes (14.Sougrat, R., Morand, M., Gondran, C., Barre, P., Gobin R., Bonte, F., Dumas, M., and Verbavatz, J. M. (2002) J. Investig. Dermatol., in pressGoogle Scholar), and in moist noncornified barriers such as the mucous membranes in the mouth (16.Matsuzaki T. Suzuki T. Koyama H. Tanaka S. Takata K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1275-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It was reported recently that water permeability of human epidermal keratinocytes was inhibited by mercurials and low pH, consistent with the involvement of AQP3 (14.Sougrat, R., Morand, M., Gondran, C., Barre, P., Gobin R., Bonte, F., Dumas, M., and Verbavatz, J. M. (2002) J. Investig. Dermatol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Additional indirect evidence supporting a role for AQP3 in skin physiology includes the regulation of epidermal cell AQP3 expression by extracellular osmolality, barrier perturbation, and exposure to a dry atmosphere (27.Sugiyama Y. Ota Y. Hara M. Inoue S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1522: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 28.Tanaka M. Inase N. Fushimi K. Ishibashi K. Ichioka M. Sasaki S. Marumo F. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L1090-L1095PubMed Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether AQP3 is involved in stratum corneum hydration. Because humans with AQP3 deficiency have not been identified and nontoxic inhibitors of AQP3 are not yet available, we assessed skin phenotype in transgenic mice lacking AQP3. For studies in skin, the AQP3 null genotype, originally created in a CD1 genetic background (29.Ma T. Song Y. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), was transferred to the hairless SKH1 background. We found remarkably reduced stratum corneum water content in the skin of AQP3 null mice and investigated possible mechanisms for this defect. An interesting and unexpected finding was that AQP3 deletion remarkably impaired the ability of stratum corneum to become hydrated even when water loss from the skin surface was prevented by occlusion or exposure to a humidified atmosphere. The AQP3 null genotype originally generated in CD1 genetic background (29.Ma T. Song Y. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) was transferred to a hairless background by back-cross breeding of heterozygous AQP3 CD1 mice with SKH1 hairless mice. Hairless AQP3 heterozygous founder mice were bred to generate wild-type, heterozygous, and AQP3 null hairless mice. The mice were maintained in air-filtered cages and fed normal mouse chow in the University of California, San Francisco, Animal Care Facility. All procedures were approved by the UCSF Committee on Animal Research. 24-h urine output was measured using metabolic cages (Harvard Apparatus). Urine osmolality was measured by freezing-point osmometry (Precision Systems Inc.). Serum chemistries were measured by the UCSF Clinical Laboratory. Immunofluorescence was done on frozen sections of mouse skin fixed in PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde using a 1:200 dilution of affinity-purified anti-AQP3 rabbit polyclonal antibody. Slides were washed three times in PBS and incubated for 40 min at room temperature in PBS/bovine serum albumin containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled anti-rabbit antibody (10 μg/ml). Micrographs were obtained with a cooled CCD camera in an Olympus fluorescence microscope. For morphological examination by light microscopy, skin was fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde, and 2 μm plastic sections were stained with toluidine blue. For RT-PCR analysis, total RNA was isolated from the epidermis of wild-type and AQP3 null mice. RT-PCR was performed with sequence-specific sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers for mouse aquaporins 1–9 as described previously (23.Song Y. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41288-41292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Skin samples were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and embedded in Epon. 70-nm thick sections were cut on a Reichert-E ultramicrotome and collected on Formvar-coated electron microscopy grids. Sections were stained in 5% uranyl acetate for 3 min and then in lead citrate for 1 min, dried, and observed by electron microscopy (Philips CM 400). For immunogold labeling, skin samples were post-fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde + 0.1% glutaraldehyde and embedded in Unicryl. 70-nm thick sections were preincubated in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% fish gelatin, and 0.05% Tween 20 (TBuffer) followed by a 1-h incubation in affinity-purified anti-AQP3 antibody (1:50 dilution) in TBuffer. Grids were incubated in a 1:25 dilution of 10-nm gold-coupled anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, washed six times, stained in 5% uranyl acetate for 3 min and then in lead citrate for 1 min, dried, and observed by electron microscopy. For measurement of water permeability, epidermal sheets were freshly isolated from 6–8-week-old wild-type and AQP3 null mice by digesting full thickness skin fragments in 50 units/ml dispase solution (BD Biosciences) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing in cold PBS, the epidermis was peeled off the dermis. Small fragments of the epidermal sheets (∼12-mm diameter) were immobilized (surface facing downward) on 18-mm-diameter round coverglasses using superglue. The coverglass was mounted in a perfusion chamber (exchange time < 0.2 s) for measurement of osmotic water permeability by spatial filtering microscopy as described previously for studies in cultured cell layers and bladder sheets (30.Farinas J. Kneen M. Moore M. Verkman A.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and in kidney tubules (29.Ma T. Song Y. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The time course of transmitted light intensity was measured in response to changing between perfusate osmolalities of 300 (PBS) and 600 mosm (PBS containing 300 mmsucrose). For measurement of glycerol permeability, viable keratinocytes were isolated from epidermal sheets (prepared as above) by digestion in 0.5% trypsin solution for 10 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. After neutralizing with fetal bovine serum (10% final concentration), the cell suspension was centrifuged three times for 10 min at 800 × g. More than 95% of the cells were viable as judged by trypan blue exclusion. The keratinocyte cell suspension (∼106 cells/ml) was incubated for specified times with PBS containing tracer quantities of [3H]glycerol (Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature. After separating on glass fiber filters and washing three times with ice-cold PBS in a suction filtration apparatus, cells were disrupted with 1 m NaOH. Cell-associated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Protein concentration was measured using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Stratum corneum hydration was determined by high frequency electrical conductance using a Skicon-200 skin surface hygrometer (IBS). Three independent measurements from the same area of skin were averaged for each value. Measurements were performed on mice under normal conditions (external temperature 22 ± 2 °C, humidity 40 ± 3%) or on mice treated with various maneuvers including exposure to low (10%) and high (90%) external humidity, tape stripping, and topical occlusion. Water sorption-desorption studies were done as described (7.Tagami H. Acta Derm. Venereol. 1994; 185: 29-33PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Tagami H. Yoshikuni K. Arch. Dermatol. 1985; 121: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), where conductance was measured before and at 30-s intervals after pipetting 20 μl of distilled water onto the skin and blotting after 10 s. In some experiments, conductance measurements were conducted on shaved skin of wild-type and AQP3 null mice in the (hairy) CD1 genetic background. Stratum corneum layers were stripped and collected using Scotch cellophane tape. The stripped stratum corneum layers on the tape were dissolved in 1m NaOH for 1 h. After neutralization with 1m HCl, total protein concentration was measured using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Richmond, CA). To study skin phenotype, the AQP3 null mutation generated in CD1 mice was transferred to a SKH1 hairless genetic background by back-cross breeding. The AQP3 null hairless mice generated by breeding of heterozygous founder mice had normal perinatal survival and growth compared with wild-type littermates. However, the daily urine output of the AQP3 null mice was ∼10-fold greater than in wild-type mice (Fig. 1, A, top, andB). Urine osmolality in the AQP3 null hairless mice was very low (132 ± 22 versus 1974 ± 123 mosm in wild-type mice) when given free access to water (Fig., 1A, bottom). After a 24-h water deprivation, urine osmolality increased submaximally (481 ± 11versus 3792 ± 204 mosm in wild-type mice) (Fig. 1 A, bottom), indicating a urinary concentrating defect as found for AQP3 null mice in a CD1 genetic background (29.Ma T. Song Y. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Analysis of serum chemistries showed no differences in electrolyte concentrations, creatinine, and liver function tests, except for mild elevation in blood urea nitrogen (45 ± 4versus 29 ± 3 mg/dl) and decreased triglyceride concentration (110 ± 12 versus 166 ± 16 mg/dl). Immunofluorescence showed strong AQP3 protein expression in wild-type mice in a membrane pattern in the keratinocyte layer just below the stratum corneum (Fig. 2 A). Immunogold electron microscopy indicated plasma membrane localization of AQP3 protein in epidermal keratinocytes (Fig. 2 B). Antibody staining was absent in AQP3 null mice. RT-PCR analysis of mRNA isolated from epidermis using primers specific for aquaporins 0–9 revealed only AQP3 transcript in wild-type mice and no aquaporins in AQP3 null mice (Fig. 2 C). The general structure of the epidermis was studied by light and electron microscopy. Light microscopy of plastic-embedded sections of epidermis stained with toluidine blue revealed similar thickness and structure of the stratum corneum and epidermal cell layers (Fig. 2 D). Thickness measurements on a series of sections showed no significant differences in the stratum corneum, epidermal, or dermal layers (Fig. 2 E). The thickness of the innermost fat layer was reduced in the AQP3 null mice (p < 0.01), which may be related to the relative serum hypotriglyceridemia. Transmission electron microscopy showed no apparent differences in the structures of the stratum corneum and keratinocytes in wild-type (Fig. 3, A and C) and AQP3 null (Fig. 3, B and D) mice. At the apex of the epidermis (Fig. 3, A and B), the stratum corneum contained five layers in both wild-type and AQP3 null mice, with each layer of a similar thickness. Keratohyalin granules seen in the superficial epidermal cells were of similar size in wild-type and AQP3 null mice. As expected, keratinocytes at the base of the epidermis (Fig. 3, C and D) were taller but showed no differences between genotypes. Despite the possible consequences of AQP3 deficiency on water movement, intercellular spaces were not dilated in AQP3 null mice from the base to the surface of the epidermis. Osmotic water and glycerol permeability were measured to investigate the functionality of plasma membrane AQP3 in epidermal keratinocytes. Osmotic water permeability was measured by spatial filtering light microscopy using fragments of epidermis (isolated by dispase digestion), which were mounted in a perfusion chamber with epidermal keratinocytes facing upward. Fig. 4 A (left) shows the reversible time course of keratinocyte layer shrinking and swelling in response to the changing of perfusate osmolality between 300 and 600 mosm. Fitted reciprocal exponential time constants (proportional to water permeability; Fig. 4 A,right) were significantly reduced by ∼4-fold in epidermis of AQP3 null mice. Because of the possible unstirred layer effects in the multilayered epidermis, which limits observed water permeability, the 4-fold difference formally represents a lower limit to the difference in epidermal water permeability in wild-typeversus AQP3 null mice. Glycerol permeability was measured from the uptake of radiolabeled [3H]glycerol in suspensions of freshly isolated keratinocytes. Measurements in keratinocytes from wild-type mice indicated approximately linear [3H]glycerol uptake for 10 min (not shown). Fig. 4 B shows that the average [3H]glycerol uptake at 90 s (after subtraction of bound [3H]glycerol uptake by 0 time measurement) was significantly reduced in keratinocytes from AQP3 null mice. The ∼2-fold reduction in glycerol permeability represents a lower limit to the difference in epidermal glycerol permeability in wild-typeversus AQP3 null mice because of possible effects of the protease treatment (needed to release keratinocytes) on AQP3 function. These results establish the functionality of AQP3 as a water/glycerol transporter in mouse epidermis. Stratum corneum water content was measured using a well established surface conductance method (32.Tagami H. Ohi M. Iwatsuki K. Kanamaru Y. Yamada M. Ichijo B. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1980; 75: 500-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Surface electrical conductance is approximately linearly related to percentage water content of the outer stratum corneum (33.Obata M. Tagami H. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 854-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 Ashows remarkably reduced skin conductance in different areas of the skin in adult hairless AQP3 null mice measured under standard atmospheric conditions (22 °C, 40% relative humidity). The greatest differences was found in the upper abdominal skin, with ∼50% reduced conductance in the AQP3 null mice. To confirm that these observations are not unique to the hairless genetic background, skin conductance was measured at 1 day after shaving the mid-back skin of CD1 mice. Although skin conductance was greater in the CD1 than the hairless background, there remained a large effect of AQP3 deletion (209 ± 21versus 469 ± 11 μS in wild-type mice). Skin conductance was measured in mice of different ages to determine when the defect in stratum corneum hydration is first manifest. As summarized in Fig. 5 B, skin conductance was low and similar at 1 and 2 days after birth but was significantly lower by day 3 in AQP3 null mice compared with wild-type mice. Skin conductance increased substantially during the first month in wild-type mice, to a much greater extent than in AQP3 null mice. To test the hypothesis that decreased stratum corneum hydration in AQP3 null mice is due to impaired replacement of surface evaporative losses by water transport across epidermal keratinocytes, conductance measurements were performed after subjecting mice to different external humidity conditions and after skin surface occlusion. Exposure to 10% humidity increases evaporative water loss, whereas exposure to 90% humidity or surface occlusion prevents evaporative water loss. The prediction is that the defective stratum corneum hydration in AQP3 null mice would be corrected by preventing evaporation but exaggerated by exposure to a 10% humidity atmosphere. Fig. 5 C summarizes conductance measurements. Exposure to 90% humidity or occlusion for 24 h resulted in increased stratum corneum hydration in wild-type mice, but contrary to expectations, the impaired hydration in AQP3 null mice was not corrected. Also, contrary to expectations, skin conductance of the wild-type and AQP3 null mice became similar after exposure to 10% humidity. Fig. 5 D shows the full time courses of skin conductance after changing external humidity. In both cases the new steady-state conductance was achieved in 2–4 h but with a small undershoot for exposure to 10% humidity. To investigate whether the impaired hydration occurs in deeper layers of the stratum corneum of AQP3 null mice, conductance measurements were made after layers of the stratum corneum were removed progressively by cellophane tape (tape stripping). Fig. 6 A shows that the accumulated total protein was approximately linear with the number of tape strippings and that the amount of protein removed was similar in wild-type and AQP3 null mice. Fig. 6 B shows the correlation between skin conductance and total accumulated protein for a series of wild-type and AQP3 null mice subjected to serial tape stripping. Hydration increased progressively as deeper layers of the stratum corneum were exposed by tape stripping, which supports the notion of a water gradient from deep to superficial stratum corneum (12.Warner R.R. Myers M.C. Taylor D.A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1988; 90: 218-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 34.Warner R.R. Boissy Y.L. Lilly N.A. Spears M.J. McKillop K. Marshall J.L. Stone K.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 960-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Skin conductance was lower in AQP3 null mice, but the steepness of the water gradient was increased. These results are consistent with the notion that a water gradient is established from the well hydrated epidermal keratinocytes through the relatively water-poor and watertight stratum corneum. The results shown in Figs. 5 and 6 provide evidence against the hypothesis that impaired hydration in the stratum corneum of AQP3 null mice results from decreased epidermal water permeability. We tested whether the stratum corneum of AQP3 null mice has an intrinsic defect in its ability to be hydrated and in its “water holding capacity,” as found in diseases associated with dry skin. An established sorption-desorption test was used in which skin conductance is measured before and at different times after a 10-s exposure of the skin to distilled water (32.Tagami H. Ohi M. Iwatsuki K. Kanamaru Y. Yamada M. Ichijo B. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1980; 75: 500-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 C shows that skin conductance increased immediately after water exposure and then recovered over a few min. The initial increase in skin conductance, which was significantly greater in wild-type mice, has been taken as a measure of the ability of the stratum corneum to become hydrated. More importantly, the recovery after hydration has been taken as a measure of the water holding capacity of the stratum corneum. The area under the recovery curve (after subtraction of prehydration conductance) has been used as a single parameter describing water holding capacity (10.Takenouchi M. Suzuki H. Tagami H. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1986; 87: 574-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The recovery area parameter was remarkably reduced in AQP3 null mice (8.2 ± 1.7 × 104 versus 4.5 ± 1.9 × 104 μS·s, p < 0.005) (see “Discussion”). The goal of this study was to determine whether AQP3 plays a role in skin physiology. As discussed in the Introduction, previous findings of AQP3 expression and regulation in epidermal keratinocytes provided indirect evidence for a role of AQP3 in skin function. To facilitate the study of stratum corneum hydration, the AQP3 null genotype was transferred to a SKH1 hairless background. The hairless AQP3 null mice manifested a urinary concentrating defect with polyuria and reduced urinary osmolality, as found previously for AQP3 null mice in the CD1 background (29.Ma T. Song Y. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). AQP3 null CD1 mice develop progressive renal failure with dilatation of the kidneys and urinary bladder by 8 weeks of life (35.Yang B. Ma T. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 624-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) but have unimpaired function of the airways (36.Song Y. Jayaraman S. Yang B. Matthay M.A. Verkman A.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), another major site of AQP3 expression. The hairless AQP3 null mice had normal perinatal survival, growth, and serum chemistries, except for a mild elevation in blood urea nitrogen and a decrease in serum triglyceride concentration. We do not believe that these mild alterations in blood chemistry cause the abnormalities in stratum corneum hydration in AQP3 null mice. The decreased stratum corneum hydration was found in AQP3 null mice at 4 weeks of age before changes in blood urea nitrogen were detected, and AQP1 null mice have an even greater degree of serum hypotriglyceridemia (37.Ma T. Jayaraman S. Wang K.S. Song Y. Li J. Bastidas J.A. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C126-C134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but do not manifest altered stratum corneum hydration. Adequate stratum corneum hydration is important in maintaining skin plasticity and barrier integrity. The stratum corneum gains water from underlying viable layers of epidermis and dermis to maintain its proper hydration status in the relatively dry external environment. There are several possible mechanisms by which AQP3 deletion might affect stratum corneum hydration. Reduced epidermal water permeability might impair water transport into the stratum corneum, which would lead to decreased stratum corneum water content when surface evaporation occurs but not when the skin surface is occluded or exposed to a humidified environment. Reduced permeability of the epidermal cell layer to glycerol or other small solutes might produce alternations in the composition and/or structure of the stratum corneum that alter its ability to hold water even when surface evaporation is blocked. High aquaporin-dependent water permeability in the epidermal cell layer might prevent water gradients within the viable keratinocytes, preserving their normal biosynthetic functions. However, it seems unlikely that water gradients are present in the layer of viable keratinocytes because water permeability of the stratum corneum is orders of magnitude lower than in the keratinocyte layer (38.Spruit D. Dermatologica. 1970; 141: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Transport measurements showed significantly reduced water and glycerol permeability in AQP3 null mice. These results are consistent with localization of AQP3 in the plasma membrane of keratinocytes, as shown by immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy, and with the absence of the compensatory expression of another aquaporin in epidermis of AQP3 null mice, as shown by RT-PCR. The finding of functional expression of AQP3 in mouse epidermis agrees with the conclusion of a recent study showing that apparent water permeability in human epidermis was inhibited by mercurials and low pH (14.Sougrat, R., Morand, M., Gondran, C., Barre, P., Gobin R., Bonte, F., Dumas, M., and Verbavatz, J. M. (2002) J. Investig. Dermatol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Utilizing a spatial filtering approach to measure osmotic water permeability in freshly isolated, intact epidermal sheets, we found that AQP3 deletion produced an ∼4-fold reduction in water permeability. This approach preserves the normal epidermal anatomy, and unlike keratinocyte isolation procedures, the isolation of epidermal sheets does not require digestion with proteases. In other studies we have found up to 10-fold reductions in water permeability after aquaporin deletion, for example in erythrocytes (35.Yang B. Ma T. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 624-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the proximal tubule (19.Schnermann J. Chou C.L. Ma T. Traynor T. Knepper M.A. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9660-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), and the thin descending limb of Henle (39.Chou C.L. Knepper M.A. van Hoek A.N. Brown D. Yang B. Ma T. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) of AQP1 null mice and in the lungs of AQP1 and AQP5 null mice (20.Ma T. Fukuda N. Song Y. Matthay M.A. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 21.Bai C. Fukuda N. Song Y. Matthay M.A. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The relatively small reduction in epidermal water permeability in AQP3 null mice may be related to the relatively weak intrinsic water transporting activity of AQP3 compared with other aquaporins (40.Yang B. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16140-16146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In addition, unstirred layer effects in the multilayered epidermal sheet would decrease apparent osmotic water permeability and blunt the effects of AQP3 deletion. Nevertheless, the results shown here prove that AQP3 is functional as a plasma membrane water/glycerol transporter in the epidermis, but they provide only a lower limit to the contribution of AQP3 to total water permeability. Conductance measurements showed remarkably reduced stratum corneum water content in AQP3 null mice in most areas of the skin, despite grossly normal morphology by light and electron microscopy. Reduced stratum corneum hydration was also seen in AQP3 null mice in the CD1 genetic background. The defect in stratum corneum hydration was seen as early as 3 days after birth in the hairless AQP3 null mice, and from tape stripping experiments it appeared to involve the full stratum corneum thickness. Exposure of the skin to moist and dry humidity conditions produced fairly prompt changes in stratum corneum hydration as a new steady state was reached for surface evaporative water loss versuswater movement into the stratum corneum through the epidermal cell layer. The surprising observation was that stratum corneum hydration in AQP3 null mice increased little in a humidified environment and with surface occlusion, despite a marked increase in hydration in the wild-type mice. In a dry environment, stratum corneum hydration decreased to comparable levels in wild-type and AQP3 null mice. These results provide evidence against the hypothesis that a major function of epidermal AQP3 is to facilitate water movement into the stratum corneum. Instead, the AQP3 null mice appear to manifest an intrinsic defect in the stratum corneum that limits its ability to accumulate water. Water sorption-desorption studies supported the conclusion that the stratum corneum of AQP3 null mice has an intrinsic defect in its ability to absorb and hold water. The determination of the molecular mechanism by which AQP3 deletion impairs hydration and water holding in the stratum corneum will require analysis of the peptide, lipid, and carbohydrate composition of the stratum corneum and epidermis, as well as high resolution structural studies. In addition, the identification of specific proteins in the stratum corneum and keratinocytes that are up-regulated in AQP3 deficiency may be informative, especially if they are involved in the biosynthetic pathways for generation of water-retaining osmolytes or specialized barrier lipids. Although direct evidence is not yet available, we suspect that defective glycerol/small solute transport in the epidermis of AQP3 null mice is the basis of their abnormal hydration. Studies of non-skin phenotypes in aquaporin-deficient mice support the conclusion that epidermal cell water permeability is probably not a major determinant of stratum corneum hydration. Water movement across the stratum corneum is very slow compared with other tissues, such as the proximal tubule and secretory epithelia, where aquaporins are important. Also, water movement into and through the stratum corneum is likely to be limited by unstirred layers rather than the intrinsic water permeability of the epidermal cell layer. Further studies are needed to determine whether water and/or glycerol transport by AQP3 is essential for normal hydration of the stratum corneum. In summary, the impaired stratum corneum hydration in AQP3 null mice provides the first functional evidence for the involvement of AQP3 in skin physiology. Although the exact mechanism for impaired stratum corneum water holding remains to be established, we propose that pharmacological modulation of AQP3 expression or function may alter epidermal moisture content and water loss. Controlled modulation of skin moisture content and barrier function may thus be useful in the treatment of skin disorders associated with abnormally wet, dry, or permeable skin.

https://openalex.org/W2065471991,"Data from cell culture and animal models of prion disease support the separate involvement of both heparan sulfate proteoglycans and copper (II) ions in prion (PrP) metabolism. Though direct interactions between prion protein and heparin have been recorded, little is known of the structural features implicit in this interaction or of the involvement of copper (II) ions. Using biosensor and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methodology we report direct heparin and heparan sulfate-binding activity in recombinant cellular prion protein (PrP(c)). We also demonstrate that the interaction of recombinant PrP(c) with heparin is weakened in the presence of Cu(II) ions and is particularly sensitive to competition with dextran sulfate. Competitive inhibition experiments with chemically modified heparins also indicate that 2-O-sulfate groups (but not 6-O-sulfate groups) are essential for heparin recognition. We have also identified three regions of the prion protein capable of independent binding to heparin and heparan sulfate: residues 23-52, 53-93, and 110-128. Interestingly, the interaction of an octapeptide-spanning peptide motif amino acids 53-93 with heparin is enhanced by Cu(II) ions. Significantly, a peptide of this sequence is able to inhibit the binding of full-length prion molecule to heparin, suggesting a direct role in heparin recognition within the intact protein. The collective data suggest a complex interaction between prion protein and heparin/heparan sulfate and has implications for the cellular and pathological functions of prion proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2084113115,"Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) is implicated as the toxic agent in Alzheimer's disease and is the major component of brain amyloid plaques. In vitro, Abeta causes cell death, but the molecular mechanisms are unclear. We analyzed the early signaling mechanisms involved in Abeta toxicity using the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. Abeta caused cell death and induced a 2- to 3-fold activation of JNK. JNK activation and cell death were inhibited by overexpression of a dominant-negative SEK1 (SEK1-AL) construct. Butyrolactone I, a cdk5 inhibitor, had an additional protective effect against Abeta toxicity in these SEK1-AL-expressing cells suggesting that cdk5 and JNK activation independently contributed to this toxicity. Abeta also weakly activated ERK and Akt but had no effect on p38 kinase. Inhibitors of ERK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways did not affect Abeta-induced cell death, suggesting that these pathways were not important in Abeta toxicity. Insulin-like growth factor I protected against Abeta toxicity by strongly activating ERK and Akt and blocking JNK activation in a PI3K-dependent manner. Pertussis toxin also blocked Abeta-induced cell death and JNK activation suggesting that G(i/o) proteins were upstream activators of JNK. The results suggest that activation of the JNK pathway and cdk5 may be initial signaling cascades in Abeta-induced cell death."

Each kRT-PCR assay was performed in a 20-μl reaction tube containing: 50 mm Tricine buffer, pH 8.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 13% glycerol, 0.3 mmdATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 0.05 mm dTTP, 0.5 mmdUTP, 2.4 mm Mn(OAc)2, 2.5 μmethidium bromide, 0.25 μm primers, 4 units of rTth DNA polymerase, 2 units of uracilN-glycosylase, and 120 ng of total yeast cellular RNA template. Yeast strains were grown to early log phase in YP medium containing 2% glucose. Total cellular RNA was extracted from glass bead-disrupted cells and treated with RNase-free DNase I to eliminate residual genomic DNA (5.Kang J.J. Watson R.M. Fisher M.E. Higuchi R. Gelfand D.H. Holland M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28 (nar.oupjournals.org/): e2Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Primer pair design, instrumentation, and data analysis were as described previously (5.Kang J.J. Watson R.M. Fisher M.E. Higuchi R. Gelfand D.H. Holland M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28 (nar.oupjournals.org/): e2Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Transcript copy numbers per cell reported here are the average of 15 independent kRT-PCR assays for each mRNA. To assess the range of expression levels for genes along a single chromosome, transcripts from all 65 genes and computationally annotated ORFs on the left arm of yeast chromosome III were quantitated. Steady-state transcript copy number varied by more than four orders of magnitude, from GLK1 (glucokinase) at 17 copies per cell to YCL069 at 0.001 copy per cell (Fig. 1). With the exception of low abundance transcripts encoded by six ORFs located between the telomere and the HML locus (0.04–0.001 transcript per cell), no obvious clustering of genes encoding highversus low abundance transcripts was detected. The majority of abundant transcripts (2.2–17 transcripts per cell) encoded by 12 genes on the left arm of chromosome III code for metabolic enzymes. In contrast to mRNAs encoding metabolic enzymes, those encoding transcription factors should be representative of low abundance transcripts. As expected, steady-state levels for 185 transcription factor genes varied over four orders of magnitude with the majority (82%) present at 1 or less transcript per yeast cell (Fig. 2). GCN4 encodes a leucine zipper transcription factor involved in general amino acid control and was the most abundant at 7 copies per cell. The relatively high level of GCN4 mRNA may compensate for the fact that translation of this mRNA in vivo is under strong negative control (6.Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). SPT15, which encodes TBP (TATA-binding protein), required for all nuclear transcription (7.Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) was present at 0.8 copy per cell whereas the SUA7 transcript, encoding TFIIB, required for all transcription by RNA polymerase II (8.Pinto I. Ware D.E. Hampsey M. Cell. 1992; 68: 977-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) was present at 4 copies per cell. Transcripts encoding TAFs (TBP associatedfactors) (9.Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), subunits of the SRB-mediator complex (9.Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the swi-snf complex (9.Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) ranged from 2 to 0.1 copies per cell with the majority present at 1 to 0.5 transcripts per cell. Transcripts encoding eight members of the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors (TYE7, INO4, RTG3, PHO4, INO2, RTG1, HMS1, and CBF1) ranged from 3 to 0.09 transcripts/cell.IXR1, GAT1, GLN3, SWI6, and SPT3 (0.0009, 0.002, 0.004, 0.005, and 0.005 transcripts per cell, respectively) encoded very low transcript levels. To fully assess low level transcription in yeast cells, expression of the mating-type specific regulatory genes was determined using total cellular RNA isolated from haploid and diploid cells (Fig. 3). Expression of the regulatory genes present at the silent mating type cassette HMLα measured in mating type a haploid cells or the silent mating type cassette HMRa measured in mating type α haploid cells was not detected using the kRT-PCR assay (less than 0.0001 transcript per cell). Similarly, α1 expression in diploid cells was not detected using the kRT-PCR assay. Expression of the regulatory genes at theMAT locus was very similar for the strains derived from S288C or D27310B. Unexpectedly, expression of a1 and α2 in diploid cells was 4- to 5-fold lower than in mating type a haploid cells or mating type α haploid cells, respectively. Hybridization-based cDNA microarray and high density oligonucleotide array technologies are widely used for transcript profiling. To access the detection limits and accuracy of the cDNA microarray assay for quantitating the full range of yeast transcript abundance, cDNA microarray raw fluorescence data (10.DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar) were plottedversus transcript copy number per cell as determined by kRT-PCR assay for 275 yeast transcripts, Fig. 4 a. These genes include: 25 relatively high abundance mRNAs coding for enzymes involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, ethanol synthesis, and glycerol metabolism, previously quantitated by kRT-PCR (5.Kang J.J. Watson R.M. Fisher M.E. Higuchi R. Gelfand D.H. Holland M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28 (nar.oupjournals.org/): e2Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); 65 transcripts encoded by genes on the left arm of chromosome III; and the 185 transcription factor transcripts described above. Both sets of data were for early log phase cultures of a derivative of strain S288C grown in YPD medium (10.DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). The plot recapitulates a second order hybridization curve where most of the change in fluorescence occurs between 1 and 100 transcript copies per cell. Below 1 transcript per cell, the fluorescence data are scattered, and the large changes in transcript copy number per cell as measured by kRT-PCR assay are not evidenced in the raw fluorescence data. A similar curve is obtained when expression levels measured by high density oligonucleotide arrays for log phase cultures of a derivative of strain S288C grown in YPD medium (11.Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar) were plotted versus transcript copy number per cell determined by kRT-PCR assay (Fig. 4 b). An exponential curve fit to these latter data displays a breakpoint at about 2 transcript copies per cell (Fig. 4 c). Transcript copy numbers per cell, determined by kRT-PCR, are in reasonable agreement with both array analyses down to 2 copies per cell. Below 2 transcripts per cell, however, there is little coincidence between raw fluorescence determined by cDNA microarray or expression level determined by high density oligonucleotide array and transcript copy number per cell determined by kRT-PCR. Furthermore, transcripts displaying significant deviation (scatter) from the exponential curve fit for the cDNA microarray data (Fig. 4 a) are different from those displaying significant deviation from the exponential curve fit for the high density oligonucleotide array data (Fig. 4 b). The results presented here using kinetically monitored RT-PCR extend previous hybridization complexity (1.Hereford L.M. Rosbash M. Cell. 1977; 10: 453-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and SAGE (2.Velculescu V.E. Zhang L. Zhou W. Vogelstein J. Basrai M.A. Bassett Jr., D.E. Hieter P. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 243-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar) analyses to reveal the full range of transcript abundance in yeast. Yeast transcript abundance ranged from a few hundred copies per cell for glycolytic mRNAs to one-thousandth transcript per cell for transcripts encoding some of the transcription factors. No transcripts were detected from the silent mating type loci in haploid cells or α1 in diploid cells (less than 0.0001 transcript per cell). Consistent with these latter observations, the HMα andHMRa loci are subject to active transcriptional silencing mechanisms (12.Laurenson P. Rine J. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 543-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and α1 expression in diploid cells is repressed by the diploid cell-specific a1/α2 repressor (13.Herskowitz I. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 536-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, specialized silencing or repression mechanisms are necessary to reduce transcription below the detection level of the kRT-PCR assay. Taken together, these results show that yeast transcript abundance varies over six orders of magnitude. The physiological importance of low level transcripts is illustrated by the α1 transcript (0.003 and 0.008 transcript/cell in the S288C and D273-10B α haploid strains, respectively), which encodes a transcription factor required for expression of α-specific genes (13.Herskowitz I. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 536-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of transcripts encoded by IXR1, GAT1, GLN3, SWI6, and SPT3 (0.0009, 0.002, 0.004, 0.005, and 0.005 transcript per cell, respectively) are comparable with or below those observed for the telomere proximal ORFs described above for chromosome III. Remarkably, the level of the IXR1 transcript is comparable with the level of “readthrough” transcript observed for the intergenic region between the divergently transcribed yeastGAL1 and GAL10 genes (0.00075 copy per cell) (5.Kang J.J. Watson R.M. Fisher M.E. Higuchi R. Gelfand D.H. Holland M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28 (nar.oupjournals.org/): e2Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This latter steady-state concentration would be obtained if a transcript with a half-life of 10 min were synthesized once during a 2-h cell division cycle. Because cellular proteins are typically more stable than the mRNAs that encode them and because the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm are shared during cell division, very low steady-state levels of mRNA can direct synthesis of physiologically important proteins. IXR1 encodes a high mobility group domain protein that binds cisplatin-DNA adducts and represses transcription of the yeast COX5b gene (14.McA'Nulty M.M. Whitehead J.P. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6089-6099Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). GAT1 andGLN3 encode members of the GATA transcription factor family involved in activation of transcription of genes subject to nitrogen catabolite repression (15.Cunningham T.S. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6584-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The SWI6 gene product is involved in regulation of transcription at the G1/S boundary of the mitotic cell cycle (16.Koch C. Moll T. Neuberg M. Ahorn H. Nasmyth K. Science. 1993; 261: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Finally, SPT3encodes a subunit of the SAGA complex involved in histone acetylation (17.Grant P.A. Duggan L. Côté J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). The kRT-PCR assay and the hybridization-based array technologies were compared with respect to transcript detection and quantitation of the 250 yeast transcripts reported here and 25 abundant transcripts previously quantitated by kRT-PCR (5.Kang J.J. Watson R.M. Fisher M.E. Higuchi R. Gelfand D.H. Holland M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28 (nar.oupjournals.org/): e2Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using published array data for the same transcripts (10.DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar, 11.Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). The comparison reveals some significant limitations for array-based detection and quantitation of yeast transcript present at one or fewer copies per cell. The analysis shows that these limitations are imposed by the second order nature of hybridization kinetics. Whereas the array technologies offer the advantage of relatively high throughput analysis of large numbers of transcripts, kRT-PCR offers clear advantages for monitoring mRNA levels over the complete range of intracellular levels. This is an important consideration because the majority of yeast transcripts are present at one or fewer copies per cell. These detection limits are not restricted to yeast, however, because the intracellular range of transcript abundance in bacteria as well as metazoans is likely to be comparable with yeast when adjusted for cell volume and RNA content. The sensitivity of the kRT-PCR assay is ideally suited for assessing whether or not computationally annotated ORFs revealed by genomic sequences are expressed. More generally, kRT-PCR measures the full range of change in transcript level in different genetic, physiological, or developmental changes whereas the array technologies are likely to underestimate the magnitude of such changes. This latter point is illustrated for yeast genes that are subject to carbon catabolite repression. Derepression of the yeast phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1), fructose bisphosphatase (FBP1), and iso-1-cytochrome c (CYC1) genes measured by kRT-PCR for cells grown on a nonfermentable carbon source versus glucose were 1000-, 200-, and 40-fold, respectively (5.Kang J.J. Watson R.M. Fisher M.E. Higuchi R. Gelfand D.H. Holland M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28 (nar.oupjournals.org/): e2Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Derepression of these same genes measured by cDNA microarray after diauxic shift (the switch from growth on glucose to nonfermentative growth on the products of glycolysis, ethanol and glycerol) were 14-, 13-, and 3-fold, respectively (10.DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). The levels of these transcripts are above 1 copy per cell after diauxic shift; however, the fully repressed levels of these mRNAs are well below the detection limit of the cDNA microarray assay. Thus, large changes in gene expression can be underestimated or entirely missed by microarray assay depending on the abundance range over which a particular transcript varies.

https://openalex.org/W2046207936,"ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteases) are members of the metzincin superfamily of metalloproteases. Among integrins binding to disintegrin domains of ADAMs are α9β1 and αvβ3, and they bind in an RGD-independent and an RGD-dependent manner, respectively. Human ADAM15 is the only ADAM with the RGD motif in the disintegrin domain. Thus, both integrin α9β1 and αvβ3 recognize the ADAM15 disintegrin domain. We determined how these integrins recognize the ADAM15 disintegrin domain by mutational analysis. We found that the Arg481 and the Asp-Leu-Pro-Glu-Phe residues (residues 488–492) were critical for α9β1 binding, but the RGD motif (residues 484–486) was not. In contrast, the RGD motif was critical for αvβ3 binding, but the other residues flanking the RGD motif were not. As the R X6DLPEF α9β1recognition motif (residues 481–492) is conserved among ADAMs, except for ADAM10 and 17, we hypothesized that α9β1 may recognize disintegrin domains in all ADAMs except ADAM10 and 17. Indeed we found that α9β1 bound avidly to the disintegrin domains of ADAM1, 2, 3, and 9 but not to the disintegrin domains of ADAM10 and 17. As several ADAMs have been implicated in sperm-oocyte interaction, we tested whether the functional classification of ADAMs, based on specificity for integrin α9β1, applies to sperm-egg binding. We found that the ADAM2 and 15 disintegrin domains bound to oocytes, but the ADAM17 disintegrin domain did not. Furthermore, the ADAM2 and 15 disintegrin domains effectively blocked binding of sperm to oocytes, but the ADAM17 disintegrin domain did not. These results suggest that oocytes and α9β1 have similar binding specificities for ADAMs and that α9β1, or a receptor with similar specificity, may be involved in sperm-egg interaction during fertilization. As α9β1 is a receptor for many ADAM disintegrins and α9β1 and ADAMs are widely expressed, α9β1-ADAM interaction may be of a broad biological importance.

The ADAMs on the sperm surface are processed and lack the pro- and metalloprotease domains; thus the disintegrin domains of ADAMs may be the most important in sperm-egg binding.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, oocytes from α6-null mice can be fertilized in vitro (27Miller B.J. Georges-Labouesse E. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and anti-integrin α6 subunit monoclonal antibody does not always block sperm binding (28Evans J.P. Kopf G.S. Schultz R.M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, it is still unclear whether α6β1 is the main or only integrin involved in sperm-egg interaction, and the specificity, occurrence, and significance of integrin-ADAM binding in other cells and tissues are not known (for review, see Ref. 23Evans J.P. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 628-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the present study, we analyzed how integrins αvβ3 and α9β1recognize the ADAM15 disintegrin domain by mutating amino acid residues in the putative integrin-binding site of the disintegrin domain (Fig. 1 a). We found that αvβ3 and α9β1 recognize distinct motifs in the disintegrin domain, the RGD (residues 484–486) and the R X6DLPEF (residues 481–492) motifs, respectively. The R X6DLPEF α9β1 recognition motif is conserved among ADAMs, except for ADAM10 and 17, and we provide evidence that α9β1 recognizes several, perhaps all, ADAM disintegrins with this motif. We also found that oocytes and α9β1 have similar binding specificities for ADAM disintegrin domains and propose that α9β1, or a receptor with similar specificity, may be involved in sperm-oocyte interaction during fertilization. Considering that α9β1 and ADAMs are widely expressed, α9β1-ADAM interactions may have a broad significance in many biological and pathological processes such as fertilization, development, and tissue remodeling. Complementary DNA fragments encoding the disintegrin domain of ADAMs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned in a pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (16Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7345-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The disintegrin domains were derived from mouse ADAM1 (Arg246–Gln334), mouse ADAM2 (Lys388–Pro479), mouse ADAM3 (Gly394–Glu486), human ADAM9 (Ser413–Tyr503), mouse ADAM10 (Gly457–Thr554), human ADAM15 (Met420–Glu510), mouse ADAM15 (Met421–Glu511), and mouse ADAM17 (Ser474–Thr565). GST fusion proteins were produced and purified as described previously (16Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7345-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Absorbance at 280 nm was measured to determine the concentration of purified proteins, and the amount of proteins was calculated as described previously (16Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7345-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In some experiments, because GST binds to the egg plasma membrane (24Bigler D. Takahashi Y. Chen M.S. Almeida E.A. Osbourne L. White J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11576-11584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), disintegrin domains used for bead coating (see below) were released from the GST by incubating with thrombin (1 unit/mg of protein) for 6 h at room temperature, and the free GST was removed by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography. CHO cells expressing αvβ3, human α6, or human α9 (designated β3-, α6-, or α9-CHO cells, respectively) have been described elsewhere (17Eto K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Sheppard D. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Zhang X.P. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34922-34930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Adhesion assays were performed as described previously (16Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7345-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Briefly, wells of 96-well Immulon-2 microtiter plates (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) were coated with substrates in 100 μl of PBS (10 mm phosphate buffer, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4) overnight at 4 °C. Remaining protein-binding sites were blocked by incubating with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Calbiochem) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, CHO cells (105 cells/well) in 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% BSA were added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After unbound cells were removed by rinsing the wells with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, bound cells were quantified by measuring endogenous phosphatase activity (29Prater C.A. Plotkin J. Jaye D. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Three-week-old B6129PF1/J female mice (Jackson Laboratory) were superovulated using standard hormonal treatment. Oocytes were collected 12–13 h after administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin, and cumulus cells were removed by incubation with hyaluronidase in Flushing and Holding medium (Specialty Media) for 5 min at 37 °C. The zona pellucida were softened in Flushing and Holding medium containing 10 μg/ml α-chymotrypsin (Sigma) and then removed by passing the eggs through a narrow pipette as described previously (5Almeida E.A. Huovila A.P. Sutherland A.E. Stephens L.E. Calarco P.G. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Sonnenberg A. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1095-1104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Zona pellucida-free eggs were allowed to recover in fertilization medium composed of Human Tubal Fluid medium (Irvine Scientific) supplemented with 5 mg/ml BSA fraction V (Sigma) for 1–2 h at 37 °C under mineral oil in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Sperms were collected from 3–6-month-old B6129F1 male mice (Taconic Farms) by placing the cauda of the epididymis and the vas deferens in 1 ml of fertilization medium under mineral oil. Each tissue was slit open with the edge of an injection needle. Sperms were allowed to swim out for 20 min at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Tissues were removed from the medium, and spermatozoa were capacitated for 2–3 h under the same conditions. The sperm concentration was estimated with a hemocytometer. Fluorescent beads (0.2-μm yellow-green sulfate microspheres, Molecular Probes, Inc.) were coated overnight at 4 °C with purified GST-free disintegrin domains (0.3 mg/ml), washed with PBS, quenched for 1 h at 4 °C in fertilization medium containing 3% BSA, and resuspended by sonication with a water bath sonicator just before use. Zona pellucida-free eggs were incubated in 25-μl drops of 0.1% (v/v) coated beads in 3% BSA in fertilization medium under mineral oil for 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Eggs were then washed three times with fertilization medium, fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde, and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad, MRC 1024). To confirm that beads were coated with equal amounts of recombinant protein, aliquots of coated beads were boiled in Laemmli SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. Zona pellucida-free eggs were preincubated with GST fusion proteins in 100-μl drops of fertilization medium under mineral oil for 30 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The concentration of GST elution buffer (100 mm Tris, 5 mm reduced glutathione) was adjusted to 10% (v/v) final concentration. Sperm was then added into the drops (2.5 × 105 sperm/ml final concentration) and incubated for 1 h. Eggs were washed by removing medium from the drop and adding fresh Flushing and Holding medium three times. Finally eggs were fixed by adding glutaraldehyde to the drops to a final concentration of 0.5%. The number of spermatozoa bound to each egg was counted immediately under a microscope. Aliquots of the GST fusion proteins used were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and stained with Ponceau S to confirm the amount and the quality of recombinant proteins at the end of the incubation. Control in vitro fertilization was routinely performed at ∼50 × 106 sperm/ml to ascertain the quality of gametes and to verify that more than 90% of the eggs could be fertilized. Human ADAM15 is the only ADAM with the RGD motif within the putative integrin-binding sites of disintegrin domains (Fig. 1 a). We have reported that αvβ3 and α9β1 recognize the ADAM15 disintegrin domain in an RGD-dependent and an RGD-independent manner, respectively (17Eto K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Sheppard D. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Zhang X.P. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34922-34930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To identify how different integrins recognize the ADAM15 disintegrin domain, we introduced mutations around the RGD motif. The mutant ADAM15 disintegrin domains were synthesized in bacteria as GST fusion proteins. The ability of the mutant disintegrin domains to bind to αvβ3 and α9β1 was determined in cell adhesion assays with CHO cells expressing recombinant αvβ3or α9β1 (designated β3-CHO cells and α9-CHO cells, respectively). CHO cells transfected with expression vector (designated mock-CHO cells) were used as controls. CHO cells express endogenous αvβ1, αvβ5, and α5β1 (30Takagi J. Kamata T. Meredith J. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19794-19800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), but these integrins do not bind to ADAM15 (16Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7345-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 b shows that mutating the RGD motif to SGA completely blocked the binding of αvβ3 but had no detectable effect on the binding of α9β1 to the ADAM15 disintegrin domain, consistent with the previous report (17Eto K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Sheppard D. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Zhang X.P. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34922-34930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We found that the R481A, C487A, D488A, L489A, E491, and F492A mutations negatively affected adhesion of α9-CHO cells to the ADAM15 disintegrin domain (Fig. 1, c and d). In contrast, the same mutations flanking the RGD motif did not significantly affect adhesion of β3-CHO cells to the ADAM15 disintegrin domain (Fig. 1, e and f). Mutating the Asp488 and Glu491 simultaneously did not further affect the adhesion of α9- or β3-CHO cells to the ADAM15 disintegrin domain (Fig. 1,d and f). Altogether these results show that the αvβ3-ADAM15 interaction requires the RGD motif but not the surrounding residues. Thus, αvβ3 and α9β1recognize ADAM15 in distinct manners. Interestingly the residues critical for α9β1 binding in the disintegrin domain, including Asp488, have also been identified as critical for sperm-egg binding in ADAM2 and 3 (24Bigler D. Takahashi Y. Chen M.S. Almeida E.A. Osbourne L. White J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11576-11584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Zhu X. Bansal N.P. Evans J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7677-7683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26Takahashi Y. Bigler D. Ito Y. White J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The sperm-egg binding studies were performed without reference to any specific integrin, but the results are compatible with α9β1 being the oocyte receptor. The α9β1 binding motif in ADAM15 is conserved in many ADAMs. The alignment of the sequences of the putative integrin-binding regions of several ADAM disintegrin domains is shown in Fig. 2 a. The Arg481, Asp488, Leu489, Pro490, Glu491, and Phe492 residues that are critical for α9β1 binding in ADAM15 (designated the R X6DLPEF motif) are conserved among the disintegrin domains of all mammalian ADAMs except for ADAM10, which has the sequence R X5AREGI, and ADAM17, which has the sequence Q X7KGVSY, in this region. We thus hypothesized that α9β1 is a common receptor for many, if not all, ADAM disintegrin domains with this motif. To address this hypothesis, we tested the disintegrin domains of several ADAMs for interaction with α9β1 in cell attachment assays (Fig. 2,b and c). We found that α9-CHO cells adhered to the disintegrin domains from ADAM1, 2, 3, and 9 as well as 15 used as a positive control. α9-CHO cells do not spread very well on these disintegrins. The α9-CHO cells did not significantly adhere to the disintegrin domains from ADAM10 or 17. Control mock-transfected CHO cells did not significantly adhere to any of the ADAMs tested. We further found that adhesion of α9-CHO cells to the ADAMs was completely blocked by anti-α9 monoclonal antibody Y9A2 (data not shown), showing that the adhesion was α9-specific. These results indicate that α9β1 may be a common receptor for ADAM disintegrin domains with the R X6DLPEF-like motif. Since α6β1 has been implicated in ADAM2 and ADAM3 binding (26Takahashi Y. Bigler D. Ito Y. White J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we tested whether α6β1expressed in CHO cells bound to the ADAM2 and 3 disintegrin domains. We found that α6β1 did not mediate adhesion of α6-CHO cells to ADAM2 and 3 under the conditions in which α9-CHO cells adhered to these ligands (data not shown). Several residues in the putative integrin-binding region of ADAM1, 2, and 3 have been identified as critical for sperm-egg binding (24Bigler D. Takahashi Y. Chen M.S. Almeida E.A. Osbourne L. White J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11576-11584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Zhu X. Bansal N.P. Evans J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7677-7683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26Takahashi Y. Bigler D. Ito Y. White J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), but it has not been established which receptor(s) may be involved. Since ADAM1, 2, and 3 disintegrins bind avidly to α9β1, we wanted to test whether the binding of sperm to the oocyte may have a specificity similar to disintegrin binding to α9β1. To address this hypothesis, we first studied whether the recombinant ADAM disintegrin domains interact with oocytes. Although ADAM15 and 17 have not been shown to be present on sperm, they were used to test specificity. We tested whether fluorescent beads coated with disintegrin domains of ADAM2, 15, and 17 bind to zona pellucida-free eggs. As GST alone binds to such eggs (24Bigler D. Takahashi Y. Chen M.S. Almeida E.A. Osbourne L. White J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11576-11584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the GST portion of the recombinant fusion proteins was cleaved off, and the recombinant GST-free disintegrin domains were purified prior to coating of the beads. Fig. 3 shows that the beads coated with the ADAM15 disintegrin domain bound efficiently to the oocytes, the binding being largely concentrated to the microvillar region of the egg (Fig. 3 b, inset). ADAM2 disintegrin domain-coated beads also bound to the egg microvillar region (Fig. 3 a) but to a lesser extent than ADAM15-coated beads. Beads coated with the ADAM17 disintegrin domain (Fig. 3 c) and BSA-coated beads (not shown) did not bind to eggs. We next tested whether recombinant disintegrin domains, used as GST fusion proteins, would inhibit the binding of sperm to oocytes. The disintegrin domains from ADAM2 and ADAM15 inhibited the binding of sperm to mouse eggs in a dose-dependent manner, whereas that from ADAM17 did not affect sperm-egg binding (Fig. 4). The ADAM15 disintegrin domain was a more potent inhibitor than the ADAM2 disintegrin domain, blocking sperm-egg binding completely at 3 μm. Consistent with previous reports, the ADAM2 disintegrin domain at 3 μminhibited sperm-egg binding to about 50%. Altogether, these results indicate that the binding specificity of sperm for the oocyte is similar to that of ADAM disintegrin for integrin α9β1. We have shown here that the conserved R X6DLPEF motif flanking the RGD motif in the ADAM15 disintegrin domain, but not the RGD motif itself, is important for binding of ADAM15 to α9β1. The ADAM disintegrin domains with this motif, e.g. those of ADAM1, 2, 3, 9, 12, and 15, bind avidly to α9β1, but those lacking this motif, ADAM10 and 17, do not. The R X6DLPEF motif is conserved among all ADAM disintegrin domains except ADAM10 and 17 (Fig. 2 a), suggesting that α9β1 is a receptor for all ADAMs with this recognition motif and that binding of ADAM disintegrin domains to α9β1 through this motif may have critical biological functions. ADAM10 and 17 represent a subfamily within the ADAM family with several distinct structural (and functional) features. The disintegrin domains of ADAM10 and 17 contain only 13 of the 15 cysteine residues characteristic of a typical type III snake venom disintegrin domain, indicating that the disintegrin function of ADAM10 and 17 may be different from those of ADAMs with the conserved R X6DLPEF motif as well as from that of snake venom disintegrins and may not bind to any integrin at all. The RGD motif is not important for α9β1binding to ADAM15. Thus, α9β1 recognizes ADAM15 in a manner distinct from that of αvβ3. Human ADAM15 is the only ADAM with the RGD motif in the disintegrin domain, and the RGD motif is not conserved among ADAM disintegrin domains (even mouse ADAM15 does not have this motif), suggesting that RGD-dependent interaction of ADAM15 with integrins may have only limited importance. This is in stark contrast to many snake venom disintegrins in which the RGD motif is highly conserved. Snake venom disintegrins bind to αIIbβ3 or αvβ3integrins and block thrombosis and hemostasis (for reviews, see Refs. 2Wolfsberg T.G. Straight P.D. Gerena R.L. Huovila A.P. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholarand 31McLane M.A. Marcinkiewicz C. Vijay-Kumar S. Wierzbicka-Patynowski I. Niewiarowski S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 219: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of the snake venom disintegrins echistatin (Protein Data Bank code 2ECH) and kistrin (1KST) are available. The “disintegrin loops” of echistatin and kistrin are protruding loops (approximately 15 Å long and 4 Å wide) with the RGD motif at the tip of the loops. The three-dimensional structure of the ADAM disintegrin is not available. We generated a molecular model of the “disintegrin loop region” of the ADAM15 disintegrin domain based on the echistatin structure (2ECH) using the SWISS-MODEL protein modeling server (Fig. 5) assuming that the ADAM disintegrin and snake venom disintegrins are similar in structure. In this model oppositely charged residues (Arg481 and Glu491, Arg484 and Asp488) and hydrophobic residues (Pro482 and Pro490) are close to each other, stabilizing the loop. This model predicts that the Arg481 and the DLPEF motif in the α9β1 binding motif are located on the opposite side of the loop and that Arg481 and Glu491 are close to each other in space, although they are distant from each other in the primary structure. The RGD motif is present at the tip of the loop. It is likely that the entire loop sequence may be required for synthetic peptides of the ADAM disintegrins to be properly folded and effectively bind to α9β1. α9β1 has been shown to mediate cell adhesion and migration but not cell spreading in vitro. The association of an adhesion receptor, such as α9β1, with a metalloprotease, such as an ADAM, would be expected to facilitate cell migration in vivo in that the protease may digest and modify extracellular matrices and other tissue barriers in the immediate area of adhesion. The association between α9β1 and ADAM would further be expected to occur between molecules on the same cell,i.e. in cis, as cell-cell interaction is not normally a feature of cell migration. In contrast, it has been proposed that shedding of growth factors occurs with the growth factor and ADAM expressed on different cells, i.e. in trans. ADAM9 is responsible for processing of heparin-binding EGF (15Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) and binds with high affinity to integrin α9β1 (the present report). It will be interesting to know whether integrin α9β1 is involved in the processing of heparin-binding EGF. Our identification of mutations that obliterate the binding of α9β1 to ADAMs can now be used to test the role of α9β1-ADAM binding on cell migration as well as on processing of heparin-binding EGF and other potential ADAM substrates. As the prominent sheddases ADAM10 and 17 do not bind to α9β1, it is unlikely that α9β1 is involved in the processing of the proteins they target, including tumor necrosis factor-α and the Alzheimer precursor protein. Few ADAMs other than ADAM10 and 17 have been tested for capacity to process these proteins. It is possible that the specificities of the ADAM domains other than the metalloprotease domains and the cell type-specific expression of ADAM ligands, such as integrin α9β1, will determine which proteins will be digested and when. The digestion may then occur either in cis or in trans depending on the situation. The metalloprotease domains themselves may be rather nonspecific. The relative nonspecificity of metalloproteases agrees with the lack of success in developing specific metalloprotease inhibitors despite a large effort in this area by the pharmaceutical companies. As many ADAMs that have the R X6DLPEF motif are present on sperm (5Almeida E.A. Huovila A.P. Sutherland A.E. Stephens L.E. Calarco P.G. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Sonnenberg A. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1095-1104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) and ADAMs have been implicated in sperm-egg binding during fertilization, we tested whether α9β1-ADAM interaction may be involved in sperm-egg binding. Two recent studies demonstrate that the presence of acidic residues surrounding the cysteine in the disintegrin loop of ADAM2 (X(C/D)ECD) is essential for the binding of ADAM2 to the egg plasma membrane (24Bigler D. Takahashi Y. Chen M.S. Almeida E.A. Osbourne L. White J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11576-11584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Zhu X. Bansal N.P. Evans J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7677-7683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The underlined residues correspond to the RGD sequence in ADAM15. ADAM3, which also plays a role in sperm-egg binding, has the same characteristics in the sequence of its disintegrin loop (KSDCD). It has also been reported that synthetic peptides of the ADAM2 and 3 disintegrin domain putative integrin-binding site block sperm-egg interaction (5Almeida E.A. Huovila A.P. Sutherland A.E.

Cell. 2001; 12: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is intriguing that the R X6DLPEF α9β1 recognition motif is overlapping with these peptide sequences. All studies to date show that the Asp residue is essential. This residue is not conserved in ADAM10 and 17. We have shown here that the disintegrin domains of ADAM2 and 15, which effectively bind to integrin α9β1, bound to murine oocytes and blocked sperm-egg binding, but the ADAM17 disintegrin domain, which does not bind to α9β1, did not. Although ADAM15 has not been shown to be present on sperm, it shares the specificity with the sperm ADAM2; in fact, in our experiments, ADAM15 was more effective in egg binding and inhibition of sperm-egg binding that ADAM2, although these differences may be primarily technical. These binding studies suggest that the receptor for sperm on the oocytes is similar in specificity to α9β1. These results are well explained if eggs express integrin α9β1 on their surface. Although we confirmed the expression of α9β1 in many mouse tissues (32Palmer E.L. Ruegg C. Ferrando R. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 33Wang A. Patrone L. McDonald J.A. Sheppard D. Dev.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), our efforts to identify α9 on oocytes, using immunostaining in mouse ovary with anti-α9 cytoplasmic peptide antibody 1057 or in guinea pig ovary with either antibody 1057 or monoclonal antibody Y9A2, were not successful. The lack of detection of α9 in the ovary suggests that either α9 is not present or it is not accessible to antibodies. Another integrin(s) or other receptor with specificity similar to α9β1 may exist in eggs. It has been proposed that α6β1 is the oocyte receptor for sperm (5Almeida E.A. Huovila A.P. Sutherland A.E.

Recent findings that sperm-egg interaction is normal in α6-null mice (27Miller B.J. Georges-Labouesse E. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and that the antibody to α6, GoH3, does not always affect sperm-egg interaction (28Evans J.P. Kopf G.S. Schultz R.M. Dev.

Biosci. 1999; 4: D114-D131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have raised questions about the role of α6β1 in sperm-egg binding and fusion. We thus tested the ability of α6β1 to bind to the ADAM disintegrin domains. We did not detect adhesion of α6-expressing CHO cells to the ADAM disintegrins under the conditions in which α9-CHO cells adhere to the same ligands. However, it cannot be ruled out that α6β1 may interact with the ADAM disintegrin domains under certain conditions in oocytes. Since we used CHO cells expressing human α9 or α6/hamster β1 hybrid in this study, it also cannot be ruled out that human and hamster β1 provide different ligand specificities. The biological significance of the interaction between ADAMs and α9β1 integrin is not known. α9β1 is present in many developing and mature tissues including airway epithelia, the basal layer of squamous epithelia, smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, hepatocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes (32Palmer E.L.

Considering the wide distribution of both ADAMs and α9β1, ADAM-α9β1 interactions may play a role in many physiological and pathological situations including muscle development and regeneration; vascular, cartilage, and other tissue remodeling; and perhaps fertilization. It remains a challenge to determine what this role may be."
https://openalex.org/W2024974737,"Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) constitute a recently characterized family of pattern-recognition molecules that are conserved from insects to humans and are implicated in mammalian innate immunity. Here we report the isolation, characterization, cDNA cloning, and antimicrobial activities of a bovine PGRP ortholog termed bovine oligosaccharide-binding protein (bOBP). Milligram quantities of bOBP were purified from peripheral leukocytes, thus allowing for the characterization of the disulfide array and for determining the in vitro antimicrobial activities of the native protein. Of the tissues analyzed, bOBP mRNA was detected only in bone marrow where the protein is synthesized as a 190 amino acid precursor. The mature 169 amino acid protein is stored in the cytoplasmic granules of neutrophils and eosinophils but is absent from lymphocytes, monocytes, and platelets. bOBP was microbicidal for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and yeast at low micromolar concentrations. The finding that bOBP was microbicidal for organisms in which peptidoglycan is absent (Cryptococcus neoformans) or buried (Salmonella typhimurium) indicates that previous conclusions about the specificity of peptidoglycan recognition proteins must be reevaluated and suggests that other envelope components may mediate the antimicrobial action of PGRP family members."

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). These membrane proteins transmit signals from extracellular ligands to intracellular biological pathways via heterotrimeric G-proteins and have been a major class of therapeutic targets for a wide variety of human diseases (14Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). As such, characterizing the mechanism of biological recognition between these receptors and their ligands is essential for understanding the physiological or pathological processes that they mediate and devising novel strategies for clinical intervention. For CXCR4, studies have been carried out by a number of laboratories using chimeric chemokine receptors and site-specific mutants to study multiple domains of CXCR4 that are important for interacting with chemokine ligands and HIV-1 (15Picard L.

However, because there is no high resolution crystal structure available for CXCR4 (or any other chemokine receptor) alone or complexed with ligands, the structural and biochemical basis of ligand binding and signaling through these important membrane receptors remains poorly understood.To further define the structure-function relationship of the chemokine receptor-ligand interaction, theoretical computer modeling and site-directed mutagenesis were combined to predict plausible structural models for chemokine receptors and their complexes with ligands, such as interleukin-8 receptor β (24Luo Z. Butcher D. Huang Z. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and CCR5 (25Zhou N. Luo Z. Hall J.W. Luo J. Han X. Huang Z. Eur. J.

As to chemokines SDF-1α and vMIP-II, which recognize CXCR4, a large number of synthetic mutants and peptide analogs of SDF-1α were used to analyze the structure-activity relationship of different regions of SDF-1α in CXCR4 binding (30Crump M.P.

Commun. 1999; 264: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).For vMIP-II, we recently found that a synthetic 21-residue peptide derived from the N terminus of vMIP-II, designated as V1, is a potent antagonist of CXCR4 and inhibits HIV-1 replication in CXCR4+ T-cell lines (35Zhou N. Luo Z. Luo J. Hall J.W. Huang Z. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3782-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 36Luo Z. Fan X. Zhou N. Hiraoka M. Luo J. Kaji H. Huang Z. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13545-13550Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Being highly amenable to chemical synthesis and modification, this V1 peptide prompted us to use chemically modified analogs of V1 as probes to study the molecular recognition of CXCR4-ligand complex. Because one important aspect of receptor-ligand interaction is the requirement of stereospecificity, we report here the synthesis and structure-function characterization of all-d-amino acid analogs of V1 peptide, designated DV1 peptides. Unexpectedly, these d-peptides display strong binding and antagonistic activity toward CXCR4, thus revealing that the peptide binding site on CXCR4 is tolerant of changes in chirality of ligands. Similar observations are also made for otherd-peptides derived from the N terminus of SDF-1α. These findings have important implications for understanding the mechanism of CXCR4-ligand interaction and designing novel inhibitory molecules. Furthermore, DV1 peptides are highly resistant to proteolytic degradation and show significant activity in blocking HIV-1 replication in CXCR4+ cell lines, thus demonstrating their advantage over natural l-peptides for potential clinical application.DISCUSSIONCXCR4 plays an essential role in many physiological functions as the receptor for chemokines such as SDF-1α. In addition, CXCR4 is involved in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection by serving as the co-receptor for the cellular entry of T and dual tropic virus strains. CXCR4 belongs to the GPCR superfamily, which contains a large number of membrane proteins that are important therapeutic targets but whose structures and interactions with their ligands need to be further elucidated. In this study, we explored the mechanism of CXCR4-ligand recognition with synthetic chemokine-derived peptides containingd-amino acids in an attempt to gain insights into the structure and function of CXCR4 and design novel inhibitors of HIV-1 entry. Through structure and function analyses of a series ofd-peptides, d- and l-hybrid peptides, and mutant analogs derived from vMIP-II and SDF-1α, we found that the CXCR4 binding surface is tolerant of changes in peptide stereochemistry. These peptides containing some or alld-amino acids display significantly different topologies on side chains from l-counterparts and yet retain or even enhance their highly specific interactions with the receptor. This seems to be contrary to the notion that, in general, receptor-ligand interface is highly sensitive to changes in stereo configurations of ligands.ALX40–4C, a peptide of nine d-Arg residues, is known to bind CXCR4 (45Doranz B.J. Grovit-Ferbas K. Sharron M.P. Mao S.H. Goetz M.B. Daar E.S. Doms R.W. O'Brien W.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1395-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). However, this peptide, like other highly positively charged molecules such as T-22 (46Murakami T. Nakajima T. Koyanagi Y. Tachibana K. Fujii N. Tamamura H. Yoshida N. Waki M. Matsumoto A. Yoshie O. Kishimoto T. Yamamoto N. Nagasawa T. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1389-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and AMD3100 (47Schols D. Struyf S. van Damme J. Este J.A. Henson G. De Clercq E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), most likely acts through overall charge-charge electrostatic interactions (48Dealwis C. Fernandez E.J. Thompson D.A. Simon R.J. Siani M.A. Lolis E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6941-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This is different from the d- and l-peptides reported here for which specific interactions of uncharged hydrophobic side chains of the peptides with the receptor are clearly important.d-Peptides of same l-peptide sequences such as DV1 described here are different from d-peptides of reversed l-peptide sequences or so-called “retro-inverso” peptides. Retro-inverso peptides can have the identical side chain topology but opposite main chain direction as compared with l-counterparts (49Chorev M. Goodman M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 266-273Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In contrast,d-peptides such as DV1 retain the same main chain direction but adopt a distinct side chain topology (Fig. 2). Normally, such a change in the stereochemistry of side chains should disrupt a stereospecific ligand-receptor interface. There are only a limited number of cases reported in the literature where both d- and l-peptide enantiomers recognize the same receptors, such as l- and d-peptide ligands for calmodulin (50Fisher P.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11999-12002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge of current literature, CXCR4 binding by d- and l-peptide ligands derived from natural chemokines as reported here is unprecedented for chemokine receptors and membrane proteins of the GPCR family. Whether this is a unique property of CXCR4 or a similar phenomenon can be found in other chemokine receptors or GPCRs remains to be seen.Our results provide surprising new insights into the biochemical nature of the CXCR4 binding surface and should prompt further studies of the mechanism for the sterical tolerance of CXCR4-peptide interactions. More studies are needed to characterize the detailed binding sites ofd- and l-peptides on the receptor and structural basis of d-peptide binding. Such studies include site-directed mutations of potential receptor residues involved in the binding of these peptide ligands and molecular modeling of peptide-CXCR4 interaction using the recently proposed models of CXCR4 structure (27Chabot D.J. Chen H. Dimitrov D.S. Broder C.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4404-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 28Zhou N. Luo Z. Luo J. Liu D. Hall J.W. Pomerantz R.J. Huang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42826-42833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition, it will be important to extend this present study of d-peptides to modifications of full-length chemokine proteins and examine the structure-function relationship of their interactions with the receptor. We are currently exploring these and other related issues. Finally, it is of interest to examine whether the observation reported here may have any implication for understanding CXCR4 interaction with HIV-1. One may speculate that the flexibility of the CXCR4-ligand interface might be a feature of CXCR4 that HIV-1 capitalizes on. This might allow sequence and/or conformational variation to occur in the V3 loop, one of the gp120 components thought to interact with CXCR4. If the resulting changes in the gp120 V3 loop are accommodated by the flexible binding surface of CXCR4 but not that of an antibody, the virus can then evade neutralizing antibodies although maintaining a high affinity for the coreceptor that is necessary for viral entry into the cell. These hypotheses as raised by the present study merit further investigations.The understanding of the mechanism and structural basis for the remarkable property of the CXCR4 binding surface described here will have important implications for the design of novel ligands. Receptors and proteins mediating the HIV-1 entry process have become important targets for drug discovery, as agents blocking the virus from entering cells will serve as a new type of therapeutic that augments the arsenal of current drugs targeting the replication of the virus inside the cell. Small molecule inhibitors of HIV-1 entry via two principal co-receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 have been reported (32Heveker N. Montes M. Germeroth L. Amara A. Trautmann A. Alizon M. Schneider-Mergener J.

In addition, HIV-1 entry inhibitors have also been developed to target the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp41 (56Sodroski J.G. Cell. 1999; 99: 243-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this study, by taking advantage of the stability of unnatural d-amino acids, DV1 peptide shows significant anti-HIV-1 activity in biological conditions and thus may be a desirable lead for potential therapeutic development. As shown by this d-peptide, the apparent lack of stereospecificity of the CXCR4 binding surface as observed here might be exploited for the design of other highly stable and potent ligand molecules with novel topological features. The chemokine receptor CXCR4 is critical for many biological functions, such as B-cell lymphopoiesis, regulation of neuronal cell migration, and vascular development (1Nagasawa T. Hirota S.

The oligosaccharide structures of lipophosphoglycan varies among species, and epitopes of these species-specific oligosaccharides are suggested to be implicated in the interaction of Leishmania with macrophages as well as species-specific tissue tropism observed in leishmaniasis. The recognition of the species-specific variation of oligosaccharides is likely to be mediated by host carbohydrate-binding proteins, lectins, but the identities of the lectins remain elusive. Galectin-3 is a mammalian soluble β-galactoside-binding lectin and is expressed in macrophages, dendritic cells, and keratinocytes, as well as fibroblasts, all of which are present in the site of Leishmania infection. In this paper, we found that galectin-3 binds to lipophosphoglycan of Leishmania major but not to those of Leishmania donovani through L. major-specific polygalactose epitopes. Association of galectin-3 with L. major led to the cleavage of galectin-3, resulting in truncated galectin-3 containing the C-terminal lectin domain but lacking the N-terminal domain implicated in lectin oligomerization. This cleavage was inhibited by the galectin-3 antagonist lactose, as well as 1,10-ortho- phenanthroline, suggesting that galectin-3 is cleaved by zinc metalloproteases after its binding to lipophosphoglycans. The modulation of various innate immunity reactions by galectin-3 is affected by its oligomerization; therefore, we propose the L. major-specific truncation of galectin-3 may contribute to the species-specific immune responses induced by Leishmania.

Leishmaniasis is a tropical parasitic affliction affecting populations in Asia, Africa, South America, and southern Europe, and it is listed by the World Health Organization as one of the six most important parasitic diseases worldwide (1Berman J.D. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 24: 684-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Depending on the species of Leishmania, the disease manifests itself as visceral, mucosal (rarely), or cutaneous (1Berman J.D. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 24: 684-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 2Moody S.F. Acta Tropica. 1993; 53: 184-204Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the initial stages of infection, extracellular, flagellated Leishmania (called promastigotes) are transmitted to humans through the bite of sand flies. The promastigotes are engulfed by macrophages, where they differentiate to non-flagellated amastigotes and multiply (1Berman J.D. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 24: 684-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 3Bogdan C. Gessner A. Solbach W. Rollinghoff M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Among the several Leishmania species, Leishmania donovani infection results in a visceral form of the disease, such as hepatosplenomegaly and a very limited inflammatory response at the primary site of infection (1Berman J.D. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 24: 684-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). On the other hand, infection by Leishmania major develops in dermal tissues as cutaneous lesions (often non-lethal), with massive recruitment of leukocytes to the site of infection, suggesting that the cutaneous forms of the disease are correlated with a vigorous inflammatory response (1Berman J.D. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 24: 684-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the difference in the induction of initial immune responses between L. major and L. donovani is accounted for partly by variation in molecules expressed on the surface of these Leishmani a and by the interaction of such species-specific molecules with tissue macrophages or various cells present at the site of infection (2Moody S.F. Acta Tropica. 1993; 53: 184-204Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Two major molecules expressed on the surface of Leishmania are leishmanolysin (gp63) (5 × 105 molecules/cell) and lipophosphoglycan (LPG) 1The abbreviations used are: LPGlipophosphoglycanP-phosphorylatedMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightCBBCoomassie Brilliant BlueCRDcarbohydrate recognition domainDTTdithiothreitolPBSphosphate-buffered salineOPA1,10-ortho-phenanthrolineCAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid (1∼5 × 106 molecules/cell) (2Moody S.F. Acta Tropica. 1993; 53: 184-204Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Leishmanolysin is a highly conserved glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein and a member of the metzincin class zinc proteinase family, which includes mammalian matrix metalloproteases-2 and 9 (4Bouvier J.

In contrast to leishmanolysin, the structure of LPG varies dramatically among Leishmania species (7Ilg T. Etges R. Overath P. McConville M.J. Thomas-Oates J. Thomas J. Homans S.W. Ferguson M.A. J.

LPG consists of four domains (Fig. 1A), a small oligosaccharide cap structure, a repeating phosphorylated (P-) saccharide region, phosphosaccharide (P-saccharide) core, and a phosphatidylinositol anchor (2Moody S.F.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Structural analyses of LPG from several species of Leishmania reveal the variability of sequences in both the cap structure (Fig. 1A, see the structures of X) and the oligosaccharide substituents of the repeating P-saccharide units (Fig. 1A, see the structures of R) among species (2Moody S.F.

Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The species-specific epitopes of LPGs have been suggested to be implicated in the species specificity of Leishmania (12Turco S.J. Descoteaux A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 65-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Descoteaux A. Turco S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In particular, the L. major- specific epitopes, β-polygalactose residues (Galβ1–3)n on the repeating P-saccharide units have been implicated both in the adhesion of L. major to the midgut of its sand fly vector (14Pimenta P.F.

However, the receptor proteins that have affinity for the L. major-specific β-polygalactose epitope have not yet been well defined, as all macrophage receptors identified to date recognize common epitopes present on the surface of both L. major and L. donovani (18Kane M.M.

Up to 11 galectins (galectin-1–galectin-11) have been found in mammals, as well as many in other phyla including birds, amphibians, fish, nematodes, sponges, and fungi. Of particular interest with regard to L. major infection is galectin-3, which is expressed in and released from macrophages (22Cherayil B.J. Weiner S.J. Pillai S. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 1959-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 23Frigeri L., G. Liu F.-T. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 861-867PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sato S. Hughes R.C. J. Biol.

Med. 1993; 178: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), all of which are present in dermal tissues, the prime infection sites of Leishmania. This lectin binds β-galactoside-containing glycoconjugates, particularly those with a polylactosamine structure (27Sato S. Hughes R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6983-6990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sparrow C.P. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7383-7390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Galectin-3 is a soluble ∼30-kDa protein composed of two domains, a C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD, lectin domain) and an unique N-terminal domain containing multiple repeats of a sequence rich in glycine, proline, and tyrosine (19Hughes R.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 20Liu F.T. Clin. Immunol. 2000; 97: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 21Cooper D.N. Barondes S.H. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Upon binding to glycoconjugate ligands at the cell surface, galectin-3 molecules are able to oligomerize through their N-terminal multiple repeating domains (29Hsu D.K. Zuberi R.I. Liu F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14167-14174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,30Massa S.M. Cooper D.N. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of galectin-3 causes cross-linking of surface glycoproteins, leading to the stable association of galectin-3 to its receptors (19Hughes R.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 20Liu F.T. Clin. Immunol. 2000; 97: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 21Cooper D.N. Barondes S.H. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Such cross-linking is known to trigger signal transduction cascades that are involved in innate immune responses (19Hughes R.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 20Liu F.T. Clin. Immunol. 2000; 97: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 21Cooper D.N. Barondes S.H.

Another consequence of galectin-3-mediated cross-linking of galectin-3 ligands is cellular adhesion; galectin-3 cross-links cells expressing its ligands, therefore leading to cell-cell adhesion (32Woo H.-J. Shaw L.M. Messier J.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7097-7099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kuwabara I. Liu F.T. J.

Simard M. Rancourt A. Bergeron M.G. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1813-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been suggested that the persistent presence of galectin-3 on the cell surface of leukocytes through galectin-3 oligomerization results in the formation of multivalent surface galectin-3-glycoprotein lattices that have the potential to restrict the movement of certain receptors involved in immune responses (31Lowe J.B. Cell. 2001; 104: 809-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 36Sacchettini J.C. Baum L.G. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3009-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 37Demetriou M. Granovsky M. Quaggin S. Dennis J.W. Nature. 2001; 409: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that galectin-3 plays several roles in immune response. However, whether galectin-3 is implicated in immune response during leishmaniasis has not been investigated. Here, we demonstrate that galectin-3 can distinguish L. major from L. donovani by recognizing L. major-specific polygalactose epitopes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting that a host factor can distinguish between different species of Leishmania. The association of galectin-3 to L. major leads to the cleavage of galectin-3, and this Leishmania species-specific cleavage of cell-associated galectin-3 was also observed in L. major-infected macrophages. This truncated galectin-3 lacks the N-terminal domain crucial for galectin-3 oligomerization, which is prerequisite to the majority of galectin-3 activities. Thus, we propose that L. major-mediated formation of truncated galectin-3 may be one of the initial steps that initiate massive inflammatory responses at the early stage of L. major infection. Chemicals and other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless specified otherwise. Protease inhibitors were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.

Leishmania were used for experiments 7–8 days after passage. Hybridoma M3/38.1.2.8 and macrophage cell line J774A.1 were from American Tissue Culture Collection. Monoclonal antibodies against LPG (WIC79.3 and WIC108.3) were kindly provided by Dr. E. Handman (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Victoria, Australia). A monoclonal antibody against native leishmanolysin was from Cedarlane Laboratories (Ontario, Canada). A rat monoclonal antibody against galectin-3 (Mac-2) was purified from culture medium of the hybridoma M3/38.1.2.8. Polyclonal antibody against C-terminal CRD of galectin-3 was raised in our laboratory by injecting CRD, which was prepared by the method reported (30Massa S.M. Cooper D.N. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), to rabbits. Recombinant human galectin-3 was purified as described previously with modification (27Sato S. Hughes R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6983-6990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Sato S. Ouellet N. Pelletier I. Simard M. Rancourt A. Bergeron M.G. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1813-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Briefly, a clone of Escherichia coli JM109 containing an expression plasmid of human galectin-3 was used for purification. Two liters of overnight bacteria culture medium were incubated with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C to induce galectin-3 production. After sonicating bacteria in ∼50 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 mNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT (buffer A) together with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), cell homogenates were centrifuged to obtain a soluble fraction. The bacterial supernatants (∼50 ml) were applied to 5 ml of asialofetuin-agarose (4 mg of asialofetuin/ml of gel; AminoLink Plus gel from Pierce) and after extensive washing of column (∼20 bed volumes) with buffer A without EDTA and DTT, galectin-3 was eluted with lactose (100 mm in buffer A without EDTA and DTT). The eluate was first dialyzed against PBS with 1 mm EDTA and then against PBS to remove lactose. Typically, 3–7 mg of galectin-3 was purified from 2-liter cultures of E. coli. The purity of galectin-3 was determined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) and silver staining of a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Membrane components of Leishmania were extracted as previously described by Bouvier et al. (39Bouvier J. Schneider P. Etges R. Bordier C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10113-10119Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), with a modification. Briefly, Leishmania (∼3 × 109 cells, stationary phase) were washed with PBS and resuspended in 50 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) supplemented with 50 μm1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone. Cells were sonicated, and membrane-associated components were pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The pellets were resuspended in 23 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, and 2% Triton X-114, and the suspension was stirred at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation at 8,000 ×g for 15 min to obtain Triton X-114-soluble material, the membrane extract was fractionated by Triton X-114 phase separation. The detergent-rich fraction was collected and diluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) supplemented with Triton X-100 (the final concentration of Triton X-100 was 1%, and the concentration of Triton X-114 was below 0.35%). This detergent-rich fraction was passed through a DEAE-Macro-Prep column (Bio-Rad). LPG- and leishmanolysin-rich fractions from the column were collected and were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). To prepare the galectin-3-agarose gel, purified recombinant galectin-3 (2.4 mg) was incubated with 1 ml of AminoLink Plus coupling gel (Pierce) in 0.1m sodium phosphate and 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.2) for 4 h at 4 °C and coupled to the agarose gel according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Following equilibration in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100), 1 ml of the LPG- and leishmanolysin-rich fractions was applied to the galectin-3 column (1-ml bed volume) at 4 °C. The column was washed with 5 ml of buffer B, then was eluted first with 5 ml of 100 mm mannose in buffer B, followed by 100 mm lactose. The obtained fractions were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) using a Tris-glycine buffer system. After incubation with 5% skim milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20, membranes were incubated with anti-LPG antibodies (WIC79.3 or WIC108.3), followed by anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Membrane-bound antibody complexes were visualized by exposing to Blue XB-1 film (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) after incubation with a chemiluminescence substrate for peroxidase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Five μl of each fraction from galectin-3 affinity column chromatography were also dot-blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and the presence of leishmanolysin was detected with anti-native leishmanolysin antibody (Cedarlane). A mouse macrophage cell line, J774A.1, was plated at 2 × 105 cells/30-mm culture dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and antibiotics. Leishmania promastigotes were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium three times and added to a macrophage cell layer at the indicated macrophage: parasite ratio (1:5–1:20) in the presence or absence of lactose (50 mm). After 2 h at 37 °C, the media were collected and cell/parasite-free supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were subjected to Western blotting with anti-Mac-2 antibody to analyze the galectin-3 contents. To study the binding and cleavage of purified galectin-3 by Leishmania, the parasites (1 × 107) were incubated with recombinant galectin-3 (1.7 μm) in 250 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 25 mm Hepes:PBS (1:1 ratio) in the presence or absence of lactose (100 mm), at 4 °C for 30 min for the binding assay or at 37 °C with agitation (800 rpm/min) for the indicated time for the cleavage assay. After the incubation, parasite-free supernatants were obtained by spinning at 2,500 rpm for 7 min. The supernatants were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins in the gels were stained by CBB staining. Alternatively, fractionated proteins on the SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to the nitrocellulose filters and the galectin-3-related fragments were detected by anti-galectin-3 antibodies (anti-Mac-2 antibody or anti-CRD antibody). When parasites were incubated with 100 mm sugar, the concentration of NaCl in PBS was manipulated to maintain appropriate osomolarity, i.e. 317 mosmol/liter. To inhibit cleavage, various protease inhibitors were added at the concentration ranging from that recommended by the manufacture to 10 times higher. The final concentrations of ethanol or Me2SO (used to dissolve protease inhibitors) in the incubation mixtures were below 0.1%. The three fragments of galectin-3 (bands A–C) were generated by incubating recombinant galectin-3 with L. major as described above and purified using asialofetuin-agarose. The fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using CAPS buffer system as previously described (40Sato S. Burdett I. Hughes R.C. Exp. Cell. Res. 1993; 207: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Galectin fragments were located by staining with 0.5% Ponceau S solution. N-terminal protein sequencing of galectin-3 fragments was performed on a model 473A Applied Biosystems Sequencer by Eastern Quebec Proteomics Center (CRCHUL, Québec, Canada). MALDI-TOF was performed using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Voyager-DE-Pro, PerSeptive Biosystems) by Eastern Quebec Proteomic Center. Molecular masses of galectin-3 fragments were assigned based on an external mass calibration using a standard molecular marker set provided by CRCHUL. Peritoneal thioglycollate macrophages were prepared as previously described (24Sato S. Hughes R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4424-4430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One million of thioglycollate-induced peritoneal inflammatory macrophages were first incubated with galectin-3 (2 μm, 0.3 ml) in RPMI 1640 medium for 10 min. After washing to remove unbound galectin-3, macrophages were incubated with L. major or L. donovani (1 × 107) for 2 h at 37 °C. After incubation, extracellular galectin-3 was detected by anti-Mac-2 antibody or anti-CRD antibody. LPG, a major surface glycoconjugate of Leishmania, contains various β-galactoside structures (Fig. 1A, gray boxes) (7Ilg T. Etges R. Overath P. McConville M.J. Thomas-Oates J. Thomas J. Homans S.W.

Chem. 1993; 268: 18457-18466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first investigated whether galectin-3 has any affinity toward LPG from L. major and L. donovani. Membrane-integrated molecules, including glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored molecules such as leishmanolysin and LPG, were extracted from L. major LV39 and L. donovani and applied to galectin-3-agarose affinity columns at 4 °C. After extensive washing of the column, molecules associated with the galectin-3-agarose columns were first eluted with mannose, a non-antagonist of galectin-3, followed by lactose, an antagonist of galectin-3, to elute glycoconjugates that have affinity for galectin-3. The presence of leishmanolysin and LPG-related glycoconjugates in those fractions was analyzed by Western blotting with an antibody against leishmanolysin and two monoclonal antibodies against (lipo)phosphoglycan (WIC108.3 and WIC79.3), respectively. The majority of leishmanolysin from both L. major and L. donovani was found in the unbound (flow-through) fractions, and we could not detect any significant amount of leishmanolysin in the fractions eluted with mannose or with lactose (data not shown), indicating that leishmanolysin does not bind to galectin-3. These data are consistent with previous reports suggesting that leishmanolysin contains N-linked high mannose type oligosaccharides (41Funk V.A. Thomas-Oates J.E. Kielland S.L. Bates P.A. Olafson R.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which does not have affinity for galectin-3. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 1B, significant proportion of L. major LPG-related glycoconjugates detected by WIC108.3 was found in the fractions eluted with lactose, an antagonist for galectin-3, but not in the fractions eluted with mannose. Thus, the data indicate that galectin-3 specifically binds LPG-related glycoconjugates of L. major. Some of LPG in the fractions eluted with lactose were also WIC79.3-positive (Fig. 1C). Unlike WIC108.3, which binds the common phosphoglycan structure of LPG of Leishmania, WIC79.3 binds to one of the L. major-specific polygalactose epitopes, (PO4-6(Galβ1–3)nGalβ1–4Manα1-) (Fig. 1A) (17Kelleher M. Bacic A. Handman E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 42Kelleher M. Curtis J.M. Sacks D.L. Handman E. Bacic A. Mol. Biochem.

A His-tagged version of MiaB has been overproduced and purified to homogeneity. Gel electrophoresis and size exclusion chromatography revealed that MiaB protein is a monomer. As isolated MiaB contains both iron and sulfide and an apoprotein form can chelate as much as 2.5–3 iron and 3–3.5 sulfur atoms per polypeptide chain. UV-visible and EPR spectroscopy of MiaB indicate the presence of a [4Fe-4S] cluster under reducing and anaerobic conditions, whereas [2Fe-2S] and [3Fe-4S] forms are generated under aerobic conditions. Preliminary site-directed mutagenesis studies suggest that Cys157, Cys161, and Cys164 are involved in iron chelation and that the cluster is essential for activity. Together with the previously shown requirement of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) for the methylthiolation reaction, the finding that MiaB is an iron-sulfur protein suggests that it belongs to a superfamily of enzymes that uses [Fe-S] centers and AdoMet to initiate radical catalysis.

MiaB is the first and only tRNA modification enzyme known to contain an Fe-S cluster. The chemistry of the biological reactions leading to the synthesis of sulfur-containing biomolecules remains largely unknown. However, this research field has recently received renewed attention with the study of the enzymology of important metabolic pathways such as those leading to iron-sulfur clusters, biotin, molybdopterin, thiamin, and isopenicillin (1.Mühlenhoff U.

Conversion of uridine to 4-thiouridine by ThiI protein is one of such sulfur atom insertion reactions into tRNAs (6.Mueller E.G. Palenchar P.M. Buck C.C. J. Biol.

Another tRNA modification leading to 2-methylthio-N-6-isopentenyl adenosine (ms2i6A-37) 1The abbreviations used are: ms2i6A-372-methylthio-N-6-isopentenyl adenosine 37AdoMetS-adenosylmethioninei6A-37N-6-isopentenyl adenosine 37Ni-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidMIABHMiaB with a His6 tag at the N terminusHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyrequires a chemically difficult aromatic C–H to C–S bond conversion, which has not been investigated yet. ms2i6A-37 is found at position 37 next to the anticodon on the 3′-position in almost all eukaryotic and bacterial tRNAs that read codons beginning with U except tRNAI,V Ser (7.Grosjean H. Nicoghosian K. Haumont E. Söll D. Cedergeron R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 5697-5706Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The postulated pathway for the synthesis of ms2i6A-37 and the genes involved are as indicated in Fig. 1 (8.Björk G.R. Hatfiekd D.L. Lee B.J. Pirtle R.M. Transfer in Protein Synthesis.

The second step, which requires iron, cysteine, and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), consists of both sulfur insertion and methylation at position 2 of the base moiety, but it is still unknown whether each step is catalyzed by a specific or by the same enzyme (14.Rosenberg A.H. Gefter M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 581-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15.Gefter M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

On the other hand tRNAs from mutant strains lacking a functional miaB gene have been shown to contain only i6A-37, the product of the first step of the pathway suggesting that the MiaB protein is involved in C–S bond formation (17.Esberg B. Leung E.H.-C. Tsui H.-C. T. Björk G.R. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7256-7265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deficiency in methylthiolation leads to a decreased efficiency of the corresponding tRNAs and an increased spontaneous mutation frequency (18.Connolly D.M. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3233-3246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Connolly D.M. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1711-1721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To gain insight into the mechanisms for sulfur atom insertion into biological molecules in general, we have focused our interest on the product of the miaB gene, which has been recently cloned (17.Esberg B. Leung E.H.-C. Tsui H.-C. T. Björk G.R. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7256-7265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the first characterization of a purified MiaB protein and demonstrate that it is an iron-sulfur protein. MiaB is the first Fe-S enzyme shown to participate in tRNA modification. All DNA manipulations were as described previously (20.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1998: 1-2.14.8Google Scholar). Enzymes, oligonucleotides, and culture media were purchased from Invitrogen. T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, and the Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification kit were from Promega, Inc. Bacterial alkaline phosphatase and plasmid DNA purification kit FexiprepTM were from Amersham Biosciences. DNA fragments were extracted from agarose gel and purified with High Pure PCR Product Purification kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); DNA sequencing was performed by Genome Express (Grenoble, France). Ni-NTA Superflow was purchased from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). E. coli strain DH5α was used for cloning and plasmid propagation. E. colistrain TX3346 miaB− was used for the in vivo activity tests (17.Esberg B. Leung E.H.-C. Tsui H.-C. T. Björk G.R. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7256-7265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strain B834(DE3)pLysS was used for gene expression. Genomic DNA from E. coli DH5α was purified from 100 ml of culture grown in LB following a procedure recommended by the supplier. The MiaB-encoding gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using this genomic DNA as a template. The following primers were used: 5′-cgcaagagcaagcatATGaccaaaaaac-3′ (NdeI site underlined, ATG codon in uppercase) hybridized to the noncoding strand at the 5′ terminus of the gene and 5′-ggaaaaaggcgcaagctttgcaataaag-3′ (HindIII site underlined) hybridized to the coding strand ∼25 bp downstream of the transcription termination signal (17.Esberg B. Leung E.H.-C. Tsui H.-C. T. Björk G.R. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7256-7265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCRs were run on a Stratagene RoboCycler Gradient 40 machine as follows. Genomic DNA (2–4 μg) ofE. coli was denatured for 4 min at 94 °C in the presence of the primers (0.5 μm each). The PwoDNA polymerase (2 units) and deoxynucleotide mix (0.2 mmeach) were added, and 25 cycles (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C) were then performed followed by a 10-min elongation step at 72 °C. The PCR product was digested withNdeI and HindIII and cloned in pT7-7 digested with the same enzymes. The cloned gene was completely sequenced to verify that the PCR had not introduced any errors. The pT7-7-derived plasmid containing the whole miaBgene was named pT7-miaB. The hexahistidine linker sequence was introduced by using two oligonucleotides: His1 (5′-tatgcaccatcaccatcacca-3′), which anneals to the His2 (5′-tatggtgatggtgatggtgca-3′) and forms a cassette containing a 5′ and 3′ NdeI-digested site. The two primers were previously end-phosphorylated with ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase as recommended by the manufacturer. This cassette was ligated into pT7-MiaB digested with NdeI and dephosphorylated. The proper orientation of the His tag cassette was selected by PCR screening experiment and confirmed by sequencing the purified plasmid. A plasmid containing the correct insert was selected and sequenced. The clone used during this work was designated pT7-miaBH. Mutagenesis was carried out on plasmid pT7-miaBH with QuikChangeTMSite-Directed Mutagenesis kits from Stratagene according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pT7-miaBH plasmid was used to transform E. coli B834(DE3)pLysS, which was grown at 37 °C in Luria Broth supplemented with 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 35 mg/liter chloramphenicol. When A600 reached 0.4 the production of the MiaBH was induced by addition of 50 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the incubation was subsequently carried on overnight at 15 °C. Induction of protein overexpression in the culture was monitored by SDS-PAGE on portions of a 1-ml sample withdrawn at various times. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm at 10 °C, resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, and stored at −70 °C until use. The MiaBH protein was purified aerobically at 4 °C as follows. The frozen cells were thawed, broken by sonication, and centrifuged at 220,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The cell-free extract was loaded onto a 4- × 15-cm column of Ni-NTA Superflow previously equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 10 mm imidazole). The column was subsequently washed thoroughly with buffer A, and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of buffer B (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole). Fractions containing the protein were pooled and concentrated in an Amicon cell fitted with a YM30 (Spectrapor) membrane. The apo form of MiaBH protein was prepared as follows. Protein-bound iron was removed by chelation during reduction of the protein aerobically at 0 °C in the presence of 10 mm EDTA and 10 mm sodium dithionite in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8 buffer. The solution became colorless after a 1-h incubation, and then the solution was loaded onto a Sephadex G-25 column (P10) equilibrated and eluted with the same buffer. The apoMiaBH was then concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon 30 devices (Amicon). All steps of the reconstitution procedure were completed anaerobically inside a glove box containing less than 2 ppm O2. The apoprotein was incubated with an 8-fold excess of Na2S and FeCl3 in 2 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8 buffer containing 5 mmdithiothreitol for 3 h. After chromatography on a Sephadex G-25 column the dark brown fraction was collected and concentrated by using a YM30 Diaflo membrane. Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard (21.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). Iron was determined by the method of Fish (22.Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), and inorganic sulfide was quantified spectrophotometrically as described by Beinert (23.Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Modified nucleosides were analyzed from tRNAs isolated as described previously (18.Connolly D.M. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3233-3246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Buck M. Connick M. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 129: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). tRNAs were digested to nucleosides with nuclease P1 and alkaline phosphatase. The resulting hydrolysate was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) by the method of Gehrke and Kuo (26.Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. Journal of Chromatography Library. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1990: A3-A71Google Scholar). UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a Cary 1Bio (Varian) spectrophotometer. X-band EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Instruments ESP 300D spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR 900 flow cryostat (4.2–300 K). The samples used for EPR studies were reduced anaerobically by sodium dithionite (2 mm final concentration) in a glove box (<1 ppm O2). MiaBH protein is derived from MiaB by addition of a tag of six histidines at the N terminus. It was obtained from an E. coli overproducer and purified aerobically using a Ni-NTA column that specifically retains proteins containing cluster of histidines. The purity of the protein was checked by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The purified protein was analyzed by Edman degradation and gave the six histidines and first 10 amino acids of the N-terminal sequence of MiaB (17.Esberg B. Leung E.H.-C. Tsui H.-C. T. Björk G.R. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7256-7265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MiaBH behaves as a monomer with an apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa (Mr = 53,600 calculated from the amino acid sequence) during gel chromatography on Superdex200 by comparison with various molecular weight protein standards. The purified protein has a reddish-brown color in agreement with the light absorption spectrum in Fig. 3(spectrum 1), and the analysis for labile iron and sulfide suggested the presence of a protein-bound iron-sulfur cluster. However, iron content was substoichiometric with regard to MiaBH (0.7 mol/mol), and the protein contained sulfide in slight excess with regard to iron (1.0–1.2 mol/mol), probably as a consequence of loss of the cluster during purification. Consequently to find how much iron and sulfide can be chelated by MiaBH, the protein was converted to the apoprotein form (Fig. 3, spectrum 2) and then reconstituted with an 8-fold excess of ferrous iron and sodium sulfide under anaerobic conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After anaerobic desalting on a Sephadex G-25 column, MiaBH was then found to contain 2.5–3 iron and 3–3.5 sulfur atoms per polypeptide chain. The electronic absorption spectrum of the as isolated MiaBH (Fig. 3,spectrum 1) displays absorption bands at 330, 416, and 460 nm and a shoulder at around 560 nm, compatible with a [2Fe-2S]2+ center (27.Johnson M.K. King R.C. Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry. Wiley, Chichester, UK1994: 1896-1915Google Scholar). The spectrum of the reconstituted MiaBH protein is slightly different (Fig. 3, spectrum 3) and more consistent with a [4Fe-4S] cluster (27.Johnson M.K. King R.C. Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry. Wiley, Chichester, UK1994: 1896-1915Google Scholar). During anaerobic reduction of reconstituted MiaBH with a 10-fold molar excess of dithionite, a bleaching of the solution and a loss of the visible absorption bands were observed (data not shown). The protein was analyzed by EPR spectroscopy, both in the as isolated and reconstituted (Fig. 4) forms. In both cases it exhibited an isotropic EPR signal centered at g = 2.01 (Fig. 4, A1 and B1). The relaxation properties of this signal were characteristic for the S = 1/2 ground state of a [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster. This species accounted for 15–20% of total iron in the aerobically purified MiaBH protein (Fig. 4A1) but never exceeded 5% in the reconstituted sample (Fig. 4B1). Upon reduction by dithionite both samples gave rise to a new S = 1/2 species, characterized by an axial EPR signal with g values at 2.06 and 1.93, accounting for 40–50% of total iron. The signal became broader at 30 K and could not be detected anymore above 40 K. Such a temperature dependence of the EPR signal and its microwave power saturation properties (data not shown) are characteristic for the S = 1/2 ground state of [4Fe-4S]1+ clusters (28.Cammack R. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 38: 281-322Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the g value of the low field feature is more consistent with a [4Fe-4S]1+ rather than with a [2Fe-2S]1+cluster. Partially purified preparations of MiaB, with no His tag, proved to display spectroscopic properties similar to those of MiaBH (data not shown). The functionality of the MiaB protein was assayed in vivo using the miaB−TX3346 E. coli strain lacking an active miaB gene (17.Esberg B. Leung E.H.-C. Tsui H.-C. T. Björk G.R. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7256-7265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First this strain was transformed either with plasmid pT7-miaB or pT7-miaBH for expression of MiaB and MiaBH, respectively. A control experiment was carried out using the vector pT7-7 with no miaB gene insert. Then tRNAs from these strains were isolated, and their modified nucleoside content was analyzed by HPLC as described previously (26.Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. Journal of Chromatography Library. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1990: A3-A71Google Scholar). Whereas the tRNAs from the control strain showed an accumulation of i6A-37 with no evidence of ms2i6A-37 (Fig. 1), those from both MiaB-expressing strains showed the formation of ms2i6A-37 (Fig. 5B). These results demonstrated that the iron-sulfur protein MiaB (or MiaBH), product of the miaB gene, is functional during i6A-37 to ms2i6A-37 conversion. Whether the iron-sulfur cluster was required for activity was investigated by studying site-directed mutants in which the three conserved cysteines of the conserved Cys157-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Cys161-Xaa-Xaa-Cys164sequence have been changed to alanine. The above cysteine triad is the signature of a whole class of iron-sulfur proteins and provides the cysteines for iron chelation (29.Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetsler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Using the in vivo assay described above, we observed that the miaB−E. coli TX3346 strain transformed with pT7-miaBHC157A, pT7-miaBHC161A, and pT7-miaBHC164A, each expressing a different mutant MiaB with an alanine in place of cysteine in positions 157, 161, and 164 respectively, was unable to produce the ms2i6A-37 modified nucleoside (Fig. 5C). This provides a strong evidence that the cluster is required for activity. Further characterization of the mutants is in progress. The results presented here show that MiaB, the enzyme participating in the methylthiolation of the base moiety of adenosine in some tRNAs (17.Esberg B. Leung E.H.-C. Tsui H.-C. T. Björk G.R. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7256-7265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is a monomeric iron-sulfur protein. The type of iron-sulfur cluster in MiaB is not definitively identified here since MiaB seems to be able to assemble [4Fe-4S], [3Fe-4S], and [2Fe-2S] center forms as shown by UV-visible and EPR spectroscopy. Cluster lability is furthermore shown from the loss of iron and sulfide during purification. However, the present results indicate that, anaerobically, MiaB can assemble a [4Fe-4S] cluster with both 2+ and 1+ redox states. [3Fe-4S]1+ and [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters accumulated in aerated solutions of the protein indicating that the [4Fe-4S] cluster degrades into clusters of lower nuclearity under exposure to air. This transformation seems reversible since the latter can be converted back to a [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster upon anaerobic reduction. Whether oxygen sensitivity or cluster lability is responsible for incomplete cluster assembly in vitro remains unclear at this stage. Further experiments are required to optimize reconstitution procedures and to make conclusions as far as the iron content is concerned. The presence, in MiaB, of an oxygen-sensitive iron-sulfur cluster with such unique properties and of essential cysteines within a Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys sequence (Cys157, Cys161, and Cys164) as shown from activity assays reported here together with the requirement of AdoMet for the conversion of i6A-37 to ms2i6A-37 (15.Gefter M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 36: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that MiaB is a member of a superfamily of enzymes that utilize the combination of a labile Fe-S cluster and AdoMet to initiate radical catalysis (29.Sofia H.J.

Well studied members of this family are lysine aminomutase, biotin synthase, and the activating components of ribonucleotide reductase and pyruvate-formate lyase (25.Külser R. Pils T. Kappl R.

It is thus very likely that also in MiaB these cysteines play a similar role and that the MiaB iron center is essential for activity. We suggest that the methylthiolation reaction proceeds through radical activation of the tRNA substrate by a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical, which is generated by iron-catalyzed reduction of AdoMet. MiaB is the first characterized metalloenzyme and the first Fe-S protein involved in tRNA modification. It is thus very likely that the dramatic effects of iron starvation on ms2i6A-37 synthesis in E. coli cells are a consequence of the requirement of MiaB for iron (14.Rosenberg A.H. Gefter M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 581-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16.Agris P.F. Armstrong D.J. Schäfer K.P. Söll D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1975; 2: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The availability of pure MiaB now provides the opportunity to investigate whether one or two enzymes are required for i6A-37 conversion to ms2i6A-37. The MiaB protein catalyzes a C–H to C–S bond conversion. This type of reaction has been recently the subject of intense biochemical and spectroscopic investigations, and a complete understanding of the mechanisms used by enzymes such as biotin synthase or lipoic acid synthase is presently one of the most challenging and fascinating problems in bioinorganic chemistry. MiaB protein provides a new interesting tool to study the mechanistic and structural aspects of that reaction. We thank Mathilde Louwagie for amino acid sequencing.

https://openalex.org/W2031881900,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein induces transient growth arrest or apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress and mediates the irreversible growth arrest of cellular senescence. We present evidence here that p53 also contributes to the reversible, growth factor-dependent arrest of quiescence (G<sub>0</sub>). Microinjection of expression vectors encoding either MDM2 or a pRb-binding mutant of SV40 T antigen, both of which abrogate p53 function, stimulated quiescent normal human fibroblasts to initiate DNA synthesis and were 40–70% as effective as wild-type T antigen. Electrophoretic mobility shift and p53 transactivation assays showed that p53 activity was higher in quiescent and senescent cells compared with proliferating cells. As proliferating cells entered G<sub>0</sub> after growth factor withdrawal, the p53 mRNA level increased, followed by transient accumulation of the protein. Shortly thereafter, the expression (mRNA and protein) of p21, a p53 target gene and effector of cell cycle arrest, increased. Finally, stable expression of the HPV16 E6 oncogene or dominant negative p53 peptide, GSE-22, both of which inhibit p53 function, delayed entry into quiescence following growth factor withdrawal. Our data indicate that p53 is activated during both quiescence and senescence. They further suggest that p53 activity contributes, albeit not exclusively, to the quiescent growth arrest."
https://openalex.org/W1973813782,"The Ca2+ receptor, a member of the family 3 of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), responds not only to its primary physiological ligand Ca2+ but also to other di- and trivalent metals (Mg2+, Gd3+) and the organic polycations spermine and poly-l-Arginine. As has been found for other family 3 GPCRs, the large amino-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) of the Ca2+ receptor is the primary Ca2+ binding domain. To examine how the signal is propagated from the ECD to the seven-transmembrane core domain (7TM) we constructed a Ca2+receptor mutant (T903-Rhoc) lacking the entire ECD but containing the 7TM. We have found that this structure initiates signaling in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably expressing the construct. One or more cation recognition sites are also located within the 7TM. Not only Ca2+, but also several other Ca2+receptor-specific agonists, Mg2+, Gd3+, spermine, and poly-l-Arginine, can activate T903-Rhoc truncated receptor-initiated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in HEK 293 cells. The phenylalkylamine compound, NPS 568, identified as a positive allosteric modulator of the Ca2+ receptor can selectively potentiate the actions of Ca2+ and other polycationic agonists on the T903-Rhoc receptor. Similarly, organic polycations synergistically activate T903-Rhoc with di- and trivalent metals. Alanine substitution of all the acidic residues in the second extracellular loop of the T903-Rhoc receptor significantly impairs activation by metal ions and organic polycations in the presence of NPS 568 but not the synergistic activation of Ca2+ with poly-l-Arginine. These data indicate that although the ECD has been thought to be the main determinant for Ca2+recognition, the 7TM core of the Ca2+ receptor contains activating site(s) recognizing Ca2+ and Gd3+ as well as the allosteric modulators NPS 568 and organic polycations that may play important roles in the regulation of receptor activation.

Systemic Ca2+ homeostasis is regulated largely by parathyroid hormone that acts on the kidney and bone to increase the level of plasma calcium. Parathyroid hormone secretion is regulated by the Ca2+ receptor, a novel cation-sensing G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRG-protein-coupled receptorGABABγ-aminobutyric acid receptor, type B7TMseven-transmembrane segmentsECDamino-terminal extracellular domainmGluRmetabotropic glutamate receptorhCaRhuman calcium sensing receptorExo-loop2second extracellular loopPIphosphoinositideHEKhuman embryonic kidneyIPinositol phosphatesPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid in parathyroid cells, which responds to changes in extracellular Ca2+concentrations (1Brown E.M.

Although Ca2+ is the endogenous ligand for the Ca2+ receptor, this cation-sensing receptor is also responsive in vitro to several di- and trivalent cations (Mg2+, Gd3+), certain cationic compounds (neomycin), and organic polycationic compounds (spermine, polyamine, amyloid β-peptide, poly-l-Arginine) (2Nemeth E.F. Fox J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 66-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Moreover, a small phenylalkylamine compound, NPS 568, has been identified as a positive allosteric modulator, which potentiates the actions of Ca2+ and other polycationic agonists at the Ca2+ receptor yet lacks a polycationic structure (3Nemeth E.F. Steffey M.E. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C. Van Wagenen B.C. Delmar E.G. Balandrin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar).

Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). The family 3 GPCRs are characterized by a very large (∼600 residues) autonomously folded extracellular amino-terminal domain (ECD) that shares structural similarity to the bilobed structure of bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (4Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar, 5Ray K. LifeXY. 2001; 2001: 1027-1035Google Scholar). Unlike GPCRs in the largest family (rhodopsin family or family 1) with ligand binding within the seven-transmembrane (7TM) core domain, both chimeric receptor analysis and direct binding assays with purified ECDs of several subtypes of mGluRs and GABAB receptor have suggested that the ECD of these family 3 receptors is responsible for ligand recognition (6Okamoto T.

Further, the crystal structures of the autonomously expressed ECD of mGluR1a in a complex with glutamate and in two unliganded forms show that each monomeric ECD contains a single bound glutamate (9Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the binding of small ligands like glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid to the ECD leads to conformational changes in the transmembrane domains and G protein activation has yet to be determined. It has been suggested that the family 3 GPCR structures evolved by the fusion of a periplasmic binding protein (the ECD) to a family 1 receptor (10Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1996; 367: 22Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This proposal implies that although the family 3 GPCR structures contain unique amino-terminal ligand recognition domains they will have conserved a mechanism of activation of the 7TM domain in common with family 1 receptors. The structural determinants for agonist binding and activation of the human Ca2+ receptor (hCaR) are presently unknown. Chimeric receptors with the hCaR ECD-linked to the mGluR1 7TM domain confer intracellular phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis responsiveness to extracellular Ca2+ to cells expressing the constructs (11Brauner-Osborne H. Jensen A.A. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18382-18386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar,12Hu J. Hauache O.M. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16382-16389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These results clearly identify the ECD as containing a Ca2+ recognition site(s). However, the existence of additional cation-binding site(s) in the 7TM domain of the hCaR has not been excluded by these results. Two laboratories have reported inconclusive or conflicting results suggesting the existence of either a Ca2+- or a Gd3+-binding site in the 7TM core domain of the hCaR (13Hammerland L.G. Krapcho K.J. Garrett J.E. Alasti N. Hung B.C.P. Simin R.T. Levinthal C. Nemeth E.F. Fuller F.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 77: 642-648Google Scholar, 14Hauache O.M., Hu, J. Ray K. Xie R. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4156-4163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Available data also indicate that the binding site for the synergistic phenylalkylamine NPS 568 resides in the transmembrane domain rather than the ECD of the hCaR (14Hauache O.M., Hu, J. Ray K. Xie R. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4156-4163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the hCaR lacks the well characterized Ca2+ binding domains present in many Ca2+-binding proteins, the hCaR contains several highly acidic regions in the ECD and an acidic segment in the second extracellular loop of the 7TM core (1Brown E.M. MaCLeod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Other di- and trivalent cations (Mg2+, Gd3+) and cationic compounds (spermine, poly-l-Arginine) which all act as partial agonists in vitro may specifically interact with some of these acidic regions. Moreover, the hCaR is a disulfide-linked dimer (15Ray K. Hauschild B.C. Steinbach P.J. Goldsmith P.K. Hauache O.M. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27642-27650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and activation of the hCaR by extracellular Ca2+ is steeply concentration-dependent with a Hill coefficient for activation between 3 and 4 (16Ruat M. Snowman A.M. Hester L.D. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5972-5975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism is undefined, it has been suggested that the steep concentration dependence results from the cooperative interaction of multiple Ca2+-binding sites (1Brown E.M. MaCLeod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies indicate that the hCaR contains multiple unidentified cation binding motifs both in the ECD and 7TM domains. The aim of this current study was to examine whether there are structural determinants in the 7TM domain responsible for selective agonist binding and subsequent activation of the hCaR. Here we report that not only Ca2+ but several other hCaR agonists, Mg2+, Gd3+, spermine, and poly-l-Arg can activate PI hydrolysis in cells expressing an hCaR construct consisting of the 7TM core domain but with the ECD replaced by the initial 20 amino acid residues of bovine rhodopsin. The phenylalkylamine compound NPS 568 allosterically potentiates the action of most of these cationic agonists. Further, we define acidic residues in the second extracellular loop (Exo-loop2) within the 7TM core as essential for the synergistic activation of the receptor by cations with NPS 568. This region is distinct from the site(s) for recognition of activating divalent metal ions and the synergistic organic polycations. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the hCaR cDNA cloned in the pCR3.1 expression vector using a commercial kit (QuickChangeTM, Stratagene) as described by Ray et al. (17Ray K. Fan G.F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31355-31361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The first 20 amino acid residues (MNGTEGPNFYVPFSNKTGVV) from the amino terminus of bovine rhodopsin were added to the amino terminus at residue 599 of a truncated hCaR construct (T903) with a stop codon at position 903 as described earlier (17Ray K. Fan G.F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31355-31361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The rhodopsin amino terminus tag has been shown to enhance proper processing and cell surface expression of several GPCRs (18Krautwurst D. Yau K.W. Reed R.R.

Cell. 2000; 100: 703-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). The resultant construct, designated as T903-Rhoc, replaced residues 1–598 of the amino-terminal ECD of the hCaR with the initial 20 amino acid residues of bovine rhodopsin followed by the amino acid residues 599–903 of the hCaR (see Fig. 1). As a strategy to ensure a high level of cell surface receptor expression, we generated T903-Rhoc mutant on the T903 carboxyl-terminal truncated mutant background with the carboxyl-terminal 177 amino acid residues deleted because the T903 carboxyl-terminal truncated receptor has shown a higher level cell surface expression but very similar phosphoinositide hydrolysis response to Ca2+ equivalent to that of the wild-type hCaR (17Ray K. Fan G.F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31355-31361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This construction was identical to the Rho-C-hCaR previously reported (20Zhao X-M. Hauache O. Goldsmith P.K. Collins R. Spiegel A.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A second construct, designated T903-RhocE/D5A, contains alanine substitution for all five acidic residues located in the Exo-loop2 of the T903-Rhoc receptor. Residues Glu-755, Glu-757, Asp-758, Glu-759, and Glu-767 were collectively mutated into alanine using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit. Mutations were confirmed by using a dRhodamine terminator cycle sequencing reaction kit and ABI prizm-377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). HEK 293 cells were cultured using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. A plasmid encoding T903-Rhoc under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter in the eukaryotic expression vector pCR 3.1 (Invitrogen) was transfected into HEK 293 cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as previously described (21Ray K. Clapp P. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34558-34567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Geneticin (G418, 800 mg/ml) selection of transfectants was initiated 2 days after transfection. Individual clones were isolated 3 weeks later, and the two highest expressing T903-Rhoc cell lines were selected on the basis of immunostaining and whole cell surface enzyme-linked immunoassays using the monoclonal antibody (B6–30N) recognizing the amino terminus of bovine rhodopsin (22Adamus G. Zam Z.S. Arendt A. Palczewski K. McDowell J.M. Hargrave P. Vision Res. 1991; 31: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A clonal HEK 293 cell line T903-Rhoc2.1 stably expressing T903-Rhoc was expanded in culture for functional studies. Plasmid DNA harboring T903-Rhoc and T903-RhocE/D5A cDNAs in pCR3.1 vector was introduced into HEK 293 cells by the LipofectAMINE transfection (Invitrogen) method. PI hydrolysis assays were performed 48 h after transfection. The PI hydrolysis assay has been described previously (17Ray K. Fan G.F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol.

Briefly, confluent cells in 24-well plates were replenished in medium containing 3.0 μCi/ml myo[3H]inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for overnight (16 h), followed by 30 min of incubation with Solution A (120 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.4 mm MgCl2, 20 mm LiCl, and 25 mm PIPES, pH 7.2) devoid of Ca2+. After removal of Solution A, cells were incubated for an additional 1 h with test agents dissolved in Solution A. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of HCl/methanol (1:1000, v/v) per well. Total inositol phosphates were purified by chromatography on Dowex 1-X8 columns. Samples were prepared for electrophoresis by incubation for 45 min at room temperature in Laemmli sample buffer to minimize rhodopsin oligomerization prior to application on precast 4–20% gradient gels (Novex). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose sheets, and reactivity with the monoclonal anti-rhodopsin antibody B6–30N was visualized by ECL as described (17Ray K. Fan G.F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31355-31361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). NPS 568, (R)-N-(3-methoxy-α-phenylethyl)-3-(2′-chlorophenyl)-1-(propylamine hydrochloride)), was generously provided by Drs. Allen Spiegel and Kenneth Jacobson, NIDDK. Poly-l-arginine (Mr, 100,000) and spermine were obtained from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Transduction Laboratories, and the ECL visualization kit was from Pierce. The hybridoma clone B6–30N was generously provided by Dr. Paul Hargrave (University of Florida). To investigate the pharmacological properties of the 7TM core domain of the hCaR, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to construct an ECD truncated hCaR with a rhodopsin epitope tag, resulting in a mutant receptor T903-Rhoc with 20 amino acids of the amino terminus of rhodopsin and the amino acid residues 599–903 of the hCaR. Fig. 1depicts schematically the structure of T903-Rhoc receptor with all amino acid residues present in this 7TM core domain of the hCaR. Forty-six clonal lines were selected by G418 resistance after transfection with the T903-Rhoc construct. Twelve of the surviving clones expressed the T903-Rhoc receptor mutant identified by positive immunoreactivity with the monoclonal anti-rhodopsin antibody B6–30N in cell surface immunocytochemical and enzyme-linked immunoassays (data not shown). For further pharmacological characterization, a clonal cell line T903-Rhoc2.1 was selected, which showed the highest level of cell surface expression of the T903-Rhoc mutant receptor. To estimate the abundance of receptor expressed in clone T903-Rhoc2.1 we performed quantitative Western blot analysis of the immunoreactivity with antibody B6–30N shown in the gel inset to Fig. 1. In the absence of a bovine rhodopsin tag, no reactivity is visualized, whereas B6–30N recognizes a prominent band of about 40 kDa in the T903-Rhoc2.1 clone. From the regression analysis of the bovine rhodopsin standards we can calculate the T903-Rhoc expression as 6 pmol/mg protein in the P2 membrane fractions derived from this cell clone. The experiments presented in Fig. 2 demonstrate that our ECD-deleted hCaR construct T903-Rhoc can be activated by many of the agonists regulating activity of the wild-type receptor. As shown in Fig. 2A, with no added Ca2+ present in the assay, several known agonists of the wild-type hCaR including Ca2+, Mg2+, Gd3+, and cationic molecules, poly-l-Arg and spermine, when tested individually showed very weak stimulation of PI hydrolysis in HEK 293 cells expressing T903-Rhoc. We consistently observed that 1 μm NPS 568, 2 mm Ca2+, and 250 nmpoly-l-Arg alone stimulated a small but significant increase in IP accumulation over basal values. However, co-addition of all of the cationic agonists with 1 μm NPS 568 resulted in varied but significant increases in IP accumulation in these cells, establishing that the T903-Rhoc structure contains activating ligand-binding sites for all of these agents. These results differ from data obtained for the full-length wild-type hCaR structure. As opposed to the T903-Rhoc, HEK 293 cells transfected with the wild-type hCaR respond fully to cations in the absence of NPS 568 and in the absence of added Ca2+ show no increase in the PI hydrolysis response over basal when exposed to 1 μm NPS 568 alone (data not shown). Activation by NPS 568 is obtained only in the presence of Ca2+ as has been reported previously (3Nemeth E.F. Steffey M.E. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C. Van Wagenen B.C. Delmar E.G. Balandrin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Synergistic activation of the T903-Rhoc was not limited to the phenylalkylamine NPS 568. Co-addition of 250 nmpoly-l-Arg with Ca2+ generated an equivalent increase in PI hydrolysis as seen with NPS 568 (Fig. 2B). Synergism by poly-l-Arg distinguishes among metal ion species. Whereas Ca2+ and Gd3+ produce equivalent activation of PI hydrolysis in the presence of NPS 568, the Gd3+ response is significantly lower than Ca2+with poly-l-Arg (Fig. 2B). This response seems to be specific for a polycation as no significant synergism of Ca2+ was found for poly-l-Glu. All these agonist effects were specific for T903-Rhoc expressing HEK 293 cells. Neither HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with vector alone nor an HEK 293 cell line stably expressing an equivalent ECD truncated mGluR1 7TM core domain showed any response to the optimal concentrations of these agents alone or in combination (data not shown). Fig. 3 presents the results of experiments characterizing the affinity of the metal ion activation of the 7TM core structure. As shown in Fig. 3A, in the presence of 1 μm NPS 568 a significant increase in IP formation occurs below 0.5 mm Ca2+. From these saturation data we calculate an EC50 value of 1.8 ± 0.4 mm for Ca2+ for activation of T903-Rhoc reflecting a greater sensitivity of the ECD-deleted receptor to Ca2+ than found for the wild-type structure. Further, although the activation of wild-type hCaR by Ca2+ is highly cooperative with apparent Hill coefficients of 3–4, the Ca2+ saturation of T903-Rhoc is well fit by a simple, one-site binding model (dashed line in Fig. 3A). Similarly, as shown in Fig. 3B, in the presence of 1 μm NPS 568 a significant increase in IP formation occurs between 25 and 100 μmGd3+. Neither the efficacy nor the apparent affinity of Gd3+ for the T903-Rhoc is well defined because concentrations above 0.5 mm showed a profound inhibition of IP accumulation (Fig. 3B). This observation is consistent with other reports that at millimolar concentration, this lanthanide inhibited IP formation, and thus Gd3+ cannot act as full functional agonist for the Ca2+ receptor (23Pearce S.H. Bai M. Quinn S.J. Kifor M. Brown E.M. Thakker R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1860-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the 7TM core domain of the hCaR contains one or more Ca2+-binding sites. In addition, these results indicate that other cationic molecules such as Mg2+, Gd3+, and the organic polycations poly-l-Arg and spermine can interact with the same or overlapping binding domains within the 7TM domain and can activate the ECD truncated T903-Rhoc receptor. Within the 7TM core domain, the Exo-loop2 contains a cluster of acidic residues that may form a binding site for Ca2+ and other cationic agonists. Based on this hypothesis, we constructed a mutant, T903-RhocE/D5A, in which all five negatively charged (Asp and Glu) residues located within the second extracellular loop domain of the T903-Rhoc (Glu-755, Glu-757, Asp-758, Glu-759, Glu-767) were collectively mutated into alanine (see Fig. 1). Both the T903-Rhoc and T903-RhocE/D5A mutant receptor expression constructs were transiently transfected in HEK 293 cells, and the PI hydrolysis assay was performed 48 h after transfection. As shown in Fig. 4, the T903-RhocE/D5A mutant receptor did not show significant synergistic response to Ca2+, Gd3+, or poly-l-Arg in the presence of 1 μm NPS-568 as compared with the T903-Rhoc. However, the T903-RhocE/D5A receptor-like T903-Rhoc demonstrates a significant synergistic Ca2+response in the presence of poly-l-Arg. As shown in Fig. 4, the combination of poly-l-Arg and Ca2+ elicited an increase in PI hydrolysis in the T903-RhocE/D5A receptor expressing cells similar to that for the T903-Rhoc receptor. These findings confirm that mutation of Exo-loop2 acidic residues impairs the cationic response of the T903-Rhoc receptor in the presence of one allosteric modifier NPS 568. However, in the presence of poly-l-Arg, the synergistic Ca2+ response of this mutant receptor remained largely intact. Like many family 3 GPCRs including mGluR1, mGluR2, and GABAB receptor, agonist binding seems to occur primarily within the large ECD of the hCaR rather than in the pocket defined by the 7TM helices as is characteristic of most classical rhodopsin-like (family 1) GPCRs (5Ray K. LifeXY. 2001; 2001: 1027-1035Google Scholar). As reported by several laboratories, a chimera with the entire hCaR ECD linked to the mGluR1 7TM confers PI hydrolysis responsiveness to extracellular Ca2+ (11Brauner-Osborne H. Jensen A.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16382-16389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This has been taken as evidence that the hCaR ligand specificity resides in the ECD and not in the 7TM domain. Two prior studies have investigated the signaling properties of hCaR constructs with deleted amino-terminal ECDs as controls for chimeric ECD constructs mapping the site(s) for Ca2+ recognition within the hCaR (13Hammerland L.G. Krapcho K.J. Garrett J.E. Alasti N. Hung B.C.P. Simin R.T. Levinthal C. Nemeth E.F. Fuller F.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 77: 642-648Google Scholar, 14Hauache O.M., Hu, J. Ray K. Xie R. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4156-4163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A deletion construct of this receptor (ΔntCaR), which lacked virtually the entire ECD, was unable to respond to Ca2+ but responded to Gd3+ when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (13Hammerland L.G. Krapcho K.J. Garrett J.E. Alasti N. Hung B.C.P. Simin R.T. Levinthal C. Nemeth E.F. Fuller F.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 77: 642-648Google Scholar). In contrast, Hauache et al. (14Hauache O.M., Hu, J. Ray K. Xie R. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4156-4163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported the 7TM domain of the hCaR as the site of action of NPS 568 compound as several hCaR mutants lacking all or part of the ECD were partially responsive to Ca2+ in the presence of NPS 568 in HEK 293 cells. Both of these studies raised the possibility that the 7TM core structure of the hCaR is sufficient for ligand-regulated activation of signaling as for a family 1 GPCR. Our data with T903-Rhoc confirm the signaling properties of the 7TM core domain and are the first demonstration that this structure has preserved a complex set of allosteric interactions autonomous of the amino-terminal ECD. These data lend credence to the proposal that the family 3 receptor structures may have arisen by the addition of an autonomous ligand recognition domain (the ECD) to a functional family 1 GPCR (10Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1996; 367: 22Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our data with T903-Rhoc clearly demonstrate Ca2+ recognition by the 7TM domain of the hCaR that is only revealed in the presence of an allosteric regulator such as NPS 568 and poly-l-Arg. These data lead us to conclude that the hCaR 7TM core contains at least three distinct activation sites: a Ca2+ and Gd3+ recognition site, a site for organic polycations (poly-l-Arg and spermine), and a site for the phenylalkylamine NPS 568. These cation sites and the site for the NPS 568 in the 7TM core are allosterically interacting. When added individually none of the cationic agonists or NPS 568 exhibited significant PI hydrolysis response. In the presence of NPS 568, cationic agonists exhibited varied but significant PI hydrolysis stimulation, and in the presence of poly-l-Arg, Ca2+ activated the T903-Rhoc receptor similar to the activation with NPS 568. These results indicate that NPS 568 or poly-l-Arg binds to an allosteric site(s) in the transmembrane region and synergistically potentiates cationic response of the T903-Rhoc receptor's 7TM domain. For a number of proteins that bind the Ca2+ ion, the side chains of Asp and Glu have been shown to participate in the stabilization hydrogen bond networks (24Sohma H. Creutz C.E. Saitoh M. Sano H. Kuroki Y. Voelker D.R. Akino T. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 203-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, residues in the second extracellular loop of several GPCRs including the CCK5, adenosine, and gonadotropin receptors, have been shown to be important for high affinity agonist binding and activation of the receptors (25Sun Y-M. Flanagan C.A. Illing N. Ott T.R. Sellar R. Fromme B.J. Hapgood J. Sharp P. Sealfon S.C. Millar R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7754-7761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,26Samson M. LaRosa G. Libert F. Paindavoine P. Detheux M. Vassart G. Parmentier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24934-24941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Here we found that the mutant T903-RhocE/D5A receptor with Exo-loop2 Asp and Glu residues changed to Ala did not respond to Gd3+ or poly-l-Arg in the absence or presence of NPS 568, and Ca2+ elicited a significantly lower maximal IP response compared with the T903-Rhoc receptor. Although this observation is consistent with the idea that some of the Asp and Glu residues in the Exo-loop2 may be directly involved in cation binding, the synergistic response of T903-Rhoc/D5A to Ca2+ and poly-l-Arg demonstrates that this mutant retains both a Ca2+ and an organic polycation recognition that stimulate the receptor equivalently to the parent T903-Rhoc. An alternative explanation for this result is that the Exo-loop 2 acidic residues either participate directly in the binding of NPS 568 or indirectly in the allosteric interaction of the NPS 568 site with the Ca2+ site. In this study we identify NPS 568 and organic cations as allosteric modulators of Ca2+ and other cationic agonists at sites within the 7TM of the hCaR using the ECD truncated hCaR (T903-Rhoc). These findings pose intriguing questions. What is the significance of a cation-binding site within the hCaR 7TM domain and does this cation-binding site have any functional importance in the context of the native receptor? Among all GPCRs, the hCaR is the only receptor known so far that binds several cations and cationic compounds and exhibits a cooperative activation process (1Brown E.M. MaCLeod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). This cooperativity suggests the possible existence of multiple interacting cation-binding sites; we suggest that these include sites in the ECD as well as in the 7TM domain of the hCaR. The mechanism by which the binding of Ca2+ to the ECD leads to conformational changes in the 7TM domain within the native hCaR has yet to be determined. A diverse spectrum of binding and activation motifs is recognized for the several varieties of GPCR structure (27Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). It is commonly thought for family 3 receptors that conformational changes induced in the ECD by ligand binding are transmitted to the 7TM domain by structural contacts between the ECD and Exo-loops connecting the 7TM domains. In the hCaR this allosteric interaction of the ECD with the Exo-loops may expose the 7TM domain Ca2+-binding site(s) accounting for the cooperative activation properties of the receptor. In this context, our results with the Exo-loop2 mutant T903-Rhoc/D5A might be interpreted to reveal an essential linkage in such an allosteric transition because this mutation has abrogated all of the synergistic interactions by the NPS 568 compound. Although the basic mechanism of the ECD conformational change and its interaction with the 7TM core domain seem to be critical for the activation of hCaR, mGluR1, and other receptors in this family (5Ray K. LifeXY. 2001; 2001: 1027-1035Google Scholar), there is little precedent for the molecular properties unique to the hCaR. Highly cooperative activation and allosteric activation by two different agonists is seemingly unique to hCaR and has not been observed even for the related mGluR receptor family (1Brown E.M. MaCLeod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Our results led us to propose distinct ligand recognition sites both in the ECD and the 7TM core of the hCaR that are allosterically cooperative. It may be that such distinct ligand recognition within the 7TM cores of other family 3 GPCR structures will be revealed by compounds analogous to the NPS 568. Future biochemical and structural studies are needed to test the generality of this proposed hypothesis."

We report here the expression, purification, and characterization of wild-type neuroserpin and neuroserpin containing the S49P mutation that causes FENIB. Wild-type neuroserpin formed SDS-stable complexes with tPA with an association rate constant and K i of 1.2 × 104m−1 s−1 and 5.8 nm, respectively. In contrast, S49P neuroserpin formed unstable complexes with an association rate constant and K i of 0.3 × 104m−1 s−1 and 533.3 nm, respectively. An assessment by circular dichroism showed that S49P neuroserpin had a lower melting temperature than wild-type protein (49.9 and 56.6 °C, respectively) and more readily formed loop-sheet polymers under physiological conditions. Neither the wild-type nor S49P neuroserpin accepted the P7-P2 α1-anti-trypsin or P14-P3 antithrombin-reactive loop peptides that have been shown to block polymer formation in other members of the serpin superfamily.

The “mousetrap” mechanism is central to the inhibitory function of the serpins but renders them susceptible to mutations that facilitate aberrant conformational change (16.Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Coughlin P.B. Gettins P.G. Irving J.I. Lomas D.A. Luke C.J. Moyer R.W. Pemberton P.A. Remold-O'Donnell E. Salvesen G.S. Travis J. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol.

Point mutations of α1-antitrypsin perturb the relationship between the reactive center loop and β-sheet A. This allows the sequential incorporation of the reactive loop of one molecule into β-sheet A of another to form chains of polymers that are retained within hepatocytes (30.Lomas D.A. Evans D.L.

These polymers tangle to form periodic acid-Schiff-positive, diastase-resistant inclusions that are associated with neonatal hepatitis, juvenile cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (33.Eriksson S. Carlson J. Velez R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 314: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). It was very striking that the mutations that underlie FENIB were in the same shutter domain of the serpin molecule as those that caused polymerization of α1-antitrypsin with accompanying liver disease (8.Davis R.L. Shrimpton A.E. Holohan P.D. Bradshaw C. Feiglin D. Collins G.H. Sonderegger P. Kinter J. Becker L.M. Lacbawan F. Krasnewich D. Muenke M. Lawrence D.A. Yerby M.S. Shaw C.M. Gooptu B. Elliott P.R.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Indeed, the examination of protein from the brains of affected individuals demonstrated that the inclusions were composed solely of mutant neuroserpin and that this had formed chains of loop-sheet polymers identical to those of mutant α1-antitrypsin, which accumulate within the liver (8.Davis R.L. Shrimpton A.E. Holohan P.D. Bradshaw C. Feiglin D. Collins G.H. Sonderegger P. Kinter J. Becker L.M. Lacbawan F. Krasnewich D. Muenke M. Lawrence D.A. Yerby M.S. Shaw C.M. Gooptu B. Elliott P.R.

Thus, it seems likely that the accumulation of neuroserpin polymers within the brain causes neuronal loss and hence dementia. However, there is evidence that neuroserpin is neuroprotective (36.Yepes M. Sandkvist M. Wong M.K. Coleman T.A. Smith E. Cohan S.L. Lawrence D.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 569-576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that a shift in the balance between plasminogen and plasmin balance can also cause neuronal cell death (37.Chen Z.-L. Strickland S. Cell. 1997; 91: 917-925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is impossible to predict whether the shutter domain mutants retain inhibitory activity. We report here the expression, purification, and characterization of wild-type neuroserpin and neuroserpin containing the S49P mutation that underlies FENIB. We show that S49P neuroserpin is not effective as a proteinase inhibitor and rapidly forms polymers under physiological conditions. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs (Hitchin, UK), and oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen (Paisley, UK). The expression vector pQE31 was from Qiagen (Crawley, UK). Ampicillin, kanamycin, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside were from Melford Laboratories Ltd. (Ipswich, UK). HiTrap chelating HP and HiTrap Q-Sepharose were from Amersham Biosciences. The tPA substrate S-2288 (H-d-Ile-Pro-Arg-para-nitroanilide) was from Chromogenix (Quadratech, Epsom, UK). 1,5-Dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethylketone and tPA were from Calbiochem. Unless otherwise stated, all experiments were carried out in a solution referred to as the buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.4). Synthetic peptides corresponding to the P7-P2 2By convention, serpin-reactive center loop residues are numbered according to the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (54.Schechter I. Berger A.

(Cambridge, UK) and MWB (Cambridge, UK), respectively. They were dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and water, respectively. The pUAST vector containing the cDNA for human neuroserpin was kindly provided by Dr. Clare Green (Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge, UK). Neuroserpin was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and inserted into the expression vector pQE31 by the restriction sites BamHI and KpnI. The S49P mutation was introduced by a two-step polymerase chain reaction. The sequence of the wild-type and mutant neuroserpin was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the entire neuroserpin gene. Recombinant proteins were expressed with a six-histidine tag at the N terminus. Escherichia coli were transformed with the plasmid containing wild-type and mutant neuroserpin, and the proteins expressed as described previously for α1-antitrypsin (38.Zhou A. Carrell R.W. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27541-27547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.8), and disrupted by sonication. The cell pellet was washed three times with buffer A containing 0.05% v/v Triton X-100 and once again with buffer A alone prior to solubilization in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mmNaH2PO4, 6 m guanidinium-HCl, pH 8.0. The protein was then refolded drop by drop overnight at 4 °C in 20 mm Na2HPO4, 100 mmNaCl, pH 7.8. This solution was loaded onto a HiTrap chelating column precharged with 0.1 m NiSO4. The bound protein was eluted as a single peak with an imidazole gradient (0–0.3m). The fractions were collected, dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), and loaded onto a HiTrap Q-Sepharose column. The bound protein was eluted with a NaCl gradient (0–1 m), dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.4, concentrated, and then stored at −70 °C. Purified neuroserpin migrated as a single band on SDS-PAGE and >90% was in a monomeric form when assessed by nondenaturing and transverse urea gradient PAGE (39.Zhou A. Faint R. Charlton P.

Wild-type neuroserpin (NS) and mutant neuroserpin (NS(S49P)) were incubated with varying amounts of tPA at 25 °C. Samples were taken at different time intervals, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 mm1,5-dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethylketone (final concentration) to inhibit any free tPA (40.Renatus M. Engh R.A. Stubbs M.T. Huber R. Fischer S. Kohnert U. Bode W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4797-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The samples were then mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored until the completion of the experiment. They were then thawed and boiled for 3 min. Proteins were resolved on a 10% w/v SDS gel and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. The density of the complex band was determined by densitometry scanning with the data being analyzed by a semilog plot against time using the software Quantity One (Bio-Rad). Inhibition rate constants (k aand k d) for the inhibition of tPA by NS or NS(S49P) were determined under pseudo-first order conditions,i.e. [I] ≥ 10 [E]0, using the progress-curve method (41.Belorgey D. Bieth J.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16416-16422Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 42.Bieth J.G. Method Enzymol. 1995; 248: 59-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Rate constants of inhibition were measured at 25 °C in inhibition buffer (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% w/v dodecyl-maltoside, pH 7.4) by adding tPA (20 nm) to a mixture of NS (from 200 to 1000 nm) or NS(S49P) (2000 nm) and the substrate S-2288 (1 mm) and recording the release of product as a function of time. The progress curves were analyzed according to Equation 1 (42.Bieth J.G. Method Enzymol. 1995; 248: 59-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 43.Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat.

The final kinetic parameters are the mean ± S.D. of at least three experiments. Circular dichroism (CD) experiments were performed using a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.4). Changes in the secondary structure of NS or NS(S49P) with time and temperature were measured by monitoring the CD signal at 216 nm for 24 h with protein concentrations between 0.5 and 1 mg/ml. The data were fitted to single or double exponential functions. Thermal unfolding experiments were performed by monitoring the CD signal at 216 or 222 nm between 25 and 95 °C using a heating rate of 1 °C/min at a concentration of 0.5 or 1 mg/ml. Melting points (T m) were calculated using an expression for a two-state transition as described previously (44.Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 45.Dafforn T.R. Della M. Miller A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49310-49319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The results are the average of three experiments. Polymerization of NS and NS(S49P) was assessed by nondenaturing PAGE in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.4). NS or NS(S49P) were incubated at a concentration ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg/ml at a temperature from 4 to 45 °C. Aliquots were taken overtime, and 2 μg of protein were loaded on a 7.5% w/v nondenaturing gel. The proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue or by silver staining. NS or NS(S49P) were incubated for 24 h at 0.5 mg/ml in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of a 6-mer peptide corresponding to the P7-P2 region of the reactive center loop of α1-antitrypsin or a 12-mer peptide corresponding to the P14-P3 region of the reactive center loop of antithrombin. As the polymerization of NS or NS(S49P) was fast compared with α1-antitrypsin and antithrombin, the experiments were conducted at both 37 and 15 °C. The results were analyzed by loading the sample onto a 7.5% w/v nondenaturing gel with or without 8m urea (46.Mahadeva R. Dafforn T.R. Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6771-6774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The presence of polymers was visualized by silver staining. The progress curve for wild-type neuroserpin did not reach a plateau, but the absorbance steadily increased with time. This indicates that the mechanism of inhibition is reversible, or that the enzyme adsorbs to the walls of the spectrophotometer cuvette and thus escapes inhibition (47.Faller B. Cadène M. Bieth J.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9230-9235Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the value of v s was reproducible for a fixed inhibitor concentration, and the profile ofv s versus [I] was hyperbolic and fitted well to a classical, fully competitive inhibition mechanism. The progressive increase in absorbance can therefore be attributed to the dissociation of the complex. This allowed calculation of the dissociation and association rate constants from Equation 2. The apparent pseudo-first order rate constant k obsincreased linearly with the NS concentration up to 1 μm(Fig. 1 A). Within this concentration range, the mechanism of inhibition of tPA by NS is consistent with a one-step reaction (41.Belorgey D. Bieth J.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16416-16422Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A k avalue of 1.2 × 104m−1 s−1 and ak d value of 7 × 10−5s−1 were calculated by regression analysis of the data using Equation 1 (Table I).Table IKinetic constants for the inhibition of tPA by NS and NS(S49P) at 25 °C and pH 7.4Inhibitork ak dK i1-aCalculated ask d/k a.m−1s−1s−1nmNS1.2 × 1047.0 × 10−55.8NS(S49P)0.3 × 1041.6 × 10−3533.31-a Calculated ask d/k a. Open table in a new tab The incubation of mutant NS(S49P) with tPA also resulted in a progress curve that did not reach a plateau (Fig. 1 B). The progress curve clearly shows a pre-steady-state release of product followed by a steady state, but in addition there is an increase in the rate of substrate hydrolysis. The first derivative of the data indeed shows an increase in the rate of hydrolysis after 30 min (data not shown). We were not able to follow the inhibition of tPA by NS(S49P) at the lowest concentration used for its inhibition by NS, and therefore, the rate constants k d and k a were only determined at a NS(S49P) concentration of 2 μm. Because of the increase in the rate of hydrolysis of the substrate after 30 min, the first 30 min of the progress curve were used to determined the kinetic constants. We calculated values of 0.3 × 104m−1 s−1 and 1.6 × 10−3 s−1 fork a and k d, respectively (Table I). The stability of the neuroserpin-tPA complex was also assessed by SDS-PAGE. NS forms an SDS-stable complex (Fig. 2 A) as has been reported previously (18.Hastings G.A. Coleman T.A. Haudenschild C.C. Stefansson S. Smith E.P. Barthlow R. Cherry S. Sandkvist M. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33062-33067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). After formation of the complex and inhibition of free tPA by 1,5-dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethylketone, there is the appearance of reactive loop-cleaved NS over time. This demonstrates dissociation of the covalent complex. The small amount of cleaved NS at the earliest time point in Fig. 2 A, lane 2, shows that the substrate pathway has only a minor effect on the turnover of wild-type NS. Densitometric analysis of the SDS-PAGE gel allowed the calculation of a k d for the NS·tPA complex of 1 × 10−4 s−1, a value comparable with that determined by direct measurement (Fig. 2 B). The complex formed between NS(S49P) and tPA more readily favors the substrate pathway. The analysis of the gel is complicated by the fact that the K i describing the interaction between NS(S49P) and tPA is high (∼0.5 μm) as determined kinetically. Even at a 12-fold molar excess of inhibitor, the dissociation process is not negligible (t 1/2dissociation = ∼7 min). Moreover, the complex that forms at a high ratio of NS(S49P) to tPA rapidly dissociates to give the reactive loop-cleaved protein, even if the remaining tPA activity is inhibited by 1,5-dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethylketone (Fig. 2 C). The melting points for NS and NS(S49P) were measured by monitoring the change in CD signal at 216 and 222 nm (data not shown) while increasing the temperature at 1 °C/min. Fig. 3, A and B, show typical melting curves for NS and NS(S49P) at 216 nm where the change in signal was the most pronounced. In both cases, there was a decrease in signal, but the amplitude was very different. The change in NS was large enough to readily calculate a T m of 56.6 (±0.3) °C. The change in signal was far less at the same concentration for NS(S49P) with a calculated T m of 49.9 (±1.2) °C. This difference in amplitude was not the result of a gross conformational transition within NS(S49P), because it had a typical serpin-unfolding transition on transverse urea gradient PAGE (Fig. 3 C). These gels also showed that NS was more stable than NS(S49P) with an unfolding transition at ∼6 m urea compared with 1 m urea for the mutant protein. NS and NS(S49P) were also incubated at 0.25 mg/ml between 4 and 90 °C for 15 min and then assessed by nondenaturing PAGE. Polymers appeared between 50 and 60 °C for NS and between 40 and 50 °C for NS(S49P), in good agreement with the T m calculated from the CD spectra (data not shown). Differences were observed in the far-UV CD spectra between NS and NS(S49P). Fig. 4 A shows that in their native form, the two inhibitors adopt a different configuration. The spectra for NS is very similar to the one observed for native α1-antitrypsin (48.Dafforn T.R. Mahadeva R. Elliott P.R. Sivasothy P. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9548-9555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In comparison, the CD profile for NS(S49P) was significantly more negative with an important increase in magnitude of the signal at 216 nm and a less significant decrease at 222 nm. Spectra were also taken after polymerization at 45 °C for 24 h. In both cases, the spectra were very similar to the one obtained for native NS(S49P) and were consistent with the formation of loop-sheet polymers as observed for α1-antitrypsin (48.Dafforn T.R.

https://openalex.org/W2025259186,"The SlyA protein from Salmonella typhimurium is a transcription factor that contributes to virulence. It is shown that a slyA mutant is attenuated in the presence of murine macrophages compared with the parent strain. Moreover, after growth in minimal medium, survival of the slyA mutant was reduced. Altered levels of flagellin (fliC), PagC, IroN, and outer membrane proteins suggest that the slyA mutation affects the surface properties of Salmonella. The isolated SlyA protein is a cofactor-free homodimer that recognizes five sites within the promoter region of the slyA gene. One of these sites contained a near perfect inverted repeat TTAGCAAGCTAA. The other four sites contained related sequences. Occupation of the SlyA sites in the slyA promoter prevented open-complex formation, consistent with the pattern of slyA::lacZ expression parental and slyA mutant strains. By combining the footprinting data with potential SlyA binding sites recovered from a pool of random DNA sequences, a consensus was defined and used to probe the NIH Salmonella unfinished genomes data base. These searches revealed the presence of consensus SlyA sites upstream of omp, ispA, xseB, slyA, and a gene encoding a protein with homology to a hemagglutinin. Accordingly, transcription of an omp::lacZ fusion was reduced in a slyA mutant. Given the difficulties in obtaining a comprehensive picture of intracellular gene expression, the definition of the DNA sequence recognized by a transcription factor (SlyA) that is essential for survival in the macrophage environment should allow a complete regulon of genes with altered expression upon exposure to macrophages to be determined once the S. typhimurium genome annotation is complete.

One of these sites contained a near perfect inverted repeat TTAGCAAGCTAA. The other four sites contained related sequences. Occupation of the SlyA sites in the slyA promoter prevented open-complex formation, consistent with the pattern of slyA::lacZ expression parental and slyA mutant strains. By combining the footprinting data with potential SlyA binding sites recovered from a pool of random DNA sequences, a consensus was defined and used to probe the NIH Salmonella unfinished genomes data base. These searches revealed the presence of consensus SlyA sites upstream of omp, ispA, xseB, slyA, and a gene encoding a protein with homology to a hemagglutinin. Accordingly, transcription of an omp::lacZ fusion was reduced in a slyA mutant. Given the difficulties in obtaining a comprehensive picture of intracellular gene expression, the definition of the DNA sequence recognized by a transcription factor (SlyA) that is essential for survival in the macrophage environment should allow a complete regulon of genes with altered expression upon exposure to macrophages to be determined once the S. typhimurium genome annotation is complete. Salmonella serotypes can infect many animal species, causing a variety of disease states ranging from mild enteritis to severe systemic salmonellosis. The precise nature of the disease is governed by the specific combination of host and serotype. Although many genes have been shown to be involved in pathogenesis, their precise roles in the various stages of disease are often ill defined. However, it seems clear that appropriate regulation of gene expression is essential for a pathogen to adapt to a particular host environment. The SlyA protein from Salmonella typhimurium is a member of the MarR family of transcription factors that are required for the adaptation of a variety of bacteria to different environments. The family includes: MarR and EmrR (Escherichia coli), which regulate genes involved in multiple antibiotic resistance; PecS (Erwinia chrysanthemi), which controls pectinase and cellulase production, facilitating the infection of fruit; HprR (Bacillus subtilis) required for hydrogen peroxide resistance and sporulation regulation; and RovA (Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis) required for the regulation of invasin expression (1Miller P.F.

Salmonella strains carrying slyA mutations are severely attenuated for virulence in mice by a variety of infection routes, including intragastric (4Libby S.J. Goebel W. Ludwig A. Buchmeier N. Bowe F.

Immun. 1996; 64: 5075-5084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, slyA mutants are unable to survive within the tissues of the reticuloendothelial system and are hypersensitive to the products of the respiratory burst, including hydrogen peroxide (6Buchmeier N. Bossie S. Chen C. Fang F.C. Guiney D.G. Libby S. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3725-3730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore it has been suggested that SlyA controls genes required for resistance to oxidative attack by the host and survival in macrophages (6Buchmeier N. Bossie S. Chen C. Fang F.C. Guiney D.G. Libby S. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3725-3730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the apparently fundamental role that SlyA plays in overcoming host defenses, little is known about the properties of the SlyA protein and its mechanism of action. SlyA was originally thought to be a hemolytic virulence factor by virtue of its ability to confer a hemolytic phenotype on E. coli K12 (4Libby S.J. Goebel W. Ludwig A. Buchmeier N. Bowe F. Fang F.C. Guiney D.G. Songer J.G. Heffron F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Subsequently it has been shown that E. coli possesses a gene (hlyE, also designated clyA, or sheA) encoding a novel hemolysin (7Wallace A.J. Stillman T.J. Atkins A. Jamieson S.J. Bullough P.A. Green J. Artymiuk P.J. Cell. 2000; 100: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Overproduction of S. typhimurium SlyA,Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae FNR (HlyX), or E. coli MprA proteins activate expression of hlyE, thereby conferring a hemolytic phenotype on E. coli (8Ludwig A.

Leal S.C. Moreno F. del Castillo I. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis led to the suggestion that a GC-rich sequence located between an unusual heptameric −10 element (TATGAAT) and a conventional −35 element in the hlyE promoter might be the site of SlyA interaction and thereby mediate activation of hlyE transcription (12Ludwig A. Bauer S. Benz R. Bergmann B. Goebel W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Here, we report that a slyA mutant strain is impaired in associating with macrophages and in starvation survival. A SlyA binding site consensus is defined, and data base searching reveals potential members of the SlyA regulon. Relevant characteristics of the bacterial strains and plasmids used are given in Table I. Bacteria were grown in L broth (tryptone, 10 g liter−1; yeast extract 5 g liter−1; NaCl 5 g liter−1) at 37 °C unless otherwise stated. Media were supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg ml−1), tetracycline (5–10 μg ml−1), chloramphenicol (20 μg ml−1) and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG, 100 μg ml−1) as appropriate. For β-galactosidase activity measurements, aerobic cultures were grown in 250 ml conical flasks containing 5 ml of medium with shaking at 200 rpm Promoter activities were estimated by measuring β-galactosidase production (all determinations were done in triplicate on at least two independent cultures) according to Miller (13Miller J.H.

Samples from stationary phase cultures were removed at intervals up to 48 h, and serial dilutions were plated on L agar to estimate the numbers of colony-forming units after overnight incubation at 37 °C. To investigate the effect of the slyA mutation on secreted proteins bacteria were collected by centrifugation, and the culture supernatants were filtered through 0.2-μm filters before precipitating the secreted proteins with trichloroacetic acid (10%, w/v). The precipitated proteins were washed with acetone before being dissolved in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% gels). Outer membrane proteins were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE of outer membrane fractions prepared by sarkosyl NL30 (2% v/v) treatment of total membrane fractions. Proteins were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Standard methods for the manipulation of DNA were followed (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1989Google Scholar). The slyA coding region was amplified and isolated as a 600-bp product by PCR using S. typhimurium genomic DNA as the template and primers MS1 (TTTTGGATCCATGAAATTGGAATCGCCACTAGG) and MS2 (TTTTGTCGACCGGCAGGTCAGCGTGTCG) containing unique BamHI and SalI restriction sites (underlined) to facilitate cloning into the expression vector pGEX-KG (15Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid (pGS1482) was transformed into E. coli JM109 to create the overproducing strain JRG4385. A fragment containing the slyA promoter was amplified and isolated as a 424-bp product by PCR, using S. typhimurium genomic DNA as the template and the primers VN7 (TTTTGAATTCAGAATGGCGGAAAGTAAACAGATG) and VN8 (TTTTGGATCCTTGATGAATATTGTGCAACGTGAC) containing unique EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites (underlined) to facilitate cloning into plasmid pRW50. This plasmid is referred to as pGS1384. Alterations to the promoter sequence for footprinting and bandshift analyses were achieved by PCR using appropriate pairs of mutagenic primers. A pBR322 derivative containing the slyA promoter and coding region on an ∼750-bp EcoRI-BamHI fragment amplified from S. typhimurium genomic DNA using primers S583 (TTTTGAATTCAATGCTTTAGTTTTAGCC) and S584 (TTTTGGATCCCGGCAGGTCAGCGTG) was constructed. Automated DNA sequencing was used to confirm the sequence of the amplified products. The murine macrophage-like cell line J774 was used to investigate the effects of a slyA lesion on the interaction between S. typhimurium and macrophages. The J774 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) 1The abbreviations used are: DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPBSphosphate-buffered salineDAPI4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochlorideGSTglutathione S-transferaseIPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosideICP-MSinductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometryRNAPRNA polymerase containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, and 1 × 105 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in 24-well tissue culture plates and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. The medium was removed from the wells, and the coverslips were washed twice in DMEM before adding 0.5 ml of fresh DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum and 4% bovine serum albumin to the wells. The plates were then incubated for a further 30 min in the presence of 5% CO2. The S. typhimurium strain ST12/75 and the isogenic slyA mutant (Table I) were grown aerobically in nutrient broth for 16 h. These cultures were used as 1% (v/v) inocula for fresh nutrient broth and grown without shaking at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 to A600 nm ∼0.6. The bacteria were harvested, resuspended in DMEM plus 10% (v/v) BALB/c mouse serum (Harlan Sera-Lab), and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 5% CO2. The bacteria were washed in PBS, resuspended in DMEM, and vortexed with glass beads for 1 min to prevent clumping of the cells. The medium was removed from the macrophages and 1 × 107 bacteria in 200 μl of DMEM was added to the wells. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 for up to 3 h. At 30-min intervals the bacterial suspension was removed, and the wells were washed twice with PBS. The cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 for at least 15 min. The wells were then washed with PBS. Control wells were included, without S. typhimurium (DMEM only added) to check for contamination, and without macrophages (bacterial suspensions only) to check there was no significant binding of bacteria to the glass coverslips. The coverslips were irrigated with PBS containing 1:50 rabbit anti-Salmonella O antibody (Bacto) and incubated at 37 °C for 12 min. This was followed by 1:20 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) plus 5% goat serum at 37 °C for 12 min. The wells were then washed with PBS. The macrophages and bacteria were counterstained with the nucleic acid stain DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride) (Molecular Probes), diluted 1:2,500 in PBS, and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 min. The DAPI solution was removed, and the wells were washed with water. The coverslips were removed from the wells and air-dried. They were mounted onto microscope slides with Vectashield mounting fluid (Molecular Probes) and viewed at ×1000 magnification using a DMRB 1000 fluorescence microscope (Leica, Germany). The total number of DAPI-stained bacteria attached to macrophages was counted; internalization of bacteria was estimated by subtracting the numbers of extracellular bacteria (identified by co-localization with fluorescein isothiocyanate) from this number. Each experiment was carried out at least in triplicate. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride glutathione S-transferase isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry RNA polymerase SlyA was amplified as a GST-SlyA fusion in JRG4385. Aerobic cultures were grown at 25 °C to A600 0.6 at which point expression was induced by the addition of IPTG (100 μg ml−1). Incubation was continued for a further 3 h when the bacteria were collected by centrifugation and used immediately or stored at −20 °C. Clarified cell-free extracts were produced by resuspending the bacteria in 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2 and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and lysing the cells by two passages through a French pressure cell, followed by centrifugation. The GST-SlyA fusion protein was adsorbed onto a column (1 ml liter−1 culture) of GSH-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the resuspension buffer. The SlyA protein was released from the fusion by incubating the column overnight with 5 units of thrombin (Sigma) and eluting the protein in resuspension buffer. Protein concentration was estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The oligomeric state of SlyA was determined by native polyacrylamide gels (4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 7, 8, and 9%) containing Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), with protein standards of carbonic anhydrase (29,000), β-lactoglobulin (35,000), aldolase (160,000), catalase (240,000), and thyroglobulin (670,000), and by gel filtration using a calibrated Sephacryl S-100 HR column (standards: aprotinin, 6,500; RNase A, 13,700; chymotrypsinogen, 25,000; bovine serum albumin, 66,000; blue dextran, 2,000,000) equilibrated with 5 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmCaCl2, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. The optical spectrum of SlyA was obtained using a Unicam UV-4 spectrophotometer. The iron content of the protein was determined by denaturing samples of SlyA with 1% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and boiling to release protein-bound iron. After centrifugation to remove precipitated protein, saturated sodium acetate (0.4 ml in a final assay volume of 1 ml), sodium ascorbate (2% w/v) and bathophenanthroline (0.2% w/v) were added. The amount of iron in the samples was calculated by measuring the absorbance at 535 nm and comparing the values obtained to a standard curve constructed with serial dilutions of ferrous ammonium sulfate solutions. The total metal ion content of the SlyA protein was estimated by ICP-MS on samples of freeze-dried protein dissolved in water. The metal ion content of the solvent was also determined. The SlyA N-terminal amino acid sequence was obtained using standard technology with an Applied Biosystems protein sequencer. The slyA promoter region (P slyA) was amplified by PCR using plasmid pGS1384 as the template and primers VN7 and VN8. The resulting products were cut with restriction enzyme BamHI, allowing 3′ radiolabeling of the top strand by Klenow enzyme and [α-32P]dGTP. DNA binding in vitro was tested by bandshift analyses on 6% non-denaturing TBE-buffered polyacrylamide gels, using radiolabeled Ps lyA DNA fragments. Approximately 10 ng of DNA and 0.2–5.0 μm SlyA protein were co-incubated for 2 min at 25 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mm KCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (total incubation volume 10 μl), before loading onto the gel for autoradiographic analysis. The effect of SlyA on the binding of RNA polymerase to P slyA in vitro was tested by bandshift analyses on 5% non-denaturing TBE-buffered polyacrylamide gels, using 0.64 units of E. coli RNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences) and/or 1.2 μm SlyA as appropriate. The various combinations of proteins were incubated with ∼10 ng of radiolabeled DNA for 2 min at 25 °C in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mm KCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (total incubation volume 10 μl). Where appropriate the resulting complex was then challenged with heparin (0.1 mg ml−1) for 2 min at 25 °C before loading onto the gel for autoradiographic analysis. The reactions (total volume 10 μl) contained radiolabeled P slyA (∼10 ng), SlyA (2.0 and 4.0 μm), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. The mixtures were incubated for 2 min at 25 °C, followed by digestion with DNase I (1 μl of 1 unit μl−1 for 15–60 s at 25 °C). Reactions were stopped by addition of 200 μl of 0.3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) containing 20 mm EDTA followed by phenol/chloroform extraction. The DNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 10 μl of loading buffer (80% v/v formamide, 0.1% w/v SDS, 10% v/v glycerol, 8 mm EDTA, 0.1% w/v bromophenol blue, 0.1% w/v xylene cyanol) for electrophoretic fractionation on 6% polyacrylamide-urea gels and autoradiographic analysis. Maxam and Gilbert G tracks of the DNA fragments were used to provide a calibration (16Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8988) Google Scholar). The reactions (total volume 20 μl) contained P slyA (∼20 ng), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mm KCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, SlyA (1.2 μm), and/or RNA polymerase (1.28 units) as appropriate. The mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min, and then where indicated the resulting complexes were challenged with heparin (0.1 mg ml−1) for 2 min before the addition of 1 μl of 200 mm KMnO4. The mixtures were incubated for a further 4 min at 25 °C. The reactions were stopped with 50 μl of 0.3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) containing 20 mmEDTA and 1.5 m 2-mercaptoethanol, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction. The DNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 10 μl of loading buffer (see above) for electrophoretic fractionation on 6% polyacrylamide-urea gels and autoradiographic analysis. The transcription start point of P slyA was determined by RNA extraction (17Aiba H. Adhya S. Decrombrugge B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1905-1910Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and primer extension. Total RNA was prepared from stationary phase (24 h) S. typhimurium pGS1384 grown aerobically in L broth. For primer extension the method of Gerischer and Durre (18Gerischer V. Durre P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 426-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used with 100 μg of RNA and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (40 units) (Transgenomic). After ethanol precipitation the cDNA was fractionated on 6% urea-polyacrylamide gels for autoradiographic analysis. The gels were calibrated using Maxam and Gilbert G tracks of Ps lyA and P FF(-41.5) (16Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8988) Google Scholar). The method was based on the SELEX procedure. The following oligonucleotides were synthesized: A, 5′-TGACGAATTCACGTG N20GTACGGATCCATGCG-3′, where N indicates that either G, A, T, or C was inserted at that position; B, 5′-TGACGAATTCACGTG-3′; C, 5′-CGCATGGATCCGTAC-3′. Double-stranded DNA was generated by PCR with 1 μmoligonucleotide A as a template and 5 μm each oligonucleotides B and C as primers in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mm KCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dNTPs, and 5 units of Taq polymerase. The reaction mixture was heated at 94 °C for 2 min, then for each of 12 cycles was denatured at 92 °C for 1 min, annealed at 46 °C for 1 min, and extended at 72 °C for 1 min. A sample (2 μl) of the resulting mixture was used as a template for a further amplification, and the two reactions were pooled. E. coli strain JRG4385 was grown aerobically at 25 °C to A600 nm ∼0.6. Expression of GST-SlyA was induced by the addition of 100 μg ml−1 IPTG, and the cultures were incubated for a further 3 h. The bacteria were collected, resuspended in 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and lysed by two passages through a French pressure cell. The extract was then clarified by centrifugation. Crude extract containing GST-SlyA was then mixed with 0.1 ml GSH-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). A column was made with 50 μl of the mixture, which was washed with 5 column volumes of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mm KCl, 0.1% v/v Triton X-100). The pooled PCR products were passed through the column followed by washing with 5 column volumes of binding buffer. Bound DNA was eluted with 1 column volume of 3 m sodium acetate, and ethanol precipitated. The DNA was resuspended in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.5) and used as the template for five more PCRs (using oligonucleotides B and C as primers), which were pooled and used for further rounds of selection on GST-SlyA columns. After a total of three rounds of selection and amplification, the eluted DNA was cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector System I (Promega). After transformation into E. coli strain JM109, the plasmids were recovered, and the cloned regions were sequenced and analyzed. The same protocol was used with columns prepared with glutathione-S-transferase (GST) only to ensure that the DNA recovered was interacting specifically with SlyA and not GST or the column matrix. It has been reported that slyA mutants are unable to survive within the tissues of the reticuloendothelial system and are hypersensitive to the products of the respiratory burst including hydrogen peroxide (6Buchmeier N. Bossie S. Chen C. Fang F.C. Guiney D.G. Libby S. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3725-3730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the interaction of parental and slyA mutant strains of S. typhimurium with J774 macrophages was measured. After 30 min of incubation, approximately equivalent numbers of wild type and mutant organisms were associated with the surface of macrophages, but thereafter, over a 2.5-h chase, the numbers of wild type organisms associated with cells increased (Fig. 1 a). In contrast, the slyA mutant strain exhibited no such increase. The difference was greatest after 180 min, when on average ∼4-fold more bacteria were associated with each macrophage for the parent strain compared with the slyA mutant. The proportion of bound bacteria that were internalized at any point during the chase was similar for the parent and slyA mutant strains, with ∼60% internalization after 30 min and ∼78% internalization after 180 min (Fig. 1 b). Therefore SlyA may be acting by conferring resistance to extracellular killing or by facilitating adherence to macrophage receptors that transduce a benign intracellular course. Because slyA expression is maximal in stationary phase (6Buchmeier N. Bossie S. Chen C. Fang F.C. Guiney D.G. Libby S. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3725-3730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) the effect of the slyA lesion on stationary phase survival of S. typhimurium was investigated in a defined Tris-minimal medium. The aerobic growth kinetics of the parent and mutant were similar (not shown). However, survival of the slyA strain, as judged by the number of colony-forming units remaining over a 48-h period, was dramatically reduced compared with the parent (Fig. 2 a). Investigation of the amount of protein present in culture supernatants of the parent and slyA strain grown in the Tris-minimal medium revealed that the amount of flagellin (FliC), (identified by N-terminal amino acid analysis, AQVINTNSLSL) produced by the slyA mutant was much reduced compared with the parental strain (Fig. 2 b). This observation is consistent with the slyA mutant phenotype of reduced survival within macrophages (6Buchmeier N. Bossie S. Chen C. Fang F.C. Guiney D.G. Libby S. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3725-3730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) because previous studies have indicated that a fliD (encodes a flagellar hook protein) mutant has diminished capacity to survive within macrophages (19Baumler A.J. Kusters J.G. Stojiljkovic I. Heffron F. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1623-1630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Diagle F. Graham J.E. Curtiss III R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1211-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Further investigation revealed altered levels of outer membrane proteins including OmpC, OmpF, OmpA, PagC (a protein known to be required for full virulence and survival in macrophages), and IroN (a TonB-dependent outer membrane siderophore receptor) when the parent was compared with the slyA mutant (Fig. 2 b). In the presence of SlyA the amount of truncated OmpA (Mr ∼30,000, cf. full-length OmpA 35,000) was greater than in the absence of SlyA, suggesting that SlyA may influence the processing of this protein (Fig. 2 b). Mass spectrometry suggested that the ratio of OmpC:OmpF was greater for the parent than for the mutant. Moreover, the slyA mutant possessed reduced amounts of IroN, but the level of PagC was increased (Fig. 2 b). These two proteins are both associated with virulence and survival within macrophages, providing a direct link with the slyA phenotype. These data suggest that slyA is important for survival of Salmonella in the stationary phase, consistent with previous observations that slyA expression is enhanced in stationary phase cultures (6Buchmeier N. Bossie S. Chen C. Fang F.C. Guiney D.G. Libby S. Infect.

The cDNAs of the five species encoded polypeptides of 244 amino acids, which shared more than 85% identity with each other and showed high identity with a human sperm 34-kDa protein, P34H, as well as a murine lung-specific carbonyl reductase of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. In particular, the human protein is identical to P34H, except for one amino acid substitution. The purified recombinant proteins of the five species were about 100-kDa homotetramers with NADPH-linked reductase activity for α-dicarbonyl compounds, catalyzed the oxidoreduction between xylitol and l-xylulose, and were inhibited competitively by n-butyric acid. Therefore, the proteins are designated as dicarbonyl/l-xylulose reductases (DCXRs). The substrate specificity and kinetic constants of DCXRs for dicarbonyl compounds and sugars are similar to those of mammalian diacetyl reductase and l-xylulose reductase, respectively, and the identity of the DCXRs with these two enzymes was demonstrated by their co-purification from hamster and guinea pig livers and by protein sequencing of the hepatic enzymes. Both DCXR and its mRNA are highly expressed in kidney and liver of human and rodent tissues, and the protein was localized primarily to the inner membranes of the proximal renal tubules in murine kidneys. The results imply that P34H and diacetyl reductase (EC 1.1.1.5) are identical tol-xylulose reductase (EC 1.1.1.10), which is involved in the uronate cycle of glucose metabolism, and the unique localization of the enzyme in kidney suggests that it has a role other than in general carbohydrate metabolism.

Carbonyl compounds are routinely generated in the course of metabolic reactions and by oxidative stresses in a variety of biological systems. When two carbonyl groups juxtapose on a carbon chain, the reactivity of each carbonyl group tends to be elevated, and those compounds with such α-dicarbonyl groups are known to be prone to conversion into advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). 1The abbreviations used are: AGEadvanced glycation endproductMLCRmouse lung carbonyl reductaseSDRshort-chain dehydrogenase/reductaseDCXRdicarbonyl/l-xylulose reductaseRT-PCRreverse transcription-PCRESTexpressed sequence tagRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsRTroom temperatureP26hhamster sperm 26-kDa proteinP34Hhuman sperm 34-kDa proteinPBSphosphate-buffered saline AGEs are a group of insoluble complex compounds that frequently accumulate in the plasma proteins and tissues of diabetic subjects and are also associated with renal failure regardless of diabetic background (1Sell D.R.

The starting compounds are assumed to originate from carbohydrates such as glucose and fructose, or from lipid compounds, which then undergo a non-enzymatic Maillard reaction followed by a series of as yet unidentified non-enzymatic and enzymatic reactions, via major intermediate compounds harboring an α-dicarbonyl group in their molecules (1Sell D.R.

The AGEs subsequently stimulate a group of scavenger receptors called RAGEs, leading to an aberrant production of inflammatory cytokines (6Schmidt A.M. Vianna M. Gerlach M. Brett J. Ryan J. Kao J. Esposito C. Hegarty H. Hurley W. Clauss M. Wang F. Pan Y.-C. E. Tsang T.C. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14987-14997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Horiuchi S. Murakami M.

In addition, by cross-linking proteins, especially those with long lives such as collagen, laminin, and other extracellular matrix proteins, AGEs may cause sclerotic disorders in the blood vessels and in tissues (8Dyer D.G.

This may eventually lead to the progression of diabetic retinopathy (9Hammes H.P. Martin S. Federin K. Geisen K. Brownlee M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biophys. 1993; 307: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); however, a question remained of whether there exists one or more reductases working specifically in the renal system. Supporting this notion, it is widely noted that renal failure is one of the major causes accounting for the accumulation of AGEs on plasma proteins and tissues, most prominently in the tubules of the nephron (12Makita Z. Bucala R. Rayfield E.J. Friedman E.A. Kaufman A.M. Korbet S.M. Barth R.H. Winston J.A. Fuh H. Manogue K.R. Cerami A. Vlassara H. Lancet. 1994; 343: 1519-1522Abstract PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has been postulated that the function of the renal tubules is pivotal to the clearance of AGEs and their precursors, dicarbonyl compounds (13Gugliucci M. Bendayan M. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In the course of screening potential renal therapeutic target genes, we have constructed a 3′-directed cDNA library from materials enriched with renal tubules and glomeruli of mouse kidney to generate a gene expression profile of the kidney. Following large-scale sequencing of about 1000 random cDNA clones, a non-biased representation of the mRNA population in the kidney was obtained. A data base survey of the sequences revealed that one of these candidate clones displayed significant sequence homology with mouse lung carbonyl reductase (MLCR (14Nakanishi M. Deyashiki Y. Ohshima K. Hara A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)), which is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily (15Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. González-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). This inspired us to further investigate its possible involvement in renal carbonyl detoxification. Subsequent PCR-based homologue cloning yielded the isolation of human, hamster, rat, and guinea pig counterparts of the murine cDNA. The enzymatic characterization of the recombinant proteins expressed from the cDNAs of the five species shows that they turn out to be reductases that are specific for dicarbonyl compounds, i.e. diacetyl reductase (EC 1.1.1.5). Surprisingly, the recombinant proteins also displayed significant reductase activity toward l-xylulose, and the identity of diacetyl reductase with l-xylulose reductase (EC 1.1.1.10) has been demonstrated by co-purification of the two enzyme activities from guinea pig liver, in whichl-xylulose reductase was first identified (16Touster O. Reynolds V.H. Hutcheson R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 221: 697-709Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we designated the protein encoded in the isolated cDNA as dicarbonyl/l-xylulose reductase (DCXR). Furthermore, we report the distribution of DCXR in the tissues of the five mammals investigated as well as its immunohistochemical localization in rat and mouse kidneys. Fractions enriched with glomeruli and renal tubules were prepared from male BALB/c mice using magnetic beads (Dynabeads M280 and M450, Dynal A.S., Oslo, Norway). Heparin (10 units/100 μl) was injected into the tail vein of a mouse, and 0.2 ml of a Dynabeads M280 suspension (6×108/ml), followed by 0.2 ml of a Dynabeads M450 suspension (4×108/ml), was injected through the renal afferent arteriole after a ventral opening operation. The kidney was removed and minced, and then the glomerular fraction was collected following the sieving selection (17Grant M.E. Harwood R. Williams I.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 54: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The tissue fraction containing the Dynabeads was separated from the other tissues by magnetic force to obtain the fraction enriched with glomeruli and renal tubules. The collected fragments were examined under a light microscope to confirm the enrichment of glomeruli (roughly 7.5 × 103glomeruli and 4 × 103 renal tubule fragments in a 0.1-ml suspension). The extraction of RNA, the synthesis of cDNA followed by its MboI digestion, the construction of the cDNA library, and the subsequent body mapping analysis were performed as described previously (18Okubo K. Hori N. Matoba R. Niiyama T. Fukushima A. Kojima Y. Matsubara K. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 19Takenaka M. Imai E. Kaneko T. Ito T. Moriyama T.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The short cDNA fragments (average size of 256 bp) generated by the MboI digestion were sequenced using a PRIM 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A cDNA clone that showed high expression frequency (3 out of 958 clones) was subjected to further cloning of the cDNA containing a full-length open reading frame. The complete cDNA was isolated by PCR using a forward primer (5′-TGCTGCGAGAAGACGACAGAAT-3′) in the CapFinder cDNA library construction kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and a reverse primer (5′-AGTGGTCATGCCACTCCGGTTGCTCAG-3′), which was designed based on the sequence of one DCXR cDNA fragment containing a putative 3′-untranslated sequence. The sequence of this clone was determined by repeating PCR using a set of primers, Expf and Expr (see Table I), and then sequencing of the amplified products.Table INucleotide sequences of the primers used in this studyPrimerSequencePositionRestriction enzymehu-1fTACGGCTGCGAGAAGACGACAGAGGGhu-2fTACGGCTGCGAGAAGACGACAGAAhu-3rCCAAGCTTGTAGGATGAGCACGGCATGG759–786hu-4fCAGGATCCATG GAGCTGTTCCTCGCGGGC1–21BamHIhu-5rCAGAATTCTCA GCAGGCCCAGAAGCCCCCTTC711–735EcoRIExpfCC GAATTC ATG GACCTGGGGCTTGCA1–18EcoRIExprCC AAGC TTA GGTAGCCAGGAAGCCC717–735Hin dIIIra-NfAA CAT ATG GACCTGGGTCTTGCAG1–19NdeIha-KrCC AAGC TTA GGTAACCAGGAAGCCC717–735Hin dIIIhu-NfGG CAT ATG GAGCTGTTCCTCGCGGGCCG1–23NdeIhu-KrAA GGTACC TTA GCAGGCCCAGAAG720–735KpnIRace-1rCAGTGCTGCGCCCGATGCCTTT49–70Race-2rCCACCGGTCCCACACTGCTTA212–232Race-3rGGTGACCTCCAGGAA274–288Race-4rCAGGTCCACACACACAGGCT164–183Race-5rCCTGTTCTGTGGCCTCCCAGT188–208Race-2fGGTGCTCTGGACATGCTGAC460–479Race-4fAAGATGATGGCCCTTGAGC481–499Race-5fCTGGATCGAATCCCACTTGG601–620The restriction enzyme cutting site in each sequence is shown in italic, and the initiation and stop codons are indicated in bold.

The nucleotide positions correspond to those of the cDNA species isolated, and Race-1r through -5r and Race-2f through -5f were the primers used in the 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE, respectively. The human counterpart was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). First-strand cDNA was prepared from human kidney mRNA (CLONTECH) using the SMART PCR library construction kit (CLONTECH) with the oligomer hu-1f as a cap finder and then was subjected to PCR with the primers hu-2f (with affinity to the cap-binding site of the single-strand cDNA) and the gene-specific primer, hu-3r. The hu-3r was designed to anneal the sequence outside the putative open reading frame based on a human Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) sequence similar to the mouse DCXR cDNA (see Table I). Finally, the open reading frame was amplified with a pair of primers, hu-4f and hu-5r, containing recognition sites for restriction enzymes for the later subcloning process. The cDNAs for rat, hamster, and guinea pig DCXRs were isolated from the total RNA preparations of rat kidney and livers of hamsters and guinea pigs by RT-PCR and subsequent RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends). The amplification of the cDNAs for the DCXRs of the three species by PCR was achieved with a set of primers, Expf and Expr, which correspond to nucleotides 1–18 and 717–735, respectively, of the cDNA for mouse DCXR. The 3′- and 5′-ends of the cDNAs were generated by using 3′- and 5′-RACE kits (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the gene-specific primers (see Table I). The cDNAs were subcloned into the sequencing vector, pGEMT (Promega, Madison, WI) or pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced as described above. To express the recombinant human and rodent DCXRs, the coding regions of the cDNAs were amplified by PCR using the following sets of primers containing restriction enzyme cutting sites (see Table I). The PCR primers were hu-Nf and hu-Kr (for human DCXR cDNA), ra-Nf and ha-Kr (for hamster DCXR cDNA), and ra-Nf and Expr (for other rodent DCXR cDNAs). Although the sequences of the primers were different by one or two nucleotides from those of the corresponding regions of the rodent DCXR cDNAs, the deduced amino acids were not changed. The amplified DNA fragments were digested with the restriction enzymes, then ligated into pRset plasmids. DNA sequencing confirmed that no unintended base substitution had been incorporated in the coding regions of the expression plasmids. Expression of the recombinant DCXRs in Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and preparation of the cell extract were performed as described previously (14Nakanishi M. Deyashiki Y. Ohshima K. Hara A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The recombinant DCXRs were purified from the cell extract according to the procedures for purification of hamster liver diacetyl reductase (21Hara A. Seiriki K. Nakayama T. Sawada H. Flynn T.G. Weiner H. Enzymology of Carbonyl Metabolism 2: Aldehyde Dehydrogenase, Aldo-keto Reductase, and Alcohol Dehydrogenase. Alan R. Liss Inc., New York1985: 291-304Google Scholar), except that a Matrex Red A (Amicon, Beverly, MA) column was used instead of the Blue-Sepharose column. The adsorbed DCXR was eluted from the Matrex Red A column with buffer containing 0.5 mmNADP+. It should be noted that, because the activities of the recombinant rodent DCXRs were gradually inactivated below 10 °C, the chromatography was carried out at room temperature (RT, 20–25 °C), and the buffers were supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol to prevent cold inactivation. Recombinant MLCR and hamster sperm 26-kDa protein, P26h, were prepared as described in Refs. 14Nakanishi M. Deyashiki Y. Ohshima K. Hara A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar and22Ishikura S. Usami N. Kitahara K. Isaji T. Oda K. Nakagawa J. Hara A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, respectively. Hamster liver diacetyl reductase was purified as described in Ref. 21Hara A. Seiriki K. Nakayama T. Sawada H.

Liss Inc., New York1985: 291-304Google Scholar. l-Xylulose reductase was purified from male Hartley guinea pig livers (50 g) essentially according to the same procedures employed for the purification of hamster diacetyl reductase. Since guinea pig l-xylulose reductase was also unstable at 4 °C, all the chromatography steps were performed at RT using the buffers containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, and the following modifications were made. 1) The enzyme was eluted from the DEAE-Sephacel column with 30 mm NaCl in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA and 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol after washing the column with buffer containing 10 mm NaCl. 2) The Blue-Sepharose column was washed with buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), and then the enzyme was eluted with buffer A containing 0.5 mm NADP+. The standard reaction mixture for the reductase activity consisted of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 0.1 mm NADPH, substrate and enzyme, in a total volume of 2.0 ml. Diacetyl (5 mm) was employed as the substrate for DCXR and hamster liver diacetyl reductase, and 1 mm l-xylulose was used as the substrate for guinea pig liver l-xylulose reductase. The dehydrogenase activities of the enzymes were measured in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.25 mmNADP+ and alcohol substrate. Sugars were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, U.S.A.) and Fluka Chemie (Buchs, Switzerland), except that 3-deoxyglucosone was a gift from Dr. V. Monnier (Case Western Reserve University). One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the reduction and formation of 1 μmol of NADPH per min at 25 °C. A kinetic analysis of the enzyme reaction was carried out in 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at five different concentrations of the substrate or coenzyme to obtain apparent Km and Vmax values. Kinetic studies in the presence of inhibitors were carried out in a similar manner. In addition to the kinetic constants, the inhibition constant,Ki, was calculated by using the appropriate programs of the ENZFITTER (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). All standard errors of fits were less than 15%. Cold inactivation experiments were carried out as follows. The enzyme (0.4 mg/ml) was dialyzed against 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 25 °C for 8 h, and then diluted with 9 volumes of the buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The enzyme solution was incubated in an ice bath or at various temperatures, and 50-μl aliquots of the solution were taken at different times and analyzed for the diacetyl reductase activity as described above. First-strand cDNAs were prepared from the total RNAs (1 μg samples) of mouse, rat, hamster, guinea pig and human tissues (Sawady, Tokyo, Japan) as described above. The cDNAs were subjected to PCR in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing Taq DNA polymerase (1 unit) and the following primers (1 μm). The forward and reverse primers for the amplification of rodent DCXR cDNAs were Expf and Expr, respectively, which did not amplify the cDNAs for MLCR and P26h, and the respective primers for that of human DCXR cDNA were hu-Nf and hu-Kr. cDNAs for human, mouse and rat β-actins were also amplified as internal controls with the specific primers that were obtained from Takara and Toyobo (Osaka, Japan). To prepare an antibody against murine DCXR, a peptide corresponding to positions 38–51 of the enzyme sequence was synthesized, conjugated to Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin, and injected subcutaneously into rabbits (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). In addition, a polyclonal antibody against recombinant His-tag human DCXR was also raised in rabbits. To express the (His)6-tagged human DCXR, we amplified the cDNA insert using the primers, hu-4f and hu-5r (see Table I). The obtained PCR fragments were digested with the restriction enzymes, then ligated into expression plasmids, pTrcA (Invitrogen). The recombinant enzyme was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, and purified using nickel nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The antibodies in the antisera were purified first on a protein-A column and subsequently with an affinity column cross-linked with the corresponding peptide or recombinant protein (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The anti-mouse DCXR antibody specifically reacted with the mouse and rat DCXRs, whereas the anti-human DCXR antibody cross-reacted with the DCXRs of human and all the rodent species. The tissues of mice, rats, hamsters and guinea pigs were homogenized with 4 volumes of 0.25 m sucrose at 4 °C, and the homogenates were centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant fractions (each comprising 20 μg of protein) and the other human tissue samples (each comprising 40 μg of protein, CLONTECH) were subjected to Western blot analysis (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using the above antibodies The kidneys removed from Sprague-Dawley rats (20 weeks, male) and BALB/c mice (10 weeks, female) were fixed in neutralized 10% (v/v) formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 3 μm. For immunohistochemistry, these sections were stained by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method (23Hsu S.M. Raine L. Fanger H. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1981; 75: 816-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). The primary and secondary biotinylated antibodies for DCXR staining were the anti-mouse DCXR antibody (10 μg/ml in PBS) and a goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (IgG) antibody (10 μg/ml, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), respectively. The sections were incubated with the primary antibody for 16 h at 4 °C, then with the secondary antibody for 1 h at RT, and with avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h. The peroxidase activity was visualized with the AEC Chromogen kit (Sigma Immunochemicals) and counterstained with hematoxylin. For immunofluorescence microscopy, the primary and secondary antibodies for DCXR staining were the same as those used in the immunohistochemistry. Subsequently the sections were incubated with Cy2-labeled streptavidin (100×, Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Buckinghamshire, UK) for 1 h. For double immunofluorescence microscopy, AGEs were stained using a mouse monoclonal anti-AGE antibody (2 μg/ml, Clone 6D12, Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) and Cy2-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (10 μg/ml, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) as the primary and secondary antibodies, respectively, while DCXR was stained with the Cy3-labeled streptavidin (100×, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Stained sections were examined using the Axiolan2 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Under anesthetization with ether, C57BL/6 mice were flushed with PBS from the left ventricle to remove the blood, immediately perfused for fixation with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 0.2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 msodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3, for 30 min. The kidneys were dissected out and immersed in the same fixative for 1 h at 4 °C. The fixed samples were embedded in LR white resin. Then 70-nm Ultrathin sections were incubated at RT with the anti-mouse DCXR antibody (5 μg/ml in PBS) for 1.5 h, and subsequently with 10-nm gold-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (×50 dilution in 1% bovine serum albumin-Tris buffered saline, British Biocell International, Cardiff, UK) for 2 h. The sections were stained with uranyl acetate and examined by a transmission electron microscope, Model H-7500 (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Control staining was conducted by using normal rabbit IgG (5 μg/ml). The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE on 12.5% (w/v) slab gels (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and analytical gel filtration on a Superdex 200 HR column (14Nakanishi M.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) were carried out as described previously. Protein sequence determination of the peptides derived by digestion of the purified liver enzymes with lysylendopeptidase was performed as described in Ref. 11Sato K. Inazu A. Yamaguchi S.

In the initial stage of this study, the aim of the cloning scheme was to isolate genes potentially involved in the major renal functions or highly expressed in the kidney, in an attempt to screen potential renal therapeutic target genes. Therefore, candidate genes were screened from a cDNA library prepared from the tissue fractions enriched in glomeruli and renal tubules of C57BL/6 mouse kidney. The library was composed of relatively short 3′-directed DNA fragments (theoretical average size, 256 base pairs) generated by MboI digestion of the cDNA to ensure its non-biased complexity. Following large-scale DNA sequencing of about 1,000 cDNAs, the library was found to contain 958 clones, three of which were from a cDNA species that has not been reported. The cDNA contained a 735-bp open reading frame, in which a polypeptide of 244 amino acids with a molecular weight of 25,744 Da is encoded (Fig. 1). We designated the protein as DCXR based on its enzymatic characteristics described below. To investigate whether other mammalian kidneys contain DCXR, we analyzed sequences deposited in the EST division of the GenBankTM data base, and found several human (AF113123) and rat (AI16935 and BI283134) EST sequences similar to the cDNA for mouse DCXR. Because the human EST sequences corresponded to both 5′- and 3′-noncoding regions of the mouse DCXR cDNA, primers were designed to anneal the non-coding regions of human DCXR cDNA, and the cDNA (806 bp) was isolated by RT-PCR and RACE from the human kidney mRNA preparation. RT-PCR with the primers, Expf and Expr, amplified cDNA fragments of about 735-bp from the total RNA of rat kidney, and the sequence (879 bp) of the full-length cDNA for rat DCXR was determined by 3′- and 5′-RACE with the gene-specific primers (Table I).

Mutations in helix 4 or helix 6 of the apoA-I reduced efflux by 79 and 51%, respectively, without substantially altering receptor binding (apparent Kd values of 1.1–4.4 μg of protein/ml). SR-BI with an M158R mutation bound poorly to rHDL with WT and helix 4 mutant apoA-I; the helix 6 mutant restored tight binding to SR-BI(M158R) (Kd values of 48, 60, and 7 μg of protein/ml, respectively). SR-BI(M158R)-mediated cholesterol efflux rates, normalized for binding, were high for all three rHDLs (71–111% of control). In contrast, absolute (12–19%) and binding-corrected (24–47%) efflux rates for all three rHDLs mediated by SR-BI with Q402R/Q418R mutations were very low. We propose that formation of a productive complex between apoA-I in rHDL and SR-BI, in which the lipoprotein and the receptor must either be precisely aligned or have the capacity to undergo appropriate conformational changes, is required for efficient SR-BI-mediated cholesterol efflux. Some mutations in apoA-I and/or SR-BI can result in high affinity, but non-productive, binding that does not permit efficient cholesterol efflux.

Lipidol. 2000; 11: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). It is clear that the ability of SR-BI to mediate selective lipid uptake from HDL plays a role in HDL metabolism in rodents. Although the physiologic significance of SR-BI-mediated efflux of cholesterol out of cells remains to be determined, analysis of this efflux has provided important insights into the properties of SR-BI and the mechanisms underlying its ligand binding and lipid transport activities. It appears that SR-BI-mediated transport of lipids between cells and lipoproteins involves two sequential steps as follows: 1) lipoprotein binding and 2) binding-dependent, yet distinct, SR-BI-mediated lipid transfer (23Gu X. Kozarsky K. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29993-30001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Although it has been proposed that SR-BI-mediated efflux of cholesterol from cells to HDL might occur as a consequence of SR-BI-mediated changes in the structure of the cell membrane and be independent of HDL binding to the receptor (48Llera-Moya M. Rothblat G.H. Connelly M.A. Kellner-Weibel G. Sakr S.W. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 575-580PubMed Google Scholar), compelling evidence that HDL binding to SR-BI is required for SR-BI-dependent efflux has appeared (23Gu X. Kozarsky K. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29993-30001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The two-step nature of SR-BI activity raised the question of whether distinct features of the structures of apoA-I or SR-BI were responsible for each of these steps and if only certain “productive” modes of apoA-I/HDL binding to SR-BI were compatible with efficient lipid transfer. Would it be possible using in vitro mutagenesis to identify residues in apoA-I or SR-BI that, when altered, would block one step (e.g. lipid transfer) but not the other (e.g. ligand binding)? In the current study, we have examined the receptor binding properties and the cholesterol efflux capacity of discoidal PC/cholesterol/apoA-I rHDL particles prepared with either unaltered (wild-type, WT) or mutant apoA-I. ApoA-I with double point mutations in charged residues either in helix 4 (D102A/D103A) or helix 6 (R160V/H162A) were used. These residues were mutated because they have been proposed to participate in interhelical interactions of antiparallel apoA-I molecules in discoidal rHDL particles (49Segrest J.P., Li, L.

Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1221-1239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar)) of apoA-I that precede helix 4 and helix 6 of apoA-I, respectively. We expected that disruption of these interhelical charge interactions or elimination of the charge of the surface amino acid exposed to the aqueous phase might alter the nature of the interactions between apoA-I and SR-BI. In addition to studying the effects of these mutations in apoA-I on the interactions of rHDL with wild-type SR-BI, we examined rHDL binding and cholesterol efflux from transfected cells expressing mutated forms of SR-BI that have defects in binding and mediating lipid transfer either to both HDL and LDL (ldlA[M158R]) or to spherical plasma HDL particles but not to plasma LDL (ldlA[Q402R/Q418R]) (23Gu X.

The results support a model in which efficient SR-BI-mediated lipid transfer depends on productive binding of apoA-I to the receptor. Nonproductive binding interactions are possible, but these do not support efficient lipid transfer. Our findings also provide additional support for the proposal that efficient cholesterol efflux mediated by SR-BI is dependent on HDL binding to the receptor.

Other reagents (and sources) are as follows: sodium [125I]iodide, [1,2-3H]cholesterol (1 mCi/ml, specific activity of 40–60 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences); fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, cholesterol, sodium cholate, and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-l-phosphatidylcholine (POPC); aprotinin, benzamidine, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, Triton X-100 from Sigma; dialysis tubing (Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc., Los Angeles, CA); immunoblot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, Bio-Rad Dc Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad); monoclonal anti-human apoA-I antibody 5F-6 (Ottawa Heart Institute, Ontario, Canada); anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and 3′,3′-diaminobenzidine or enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences); peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-human apoA-I antibody (Biodesign International Inc., Saco, ME). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was purchased from Qiagen Inc. (Hilden, Germany). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma, Bio-Rad, or other standard commercial sources as described previously (14Liadaki K.N. Liu T., Xu, S. Ishida B.Y. Duchateaux P.N. Krieger J.P. Kane J.

To generate baculoviruses expressing wild-type and mutant apoA-I forms, a BamHI-SalI fragment containing human apoA-I cDNA was cloned into the polylinker region of pFASTBAC donor plasmid that contains the ampicillin and gentamycin resistance genes (Invitrogen). This recombinant plasmid also contains a histidine tag and the Tobacco Etched viral (TEV) protease cleavage site. The apoA-I-containing plasmid was used to transform DH10Bac Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen). These cells had been transformed previously with the baculovirus genome containing the lacZ and kanamycin resistance genes, along with a helper plasmid containing the tetracycline resistance gene and the transposase genes. Transposition of the apoA-I gene into the lacZ gene disrupts the expression of lacZ and provides a recombinant plasmid named bacmid. The generation of the donor plasmid expressing WT apoA-I was described previously (14Liadaki K.N. Liu T., Xu, S. Ishida B.Y. Duchateaux P.N. Krieger J.P. Kane J. Krieger M. Zannis V.I. J. Biol.

For the generation of AI(D102A/D103A) and AI(R160V/H162A), the human apoA-I cDNA was mutagenized by PCR, using a set of specific mutagenesis primers, containing the mutation of interest, and a set of flanking universal primers containing the restriction sites BamHI and SalI, using the pBluescript-AI cDNA plasmid as template. For the mutagenesis of AI(D102A/D103A), 5′ (AIMIV1–5) and 3′ (AIMIV1–3) primers were used. For the mutagenesis of AI(R160V/H162A), 5′ (AIMIV4–5) and 3′ (AIMIV4–3) primers were used. The set of universal primers are 5′ (AIWC-5) and 3′ (AIWC-3) (see Table I) (53Karathanasis S.K. Salmon E. Haddad I.A. Zannis V.I. Scanu A.M. Spector A.A. Biochemistry and Biology of Plasma Proteins.

For the generation of apoA-I(Δ(185–243)), the region between amino acids +1 and +184 was amplified using the 5′ (AIC-5) and 3′ (AIM3–3) primers, respectively (see Table I). The DNA fragment containing the mutation of interest was digested with BamHI and SalI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pFASTBAC donor plasmid. Cells containing recombinant bacmids were selected by kanamycin, tetracycline, and gentamycin resistant as white colonies due to the disruption oflacZ sequence in the recombinant bacmid. Recombinant bacmid DNA was isolated from minipreps and used to transfect a monolayer of Sf-9 insect cells (54Luckow V.A. Lee S.C. Barry G.F. Olins P.O. J.

Recombinant viruses were isolated, amplified, titrated, and used to infect larger Sf-9 cell cultures grown in suspension at 27 °C. Sf-9 cells were pelleted and resuspended in a lysis buffer. The supernatant was used for the purification of apoA-I fusion proteins using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin affinity chromatography (57Crowe J. Masone B.S. Ribbe J. Methods Mol.

The solvent was evaporated under nitrogen. After drying, the lipids were suspended in buffer A (10 mmTris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, and 1% sodium EDTA (w/w), pH 8.0) by vortexing and held on ice for 1 h. Then sodium cholate (the final cholate/POPC molar ratio was 1) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h on ice. The appropriate amount of apolipoprotein was then added, followed by an hour-long incubation on ice.

We report here that this protein modification is not a simple response to the cellular redox state, since different oxidants lead to different patterns of proteinS-thiolation. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is the major target for modification following treatment with hydroperoxides (hydrogen peroxide or tert-butylhydroperoxide), whereas this enzyme is unaffected following cellular exposure to the thiol oxidant diamide. Further evidence that protein S-thiolation is tightly regulated in response to oxidative stress is provided by the finding that the Tdh3 GAPDH isoenzyme, and not the Tdh2 isoenzyme, isS-thiolated following exposure to H2O2 in vivo, whereas both GAPDH isoenzymes are S-thiolated when H2O2 is added to cell-free extracts. This indicates that cellular factors are likely to be responsible for the difference in GAPDH S-thiolation observed in vivo rather than intrinsic structural differences between the GAPDH isoenzymes. To begin to search for factors that can regulate theS-thiolation process, we investigated the role of the glutaredoxin family of oxidoreductases. We provide the first evidence that protein dethiolation in vivo is regulated by a monothiol-glutaredoxin rather than the classical glutaredoxins, which contain two active site cysteine residues.

Sulfydryl (-SH) groups play a remarkably broad range of roles in the cell, with their redox state affecting the activity and structure of many enzymes, receptors, and transcription factors. As a result, all organisms contain complex regulatory machinery to maintain the redox states of -SH groups in both proteins and low molecular weight sulfydryls (reviewed in Refs. 1.Carmel-Harel O. Storz G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 439-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 2.Grant C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 3.Rietsch A. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 163-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, cysteine residues are among the most easily oxidized residues in proteins, and oxidation can result in intermolecular protein cross-linking and enzyme inactivation, eventually leading to cell death (4.Coan C. Ji J.-Y. Hideg K. Mehlhorn R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Such irreversible oxidation events can be prevented by protein S-thiolation, in which protein -SH groups form mixed disulfides with low molecular weight thiols such as GSH (5.Thomas J.A. Poland B. Honzatko R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 6.Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). A variety of proteins that become S-thiolated in response to cellular stress have been detected in mammalian cells. These include key metabolic enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase, glycogen phosphorylase, creatine kinase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 1The abbreviations used are: GAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseNEMN-ethylmaleimideDTTdithiothreitol glutathione transferase, and superoxide dismutase as well as structural and transport proteins such as hemoglobin, actin, and crystallin (reviewed in Ref. 6.Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Studies have also suggested that this modification may be involved in the regulation of the function and activity of proteins, including the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease (7.Davis D.A. Newcomb F.M. Starke D.W. Ott D.E. Mieyal J.J. Yarchoan R. J. Biol.

Martinez-Galisteo E. Barcena J.A. Lamas S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). There does not appear to be any one unifying feature of the proteins that becomeS-thiolated apart from their relative abundance in mammalian cells. Not all -SH-containing proteins are thiolated in response to an oxidative stress, and the specificity of this protein modification indicates that it must be a tightly regulated process. However, the exact role of thiolation in protection against reactive oxygen species-mediated damage is unknown, as are the consequences of this process on cell growth and metabolism. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase N-ethylmaleimide dithiothreitol Recent studies in yeast have shown that protein S-thiolation is important for survival during exposure to oxidative stress conditions. The basal levels of S-thiolation are maintained at low levels, but they are increased following treatment with hydrogen peroxide (10.Grant C.M. Perrone G. Dawes I.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). GAPDH was identified as the major target of proteinS-thiolation following exposure to H2O2 (11.Grant C.M. Quinn K.A. Dawes I.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2650-2656Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This protein modification to GAPDH is tightly regulated, since, despite a high degree of sequence homology (98% similarity, 96% identity), the Tdh3, but not the Tdh2 GAPDH isoenzyme was S-thiolated. Furthermore, activity of both the Tdh2 and Tdh3 GAPDH isoenzymes was reduced following exposure to H2O2, but only Tdh3 activity was restored within a 1-h recovery period, indicating that S-thiolation of the Tdh3 polypeptide was readily reversible. This protein modification was also shown to be physiologically important, since mutants lacking TDH3 showed increased sensitivity to a challenge with H2O2, indicating that theS-thiolated Tdh3 polypeptide is required for survival during conditions of oxidative stress. In contrast, the nonthiolated Tdh2 polypeptide was required for survival during exposure to continuous low levels of oxidants, conditions in which the Tdh3 polypeptide wasS-thiolated and hence inactive. These findings supported a model in which both enzymes are required for survival during conditions of oxidative stress, playing complementary roles depending on their ability to undergo S-thiolation (11.Grant C.M. Quinn K.A. Dawes I.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2650-2656Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Taken together, these previous studies indicate that proteinS-thiolation is a novel form of post-translational modification regulating protein activity in response to growth or other cellular signals. Protein S-thiolation must therefore be reversible, and in vitro studies have shown that dethiolation can occur via direct reduction by GSH as well as enzymatically via both glutaredoxins and thioredoxins (5.Thomas J.A. Poland B. Honzatko R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 12.Jung C.-H. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Glutaredoxin appears to be the most active dethiolase, and in addition, a recent study has shown a correlation between protein-SSG reduction and glutaredoxin activity in mammalian cells (13.Chrestensen C.A. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26556-26565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the factors regulating this protein modification in vivo. In this study, we provide the first in vivoevidence that protein dethiolation can be catalyzed by a monothiol-glutaredoxin rather than the classical glutaredoxins, which contain two active site cysteine residues. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are described in Table I. The doublegrx3::kanMX4 grx5::kanMX4 andgrx4::kanMX4 grx5::kanMX4 mutant strains were constructed using standard yeast genetic methods. Strains were grown in rich YEPD medium (2% (w/v) glucose, 2% (w/v) bactopeptone, 1% (w/v) yeast extract) or minimal SD medium (0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 5% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, 2% (w/v) glucose) supplemented with appropriate amino acids and bases: 2 mmleucine, 4 mm isoleucine, 1 mm valine, 0.3 mm histidine, 0.4 mm tryptophan, 1 mm lysine, 0.15 mm adenine, 0.2 mmuracil. Media were solidified by the addition of 2% (w/v) agar. Sensitivity to oxidants was determined by growing cells to exponential phase in SD medium at 30 °C and treating with the required oxidant. Aliquots of cells were diluted into fresh YEPD medium and plated in triplicate on YEPD plates to obtain viable counts after 3 days of growth.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeReference/SourceCY4MATa ura3–52 leu2–3, 112 trp1–1 ade2–1 his3–11 can1–100Ref. 21.Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T.

Briefly, cells were grown in minimal SD medium to an A 600 of 1 (1–2 × 107 cells/ml) and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) to remove any traces of growth medium and resuspended in ice-cold 8 mmHCl, 1.3% (w/v) 5-sulfosalicyclic acid. Cells were broken with glass beads using a Minibead beater (Biospec Scientific, Bartlesville, OK) for 30 s at 4 °C before incubating on ice for 15 min to precipitate proteins. Cell debris and proteins were pelleted in a microcentrifuge for 15 min (13,000 rpm, 4 °C), and the supernatant was used for the determination of free glutathione. The analysis of proteinS-thiolation in yeast has been described previously (11.Grant C.M. Quinn K.A. Dawes I.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2650-2656Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells were grown to exponential phase in minimal SD medium and treated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide for 15 min to inhibit cytoplasmic protein synthesis. The intracellular pool of low molecular weight sulfydryls was radiolabeled by incubating cells with ∼0.5 nml-[35S]cysteine/methionine for 1 h. Cells were then washed and resuspended in fresh SD medium with oxidants to induce S-thiolation. Cell-free extracts were prepared in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, by breaking cells with glass beads using a Minibead Beater for 30 s at 4 °C. Parallel extracts were prepared in buffer containing either 50 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) to prevent thiolation during the sample preparation, or 25 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) to reduce anyS-thiolated proteins. To follow dethiolation, cells were resuspended in fresh SD medium containing 50 μg/ml cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis. To quantify proteinS-thiolation, aliquots of cell extracts were precipitated on Whatman GF/C glass microfiber filters using 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Radioactive incorporation was measured by scintillation counting and S-thiolation expressed as the difference between the NEM- and DTT-treated extracts (cpm/μg of protein). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized using a Typhoon 8600 Imaging system (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification on gels was performed using ImageQuant Solutions software (Amersham Biosciences), and S-thiolation was again expressed as the difference between the NEM- and DTT-treated extracts. GAPDH activity was measured according to McAlister and Holland (14.Mcalister L. Holland M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15019-15027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and expressed as μmol of NADH formed per min per μg of protein. Protein extracts were electrophoresed under reducing conditions on 10% SDS-PAGE minigels and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The blot was incubated in 2 μg/ml anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody (MAB374; Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA). Bound antibody was visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) following incubation of the blot in rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). To characterize the effects of oxidative stress induced by different oxidants on protein S-thiolation, the intracellular pool of low molecular weight sulfydryls was radiolabeled as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were challenged with 2 mm H2O2,tert-butylhydroperoxide, or diamide, and cell extracts were prepared in the presence of NEM to prevent S-thiolation during the extraction procedure or with DTT to reduce anyS-thiolated proteins. The levels of proteinS-thiolation were quantified as the difference in counts incorporated between the NEM- and DTT-prepared extracts (Fig. 1 A). The basal level ofS-thiolation in unstressed cells was very low but increased following treatment with all three oxidants. H2O2 and tert-butylhydroperoxide caused a similar increase in protein S-thiolation, whereas that from diamide was much lower. To determine the number and range of proteins that areS-thiolated following treatment with the different oxidants, total cell extracts were examined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B). As expected from the radioactive counts, few S-thiolated proteins were detected in unstressed cells, whereas, several proteins were detected following exposure to oxidants. Treatment with 2 mm H2O2 ortert-butylhydroperoxide induced a similar pattern of proteinS-thiolation. In both cases, a prominent protein of ∼38 kDa was detected, which we have previously identified as GAPDH (11.Grant C.M. Quinn K.A. Dawes I.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2650-2656Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition, several unknown proteins were S-thiolated in response to both oxidants (e.g. of 45, 70, and 100 kDa). These unknown proteins were also detected following treatment with diamide, but surprisingly, diamide did not induce proteinS-thiolation of GAPDH. Radioactivity incorporation was confirmed to occur as a result of S-thiolation, since it was reversed by treatment with DTT. These results confirm that proteinS-thiolation is tightly regulated in the cell and indicate that different oxidant treatments result in different patterns of modification. To determine whether this difference inS-thiolation arose as a result of the oxidants having different effects on the cellular oxidation state, we determined whether the increases in protein S-thiolation levels correlated with changes in the cellular redox state. Glutathione is the most abundant low molecular weight sulfydryl, and differences in the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) can be used as a sensitive indicator of the overall redox balance (15.Meister A.

Exponential phase yeast cells grown under normal aerobic conditions have a high glutathione redox ratio, indicating that most glutathione is maintained in a reduced (GSH) form (16.Grant C.M. MacIver F.M. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17.Muller E.G.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Treatment with both 2 mmH2O2 and tert-butylhydroperoxide reduced the GSH/GSSG ratio, but to different extents (Fig. 2 B). H2O2 treatment at this concentration did not increase the levels of GSSG, but it decreased GSH by ∼40% (Fig. 2 A), reducing the GSH/GSSG ratio from 188 in the control culture to 137. In contrast, tert-butylhydroperoxide elevated GSSG levels by approximately 6-fold, reducing the GSH/GSSG ratio to 32. Diamide, which is a membrane-permeable thiol-specific oxidant (18.Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), readily oxidized glutathione, resulting in a greater than 40-fold increase compared with the control culture (Fig. 2 A). This caused a much reduced GSH/GSSG ratio (4.8), indicating that ∼15% of the total free glutathione was present in an oxidized form following treatment with diamide (Fig. 2 B). Thus, protein S-thiolation did not correlate with changes in the cellular redox state, since the diamide treatment caused a large reduction in the cellular redox balance but only a small increase in the levels of S-thiolation compared with the other oxidants. In addition, there was no correlation between the levels of proteinS-thiolation and cell viability. Treatments with 2 mm tert-butylhydroperoxide or diamide did not affect viability (Fig. 2 C), whereas 2 mmH2O2 resulted in greater than 90% loss of cell viability within 1 h. Thus, protein S-thiolation is a regulated process that occurs in response to particular stress conditions. In order to identify the processes responsible for this regulation, we next examined protein S-thiolation of GAPDH as a model protein. Three unlinked genes (TDH1, TDH2, and TDH3) encode isoenzymes of GAPDH in yeast (19.McAlister L. Holland M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15013-15018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the Tdh3 isoenzyme, but not the Tdh2 isoenzyme, is S-thiolated in response to oxidative stress (11.Grant C.M. Quinn K.A. Dawes I.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2650-2656Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This difference inS-thiolation between the Tdh2 and Tdh3 polypeptides might arise due to differences in their structures that affect the accessibility of sulfydryl groups to S-thiolation, or alternatively, the difference might be due to trans-acting factors that regulate the process in the cell. To discriminate between these two possible mechanisms, we examined the ability of Tdh2 and Tdh3 to beS-thiolated in vitro. Specifically, the pool of low molecular weight sulfydryls was radiolabeled in the wild-type strain and in the tdh1 tdh2 and tdh1 tdh3mutants. No S-thiolation was detected in the absence of oxidative stress (Fig. 3 A, -H 2 O 2 lanes). Treatment of cells with H2O2 resulted inS-thiolation of GAPDH in strains containing Tdh3 (wild type and tdh1 tdh2) but not in strains that lacked Tdh3 (tdh1 tdh3), confirming that Tdh3 is theS-thiolated isoenzyme of GAPDH (Fig. 3 A, +H 2 O 2 lanes). Cell-free extracts were prepared from the nonstressed strains and treated with 1 mm H2O2 for 30 min at 30 °C in vitro (Fig. 3 B). NoS-thiolation was detected in the unstressed extracts, but GAPDH was S-thiolated in response to treatment with H2O2 in extracts from all three strains. Radiolabeling was confirmed to occur as a result ofS-thiolation, since it was reversed by treatment with DTT. Thus, unlike the situation found in cells (Fig. 3 A), Tdh2 as well as Tdh3 can be S-thiolated in vitro (Fig. 3 B). This indicates that cellular factors are likely to be responsible for the differences in GAPDH S-thiolation observed in vivo rather than differences in structure between the GAPDH isoenzymes. To begin to search for possible trans-acting factors that might regulate the S-thiolation process, we next examined protein S-thiolation in mutants lacking glutaredoxins. We have previously identified two genes, designated GRX1 andGRX2, in yeast that encode glutaredoxins (20.Luikenhuis S. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 9: 1081-1091Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Mutants lacking GRX1 and GRX2 were unaffected in mixed disulfide formation (20.Luikenhuis S. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 9: 1081-1091Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and similarly, S-thiolation of GAPDH is unaffected in grx1 and grx2 mutants (data not shown). Recently, a new family of glutaredoxin-related proteins has been identified in yeast (GRX3–5) that is conserved throughout evolution from bacterial to mammalian species (21.Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In addition, Grx5 was found to play an important role in protection against oxidative damage (21.Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). These glutaredoxin-like proteins differ from classical glutaredoxins in that they contain a single cysteine residue at their putative active sites. Thus, they would be able to reduce protein-mixed disulfides in a reaction that proceeds via a monothiol mechanism (21.Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 22.Bushweller J.H. Aslund F. Wuthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the role of Grx5 in protein S-thiolation by determining its effect on GAPDH enzyme activity. The wild-type and grx5mutant strains were grown to exponential phase and treated with 2 mm H2O2 to induce proteinS-thiolation (Fig. 4). Prior to the peroxide treatment, the basal level of GAPDH activity in thegrx5 mutant was ∼10-fold higher than in the wild-type strain. Following treatment with H2O2, GAPDH activity was inhibited by ∼60 and 89% in the wild-type andgrx5 mutant strain, respectively (Fig. 4 A). This reduction in GAPDH activity may have arisen due to irreversible oxidation or S-thiolation of the enzyme active site, both of which would inhibit GAPDH activity. To distinguish between these two possibilities, cells were transferred into fresh SD medium to follow the recovery of GAPDH activity once the H2O2 stress was removed. In the wild-type strain, GAPDH activity recovered within 20 min to ∼90% of the basal level, before the oxidant treatment. In contrast, GAPDH activity in thegrx5 mutant was only restored to 30% of the control activity during a 60-min recovery period, indicating that Grx5 is required for efficient dethiolation of S-thiolated GAPDH. The differences in GAPDH activity did not arise due to changes in protein levels. In agreement with the measured enzyme activity, GAPDH protein was elevated in the grx5 mutant compared with the wild-type strain. In addition, Western blot analysis showed that differences in protein levels between the untreated, H2O2-treated, and recovery extracts could not account for the changes in GAPDH activity detected (Fig. 4 B). To further investigate the role of Grx5 in protein S-thiolation, cells in which the pools of low molecular weight thiols had been radiolabeled were challenged with H2O2 at concentrations between 1 and 4 mm for 30 min (Fig. 5). Protein synthesis in the BY4742 strain background appears to be somewhat more resistant to cycloheximide than the CY4 strain. This was seen as the incorporation of label that could not be reversed by DTT and was therefore due to protein synthesis rather than protein S-thiolation. A peak of GAPDH S-thiolation was seen in the wild-type strain at a concentration of 1 mm H2O2. In contrast, significantly higher levels of proteinS-thiolation were detected in the grx5 mutant at all concentrations of H2O2 tested. In particular, S-thiolation of GAPDH was very prominent, and there was elevated S-thiolation of several unknown proteins with approximate sizes of 30, 45, 60, 70, and 100 kDa. To examine the role of Grx3–5 in dethiolation, wild-type and glutaredoxin mutant cells were radiolabeled and treated with 2 mmH2O2 for 30 min to induceS-thiolation. Cells were washed to remove the H2O2 and any unincorporated radiolabel and resuspended in fresh minimal SD medium to follow the dethiolation process (Fig. 6). In the wild-type strain, dethiolation of GAPDH was ∼80% complete within 5 min. In contrast, dethiolation of GAPDH was significantly slower in thegrx5 mutant compared with the wild-type strain and was only 50% complete after a 10-min recovery period (p < 0.001). However, dethiolation did occur in the grx5 mutant and was complete within 20 min. These results indicate that Grx5 is required for the efficient dethiolation of GAPDH, but other factors can also catalyze the reaction. These other factors do not appear to be Grx3 or Grx4, since dethiolation of GAPDH occurred with similar kinetics to the wild-type strain in a grx3 and agrx4 mutant (data not shown). To further examine the roles of Grx3 and Grx4, dethiolation was examined in grx3 grx5 andgrx4 grx5 double mutant cells (Fig. 6 B). Loss ofGRX3 or GRX4 in the grx5 mutant had little or no effect on dethiolation, which was still complete within the 20-min recovery period. To determine whether glutaredoxins 3–5 are required to maintain the cellular redox state, the levels and redox ratio of glutathione were measured ingrx3–5 mutants (Table II). Previous work has shown that glutathione is unaffected ingrx1 or grx2 mutants (20.Luikenhuis S. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 9: 1081-1091Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Similarly, strains lacking GRX3 or GRX4 contained levels of GSH and GSSG that were comparable with the wild type, resulting in a redox ratio of ∼140 (Table II). In contrast, the grx5 mutant contained approximately 4-fold higher levels of GSSG, which resulted in a lowered GSH/GSSG redox ratio of 46. The treatment with 2 mm H2O2 for 30 min, which was used to induce protein S-thiolation in previous experiments (Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6), did not affect the wild-type strain but caused a small increase in GSSG (27%) and decrease in the GSH redox ratio (17%).Table IILoss of GRX5 lowers the glutathione redox ratioStrainGSH2-aData are the means of triplicate experiments.GSSG2-aData are the means of triplicate experiments.GSH/GSSGnmol/ml/ODpmol/ml/ODWild type2.65 ± 0.4519.1 ± 5.9139Wild type + H2O22-bThe wild type (BY4742) and grx5 mutant were treated with 2 mm H2O2 for 30 min.2.37 ± 0.5817.1 ± 6.9138grx33.47 ± 0.2423.9 ± 3.6145grx43.05 ± 0.3923.1 ± 6.4132grx53.30 ± 0.3971.6 ± 25.546grx5 + H2O22-bThe wild type (BY4742) and grx5 mutant were treated with 2 mm H2O2 for 30 min.3.46 ± 0.4491.1 ± 27.0382-a Data are the means of triplicate experiments.2-b The wild type (BY4742) and grx5 mutant were treated with 2 mm H2O2 for 30 min. Open table in a new tab It has long been recognized that low molecular weight thiols, such as GSH, can interact in a reversible manner with the cysteine -SH groups in many cellular proteins (6.Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 23.Cotgreave I.A. Gerdes R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In particular, proteinS-thiolation/dethiolation is a dynamic process that occurs in cells under physiological conditions as well as following exposure to an oxidative stress (5.Thomas J.A. Poland B. Honzatko R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 24.Thomas J.A. Chai Y.-C. Jung C.-H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25.Seres T. Ravichandran V. Moriguchi T. Rokutan K. Thomas J.A. Johnston R.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1973-1980PubMed Google Scholar). Models have been proposed in which the modification of proteins by S-thiolation does not require an enzymatic activity but proceeds via the reaction of partially oxidized protein sulfydryls (thiyl radical or sulfenic acid intermediates) with thiols such as cysteine or GSH or by thiol/disulfide exchange reactions with the oxidized disulfide form of glutathione (GSSG) (5.Thomas J.A. Poland B. Honzatko R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). However, the tight control of GAPDHS-thiolation described in this present study indicates that cellular factors must regulate the modification of Tdh3. The Tdh2 and Tdh3 GAPDH isoenzymes share extensive sequence homology (98% similarity, 96% identity), particularly in the regions surrounding their active site cysteine residues (14.Mcalister L. Holland M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15019-15027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.McAlister L. Holland M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15013-15018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the Tdh3, and not the Tdh2 isoenzyme, is reversibly S-thiolated following exposure to H2O2. In contrast, both GAPDH isoenzymes could be S-thiolated in vitro using cell-free extracts. Thus, there do not appear to be any intrinsic structural differences to account for the difference in protein-mixed disulfide formation between the two GAPDH isoenzymes. Our studies also show thatS-thiolation of GAPDH is a specific response to particular oxidants, since it is not increased in response to oxidative stress induced by treatment with diamide. This was despite the fact that diamide readily shifts the cellular redox balance to a more oxidized state and induces the S-thiolation of other unknown proteins. Therefore, S-thiolation in yeast is a controlled process that is regulated by specific cellular factors. The factors that are responsible for the differential S-thiolation of Tdh2 and Tdh3 remain to be identified. To protect protein -SH groups against irreversible oxidation or to serve an enzyme-regulatory function, protein S-thiolation must be readily reversible. Many studies have demonstrated thatS-thiolated proteins formed during oxidative stress are readily dethiolated once the stress is removed (25.Seres T. Ravichandran V. Moriguchi T. Rokutan K. Thomas J.A. Johnston R.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1973-1980PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Schuppe I. Moldeus P. Cotgreave I.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 1757-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27.Schuppe-Koistinen I. Gerdes R. Moldeus P. Cotgreave I.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, the reduction of mixed disulfides is stimulated by both NADH- and NADPH-dependent systems (27.Schuppe-Koistinen I. Gerdes R. Moldeus P. Cotgreave I.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28.Miller R.M. Park E.M. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 287: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), but the physiological electron donors have not been identified. Most studies investigating the factors controlling dethiolation have been performed in vitro using radiolabeled protein-mixed disulfides as substrates. These studies have implicated various oxidoreductases including those of the GSH/glutaredoxin and thioredoxin systems (12.Jung C.-H. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 29.Yoshitake S. Nanri H. Fernando M.R. Minakimi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Glutaredoxin appears to be the most efficient dethiolase enzyme in these in vitro experiments. In addition, a correlation has been demonstrated between protein-SSG reduction and glutaredoxin activity in mammalian cells (13.Chrestensen C.A. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26556-26565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and the reversible S-glutathiolation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease can be catalyzed by a glutaredoxin in vitro (7.Davis D.A. Newcomb F.M. Starke D.W. Ott D.E. Mieyal J.J. Yarchoan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25935-25940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the role of yeast glutaredoxins in protein S-thiolation. Yeast contains two classical glutaredoxin genes, designatedGRX1 and GRX2, whose protein products share 40–52% identity and 61–76% similarity with those from bacterial and mammalian species (20.Luikenhuis S. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 9: 1081-1091Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Additionally, a family of glutaredoxin-related proteins has been identified in yeast (encoded by GRX3–5), which is conserved throughout evolution (21.Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). These glutaredoxin-like proteins differ from Grx1 and Grx2 in that they contain a single cysteine residue at their putative active sites. Thus, they would be unable to substitute for glutaredoxins or thioredoxins as disulfide reductases with substrates like ribonucleotide reductase that require a dithiol mechanism (22.Bushweller J.H. Aslund F. Wuthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, they could reduce protein-mixed disulfides in a reaction that proceeds via a monothiol mechanism (21.Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar,22.Bushweller J.H. Aslund F. Wuthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, our studies show that Grx5 is required for dethiolation in vivo and can reduce mixed disulfides formed by GAPDH and other S-thiolated proteins. In contrast, the dithiol glutaredoxins (Grx1, Grx2) are not affected in the formation of mixed disulfides (20.Luikenhuis S. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 9: 1081-1091Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar) as well as in theS-thiolation/dethiolation of GAPDH (data not shown). Similarly, strains lacking GRX3 or GRX4 are unaffected in the protein S-thiolation/dethiolation process. This study shows that the grx5 mutant contains higher levels of S-thiolated Tdh3 compared with the wild-type strain following exposure to 1 mm H2O2. Western blot analysis shows that the grx5 mutant contains higher levels of GAPDH protein, so it is possible that the amount of thiolation per molecule of GAPDH may be the same between thegrx5 mutant and the wild-type strain. However, it seems unlikely that elevated levels of GAPDH protein can account for the increased GAPDH thiolation observed in the grx5 mutant in response to higher levels of H2O2 (2 and 4 mm). The level of Tdh3 S-thiolation peaks at 1 mm H2O2 in the wild-type strain, whereas thiolation is elevated at concentrations of 2 and 4 mm in the grx5 mutant. In addition, the levels of thiolation for several unknown proteins are elevated in thegrx5 mutant compared with the wild-type strain, consistent with a role for Grx5 in dethiolation. Loss of GRX5 results in a delayed recovery of GAPDH enzyme activity following oxidant treatment, with only a 2-fold recovery detected in the grx5 mutant following a 1-h growth period. In contrast, although the grx5 mutant shows a slower rate of Tdh3 dethiolation, it is still complete within a 20-min recovery period. This difference presumably reflects the presence of three GAPDH isoenzymes in yeast, of which only Tdh3 can be protected against irreversible oxidation by protein S-thiolation. Thus, dethiolation of the Tdh3 isoenzyme in the grx5 mutant would account for the limited recovery of GAPDH activity observed. Oxidation of the Tdh1 and Tdh2 isoenzymes will result in irreversible oxidation. Given that the grx5 mutant is extremely sensitive to oxidative stress (21.Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), these nonthiolated isoenzymes are likely to be readily inactivated. Thus, simply dethiolating Tdh3 in thegrx5 mutant does not restore GAPDH activity to the basal levels found prior to the oxidative stress within a 1-h time period. It is also interesting to note that GAPDH protein levels are elevated in the grx5 mutant, and this may arise in a mechanism where GAPDH synthesis is increased to compensate for any oxidized, and hence inactivated, GAPDH that may be formed. Loss of GRX5 results in extremely slow growth and elevated levels of protein oxidative damage compared with strains lackingGRX1–GRX4 (21.Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that the cellular redox balance is also shifted toward a more oxidized form (measured as GSH/GSSG) in a grx5 mutant, whereas it is unaffected by the loss of GRX1–GRX4. Thus, GRX5 appears to be the most important glutaredoxin for protection against oxidative stress. However, the synthetic lethality described for a grx2 grx5and grx3 grx4 grx5 mutant indicates that there must be some overlapping functions shared by the different glutaredoxins (21.Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Although this study has indicated a role for Grx5 in the dethiolation of protein-mixed disulfides, other activities must be required, since the reduction of S-thiolated GAPDH can still proceed. In addition, there may also be enzymes that regulate the forwardS-thiolation reaction. Mammalian glutaredoxins have been shown to catalyze both the formation and reduction of mixed disulfides (30.Ruoppolo M. Lundstrom-Ljung J. Talamo F. Pucci P. Marino G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12259-12267Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, yeast glutaredoxins do not appear to be required forS-thiolation, since mixed disulfides are formed ingrx1–grx5 mutants in response to oxidative stress. Other enzymes that regulate protein S-thiolation may represent already known factors involved in the maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis or as yet unidentified activities. Yeast will provide an ideal model system to search for these factors, given the genetic and biochemical tractability of the organism as well as the ready availability of null mutants.

Activin transduces its signal via heteromeric complexes composed of two different serine/threonine kinase receptors, termed type I and type II (6Tsuchida K. Vaughan J.M. Wiater E. Gaddy-Kurten D.

Upon ligand binding, the type II receptor transphosphorylates and activates the type I receptor kinase at the membrane region. Then, the type I receptor cytoplasmic domain interacts with intracellular signaling molecules, Smads, which regulate transcription of selected genes in a cell-specific manner (9Mathews L.S. Endocr.

However, it is speculated that there are specific roles of the ActRIIs in activin signaling. For example, the serine/threonine kinase domains of ActRIIs are constitutively activated, and ActRIIs exist as homooligomers (probably homodimers) even in the absence of ligands (11Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19013-19018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These data suggest the existence of a strict monitoring mechanism for type II receptor kinase activity. Furthermore, multiple forms of ActRIIs exist; two subtypes of activin type II receptors, ActRIIA and ActRIIB, each of which is encoded by individual genes, are known (13Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 973-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar,14Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cheifetz S. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 68: 97-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Several alternative splicing variants have also been found in each subtype (14Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cheifetz S.

For example, activin type IIA-N receptor, a splicing product of ActRIIA, is specifically expressed in neural cells and is thought to mediate neuronal-specific activin action. In a previous report, we noted the identification of a PDZ protein called activin receptor-interacting protein 1 (ARIP1), which contains five PDZ domains and two WW domains and interacts specifically with ActRIIA among the receptors for the TGF-β family (17Shoji H. Tsuchida K. Kishi H. Yamakawa N. Matsuzaki T. Liu Z. Nakamura T. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5485-5492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). ARIP1 is a scaffolding protein that unites activin receptors with an intracellular signaling molecule, Smad, and thereby regulates activin-mediated signaling in neuronal cells. These findings clearly indicate that a delicate regulation of the functions of the ActRIIs is important for maintenance of proper activin signaling. In this study, we report the identification of a novel cytoplasmic protein, which we named activin receptor-interacting protein 2 (ARIP2), by a yeast two-hybrid screening using the cytoplasmic region of the ActRIIA as bait. Different from ARIP1, ARIP2 has only a single PDZ domain and specifically interacts with ActRIIA and ActRIIB by the PDZ domain. More importantly, expression of ARIP2 enhances endocytosis of ActRIIs and suppresses activin-induced transcription. Furthermore, we found that RalBP1 interacts with the COOH-terminal region of ARIP2 and makes a ternary complex with ActRIIs and ARIP2 in vivo. Because RalBP1 is a downstream molecule of Ral and regulates endocytosis of EGF and insulin receptors (18Nakashima S. Morinaka K. Koyama S. Ikeda M. Kishida M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kishida S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3629-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), we examined whether Ral and RalBP1 regulate ARIP2-mediated endocytosis of ActRIIs. We were able to show that Ral signaling regulates ARIP2-mediated endocytosis of ActRIIs. ARIP2 interacts with ActRIIs and RalBP1 simultaneously. RalBP1 associates with POB1, which forms a complex with EGF receptor pathway substrate 15 (Eps15), Eps15-interacting protein (Epsin), adapter complex 2, and clathrin to regulate endocytosis of EGF and insulin receptors (18Nakashima S.

Therefore, we proposed that ARIP2 is a scaffolding PDZ protein that unites ActRIIs and the regulatory proteins for endocytosis and controls activin-mediated signaling. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin; Wako, Osaka, Japan), and CHO-K1 cells were maintained in minimum essential α medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. The anti-ActRIIA and anti-ActRIIB polyclonal antibodies were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The anti-RalBP1 and anti-GAL4 polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-FLAG (M2) antibody was from Sigma. The anti-C-Myc (9E11) antibody was from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA). The anti-HA polyclonal antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using a commercially available system (Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System 2; CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol (17Shoji H.

Approximately 4 × 106clones of a mouse brain cDNA library constructed in pAct2 (CLONTECH) were screened using bait constructs, pAS-ActRIIA, which contained the nucleotide sequences for the entire cytoplasmic region of mouse ActRIIA (17Shoji H.

To obtain a full-length cDNA for ARIP2, a mouse brain cDNA library in the λZAPII vector (STRATAGENE, La Jolla, CA) was screened using a fragment of ARIP2 as the probe. One clone covering the full-length cDNA of ARIP2 was identified. DNA constructs for the yeast two-hybrid screening were made using the plasmid pAS2-1 to express the fusion protein with the GAL4 DNA binding domain. pAS-ActRIIA was made by introducing a cytoplasmic region of mouse ActRIIA into pAS2-1, as described previously (17Shoji H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5485-5492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). pAS-ARIP2 was made by introducing nucleotides 127–588 of ARIP2 into pAS2-1. DNA constructs for the mammalian two-hybrid assay were made using the plasmid pBIND to express the fusion protein with the GAL4 DNA binding domain and using pACT to express the fusion protein with the VP16 activation domain (17Shoji H.

In pBIND-ActRIIAΔΕSSL and pBIND-ActRIIBΔESSI, four amino acid residues of ActRIIA and ActRIIB COOH terminus, respectively, were deleted. To make pACT/pBIND-ARIP2 and pACT/pBIND-ARIP2ΔC, cDNA fragments composed of nucleotides 127–588 and 127–426 of ARIP2, respectively, were prepared by PCR and ligated into pACT and/or pBIND. DNA constructs for pACT-RalBP1-(499–647) and pcDNA3-RalBP1-(499–647) were made by introducing a cDNA fragment composed of amino acid 499–647 of RalBP1 (23Cantor S.B. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4578-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) into pACT and pcDNA3. Expression constructs of ARIP2 were made by subcloning nucleotides 127–588 of ARIP2 into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). A series of deletion mutants of ARIP2 was made by assembling PCR-generated fragments. pcDNA3-ARIP2ΔPDZ, lacking the PDZ domain, contained nucleotides 226–588, and pcDNA3-ARIP2ΔC, lacking the COOH-terminal region, contained nucleotides 127–426 of ARIP2. To make the glutathione S-transferase-Ral binding domain of RalBP1 (GST-RalBD), cDNA covering amino acids 391–499 of rat RalBP1 (23Cantor S.B. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4578-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified with specific primers harboring the BamHI site at 5′ terminus and the EcoRI site at 3′ terminus and cloned into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). pCGN-HA-RalB, pCGN-RalBG23V, pCGN-RalBS28N, pBJ-Myc-RalBP1, pBJ-Myc-RalBP1-(364–647), pBJ-HA-POB1 were as described (19Ikeda M.

The 5′ and 3′ junctional regions between the insert and the vector of each construct were sequenced to ensure that the inserts were introduced properly. Mammalian two-hybrid assay was performed using CheckMate mammalian two-hybrid system (Promega, Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer's protocol (17Shoji H. Tsuchida K. Kishi H. Yamakawa N.

In brief, CHO cells were cotransfected with the plasmids of interest, a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven β-galactosidase and a reporter plasmid, pG5luc, which drives the luciferase gene under the control of GAL4-responsive promoter. Luciferase activity was measured and normalized to the β-galactosidase activity as described previously (6Tsuchida K. Vaughan J.M. Wiater E. Gaddy-Kurten D. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5493-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were cotransfected with indicated plasmids using TransFast liposome reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two days after transfection, COS-7 cells were harvested in a lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysate was centrifuged, and the protein concentration of each supernatant was determined by Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). Proteins (200 μg) were mixed with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, supernatants were incubated with the primary antibody by slow rotation at 4 °C overnight and mixed with protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed three times with the lysis buffer. The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Then, the membranes were incubated with indicated antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL;Amersham Biosciences). To show the endogenous association of ARIP2 and ActRIIs, mouse liver was homogenized in 5 volumes of homogenization buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.2), 5 mm benzamide-HCl (pH 7.2), 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate) and centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Next, the pellet was resuspended in five volumes of the homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was lysed in a lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-ActRIIA, anti-ActRIIB, or anti-ARIP2 antibody. The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Then the membranes were probed with the anti-ARIP2 antibody. To study the endogenous association of ARIP2, ActRIIs, and RalBP1, mouse brain lysate was prepared as above and immunoprecipitated with either anti-ActRIIA or anti-ActRIIB. The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Then the membranes were probed with either anti-ARIP2 or anti-RalBP1 antibody. To make polyclonal anti-ARIP2 antibodies, GST fusion proteins of COOH-terminal ARIP2 (nucleotides 427–588) were purified and used for immunization of New Zealand White rabbits. ARIP2-specific antisera were purified by passing through protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and used for immunoprecipitation. Northern blot filter with 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from various adult mouse tissues (mouse Multiple Tissue Northern blot, CLONTECH) was hybridized with cDNA probe containing either a full-length (nucleotides 127–850) or the COOH-terminal fragment (427–850) of ARIP2. Each probe was made by PCR from ARIP2 cDNA. Hybridization, washing, and detection were performed as described previously (17Shoji H. Tsuchida K. Kishi H. Yamakawa N. Matsuzaki T. Liu Z. Nakamura T. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5485-5492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The CAGA-lux construct has been described previously (26Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). CAGA-lux, cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase, and various amounts of either pcDNA3-ARIP2, pcDNA3-ARIP2ΔPDZ, or pcDNA3-ARIP2ΔC were introduced into CHO-K1 cells using TransFast liposome reagent. Stimulation by activin and measurement of luciferase activity were performed as described previously (6Tsuchida K. Vaughan J.M. Wiater E. Gaddy-Kurten D. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5493-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with the indicated plasmids using TransFast liposome reagents. To examine the surface activin binding activity of the cells, transfected cells were washed three times with cold binding medium (minimum essential α medium containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated in 800 μl of cold binding medium containing 15 ng of125I-activin A for the indicated time periods on ice. Then unbound ligands were removed by washing three times with cold PBS(−), the cells were solubilized in 1 n NaOH, and the radioactivities of the cells were counted in a γ counter. To study the internalization of ActRIIs, transfected cells were washed three times with binding medium and incubated in 800 μl of binding medium containing 15 ng of 125I-activin A at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for the indicated time periods. After incubation, the plates were placed on ice, washed three times with cold PBS(−), and then incubated with cold acid washing buffer (0.2 m acetic acid and 0.5 m NaCl) for 5 min on ice. Then the cells were washed three times with cold PBS(−) and solubilized in 1 nNaOH, and the radioactivities of the lysates were counted in a γ counter. Cell-associated radioactivity after the acid wash represented internalized ActRIIs during incubation at 37 °C. The amount of surface ActRIIs was determined by incubating the cells in 800 μl of cold binding medium with 15 ng of 125I-activin A for 4 h on ice followed by three washes with cold PBS(−). Internalization of ActRIIs was determined as the ratio of internalized ActRIIs/surface ActRIIs. Nonspecific binding and internalization activities were determined in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled activin A. CHO-K1 cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with indicated plasmids by TransFast liposome reagent. The next day coverslips were fixed and permeabilized as described previously (17Shoji H. Tsuchida K. Kishi H. Yamakawa N. Matsuzaki T. Liu Z. Nakamura T. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5485-5492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The cells were double-immunostained with goat anti-ActRIIA antibody to detect ActRIIs and FLAG-ARIP2 or FLAG-ARIP2ΔC. Then the cells were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies. Fluorescent images of the cells were captured using a confocal microscope (Zeiss 510). For purification of GST-RalBD, protein expression was induced in BL21 protease-negative bacteria strain using 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside-treated bacteria were collected and lysed in ice-cold PBS(−) containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. The lysate was sonicated 3 times for 20 s and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min to remove insoluble material. Cleared lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), and GST-RalBD protein was eluted from the beads in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm glutathione. The eluted protein was dialyzed for 20 h in the same buffer without glutathione. The GTP-bound form of Ral was isolated using GST-RalBD and subsequently quantified, as previously described (27Wolthuis R.M. Franke B. van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells were transfected with pCGN-HA-RalB and then 1 day after transfection were serum-starved for 24 h. The cells were then treated with or without 50 ng/ml activin A for the indicated time periods and lysed in Ral binding buffer (10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants of each sample were adjusted to the same protein concentration with Ral binding buffer in a final volume of 0.5 ml. Samples were incubated with 15 μg of GST-RalBD precoupled with glutathione beads and incubated for 2 h with rotation at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times in Ral binding buffer, and the precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were then probed with anti-HA antibody. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we searched for proteins that specifically interacted with the cytoplasmic region of ActRIIA. Thirty candidate clones were obtained and sequenced. In a previous study, we reported the characterization of one of the proteins, called ARIP1. ARIP1 is a large protein that has two WW domains and five PDZ domains and is able to associate with ActRIIA and Smad (17Shoji H. Tsuchida K. Kishi H. Yamakawa N. Matsuzaki T. Liu Z. Nakamura T. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5485-5492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this study, a clone encoding a novel PDZ protein was selected. We refer to the protein as ARIP2. A full-length cDNA for ARIP2 was isolated by screening mouse brain cDNA libraries. A full-length cDNA clone composed of 862 bp was obtained (Fig. 1 A). The ARIP2 cDNA encoded a protein of 153 amino acids and contained a single PDZ domain in the NH2-terminal region. Data base searches for ARIP2-related sequences revealed the presence of a highly homologous sequence in expressed sequence tags in human tissue, which is likely to be a human counterpart of ARIP2 (Fig. 1 B). In a previous study (17Shoji H. Tsuchida K. Kishi H. Yamakawa N. Matsuzaki T. Liu Z. Nakamura T. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5485-5492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) we reported that ActRIIs have a class I consensus PDZ binding motif at the COOH-terminal region and have an ability to interact with a PDZ protein, ARIP1. We first tested by immunoprecipitation assay whether the specific interaction with ActRIIs is mediated by the PDZ domain of ARIP2 in COS-7 cells. Lysates of COS-7 cells cotransfected with FLAG-ARIP2 and either ActRIIA or ActRIIB were immunoprecipitated with an anti-ActRIIA or anti-ActRIIB antibody. The coimmunoprecipitated FLAG-ARIP2 was detected by an anti-FLAG antibody. (Fig. 2 A, both of the top panels, lane 1). Similarly, FLAG-ARIP2ΔC was coimmunoprecipitated in cotransfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 2 A, both of the bottom panels, lane 1). By contrast, FLAG-ARIP2ΔPDZ was not coimmunoprecipitated in cotransfected cells (Fig. 2 A, both of the middle panels, lane 1). These data confirmed that ARIP2 interacts with ActRIIs through its PDZ domain. Because ActRIIs have consensus PDZ binding motifs at COOH-terminal regions, we next tested the interaction of COOH-terminal deletion mutants of ActRIIs with ARIP2 by mammalian two-hybrid assay. As shown in Fig. 2 B, ARIP2 did not interact with mutated ActRIIs that lacked the COOH-terminal ESSL (ActRIIA) or ESSI (ActRIIB). Thus, the COOH-terminal amino acids of the receptors are required for the association of ActRIIs with ARIP2. Thus, we concluded that the PDZ domain of ARIP2 interacts with the COOH-terminal regions of ActRIIs, which have consensus PDZ binding motifs. In a mammalian two-hybrid assay, ARIP2 interacted with both ActRIIA and ActRIIB. By contrast, ARIP2 did not show interaction with either TGF-β type II receptor or bone morphogenetic protein type II receptor (Fig. 2 B). In addition, ARIP2 also interacted with kinase-deficient ActRIIA and ActRIIB (data not shown). Because ActRIIA and ActRIIB expressed at approximately the same level (Fig. 2 B, inset), The relative level of interaction of ARIP2 with ActRIIB is weaker than that with ActRIIA. We did not detect any association of ARIP2 with any type I family of receptor serine/threonine kinases (data not shown). These results indicate that ARIP2 interacts specifically with ActRIIs among serine/threonine kinase receptors for the TGF-β superfamily and suggest that ARIP2 may have specific roles in the activin signaling. To determine whether ARIP2 interacts with ActRIIs in a native environment, we performed immunoprecipitation of ARIP2 from a detergent-soluble extract of mouse liver lysate. As shown in Fig. 2 C, either anti-ActRIIA or anti-ActRIIB antibody coimmunoprecipitated ARIP2, which migrates approximately at 28 kDa, whereas the control IgGs did not"
https://openalex.org/W2012181614,"The Na+/H+exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF) binds through its PDZ1 domain to the carboxyl-terminal sequences NDSLL and EDSFL of the β2adrenergic receptor (β2AR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, respectively, and plays a critical role in the membrane localization and physiological regulation of these receptors. The crystal structures of the human NHERF PDZ1 domain bound to the sequences NDSLL and EDSFL have been determined at 1.9- and 2.2-Å resolution, respectively. The β2AR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor ligands insert into the PDZ1 binding pocket by a β-sheet augmentation process and are stabilized by largely similar networks of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. In the PDZ1-β2AR complex, the side chain of asparagine at position −4 in the β2AR peptide forms two additional hydrogen bonds with Gly30 of PDZ1, which contribute to the higher affinity of this interaction. Remarkably, both complexes are further stabilized by hydrophobic interactions involving the side chains of the penultimate amino acids of the peptide ligands, whereas the PDZ1 residues Asn22 and Glu43 undergo conformational changes to accommodate these side chains. These results provide structural insights into the mechanisms by which different side chains at the position −1 of peptide ligands interact with PDZ domains and contribute to the affinity of the PDZ-ligand interaction. The Na+/H+exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF) binds through its PDZ1 domain to the carboxyl-terminal sequences NDSLL and EDSFL of the β2adrenergic receptor (β2AR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, respectively, and plays a critical role in the membrane localization and physiological regulation of these receptors. The crystal structures of the human NHERF PDZ1 domain bound to the sequences NDSLL and EDSFL have been determined at 1.9- and 2.2-Å resolution, respectively.

NHERF, also known as ezrin/radixin/moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50 or EBP50 (2Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J.

Through these interactions, NHERF plays central roles in the membrane targeting, trafficking, and sorting of several ion channels, transmembrane receptors, and signaling proteins (reviewed in Ref.4Shenolikar S.

The PDZ1-mediated interaction of NHERF with the carboxyl-terminal motif DTRL of CFTR is essential for the functional expression in the apical plasma membrane and gating of the CFTR channel, and the mutations that destroy this motif result in abnormal apical polarization of CFTR and defective vectorial chloride transport (8Moyer B.D.

A. 2001; 98: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Likewise, the binding of the NHERF PDZ1 domain to the β2AR carboxyl-terminal sequence NDSLL is essential for the β2AR-mediated regulation of Na+/H+ exchange (6Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Grinstein S. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). This interaction also mediates the sorting of internalized β2AR between degradative endocytic pathways and plasma membrane recycling; the truncation of the β2AR carboxyl terminus prevents NHERF PDZ1 binding and leads to lysosomal degradation of the receptor (10Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Importantly, the phosphorylation of the serine within the β2AR sequence NDSLL (Ser411 in the full-length receptor) by the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-5 inhibits the NHERF PDZ1-β2AR interaction and regulates β2AR endocytic sorting (10Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). In addition, the NHERF PDZ1 interacts with the motif EDSFL, which is present at the carboxyl termini of PDGFR forms A and B, and potentiates PDGFR autophosphorylation and extracellular signal-induced kinase activation (5Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 7Maudsley S. Zamah A.M. Rahman N. Blitzer J.T. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8352-8363Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Notably, a single mutation of the PDGFR carboxyl-terminal leucine to alanine abolishes binding to NHERF PDZ1 and impairs the receptor activity, demonstrating the critical role of this interaction in PDGFR function (7Maudsley S. Zamah A.M. Rahman N. Blitzer J.T. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8352-8363Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are protein-protein interaction modules that participate in the assembly of membrane receptors, ion channels, and other signaling molecules into specific signal transduction complexes (11Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 12Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These domains bind to short carboxyl-terminal sequence motifs and were initially grouped into two classes based on target sequence specificity. Class I domains bind to peptides with the consensus sequence (S/T)X(V/I/L) (X denoting any amino acid), whereas class II domains recognize the motif (F/Y)X(F/V/A) (13Songyang Z. Fanning A.S., Fu, C., Xu, J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). However, other PDZ domains have ligand sequence specificities that do not fall into these two categories, suggesting the existence of more PDZ classes (11Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 12Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Peptide ligands interact with PDZ domains by a β-sheet augmentation process in which the peptide adds an antiparallel β-strand to the preexisting PDZ β-sheet (23Harrison S.C. Cell. 1996; 86: 341-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The specificity of the PDZ-ligand interaction is achieved by the residues at positions −3, −2, and 0 of the peptide (position 0 referring to the carboxyl-terminal residue) (11Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 12Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, initial biochemical and structural studies indicated that the residue at position −1 of the peptide ligand plays no role in the interaction with PDZ domains (13Songyang Z. Fanning A.S., Fu, C., Xu, J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 14Doyle D.A. Lee A.

Biol. 1998; 5: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies demonstrated a strong preference of PDZ domains for specific side chains at position −1, suggesting an important role of these side chains in the PDZ-ligand interaction (17Schultz J. Hoffmuller U. Krause G. Ashurst J. Macias M.J. Schmieder P. Schneider-Mergener J. Oschkinat H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 24Fuh G.

Guggino W.B. Li M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In the case of NHERF, affinity selection experiments showed that PDZ1 selected almost exclusively ligands with arginine at position −1 from random peptides (25Wang S. Raab R.W. Schatz P.J. Guggino W.B. Li M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and mutagenesis of the penultimate arginine to other residues decreased the affinity of the PDZ1-ligand interaction (5Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). A structural explanation for this preference was provided by the crystal structure of the human NHERF PDZ1 domain complexed with the CFTR carboxyl-terminal sequence QDTRL (22Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Ladias J.A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19683-19686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this structure, the guanidino group of arginine at position −1 of the CFTR peptide forms two salt bridges and two hydrogen bonds with PDZ1 residues Glu43 and Asn22, respectively, thus contributing to the affinity of the PDZ1-ligand interaction. This finding led to the hypothesis that PDZ residues corresponding to the hNHERF PDZ1 Asn22 and Glu43 may play a more general role in the interaction with the penultimate residues of the peptide ligands (22Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Ladias J.A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19683-19686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the crystal structures of hNHERF PDZ1 bound to the carboxyl-terminal sequences NDSLL and EDSFL of β2AR and PDGFR, respectively. The structures provide new insights into the mechanisms by which hydrophobic side chains at position −1 interact with this domain, contributing to the affinity of the interaction, and reveal the conformational changes that the PDZ1 residues Asn22 and Glu43 undergo to accommodate these side chains. A DNA fragment encoding the human NHERF PDZ1 domain (residues 11–94) and having the carboxyl-terminal extension N95DSLL99 that corresponds to residues 409–413 of human β2AR was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction and cloned in the vector pGEX-2TJL (22Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Ladias J.A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19683-19686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A similar strategy was used to generate the hNHERF PDZ1 domain (residues 11–94) having the carboxyl-terminal extension E95DSFL99 that corresponds to residues 1085–1089 and 1102–1106 of human PDGFRA and PDGFRB, respectively. The resulting chimeric PDZ1-β2AR and PDZ1-PDGFR domains were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin and released from the glutathione S-transferase moiety by digestion with thrombin as described previously (21Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Birrane G. Webster G. Ladias J.A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PDZ1-β2AR protein (19 mg/ml) was crystallized using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method in 0.1 m citric acid, pH 4.24, and 1 m lithium chloride at 20 °C, whereas PDZ1-PDGFR (18 mg/ml) was crystallized in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 2 m sodium chloride at 20 °C. Both crystals were cryoprotected in 20% (v/v) glycerol for 3 min and flash-frozen in a stream of liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data sets were collected at 115 K using CuKαradiation from a Rigaku RU-300 generator and an R-AXIS IV-imaging plate detector. The data were processed and scaled using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38252) Google Scholar) (Table I). Both crystals belong to space group P3121 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit and unit cell parameters: a = b = 50.37 Å,c = 66.63 Å (for PDZ1-β2AR) and a = b = 50.07 Å, c = 66.68 Å (for PDZ1-PDGFR).Table IStatistics of structure determination and refinementPDZ-β2ARPDZ-PDGFRData Collection Resolution (Å)26.5–1.926.4–2.2 Total reflections64,23151,504 Unique reflections8,0694,958 Overall Completeness (%)99.895.1 Rsym(%)1-aRsym = Σ‖ (I − 〈I〉) ‖/Σ(I) where I is the observed integrated intensity, 〈I〉 is the average integrated intensity obtained from multiple measurements, and the summation is over all observed reflections.0.0590.090 Redundancy5.43.4 Average (I/ς(I))23.411.8 Outer shell (Å)1.97–1.902.28–2.20 Completeness (%)99.785.6 Rsym (%)0.1940.360 Redundancy4.92.1 Average (I/ς(I))8.42.9Refinement Resolution (Å)26.5–1.926.4–2.2 Number of reflections in working set7,6934,690 Number of reflections in test set372268 Rcryst(%)1-bRcryst = Σ‖‖Fobs‖ −k‖Fcalc‖‖/Σ‖Fobs‖, where Fobs and Fcalc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively.17.122.2 Rfree(%)1-cRfree is calculated as Rcryst using 5% of the reflection data chosen randomly and omitted from the refinement calculations.18.626.3 Number of non-hydrogen protein atoms682682 Number of water molecules10655 Number of chlorine atoms42 Bond lengths1-dBond lengths and angles are root-mean-square deviations from ideal values.(Å)0.0140.016 Bond angles1-dBond lengths and angles are root-mean-square deviations from ideal values.(°)1.651.74 Average B values (Å2) Overall19.333.1 Main chain atoms16.832.8 Side chain atoms19.033.1 Solvent atoms28.234.51-a Rsym = Σ‖ (I − 〈I〉) ‖/Σ(I) where I is the observed integrated intensity, 〈I〉 is the average integrated intensity obtained from multiple measurements, and the summation is over all observed reflections.1-b Rcryst = Σ‖‖Fobs‖ −k‖Fcalc‖‖/Σ‖Fobs‖, where Fobs and Fcalc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively.1-c Rfree is calculated as Rcryst using 5% of the reflection data chosen randomly and omitted from the refinement calculations.1-d Bond lengths and angles are root-mean-square deviations from ideal values. Open table in a new tab Both structures were solved by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP (27Vagin A.A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4098) Google Scholar) and the hNHERF PDZ1 (Protein Data Bank code 1g9o) as the search model. For PDZ1-β2AR, the model was truncated by removing the last six carboxyl-terminal residues. The rotation function search in the resolution range from 20.0 to 3.0 Å produced a clear solution with a peak height of 6.53ς above the mean. The translation function indicated that the correct space group was P3121 with a correlation coefficient of 47.6% and an R-factor of 47.3%. For the structure determination of PDZ1-PDGFR, a polyalanine model of hNHERF PDZ1 was used for molecular replacement in order to remove any model bias. The rotation function in the resolution range from 20.0 to 3.0 Å produced a solution with a peak height of 6.31ς above the mean, and the translation function indicated that the space group was also P3121 with a correlation coefficient of 55.6% and an R-factor of 42.7%. Models were built using the program O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) and were refined by the maximum likelihood method using REFMAC5 (29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). Both structures are well ordered with the exception of the loop region spanning residues 31–35, which is disordered. The crystallized proteins also contained at their amino termini the vector-derived residues GSSRM from which only methionine is ordered and included in both models, whereas arginine is partially ordered and represented as a glycine in the PDZ1-PDGFR model. To determine the crystal structures of the hNHERF PDZ1 domain bound to the β2AR and PDGFR carboxyl-terminal ligands, we adopted a crystallization strategy similar to that used in the hNHERF PDZ1-CFTR structural analysis (22Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Ladias J.A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19683-19686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this approach, we crystallized the hNHERF PDZ1 domain (residues 11–94) fused to either the β2AR carboxyl-terminal sequence N95DSLL99 or the PDGFR carboxyl-terminal motif E95DSFL99 (Fig. 1A). As in the case of hNHERF PDZ1-CFTR, the hNHERF PDZ1-β2AR and hNHERF PDZ1-PDGFR crystal structures produced infinite head-to-tail polymers of PDZ1 molecules along the z axis with the carboxyl-terminal pentapeptide extension of one chimeric PDZ1 molecule serving as a ligand for a neighboring PDZ1 (Fig. 1B). Both crystal structures were solved by molecular replacement using the hNHERF PDZ1 structure (21Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Birrane G. Webster G. Ladias J.A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) as the search model. The PDZ1-β2AR structure was refined to an Rcryst of 17.1% and an Rfree of 18.6%, whereas the PDZ1-PDGFR model was refined to an Rcryst of 22.2% and an Rfree of 26.3% (Table I). An evaluation of the stereochemistry of the PDZ1-β2AR structure using PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.J. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showed that 89% of the residues are in the most favored region and 9.6% in the additional allowed regions. One residue (Ala81) is disordered and located in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. A similar analysis of the PDZ1-PDGFR model placed 87.8% of the residues in the most favored and 12.2% in the additional allowed regions. The hNHERF PDZ1 core domain consists of six β-strands (β1–β6) and two α-helices (α1 and α2) (Fig. 1, A, C, and D). The β2AR and PDGFR carboxyl-terminal sequences NDSLL and EDSFL, respectively, insert into the PDZ1 binding pocket as additional β-strands (β7) antiparallel to β2 and extend the β-sheet of PDZ1. In this arrangement, the invading pentapeptide ligands are highly ordered as indicated by the high quality electron density maps (Fig. 1, C and D) and average B factors of 13.5 Å2 for β2AR and 30.7 Å2 for PDGFR. The stabilization of the PDZ1-β2AR and PDZ1-PDGFR interactions is achieved through networks of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, which to a large extent are similar in the two protein-peptide complexes. The side chains of residues Leu 0, Ser −2, and Asp −3, which are common in both ligands, are engaged in numerous interactions with PDZ1 residues, consistent with biochemical evidence on the central role of these residues in the specificity and affinity of the NHERF PDZ1 interaction with β2AR and PDGFR (5Hall R.A.

Specifically, in both PDZ1-β2AR and PDZ1-PDGFR structures, the side chain and carboxylate group of Leu 0 enter into a deep cavity formed by Tyr24, Gly25, Phe26, Leu28, Val76, and Ile79 residues. In this position, the carboxyl oxygen of Leu 0 hydrogen bonds with the amide nitrogens of Gly25 and Phe26, whereas the carbonyl oxygen of Leu 0 hydrogen bonds directly with the amide nitrogen of Tyr24 (Fig. 2,A–D). The isobutyl group of Leu 0 is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with PDZ residues that are largely similar in both structures (Fig. 2, C and D). Moreover, in both complexes the amide nitrogen and carbonyl oxygen atoms of Ser −2 hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen and amide nitrogen of Leu28, respectively, whereas the Oγ1 atom of Ser −2 hydrogen bonds with the Nε2 atom of the conserved His72. These interactions corroborate previous studies that demonstrated the critical role of a serine or threonine at position −2 of the ligand and a histidine at the beginning of the α2 helix for the specificity of class I PDZ-peptide interactions (5Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 6Hall R.A. Premont R.T.

In the case of the β2AR ligand, the phosphorylation of Ser −2 by G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-5 has been shown to abrogate the interaction with NHERF PDZ1 and play an important role in the regulation of β2AR endocytic sorting (10Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Based on the current PDZ1-β2AR structure, it could be predicted that the added phosphoryl group on the Ser −2 would sterically clash with the imidazole group of His72, dislodging the main chain of the peptide away from the binding pocket and disrupting several hydrogen bonds that stabilize the PDZ-peptide β-sheet. As observed previously in the hNHERF PDZ1-CFTR structure (22Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Ladias J.A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19683-19686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), in both PDZ1-β2AR and PDZ1-PDGFR complexes the Oδ1atom of Asp −3 hydrogen bonds with Nδ1 of His27, the Oδ2 atom of Asp −3 forms a salt bridge with Nη1 of Arg40, and the carbonyl oxygen of the residue at position −4 hydrogen bonds with the amide nitrogen of Gly30 (Fig. 2, A–D). However, in the PDZ1-β2AR structure the Oδ1 and Nδ2 atoms of Asn −4 make two additional hydrogen bonds with the amide nitrogen and carbonyl oxygen of Gly30, respectively (Fig. 2, A and C), that contribute to the affinity of this interaction. As mentioned above, in the hNHERF PDZ1-CFTR structure, the guanidino group of Arg −1 forms two salt bridges with Oε2 of Glu43 and two hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of Asn22 (22Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Ladias J.A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19683-19686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This unexpected finding suggests that the residue −1 of the peptide plays an important role in the affinity of the PDZ-ligand interaction. It also raises the question of whether nonpolar side chains at position −1 of peptide ligands, such as the large hydrophobic side chains of the penultimate residues of β2AR and PDGFR, interact with the hNHERF PDZ1 or are disordered facing toward the solution. The present structures clearly demonstrate that both the isobutyl group of Leu −1 and the phenolic ring of Phe −1 of the β2AR and PDGFR ligands, respectively, are well ordered (Fig. 1, C and D) and engage in hydrophobic interactions with PDZ1 residues. Specifically, the Cδ1 atom of the β2AR Leu −1 contacts the Cδ2 atom of His27, whereas the Cδ1 and Cβ atoms of the PDGFR Phe −1 contact the Cδ2 and Cε1 atoms of His27, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). These results provide compelling structural evidence for the importance of the penultimate ligand residue in the affinity of the PDZ-peptide interaction. In agreement with this conclusion, the recent crystal structure of the InaD PDZ1 complexed with the carboxyl-terminal sequence of NorpA revealed the presence of an intermolecular disulfide bond formed between Cys −1 of the peptide ligand and a cysteine residue of the PDZ domain (31Kimple M.E. Siderovski D.P. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4414-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Another notable feature in the present structures is that the carbonyl oxygen atoms of the penultimate residues of both β2AR and PDGFR ligands make direct hydrogen bonds with the Nη2atom of Arg80 (Fig. 2, A and B). In this respect, the PDZ1-β2AR and PDZ1-PDGFR structures differ from that of PDZ1-CFTR where the carbonyl oxygen of Arg −1 does not hydrogen bond directly with Arg80 (22Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Ladias J.A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19683-19686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, the carbonyl oxygen of Leu 0 interacts indirectly with the Nεatom of Arg80 through two ordered water molecules in the PDZ1-β2AR and PDZ1-CFTR structures but not in the PDZ1-PDGFR complex. These findings demonstrate that the networks of hydrogen bonds and ordered water molecules participating in hydrogen bonding between the PDZ domain and the peptide differ among various ligands bound to the same PDZ domain. The ability of the hNHERF PDZ1 domain to interact with different side chains at position −1 of the peptide ligand raises the question of whether PDZ residues around the binding pocket undergo conformational changes to accommodate different ligands. The superposition of the hNHERF PDZ1 domains bound to the β2AR, PDGFR, and CFTR peptides reveals the structural differences among the three complexes and provides insights into the mechanisms underlying PDZ-ligand recognition. The three liganded hNHERF PDZ1 structures are very similar with overall root- mean-square deviations ranging from 0.53 to 0.88 Å (Fig. 2E). Larger differences in the backbone positions are observed in the β2-β3 and α2-β6 loops with root-mean-square deviation ranges of 1.13–1.98 and 1.08–1.59 Å, respectively. The main chains of the three peptide ligands and the side chains of residues at positions 0, −2, and −3 are superimposed extremely well, whereas large deviations are observed in the orientations of the side chains at position −4 (Fig. 2E). To a large extent, the side chains of Phe −1 and Leu −1 follow a path similar to that of the aliphatic portion of the Arg −1 side chain, facing toward the PDZ residues Asn22and Glu43. Notably, the side chains of these two PDZ residues exhibit the largest conformational changes seen in all three complexes. In the PDZ1-β2AR structure, the side chain of Asn22 is oriented toward the isobutyl group of Leu −1, whereas in the PDZ1-PDGFR and PDZ1-CFTR complexes, the amide group is rotated away from the longer side chains of Phe −1 and Arg −1 because of steric effects (Fig. 2E). Remarkably, the Glu43 side chain occupies three different positions for optimal ligand interaction. These findings indicate that the conformational changes of Asn22 and Glu43underlie the hNHERF PDZ1 flexibility to accommodate ligands with penultimate side chains of different hydrophobicity and polarity and suggest similar roles for the corresponding residues of other PDZ domains. This work provides the structural basis for the interaction of β2AR and PDGFR with hNHERF PDZ1 and expands our insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying peptide recognition by class I PDZ domains. The observed differences in the hNHERF PDZ1 interaction with the CFTR, β2AR, and PDGFR ligands also indicate that although PDZ domains are structurally simple protein interaction modules sharing the same fold, more biochemical and structural studies are needed to derive the structural principles governing the selection of their target peptides. From a clinical standpoint, because of the central roles of β2AR and PDGFR in human physiology and pathology, the structural determinants of the hNHERF PDZ1 interaction with these receptors may have important applications in molecular medicine. For example, this information may be used for the design of a new class of specific inhibitors of these receptors, which would act by disrupting the hNHERF PDZ1-receptor interaction and block the functional localization in plasma membrane and activity of these receptors. It was previously shown that β2AR agonists induce conformational changes in the receptor that promote a direct physical association of its carboxyl terminus to the hNHERF PDZ1 (6Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Grinstein S. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Therefore, small molecules that would block specifically the hNHERF PDZ1-β2AR interaction could act as β2AR antagonists. Likewise, the inhibitors of the hNHERF PDZ1-PDGFR interaction could be useful in reducing the mitogenic activity of this receptor in tumor cells. In this context, it is of particular interest to note that the hNHERF gene expression is rapidly activated by estrogen in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells (32Ediger T.R. Kraus W.L. Weinman E.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2976-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and estrogen receptor levels correlate closely with hNHERF expression in breast carcinomas (33Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Wiederhold T. Nielsen G.P. James M. Pinney-Michalowski D. Roy J.E. Cohen W.A. Ramesh V. Louis D.N. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 57-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), raising the intriguing possibility that hNHERF may play an important role in breast cancer development through potentiation of the PDGFR mitogenic activity (7Maudsley S.

Moreover, it was recently shown that PDGFRA is significantly up-regulated in metastatic medulloblastoma and enhances the migration properties of medulloblastoma cells, suggesting that strategies aiming at inhibiting PDGFRA function could constitute novel therapeutic approaches against medulloblastoma (34MacDonald T.J. Brown K.M. LaFleur B. Peterson K. Lawlor C. Chen Y. Packer R.J. Cogen P. Stephan D.A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that the hNHERF PDZ1-PDGFR atomic structure may provide the framework for the design of small molecules that would block this interaction and decrease the PDGFR-proliferative activity in cancer cells. 1gq41gq5"
https://openalex.org/W2018262559,"Neuronal Cdc2-like kinase (Nclk) plays an important role in a variety of cellular processes, including neuronal cell differentiation, apoptosis, neuron migration, and formation of neuromuscular junction. The active kinase consists of a catalytic subunit, Cdk5, and an essential regulatory subunit, neuronal Cdk5 activator (p35(nck5a) or p25(nck5a)), which is expressed primarily in neurons of central nervous tissue. In our previous study using the yeast two-hybrid screening method, three novel p35(nck5a)-associated proteins were isolated. Here we show that one of these proteins, called C42, specifically inhibits the activation of Cdk5 by Nck5a. Co-immunoprecipitation data suggested that C42 and p35(nck5a) could form a complex within cultured mammalian cells. Deletion analysis has mapped the inhibitory domain of C42 to a region of 135 amino acids, which is conserved in Pho81, a yeast protein that inhibits the yeast cyclin-dependent protein kinase Pho85. The Pho85.Pho80 kinase complex has been shown to be the yeast functional homologue of the mammalian Cdk5/p35(nck5a) kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2015990617,"Expression of the tryptophanase (tna) operon in Escherichia coli is regulated by catabolite repression and tryptophan-induced transcription antitermination. The key feature of this antitermination mechanism has been shown to be the retention of uncleaved TnaC-peptidyl-tRNA in the translating ribosome. This ribosome remains stalled at the tna stop codon and blocks the access of Rho factor to the tnatranscript, thereby preventing transcription termination. In normal S-30 preparations, synthesis of a TnaC peptide containing arginine instead of tryptophan at position 12 (Arg12-TnaC) was shown to be insensitive to added tryptophan, i.e.Arg12-TnaC-peptidyl-tRNA was cleaved, and there was normal Rho-dependent transcription termination. When the S-30 extract used was depleted of release factor 2, Arg12-TnaC-tRNAPro was accumulated in the absence or presence of added tryptophan. Under these conditions the accumulation of Arg12-TnaC-tRNAPro prevented Rho-dependent transcription termination, mimicking normal induction. Using a minimal in vitro transcription system consisting of a tna template, RNA polymerase, and Rho, it was shown that RNA sequences immediately adjacent to thetnaC stop codon, the presumed boxA andrut sites, contributed most significantly to Rho-dependent termination. The tna boxA-like sequence appeared to serve as a segment of the Rho “entry” site, despite its likeness to the boxA element. Expression of the tryptophanase (tna) operon in Escherichia coli is regulated by catabolite repression and tryptophan-induced transcription antitermination.

The tna boxA-like sequence appeared to serve as a segment of the Rho “entry” site, despite its likeness to the boxA element. Escherichia coli and many other Gram-negative bacteria use the enzyme tryptophanase to degrade l-tryptophan to indole, pyruvate, and ammonia (1.Kazarinoff M.N. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7598-7602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), allowing these microorganisms to utilize tryptophan as a source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy (2.Hopkins F.G. Cole S.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1903; 29: 451-466Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The tryptophanase (tna) operon of E. coli has two major structural genes, tnaA, encoding tryptophanase, andtnaB, encoding a low affinity tryptophan permease (3.Deeley M.C. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 787-796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Edwards R.M. Yudkin M.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 617-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Initiation of transcription of the tna operon is regulated by catabolite repression (5.Botsford J.L. DeMoss R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 303-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Stewart V.

Chem. 2001; 276: 1974-1983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Once initiated, continuation of transcription into the tnaA-tnaB structural gene region depends on tryptophan-induced transcription antitermination. Antitermination is achieved by some feature of induction that prevents Rho factor from terminating transcription in the leader region of the operon (5.Botsford J.L. DeMoss R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 303-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Stewart V. Landick R. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7.Gong F. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1974-1983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The tna operon contains a 319-base pair transcribed leader region upstream of the tnaA initiation codon. The transcript of this leader region bears a coding segment,tnaC, specifying a 24-residue leader peptide, TnaC, that contains a single tryptophan residue. Synthesis of TnaC is essential for induction (3.Deeley M.C. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 787-796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Stewart V. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 731-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Stewart V. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 383-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Replacing the tnaC start codon by a stop codon (9.Stewart V. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 383-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Gollnick P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3100-3107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or replacing Trp codon 12 by a codon for some other amino acid (10.Gollnick P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3100-3107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) prevents induction.Evidence supporting the essential role of Rho factor in mediating transcription termination in the tna operon leader region was provided by analyses of Rho mutants (8.Stewart V. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 731-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), examination of Rho-inhibiting drugs (11.Yanofsky C. Horn V. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4451-4456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and deletion of a leader region sequence-rich in C residues (10.Gollnick P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3100-3107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in rho that reduce Rho factor activity as well as addition of bicyclomycin, an inhibitor of Rho action, increase basal expression of thetna operon significantly (7.Gong F. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1974-1983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8.Stewart V. Yanofsky C. J.

Similarly, deletion of a 23-nucleotide C-rich tna RNA sequence immediately following the tnaC stop codon (Fig. 1 A) reduces transcription termination (10.Gollnick P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3100-3107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparable sequences, called Rho utilization (rut) sites, have been identified in Rho transcription termination studies with other systems (12.Chen C.Y. Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P. Cell. 1986; 46: 1023-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13.Richardson J.P. Greenblatt J.L. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B.

Little is known about the features of the rut site required for Rho binding other than it generally has relatively little secondary structure (15.Morgan W.D. Bear D.G. Litchman B.L. Hippel P.H.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 3739-3754Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and is rich in cytosine residues (12.Chen C.Y. Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P.

Interaction between Rho and an RNArut sequence is essential for Rho-dependent termination (17.Lau L.F. Roberts J.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 11292-11299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).An additional sequence element shown to be essential for maximum termination is located near the distal end of tnaC (8.Stewart V. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 731-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Kamath A.V. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19978-19985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence is homologous to the boxA elements found in studies with the phage λ N/nut antitermination system (20.Olson E.R. Tomich C.S. Friedman D.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,21.Roberts J.W. Cell. 1993; 72: 653-655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and with bacterial rrn operons (22.Li S.C. Squires C.L. Squires C.

A. 1993; 90: 970-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). boxA of these operons is required for prevention of Rho-dependent termination, not for facilitation of Rho-dependent termination. The N protein of phage λ relieves both Rho-dependent termination and intrinsic transcription termination (24.Gusarov I. Nudler E. Cell. 2001; 107: 437-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Several host factors called Nus factors are involved in antitermination at sites of Rho-dependent termination (21.Roberts J.W. Cell. 1993; 72: 653-655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25.Weisberg R.A. Gottesman M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 359-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, rrn boxA is the loading site for the E. coli S10 (or NusE) and NusB proteins (26.Nodwell J.R. Greenblatt J. Cell. 1993; 72: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). boxA of rrn operons appears to be sufficient to prevent Rho-dependent termination in vivo (27.Berg K.L. Squires C. Squires C.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), while in the phage λ N/nut antitermination system, boxA andboxB sequences are both required for specific N binding and subsequent formation of the RNA polymerase-N-NusA-NusB-NusG-S10-nut antitermination complex (21.Roberts J.W. Cell. 1993; 72: 653-655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25.Weisberg R.A. Gottesman M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 359-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Mogridge J.

In contrast, the boxA sequence in thetna operon does not behave like a typical boxAsequence, mutations in this presumed boxA sequence decrease rather than increase transcription termination in the tnaoperon leader region (8.Stewart V. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 731-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Attempts to detect a gene encoding a presumed trans-acting factor that is responsible for tryptophan-induced expression of thetna operon of E. coli have been unsuccessful (29.Gish K. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The findings obtained in in vivo and in vitro studies of tna operon regulation suggest that all the genetic information necessary for tryptophan-induced expression of the tna operon is located in its leader region. The in vivo regulatory features of tna operon expression have been confirmed in vitro using an S-30 system (7.Gong F. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1974-1983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Most importantly, it was shown that translation of tnaC in the presence of added tryptophan leads to the accumulation of TnaC-peptidyl-tRNAPro in the translating ribosome (7.Gong F. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1974-1983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The uncleaved TnaC-peptidyl-tRNAPro stalls the translating ribosome at the tnaC stop codon (30.Gong F. Ito K. Nakamura Y. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8997-9001Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and this stalling is believed to block Rho factor binding and action (30.Gong F. Ito K. Nakamura Y. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8997-9001Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).In this paper we show that depleting RF-2 1The abbreviations used are: RFrelease factorRNAPRNA polymeraseRTreadthroughWTwild-typeTricineN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine1The abbreviations used are: RFrelease factorRNAPRNA polymeraseRTreadthroughWTwild-typeTricineN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine from an S-30 extract results in the accumulation of uncleaved Arg12-TnaC-tRNAPro in the translating ribosome in the absence of added tryptophan. This accumulation of uncleaved Arg12-TnaC-tRNAPro prevents Rho factor action establishing that ribosome stalling at the tnaC stop codon is sufficient to eliminate Rho-mediated transcription termination. We provide additional in vitro evidence demonstrating that the RNA sequence masked by the ribosome stalled at the tnaC stop codon serves as the Rho “entry” site. Our findings suggest that thetna boxA sequence, despite its sequence similarity toboxA elements of bacteriophage λ and rrnoperons, contributes to Rho-dependent termination by serving as a segment of the Rho entry site.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we provide in vitro evidence establishing that stalling of the ribosome translating tnaCat the tnaC stop codon is sufficient to prevent Rho-dependent transcription termination in the leader region of the tna operon. We show that expression of thetna operon appears “induced” in an RF-2-depleted S-30 extract, in the absence of tryptophan, the inducer. We also show that when a normally non-inducible mutant template with a Trp → Arg replacement at position 12 of TnaC is examined in this RF-2-depleted S-30 extract, Arg12-TnaC-tRNAPro accumulates and Rho-dependent termination is prevented, presumably because the translating ribosome has stalled at tnaC stop codon. These findings are consistent with our model (Fig. 6) that the sites required for Rho binding are adjacent to the tnaC stop codon. In the absence of inducing levels of tryptophan, the ribosome translating thetnaC coding region completed synthesis of TnaC and then dissociated from the tnaC stop codon, rendering the transcript accessible to Rho. In the presence of the inducer features of the leader peptide lead to the formation of a tryptophan binding site in the ribosome, and, when tryptophan is bound, RF-2 cannot activate peptidyltransferase cleavage of the TnaC-peptidyl-tRNAPro (30.Gong F. Ito K. Nakamura Y. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8997-9001Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).Figure 6Model for tna operon regulation in E. coli. 1, in the absence of inducing levels of tryptophan the translating ribosome reaches the tnaC stop codon, RF-2-mediated TnaC-tRNAPro cleavage occurs, and the translating ribosome subsequently releases from the template. Rho factor then has access to its entry site on the transcript in the vicinity of thetnaC UGA stop codon, it contacts a paused polymerase, and causes transcription termination. 2, in the presence of inducing levels of tryptophan, the combined action of ribosome-associated uncleaved TnaC-tRNAPro and ribosome-bound tryptophan inhibits RF-2-mediated TnaC-tRNAPro cleavage. As a result, the translating ribosome stalls at the tnaC stop codon. The stalled ribosome blocks the access of Rho to its entry site on the transcript. Transcription termination is thereby prevented, and RNA polymerase continues transcription into the tnaA-tnaB coding region.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our data show that depletion of RF-2 from the S-30 extract alters the requirements for prevention of Rho factor action. In a normal S-30 extract, inducing levels of tryptophan and the nascent wild-type TnaC-peptidyl-tRNA are required to prevent Rho-dependent termination (Fig. 3). In the RF-2 depleted S-30 extract, neither inducing levels of tryptophan nor synthesis of the nascent WT TnaC is required. Thus, when the Arg12-TnaC template was tested in the RF-2-depleted S-30 extract, accumulation of 35S-labeled Arg12-TnaC-tRNAPro was observed (Fig. 2), and Arg12-TnaC-tRNAPro was shown to be associated with its translating ribosome. 3F. Gong and C. Yanofsky, unpublished data. This accumulation was correlated with prevention of Rho-dependent termination (Fig. 4). When translation of tnaC in the RF-2-depleted S-30 extract was inhibited by chloramphenicol addition, there was no inhibition of Rho-dependent termination (Fig. 3). Thus, translation of the Arg12-TnaC mutant template is required in the RF-2-depleted S-30 extract for prevention of Rho action (Fig. 4).We also show using the RF-2-depleted S-30 extract that elevated levels of tryptophan induce tna operon expression by inhibiting the action of RF-2, not RF-1. In previous studies with partially purified ribosome complexes we observed that RF-1 and RF-2 were equally effective in mediating TnaC-tRNAPro cleavage at thetnaC UGA stop codon and that tryptophan inhibited the action of both release factors (30.Gong F. Ito K. Nakamura Y. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8997-9001Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Either some factor is removed during ribosome isolation that discriminates between the different release factors or stop codon recognition is no longer necessary for release factor participation in peptidyltransferase activation in our isolated ribosome complexes.A striking characteristic of Rho-dependent transcription termination is the requirement for a specific entry site for Rho on the synthesized transcript. Binding to this site is a prerequisite for the activation of the ATPase activity of Rho. This is required for its subsequent helicase and transcription termination functions (14.Graham J.E. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20764-20769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 36.Faus I. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3510-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our data and previous findings suggest that the RNA sequence in the vicinity of tnaC stop codon constitutes the critical entry site for Rho. The previously identified boxA sequence, as well as the rut site, appear to be required for maximal Rho-dependent termination in our purified in vitro system, in the absence of Nus factors. Deletion of the 23-nucleotide rut site significantly reduced the action of Rho in vitro (Δrut, 35% RT, Fig. 5). Most importantly, deletion of both the boxA and rutsites (ΔboxA-rut, 96% RT, Fig. 5) virtually eliminated transcription termination by Rho. The tna boxA sequence, like the rut site, is rich in C residues (Fig. 1).The boxA sequence recognized in phage λ N/nutantitermination (37.Friedman D.I. Olson E.R. Cell. 1983; 34: 143-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and in rrn operon regulation (22.Li S.C. Squires C.L. Squires C. Cell. 1984; 38: 851-860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) is required for prevention of Rho-dependent termination. It has been shown that nucleotides 2–6 of both rrn and λboxAs are specifically involved in the assembly of the antitermination complex (26.Nodwell J.R. Greenblatt J. Cell. 1993; 72: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 28.Mogridge J. Mah T.F. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4143-4148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For example, the boxA 4U → G mutation impairs the ability of rrn boxA to support transcription antitermination in vivo (26.Nodwell J.R. Greenblatt J. Cell. 1993; 72: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The same mutation in λ boxA prevents the formation of the complete complex (RNA polymerase-N-NusA-NusB-NusG-S10-nut) (28.Mogridge J. Mah T.F. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4143-4148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Note thattna boxA has a C instead of U at position 4 (Fig. 1 B). Thus the resemblance of the tna boxAsequence to the classic boxA sequence may simply be coincidental. Indeed, previous in vivo studies withnusA1, nusA100, and nusE100 mutant strains (38.Ward D.F. DeLong A. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 39.Robledo R. Atkinson B.L. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) failed to detect an effect of these alterations on termination in the tna operon (34.Konan K.V. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3981-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The key role played by NusA in the phage λ N/nut (boxA+boxB) antitermination system has been documented recently (24.Gusarov I. Nudler E. Cell. 2001; 107: 437-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).In view of the importance of ribosome stalling in tna operon induction, it is obvious that coupling of translation with transcription must play a significant role in tna operon regulation as it does in trp operon regulation (40.Landick R. Carey J. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4663-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). There are two presumed hairpin structures near the 5′ end of tnamRNA (Fig. 1 C), one containing the tnaCShine-Dalgarno sequence and start codon and one formed from the very end of the tnaC coding region. It was shown previously that this latter secondary structure serves as a transcription pause structure in vitro (6.Stewart V. Landick R. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We assume there is some mechanism of disrupting the 5′ structure, allowing ribosome binding and translation initiation, and that transcription pausing at the more 3′ structure may provide the delay that achieves synchronization of transcription and translation. Thus progression of the translating ribosome may release the paused complex, allowing transcription to proceed into the downstream region. The transcribing polymerase would then pause at one or more of the multiple pause sites located between tnaC andtnaA. These pauses would provide the opportunity for Rho factor to bind to the boxA-rut site region of thetna transcript, contact a paused polymerase, and activate transcription termination. Access of Rho factor to theboxA-rut site region would depend on the rate of dissociation of the ribosome translating tnaC at thetnaC stop codon. Obviously when inducer is present the translating ribosome would not release, Rho factor could not bind, and the distal paused polymerase molecules would continue transcription into tnaA. These kinetic features essential totna operon regulation have not yet been addressed.A second basic feature of tna operon regulation that remains to be elucidated is how, under inducing conditions, synthesis of the nascent TnaC peptidyl-tRNA participates in the creation of a tryptophan binding site. Also unknown is how the presence of ribosome-bound TnaC peptidyl-tRNA and bound tryptophan prevent RF-2 activation of ribosomal peptidyltransferase activity. Answers to these questions may provide an understanding of how features of a nascent peptide are recognized by a translating ribosome (41.Lovett P.S. Rogers E.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 366-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Geballe A.P. Sachs M.S. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. 2nd Ed.

Escherichia coli and many other Gram-negative bacteria use the enzyme tryptophanase to degrade l-tryptophan to indole, pyruvate, and ammonia (1.Kazarinoff M.N. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7598-7602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), allowing these microorganisms to utilize tryptophan as a source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy (2.Hopkins F.G. Cole S.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1903; 29: 451-466Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The tryptophanase (tna) operon of E. coli has two major structural genes, tnaA, encoding tryptophanase, andtnaB, encoding a low affinity tryptophan permease (3.Deeley M.C. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 787-796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Edwards R.M. Yudkin M.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 617-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Initiation of transcription of the tna operon is regulated by catabolite repression (5.Botsford J.L. DeMoss R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 303-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Stewart V. Landick R. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7.Gong F. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1974-1983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Once initiated, continuation of transcription into the tnaA-tnaB structural gene region depends on tryptophan-induced transcription antitermination. Antitermination is achieved by some feature of induction that prevents Rho factor from terminating transcription in the leader region of the operon (5.Botsford J.L. DeMoss R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 303-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Stewart V. Landick R. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7.Gong F. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1974-1983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The tna operon contains a 319-base pair transcribed leader region upstream of the tnaA initiation codon. The transcript of this leader region bears a coding segment,tnaC, specifying a 24-residue leader peptide, TnaC, that contains a single tryptophan residue. Synthesis of TnaC is essential for induction (3.Deeley M.C. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 787-796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Stewart V. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 731-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Stewart V. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 383-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Replacing the tnaC start codon by a stop codon (9.Stewart V. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 383-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Gollnick P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3100-3107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or replacing Trp codon 12 by a codon for some other amino acid (10.Gollnick P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3100-3107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) prevents induction. Evidence supporting the essential role of Rho factor in mediating transcription termination in the tna operon leader region was provided by analyses of Rho mutants (8.Stewart V. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 731-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), examination of Rho-inhibiting drugs (11.Yanofsky C. Horn V. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4451-4456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and deletion of a leader region sequence-rich in C residues (10.Gollnick P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3100-3107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in rho that reduce Rho factor activity as well as addition of bicyclomycin, an inhibitor of Rho action, increase basal expression of thetna operon significantly (7.Gong F. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1974-1983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8.Stewart V. Yanofsky C. J.

Similarly, deletion of a 23-nucleotide C-rich tna RNA sequence immediately following the tnaC stop codon (Fig. 1 A) reduces transcription termination (10.Gollnick P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3100-3107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparable sequences, called Rho utilization (rut) sites, have been identified in Rho transcription termination studies with other systems (12.Chen C.Y. Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P.

Expression of PDR5 is positively regulated by the transcription factors Pdr1p and Pdr3p that recognize the same pleiotropic drug resistance elements (PDREs) in the PDR5 promoter. Pdr1p and Pdr3p belong to the Gal4p family of zinc cluster proteins. The function of RDR1(YOR380W), which also encodes a member of this family, is unknown. To identify target genes for Rdr1p, we have performed whole-genome analysis of gene expression with DNA microarrays. Our results show that Rdr1p is a transcriptional repressor of five genes, including PDR5. A Δrdr1 strain has increased resistance to cycloheximide, as expected from the overexpression of PDR5. In addition, the activity of a PDR5-lacZ reporter is increased in a Δrdr1 strain. All (but one) genes affected by removal of Rdr1p contain PDREs in their promoters. We tested if the effect of Rdr1p is mediated through PDREs by inserting this DNA element in front of a minimal promoter. Activity of this reporter was increased in a Δrdr1 strain.

Thus, we have identified a transcriptional repressor involved in the control of multidrug resistance. Multidrug resistance is a widespread phenomenon that allows organisms ranging from bacteria to humans to defend themselves against a variety of toxic compounds. Drug resistance is mediated through membrane-bound transporters that act as drug efflux pumps. This process has been extensively studied in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Two major classes of multidrug transporters have been identified: the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) 1The abbreviations used are: MFSmajor facilitator superfamilyABCATP binding cassetteMDRmultidrug resistanceORFopen reading framePDREpleiotropic drug resistance elementRDR1repressor of drug resistanceWTwild-type (1Goffeau A.

Members of the family of ABC transporters include Pdr5p, Snq2p, and Yor1p (2Decottignies A. Goffeau A.

Members of this family contain six highly conserved cysteines that coordinate binding to two zinc atoms to allow proper folding of the DNA binding domain. The cysteine-rich region (or zinc finger) is usually followed by a short linker sequence that bridges the zinc finger to a dimerization domain (6Schjerling P. Holmberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4599-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This domain is involved in recognition of specific DNA sequences through interaction of the zinc finger with DNA (for references see Ref. 8Schwabe J.W. Rhodes D. Nat. Struct.

For example, three binding sites called PDREs (pleiotropic drug response elements) for Pdr1p and Pdr3p have been mapped in the PDR5 promoter (10Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahe Y.

Thus, Pdr1p and Pdr3p recognize the same DNA sequences in target promoters for activation of transcription. In addition, the PDR3 promoter also contains two PDREs and is positively regulated by its own gene product and by Pdr1p (18Delahodde A. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4043-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Deletion of PDR1 or PDR3 results in increased sensitivity to drugs while a double knockout is hypersensitive to drugs. Moreover, increased drug resistance is primarily caused by mutations in PDR1 and PDR3. These mutants are hyperactive transcription factors (19Carvajal E. van den Hazel H.B. Cybularz-Kolaczkowska A.

Whole-genome analysis of gene expression with hyperactive forms of Pdr1p and Pdr3p (or a chimeric Pdr1p activator) has allowed the identification of additional targets for these transcriptional activators (21DeRisi J. van den Hazel B.

To better understand the role of these genes, we have performed a phenotypic analysis of 33 members of the family of zinc cluster proteins (7Akache B., Wu, K. Turcotte B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2181-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For example, deletion of YOR380W results in inability to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources and hypersensitivity to calcofluor white, a compound that has high affinity to chitin, a cell wall component (7Akache B., Wu, K. Turcotte B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2181-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the function and the target genes of YOR380W are unknown. To identify target genes of YOR380W, we have performed whole-genome analysis of gene expression with DNA microarrays. Our results show that a very limited number of genes have their expression altered by deletion of YOR380W. Strikingly, all the affected genes are up-regulated in the deletion strain, and they predominantly encode membrane proteins, including ABC transporters such as Pdr5p. Moreover, deletion of YOR380W results in increased resistance to cycloheximide. These data suggest that YOR380W is a transcriptional repressor; hence, it was named RDR1 for repressor of drug resistance. S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are derived from FY73 (24Winston F.

Plasmid pFA6 (26Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar)), to an A600 of 0.8–1.0, and total RNA was isolated by the hot phenol procedure (28Kohrer K. Domdey H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). RNA was further purified with Qiagen columns according to the manufacturer's protocol except that RNA was eluted for 15 min. cDNA labeling and hybridization were performed exactly as described previously (29Hemming S.A.

Custom-made yeast whole-genome microarrays (>6200 yeast ORFs) were obtained from the Microarray Center at the Ontario Cancer Institute (Toronto, Canada). Scanning and quantification were performed exactly as described (31Traven A. Wong J.M.S., Xu, D. Sopta M. Ingles C.J. J. Biol.

Briefly, chip A was hybridized with a mixture of wild-type cDNA labeled with Cy3 (=WT-Cy3) and Cy5 (=WT-Cy5); chip B, mixture of WT-Cy3 and Δrdr1-Cy5; chip C, mixture of Δrdr1-Cy3 and WT-Cy5; chip D, mixture of Δrdr1-Cy3 and Δrdr1-Cy5. The ratio of Δrdr1/WT of each ORF obtained from chips B and C were normalized with the corresponding ratio of the same ORF from chips A and D. Because each ORF is duplicated on the same chip, four ratios obtained from chips B and C were normalized individually with the four ratios obtained from chips A and D; i.e. 16 values were obtained for each ORF.

Genomic DNA was isolated according to Ref. 32Philippsen P. Stotz A. Scherf C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar. Southern and Northern blot analyses were done according to standard procedures (33Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K.

Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 1 m NaCl, 2.8× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate. The PDR16 probe was obtained by PCR using genomic DNA with the oligos CGGAATTCATATTCCTTGGTTAGCATGG and CGGAATTCGGTACTGCTTTCCGATTTTA to amplify nucleotides +731 to +1050 (relative to the ATG) of the PDR16 gene. The PDR5 probe (containing +111 to +447 bp relative to the ATG) was obtained by digesting plasmid pPCR-PDR5 (34Alarco A.M. Balan I. Talibi D. Mainville N. Raymond M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19304-19313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) with EcoRI and the fragment was gel-purified. PCR products or fragments were randomly labeled (33Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K.

The actin probe has been described elsewhere (30Hellauer K. Sirard E. Turcotte B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13587-13592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A PDR5 reporter was constructed by amplifying its promoter using genomic DNA isolated from strain YPH499 (35Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the oligos ATCGACTCGAGGTCTTCCTCTTTGATTCCA and CGGGATCCCATTTTTGTCTAAAGTCTTTCG. The PCR product was cut with XhoI and BamHI and subcloned into plasmid pSLFΔ178K, a high copy plasmid with a URA3 selection marker (36Forsburg S.L. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) cut with BamHI and XhoI to give PDR5-lacZ-2μ. The reporter contains about 1000 bp of sequences upstream of the ATG. The ATG of the promoter is used to initiate translation of the lacZ gene. A reporter for chromosomal integration was obtained by deleting 2-μm sequences by cutting with Hin dIII and re-ligating the backbone to give PDR5-lacZ-IP. The resulting plasmid was linearized by cutting at the unique ApaI site located in the URA3 marker. DNA was transformed into FY73 or FZP (Table I) and colonies selected on plates lacking uracil. Proper integration of the reporter was verified by Southern blot analysis. A low copy version of the reporter was obtained by amplifying autonomously replicating sequence and centromere sequence with oligos ATCAGACAAGCTTTTCCCCGAAAAGTGCCAC and ATGACTTAAGCTTAAAGGGCCTCGTGATACG using plasmid pRS314 (35Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. The PCR product was cut with Hin dIII and subcloned into the Hin dIII site of PDR5-lacZ-IP. The same strategy was used to generate reporters for the SNQ2 gene (using oligos ATCGACTCGAGTGGAAAAGAACGGAGACATA and CGGGATCCCATTGAATTCTCTTTACGTA). The SNQ2 reporter contains ∼700 bp of promoter sequences upstream of the ATG codon. Promoter sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. LacZ reporters containing a Pdr1p/Pdr3p binding site (or mutants) upstream of a minimal CYC1 promoter were constructed by inserting double-stranded oligos into the XhoI site of pSLFΔ178K (36Forsburg S.L. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Oligos correspond to site number 3 of the PDR5 promoter (12Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and span sequences −372 to −337 bp relative to the ATG. Reporter PDRE3-CYC1 was constructed using the oligo TCGAAAAAGAGAAATGTCTCCGCGGAACTCTTCTACGCCG and its complement TCGACGGCGTAGAAGAGTTCCGCGGAGACATTTCTCTTTT. PDRE3A-CYC1 with TCGAAAAAGAGAAATGTCTCTGCGGAACTCTTCTACGCCG and TCGACGGCGTAGAAGAGTTCCGCAGAGACATTTCTCTTTT and PDRE3B-CYC1 with TCGAAAAAGAGAAATGTCTCCGCAGAACTCTTCTACGCCG and TCGACGGCGTAGAAGAGTTCTGCGGAGACATTTCTCTTTT (mutations are underlined). PDREs are in the same orientation and were verified by DNA sequencing. Strains FY73 and FZP were transformed with reporters. Colonies were grown overnight in YPD and diluted about 500-fold in minimal medium (synthetic dextrose (37Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar)) supplemented with appropriate amino acids and adenine. β-galactosidase assays were performed with permeabilized cells (38Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Values are the average of at least 2 independent experiments performed at least in duplicate. β-galactosidase assays for integrated reporters were performed as described above except that YPD was used instead of synthetic dextrose. To identify genes regulated by Rdr1p, RNA was isolated from wild-type strain FY73 (24Winston F. Dollard C. Ricupero-Hovasse S.L. Yeast. 1995; 11: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) and a strain carrying a deletion of the putative DNA binding domain of RDR1 (7Akache B., Wu, K. Turcotte B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2181-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We then performed a whole-genome analysis of gene expression using DNA microarrays. Data were obtained on about 6000 genes and are an average of two independent experiments performed with duplicate genomes. First, we did not observe any gene whose expression was decreased more than 1.5-fold in the deletion strain (data not shown). Thus, these data strongly suggest that Rdr1p is not a transcriptional activator under the conditions tested (rich medium). On the contrary, this study revealed that five genes were overexpressed more than 2-fold in the deletion strain (Table II). Interestingly, four of these genes encode membrane-associated transporters. The strongest induction (6.3-fold) was observed with PDR5. Two other genes (PDR15 and PDR16) also involved in drug resistance were up-regulated in the absence of the zinc cluster protein encoded by RDR1. Expression of ORF YOR049C was up-regulated by a factor of 4 (Table II). The function of this (putative) ORF is unknown. However, the sequence of the ORF predicts a protein of 354 amino acids with a high probability of possessing seven transmembrane domains (data not shown). Finally, PHO84, a member of the MFS family and encoding a high affinity inorganic phosphate/H+ symporter was up-regulated in absence of Rdr1p. Thus, our results suggest that Rdr1p is a transcriptional repressor. To confirm the microarray results, we performed Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from wild-type and Δrdr1 strains (Fig. 1). PDR5 mRNA level was increased about five times in the deletion strain in close agreement with the microarray analysis. Similarly, deletion of the RDR1 gene resulted in a modest increase of PDR16 mRNA (about 2-fold), again in agreement with the results generated with microarrays. Equal loading and transfer of RNA isolated for wild-type and knockout strains was shown by the similar signals obtained with an actin probe (Fig. 1, bottom). Thus, the microarray results for PDR5 and PDR16 were confirmed by an independent method. Overexpression of ABC transporters has been shown to increase resistance to various drugs (4Koloczkowska A. Goffeau A. Drug Res. Updates. 1999; 2: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For example, overexpression of the ABC transporter encoded by PDR5 results in greater resistance to the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (39Leppert G. McDevitt R. Falco S.C. Van Dyk T.K. Ficke M.B. Golin J. Genetics. 1990; 125: 13-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Meyers S. Schauer W. Balzi E. Wagner M. Goffeau A. Golin J. Curr. Gen. 1992; 21: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 41Hirata D. Yano K. Miyahara K. Miyakawa T. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested if removal of Rdr1p results in altered sensitivity to cycloheximide as predicted from the up-regulation of PDR5 in a strain deleted of RDR1. Cells were grown overnight in rich medium, serially diluted, and spotted on plates containing cycloheximide or not (Fig. 2). Increased resistance to cycloheximide was observed in a strain carrying a deletion of the RDR1 gene as compared with the parental strain FY73 (Fig. 2, lower panel). Thus, we have identified an additional phenotype for cells lacking Rdr1p. Because deletion of RDR1 results in increased expression of genes (other than PDR5) that confer drug resistance (Table II), we tested whether the observed phenotype is mediated through PDR5 or not. We constructed two different strains: one that carries a deletion of the PDR5 gene and another that is deleted of both PDR5 and RDR1. As expected (39Leppert G. McDevitt R. Falco S.C. Van Dyk T.K. Ficke M.B. Golin J. Genetics. 1990; 125: 13-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Meyers S. Schauer W. Balzi E. Wagner M. Goffeau A. Golin J. Curr. Gen. 1992; 21: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 41Hirata D. Yano K. Miyahara K. Miyakawa T. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), deletion of PDR5 results in hypersensitivity to cycloheximide (Fig. 2, bottom). However, deletion of RDR1 in a Δpdr5 background does not result in increased resistance unlike what is observed in a wild-type background. These results strongly suggest that increased resistance to cycloheximide in a Δrdr1 strain is mainly mediated by PDR5. To determine if changes in PDR5 mRNA levels are due to altered promoter activity, we constructed a reporter containing the PDR5 promoter driving lacZ expression. The reporter was stably integrated into a wild-type strain and a strain carrying a deletion of the RDR1 gene. Cells were grown in rich medium (YPD) and assayed for β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 3). The activity was increased by about 10-fold in cells lacking Rdr1p (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). As a control, we used a gene related to PDR5, SNQ2, which also encodes an ABC transporter. According to our microarray analysis, steady-state levels for SNQ2 RNA were unchanged in cells lacking Rdr1p (data not shown). A SNQ2 reporter stably integrated in the yeast genome showed similar activity in wild-type and Δrdr1 strains (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). Similar results were obtained with low copy episomal reporters introduced into wild-type and Δrdr1 strains (Fig. 3, lanes 5–8). The activity of the PDR5 reporter was increased about 5-fold in a Δrdr1 strain whereas a SNQ2 reporter showed a slight reduction in activity. In conclusion, these results strongly suggest that Rdr1p negatively regulates the PDR5 promoter. The PDR5 promoter has been shown to contain three sites that are recognized by the transcriptional activators Pdr1p and Pdr3p (12Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The sites contain CGG triplets oriented in opposite direction (CCGCGG) forming an everted repeat (9Hellauer K. Rochon M.-H. Turcotte B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6096-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All genes (except PHO84) identified with the microarray analysis (Table II) contain DNA sequences that match the consensus Pdr1p/Pdr3p binding site in their promoters (Table III). Thus, Rdr1p may exert its repressive effect by acting on Pdr1p/Pdr3p recognition sites. To test this possibility, we inserted oligonucleotides corresponding to a Pdr1p/Pdr3p binding site (site number three in Ref. 12Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) in front of a minimal CYC1 promoter driving lacZ transcription. Insertion of a PDRE in front of a minimal CYC1 promoter greatly increased promoter activity when compared with the minimal promoter (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 3). Strikingly, activity of the PDRE3-CYC1 reporter was increased about 8-fold when assayed in a Δrdr1 strain (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4) whereas the activity of a reporter lacking the PDRE remained at basal levels (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). These results strongly suggest that the effect of Rdr1p on PDR5 transcription is mediated by the Pdr1p/Pdr3p binding site. We then assayed the activity of reporters that contain mutations in the PDRE that reduce binding of Pdr1p and Pdr3p. The mutations are located in either of the CGG triplets that are crucial for binding of Pdr3p (9Hellauer K. Rochon M.-H. Turcotte B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6096-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As expected, the activity of the mutant was reduced when tested in a wild-type background (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 7). Mutations in either CGG triplet abolished the induction observed in a Δrdr1 strain (Fig. 4, lanes 5–8). Thus, this mutant analysis further suggests that the negative effect of Rdr1p on PDR5 expression is mediated by PDREs. Rdr1p and Pdr1p/Pdr3p appear to function on highly related DNA sequences.Table IIIPdr1p/Pdr3p binding sites found in promoters of genes upregulated in a Δrdr1 strainGenePDRE sequencePositionPDR5CTCCGCGGAA−304TTCCGTGGAA−367TTCCGCGGAA−483GTCCGTGGAG−555YOR049CTTCCGCGGAA−750ATCCGCGGAA−808PDR16TTCCGCGGAG−414TCCCACGGGT−431AGCCACGGAA−485PDR15TTCCGCGGAG−371TTCCGCGGGA−434Known and putative PDREs of genes upregulated by deletion of RDR1 are listed.

This study focused on a member of the Gal4p family of transcriptional regulators, RDR1 (YOR380W). Our previous work has shown that deletion of RDR1 results in absence of growth on non-fermentable carbon sources and sensitivity to calcofluor white, a phenotype associated with cell wall defects (42Hampsey M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1099-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar,43Lussier M. White A.M. Sheraton J. di Paolo T. Treadwell J. Southard S.B. Horenstein C.I. Chen-Weiner J. Ram A.F. Kapteyn J.C.

To gain insights into the role of RDR1, we have performed whole-genome analysis of gene expression with RNA isolated from wild-type and cells lacking Rdr1p. No genes had their expression decreased by a factor of 1.5-fold or more in the Δrdr1 strain suggesting that Rdr1p is not a transcriptional activator. On the other hand, five genes had RNA levels increased by at least 2-fold in the deletion strain (Table II). Most of these genes encode membrane proteins. Microarray data were confirmed by Northern blot analysis for PDR5 and PDR16 (Fig. 1). Furthermore, deletion of RDR1 results in increased resistance to cycloheximide (Fig. 2), a phenotype expected from the increased expression of the ABC transporter Pdr5p (39Leppert G. McDevitt R. Falco S.C. Van Dyk T.K. Ficke M.B. Golin J. Genetics. 1990; 125: 13-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Meyers S. Schauer W. Balzi E. Wagner M. Goffeau A. Golin J. Curr.

Even though removal of Rdr1p results in increased expression of multidrug resistance genes other than PDR5, genetic analysis showed that the major target of Rdr1p is PDR5 with regard to cycloheximide resistance (Fig. 2). The effect of Rdr1p is likely to be at the transcriptional level, because a PDR5-lacZ reporter mimicked the activity observed for the endogenous gene. For example, increased activity of the PDR5 promoter was observed with both integrated and episomal lacZ reporters when assayed in a strain deleted of RDR1 (Fig. 3). This effect was specific, because no increase in reporter activity was observed with a SNQ2 reporter when tested in a Δrdr1 background. Consensus target DNA sequences for Pdr1p/Pdr3 are found in all (but one) promoters of genes identified in our analysis (Table III). Therefore, we focused on this DNA element. A reporter consisting of a minimal CYC1 promoter under the control of a single PDRE shows increased activity in absence of Rdr1p (Fig. 4). Thus, the DNA sequences involved in activation by Pdr1p/Pdr3p and repression by Rdr1p are the same or overlap. Moreover, PDRE mutants with decreased binding to Pdr3p (9Hellauer K. Rochon M.-H. Turcotte B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6096-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (and presumably Pdr1p) do not show increased activity in the absence of Rdr1p. In summary, our studies strongly suggest that Rdr1p acts through Pdr1p/Pdr3p binding sites. However, many genes (11Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G.

Thus, the effect of Rdr1p appears to be mediated by a subset of the target genes of Pdr1p/Pdr3p. We have shown that the zinc cluster proteins Leu3p and Uga3p both recognize CGG triplets oriented in opposite directions (an everted repeat) and spaced by 4 bp (CCGN4CGG) (44Noël J. Turcotte B. J.

Discrimination of these highly related DNA sequences is achieved by nucleotides located between the CGG triplets (44Noël J. Turcotte B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17463-17468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, nucleotides outside the PDRE core sequence (CCGCGG) may allow targeting of Rdr1p to a subset of the Pdr1p/Pdr3p-responsive genes. What is the mechanism of action of Rdr1p? It is possible that Rdr1p binds directly to PDREs found in promoters of target genes resulting in decreased activity. For example, Rdr1p could compete with Pdr1p and Pdr3p for binding to PDREs. A related model would involve the formation of heterodimers between Rdr1p and Pdr1p or Pdr3p. Such heterodimers would be impaired for activation of the PDR5 gene. In support of this model, zinc cluster proteins Oaf1 and Pip2p, involved in activation of peroxisomal genes, have been shown to bind to DNA as heterodimers (45Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Tabak H.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Ada3p, a subunit of the SAGA complex involved in chromatin remodeling, represses activity of Pdr1p (46Martens J.A. Genereaux J. Saleh A. Brandl C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15884-15890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, the action of Rdr1p may be mediated by Ada3p. Another possibility is that the effect of Rdr1p is indirect. Rdr1p may control the level of a transcription factor involved in activation of PDR5 gene expression. A number of hyperactive alleles of PDR1 and PDR3 have been isolated (19Carvajal E. van den Hazel H.B. Cybularz-Kolaczkowska A. Balzi E. Goffeau A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 406-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 20Nourani A. Papajova D. Delahodde A. Jacq C. Subik J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). One may speculate that these mutations relieve the inhibitory effect of Rdr1p. However, activation of a PDR5 reporter by some Pdr1p mutants is increased more than 80-fold as compared with wild-type Pdr1p (19Carvajal E. van den Hazel H.B. Cybularz-Kolaczkowska A. Balzi E. Goffeau A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 406-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) whereas the maximal effect achieved by removing Rdr1p is only 10-fold. Thus, inactivation of Rdr1p is unlikely to account in full for the hyperactivity of the Pdr1p/Pdr3p mutants. Even though our microarray analysis points to a very limited number of affected genes, removal of Rdr1p results in an interesting phenotype, an increased resistance to cycloheximide. Previous studies (3Bauer B.E. Wolfger H. Kuchler K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 4Koloczkowska A. Goffeau A. Drug Res. Updates. 1999; 2: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) have identified Pdr1p and Pdr3p as positive regulators of PDR5, and our laboratory has recently discovered an additional transcriptional activator of PDR5. 2B. Akache and B. Turcotte, unpublished results. This study shows that PDR5 is also negatively regulated by Rdr1p. Thus, the regulation of the PDR5 gene expression appears to be more complex than initially anticipated. Further studies will be required to better understand the mechanism of action of RDR1, but the results presented here raise the possibility that similar transcriptional repressors would be present in pathogenic yeasts such as Candida albicans.

The activated IL-1 receptor complex, which consists of the IL-1 receptor type I and the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), generates multiple cellular responses including NF-κB activation, IL-2 secretion, and IL-2 promoter activation. Reconstitution experiments in EL4D6/76 cells lacking IL-1RAcP expression and IL-1 responsiveness were used to analyze structure-function relationships of the IL-1RAcP cytoplasmic tail. Mutating a potential tyrosine kinase phosphorylation motif and various conserved amino acid (aa) residues had no effect on IL-1 responsiveness. Truncation analyses revealed that box 3 of the TIR domain was required for NF-κB activation, IL-2 production, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, whereas IL-2 promoter activation was only partially inhibited. Surprisingly, deletion of aa 527–534 resulted in almost complete loss of all IL-1 responsiveness. Replacement of these aa with alanyl residues did not reconstitute NF-κB activation, IL-2 production, or JNK activation but partly restored IL-2 promoter activation. Immunoprecipitation data revealed a strong correlation between MyD88 binding with NF-κB activation and IL-2 production but not with IL-2 promoter activation. Taken together, our data indicate that box 3 of IL-1RAcP is critical for IL-1-dependent NF-κB activation and stabilization of IL-2 mRNA via JNK, whereas aa 527–534 largely contribute to IL-2 promoter activation.

IL-1 binds to two different receptors of the Ig superfamily: IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI) and IL-1 receptor type II (IL-1RII). Both receptors bind the ligands with distinct affinities (1.Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas IL-1RI is necessary for signal transduction (2.Heguy A.

Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 311-315PubMed Google Scholar), IL-1RII is not capable of transducing an activation signal but rather acts as a decoy receptor serving as a ligand sink and competing for IL-1 with the IL-1RI (3.Colotta F.

An additional member of the IL-1 receptor family, IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), has also been identified. The 66-kDa IL-1RAcP shares limited homology with IL-1RI and IL-1RII but does not bind IL-1 (6.Greenfeder S.A. Varnell T. Powers G. Lombard-Gillooly K. Shuster D. McIntyre K.W. Ryan D.E. Levin W.

We have previously described an IL-1RI-positive subclone of EL4 cells, EL4D6/76, which binds IL-1 with high affinity but fails to activate NF-κB or produce IL-2 following IL-1 stimulation (7.Hofmeister R.

This defect is due to the lack of IL-1RAcP expression and can be overcome by transfection with IL-1RAcP, thus reconstituting IL-1-specific functional defects in EL4D6/76 cells (7.Hofmeister R.

In the present study we investigated regions within the cytoplasmic domain of IL-1RAcP that are required for perpetuating IL-1 responses. We present data demonstrating that, in addition to box 3 (aa 538–542) of the TIR domain, aa 527–534 within the cytoplasmic domain of IL-1RAcP are essential for IL-1 signaling. Truncated forms of IL-1RAcP were constructed by PCR technique. The vector pEF-IL-1RAcP containing the murine IL-1RAcP coding sequence was used as a template (9.Korherr C. Hofmeister R. Wesche H. Falk W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Truncated fragments were cloned into pFLAG-IL-1RAcP (kind gift of Michael Martin, Hannover, Germany), a derivative of pFLAG-CMV-1 (Sigma). Deletions in the IL-1RAcP sequence were performed with the ExSite™PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), whereas point mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After successful mutagenesis, the cDNA was cloned into the pFLAG-IL-1RAcP using BglII and XbaI, respectively. All truncations and mutations were verified by sequence analysis. An IL-1-inducible fragment of the murine IL-2 promoter (−1 to −303) was cloned viaKpnI and BglII into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany) (pGL3-IL-2(−303)) (33.Stricker K. Serfling E. Krammer P.H. Falk W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 1475-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For determination of transcriptional activity of NF-κB, five tandemly arranged NF-κB binding sites from the HIV long terminal repeat enhancer (5′-GGGACTTTCC-3′) (34.Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar) were cloned viaBglII and HindIII into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic (pGL3–5xNFκB). Mouse thymoma EL4 D6/76 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) containing 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 30 μm 2-mercapthoethanol (culture medium) at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. For stimulation, 2 × 105 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Recombinant human IL-1α (rhIL-1α) and recombinant mouse IL-18 (rmIL-18) were purchased from R&D Systems GmbH (Wiesbaden, Germany), whereas PMA was purchased from Sigma. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured and stimulated in Dulbecco's modified essential medium high glucose (PAA Laboratories, Linz, Austria) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin under the conditions indicated above. EL4D6/76 cells at a density of ≤5 × 105/ml were transiently transfected by the DEAE-dextran method. Briefly, the transfection reagent was freshly prepared by mixing 300 μl of 0.5 mg/ml DEAE-dextran in Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 123 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm Na2HPO4) and 300 μl of chloroquine (80 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline) containing 500 ng of IL-1RAcP expression plasmid encoding the various mutated forms of the co-receptor chain together with 1 μg of the reporter plasmid. 5 × 106 cells (in logarithmic growth phase) were washed in PBS, pH 7.4, and resuspended in Tris-buffered saline. After centrifugation the supernatant was decanted, and the cells were resuspended in the residual liquid. Subsequently, the DEAE-dextran-DNA transfection mix was added, and the cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Afterward, the cells were washed twice with phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium (PAN Systems) plus supplements and cultured for 24 h in 6-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) at a density of 106 cells/ml. 293IL-1RI cells stably expressing human IL-1RI (12.Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar) were co-transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method with different amounts of pRK7-Myc/MyD88 encoding human MyD88 fused to an N-terminal Myc tag and 1–3 μg of pFLAG-IL-1RAcP encoding mouse wild type (wt) or mutant co-receptor chain, respectively. The total amount of DNA in all transfections was kept constant by adding empty vector cDNA. For measurement of the IL-2 promoter activation or NF-κB activation, EL4D6/76 cells were co-transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmids pGL3-IL-2(−303) or pGL3–5xNFκB, respectively. After cultivation for 18 h, 2 × 105 transfected cells were seeded per well of a ViewPlate-96 (Packard, Groningen, The Netherlands) at a density of 106/ml in RPMI 1640 without phenol red and stimulated in the absence or presence of 20 units/ml rhIL-1α, 250 ng/ml rmIL-18, 10 ng/ml PMA or co-stimulated with PMA and cytokine for 18 h. Luciferase activity was detected by the Steady-Glo luciferase assay kit (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. As an internal control, EL4 D6/76 cells were co-transfected with 300 ng of pRL-SV40 vector (Promega) encoding Renilla luciferase under control of SV40 early enhancer/promoter leading to constitutive expression ofRenilla luciferase. Expression of both firefly andRenilla luciferase was detected using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) as described by the manufacturer. The luciferase activity was measured in at least triplicate cultures for 0.1 min using the TopCount microplate scintillation counter (Packard). IL-2 secretion into the culture supernatants was quantified by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Microtiter plates were coated with rat anti-mouse IL-2 (PharMingen, Hamburg, Germany; 1 μg/ml in 0.1 mNaHCO3, pH 8.5). Additional binding sites were blocked with PBS with 10% fetal calf serum, and the plates were washed with PBS with 0.05% Tween 20. After addition of 50 μl of culture supernatants or serial diluted recombinant proteins as standards, the plates were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C, washed extensively, and incubated with biotinylated rat anti-mouse IL-2 (PharMingen; 1 μg/ml in PBS with fetal calf serum) for a further 60 min at 37 °C. After extensive washing, the plates were incubated with 160 milliunits/ml streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of 100 μl of a 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid solution (Devitron, Castrop-Rauxel, Germany). The signals were detected by measuring the extinction at 405 nm against a reference wavelength at 490 nm using the Titertek Multiskan MCC microplate reader (Flow, Meckenheim, Germany). Quantification of IL-2 in the samples derived from a standard curve obtained with the recombinant cytokine. 24–36 h after transfection, 293IL-1RI cells were stimulated in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml rhIL-1β (Genentech, San Francisco, CA) for 5 min and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cleared lysates were adjusted to 0.75% Nonidet P-40 and 375 mmNaCl, divided into two aliquots, and incubated with either preimmune serum and protein A (Amersham Biosciences) or anti-FLAG M2-Sepharose (Sigma) for 2–10 h. The precipitates were thoroughly washed with lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 500 mm NaCl and boiled in Laemmli buffer (35.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). The solubilized proteins were separated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blotting using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). 5 × 106EL4D6/76 cells were transfected as indicated with 1 μg of IL-1RAcP expression plasmid encoding the various mutated forms of the co-receptor chain together with 500 ng of pGL3-Control vector (Promega) constitutively expressing the luciferase reporter gene. After a recovery phase of 24 h at 37 °C, the cells were starved for 24 h in RPMI 1640/PBS (1:1) supplemented with 10 mmHEPES, antibiotics, and 2-mercaptoethanol and divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was used for the determination of luciferase activity as a measure of transcription efficiency using the luciferin/luciferase reaction. The cells of the second aliquot were stimulated with or without IL-1α (3 × 103 units/ml) for 30 min. For the preparation of nuclear extracts, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 6.25 mm NaF, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 12.5 mm p-nitro-phenyl phosphate, and 1.25 mmNaVO3 and incubated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm NaF, 10 μmNa2MoO4, 0.1 mm EDTA for 15 min on ice. After the addition of Nonidet P-40 (final concentration, 0.5%) and vortexing the samples for 10 s, the homogenates were shortly centrifuged, extracted on ice for 30 min in 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 μmNa2MoO4, 1 mm NaVO3, 10 mm p-nitro-phenyl phosphate, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 ×g. JNK activity in the supernatants was detected as phospho-c-Jun using the Trans-AM™ AP-1 c-Jun transcription factor assay kit (Active Motif Europe, Rixensart, Belgium) as described by the manufacturer. Statistical differences between the mean values were analyzed using the two-sided Student's ttest. In addition to IL-1RI, co-expression of the IL-1RAcP is essential for a fully functional receptor complex (7.Hofmeister R. Wiegmann K. Korherr C. Bernardo K. Krönke M. Falk W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27730-27736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8.Huang J. Gao X. Li S. Cao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7727-7731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Therefore we investigated the contribution of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-1RAcP to IL-1-induced signal transduction. To test the functionality of truncated or mutated IL-1RAcP constructs, EL4D6/76 cells lacking IL-1RAcP expression (9.Korherr C. Hofmeister R. Wesche H. Falk W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) were transiently transfected with these constructs, and IL-1-mediated signal transduction was investigated in the transfectants using the co-transfected luciferase reporter pGL3-IL-2(−303). Arbitrary stepwise truncations showed that the C terminus of murine IL-1RAcP protein could be truncated by 19 aa, up to aa 551, without affecting its capacity to activate the IL-2 promoter. However, truncation for an additional 40 aa, up to residue 511, as well as truncation of the complete cytoplasmic domain, up to aa 384, resulted in a complete loss of function (data not shown). More detailed truncation studies (Fig. 1, Aand B) demonstrated that IL-1RAcP constructs truncated up to aa 544 showed a significantly enhanced activation of the IL-2 promoter compared with the wt response. Mutants lacking an additional 7 aa (IL-1RAcPΔ537) or 14 aa (IL-1RAcPΔ530) were still able to activate the IL-2 promoter upon IL-1 stimulation, although the activation was reduced to ∼35% of the wt response (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, truncation of additional 7 aa, up to residue 523, resulted in a complete loss of IL-1-induced IL-2 promoter activation compared with wt. However, the IL-18 response, performed as an internal control, remained unaffected for each case analyzed, indicating that all cells were completely functional. Additional important IL-1-mediated signaling events include promotion of IL-2 secretion and activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (1.Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar, 37.Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5563) Google Scholar, 38.Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4271) Google Scholar). Therefore we investigated the effect of the mutated/truncated IL-1RAcP on these IL-1-induced effects. EL4D6/76 cells were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3–5xNFκB, containing five NF-κB binding sites and the indicated mutated IL-1RAcP constructs. As shown in Fig. 1 (C andD), truncation of 27 aa, up to residue 544 (IL-1RAcPΔ544), did not affect IL-1-induced NF-κB activation significantly, whereas IL-1-dependent IL-2 production was slightly increased. Truncation of an additional 7 aa (IL-1RAcPΔ537) or 14 aa (IL-1RAcPΔ530) resulted in a decrease of IL-1-induced NF-κB activation to ∼8% of the activity observed with the wt and a 90% reduction in IL-2 secretion. Truncation of 47 aa, up to residue 523 (IL-1RAcPΔ523), led to a complete loss of IL-1RAcP function. In contrast, mutant transfected cells showed no altered effects to IL-18 stimulation, demonstrating that all cells were fully functional. From these observations we conclude that aa 524–537 within the cytoplasmic domain of IL-1RAcP preferentially contribute to IL-1-induced IL-2 promoter activation, whereas NF-κB stimulation and IL-2 secretion appear to be predominantly affected by aa 537–544. To further characterize the essential aa region in more detail, extensive deletion/mutation analyses were performed. For this purpose, we constructed deletion mutants of IL-1RAcP, starting with deletion of aa 524–537 and systematically removing single aa residues stepwise from the N and C termini and moving toward the central residues, and tested their signaling capacity. Deletion of aa 524–537 resulted in the inability of the protein to activate both IL-1-specific effects, namely IL-2 production and IL-2 promoter activation. Similar results were obtained with mutant IL-1RAcP molecules lacking aa 524–551 (data not shown). In this context, aa 527–534 were found to be the shortest region essential for IL-1 responsiveness, because deletion of these aa resulted in an almost complete loss of IL-1-induced IL-2 promoter activation and IL-2 production compared with wt IL-1RAcP (9.1 and 2.3% residual activity, respectively). Smaller deletions (i.e.Δ528–533, Δ528–534, and Δ527–533) had no effect on the IL-1 response (Fig. 2). Replacement of aa 527–534 by 8 alanyl residues (8 × Ala) did not reconstitute IL-1-induced IL-2 production but did partly restore IL-2 promoter activation capacity (24% of the wt response; Fig. 2), suggesting that for IL-2 promoter activation a synergistic contribution of aa 527–534 and box 3 is necessary for optimal effects. Single aa changes of the conserved Pro534 → Ala as well as mutation of conserved Trp526 → Phe and the neighboring Lys527 → Gly did not affect IL-1 responsiveness (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the critical region was found to harbor a potential tyrosine kinase phosphorylation motif. However, mutation of the three consensus aa Lys525, Glu529, and Tyr535 to Arg, Asp, and Phe had no effect on either IL-1-induced IL-2 promoter activation and IL-2 production (Fig. 2). To further validate our data, EL4 D6/76 cells were co-transfected, in addition to the pGL3-IL-2(−303) reporter and selected IL-1RAcP mutants, with a Renilla luciferase reporter construct leading to constitutive expression of Renilla luciferase. After stimulation, the data on IL-2 promoter-driven firefly luciferase activity confirmed our results observed in the single luciferase reporter assay, whereas Renilla luciferase activity was identical in all lysates, indicating that experimental conditions were comparable in each case analyzed (data not shown). Furthermore, we examined the effect of IL-1 on activation of the stress-activated protein kinase pathway as another major downstream signaling event. For this purpose, EL4D6/76 cells were transiently transfected with various mutants of IL-1RAcP and analyzed for IL-1-dependent activation of JNK. As demonstrated in Fig. 3., mutants of IL-1RAcP lacking box 3 (i.e. IL-1RAcPΔ523 and IL-1RAcPΔ537) did not show any IL-1-dependent activation of JNK. In contrast, in the presence of box 3 (IL-1RAcPΔ544) JNK activation occurred, although it was reduced to ∼65% of the wt response. Deletion of aa 527–534 resulted in the complete loss of IL-1-induced JNK activation. Substitution of this aa stretch by 8 alanyl residues (8 × Ala) was unable to reconstitute IL-1 responsiveness. Because we found aa 527–534 to be essential for IL-1 responsiveness,"
https://openalex.org/W1979957855,"RGS proteins (regulators ofG protein signaling) are a diverse family of proteins that act to negatively regulate signaling by heterotrimeric G proteins. Initially characterized as GTPase-activating proteins for Gα subunits, recent data have implied additional functions for RGS proteins. We previously identified an RGS protein (termed RGSZ1) whose expression is quite specific to neuronal tissue (Glick, J. L., Meigs, T. E., Miron, A., and Casey, P. J. (1998)<i>J. Biol. Chem</i>. 273, 26008–26013). In a continuing effort to understand the role of RGSZ1 in cellular signaling, the yeast two-hybrid system was employed to identify potential effector proteins of RGSZ1. The microtubule-destabilizing protein SCG10 (superior cervical ganglia, neural specific 10) was found to directly interact with RGSZ1 in the yeast system, and this interaction was further verified using direct binding assays. Treatment of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor resulted in Golgi-specific distribution of SCG10. A green fluorescent protein-tagged variant of RGSZ1 translocated to the Golgi complex upon treatment of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor, providing evidence that RGSZ1 and SCG10 interact in cells as well as <i>in vitro</i>. Analysis of <i>in vitro</i> microtubule polymerization/depolymerization showed that binding of RGSZ1 to SCG10 effectively blocked the ability of SCG10 to induce microtubule disassembly as determined by both turbidimetric and microscopy-based assays. These results identify a novel connection between RGS proteins and the cytoskeletal network that points to a broader role than previously envisioned for RGS proteins in regulating biological processes."

This organism has a digenetic life cycle that consists of two major developmental forms: 1) extracellular flagellated promastigotes that reside and multiply in the alimentary tract of their sandfly vectors and 2) obligate intracellular nonflagellated amastigotes that reside and multiply within the phago-lysosomal system of infected human macrophages.

Understanding and investigating the role(s) that this AcP plays in parasite growth and survival would be facilitated by the characterization of the gene(s) that encodes this unique enzyme. To date, however, no such leishmanial genes have been reported. Thus, in the current study we identified the gene encoding this novel L. donovani enzyme and characterized its structure, expression, and localization in both developmental forms of the parasite. Further, a variety of green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeric constructs was used as reporters in a homologous leishmanial expression system to dissect the functional domains of this unique, tartrate-resistant, surface membrane enzyme. All chemicals used, unless otherwise noted, were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma. Similarly, enzymes and DNA molecular mass standards were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Protein molecular mass standards were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. L. donovani promastigotes ([1S, clone 2D]from the 1S strain World Health Organization designation: (MHOM/SD/62/1S-CL2D) were grown at 26 °C in chemically defined 199(+) medium as described by McCarthy-Burke et al. (7McCarthy-Burke C. Bates P.A. Dwyer D.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1991; 73: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Axenic amastigotes forms of this L. donovani clone were grown at 37 °C as described by Joshi et al. (8Joshi M. Dwyer D.M. Nakhasi H.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). All of the cultures were harvested at log phase (2–3 × 107 cells ml−1) by centrifugation as described (9Shakarian A.M. Dwyer D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 208: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The cell pellets were resuspended in the appropriate buffers for isolation of nucleic acids, for preparation of surface membrane fractions, or for transfection experiments. Tissue-derived amastigotes of this L. donovani strain were isolated from spleens of infected hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus; LVG strain, Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, MA) as described previously (10Dwyer D.M. Langreth S.G. Dwyer N.K. Z. Parasitenk. 1974; 43: 227-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cell lysates of both promastigotes and axenic amastigotes were prepared from washed cell pellets by the addition of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 25 μg ml−1 leupeptin, pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 5 × 108 cells ml−1 and disruption in a prechilled, tightly fitting Dounce homogenizer (5Gottlieb M. Dwyer D.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1981; 52: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The lysates were centrifuged at 8000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to obtain parasite surface membrane-enriched fractions (8K pellets). The supernatant was removed, and the 8K pellets were washed twice with buffer (10 mm HEPES, 145 mm NaCl, pH, 7.4) by centrifugation as above. The washed 8K pellets were solubilized (at ∼5 × 108 cell equivalents ml−1) in the same buffer containing 1.0% Triton X-100 (Surfact-Amps® X-100; Pierce), 1.0% octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) by stirring at 4 °C for ∼12 h (11Gbenle G.O. Dwyer D.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The samples were centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants, which contained the detergent-solubilized parasite surface membrane components, were assayed for enzyme activity or used in immunoprecipitations and Western blot analyses. The protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (microBCA; Pierce) method (12Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K.

Total genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from promastigotes using the GNome DNA isolation kit from Bio 101 (La Jolla, CA). Total RNA was isolated from promastigotes, axenic amastigotes, and tissue-derived amastigotes using the RNeasy method (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) as described previously (13Shakarian A.M. Ellis S.L. Mallinson D.J. Olafson R.W. Dwyer D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 196: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A probe common to the 5′-ends of the L. donovani AcP gene family (13Shakarian A.M. Ellis S.L. Mallinson D.J. Olafson R.W. Dwyer D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 196: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was generated by PCR amplification with Taq polymerase and digoxygenin-dUTP according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The conditions for amplification were 95 °C for 1 min, 42 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min (40 cycles), and 72 °C for 6 min. This 300-bp probe was generated with oligo primers forward 1, 5′-CAGAACGACCGACATGC, and reverse 2, 5′-GACATACTTGAACCAGG using the previously described pAcP396(13Shakarian A.M. Ellis S.L. Mallinson D.J. Olafson R.W. Dwyer D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 196: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) as a template. The resulting digoxygenin-labeled fragment (DIG-300) was used in hybridization studies. In addition, an oligo unique to MAcP, forward 111, 5′-CGCGAAATGCATGAAGGGCGCAATCGCGTCTTCGATATGG, was labeled with digoxygenin-dUTP by tailing with terminal transferase according to the Genius Labeling kit 6 manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The resulting MAcP specific oligo probe (DIG-111) was used in hybridization studies. gDNA was digested in independent reactions with several restriction endonucleases, and the restriction fragments were separated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. These gels were prepared for blotting as described previously (13Shakarian A.M. Ellis S.L. Mallinson D.J. Olafson R.W. Dwyer D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 196: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). DNA was transferred under vacuum and UV cross-linked to nylon membranes (Hybond-N; Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were processed for hybridization with the DIG-300 or DIG-111 probes according to the Genius system user's guide (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the hybridized fragments were visualized using the Genius detection system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and fluorography. A cosmid library of L. donovani gDNA (kindly provided by Dr. B. Ullman, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR) was screened by hybridization using the DIG-300 probe. DNA isolated from positive cosmid clones (Magic Miniprep; Promega, Madison, WI) was analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion and Southern hybridization analyses. Cosmids containing an ∼3.0-kb PstI AcP insert (Cos AcP-101, -102, and -103) were subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis. DNA was sequenced using the fluorescent dideoxy chain terminator cycle sequencing method (14McCombie W.R. Heiner C. Kelly J.M. Fitzgerald M.G. Gocayne J.D. DNA Seq. 1992; 2: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) at the Johns Hopkins University DNA Analysis Facility (Baltimore, MD) as described previously (9Shakarian A.M. Dwyer D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 208: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Sequence data from both strands were analyzed using the Genetic Computer Group software package (15Devereaux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar) running on a National Institutes of Health Unix system and SequencerTM 3.0 software (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). Signal sequence and protease cleavage sites were predicted using Analyze-Signalase 2.0.3 (16Mantei, N. (1992) electronic file available on internet via anonymous ftp from ftp://bio.indiana.edu.molbiolGoogle Scholar). Reverse transcription was carried out with total RNA from L. donovani promastigotes, axenic amastigotes, and tissue-derived amastigotes using Superscript II (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA) and oligo(dT) to generate cDNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplification reactions contained the following oligo primer pair: primer pair 1, forward B, 5′-GCACCAGCTGCGTCCTCT, and reverse B, 5′-ATCACGCCAACTGCAGA. PCR amplification reactions contained primer pair 1, 2 μl of the cDNA generated above, dNTPs (Promega) Taq polymerase, and the appropriate buffer in a final volume of 50 μl. The conditions for amplification were 95 °C for 1 min, 42 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min (40 cycles), and 72 °C for 6 min. PCR products were analyzed by 3.0% NuSieve® agarose (FMC® Bioproducts, Rockland, ME) gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Gel-purified PCR products (SephaglasTM Bandprep kit; Amersham Biosciences) were subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis. Two individual peptides unique to the MAcP-deduced protein were synthesized using 9-fluoromethyloxycarbonyl chemistry: peptide 1, Lys-Phe-Pro-Phe-Phe-Arg-Phe-Pro-Tyr-Arg-Arg-Arg-Asp-Cys-Ala-Leu-His (kindly provided by the Laboratory of Molecular Structure NIAID, National Institutes of Health), and peptide 2, Arg-Phe-Pro-Tyr-Arg-Arg-Arg-Asp-Cys-Ala-Leu (Genosys Biotechnologies Inc., The Woodlands, TX). These peptides were conjugated to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Imject-activated immunogen conjugation kit; Pierce). Anti-peptide antibodies (anti-MAcP peptide Ab) were produced in a New Zealand White rabbit (No. 1407) by Spring Valley Laboratories, Inc. (Woodbine, MD) by subscapular immunization with a mixture containing 1.25 mg of each of the conjugated peptides (2.5 mg total) as described previously (9Shakarian A.M. Dwyer D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 208: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The resulting anti-MAcP peptide Ab was used in both Western blot analyses and immunoprecipitation activity assays. In addition, a rabbit monospecific (No. 172) Ab to the L. donovani SAcP (17Bates P.A. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 26: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and the appropriate control sera were used as positive controls in these assays. An anti-GFP mouse monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA) was also used in Western blots and in indirect immunofluorescence assays to detect GFP chimeric proteins. A rabbit anti-Bip antibody was a kind gift from Dr. James Bangs (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Further, a goat anti-rabbit rhodamine-conjugated antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and a goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (Sigma) were used as secondary antibodies for fluorescence microscopy. Solubilized promastigote and axenic amastigote surface membrane extracts (10 μg of total protein/lane), cell lysates of promastigotes and tissue-derived amastigotes (15 μg of total protein/lane), or culture supernatants (15 μl/lane) from transfectants were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% precast Tris-Glycine Novex® gels, Invitrogen), and the proteins were transblotted (9Shakarian A.M. Dwyer D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 208: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) onto nylon (polyvinylidene difluoride) membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were probed with the anti-MAcP peptide Ab, preimmune serum from this rabbit (i.e. normal rabbit serum (NRS)), the L. donovaniSAcP control antiserum, or anti-GFP Ab using the LumiGLOTMWestern blot kit reagents (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Immunodetection was carried out using the chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase system in the LumiGLOTM kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). Solubilized surface membrane extracts from L. donovani promastigotes and axenic amastigotes were reacted with anti-MAcP peptide Ab or NRS in a protein A-Sepharose 4B/CL (AmershamBiosciences) bead-based assay as described previously (9Shakarian A.M. Dwyer D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 208: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were subsequently assayed for AcP activity in the presence or absence of 5 mm sodium tartrate (L(+)-tartaric acid; ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA), as described previously (18Ellis S.L. Shakarian A.M. Dwyer D.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1998; 89: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All of the samples were assayed in triplicate, and these assays were repeated on multiple samples. One unit of enzyme activity (19Gottlieb M. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) reflects the hydrolysis of 1 nmol of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (U.S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH) to p-nitrophenol min−1 mg−1 of detergent-solubilized parasite surface membrane protein at 42 °C. The percentage of activity immunoprecipitated was determined using the following formula: (activity bound/[activity bound + activity unbound]) × 100. The results obtained from immunoprecipitations were normalized by subtracting the values obtained with NRS from those obtained with the anti-MAcP peptide Ab. The designations used in this report for proteins, genes, and plasmids follows the nomenclature for Trypanosoma and Leishmania as suggested by Clayton et al. (20Clayton C. Adams M. Almeida R.

Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) to express GFP-MAcP chimeras for studies of the functional domains of the MAcP. In a multi-step process, the potential signal peptide (SP) of MAcP, GFP, and the putative transmembrane anchor domain (TM) of MAcP were PCR-amplified and subcloned to generate pKS NEO MAcPSP::GFP::TM. First, PCR amplification of the TM domain of MAcP was performed using Cos AcP-101 as template with the primer pair, forward MAcPTM 5′-TGGTGGAGCGCT CCCGCCTTATATAAATTGATAGCTACGTGT (Eco47 restriction endonuclease site in bold type) and reverse MAcPTM 5′-TGGTGGACGCGT TGGACTAGT CCCTTAATACACGCGAAATGCATG (MluI and SpeI restriction endonuclease sites in bold type). The resulting PCR product was cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (TA Cloning System; Invitrogen) to generate the plasmid pCR2.1 MAcPTM. Second, the GFP gene was amplified from plasmid pEGFP-1 (CLONTECH) using primers forward GFP 5′-TGGTGGAGCGCT CCCACGCGT CCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCG (Eco47 and MluI restriction endonuclease sites in bold type) and reverse GFP 5′-CCAAGCGCT CTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATG (Eco47 restriction endonuclease site in bold type). The resulting PCR product was cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), resulting in the plasmid construct pCR2.1 EGFP. Third, the MAcP signal peptide plus its peptidase cleavage site (Arg24) was PCR-amplified from Cos AcP-101 template with primers forward MAcPSP 5′-CATGACGTCACTAGT ATGGCCTCGAAGCTCATC (SpeI restriction endonuclease site in bold type) and reverse MAcPSP 5′-TGGTGGACGCGT CCATGCGCACGACAAGGC (MluI restriction endonuclease site in bold type). The resulting PCR product was cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) to produce pCR2.1 MAcPSP. The first chimera that contained GFP and the putative TM domain of MAcP was constructed by subcloning the gel-purified Eco47-digested GFP fragment from pCR2.1 EGFP into the Eco47-linearized pCR2.1 MAcPTM construct, which resulted in the plasmid construct pCR2.1 GFP::TM. The orientation of the GFP fragment was verified using gel electrophoresis analysis with the appropriate restriction endonucleases. The second chimera containing the MAcP SP, GFP, and the putative MAcP TM domain was produced by subcloning the gel-purified MluI fragment of pCR2.1 GFP::TM into the MluI-linearized pCR2.1 MAcPSP, which resulted in the plasmid construct pCR2.1 MAcPSP::GFP::TM. The orientation of the GFP::TM fragment was verified using gel electrophoresis analysis with the appropriate restriction endonucleases. pCR2.1 MAcPSP::GFP::TM was digested with SpeI, and the gel-purified fragment was subcloned into the SpeI-linearized leishmanial expression vector pKS NEO, resulting in the plasmid construct pKS NEO MAcPSP::GFP::TM. Orientation of the subcloned fragment was verified using gel electrophoresis analysis with the appropriate restriction endonucleases. The final construct pKS NEO MAcPSP::GFP::TM was verified by sequence analysis as described above and was subsequently transfected into L. donovani promastigotes for functional domain analysis studies. Other MAcP-GFP chimeric expression plasmids including pKS NEO MAcPSP::GFP and pKS NEO GFP were constructed using the same multi-step PCR-based cloning strategy above as appropriate. For transfection experiments, harvested promastigote cells were resuspended in electroporation buffer to 108 cells ml−1 as described previously (22Debrabant A. Ghedin E. Dwyer D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16366-16372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 500 μl of cell suspension was added to a 2-mm gap electroporation cuvette (BTX Inc., San Diego, CA). Immediately prior to electroporation, 20 μl of purified plasmid DNA (1 mg ml−1 in sterile 10 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA (Quality Biological, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), pH 8.0) was added to the cell suspension. The cells were electroporated using a BTX Inc. ECM-600 electroporation system. Electroporation conditions were a single pulse at 475 V, 800 microfarads, and 13 ohms. The electroporated cells were incubated on ice for 10 min and transferred into 5 ml of culture medium as described above and incubated at 26 °C for 24 h. The transfected cells were subsequently harvested by centrifugation as above and resuspended in culture medium containing 15 μg ml−1 G418 (Geneticin, Invitrogen). Transfected cells were selected for growth in increasing concentrations of G418 over a period of several weeks and maintained at 200 μg ml−1 drug. The drug-resistant cells were used in subsequent experiments. Transfected promastigotes were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation as described above. Fluorescence images of such live cells were acquired using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY), which was equipped with epifluorescence, a cooled CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ), and the appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate excitation/barrier filters. Transfected parasites were also examined in indirect immunofluorescence assays using anti-Bip and anti-GFP antibodies essentially as described by Debrabant et al.(22Debrabant A. Ghedin E. Dwyer D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16366-16372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Such cells were examined by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 410 system with fluorescein isothiocyanate and rhodamine excitation/barrier filters. The fluorescent images obtained in these channels were collected separately. All of the captured images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.5 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Previously we identified and characterized the genes that encode the 110- and 130-kDa isoforms of the L. donovani histidine secretory AcPs (SAcP-1 and SAcP-2) (13Shakarian A.M. Ellis S.L. Mallinson D.J. Olafson R.W. Dwyer D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 196: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the current study, results of Southern analysis of L. donovani gDNA digested with PstI revealed three restriction fragments (5.2, 3.9, and 3.0 kb) that hybridized with an L. donovani AcP gene probe (DIG-300) (Fig. 1). The two larger PstI fragments, of 3.9 and 5.2 kb, contained the SAcP-1 and SAcP-2 genes described above (13Shakarian A.M. Ellis S.L. Mallinson D.J. Olafson R.W. Dwyer D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 196: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The third PstI fragment, of 3.0 kb, was subcloned, sequenced, and found to contain a partial ORF, very similar but not identical in sequence to either SAcP-1 or SAcP-2. To obtain a full-length ORF corresponding to the 3.0-kb PstI fragment, an L. donovani gDNA cosmid library was screened with the DIG-300 probe, which is common to all three PstI restriction fragments. Seventeen positive clones were identified and analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion with PstI followed by Southern hybridization with the DIG-300 probe. Three of the 17 cosmid clones (Cos AcP-101, -102, and -103) contained a 3.0-kb PstI restriction fragment. Sequence analysis revealed that these cosmids contained a full-length (948 bp) ORF corresponding to the 3.0-kb PstI genomic fragment. Sequence analysis showed that the 948-bp ORF encoded a deduced protein with a calculated molecular mass of 35,192 Da and a predicted isoelectric point of 8.23. Analysis of the deduced aa sequence showed that it contained five potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn44, Asn96, Asn135, Asn219, and Asn245) (Fig. 2 A) and one predicted myristoylation site (Gly37). In addition, the deduced protein possessed five putative phosphorylation sites by several different mechanisms (i.e. casein kinase II: Ser83,Ser154, and Ser248 and protein kinase C: Thr107 and Thr247). Moreover, the most abundant residues of this deduced protein were alanine and leucine, which constitute 23% of its aa content. The deduced protein can be divided into three structural domains. Region I consists of a 23-aa putative signal peptide (Met1–Ala23) based on the Von Heijne algorithm (23Von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The sequence of this putative signal peptide including its peptidase cleavage site is identical to those present at the N termini of the SAcP-1- and SAcP-2-deduced proteins (13Shakarian A.M. Ellis S.L. Mallinson D.J. Olafson R.W. Dwyer D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 196: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, cleavage at this site would result in Arg 24 as the N-terminal aa of the mature protein. In addition, the two SAcP-deduced proteins of L. donovani (SAcP-1 and SAcP-2) and the 948-bp ORF-deduced protein above are identical in aa sequence for 251 residues beyond the signal peptide (Region II) (Fig. 2 B). The presence of a conserved histidine AcP signature sequence (i.e. a catalytic site consensus sequence) within Region II (Val27–Arg39) (Fig. 2) indicates that the 948-bp ORF-deduced protein is a member of this highly conserved family of enzymes. However, the second histidine AcP signature sequence (Ala285–Thr296) present in SAcP-1 and SAcP-2 is absent in the 948-bp ORF-deduced protein. The third region consists of the C terminus of this deduced protein. Based on the Kyte-Doolittle algorithm (24Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17215) Google Scholar), Region III of 948-bp ORF-deduced protein contains a stretch of 29 hydrophobic aa residues (Leu274–Tyr302) that could function as a transmembrane anchor domain (Fig. 2). This is followed by a short 13-aa putative cytoplasmic tail (Arg303–Tyr315). Cumulatively, these observations suggested that the 948-bp ORF represented a membrane-anchored member of the histidine acid phosphatase family; thus, this gene was designated as the L. donovani MAcP. Comparison of both nucleotide and deduced aa sequences revealed that the AcPs from L. donovani belong to a highly conserved multi-gene family. To determine whether MAcP constituted a distinct single gene or a multi-gene locus, we designed a specific oligo probe, DIG-111 (Fig. 3 A), that would only recognize MAcP and not SAcP-1 or SAcP-2. This oligo probe was used in Southern hybridization analysis of L. donovani gDNA. The results of these analyses with both single (AatII, NcoI, and NotI) and double restriction endonuclease (AatII and NcoI; AatII and NotI; and NcoI and NotI) digestions demonstrated that within an ∼6-kb region of L. donovani gDNA, only single restriction fragments were observed to hybridize with the DIG-111 probe (Fig. 3 B). One would expect that multiple restriction fragments would have hybridized with this probe, if the MAcP locus had been present in more than one copy. Thus, the hybridization results indicated that the 6 kb surrounding and including the MAcP locus were present only once within the L. donovani genome. These results were confirmed by Southern hybridization of the three cosmids clones, Cos AcP-101, -102, and -103, each of which was shown to contain a single MAcP ORF (data not shown). Transcription of MAcP was assayed in a two-step process involving RT and PCR amplification (Fi"
https://openalex.org/W2071404224,"This study describes the functional characterization of a specific mosquito transaminase responsible for catalyzing the transamination of 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) to xanthurenic acid (XA). The enzyme was purified from Aedes aegypti larvae by ammonium sulfate fractionation, heat treatment, and various chromatographic techniques, plus non-denaturing electrophoresis. The purified transaminase has a relative molecular mass of 42,500 by SDS-PAGE. N-terminal and internal sequencing of the purified protein and its tryptic fragments resolved a partial N-terminal sequence of 19 amino acid residues and 3 partial internal peptide sequences with 7, 10, and 7 amino acid residues. Using degenerate primers based on the partial internal sequences for PCR amplification and cDNA library screening, a full-length cDNA clone with a 1,167-bp open reading frame was isolated. Its deduced amino acid sequence consists of 389 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 43,239 and shares 45-46% sequence identity with mammalian alanine glyoxylate transaminases. Northern analysis shows the active transcription of the enzyme in larvae and developing eggs. Substrate specificity analysis of this mosquito transaminase demonstrates that the enzyme is active with 3-HK, kynurenine, or alanine substrates. The enzyme has greater affinity and catalytic efficiency for 3-HK than for kynurenine and alanine. The biochemical characteristics of the enzyme in conjunction with the profiles of 3-HK transaminase activity and XA accumulation during mosquito development clearly point out its physiological function in the 3-HK to XA pathway. Our data suggest that the mosquito transaminase was evolved in a manner precisely reflecting the physiological requirement of detoxifying 3-HK produced in the tryptophan oxidation pathway in the mosquito."

FTO-2B cells do not synthesize glycogen even when incubated with high doses of glucose. Adenovirus-induced overexpression of HK I and/or LGS, two enzymes endogenously expressed by these cells, did not produce a significant increase in the levels of active GS and the total glycogen content. In contrast, GK overexpression led to the glucose-dependent activation of endogenous or overexpressed LGS and to the accumulation of glycogen. Similarly overexpressed MGS was efficiently activated by the glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) produced by either endogenous or overexpressed HK I and by overexpressed GK. These results indicate the existence of at least two pools of Glc-6-P in the cell, one of them is accessible to both isoforms of GS and is replenished by the action of GK, whereas LGS is excluded from the cellular compartment where the Glc-6-P produced by HK I is directed. These findings are interpreted in terms of the metabolic role that the two pairs of enzymes, HK I-MGS in the muscle and GK-LGS in the hepatocyte, perform in their respective tissues.

GS can be inactivated by phosphorylation at multiple sites, but even highly phosphorylated forms of the enzyme become active “in vitro ” in the presence of high concentrations of glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P), which acts as an allosteric activator (1Villar-Palası́ C. Guinovart J.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 544-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). “In vivo,” Glc-6-P binding to GS also converts the enzyme into a better substrate for phosphatases and induces its dephosphorylation and activation (1Villar-Palası́ C. Guinovart J.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 544-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The two main isoforms of mammalian GS are designated as muscle and liver. Most tissues express the former, whereas the latter appears to be tissue-specific (2Roach P.J. Cheng C. Huang D. Lin A., Mu, J. Skurat A.V. Wilson W. Zhai L. J. Basic Clin. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1998; 9: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although the two forms have 70% identical amino acid sequence, the N and C termini, which contain the phosphorylation sites that regulate the activity of the enzyme, show a lower degree of homology (3Bai G. Zhang Z.J. Werner R. Nuttall F.Q. Tan A.W. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7843-7848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover the two isoforms have dissimilar intracellular distribution both in the absence and in the presence of glucose (4Fernández-Novell J.M. Bellido D. Vilaró S. Guinovart J.J. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting that there are significant differences in the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of glycogen synthesis in muscle and in liver. Using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in cultured hepatocytes, we have previously shown that overexpression of glucokinase (GK, hexokinase IV or hexokinase D), the isoenzyme of the mammalian hexokinase group characteristic of hepatocytes and pancreatic β cells, enhances glycogen synthesis, whereas overexpression of hexokinase I (HK I) has no effect (6O'Doherty R.M.

This is attributed to a different capacity of Glc-6-P produced by GK or HK I to induce the activation of liver glycogen synthase (LGS) (7Seoane J. Gómez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty R.M. Gómez-Ara C.

Further studies in cultured hepatocytes have shown that LGS shares the control of glycogen synthesis with GK (8Gomis R.R. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, the control of glycogen deposition from glucose in muscle is shared between glucose transport and muscle glycogen synthase (MGS) (9Azpiazu I. Manchester J. Skurat A.V. Roach P.J. Lawrence J.C. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 278: 234-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The FTO-2B rat hepatoma cell line has a highly differentiated hepatic phenotype (10Zvibel I. Fiorino A.S. Brill S. Reid L.M. Differentiation. 1998; 63: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 11Killary A.M. Fournier R.E. Cell. 1984; 38: 523-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and expresses genes characteristic of the liver, such as albumin and insulin-like growth factor II receptor. However, FTO-2B cells do not express GK and instead express high levels of HK I (12Valera A. Bosch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this hepatoma cell line, anaerobic glycolysis is impaired, and there is no glycogen deposition even in the presence of high concentrations of glucose (12Valera A. Bosch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The retrovirus-mediated expression of GK in FTO-2B cells stimulates glucose uptake and utilization and restores the ability of these cells to synthesize glycogen. It has been suggested that the increase in the levels of Glc-6-P in the GK-expressing cells was responsible for the glycogen deposition (12Valera A. Bosch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this study, we have taken advantage of the characteristics of the FTO-2B hepatoma cell line to show that LGS, but not the muscle isoform, is dependent on GK as the source of Glc-6-P for activation. The latter isoform, MGS, is activated and able to synthesize glycogen in response to glucose independently of the type of hexokinase present. This observation underlines the differences between the liver and muscle glycogen metabolism. AdCMV-GK (7Seoane J. Gómez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty R.M. Gómez-Ara C. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol.

In the metabolic impact studies, FTO-2B cells infected with AdCMV-GFP were used as control cells. FTO-2B rat hepatoma cells were cultured in 60-mm plates. Cells were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5 mm glucose and 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were treated for 2 h with adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 5 except for AdCMV-HK I, which was used at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Media were replaced with DMEM containing 10 mm glucose, and cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Media were then replaced by DMEM, and another incubation of 12–14 h was carried out. Cells were then incubated in DMEM at several concentrations of glucose as detailed in the text and figure legends. At the end of each manipulation, cell monolayers were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and frozen in liquid N2 until analysis. For the measurement of glycogen content, cell monolayers were scraped into 30% KOH, and the extract was then boiled for 15 min and centrifuged at 5,000 ×g for 15 min. Glycogen was measured in the cleared supernatants as described previously (15Chan T.M. Exton J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The intracellular concentration of Glc-6-P was measured by a spectrophotometric assay (16Lang G. Michal G. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3. Academic Press, New York1974: 1238-1242Google Scholar). Frozen cell monolayers from 60-mm-diameter plates were scraped using 100 μl of homogenization buffer, which consisted of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mm KF, 15 mm EDTA, 15 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Thawing plus sonication caused cell bursting. Protein concentration was measured following Bradford (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216068) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad assay reagent. Glucose phosphorylating activity was measured spectrophotometrically in the supernatant fraction of FTO-2B cell extracts centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min using 1 or 100 mm glucose at 30 °C as described previously (18Kuwajima M. Newgard C.B. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8849-8853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GS activity was measured in homogenates in the absence or presence of 6.6 mm Glc-6-P as described previously (19Thomas J.A. Schlender K.K. Larner J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). The activity measured in the absence of Glc-6-P represents the active form of the enzyme (I or aform), whereas that measured in the presence of 6.6 mmGlc-6-P represents total GS activity. HK I, GK, LGS, and MGS protein levels were measured by Western blot. Electrotransfer of proteins from the gel to the nitrocellulose was performed at 200 V (constant) at room temperature for 2 h using a Bio-Rad miniature transfer apparatus as described previously (20Tobwin H.

However, these cells expressed undetectable levels of GK, both measured as protein by Western blot (Fig.1 B, lane i) and by enzymatic activity (Table I), and instead expressed high levels of HK I (Fig. 1 A, lane i, and Table I).

Protein overexpression in FTO-2B cells was achieved very efficiently using recombinant adenoviruses. When AdCMV-GFP was used as control at a multiplicity of infection of 5, over 95% of the adenovirus-treated cells expressed GFP as detected by fluorescence microscopy (not shown). Infection of FTO-2B cells with AdCMV-HK I produced a 5-fold increase in HK I activity and protein content (Fig. 1 A, lanes i and ii, and Table I). When the AdCMV-GK was used, GK reached levels similar to those found in cultured hepatocytes, measured both as protein by densitometric analysis (Fig. 1 B,lane ii) or activity (Table I). AdCMV-LGS-infected cells showed a 3-fold increase in total GS activity (Table I). This increase was consistent with protein content analyzed by Western blot (Fig.1 C, lanes i and ii) with an antibody specific for rat LGS. Similarly MGS was overexpressed by infection of FTO-2B cells with AdCMV-MGS and also resulted in a 3-fold increase in total GS activity (Table I). The presence of the muscle isoform was also detected by Western blot using antibodies specific for MGS (Fig.1 D, lane ii). The multiplicity of infection used was 5 in all cases except with the AdCMV-HK I adenovirus, which was used at a multiplicity of infection of 10 to obtain intracellular levels of Glc-6-P similar to those obtained with the AdCMV-GK infection (see below). In addition, FTO-2B cells were simultaneously co-infected with AdCMV-LGS plus AdCMV-HK I or AdCMV-GK and with AdCMV-MGS plus AdCMV-HK I or AdCMV-GK. In the double infection experiments, HK I, GK, and total GS activities were comparable to those obtained when the viruses were used alone (Table I). Likewise the levels of protein measured by Western blot were also similar to those attained in the single infections (Fig. 1, lanes iii and iv). Despite containing 3-fold more total LGS than cultured hepatocytes (Table I), FTO-2B cells synthesized negligible amounts of glycogen in response to increasing doses of glucose (Fig.2 A). Intracellular Glc-6-P levels increased sharply when the cells were incubated with 5 mm glucose but remained constant at ∼2 nmol/mg of protein when higher concentrations of the sugar were used (Fig. 3 A). Nevertheless this accumulation of Glc-6-P induced neither the activation of LGS (Fig. 4) nor the deposition of glycogen.Figure 3Effects of HK I, GK , LGS , and MGS overexpression on Glc-6-P levels in FTO-2B cells.

Nevertheless HK I overexpression did not produce a significant increase in glycogen deposition (Fig. 2 A), and the amount of active LGS was not significantly different from that found in control cells infected with the AdCMV-GFP adenovirus (Fig. 4 A). On the contrary, GK overexpression had a dramatic effect on the capacity of FTO-2B cells to synthesize glycogen. At high glucose concentrations, AdCMV-GK-infected cells produced over 2-fold more glycogen than control cells or cells overexpressing HK I (Fig. 2 A). In contrast to control cells, in GK-expressing cells, endogenous GS was activated by Glc-6-P in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.4AA). Interestingly the large increase in the amount of active LGS in the AdCMV-GK-infected cells was attained at similar or even lower levels of Glc-6-P than those found in HK I-overexpressing cells (Fig. 4 A). However, as indicated above, no GS activation was observed in HK I-overexpressing cells. Overexpression of LGS up to 3-fold did not increase glycogen deposition even when infected FTO-2B cells were incubated with high doses of glucose (Fig. 2 B). Overexpressed LGS behaved like the endogenous enzyme in the sense that it was not activated in response to an increase in the intracellular concentration of Glc-6-P (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, when MGS was expressed to attain the same total GS activity as with LGS, there was a marked increase in glycogen deposition (Fig. 2 C) in response to increasing doses of glucose. Although LGS or MGS overexpression did not alter Glc-6-P concentrations (Fig. 3, B and C), the amount of active GS was much larger in AdCMV-MGS-infected cells and increased linearly with Glc-6-P concentration (Fig.4 B). To compare the effect on glycogen synthesis of the overexpression of LGS or MGS concomitantly with each of the two hexokinases, we overexpressed LGS plus HK I or GK, and MGS plus HK I or GK. In FTO-2B cells overexpressing LGS plus GK, glycogen synthesis was strongly enhanced (Fig. 2 B) compared with control cells or cells overexpressing LGS alone. In contrast, when LGS was overexpressed concomitantly with HK I glycogen deposition in response to increasing doses of glucose remained negligible (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore LGS was very efficiently activated by Glc-6-P in a dose-dependent manner when GK was present but only experienced a minor activation when the source of Glc-6-P was overexpressed HK I (Fig. 4 C). When MGS was co-expressed with GK or HK I, glycogen synthesis was strongly enhanced compared with the cells overexpressing MGS alone. In both cases, glycogen accumulation increased in response to glucose (Fig. 2 C), and the levels of active GS (Fig. 4 D) increased with Glc-6-P in a dose-dependent manner independently of the hexokinase activity present in the cells. In contrast to what occurs with LGS, both hexokinases, HK I and GK, appeared to be equally effective in mediating the activation of MGS in response to glucose. The differences observed in the amount of glycogen and in the levels of active GS between the cells overexpressing MGS and HK I and those expressing MGS and GK can be attributed to the simultaneous activation of the endogenous LGS in the latter case. In liver and muscle, GS activation occurs through the dephosphorylation of the enzyme, which is probably produced by protein phosphatases of type I (2Roach P.J. Cheng C. Huang D. Lin A., Mu, J. Skurat A.V. Wilson W. Zhai L. J. Basic Clin. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1998; 9: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Bollen M. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and is enhanced by Glc-6-P. It is generally accepted that this metabolite binds to GS and triggers a conformational change that renders the enzyme a better substrate for protein phosphatases (1Villar-Palası́ C. Guinovart J.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 544-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Previous studies by our group, using cultured hepatocytes, have shown that Glc-6-P arising from the catalytic action of GK is much more effective in mediating the activation of LGS than the same metabolite produced by HK I (6O'Doherty R.M.

In the present work we have taken advantage of the biochemical features of the FTO-2B cells to show that LGS but not MGS differentiates between Glc-6-P produced by GK or by HK I. Using specific antibodies, here we show that FTO-2B cells express high levels of LGS and do not express measurable levels of MGS. However, these cells do not express GK, the main glucose-phosphorylating enzyme in hepatocytes, and instead express HK I, a ubiquitous hexokinase. Because of these characteristics, this system is ideally suited to study the dependence of GS activation on the source of Glc-6-P. It has already been reported that FTO-2B cells do not accumulate glycogen when incubated with glucose but that the overexpression of GK restores this ability (12Valera A. Bosch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that the large increment in the levels of Glc-6-P derived from the expression of GK was solely responsible for this. However, here we show that the source of this metabolite is also crucial. In the first set of experiments, the adenovirus-mediated overexpression of GK led to the activation of the endogenous LGS present in FTO-2B cells and to the consequent accumulation of glycogen. In contrast, the overexpression of HK I, such that similar levels of Glc-6-P were attained, had no effect on the amount of active GS and glycogen content. The observation that endogenous LGS was activated in response to increasing concentrations of glucose when GK was present but not when the source of Glc-6-P was HK I indicates the existence of at least two pools of Glc-6-P inside the cell. One of these pools is replenished by the action of GK and is accessible to LGS, while the pool of Glc-6-P produced by HK I is localized to a cellular compartment from which LGS is excluded. The second set of experiments, in which we overexpressed LGS and MGS, corroborated this conclusion. The overexpression of LGS did not have any effect on the levels of glycogen. Glc-6-P produced by the endogenous HK I of the FTO-2B cells did not facilitate the dephosphorylation and activation of overexpressed LGS. However, exogenous MGS was effectively activated in response to glucose, and MGS-overexpressing cells synthesized a large amount of glycogen. This finding indicates that, in contrast to LGS, MGS has access to the compartment where the Glc-6-P produced by HK I is directed. The third set of experiments, consisting of double infections with each of the two GS isoforms combined with each one of the two glucose-phosphorylating enzymes, further confirms the previous conclusions and allows us to make one additional conclusion. LGS was only activated by glucose when GK was present, but Glc-6-P produced by GK or HK I was equally effective in inducing the activation of MGS. Simultaneous overexpression of LGS and HK I had no net effect on glycogen deposition, while the co-expression of LGS and GK led to a much larger accumulation of glycogen than in FTO-2B cells singly infected with the AdCMV-GS or AdCMV-GK viruses. In contrast, glycogen accumulation was enhanced in FTO-2B cells overexpressing MGS when the glucose phosphorylating capacity of the cells was also increased regardless of whether the source of Glc-6-P was HK I or GK. On the basis of the different effectiveness in inducing the activation of LGS by the Glc-6-P produced by GK or by HK I, the channeling of this sugar phosphate from GK to GS was hypothesized. However, in the light of the new data presented here, an alternative hypothesis emerges: compartmentation of Glc-6-P. GK delivers its product into a cellular compartment, which is accessible by several enzymes that use Glc-6-P, while the compartment where the Glc-6-P produced by HK I is directed has a more restricted access. In this study we show that overexpression of GK in FTO-2B cells enhances glycogen deposition irrespectively of the GS isoform present. Glycolysis, which is an alternative metabolic fate of Glc-6-P, is also greatly stimulated in GK-overexpressing FTO-2B cells (12Valera A. Bosch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In cultured hepatocytes (6O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D.L. Seoane J. Gómez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol.

Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1392-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), GK overexpression also stimulates both processes, glycogen deposition and glycolysis. On the contrary, Glc-6-P produced by HK I is not sensed by LGS and therefore is not used for the synthesis of glycogen even when the intracellular levels of this metabolite are substantially increased. The four enzymes overexpressed in this study have been shown to change their intracellular distribution in response to glucose. In the absence of the sugar, GK is localized to the nucleus of the hepatocyte but moves into the cytosol when the levels of glucose increase (21de la Iglesia N. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. Guinovart J.J. Ferrer J.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Mukhtar M. Stubbs M. Agius L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). MGS is also concentrated in the nucleus at low glucose and translocates to the cytosol, where it adopts a particulate pattern, at high glucose concentrations (5Ferrer J.C. Baqué S. Guinovart J.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 14Cid E. Gomis R.R. Geremı́a R.A. Guinovart J.J. Ferrer J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33614-33621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast, LGS presents a cytosolic distribution in the absence of glucose and concentrates at the periphery of the hepatocyte when the concentration of the hexose increases (27Garcı́a-Rocha M. Roca A. de La Iglesia N. Baba O. Fernández-Novell J.M. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Finally HK I has been shown to reversibly bind to the outer mitochondrial membrane through a hydrophobic N-terminal sequence (28Polakis P.G. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 236: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This association, which is at least in part controlled by the intracellular levels of Glc-6-P, plays a role in the regulation of HK I activity in vivo. Low levels of Glc-6-P favor the association with mitochondria and stimulate HK I activity, while high levels of this metabolite have the opposite effect (29Wilson J.E. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 126: 65-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HK I, which accounts for more than 75% of total hexokinase activity present in skeletal muscle (30Wilson J.E. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and MGS are, respectively, at the beginning and at the end of the glycogen synthetic pathway in muscle. Therefore, the ability of HK I to mediate the glucose-induced activation of MGS has a clear physiological meaning. The high affinity of HK I for glucose implies that this sugar is readily converted into Glc-6-P upon entering the cell, and thus the pair HK I-MGS is sensitive to the low concentrations of glucose present in the muscle cell. This explains why the control of glycogen deposition in muscle does not reside in the glucose phosphorylating capacity of the cell but rather in the insulin-stimulated import of the sugar by the GLUT-4 transporter and in the MGS (9Azpiazu I. Manchester J. Skurat A.V. Roach P.J. Lawrence J.C. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 278: 234-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the situation in the liver is rather different. In the hepatocyte, extracellular glucose and intracellular glucose are in equilibrium partly due to the high capacity of the hepatic glucose transporter GLUT-2 (31Bell G.I. Burant C.F. Takeda J. Gould G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19161-19164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although GK represents the main glucose phosphorylating activity of the hepatocyte, HK I is also present at considerable levels (32Cárdenas M.L. Cornish-Bowden A. Ureta T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 242-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). When blood glucose levels are low (below ∼5 mm), there is no significant flux through GK because of its high K m for glucose (32Cárdenas M.L. Cornish-Bowden A. Ureta T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 242-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and to the action of its regulatory protein, which further decreases the apparent affinity of GK for glucose in the hepatocyte (22Bontemps F. Hue L. Hers H.G. Biochem. J. 1974; 174: 603-611Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, under these conditions only HK I can phosphorylate glucose, but as shown in this study, the Glc-6-P thus produced cannot be diverted toward the synthesis of glycogen since this metabolite does not activate LGS. Only when blood sugar concentration increases above a threshold level does GK translocate to the cytosol and start to produce Glc-6-P, thus giving the signal that triggers the synthesis of hepatic glycogen. In this case, the control of glycogen synthesis is not exerted by glucose transport but rather by GK and GS (8Gomis R.R. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It appears that the inability of the Glc-6-P produced by HK I to stimulate the activation of LGS is one way for the hepatocyte to ensure that hepatic glycogen synthesis is only engaged when needed, that is when blood glucose levels are high. We conclude that the characteristics of the two pairs of isoenzymes LGS/GK and MGS/HK I and the relationships that they establish are tailored to suit specific metabolic roles of the tissues in which they are expressed.

Potential PLAG1 binding sites were found in the promoter of many genes and notably in the promoter 3 of the human insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) gene for which we have proved that it is a bona fide PLAG1 target gene (5Voz M.L. Agten N.S. Van de Ven W.J. Kas K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 106-113PubMed Google Scholar). 2Hensen, K., Van Valckenborgh, I. C., Kas, K., Van de Ven, W. J., and Voz, M. L. (2002) Cancer Res.62, 1510–1517. PLAG1 is a member of the highly conserved PLAG subfamily of zinc finger proteins comprising two other members, PLAGL1 (also called LOT1 or ZAC1) and PLAGL2 (4Kas K.

PLAGL2 is able to bind to the consensus binding site of PLAG1, and IGF-II is a target of both PLAG1 and PLAGL2.2 PLAG1 and PLAGL2 both are able to transform NIH-3T3 cells in vitro, indicating they are genuine proto-oncogenes.2 In contrast, PLAGL1 inhibits tumor cell growth through the induction of apoptotic cell death and G1arrest and recognizes a different consensus binding site (9Varrault A. Ciani E. Apiou F. Bilanges B. Hoffmann A. Pantaloni C. Bockaert J. Spengler D. Journot L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8835-8840Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To gain more insight into the regulation of PLAG1 function, a mouse embryonic cDNA library was screened for PLAG1-interacting proteins in the yeast two-hybrid assay system. We used an embryonic library, because PLAG1 is expressed mainly during embryonic development. We opted to screen with the N-terminal tail of PLAG1 for two reasons. First, this region has a high surface probability as predicted by the Protean program (DNAstar), indicating its availability for interaction with other proteins. Second, in contrast to the DNA-binding zinc finger domain and the trans-activating C-terminal domain, no function had been assigned to the N-terminal part of PLAG1. Proteins interacting with this region might reveal new aspects of PLAG1 function. The screen revealed interaction between PLAG1 and karyopherin α2, a protein involved in active nuclear import. This interaction provided the basis for the identification of a karyopherin α2 recognition site in PLAG1, which functions as a nuclear localization signal. GST-PLAG1-(2–244) and GST-PLAG1-(84–244) were described previously (5Voz M.L. Agten N.S. Van de Ven W.J. Kas K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 106-113PubMed Google Scholar, 10Debiec-Rychter M. Van Valckenborgh I. Van Den Broeck C. Hagemeijer A. Van De Ven W.J. Kas K. Van Damme B. Voz M.L. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). GST-PLAGL1-(2–215) and GST-PLAGL2-(2–250) deletion mutants were constructed by PCR cloning and subsequent ligation into the EcoRI/XhoI sites (as underlined in the primers) of the pGEX-5X-2 vector and verified by sequencing. To clone PLAGL1-(2–215), the following PCR primers were used: P2N2, 5′-CCCGAATTCTGGCCACGTTCCCCTGCC-3′, and P2C215, 5′-GGGCTCGAGCTAGCTCTCTTTCATCAGCTCC-3′. To clone PLAGL2-(2–250), the following PCR primers were used: P3N2, 5′-CCCGAATTCTGACCACATTTTTCACCAGCG-3′, and P3C250, 5′-GGGCTCGAGCTACTTGATCTTGAGCAGCTCCT-3′. All sequences are 5′ to 3′, and the direction forward (N) or reverse (C) is indicated. To obtain the PLAG1 bait construct used in the yeast two-hybrid assay, we cloned the PLAG1 fragment of the GST-PLAG1-(2–244) construct into the BamHI/PstI sites of pGBT9 (CLONTECH). This plasmid was again digested with StyI (cutting PLAG1 at 209 bp in the open reading frame) and PstI, blunt-ended, and religated, generating pGBT9-PLAG1-(2–70). β-Galactosidase-PLAG1-GFP fusion constructs for intracellular fluorescence studies were prepared by cloning PCR fragments amplified from the pCDNA3-PLAG1 expression construct (5Voz M.L. Agten N.S. Van de Ven W.J. Kas K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 106-113PubMed Google Scholar) into the SacII/XbaI sites of pHM829 (11Sorg G. Stamminger T. Biotechniques. 1999; 26: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The following primers were used: SacII-Plag1N2, 5′-AGTCCCGCGGGCCACTGTCATTCCTGGTG-3′;SacII-Plag1N41, 5′-AGTCCCGCGGAAGGCCTTTAACAGTGTTGAG-3′;SacII-Plag1N242, 5′-AGTCCCGCGGAAGGTCAAAACAGAACCAGTG-3′;XbaI-Plag1C500, 5′-ACTGTCTAGACTGAAAAGCTTGATGGAAAC-3′;XbaI-Plag1C41, 5′-ACAGTCTAGACTTGTCACACAGTTGGCAAG-3′; and XbaI-Plag1C241, 5′-ACTGTCTAGACAGAAGCTCTTGATTGTGAC-3′. To clone the putative NLS1 (SGKRKR GE) into the SacII/XbaI site of pHM829 vector, the following oligonucleotides were used: oligoNLSup, 5′-GGTCAGGGAAACGTAAGCGTGGTGAAT-3′, and oligoNLSlow, 5′-CTAGATTCACCACGCTTACGTTTCCCTGACCGC-3′. Mutations of the NLS motifs within GST-PLAG1-(N2-C244), β-galactosidase-PLAG1-(2–500)-GFP, and β-galactosidase-PLAG1-(2–42)-GFP constructs were performed as described in the Stratagene protocol for PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. To mutate the first candidate NLS motif22KRKR25 into22KAAR25, the following primers were used: mutaNLS1-up, 5′-CCTTCAGGGAAAGCTGCGCGTGGTGAAACC-3′, and mutaNLS1-low, 5′-GGTTTCACCACGCGCAGCTTTCCCTGAAGG-3′. To mutate the second candidate NLS motif 29KPKR32 into29KPAA32, we used the following primers: mutaNLS2-up, 5′-GGTGAAACCAAACCAGCAGCTAACTTTCCTTGCCAAC-3′, and mutaNLS2-low, 5′-GTTGGCAAGGAAAGTTAGCTGCTTGGTTTGGTTTCACC-3′. The frame and mutations in all of the newly synthesized constructs were verified by sequencing. The Matchmaker Two-hybrid System 2 was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). All experiments were performed in the yeast reporter strain CG-1945 (Trp− and Leu−). The “bait” construct consisted of the N-terminal part of human PLAG1- (N2-C70) cloned into the yeast vector pGBT9 (CLONTECH). This vector allows the fusion of the protein of interest to the C-terminal end of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and contains TRP1 reporter gene for selection of transformants. The PLAG1 bait construct did not show autonomous transcriptional activation and hence was a good candidate for the detection of protein interactions in the yeast two-hybrid transcriptional activation assay. An oligo(dT)− and randomly primed “prey” cDNA library from 12.5-day-old embryonic mice cloned into the pACT2 vector was kindly provided by Drs. K. Verschueren and D. Huylebroeck (University of Leuven and Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology, Belgium). The pACT2 vector allows the fusion of proteins to the C-terminal end of the major GAL4 activation domain and contains LEU2 for selection of transformants. 1 × 109 CG-1945 yeast were transformed with 66 μg of bait-DNA and 33 μg of prey-library-DNA using a LiAc high efficiency transformation protocol (12Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). This yeast strain contains the HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes under the control of promoters containing GAL4 binding sites. Transformants were grown for 10 days at 30 °C on triple selective (lacking Trp, Leu, and His) synthetic dropout (SD−) agar plates containing 5 mm 3-aminotriazol (Sigma). Double transformed His+ yeast colonies were restreaked on new SD− agar plates and grown for another 24–48 h. For the qualitative measurement of β-galactosidase activity, colony lift filter assays were performed according to standard protocols. Plasmid DNA was isolated from positive (blue) colonies by glass bead lysis, extraction with phenol/chloroform, and ethanol precipitation and subsequently used to transform the Escherichia coli strain HB101 (Leu−) by electroporation. pACT2 plasmids containing different inserts as analyzed by PCR amplification and BglII digestion were reassayed by cotransformation into yeast-competent cells with either the PLAG1-pGBT9 construct, the empty pGBT9 vector, or pGBT9 containing an unrelated cDNA insert (human lamin C) shown to interact in a two-hybrid assay with an independent protein. Plasmids that generated colonies on SD− agar plates and were only positive in the X-gal filter assay with the PLAG1 bait construct were considered for further analysis. Full-length murine karyopherin α2 cDNA in the pET15b vector (generously provided by Dr. M. Waterman, Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, College of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA) was used to prepare in vitro synthesized [35S]methionine-labeled karyopherin α2 protein. The in vitro translation reaction was carried out using the TNT T7 Quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Bacterial expression constructs were made using the pGEX-5X-2 vector, directing the synthesis of GST fused to different parts of PLAG1. The fusion proteins were purified according to supplier's instructions and verified by SDS-PAGE. The different PLAG1 fusion proteins or GST alone as negative control were bound to glutathione-agarose beads. Equal amounts of these GST fusion proteins (∼20 μg) were incubated with 10 μl of in vitro synthesized [35S]methionine-labeled full-length karyopherin α2 protein in 500 μl of NENT500 buffer (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). This mixture was tumbled for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the beads were washed four times in 500 μl of NENT500 buffer, resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and incubated at 95 °C for 2 min. Proteins were size-separated on SDS-PAGE, and interacting karyopherin α2 was detected by autoradiography. A pleomorphic adenoma with a translocation involving chromosome 8q12 (t(3;8)(p21;q12)), the reciprocal translocations with breakpoints at chromosome 3p21 and 8q12 was retrieved from the tumor bank of the Center for Human Genetics (University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium). It was a primary tumor originating from the salivary gland of a previously untreated patient. Primary in situ cultures were obtained from the original single cell suspension of tumor cells and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (1:1) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. These cells were subsequently grown to 40–60% confluency on chamber slides (Lab-Tek®), and immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (10Debiec-Rychter M. Van Valckenborgh I. Van Den Broeck C. Hagemeijer A. Van De Ven W.J. Kas K. Van Damme B. Voz M.L. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In short, the slides were fixed in cold acetone followed by methanol (5 min each) and air-dried. Cells were then permeabilized and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.5% blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the slides were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-PLAG1 antibody (PEM190) (10Debiec-Rychter M. Van Valckenborgh I. Van Den Broeck C. Hagemeijer A. Van De Ven W.J. Kas K. Van Damme B. Voz M.L. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) followed by washes in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (3 × 10 min), incubation with Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences), and again washes (three times). Finally, the slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) supplemented with 0.4 μg/ml 4′-6-diamine-2-phenylinidole-dihydrochloride (DAPI, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and analyzed on a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope equipped with a cooled digital CCD camera system (Photometrics) using SmartCaptureTM software. 293T human embryonic kidney epithelial cells were used to examine the expression and subcellular localization of β-galactosidase-PLAG1-GFP fusion proteins. Cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (1:1) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere. Transient transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the supplier's instructions. The cells were grown to 70–80% confluency on coverslips in 24-well plates. For each transfection 0.75 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent in 25 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) was added to 0.5 μg of DNA and incubated at room temperature for 15 min after which the mixture was applied directly to the growth medium of the cells. Cells were incubated further at 37 °C for 18–24 h followed by fixation in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature and three subsequent wash steps in phosphate-buffered saline. Finally, the slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) supplemented with 1/1000 DAPI and analyzed under the fluorescence microscope. The yeast two-hybrid assay was used to identify proteins interacting with the N-terminal part of PLAG1-(2–70) (Fig. 1). Approximately 160,000 colonies were screened on triple selective (lacking Trp, Leu, and His) agar and subsequently on X-gal filters. Thirty colonies were retained as candidates for specifying PLAG1-interacting proteins. Different prey plasmids were isolated from these yeast colonies. The plasmids were subsequently reassayed by cotransformation into yeast-competent cells with either the PLAG1 pGBT9 construct, the empty pGBT9, or pGBT9 containing an unrelated cDNA insert. Three independent prey plasmids generated yeasts that were able to grow on SD− agar plates and that were only positive in the X-gal filter assay with the PLAG1 bait construct. All three prey plasmids contained an insert of ∼2 kb, which upon nucleotide sequence analysis appeared to encode mouse karyopherin α2 (GenBankTMaccession number AAH06720) starting at amino acid 38. This N-terminal truncated protein lacks a part of the importin β-binding domain but still contains the armadillo repeats responsible for the binding to the NLS. To confirm the physical interaction between karyopherin α2 and PLAG1, we carried out a GST pull-down assay using in vitro translated full-length mouse [35S]karyopherin α2 and PLAG-(2–244) fused to GST. As shown in Fig. 2, karyopherin α2 bound strongly to GST-PLAG1-(2–244), while it did not bind to GST used as a control. Moreover, GST-PLAG1-(84–244), lacking the N-terminal PLAG1 segment used in the two-hybrid screen, failed to interact with karyopherin α2. Together, these results confirm the interaction between karyopherin α2 and PLAG1 identified in the two-hybrid assay and moreover show that this interaction is specific for the N-terminal region PLAG1-(2–84). As PLAG1 is a member of the highly conserved PLAG subfamily of zinc finger proteins, which includes PLAGL1 and PLAGL2, we were interested in whether these proteins could interact with karyopherin α2. To determine this possibility, we studied the interaction of karyopherin α2 with PLAGL1 and PLAGL2 in a GST pull-down experiment. As shown in Fig. 2, GST-PLAGL1-(2–215) and GST-PLAGL2-(2–250) did not interact with karyopherin α2 in contrast with the strong interaction between GST-PLAG1-(2–244) and karyopherin α2. Karyopherin α2 is implicated in active nuclear import of various proteins via interaction with a NLS (13Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), consisting of short stretches of basic amino acids. The identification of karyopherin α2 as a PLAG1-interacting protein suggests that the interaction is mediated via a nuclear localization signal in PLAG1. An analysis of PLAG1 on the Psort server (psort.nibb.ac.jp/) identified two candidate NLS consensus signals, KRKR and KPKR, positioned at amino acids 22–25 and 29–32, respectively (Fig. 1). Previous studies have shown that mutagenesis of the basic residues within an NLS motif eliminates karyopherin α2 recognition. Therefore, we mutated the candidate NLS motifs in GST-PLAG1-(2–244) by replacing two basic residues with alanines and analyzed the PLAG1-karyopherin α2 interaction in a GST pull-down assay (Fig. 3). The mutation of putative NLS1 of PLAG1 eliminated the interaction with karyopherin α2 (mNLS1). In contrast, the mutation of the predicted NLS2 did not affect the binding of karyopherin α2 to GST-PLAG1 (mNLS2). As expected, the mutation of both predicted NLSs eliminated the interaction between PLAG1 and karyopherin α2 (mNLS1+2). These data show that NLS1 of PLAG1 is involved in karyopherin α2 interaction, whereas NLS2 is not. Because karyopherin α2 is involved in active nuclear import via physical interaction with its cargo, PLAG1 is likely to be such a cargo protein and therefore is expected to localize to the nucleus. We recently showed that exogenous PLAG1 transfected in COS-1 kidney fibroblast cells is localized in the nucleus (5Voz M.L. Agten N.S. Van de Ven W.J. Kas K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 106-113PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, immunofluorescence on cultured pleomorphic adenoma cells of the salivary gland with PLAG1-specific antibodies shows nuclear localization of the endogenous PLAG1 protein (Fig. 4). To assess the role of the predicted NLSs in vivo, we monitored the intracellular localization in 293T cells of various β-galactosidase-PLAG1-GFP fusion proteins by fluorescence microscopy. Whereas wild-type PLAG1 fusion protein was found exclusively in the nucleus of all transfected cells (Fig. 5, panel A), the mutation of putative NLS1 resulted in a heterogenic picture with 56% of the cells showing only nuclear fluorescence, 28% only cytoplasmic, and 16% both nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence (Fig. 5, panel B). The mutation of predicted NLS2 had no effect on the nuclear localization of the fusion protein (Fig. 5, panel C). The effect of the mutation in NLS1 was even more pronounced when we fused only the N-terminal segment of PLAG1-(2–41) to β-galactosidase and GFP. A complete shift from exclusively nuclear localization for the wild-type fusion (Fig. 5, panel E) to exclusively cytoplasmic localization for the NLS1 mutant (Fig. 5, panel F) was observed. Again, the mutation of predicted NLS2 resulted in a picture indistinguishable from the wild-type fusion (Fig. 5,panel G). In addition, the fusion of only eight amino acids including the predicted NLS1 (SGKRKR GE) to the β-galactosidase-GFP converted this exclusively cytoplasmic protein to an exclusively nuclear one (Fig. 5, panel I). Taken together, these results show the functional importance of NLS1 for active nuclear import of PLAG1, whereas we could not demonstrate a role for NLS2.Figure 5The intracellular localization of various β-galactosidase-PLAG1-GFP fusion proteins in transiently transfected 293T cells. Fluorescence of 293T cells transfected with β-galactosidase-PLAG1-(full-length, wild-type)-GFP (A); β-galactosidase-PLAG1-(full-length, NLS1-mutated)-GFP (B); β-galactosidase-PLAG1-(full-length, NLS2-mutated)-GFP (C); β-galactosidase-PLAG1-(full-length, NLS1- and NLS2-mutated)-GFP (D); β-galactosidase-PLAG1-(2–41, wild-type)-GFP (E); β-galactosidase-PLAG1-(2–41, NLS1-mutated)-GFP (F); β-galactosidase-PLAG1-(2–41, NLS2-mutated)-GFP (G); β-galactosidase-PLAG1-(2–41, NLS1- and NLS2-mutated)-GFP (H); β-galactosidase-(SGKRKRGE)-GFP (I); β-galactosidase-PLAG1-(244–500)-GFP (J); and β-galactosidase-PLAG1-(42–242)-GFP (K). All nuclei showed blue fluorescence after DAPI staining. The intracellular localization of the corresponding β-galactosidase-PLAG1-GFP fusion proteins in terms of percentage is shown in the table. For each different fusion protein around 100 cells was evaluated by fluorescent microscopy and classified as having either green fluorescence exclusively in the nucleus (N) or exclusively in the cytoplasm (C) or both in nucleus and cytoplasm (N + C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The mutation of the predicted NLS1 in the context of full-length PLAG1 protein fused to β-galactosidase and GFP did not completely inhibit nuclear import as shown above. Indeed, 72% of the transfected cells still showed nuclear localization of the fusion proteins (Fig. 5). In contrast, the same NLS1 mutation in the N-terminal segment of PLAG1-(2–41) fully inhibited nuclear import. These results indicate the presence of another motif in PLAG1 that can determine active nuclear localization independently of NLS1. To pinpoint this motif, several PLAG1 deletion constructs were assessed for nuclear import. A β-galactosidase-PLAG1-GFP fusion protein containing the C-terminal activation domain PLAG1-(244–500) failed to enter the nucleus (Fig. 5,panel J). On the other hand, the fusion of the zinc finger domain without the N-terminal part PLAG1-(41–242) gave a heterogenic picture (Fig. 5, panel K) with 47% of the transfected cells showing exclusive nuclear fluorescence, 33% exclusive cytoplasmic, and 20% both nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence (Fig. 5). As such, these data assign a functional role in nuclear import to this region despite its apparent lack of an NLS motif and its failure to interact with karyopherin α2 in the GST pull-down assay (Fig. 2,GST-PLAG1-(84–244)). Karyopherin α2 or Kpna2 (also called pendulin) (GenbankTM accession number AAH06720), a member of the importin family, was identified as a PLAG1-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Karyopherin α2 is implicated in active nuclear import of various proteins by interaction with a NLS (13Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). A conventional nuclear localization sequence consists of short stretches of basic amino acids, either a single stretch (i.e. monopartite NLS) or two stretches separated by a spacer region (i.e. bipartite). Importin α proteins deliver their NLS-tagged cargo into the nucleus through interaction with importin β. Importin β docks the karyopherin-cargo complex with the nuclear pore followed by translocation of the complex through the pore via an energy-dependent process. In the nucleus the karyopherin/cargo complex dissociates, after which the karyopherins recycle to the cytoplasm. Karyopherin α2 consists of an N-terminal hydrophilic importin β-binding domain (14Gorlich D. Henklein P. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1810-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 15Moroianu J. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1818-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and a hydrophobic central region composed of armadillo repeats, which bind to the NLS motif (17Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A.B.

The results presented here reveal the presence of two regions in PLAG1 that independently determine nuclear localization. The first one is the predicted NLS1 in the N-terminal part of PLAG1 that mediates nuclear import through interaction with karyopherin α2. The second is the zinc finger domain of PLAG1, which is responsible for DNA binding. This domain can also localize the protein to the nucleus, although no candidate NLS consensus signals could be identified using Psort. The mechanism by which this domain targets PLAG1 to the nucleus, either by direct interaction with one of the several importin α proteins or indirectly via proteins that bind to the zinc finger domain, is still unknown. Such redundancy in nuclear targeting is not uncommon for transcription factors, enzymes, or structural proteins whose nuclear import is essential. A seemingly superfluous NLS was found in the 42-kDa B-cell-specific activator protein. The N-terminal DNA-binding domain termed the paired box and a defined NLS in the central domain of B-cell-specific activator protein are redundant in nuclear targeting of B-cell-specific activator protein (20Kovac C.R. Emelyanov A. Singh M. Ashouian N. Birshtein B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16752-16757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Multiple functional NLSs were identified in DNA topoisomerases I, IIα, and IIβ (21Mirski S.E. Gerlach J.H. Cole S.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Mo Y.Y. Wang C. Beck W.T. J. Biol.

Doenecke D. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 206-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The contribution of passive diffusion in nuclear localization of PLAG1 has not yet been established. With a molecular mass of 55 kDa, PLAG1 might be able to pass through nuclear pores by diffusion. Nevertheless, small proteins are often equipped with NLSs to ensure fast nuclear accumulation by active transport. The results presented in this work focus on active transport, because fusion to β-galactosidase and GFP adds an additional 102 kDa (75 and 27 kDa, respectively) to the molecular mass, thus severely impairing if not completely preventing passive diffusion. The PLAG1 family members PLAGL1 and PLAGL2 did not interact with karyopherin α2 in vitro. In addition, an analysis with Psort did not reveal candidate NLS consensus signals in PLAGL1 or PLAGL2. Nevertheless, both are shown to be nuclear proteins (9Varrault A. Ciani E. Apiou F. Bilanges B. Hoffmann A. Pantaloni C. Bockaert J. Spengler D. Journot L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8835-8840Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 24Furukawa T. Adachi Y. Fujisawa J. Kambe T. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Sasaki R. Kuwahara J. Ikehara S. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4718-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), in agreement with their function as transcription factors. It is possible that their zinc finger domain is responsible for their nuclear import. As a result of alternative splicing of PLAG1, different isoforms of the protein are predicted starting either at methionine 83 or methionine 100. These truncated PLAG1 products lack the identified NLS and do not bind to karyopherin α2 in a GST pull-down assay. In these isoforms, the zinc finger domain probably ensures nuclear targeting. The fact that PLAG1 is equipped with an extra NLS absent in the other PLAG family members and in the PLAG1 isoforms suggests that its nuclear import might be of particular physiological relevance. Indeed, the nuclear targeting directed by NLS1 is more efficient in comparison to the nuclear targeting by the zinc finger domain. A cytoplasmic protein is driven to the nucleus in 100% of the cells after fusion to NLS1. Introduction of the DNA-binding domain of PLAG1, in contrast, confers nuclear localization in only 47% of the cells (see table in Fig. 5). However, it is not yet clear why PLAG1 needs a highly efficient mechanism for nuclear import mediated by NLS1, which is in contrast to the other family members and the isoforms that lack the identified NLS. It would not be surprising to learn that the extra NLS of PLAG1 has some yet uncharacterized physiological role. A nuclear localization signal in chicken heat shock transcription factor 3 (cHSF), for example, targets the protein to the nucleus and in addition is essential for its stress-induced dimer-to-trimer transition (25Nakai A. Ishikawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34665-34671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the context of the whole cell, the interaction between PLAG1 and karyopherin α2 is not exclusive. PLAG1 has to compete with other NLS-containing cargo proteins for karyopherin α2 in order to be transported into the nucleus. Some import substrates such as small nuclear ribonuclear proteins, histones, and ribosomal subunits are imported into the nucleus in high but relatively constant amounts, whereas other import substrates such as transcription factors are only required in the nucleus for short periods in small amounts in response to specific cellular signals. The mechanisms inducing rapid changes in signal binding affinity such as phosphorylation or intermolecular masking are essential to ensure dynamic exchanges between nucleus and cytoplasm. In the case of PLAG1, it seems that the protein uses the nuclear import machinery to transport all of the highly overexpressed PLAG1 protein into the nucleus despite the competition with other cargo proteins. Therefore, it seems that either PLAG1 is not regulated at the level of nuclear import and is always rapidly transported into the nucleus to affect its target genes or the mechanism that decreases the binding affinity and allows competition of other NLS-containing proteins is not functional in 293T cells."

The short CGG repeating DNA derived from folate-sensitive fragile sites has been shown to exclude single nucleosomes. To test whether this nucleosome exclusion model provides a general molecular mechanism for the formation of fragile sites, a different class of fragile site, the 33-base pair AT-rich repeating DNAs derived from the rare distamycin-inducible site, FRA16B, was examined for its ability to assemble single nucleosomes and nucleosome arrays using in vitro nucleosome reconstitution methods. The FRA16B DNA fragments strongly exclude nucleosome assembly only in the presence of distamycin, and increasing the number of 33-bp repeats increases the effect of distamycin in the destabilization of the nucleosome formation, suggesting a common mechanism for the formation of fragile sites.

Fragile sites are chromosomal abnormalities in humans and are linked to the incidence of certain cancers and other severe disorders. Cytologically they are defined as sites of poor staining, gaps, or DNA strand breakage in metaphase chromosomes when cells are treated under specific culture conditions. To date, more than 100 different types of fragile sites have been identified in the human genome, classified as common or rare and further divided according to the agents used to identify them in cultured cells (1.Sutherland G.R. GATA. 1991; 8: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The rare fragile sites are classified into the folate-sensitive, distamycin A-inducible and bromodeoxyuridine-inducible groups, whereas the common fragile sites include the aphidicolin-, 5-azacytidine-, and bromodeoxyuridine-inducible groups (1.Sutherland G.R. GATA. 1991; 8: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although the first fragile site was discovered in 1965 (2.Dekaban A. J. Nucl. Med. 1965; 6: 740-746PubMed Google Scholar), the molecular nature of fragile sites is not clear. It has been shown that the locations of many fragile sites are cytogenetically correlated to those of deletion and translocation breakpoints in cancer cells (3.Popescu N.C. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1994; 5: 121-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Also, fragile sites have been mapped at the molecular level to the integration sites of oncogenic viruses (4.Wilke M.C. Hall B.K. Hoge A. Paradee W. Smith D.I. Glover T.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is critical to investigate the nature of the DNA sequence and structure where fragile sites are located in order to understand how viruses find the fragile site and why fragile sites are preferential loci for deletion and translocation. FRAXA, one of the folate-sensitive fragile sites, has been studied extensively because of its direct association with fragile X syndrome, one of the most common forms of inherited mental retardation (5.Fu Y.H.

Using a combination of electron microscopy (EM) 1The abbreviations used are: EMelectron microscopyntnucleotide(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionRSFremodeling and spacing factor and competitive nucleosome reconstitution assays, we showed that expanded CCG repeats strongly exclude nucleosomes in vitro (12.Wang Y.-H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22937-22940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), thus providing a possible molecular explanation for the basis of fragile sites in chromosomes. Further, we showed that a DNA motif (CCGNN)n based on the CCG repeat excludes nucleosomesin vitro (15.Wang Y.-H. Griffith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1999; 19: 7661-7671Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, we suggest that the formation of the folate-sensitive fragile site results from the inability of DNA at this site to fold properly or compactly into chromosomes during metaphase. electron microscopy nucleotide(s) polymerase chain reaction remodeling and spacing factor To examine whether this model of nucleosome exclusion is specific for the folate-sensitive sites or a common mechanism for other classes of fragile sites, DNAs from a distamycin A-inducible fragile site, FRA16B, were tested for their ability to assemble into nucleosomes. FRA16B is a rare distamycin A-inducible fragile site located on chromosome 16 and found in about 1 in 40 chromosomes in the European population (17.Sutherland G.R. Jacky P.B. Baker E.G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1984; 36: 110-112PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, DNA sequencing of FRA16B has identified a 33-bp AT-rich repeat (ATATATTATATATTATATCTAATAATATAT(C/A)TA)n. The 33-bp repeat at this site is expanded by as many as 2000 copies in the FRA16B-expressing chromosome com- pared with 7–12 copies found in the general population (18.Yu S. Mangelsdorf M. Hewett D. Hobson L. Baker E. Eyre H. Lapsys N. Paslier D.L. Doggett N.A. Sutherland G.R. Richards R.I. Cell. 1997; 88: 367-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This observation parallels the tendency toward repeat expansion observed in folate-sensitive fragile sites. Here we demonstrate that the 33-bp AT-rich repeats strongly exclude nucleosome formation only in the presence of distamycin. This observation provides strong support for a general model in which nucleosome exclusion creates unstable chromatin at these fragile sites and leads to the formation of gaps, DNA strand breakage, or poor staining in metaphase chromosomes. Two complementary oligonucleotides containing 2 copies of the 33-nt AT-rich FRA16B sequence (5′-ATATATTATATATTATATCTAATAATATATCTAATATATTATATATTATATCTAATAATATATATA-3′ and 5′-ATATTATATATATTATTAGATATAATATATAATATA TTAGATATATTATTAGATATAATATATAAT-3′) were synthesized, annealed to generate a duplex with 4 nucleotide cohesive ends, and ligated head-to-tail. Monomers, dimers, and trimers of the 66-bp AT-rich DNAs (2 copies of the 33-bp FRA16B DNA) were purified by gel electrophoresis and cloned into the pGEM3zf(+) vector (Promega). The sequences of the inserts in the recombinant plasmids pFRA16B1-3 were verified by direct DNA sequencing. HeLa cell histone octamers were isolated as previously described (19.Hsieh C.-H. Griffith J.D. Cell. 1988; 52: 535-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The plasmid containing a human FRA16B sequence was constructed by inserting a 921-bp fragment into the pGEM3zf(+) vector. The 921-bp fragment was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of human genomic DNA with primers 27 and 29 flanking the human FRA16B site (18.Yu S. Mangelsdorf M. Hewett D. Hobson L. Baker E.

Cell. 1997; 88: 367-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) followed by AccI and BglII digestion. A 267-bp fragment containing 2 copies of the 33-bp FRA16B DNA repeat was obtained by PCR amplification of a segment of the pFRA16B1 plasmid using primers from nt 5 to 22 and from nt 182 to 205 (based on the numbering in pGEM3zf(+)). A 266-bp fragment containing 4 copies of the 33-bp FRA16B DNA repeat was obtained by PCR amplification of a segment of the pFRA16B2 plasmid using primers from nt 5 to 22 and from nt 116 to 139 of pGEM3zf(+). A 250-bp fragment containing 6 repeats of the FRA16B DNA was obtained by EcoRI and HindIII digestion of pFRA16B3. A 268-bp fragment containing the (CCGNN)48 repeat was obtained byEcoRI and XbaI digestion of p(CCGNN)48 (15.Wang Y.-H. Griffith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8863-8867Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A 262-bp pUC19 fragment was obtained by PCR amplification of pUC19 plasmid using primers from nt 239 to 263 and from nt 477 to 500 of pUC19. DNA fragments were purified by 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and labeled with T4 DNA kinase (NEB) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). DNA fragments (3 pmol) were mixed with purified HeLa cell histone octamers (2 pmol) in a buffer containing 2 m NaCl. The salt was slowly lowered in increments of 0.1 m to a final concentration of 0.1m by adding a solution of 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 (5 min for each step at room temperature), to form stable nucleosomes. The nucleosome-assembled DNA was fixed with 0.6% glutaraldehyde (v/v) for 10 min at room temperature and chromatographed over 2-ml columns of BIO-GEL A-5m (Bio-Rad) to remove the excess glutaraldehyde. The fractions containing DNA protein complexes were mixed with a buffer containing 2 mmspermidine, applied to glow-charged carbon-coated grids and then washed with a sequential water/ethanol series. The samples were then air-dried and rotary shadowcast with tungsten (12.Wang Y.-H. Gellibolian R. Shimizu M. Wells R.D. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Samples were examined on a Philips 420 electron microscope, and micrographs were taken on sheet film. Fifty nanograms of labeled DNA was mixed with 10 μg of unlabeled calf thymus DNA and 2.5 μg of histone octamers in a solution containing 2 m NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma). The total DNA added is about 4-fold molar excess over the histone octamers. Nucleosome assembly and electrophoresis was carried out as described (20.Wang Y.-H. Griffith J.D. Genomics. 1995; 25: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, nucleosome assembly was accomplished by slowly lowering the salt in increments of 0.1 m to a final concentration of 0.1 m using a solution of 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 (5 min for each step at room temperature). The assembly mixtures were then directly electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide gels to separate free DNA from the nucleosome-assembled DNA. The amount of DNA in each band was determined by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) scanning. For each DNA sample a “no histones” assembly reaction was performed to serve as a control in which the reaction mixture did not contain histone octamers. The DNA was treated in the same manner, including stepwise salt dilution. The free energy of nucleosome assembly was calculated according to the equation E = RTlnK − RTlnQ(12.Wang Y.-H. Gellibolian R. Shimizu M. Wells R.D. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13.Wang Y.-H. Griffith J.D. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 8863-8867Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) where E represents the free energy of assembly of the 33-bp repeat-containing fragment, K is the ratio of DNA in complex to free DNA for pUC19 fragment, and Qis the ratio of DNA in complex to free DNA for the 33-bp repeat-containing fragment. The free energy for the pUC19 DNA was defined as zero. The values are derived from three separate experiments. Distamycin A (Sigma) at a concentration of 100 μm was added to an equal volume of DNA sample after nucleosome assembly or prior to assembly (see text) for 30 min at room temperature. Assembly reactions were performed as described in Loyola et al. (21.Loyola A. LeRoy G. Wang Y.-H. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2837-2851PubMed Google Scholar) with 1 μg of plasmid DNA, 0.9 μg of histones, 0.15 μg of remodeling and spacing factor (RSF) (kindly provided by D. Reinberg, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, NJ), 75 μg of bovine serum albumin, 3 mm ATP, 30 mm phosphocreatine, 0.2 μg of phosphocreatine kinase, 5 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 16 h. The reaction mixtures were then partially digested with micrococcal nuclease (22.Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 5: 241-262Google Scholar), and the digestion patterns were analyzed by Southern blots, first probing with an oligonucleotide containing 2 copies of the 33-bp repeat (the FRA16B probe) and then reprobing with an oligonucleotide derived from nt 1572 to 1601 of pGEM3zf(+) (the vector probe). The reverse probing steps were also carried out, and the results showed no difference with the order of probing. To examine the ability of the 33-bp AT-rich FRA16B DNA repeat to assemble into nucleosomes, a 250-bp DNA fragment containing 6 copies of the FRA16B repeat was used in a nucleosome assembly reaction and analyzed by electron microscopy. Fig. 1 A shows a field with free DNA and DNAs bound by histone octamers with different translational positioning. The size of a nucleosome was determined as a histone octamer by comparing it to the size of nucleosomes in EM micrographs from a previous study (12.Wang Y.-H. Gellibolian R. Shimizu M. Wells R.D. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) in which micrococcal nuclease was used to confirm the formation of legitimate nucleosomes. Results from scoring protein-free DNA versus histone octamer-bound DNA are shown in Fig. 1 C. A pUC19 DNA fragment of 262 bp, representing a random DNA sequence, was also included as a control for nucleosome assembly. The (33bpFRA16B)6 DNA, treated under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures,” has 65% of the DNAs bound by histone octamer and a slightly better assembly ability compared with the pUC19 DNA, which shows 45% of the molecules associated with histone octamers. FRA16B is one of the distamycin-inducible fragile sites, and to observe this site FRA16B-expressing cultured cells usually have to be treated with 100 μm distamycin prior to the preparation and examination of the metaphase chromosomes. Therefore, the above nucleosome-assembled DNA samples were mixed with an equal volume of 100 μm distamycin at room temperature for 30 min and scored by EM visualization (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, for the (33bpFRA16B)6 DNA, only 21% of the total molecules are assembled into nucleosomes, which is about 3-fold lower compared with the same DNA without the distamycin treatment. In contrast, pUC19 DNA shows no significant differences upon the addition of distamycin. To quantitate the strength of a DNA for nucleosome assembly, a competitive nucleosome reconstitution assay was used (Refs. 12.Wang Y.-H. Gellibolian R. Shimizu M. Wells R.D. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13.Wang Y.-H. Griffith J.D. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 8863-8867Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, see “Experimental Procedures”). DNA fragments containing 2, 4, or 6 copies of the FRA16B DNA repeat (Fig. 2 A) ranging from 250 to 267 bp were constructed. The same pUC19 DNA fragment of 262 bp described above was also included as the baseline for nucleosome assembly. In addition, a DNA fragment containing 48 copies of a CCGNN repeat, which was previously shown to exclude nucleosomes, was compared (15.Wang Y.-H. Griffith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8863-8867Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The nucleosome-assembled DNAs appear as retarded bands when the DNA samples assembled with histone octamers (Fig. 2 B,lanes 1–5) are compared with the same set of DNAs assembled in the absence of histone octamers (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6–10). Because the aforementioned EM analysis shows that only histone octamers (not dimers or tetramers) are observed in nucleosome-assembled DNAs, the multiple retarded bands seen in the FRA16B DNA samples are probably caused by DNAs bound to histone octamers with different translational positionings. The results summarized in Table I (two left columns) present the ratio of the nucleosome-assembled DNA to free DNA for the pUC19, FRA16B, and (CCGNN)48 DNA fragments. The FRA16B DNA fragments were about 2∼2.8-fold more effective in nucleosome assembly compared with the pUC19 fragment, regardless of the number of 33-bp repeats. The (CCGNN)48fragment was 3-fold less effective relative to the pUC19 fragment, agreeing with the previous observations (15.Wang Y.-H. Griffith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8863-8867Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Table ICompetitive nucleosome reconstitution of FRA16B DNAsDistamycin additionDNANoneAfter assemblyPreincubatedComplex DNA/free DNAFree energyComplex DNA/free DNAFree energyComplex DNA/free DNAFree energycal/molcal/molcal/molpUC19100.68 ± 0.05229 ± 150.26 ± 0.01798 ± 23(33bpFRA16B)21.97 ± 0.15−400 ± 450.51 ± 0.09402 ± 1150.15 ± 0.011111 ± 46(33bpFRA16B)42.79 ± 0.51−600 ± 1150.32 ± 0.12702 ± 2510.14 ± 0.021181 ± 68(33bpFRA16B)62.32 ± 0.74−478 ± 1920.05 ± 0.021782 ± 2910.05 ± 0.011782 ± 120(CCGNN)480.31 ± 0.04673 ± 87NA1-aNA; not applicable.NANANA1-a NA; not applicable. Open table in a new tab Subsequently, the aforementioned nucleosome-assembled DNA samples were treated with an equal volume of 100 μm distamycin at room temperature for 30 min and analyzed on gels (Fig. 3 A). The results are shown in Table I (two middle columns). This analysis showed that the addition of distamycin had only a minor measurable influence (∼30% decrease) on nucleosome formation for the pUC19 fragment. In contrast, the addition of distamycin to the nucleosome-assembled FRA16B DNA had a dramatic effect on the energetics of nucleosome formation on these fragments, agreeing with the EM analysis. The 250-bp DNA containing 6 copies of the 33-bp FRA16B repeat is 46-fold less efficient in nucleosome assembly upon distamycin treatment, 14-fold less efficient than the pUC19 DNA with the same distamycin treatment, and 20-fold less than the pUC19 DNA without distamycin treatment. All three FRA16B DNA fragments show nucleosome exclusion in the presence of distamycin with an increasing ability to exclude nucleosomes in proportion to the number of 33-bp repeats (Fig. 3 B). Indeed, DNAs containing 2 and 4 copies of the 33-bp repeat show about 4- and 9-fold less efficient nucleosome formation, respectively, upon the addition of distamycin. These results suggest that the 33-bp repeat sequence is responsible for the nucleosome exclusion. The difference in free energy of assembly between the (33-bp)6-containing FRA16B DNA and the same fragment treated with distamycin is 2260 cal/mol. In the presence of distamycin, compared with the pUC19 DNA, the distamycin-treated (33bpFRA16B)6 DNA is 1553 cal/mol less favorable in assembling nucleosomes. These results demonstrate that the 33-bp FRA16B repeating sequence expels nucleosomes efficiently when distamycin is added to the assembled samples. We have shown that distamycin disrupts nucleosomes assembled with FRA16B DNAs. Next we examined whether binding of distamycin to FRA16B DNAs affects their ability to assemble nucleosomes. The FRA16B DNA fragments were first mixed with distamycin at the same concentration as above, at room temperature for 30 min, then assembled with nucleosomes by the stepwise salt dilution method (same as above), and then analyzed for assembly on gels. Again, the (33bpFRA16B)6 DNA showed strong nucleosome exclusion as efficient as for the addition of distamycin after assembly of nucleosomes and was about 46-fold less favorable in nucleosome formation than the same DNA in the absence of distamycin (Table I, two right columns). Therefore, we conclude that the 33-bp FRA16B repeat generates a strong nucleosome exclusion element in the presence of distamycin. Interestingly, for the pUC19 DNA, the (33bpFRA16B)2 DNA, and the (33bpFRA16B)4 DNA, the preincubation with distamycin gives these DNAs 2.3∼3.4-fold lower efficiency in nucleosome assembly relative to the addition of distamycin after assembly. We have demonstrated that distamycin abolishes the ability of FRA16B DNA to assemble a single nucleosome. Next we investigated the effect of distamycin on the assembly of multiple nucleosomes with a cloned human FRA16B sequence under physiological conditions. A 921-bp human FRA16B DNA was cloned into the pGEM3zf(+) vector, and it contains 14 copies of the 33-bp repeat and some imperfect repeats with AT-rich flanking sequences. This plasmid was used to assemble chromatin by RSF, which has been shown to assemble and space nucleosomes (21.Loyola A. LeRoy G. Wang Y.-H. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2837-2851PubMed Google Scholar, 23.LeRoy G. Loyola A. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14787-14790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The assembled plasmid was treated with distamycin or buffer, digested with micrococcal nuclease, and analyzed by Southern blots. Without distamycin, the FRA16B sequence (Fig. 4,lane 2) and the upstream vector sequence (Fig. 4, lane 5) can form regularly spaced nucleosome arrays as demonstrated by micrococcal nuclease digestion. However, with addition of distamycin the nucleosome array was lost from the FRA16B sequence (Fig. 4,lane 3), but spaced nucleosomes are still present in the vector region of the same plasmid (Fig. 4, lane 6). These results agree with what we observed in the assembly of single nucleosomes and argue that increasing the number of 33-bp repeats will increase the effect of distamycin in the destabilization of the nucleosome array. In this study we demonstrated that with addition of distamycin to the nucleosome-assembled FRA16B DNAs, or to these DNAs prior to nucleosome assembly, the FRA16B fragments strongly exclude nucleosomes compared with pUC19 DNA with the same treatment and expel nucleosomes up to 46-fold compared with the same fragment without distamycin. As the number of 33-bp repeats increases the ability to exclude nucleosomes also increases. These results suggest that both the 33-bp AT-rich repeating sequence and the presence of distamycin contribute to nucleosome exclusion by the FRA16B fragments, which would explain the basis for the generation of distamycin-inducible fragile sites. Although low copy numbers of 33-bp repeats, which are not within the range of repeats expressing the fragile site, were examined in this study, the phenomenon of nucleosome destabilization in the presence of distamycin could be amplified in FRA16B-expressing cells with the 33-bp repeat for as many as 2000 copies for the following reasons. First, the tendency to exclude nucleosomes is likely to increase in strength as the size of the repeat tract lengthens (Fig. 3). Second, the distamycin-dependent destabilization is not limited to single nucleosomes but also extends to nucleosome arrays (Fig. 4). Moreover, the lack of the formation of nucleosome arrays could affect the higher order organization of chromosome regions. In addition, distamycin has been shown to inhibit the binding of AT-rich DNA sequences to histone H1 and nuclear scaffolds (24.Kas E. Izaurralde E. Laemmli U.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which would result in further improper packaging or premature unwrapping of chromatin. We also realize that the free energy differences in nucleosome assembly were measured in vitro and are relatively low (Table I). However, in the cell and in the presence of histone H1 (see aforementioned reasons), these differences may be large enough to have strong biological effects. Indeed, the strong correlation between the unstable chromatin phenotype of the (CCGNN)48 sequence in yeast (16.Kirkpatrick D.T. Wang Y.-H. Dominska M. Griffith J.D. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7661-7671Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and the unfavorable energies of nucleosome formation of repeating CCGNN DNA (15.Wang Y.-H. Griffith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8863-8867Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) measured in vitro by the same assay used in this study further argues that the range of free energies measured in vitro can provide insight into chromatin stability in vivo. The mechanism of nucleosome exclusion has been proposed as the cause of folate-sensitive fragile sites in the study by Wang et al.(12.Wang Y.-H. Gellibolian R. Shimizu M. Wells R.D. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (also see Introduction). All of the folate-sensitive fragile sites sequenced to date contain expanded CGG repeats. Here, a different fragile DNA sequence, AT-rich and distamycin-inducible, is shown to strongly exclude nucleosomes in a distamycin-dependent manner, underlining the importance of nucleosome exclusion in the formation of fragile sites as a common mechanism for human chromosomal fragile sites in general.

Brown P.M. Fox K.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3385-3392Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 31.Churchill M.E. Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6043-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The interaction of distamycin and nucleosome-assembled DNA has been examined with various DNA sequences (31.Churchill M.E. Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6043-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 32.Brown P.M. Fox K.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 671-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 33.Low C.M. Drew H.R.

Using a synthetic DNA fragment containing 5 different (A/T)4 sites spaced 10 bases apart, Brown and Fox (32.Brown P.M. Fox K.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 671-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have elegantly demonstrated that distamycin can alter the rotational positioning of the nucleosome-assembled DNA by approximately 5 base pairs. These ligands bind to the minor groove of the AT base pairs, which faces inside toward the histone surface in the absence of ligands, but now the ligand binding causes these sites to face outward, possibly because of changes in bendability and/or electrostatic repulsion of ligand-bound AT base pairs. Similar findings have been recorded by Mann et al. (36.Mann D.B. Springer D.L. Smerdon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with two different types of DNA damage differentially affecting nucleosome assembly of the 5 S rRNA gene depending on the location of the adduct. These observations would provide an explanation for nucleosome exclusion by the AT-rich FRA16B DNA fragments upon the addition of distamycin. A random DNA sequence with occasional distamycin binding sites, such as the pUC19 fragment used in this study, upon binding of distamycin can freely rotate about 180o on the protein surface and results in none or, in this study, minor reduction (∼30%, Fig. 3 and Table I) in nucleosome formation. In contrast, the AT-rich FRA16B DNA fragments contain contiguous distamycin binding sites. Further, kinetic studies (37.Chen F.-M. Sha F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11143-11151Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) showed that the binding constant of distamycin ranges from 7 × 10−8 to 5 × 10−6mdepending on the AT sequence. Here, a final concentration of 50 μm distamycin was used, and this amount is sufficient to saturate all binding sites on the FRA16B DNAs. Therefore, with contiguous sites binding distamycin, these sequences might not be able to adopt a rotational positioning favorable for nucleosome assembly. This interpretation would also account for the increasing nucleosome exclusion ability as the number of FRA16B AT-rich repeats increases (Fig. 3 B). In summary, the results from this study provide strong support for a general model in which nucleosome exclusion creates unstable chromatin at these fragile sites and leads to the formation of gaps, DNA strand breakage, or poor staining in metaphase chromosomes.

Some of them, like L1 in the human, terminate at the 3′-end with a poly(dA) stretch whereas others, like the I factor in Drosophila melanogaster, have instead a short sequence repeated in tandem. This suggests different requirements for the initiation of reverse transcription.

Very little is known about the mechanism of retrotransposition of non-LTR 1The abbreviations used are: non-LTRnon-long terminal repeatORFopen reading frameUTRuntranslated regionRTreverse transcriptionTKthymidine kinaseChaCharolles reactive strain elements that are widespread among eukaryotic genomes. Most current knowledge comes from in vitro studies of the site-specific R2 elements from Bombyx mori. These studies indicate that reverse transcription of a full-length RNA intermediate of transposition occurs at the site of integration, using a 3′-hydroxyl group generated by endonucleolytic cleavage of the genomic DNA to prime synthesis of the first cDNA strand (1Luan D.D. Korman M.H. Jakubczak J.L. Eickbush T.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 595-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). This target-primed reverse transcription process is mediated by endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities encoded by the single open reading frame (ORF) of R2 elements (1Luan D.D. Korman M.H. Jakubczak J.L. Eickbush T.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 595-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 2Yang J. Eickbush T.H. Mol. Cell.

Many non-LTR retrotransposons, including L1 in the human and the I factor in Drosophila, differ from R2 in that they possess an additional ORF encoding a protein probably involved in ribonucleoparticle formation (4Dawson A. Hartswood E. Paterson T. Finnegan D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4448-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 5Hohjoh H. Singer M.F.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3088-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and maybe also in reverse transcription (7Martin S.L. Bushman F.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In addition, their endonucleases have similarities with apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases (8Martin F. Maranon C. Olivares M. Alonso C. Lopez M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 9Martin F. Olivares M. Lopez M.C. Alonso C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 283-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the endonuclease of R2 elements is related to bacterial restriction endonucleases (10Yang J. Malik H.S. Eickbush T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7847-7852Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, although direct experimental evidence is lacking, many observations are consistent with the idea that other non-LTR elements also use the target-primed reverse transcription mechanism of retrotransposition (1Luan D.D. Korman M.H. Jakubczak J.L. Eickbush T.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 595-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 11Ostertag E.M. Kazazian H.H., Jr. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 501-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The 3′-end of the RNA intermediate of transposition is crucial in this mechanism because it contains the site of initiation of reverse transcription. Studies of human L1 indicate that the poly(A) tail at the 3′-end of the transcript is used as the reverse transcription initiation site rather than specific sequences in the 3′-UTR of the element (12Moran J.V. DeBerardinis R.J. Kazazian H.H., Jr. Science. 1999; 283: 1530-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 13Moran J.V. Holmes S.E. Naas T.P. DeBerardinis R.J. Boeke J.D. Kazazian H.H., Jr. Cell. 1996; 87: 917-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). As a result, transposed copies of L1 terminate with a poly(dA) stretch at the 3′-end. Some non-LTR retrotransposons, such as the I factor in Drosophila melanogaster, do not terminate with a poly(dA) stretch but rather with a short sequence repeated in tandem, suggesting the use of an alternative mode of the initiation of reverse transcription. non-long terminal repeat open reading frame untranslated region reverse transcription thymidine kinase Charolles reactive strain The I factor is a non-LTR retrotransposon of particular interest because its transposition occurs at high frequencies in “Inducer-Reactive” hybrid dysgenic females (14Picard G. Bucheton A. Lavige J.M. Pelisson A. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1976; 282: 1813-1816Google Scholar) (for a recent review see Ref. 15Bucheton A. Busseau I. Teninges D. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A. Mobile DNA II. ASM Press, Washington D. C.2002: 796-812Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar), allowing in vivo analysis of the mechanism of retrotransposition. Transposition of I factors occurs at high frequencies in the germ line of hybrid females, called SF females, produced by crosses between females from reactive strains that lack functional I factors and males from inducer strains containing active I factors (14Picard G. Bucheton A. Lavige J.M. Pelisson A. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1976; 282: 1813-1816Google Scholar, 16Bucheton A. Paro R. Sang H.M. Pelisson A. Finnegan D.J. Cell. 1984; 38: 153-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Transposition is accompanied by a characteristic syndrome of sterility; some of the embryos produced by SF females die early in development. The degree of sterility (the proportion of the embryos that die) correlates with the frequency of transposition (17Picard G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 164: 235-247Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Active I factors possess all the typical features of non-LTR retrotransposons. They contain two ORFs. ORF1 encodes a nucleic acid-binding protein containing cysteine-rich motifs (4Dawson A. Hartswood E. Paterson T. Finnegan D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4448-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).

The transcription of I factors is initiated from an internal RNA polymerase II promoter lying within the 5′-UTR (21McLean C. Bucheton A. Finnegan D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It produces a full-length 5.4-kb transcript, the abundance of which correlates with the transposition frequency (22Chaboissier M.C. Busseau I. Prosser J. Finnegan D.J. Bucheton A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3557-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This 5.4-kb transcript is believed to serve both as a bicistronic messenger for the synthesis of the products of the two open reading frames and as the retrotransposition intermediate (22Chaboissier M.C. Busseau I. Prosser J. Finnegan D.J. Bucheton A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3557-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 23Bouhidel K. Terzian C. Pinon H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2370-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We have used a technique that relies on RNA circularization followed by RT-PCR to characterize in detail the structures of the 5′- and 3′-ends of full-length transcripts produced by actively transposing I factors. These transcripts follow the classical messenger RNA maturation pathway. The study of transcripts and transposed copies produced by elements modified at the 3′-ends indicate that the tandem TAA repeats at the 3′-end of the I factor are essential for efficient and precise retrotransposition. The pI954 construct has the I954 element inserted into the transformation vector pUChsneo (24Pritchard M.A. Dura J.M. Pelisson A. Bucheton A. Finnegan D.J. Mol Gen. Genet. 1988; 214: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To generate ITK and IΔ3TK, the 3′-end of I954 was amplified using primers 3′1 (5′-ACGGATCCGTCCATGGTACCAATC-3′) and 3′4 (5′-TAACCCGGGTTATTATTATTATTATGATAGATAGAATAG-3′) and primers 3′1 (5′-ACGGATCCGTCCATGGTACCAATC-3′) and 3′3 (5′-TAACCCGGGATGATAGATAGAATAGTTTACAAAAC-3′), respectively. These PCR products were cloned into the BamHI/XmaI-cut plasmid pBTK2 (a kind gift from Aude Le Roux) that contains the TK gene of the herpes simplex virus. Acc65I/EcoRI fragments from these constructs were used to replace the Acc65I/EcoRI fragment of pI954 containing the 3′-end of I. To generate IΔ3CC, the 3′-end of I954 was amplified with primers 3′TCC (5′-TTGAATTCGGATGATAGATAGAATAGTTTAC-3′) and Cl3 (5′-CTGCAGTCCATGGTACAATCTATTAAC-3′), digested with Acc65I/EcoRI, and used to replace the Acc65I/EcoRI fragment of pI954. P-mediated transformation of the wild type reactive strain Cha (Charolles) was performed as described (25Chaboissier M.C. Finnegan D. Bucheton A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2467-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Typically, 10–13 Cha females were mated to 8–10 transgenic males on fresh medium and transferred on new medium the next day. Eggs were left to develop for 24 h at 25 °C, and the percentage of hatched eggs was determined. Only samples of more than 100 embryos were taken into account. Mean values were calculated from at last three independent crosses for each transgenic line. 20 units of recombinant RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega) were added to all reactions involving RNA. Total RNA was extracted from 50 pairs of ovaries with the RNeasy® Midi kit (Qiagen). 50 μg of RNA were treated with 20 units of RNase-free DNase I (Promega) in 100 μl for 1 h at 37 °C. After phenol/chloroform extractions, the RNAs were ethanol precipitated with 2.5 m ammonium acetate and resuspended in 20 μl of H2O. For intramolecular ligation, 20 μg of RNA were incubated with 2.5 units of tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (Epicentre Technologies) in 20 μl for 1 h at 37 °C. After ethanol precipitation in 2.5 mammonium acetate, 5 μg of RNAs were incubated with 20 units of T4 RNA ligase (Epicentre Technologies) in 400 μl of optimal buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP, and 100 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin) for 16 h at 16 °C. After phenol/chloroform extraction, the ligated RNA was ethanol precipitated in 2.5 m ammonium acetate. 400 ng of RNAs were reverse transcribed using the ThermoScript™ RT-PCR System (Invitrogen) and 10 pmol of primer 2cir5′ (5′-CATCCCTCAACTTCTCCTCC-3′) for 1 h at 59 °C. The sample was then treated for 20 min at 37 °C with 2 units of RNase H. Nested PCR amplifications were performed on 2 μl of the RT-PCR reaction, first with primers B290 (5′-TCGAAAGAGTTGTTGTC-3′) and Ri160 (5′-GTACATAACAAGCCAGCAATTAG-3′) and second with primers B95 (5′-GATTTTGCTGATAAGAG-3′) and 2cir3′up (5′-CCCCGTAGCTAATGCTATACTATC-3′). The PCR products were cloned using the TOPO TA Cloning® Kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced by Genome Express. The positions of the oligonucleotides at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the I954 element are shown in Fig. 1a. 5 μg of RNA were reverse transcribed with 20 pmol of anchor-oligo(dT) primer Ad1dT (5′-GCGAGCTCCGCGGCCGCGTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′) for 1 h at 52 °C using the ThermoScript™ RT-PCR System (Invitrogen). Two sequential PCR amplifications were performed, first with Cl3 and Ad1 (5′-GCGAGCTCCGCGGCCGCG-3′) and second with sev3′up (5′-CTTTAAACCACATATTTAACTCATG-3′) and Ad1 (Fig. 1a). The PCR products were electroeluted from a 5% polyacrylamide gel, cloned, and sequenced as above. Genomic DNA was extracted from pools of 25 males using standard procedures. Inverse PCR experiments were performed as described by Chaboissier et al. (25Chaboissier M.C. Finnegan D. Bucheton A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2467-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), except that the restriction enzyme MboI was used for digestion, and oligonucleotides 7 (5′-TCGCAAGGTCGGCTTTAAGG-3′) and 3 (5′-ACCCTCTAGACCTTCTTAGC-3′) were used in PCR amplifications. PCR products were cloned using the Stratagene PCR-Script™ Amp cloning kit and sequenced by Genome Express. RNA detection by in situ hybridization on whole mount ovaries was performed following the protocol of Tautz and Pfeifle (26Tautz D. Pfeifle C. Chromosoma (Berlin). 1989; 98: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar) adapted by Capri et al. (27Capri M. Santoni M.J. Thomas-Delaage M. Ait-Ahmed O. Mech. Dev. 1997; 68: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The probe was a PCR fragment between nucleotides 1637 and 2844 on the sequence of the I factor (GenBankTM accession number M14954) labeled with digoxigenin using the Nick translation kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Protein detection by immunofluorescence on whole mount ovaries was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the C-terminal nine amino acids of the ORF1 protein of the I factor as described by Seleme et al. (28Seleme M. Busseau I. Malinsky S. Bucheton A. Teninges D. Genetics. 1999; 151: 761-771PubMed Google Scholar). We used the RNA circularization/RT-PCR technique (29Mandl C.W. Heinz F.X.

A. 1997; 94: 5628-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) to analyze the transcripts produced by a fully active I factor. The I954 element (24Pritchard M.A. Dura J.M. Pelisson A. Bucheton A. Finnegan D.J. Mol Gen. Genet. 1988; 214: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) is an active I factor that was isolated from the wIR3 mutation (16Bucheton A. Paro R. Sang H.M. Pelisson A. Finnegan D.J. Cell. 1984; 38: 153-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We introduced it into the Cha reactive strain. Because I factors transpose exclusively in the female germ line, transgenic lines were maintained by crossing transgenic males with virgin Cha females at each generation, thus ensuring that they contain a single copy of the I954 element. Total RNA was extracted from the dissected ovaries of females produced by crosses between transgenic males and Cha females, treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to remove any CAP structure that would prevent ligation of the 5′-ends, and circularized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Reverse transcription was primed using the oligonucleotide 2cir5′ (Fig. 1a), and two nested PCR reactions were performed, first using primers B290 and Ri160 and second using primers B95 and 2cir3′up (Fig. 1a). The products were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel (Fig. 1b). One major smeared band was obtained with RNA extracted from the ovaries of females issued from transgenic males along with some additional minor products of various sizes. None of these PCR products were obtained with RNA extracted from ovaries of Cha females, demonstrating that our conditions allow the specific detection of transcripts produced by the active I954 element. No amplification product was obtained when the tobacco acid pyrophosphatase step before RNA circularization was omitted (not shown), indicating that the transcripts produced by the I954 element are capped at the 5′-end like conventional mRNAs. To obtain information about the structure at the ends of the transcripts produced by the I954 element, we cloned and sequenced the major PCR products. The organization of the sequences of the RNA species are shown in Fig. 2. All start at the second nucleotide of I (Fig. 2a) and terminate with a poly(A) tail varying from 18 to 33 A residues (Fig. 2b). Two polyadenylation sites were used, which lie within the genomic DNA that is adjacent to the 3′-end of the element. We searched for consensus polyadenylation signals (AAUAAA) and G/U-rich sequences (32Graber J.H. Cantor C.R. Mohr S.C. Smith T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14055-14060Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 33Chen F. MacDonald C.C. Wilusz J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2614-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) in this region. There is no conventional AAUAAA sequence up to more than 50 nucleotides upstream of the two polyadenylation sites that were used. Possibly, the tandem UAA repeats could serve as a polyadenylation signal, and downstream G/U-rich sequences are present in the adjacent sequence (Fig. 2b). The 3′-ends of transcripts produced by the I954 element were also analyzed by conventional RT-PCR; reverse transcription was primed with an anchor oligo(dT) primer and followed by two sequential PCR amplifications using primers designed to amplify sequences between the 3′-end of I and the poly(A) stretch (see “Experimental Procedures”). The PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The results were similar to those obtained using the circularized RNAs; the five transcripts identified in this way are polyadenylated in the 3′-flanking sequences at one of the two positions determined previously by the RNA circularization/RT-PCR method (Fig. 2b). We designed I elements derived from I954 by addition of strong polyadenylation signals and/or removal of the tandem TAA repeats at the 3′-end (Fig. 2c). The ITK element is identical to I954 except in the 3′-flanking sequences, because the last TAA repeat is followed by a sequence containing the polyadenylation signals of the gene encoding the TK of the herpes simplex virus. The IΔ3TK element is identical to ITK except that the TAA repeats are deleted, leaving only one T residue. Finally, the IΔ3CC element derives from I954 by a deletion of the TAA repeats, leaving only one T plus two additional C residues that are fused to the EcoRI site of pUChsneo. Transgenic lines for these constructs were established and maintained in the same way as for I954. Total RNA was extracted from the dissected ovaries of females produced by crosses between transgenic males and Cha females. The 3′-ends of transcripts produced by the ITK, IΔ3TK, and IΔ3CC elements were analyzed by RT-PCR as described above for I954. The RT-PCR products were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel (Fig. 3). Several bands of low molecular weight (indicated by an asterisk in Fig. 3) were produced in all cases, including with RNA from the Cha reactive strain. These bands correspond to transcripts produced by the defective heterochromatic I elements that are present in all strains (15Bucheton A. Busseau I. Teninges D. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3557-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Specific amplification products (indicated as A, B, and C in Fig. 3) were obtained after a RT-PCR of RNA from the ovaries of females issued from males transgenic for ITK, IΔ3TK, and IΔ3CC. These products were cloned and sequenced, and the data are shown in Fig. 2c. The ITK, IΔ3TK, and IΔ3CC elements produce transcripts of different classes according to the sites of polyadenylation. These different classes can be assigned to the different RT-PCR products observed on the gel (Fig. 3). Polyadenylation of transcripts produced by the ITK element occurs either within the flanking TK sequences or near the 3′-end of I (Fig. 2c), giving rise to the RT-PCR products designated A and B (in Fig. 3), respectively. Therefore, the presence of strong polyadenylation signals in the flanking sequences seem to efficiently determine the polyadenylation of a fraction of the transcripts. The IΔ3TK element produces the same classes of transcripts and, in addition, transcripts that are prematurely polyadenylated within the I element (Fig. 2c) corresponding to the RT-PCR products of slightly lower molecular weights (designated C, in Fig. 3). The IΔ3CC element produces transcripts that are polyadenylated in the 3′-flanking sequences and also transcripts that are prematurely polyadenylated within the I element (Fig. 2c), and give rise to the RT-PCR products designated B and C (in Fig. 3), respectively. We estimated the activity of the different I elements by determining their ability to induce female sterility. Females issued from crosses between Cha females and males transgenic for I954 or ITK were severely sterile. They produced no hatched progeny during the first 2 weeks of their adult lives and then became more and more fertile as they aged. These features are characteristics of the syndrome of sterility that is associated with high levels of retrotransposition of I factors (17Picard G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 164: 235-247Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This indicates that I954 and ITK are very active I factors that retrotranspose with high efficiency in the female germ line. In contrast, females issued from crosses between Cha females and males transgenic for IΔ3TK or IΔ3CC, deleted for the tandem TAA repeats, were normally fertile. Hatching percentages of the eggs were found to be 84 ± 9, 82 ± 10, and 86 ± 12 for three independent IΔ3TK transgenic lines and 86 ± 4, 81 ± 6, and 85 ± 8 for three independent IΔ3CC transgenic lines. This indicates that the IΔ3TK and IΔ3CC elements retrotranspose less than I954 and ITK. We verified that some retrotransposed copies of IΔ3TK and IΔ3CC could be detected by in situ hybridization experiments on salivary gland polytene chromosomes of larvae (data not shown). The transcripts and protein product of ORF1 synthesized by functional I elements co-localize in the female germ line and concentrate in the oocyte (15Bucheton A. Busseau I. Teninges D. Craig N.L.

The transcripts and ORF1 products of the I954 (Fig. 4, b and g) and ITK (Fig. 4, c and h) elements that retrotranspose with high efficiency show the expected pattern of expression. The same picture is also observed with the transcripts and ORF1 products of the IΔ3TK (Fig. 4, d and i) and IΔ3CC (Fig. 4,e and j) elements. This indicates that the transcripts produced by IΔ3TK and IΔ3CC are transported normally and translated. Therefore, IΔ3TK and IΔ3CC seem to be capable of building the components of the retrotransposition machinery. We recovered, by inverse PCR, transposed copies of the ITK, IΔ3TK, and IΔ3CC elements and determined the sequences at their 3′-ends (Fig. 2c). Transposed copies of ITK terminate with variable numbers of tandem TAA repeats. They do not contain sequences from the DNA flanking the progenitor element, indicating that reverse transcription starts within the UAA repeats of the RNA retrotransposition intermediate. Most transposed copies of IΔ3TK and IΔ3CC terminate a few nucleotides upstream or downstream of the 3′-end of the progenitor element. One of the copies produced by IΔ3TK ends within the 3′-UTR of I 104 base pairs upstream of the 3′-end and may have been generated by the reverse transcription of an RNA prematurely polyadenylated. Therefore, the tandem UAA repeats in the 3′-end of the retrotransposition intermediate of the I factor are necessary for the precision of the initiation of reverse transcription. Previous data (22Chaboissier M.C. Busseau I. Prosser J. Finnegan D.J. Bucheton A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3557-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Chaboissier M.C. Finnegan D. Bucheton A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2467-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) suggested that a fraction of the transcripts produced by I factors may not be polyadenylated. The data (34De La Roche Saint Andre C. Bregliano J.C. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1875-1884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained with studies of RNA extracted from whole flies, which might include some transcripts produced by I factors in somatic tissues and not correlated with retrotransposition. To focus our analysis on transcripts associated with I factor retrotransposition, we performed experiments on RNA extracted from dissected ovaries. We found that these transcripts undergo the classical maturation steps of messenger RNAs at the 5′- and 3′-ends; they are capped and polyadenylated. Transcription of the I factor is supposed to initiate at the first nucleotide. This expectation is supported by S1 mapping (22Chaboissier M.C. Busseau I. Prosser J. Finnegan D.J. Bucheton A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3557-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and primer extension (21McLean C. Bucheton A. Finnegan D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) experiments, which mapped the transcription start site at the 5′-end of the I factor. However the resolution of these experiments did not allow us to determine precisely the exact first nucleotide of the transcript. All the RNA circularization/RT-PCR products that we have analyzed seem to derive from transcripts starting at the second nucleotide of the I954 element. This is puzzling because I954 produces complete retrotransposed copies, starting at the first deoxycytidine (24Pritchard M.A. Dura J.M. Pelisson A. Bucheton A. Finnegan D.J. Mol Gen. Genet. 1988; 214: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Chaboissier M.C. Finnegan D. Bucheton A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2467-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The first ribocytidine at the 5′-end of the transcripts might have been removed during the RNA circularization/RT-PCR procedure. Variable transcription start sites have been reported by other authors (35Kuhn J. Binder S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 36Sugahara Y. Carninci P. Itoh M. Shibata K. Konno H. Endo T. Muramatsu M. Hayashizaki Y. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 263: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) who used the RNA-circularization/RT-PCR or related techniques and can also be explained by removal of some nucleotides at the 5′-end of the transcripts during the procedures. Alternatively, it is not inconceivable that the transcription start site of the I factor is at the second nucleotide of the element and that an untemplated deoxycytidine would be added during reverse transcription or integration of the new copy by an unknown mechanism. We analyzed the polyadenylated transcripts of I elements with various flanking sequences at the 3′-end. Our results show that the polyadenylation sites are determined to some extent by cryptic consensus polyadenylation signals present in the flanking sequences. In some cases, the tandem UAA repeats transcribed from the I factor 3′-end appear to be used instead of the consensus AAUAAA polyadenylation signal. There is a AATAAA sequence within the 3′-UTR of the I factor 73 nucleotides upstream from the tandem TAA repeats (19Fawcett D.H. Lister C.K. Kellett E. Finnegan D.J. Cell. 1986; 47: 1007-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Noticeably, we found transcripts in which the polyadenylation site seems to be determined by this consensus signal in the case of the IΔ3TK and IΔ3CC elements that lack the tandem TAA repeats at the 3′-ends but not in the case of the I954 and ITK elements that have intact 3′-ends. This suggests that the tandem UAA repeats represent a stronger polyadenylation signal than the upstream AAUAAA consensus sequence. The latter is probably a very weak signal anyway because in the absence of tandem UAA repeats a substantial fraction of the transcripts undergo polyadenylation downstream of the 3′-end of the I element. The tandem TAA repeats at the 3′-end of the I factor are required for efficient and precise retrotransposition. The contrast between the ITK and the IΔ3TK elements that have identical 3′-flanking sequences and differ only by the presence or absence of tandem TAA repeats is particularly striking. Our results suggest that tandem UAA repeats in the transcript are important for its efficient utilization as a retrotransposition intermediate. The pattern of expression in the ovaries of transcripts that are devoid of tandem UAA repeats is not affected, and these transcripts are translated (Fig. 4). However, a moderate lowering in amounts would not have been detected by these experiments. Given that the tandem UAA repeats may be used as polyadenylation signals, it is possible that their deletion causes a drop in polyadenylation. The analysis of the rare transposed copies of IΔ3TK and IΔ3CC has been informative. Most of the copies terminate a few nucleotides upstream or downstream of the actual 3′-end of the progenitor element. One of these copies, resulting from retrotransposition of IΔ3TK, is truncated at the 3′-end at a position suggesting that it might result from the reverse transcription of an RNA polyadenylated within the 3′-UTR of the I element. In contrast, transposed copies generated by I elements ending with tandem TAA repeats always terminate precisely at the 3′-end of I with various numbers of tandem TAA repeats, as is usual for transposed copies of active I factors (24Pritchard M.A. Dura J.M. Pelisson A. Bucheton A. Finnegan D.J. Mol Gen. Genet. 1988; 214: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Chaboissier M.C. Finnegan D. Bucheton A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2467-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 37Busseau I. Malinsky S. Balakireva M. Chaboissier M.C. Teninges D. Bucheton A. Genetics. 1998; 148: 267-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that the tandem UAA repeats in the 3′-ends of the transcripts are required for the precise initiation of reverse transcription. This suggests that the reverse transcriptase of the I factor associates with the RNA transposition intermediate and recognizes the UAA repeats to initiate reverse transcription. In the absence of these repeats the reverse transcriptase would initiate inefficiently in a region of the RNA near the normal position of these repeats. These findings contrast with what is known about the initiation of reverse transcription in the case of human L1 elements (see below). The initiation of reverse transcription at the UAA repeats of the transcript implies that the sequences that are downstream of these repeats, including the poly(A) tail, are probably degraded during or after completion of the target-primed reverse transcription process. However, it cannot be excluded that these sequences are processed from the retrotransposition intermediate prior to reverse transcription either in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. Noticeably, non-polyadenylated transcripts were identified in earlier studies (22Chaboissier M.C. Busseau I. Prosser J. Finnegan D.J. Bucheton A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3557-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,25Chaboissier M.C. Finnegan D. Bucheton A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2467-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is noticeable that none of the transposed copies of the various I elements that we have studied in this paper contains a poly(dA) sequence at the 3′-end, indicating that the poly(A) tails of the transcripts cannot be used instead of the tandem UAA repeats for the initiation of reverse transcription. This contrasts with mammalian L1 elements for which reverse transcription is initiated in the poly(A) tails at the 3′-ends of the transcripts (12Moran J.V. DeBerardinis R.J. Kazazian H.H., Jr. Science. 1999; 283: 1530-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar,13Moran J.V. Holmes S.E. Naas T.P. DeBerardinis R.J. Boeke J.D. Kazazian H.H., Jr. Cell. 1996; 87: 917-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). The reverse transcription of L1 elements initiating in the poly(A) tail of read-through transcripts results in the insertion into new sites of sequences adjacent to the progenitor element along with the L1 sequences. Sequences resulting from this type of DNA transduction occur in the human and mouse genomes (38Pickeral O.K. Makalowski W. Boguski M.S. Boeke J.D. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 39Goodier J.L. Ostertag E.M. Kazazian H.H., Jr. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Therefore L1 elements are believed to represent a major source of shaping and evolution of mammalian genomes (40Kazazian H.H., Jr. Science. 2000; 289: 1152-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 41Eickbush T. Science. 1999; 283: 1465-1467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Boeke J.D. Pickeral O.K. Nature. 1999; 398: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast, the reverse transcriptase of I factors initiates reverse transcription in the UAA repeats at the end of I element sequences. Consequently, the flanking sequences present in the transcripts are not inserted in the genome. Therefore, I elements are not expected to have the same influence as L1 elements in remodeling the genome. In addition, the weak specificity of the L1 retrotransposition machinery for L1 transcripts is thought to be responsible for the mobilization of short interspersed nucleotidic elements and the generation of processed pseudogenes (43Esnault C. Maestre J. Heidmann T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), which are important components of mammalian genomes. The retrotransposition machinery of the I factor seems to recognize strongly its own transcripts. It is therefore very unlikely that it is used for the reverse transcription of messenger RNAs or other transcripts. Strikingly, the Drosophila genome is devoid of short interspersed nucleotidic elements, and only very rare retropseudogenes have been identified in this organism (44Jeffs P. Ashburner M. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1991; 244: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 45Akhmanova A. Hennig W. Genome. 1998; 41: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Therefore these variations in the retrotransposition mechanisms of non-LTR retrotransposons in mammals and Drosophila might account for major differences in the organization of the genomes of these species. The absence of short interspersed nucleotidic elements and processed pseudogenes in Drosophila might be due to the fact the I elements and other Drosophila retrotransposons are clean transposable elements.

By generating transgenic mice, we have previously shown that the activity of the mouse pro-α1(I) promoter was controlled by separate cell-specific <i>cis</i>-acting elements. In particular, a sequence located between −3.2 and −2.3 kb was needed to induce expression of the reporter gene at high levels in tendon fibroblasts. In the present work, by using the same transgenic approach, we have identified two short elements in this sequence, named tendon-specific element (TSE) 1 and TSE2, that were necessary to direct reporter gene expression selectively in tendon fibroblasts. Gel shift assays showed that TSE1 and TSE2 bound proteins specifically present in nuclear extracts from tendon fibroblasts and that the sequence of TSE2 binding a tendon-specific protein corresponded to an E-box. Analysis of transgenic mice further indicated that TSE1 and TSE2 needed to cooperate not only with each other but also with other <i>cis</i>-acting elements of the proximal promoter to activate reporter gene expression in tendon fibroblasts. Similarly, it pointed out that the so-called osteoblast-specific element had to interact with downstream sequences to drive reporter gene expression in osteoblasts of transgenic mice. Thus, expression of the mouse pro-α1(I) collagen gene in tendon fibroblasts appears to be the result of a unique combination of different <i>cis</i>-acting elements, including TSE1 and TSE2."

These enzymes can also catalyze conversion of other aldehydes to the corresponding acids and are considered broad specificity enzymes. It is thus possible that all class I ALDHs may have a similar range of substrates but may not be redundant because of different patterns of tissue expression. On the other hand, some degree of specificity for natural aldehyde substrates may exist within this family, allowing each enzyme to play a defined physiological role. In particular, the degree and the molecular mechanisms of specificity for all-trans-retinal and its isomers within the class I enzymes are not well characterized. RALDH (ALDH1A1**) was initially purified and cloned from rat kidney (18Labrecque J. Bhat P.V. Lacroix A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Bhat P.V. Labrecque J. Boutin J.-M. Lacroix A. Yoshida A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), based on its capacity to catalyze the oxidation of all-trans- and 9-cis-retinal, but not 13-cis-retinal, to the corresponding acids with high efficiency (20Labrecque J. Dumas F. Lacroix A. Bhat P.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 681-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have also shown that RALDH is highly expressed and developmentally regulated in the kidney (21Bhat P.V. Marcinkiewicz M., Li, Y. Mader S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and in other tissues such as trachea, intestine, and stomach epithelia (22Bhat P.V. Bader T. Nettesheim P. Jetten A.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 23Bhat P.V. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), where its expression is regulated by vitamin A status. On the other hand, PB-ALDH (ALDH1A7**) is expressed mainly in rat liver after induction by phenobarbital (24Lindahl R. Evces S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11991-11996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like all members of the class I ALDH family, the two ALDHs share a high degree of amino acid identity (89.6%). However, results from our laboratory and others (25Bhat P.V. Chow Lan N. Guimond J. Mader S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: A4870Google Scholar, 26Hsu L.C. Chang W.-C. Hoffmann I. Duester G. Biochem. J. 1999; 338 (385): 387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kathmann E.C. Naylor S. Lipsky J.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 38: 1170-1176Google Scholar) indicate that PB-ALDH and RALDH have different substrate specificities because PB-ALDH does not catalyze all-trans-retinal conversion. Furthermore, we show that PB-ALDH is also poorly active with 9-cis-retinal. We have used point mutants and chimeric enzymes to characterize amino acids important for activity with retinal isomers. We find that amino acids of RALDH that are necessary and sufficient for catalysis of all-trans-retinal differ from those that are required for catalysis of 9-cis-retinal. The molecular basis underlying the differential specificity of RALDH and PB-ALDH for retinal substrates is discussed. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs and Promega. Retinoids were obtained from Sigma. The PB-ALDH cDNA and the polyclonal antibodies raised against PB-ALDH were generous gifts from Dr. Ronald Lindahl (University of South Dakota) and Dr. James J. Lipsky (Mayo Clinic/Foundation, Rochester, MN). cDNAs coding for the open reading frame of RALDH and PB-ALDH were cloned into the NdeI and Hin dIII sites of the bacterial expression plasmid pT7-7 by PCR amplification. Primers corresponding to the N terminus and the C terminus of RALDH were designed according to the published cDNA sequences (19Bhat P.V. Labrecque J. Boutin J.-M. Lacroix A. Yoshida A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The N-terminal primer contains a NdeI site, an initiation ATG codon, and nucleotides 1–21 of the RALDH open reading frame. The C-terminal primer contains a Hin dIII site and the reverse complement of nucleotides 1479–1506 of RALDH including the termination codon TAA. Because the nucleotide sequences of PB-ALDH N terminus and C terminus are identical to those of RALDH (28Dunn T.J. Koleske A.J. Lindahl R. Pitot H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13057-13065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the same primers were used for PCR amplification of PB-ALDH cDNA. Correct insertion of the RALDH and PB-ALDH cDNAs in pT7-7 was verified by DNA sequencing. Mutations at position 301 were introduced by two rounds of PCR amplification using primers hybridizing with nucleotides 892–916 of RALDH or PB-ALDH but containing mutations converting Cys301into Ile or Ile301 into Cys, respectively, and the N-terminal and C-terminal primers. The corresponding cDNAs were digested with NdeI and Hin dIII and cloned into the corresponding sites of pT7-7, yielding expression vectors for RALDH301I and PB-ALDH301C. The presence of the mutations was confirmed by sequencing. Two clones corresponding to independent PCR amplification reactions were characterized for each mutant with similar results. Chimeras RALDH-131, PB-131, RALDH-343, and PB-343 were constructed by exchange of cDNA fragments between the RALDH and PB-ALDH cDNAs using ScaI or ApaI sites (nucleotides 392–397 and 1026–1031, respectively) and the NdeI and Hin dIII cloning sites. Note that fragments of PB-ALDH flanked by ApaI sites were produced by PCR amplification, whereas the endogenous ApaI site in RALDH was used. Chimeras RALDH-131 and RALDH-343 contain the RALDH cDNA to the ScaI or ApaI site, respectively, followed by the complementary sequences of the PB-ALDH cDNA. Conversely, chimeras PB-131 and PB-343 contain the PB-ALDH cDNA to the ScaI or ApaI site, respectively, ligated to the complementary fragments of the RALDH cDNA. Parental and recombinant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coliBL21-DE3 cells, which express the T7 polymerase under the control of a lac promoter. Expression was induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside in exponentially growing bacteria and continued for 3 h. Bacterial pellets were sonicated in 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Tween 20, and protein extracts were collected after elimination of debris by centrifugation. Expression of RALDH and PB-ALDH was monitored by Western blot using rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against PB-ALDH that cross-react with RALDH as described previously (22Bhat P.V. Bader T. Nettesheim P. Jetten A.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 23Bhat P.V. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). At least two clones originating from independent PCR reactions and coding for RALDH, PB-ALDH, or mutants thereof were expressed in bacteria and characterized in enzyme assays. Similar results were obtained in all cases using duplicate constructs, indicating that activity of the recombinant enzymes was not affected by potential mutations introduced during PCR amplification. Enzymatic activity was assayed in a final volume of 250 μl containing 0.02% Tween 80, 1.61 mm dithiothreitol, 603 μm NAD, and crude protein extracts containing RALDH, PB-ALDH, or mutant enzymes. In all experiments, extracts were standardized for enzyme expression levels, as assessed by Western blotting, and for total protein concentration. Varying concentrations of substrate (all-trans, 9-cis, or propanal) were added in 2.5 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide. After incubation with retinal at 25 °C for 60 min, the reaction was terminated by cooling at 4 °C in ice-cold water. Retinoic acid was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (29Bhat P.V. Poissant L. Lacroix A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 967: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All-trans-retinoic acid production was undetectable using proteins extracts from bacteria carrying the parental pT7-7 plasmid. Low levels of 9-cis-retinoic acid production were observed with extracts from bacteria carrying the parental pT7-7 plasmid and subtracted from the values obtained with extracts expressing RALDH or PB-ALDH. Controls performed without protein extract or without substrate indicated that retinoic acid production and NADH formation required both enzyme and substrate. When propanal was the substrate, enzyme activity was quantified by measuring the NADH formed 10 min after initiating the reaction by absorption at 340 nm (Beckman DU-40 spectrophotometer). Kinetic data for all substrates were obtained by performing saturation curves under conditions in which enzyme activity was linear with respect to protein concentration and reaction time, and by fitting the data from the saturation curves to Michaelis-Menten and Lineweaver-Burk plots with the software program Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). To investigate the mechanisms of specificity for retinal substrates within class I ALDHs, we expressed two members of this family, rat RALDH and PB-ALDH, in E. coli with the aim of comparing their enzymatic properties with retinal isomers. To ascertain that expression levels of the two enzymes were similar, immunoblots were performed with crude extracts from BL21-DE3 bacteria transformed with expression vectors for RALDH (Fig. 1 A, lane 1) or PB-ALDH (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) or with the parental pT7-7 expression vector (data not shown), using an antibody raised against PB-ALDH. No bands were detected in extracts from control bacteria transformed with pT7-7 (data not shown), whereas a single band with a molecular mass of 55 kDa could be detected in both RALDH- and PB-ALDH-expressing extracts (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 2). The molecular mass of the expressed enzymes is identical to the one reported for both purified enzymes (18Labrecque J. Bhat P.V. Lacroix A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Lindahl R. Evces S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11991-11996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the antibody recognized both enzymes equally well because the relative intensities of the bands were comparable after [35S]methionine incorporation. Purified RALDH was previously shown to catalyze the conversion of all-trans- and 9-cis-retinal, but not 13-cis-retinal, to their respective retinoic acids (20Labrecque J. Dumas F. Lacroix A. Bhat P.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 681-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine whether recombinant RALDH retained these enzymatic properties. Increasing concentrations of bacterial extracts containing similar levels of recombinant RALDH or PB-ALDH were assayed with all-trans- or 9-cis-retinal at 25 °C. All-trans-retinoic acid production increased with RALDH concentration, but no significant levels of retinoic acid production were detected with PB-ALDH (Fig. 1 B). In addition, RALDH also catalyzed oxidation of 9-cis-retinal (Fig. 1 C). On the other hand, high amounts of PB-ALDH were necessary to observe production of low levels of 9-cis-retinoic acid, suggesting that this enzyme possesses low activity for 9-cis- but not all-trans- retinal. To test whether the kinetic properties of the recombinant RALDH for retinal substrates are similar to those of the purified enzyme from rat kidney, we assessed the saturation kinetics of RALDH with all-trans- and 9-cis-retinal (Fig. 4; Table I). The Km values obtained (8.7 and 10 μm for 9-cis- and all-trans- retinal) are in good agreement with the Km values observed with the purified enzyme under the same experimental conditions (5.7 and 9.8 μm for 9-cis and all-trans-retinal; see also Ref. 20Labrecque J. Dumas F. Lacroix A. Bhat P.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 681-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, a higher catalytic efficiency was obtained with 9-cis- versus all-trans-retinal (2.3-fold ratio), whereas 13-cis conversion was not observed (data not shown). Similar observations were also made with the purified enzyme (20Labrecque J. Dumas F. Lacroix A. Bhat P.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 681-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), supporting the conclusion that the recombinant RALDH is fully active.Table IKinetic constants for RALDH and chimeric enzymes active with retinal substratesKmVmaxVmax/KmAll-trans9-cisAll-trans9-cisAll-trans9-cisμmnmol/min/mgRALDH108.73.26.30.320.72RALDH-3434.93.92.42.80.480.72RALDH-1313.0ND1-aND, not determined.1.5ND0.49NDPB-131ND29ND8.5ND0.29Kinetic parameters were calculated using Prism software from saturation experiments performed twice in triplicate as described in Figs. 4 and5.

Open table in a new tab Kinetic parameters were calculated using Prism software from saturation experiments performed twice in triplicate as described in Figs. 4 and5. Variation between experiments was less than 10% for all Km and Vmax values except for the Vmax values of RALDH and RALDH-343 for all-trans- retinal, which were ±20%. Units of velocity are expressed per mg of crude protein extracts standardized for enzyme expression levels. To verify that recombinant PB-ALDH is active, we examined its capacity to oxidize propanal, a property described previously for PB-ALDH (24Lindahl R. Evces S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11991-11996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that NADH production was augmented with increasing amounts of whole cell extract expressing either RALDH or PB-ALDH when propanal was used as a substrate (Fig. 1 D). The Km of PB-ALDH for propanal (1.2 mm; data not shown) compared well with the reported Km (1.4 mm) of the purified enzyme from rat liver (24Lindahl R. Evces S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11991-11996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the lack of activity of PB-ALDH with all-trans-retinal is not due to reduced activity of the bacterially expressed enzyme. Together, these results demonstrate a striking difference in substrate selectivity between these two class I enzymes, despite their high degree of homology, and indicate that amino acids that differ between RALDH and PB-ALDH are responsible for their differential activity with retinal substrates. Among the 52 amino acids that differ between RALDH and PB-ALDH (Fig. 2), the replacement of Cys301with Ile in PB-ALDH is the most striking substitution. This amino acid is conserved in class I and class II aldehyde dehydrogenases (30Perozich J. Nicholas H. Wang B.-C. Lindahl R. Hempel J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and is located at the end of the substrate entrance tunnel next to Cys302 (31Liu Z.-J. Sun Y.-J. Rose J. Chung Y.-J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6003-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which plays an important role in the catalytic site of aldehyde dehydrogenases. A different orientation of the Cys301 side chain was observed in ALDH1 and ALDH2 and may contribute to the differential activity of class I and class II enzymes with retinal by modulating the accessibility of Cys302 (33Moore S.A. Baker H.M. Blythe T.J. Kitson K.E. Kitson T.M. Baker E.N. Structure. 1998; 6: 1541-1551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To test whether Ile at position 301 affects the catalysis of retinal, we replaced Ile301 with Cys in PB-ALDH and expressed the mutant protein in E. coli. Expression levels of wild-type (PB-ALDH) and mutant PB-ALDH (PB-ALDH301C) were similar as judged by Western analysis (Fig. 1 A). We compared the activity of PB-ALDH and PB-ALDH301C using all-trans- (Fig. 1 B) or 9-cis- (Fig. 1 C) retinal as substrates. Similar to PB-ALDH, the mutant enzyme was inactive with all-trans-retinal, suggesting that this mutation is either not required or not sufficient to confer activity with all-trans-retinal to PB-ALDH. This mutation also reduced activity with 9-cis-retinal or with propanal substrates compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 1,C and D). Conversely, mutation of Cys301 to Ile in RALDH did not affect the capacity of the enzyme to catalyze all-trans- retinal oxidation (data not shown), suggesting that the identity of the amino acid at position 301 (Cys or Ile) does not influence enzymatic activity with all-trans-retinal. To identify which of the 52 amino acids that differ between RALDH and PB-ALDH (see Fig. 2) are responsible for their difference in substrate specificity, we exchanged fragments of the cDNAs of the two enzymes, resulting in chimeric enzymes switching identity at amino acid 131 or 343. The four chimeras (RALDH-131, PB-131, RALDH-343, and PB-343; see Fig. 3 A) were expressed in E. coli, and expression levels were monitored by Western blotting (Fig. 3 A). Conversion of all-trans-retinal to retinoic acid was assessed for the chimeras as well as the wild type. Similar to RALDH, RALDH-343, which contains amino acids 1–343 of RALDH and 344–500 of PB-ALDH, catalyzed the production of all-trans-retinoic acid, whereas the reciprocal chimera (PB-343), like PB-ALDH, was inactive (Fig. 3 B). Note that conversion of propanal could be observed with PB-343, demonstrating that this chimera is not catalytically inactive with all substrates (Fig. 3 C). Kinetic parameters measured for the RALDH-343 chimera with all-trans- and 9-cis-retinal (Fig. 4 B) indicate that catalytic efficiency is slightly increased for all-trans-retinal, whereas that for 9-cis-retinal is unchanged compared with RALDH (Table I). Together, these results suggest that the 10 amino acids that differ between RALDH and PB-ALDH from residues 344 to 500, which include 3 amino acids in the C-terminal loop of the substrate entrance tunnel, do not play a major role in the differential specificity of these enzymes for all-trans- or 9-cis-retinal. To further delineate regions of RALDH that are important for catalysis of all-trans- and 9-cis- retinal, we analyzed the activity of the RALDH-131 and PB-131 chimeras with these substrates. As observed with PB-343, PB-131 was inactive with all-trans-retinal but active with propanal (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting that amino acids 1–131 of RALDH are necessary for catalysis of all-trans-retinal. Note that PB-131, like RALDH and RALDH-343, was more active than PB-ALDH with propanal (Fig. 3 C). This suggests that the region from 131 to 343 of RALDH contains amino acids that are responsible for increased activity with propanal. Furthermore, chimera RALDH-131 was active with all-trans-retinal (Fig. 3 B), with a Vmax/Km comparable to that of RALDH (Fig. 5 C; Table I), suggesting that these amino acids are sufficient to confer activity with all-trans-retinal. Surprisingly, however, chimera RALDH-131 had very little activity for 9-cis-retinal (Fig. 5 A). We therefore investigated whether the reciprocal chimera had activity with this substrate. Indeed, although PB-131 was inactive with all-trans- retinal, it was active with 9-cis-retinal (Fig. 5, B and D), with a modest decrease in catalytic efficiency (about 2.5-fold) compared with the parental enzyme (Table I). These results, together with the observation that PB-343 is not active with 9-cis-retinal (data not shown), suggest that amino acids 131–343 of RALDH are important for catalysis of 9-cis-retinal. Thus, amino acids of RALDH that can confer activity to PB-ALDH with all-trans- and 9-cis-retinal are different, allowing the generation of enzymes selective for each retinal isomer (Fig. 5; Table I). We have previously demonstrated the existence of a class I aldehyde dehydrogenase that oxidizes retinal in rat kidney and purified this activity to homogeneity (18Labrecque J. Bhat P.V. Lacroix A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Results described here demonstrate that the characteristics observed with the enzyme purified from rat kidney are retained by the recombinant RALDH enzyme. The good correlation in Km values and the absence of activity with 13-cis retinal and the higher efficiency of 9-cis- versus all-trans-retinal conversion provide strong evidence that RALDH encodes the purified kidney enzyme (20Labrecque J. Dumas F. Lacroix A. Bhat P.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 681-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Our results also demonstrate that posttranslational modifications specific to eukaryotes are not needed for RALDH enzymatic activity, a result consistent with previous observations made with bacterially expressed ALDHs (27Kathmann E.C. Naylor S. Lipsky J.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 38: 1170-1176Google Scholar, 35Hsu L.C. Chang W.-C. Shibuya A. Yoshida A. J. Biol.

Contrary to what was observed with RALDH and to the high activity for retinal substrates reported for other class I ALDHs (10Lee M.-O. Manthey C.L. Sladek N.E. Biochem.

Dev. 2000; 95: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), PB-ALDH was inactive for all-trans-retinal oxidation, although its activity for propanal was in good agreement with previously published data (24Lindahl R. Evces S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11991-11996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is in keeping with the previously reported lack of all-trans-RA synthesis in vivo in a Xenopus embryo assay with mouse PB-ALDH (26Hsu L.C. Chang W.-C. Hoffmann I. Duester G. Biochem. J. 1999; 338 (385): 387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with results obtained with bacterially expressed PB-ALDH (27Kathmann E.C. Naylor S. Lipsky J.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 38: 1170-1176Google Scholar). In addition, we report here that PB-ALDH has only very low activity with 9-cis-retinal. Therefore, these two class I rat aldehyde dehydrogenases have differential activities with retinal substrates despite a high amino acid sequence identity (89.6%). Amino acids involved in binding of the NAD+ cofactor are nearly all conserved between RALDH and PB-ALDH, and the active site nucleophile Cys302 and general base Glu268 (30Perozich J. Nicholas H. Wang B.-C. Lindahl R. Hempel J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) are also conserved in the two enzymes. Interestingly, however, the amino acid immediately upstream of Cys302 is Ile in rat and mouse PB-ALDH, instead of the Cys seen in RALDH and all other class I ALDHs. In addition, the side chain of Cys301 is in a strikingly different position in the structures of ALDH1 and ALDH2 enzymes, possibly resulting in altered accessibility of the active site residue Cys302 (33Moore S.A. Baker H.M. Blythe T.J. Kitson K.E. Kitson T.M. Baker E.N. Structure. 1998; 6: 1541-1551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, our results suggest that the different identity of the amino acid at position 301 does not account for the lack of activity of PB-ALDH for retinal oxidation. Replacing Ile301 in PB-ALDH with Cys301 was not sufficient to observe activity with all-trans-retinal, and replacement of Cys301 in RALDH with Ile did not affect the capacity of RALDH to catalyze retinal oxidation. It has recently been suggested that the size and shape of the entrance tunnel of the class I sheep liver ALDH1 are likely to be the main determinants of the retinal specificity of this enzyme compared with the mitochondrial ALDH2 isozyme (32Steinmetz C.G. Xie P. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure. 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 33Moore S.A. Baker H.M. Blythe T.J. Kitson K.E. Kitson T.M. Baker E.N. Structure. 1998; 6: 1541-1551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), which is essentially inactive with all-trans-retinal (11Yoshida A. Hsu L.C. Davé V. Enzyme (Basel). 1992; 46: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Multiple differences in amino acid identity in the substrate entrance tunnel as well as differences in the structure of side chains of conserved amino acids result in a larger size of the ALDH1 substrate tunnel relative to ALDH2. The amino acid sequences of RALDH and PB-ALDH also differ in regions corresponding to the ALDH1 substrate entrance tunnel, which is formed from several structural elements that are part of both the nucleotide binding domain and the catalytic domain. Each of the structural elements contributing to the ALDH1 substrate entrance tunnel contains amino acids that differ between RALDH and PB-ALDH (Fig. 2): helix α C (residues 114–135; 8 different amino acids), helix α D (residues 170–185; 4 different amino acids), helix α H (residues 282–296; 3 different amino acids), and the C-terminal loop (residues 455–461; 3 different amino acids). Thus, a different shape of the substrate entrance tunnel may explain the absent or very weak activity of PB-ALDH for all-trans- or 9-cis-retinal substrates. In addition, note that in the absence of crystallographic data, we cannot exclude the possibility that different regions may contribute to the substrate entrance tunnel in RALDH and PB-ALDH. Some of the amino acids that may impart substrate specificity in the aldehyde dehydrogenase family are located in the C-terminal loop of the substrate entrance tunnel (31Liu Z.-J. Sun Y.-J. Rose J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6003-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, characterization of chimeras in which PB-ALDH and RALDH sequences have been exchanged at position 343 demonstrates that the 10 amino acids that differ between the two enzymes in this region, including three substitutions in the C-terminal loop, are not crucial for activity with retinal substrates. On the other hand, exchange of the N-terminal 131 amino acids demonstrates that structural determinants found in that region are both necessary and sufficient to confer to PB-ALDH the capacity to convert all-trans-retinal. This region includes 7 of the 8 amino acids that differ between the two enzymes in helix α C. Interestingly, several of the changes in helix α C involve replacement of large amino acids in PB-ALDH with smaller ones in RALDH. It is thus possible that steric hindrance in this region, which corresponds to the left wall of the substrate entrance tunnel, may explain the lack of reactivity of PB-ALDH with all-trans-retinal. Surprisingly, the N-terminal region of RALDH, although sufficient for activity with all-trans-retinal when linked to the complementary regions of PB-ALDH, did not confer activity with 9-cis-retinal. On the other hand, chimera PB-131, but not PB-343, was active with 9-cis-retinal. These results suggest that the 25 divergent amino acids between positions 131 and 343 are crucial for activity with 9-cis-retinal, but not all-trans-retinal. Because these amino acids include residues in helices α D and α H, differential binding of 9-cis-retinal between RALDH and PB-ALDH may also explain their different substrate specificity. It will be of interest in future studies to extend our direct comparison of the enzymatic properties of class I ALDHs with retinal substrates to other members of this family. We recently observed that purified human ALDH1 (ALDH1A1**) catalyzes conversion of all three retinal isomers with comparable efficiencies (37Bhat P.V. Samaha H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 57: 195-197Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), whereas RALDH does not catalyze 13-cis-retinal conversion and is more active with 9-cis-retinal versus all-trans- retinal. Thus, our results suggest that evolution within the class I ALDHs has led not only to different patterns of spatio-temporal expression but also to differences in substrate specificity and, possibly, differences in their roles in the control of local concentrations of retinoic acid isomers. Generation of transgenic mice expressing different class I ALDHs under the control of the same promoter should clarify the specific functions of each enzyme in different tissues. In addition, the availability of isomer-specific enzymes as described here should prove useful in the study of the mechanisms of interconversion among 9-cis-, all-trans-, and 13-cis-retinoid isomers, and of the specific roles played by each isomer of retinoic acid in development and differentiation in vivo. We are grateful to Drs. Ronald Lindahl and James J. Lipsky for the generous gift of polyclonal antibodies directed against PB-ALDH. We also thank Sharmeen Nasurt for excellent technical assistance."

Here we use satellite radar interferometry and airborne laser scanning to show that this island is 2 km long and 35 m high --- much larger than was originally reported. We have also been able to pinpoint the exact location of a stable area where a new group of small islands may be hidden. This demonstrates that satellite radar interferometry is an effective tool for finding ice-covered islands as well as for mapping them."
