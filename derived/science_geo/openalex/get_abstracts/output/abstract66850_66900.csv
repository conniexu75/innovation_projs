They undergo ""Michael-type"" addition to the polyfunctional sesquiterpene lactones. The rapid rates of reaction with L-cysteine were measured and the reaction products were characterized. Each addition of thiol successively decreased the cytotoxicity of the adducts formed."

https://openalex.org/W2029484462,"An electron microscopic procedure has been developed, using rat liver, for the localization of hormone-sensitive adenyl cyclase. Isoproterenol-sensitive adenyl cyclase is located almost exclusively in the parenchymal cells. In contrast, glucagon-sensitive adenyl cyclase is located primarily in the reticulo-endothelial cells but is also present in parenchymal cells. Sodium fluoride-sensitive adenyl cyclase is found in both cell types."

The restriction of this sensitivity in innervated muscle apparently involves muscle fibers.

At ambient below 18 degrees C oxygen consumption during torpor increased linearly with decreasing temperature. Thermal conductances were the same for resting and torpid Eulampis regulating their body temperatures at 40 degrees and 18 degrees C, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2034370576,Celestial orientation and setting of the biological clock in the southern cricket frog Acris gryllus can be cued by light stimuli received by extraoptic receptors in the brain. These extraoptic photoreceptors may also be used in learning new orientational directions. A mechanism for a light-activated biological clock is discussed.
https://openalex.org/W2108491727,"Infection of mouse and rat cells by the murine sarcoma virus (Moloney isolate) showed two-hit kinetics for focus production in mouse cells but one-hit kinetics in rat cells. Antiserum added to cultures after infection suppressed focus formation in mouse cells but not in rat cells. These studies suggest that, in rat cells infected with murine sarcoma virus, leukemia virus is not needed for focus formation and that these foci result from proliferation of the transformed rat cell; in mouse cells, on the other hand, leukemia virus is needed as ""helper,"" and focus formation requires spread of virus. The term ""defectiveness"" then, if used, should not be applied to RNA tumor viruses without qualification for the viral function studied and the cell system employed."

Three times this dose is safe for broiler chickens. In dogs and rats, the toxicity was relatively low over a period of 90 days. In laboratory trials, the drug completely prevents oocyst production by seven species and greatly reduces oocyst production by Eimeria maxima."

When extracts from ihe brains of donor rats given interpolated rest during acquisition training were injected into recipient animals, statistically reliable and experimentally reproducible ""memory transfer"" effects were found."

https://openalex.org/W2053305124,"INORGANIC phosphates are effective in reducing dental caries when added as supplements to cariogenic diets fed to rodents1, and when added to chewing gum2 and to breakfast cereal eaten by children3. Because the caries process may be influenced by pellicle proteins4, and salivary proteins adsorbed to human enamel are differentially eluted by water and orthophosphate solutions5, we reasoned that the cariostatic effect of phosphate might involve one or both of the following processes: (a) differential elution of proteins adsorbed on enamel; (b) modification of the enamel surface resulting in an alteration of the acquired protein layer. To test this hypothesis in a model system we have studied the effects of phosphates on enzymes adsorbed to human enamel."
https://openalex.org/W1973471649,"To an observer whose one eye is covered with a relatively strong filter (approximately 90 percent extinction) and who views a landscape from the side window of a moving automobile, the velocity of the vehicle appears to be markedly reduced when the uncovered eye is in the forward or leading position (in the sense of motion of the vehicle); the velocity seems to be increased when the covered eye is in the leading position. The illusion of reduced velocity is accompanied by an apparent dwarfing of objects near the roadside and an apparent foreshortening of the distance between object and observer; the illusion of increased velocity is accompanied by an apparent increase in size of objects and an increase in their apparent distance. These illusions can be understood as corollaries of the well-known Pulfrich phenomenon."

https://openalex.org/W1985968127,"Addition of antimycin A to a culture of Tetrahymena pyriformis caused an increase in cell division and protein synthesis in this ciliated protozoan. The antimycin effect is a function of the time of exposure to the antibiotic as well as of the age of the culture. A large accumulation of endoplasmic reticulum, reflecting increased protein synthesis, was visualized by electron microscopy in cells stimulated by the antimycin A."

https://openalex.org/W1994538629,"THE recognition of its tRNA substrate by an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is an essential step in the translation of genetic information into amino-acid sequences of proteins. An understanding of this recognition requires a knowledge of the structure of the enzyme. Several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been prepared in highly purified form, but they have so far not been obtained in a crystalline form suitable for crystallographic analysis1â€“3. We report the crystallization of a lysyl-tRNA synthetase purified from yeast."

https://openalex.org/W2056828995,"Radiation risk: A scientific problem? by Robert Holcomb (6 Feb., p.853) is an amazingly accurate report of the direct frontal on existing guidelines for limiting radiation exposure and recommendations of the world's experts in mammalian radiation biology. Holcomb's report echoes the unemotional aspects of many radio biologists'
reactions to the Gofman Tamplin challenge; however, when dissecting the attack in terms of opinion versus evidence, risk versus benefit, and extrapolation versus measurement, some key issues perhaps have been camouflaged."
