https://openalex.org/W1979358457,"NORTHROP and co-workers have shown1 that pepsin in solution digests itself with the formation of material soluble in trichloroacetic acid. The amount of non-protein substance formed depends upon factors such as time, temperature, and the pH and composition of the solvent. It has now been found in this laboratory that if autodigestion of pepsin proceeds at pH values removed from those optimal for proteolysis, pH 1.5–2.0, activity can be recovered in the non-protein fraction."

It is thus possible to establish four blood groups for the blood platelets, similar to the blood groups in erythrocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2024275154,"ANHYDROUS hydrogen fluoride (m.p., − 83° C.; b.p., 19.5° C.) has been found to be a powerful solvent for a wide variety of proteins. Experiments were carried out in transparent tubes moulded or machined from polychlorotrifluoroethylene polymer; these tubes containing the intensively dried protein samples could be attached to a metal vacuum system, hydrogen fluoride added by distillation, and direct visual observations made in the absence of moisture. Among proteins which are readily soluble in hydrogen fluoride at 0° are ribonuclease, lysozyme, pepsin, trypsin, crystallized egg albumin, bovine plasma albumin, bovine plasma globulin, edestin, peanut protein globulin, casein, zein, silk fibroin, hide collagen, insulin and adrenocorticotrophic hormone. These are all soluble at least to the extent of 20 mgm. per ml., and much more concentrated solutions can in general easily be prepared. Thus, a solution containing 350 mgm. per ml. bovine plasma albumin is still quite fluid at 0° C. The solutions are clear, colourless to faint amber, and are very much less viscous than corresponding aqueous solutions. The globular proteins dissolve rapidly even at − 78° C., whereas silk fibroin and hide collagen undergo strong swelling and require many hours at room temperature for complete solution."

The heart-rate of an average (10 mm.) individual at summer temperature was 180–200 per min., but heart-beat was interrupted for short periods, for example, at the onset of a burst of locomotor activity. Dissection of the preparation always slowed and sometimes arrested the beat for periods up to 30 min. On recovery, the beat was regular and incessant, often at the maximal normal rate."

These images, due to chemical action of the specimen on the emulsion, were termed histochemographs."

This communication reports that ultra-violet irradiation of tobacco infected with potato virus Y can reduce the availability of virus to aphids without causing apparent injury to the plants or greatly reducing the infectivity of sap extracts as measured by starch – iodine lesions."

https://openalex.org/W2091345483,"USING a method described elsewhere1, we have been able to cut serial sections of about 250 A. thickness, and, by varying the speed of cutting successive sections, serial sections of thickness alternately about 350 A. and 150 A. There were always thin and thick areas within individual sections. On the basis of the general rule suggested by Cosslett2, that the optimum resolution obtainable from a section is of the order of one-tenth of the thickness, the thinner parts of the 150 A. sections should afford resolutions of 10 A. We have succeeded in obtaining such resolutions, as illustrated in Fig. 1."
