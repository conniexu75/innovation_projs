https://openalex.org/W2042816890,"Cytoplasmic DNA is an important trigger for the innate immune system. The downstream signalling pathways involved in this process have been extensively characterized, but much less is known about the initial step, the recognition of the DNA. Two groups reporting in this issue of Nature have now identified AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2), a member of the interferon-inducible HIN-200 family, as a cytoplasmic DNA sensor. In the presence of DNA, AIM2 oligermerizes and associates with the adapter molecule ASC to activate NF-κB and caspase-1, key components of the inflammasome complex. This highlights the AIM2 inflammasome as a possible target for the treatment of both infections and autoimmune diseases. This paper shows that the protein AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) is a receptor of cytoplasmic DNA and the double-stranded DNA vaccinia virus, and is a component of the inflammasome pathway for caspase-1 activation. The innate immune system senses nucleic acids by germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors. RNA is sensed by Toll-like receptor members TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8, or by the RNA helicases RIG-I (also known as DDX58 ) and MDA-5 (IFIH1)1. Little is known about sensors for cytoplasmic DNA that trigger antiviral and/or inflammatory responses2,3,4,5,6. The best characterized of these responses involves activation of the TANK-binding kinase (TBK1)–interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signalling axis to trigger transcriptional induction of type I interferon genes2,3. A second, less well-defined pathway leads to the activation of an ‘inflammasome’ that, via caspase-1, controls the catalytic cleavage of the pro-forms of the cytokines IL1β and IL18 (refs 6, 7). Using mouse and human cells, here we identify the PYHIN (pyrin and HIN domain-containing protein)8 family member absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) as a receptor for cytosolic DNA, which regulates caspase-1. The HIN200 domain of AIM2 binds to DNA, whereas the pyrin domain (but not that of the other PYHIN family members) associates with the adaptor molecule ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain) to activate both NF-κB and caspase-1. Knockdown of Aim2 abrogates caspase-1 activation in response to cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA and the double-stranded DNA vaccinia virus. Collectively, these observations identify AIM2 as a new receptor for cytoplasmic DNA, which forms an inflammasome with the ligand and ASC to activate caspase-1."

This highlights the AIM2 inflammasome as a possible target for the treatment of both infections and autoimmune diseases. In this paper AIM2 is shown to sense cytoplasmic DNA and to interact with ASC in activation of caspase-1. Host- and pathogen-associated cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA triggers the activation of a NALP3 (also known as cryopyrin and NLRP3)-independent inflammasome1, which activates caspase-1 leading to maturation of pro-interleukin-1β and inflammation. The nature of the cytoplasmic-DNA-sensing inflammasome is currently unknown. Here we show that AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2), an interferon-inducible HIN-200 family member that contains an amino-terminal pyrin domain and a carboxy-terminal oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding domain2,3, senses cytoplasmic DNA by means of its oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding domain and interacts with ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) through its pyrin domain to activate caspase-1. The interaction of AIM2 with ASC also leads to the formation of the ASC pyroptosome4, which induces pyroptotic cell death in cells containing caspase-1. Knockdown of AIM2 by short interfering RNA reduced inflammasome/pyroptosome activation by cytoplasmic DNA in human and mouse macrophages, whereas stable expression of AIM2 in the non-responsive human embryonic kidney 293T cell line conferred responsiveness to cytoplasmic DNA. Our results show that cytoplasmic DNA triggers formation of the AIM2 inflammasome by inducing AIM2 oligomerization. This study identifies AIM2 as an important inflammasome component that senses potentially dangerous cytoplasmic DNA, leading to activation of the ASC pyroptosome and caspase-1."
https://openalex.org/W2039583570,"With the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic of 2003 and renewed attention on avian influenza viral pandemics, new surveillance systems are needed for the earlier detection of emerging infectious diseases. We applied a “next-generation” parallel sequencing platform for viral detection in nasopharyngeal and fecal samples collected during seasonal influenza virus (Flu) infections and norovirus outbreaks from 2005 to 2007 in Osaka, Japan. Random RT-PCR was performed to amplify RNA extracted from 0.1–0.25 ml of nasopharyngeal aspirates (N = 3) and fecal specimens (N = 5), and more than 10 µg of cDNA was synthesized. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing of these 8 samples yielded 15,298–32,335 (average 24,738) reads in a single 7.5 h run. In nasopharyngeal samples, although whole genome analysis was not available because the majority (>90%) of reads were host genome–derived, 20–460 Flu-reads were detected, which was sufficient for subtype identification. In fecal samples, bacteria and host cells were removed by centrifugation, resulting in gain of 484–15,260 reads of norovirus sequence (78–98% of the whole genome was covered), except for one specimen that was under-detectable by RT-PCR. These results suggest that our unbiased high-throughput sequencing approach is useful for directly detecting pathogenic viruses without advance genetic information. Although its cost and technological availability make it unlikely that this system will very soon be the diagnostic standard worldwide, this system could be useful for the earlier discovery of novel emerging viruses and bioterrorism, which are difficult to detect with conventional procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2112964373,"The annual cycle in the Earth's surface temperature is extremely large-comparable in magnitude to the glacial-interglacial cycles over most of the planet. Trends in the phase and the amplitude of the annual cycle have been observed, but the causes and significance of these changes remain poorly understood-in part because we lack an understanding of the natural variability. Here we show that the phase of the annual cycle of surface temperature over extratropical land shifted towards earlier seasons by 1.7 days between 1954 and 2007; this change is highly anomalous with respect to earlier variations, which we interpret as being indicative of the natural range. Significant changes in the amplitude of the annual cycle are also observed between 1954 and 2007. These shifts in the annual cycles appear to be related, in part, to changes in the northern annular mode of climate variability, although the land phase shift is significantly larger than that predicted by trends in the northern annular mode alone. Few of the climate models presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reproduce the observed decrease in amplitude and none reproduce the shift towards earlier seasons."
https://openalex.org/W2081069100,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a novel class of endogenous, small, noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate approximately 30% of genes in a cell via degradation or translational inhibition of their target mRNAs. However, the effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on miRNA expression and the roles of miRNAs in ROS-mediated gene regulation and biological functions of vascular cells are unclear. Using microarray analysis, we demonstrated that miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) after treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). H(2)O(2)-mediated up-regulation of microRNA-21 (miR-21) was further confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. To determine the potential roles of miRNAs in H(2)O(2)-mediated gene regulation and cellular effects, miR-21 expression was down-regulated by miR-21 inhibitor and up-regulated by pre-miR-21. H(2)O(2)-induced VSMC apoptosis and death were increased by miR-21 inhibitor and decreased by pre-miR-21. Programmed cell death 4(PDCD4) was a direct target of miR-21 that was involved in miR-21-mediated effects on VSMCs. Pre-miR-21-mediated protective effect on VSMC apoptosis and death was blocked via adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PDCD4 without the miR-21 binding site. Moreover, activator protein 1 was a downstream signaling molecule of PDCD4 in miR-21-modulated VSMCs. The results suggest that miRNAs in VSMCs are sensitive to H(2)O(2) stimulation. miRN-21 participates in H(2)O(2)-mediated gene regulation and cellular injury response through PDCD4 and the activator protein 1 pathway. miRNAs might play a role in vascular diseases related to ROS."
https://openalex.org/W2012474366,"Background Implicit racial bias denotes socio-cognitive attitudes towards other-race groups that are exempt from conscious awareness. In parallel, other-race faces are more difficult to differentiate relative to own-race faces – the “Other-Race Effect.” To examine the relationship between these two biases, we trained Caucasian subjects to better individuate other-race faces and measured implicit racial bias for those faces both before and after training. Methodology/Principal Findings Two groups of Caucasian subjects were exposed equally to the same African American faces in a training protocol run over 5 sessions. In the individuation condition, subjects learned to discriminate between African American faces. In the categorization condition, subjects learned to categorize faces as African American or not. For both conditions, both pre- and post-training we measured the Other-Race Effect using old-new recognition and implicit racial biases using a novel implicit social measure – the “Affective Lexical Priming Score” (ALPS). Subjects in the individuation condition, but not in the categorization condition, showed improved discrimination of African American faces with training. Concomitantly, subjects in the individuation condition, but not the categorization condition, showed a reduction in their ALPS. Critically, for the individuation condition only, the degree to which an individual subject's ALPS decreased was significantly correlated with the degree of improvement that subject showed in their ability to differentiate African American faces. Conclusions/Significance Our results establish a causal link between the Other-Race Effect and implicit racial bias. We demonstrate that training that ameliorates the perceptual Other-Race Effect also reduces socio-cognitive implicit racial bias. These findings suggest that implicit racial biases are multifaceted, and include malleable perceptual skills that can be modified with relatively little training."
https://openalex.org/W2064085644,"Background Attentional dysfunction is related to functional disability in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer's disease. Indeed, sustained attention/vigilance is among the leading targets for new medications designed to improve cognition in schizophrenia. Although vigilance is assessed frequently using the continuous performance test (CPT) in humans, few tests specifically assess vigilance in rodents. Methods We describe the 5-choice CPT (5C-CPT), an elaboration of the 5-choice serial reaction (5CSR) task that includes non-signal trials, thus mimicking task parameters of human CPTs that use signal and non-signal events to assess vigilance. The performances of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice were assessed in the 5C-CPT to determine whether this task could differentiate between strains. C57BL/6J mice were also trained in the 5CSR task and a simple reaction-time (RT) task involving only one choice (1CRT task). We hypothesized that: 1) C57BL/6J performance would be superior to DBA/2J mice in the 5C-CPT as measured by the sensitivity index measure from signal detection theory; 2) a vigilance decrement would be observed in both strains; and 3) RTs would increase across tasks with increased attentional load (1CRT task<5CSR task<5C-CPT). Conclusions C57BL/6J mice exhibited superior SI levels compared to DBA/2J mice, but with no difference in accuracy. A vigilance decrement was observed in both strains, which was more pronounced in DBA/2J mice and unaffected by response bias. Finally, we observed increased RTs with increased attentional load, such that 1CRT task<5CSR task<5C-CPT, consistent with human performance in simple RT, choice RT, and CPT tasks. Thus we have demonstrated construct validity for the 5C-CPT as a measure of vigilance that is analogous to human CPT studies."
https://openalex.org/W2137777741,"Maternal obesity may affect the child's long-term development and health. However, there is little information about the involvement of maternal obesity in the brain development of offspring. Here, we investigated the effects of maternal obesity on the hippocampal formation of offspring. Adult female mice were fed either a normal diet (ND, 4% fat) or a high-fat diet (HFD, 32% fat) 6 wk before mating and throughout pregnancy and the majority of lactation. We found that infants from HFD-fed dams (HFD offspring) showed obesity and hyperlipidemia during suckling. In HFD offspring, lipid peroxidation was promoted in serum and the hippocampal dentate gyrus, where neurogenesis takes place throughout postnatal life. Using a BrdU-pulse labeling study, we showed that malondialdehyde, a product of peroxidized lipids, reduced the proliferation of hippocampal progenitor cells in vitro and that neurogenesis in HFD offspring during postnatal development was similarly lowered relative to the ND animals. These results indicated that maternal obesity impairs hippocampal progenitor cell division and neuronal production in young offspring possibly due to metabolic and oxidative changes."
https://openalex.org/W2054198670,"Humans are genetically defective in synthesizing the common mammalian sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), but can metabolically incorporate it from dietary sources (particularly red meat and milk) into glycoproteins and glycolipids of human tumors, fetuses and some normal tissues. Metabolic incorporation of Neu5Gc from animal-derived cells and medium components also results in variable contamination of molecules and cells intended for human therapies. These Neu5Gc-incorporation phenomena are practically significant, because normal humans can have high levels of circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies. Thus, there is need for the sensitive and specific detection of Neu5Gc in human tissues and biotherapeutic products. Unlike monoclonal antibodies that recognize Neu5Gc only in the context of underlying structures, chicken immunoglobulin Y (IgY) polyclonal antibodies can recognize Neu5Gc in broader contexts. However, prior preparations of such antibodies (including our own) suffered from some non-specificity, as well as some cross-reactivity with the human sialic acid N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac).We have developed a novel affinity method utilizing sequential columns of immobilized human and chimpanzee serum sialoglycoproteins, followed by specific elution from the latter column by free Neu5Gc. The resulting mono-specific antibody shows no staining in tissues or cells from mice with a human-like defect in Neu5Gc production. It allows sensitive and specific detection of Neu5Gc in all underlying glycan structural contexts studied, and is applicable to immunohistochemical, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot and flow cytometry analyses. Non-immune chicken IgY is used as a reliable negative control. We show that these approaches allow sensitive detection of Neu5Gc in human tissue samples and in some biotherapeutic products, and finally show an example of how Neu5Gc might be eliminated from such products, by using a human cell line grown under defined conditions.We report a reliable antibody-based method for highly sensitive and specific detection of the non-human sialic acid Neu5Gc in human tissues and biotherapeutic products that has not been previously described."
https://openalex.org/W2039391338,"Background Although disease remission can frequently be achieved for patients with neuroblastoma, relapse is common. The cancer stem cell theory suggests that rare tumorigenic cells, resistant to conventional therapy, are responsible for relapse. If true for neuroblastoma, improved cure rates may only be achieved via identification and therapeutic targeting of the neuroblastoma tumor initiating cell. Based on cues from normal stem cells, evidence for tumor populating progenitor cells has been found in a variety of cancers. Methodology/Principal Findings Four of eight human neuroblastoma cell lines formed tumorspheres in neural stem cell media, and all contained some cells that expressed neurogenic stem cell markers including CD133, ABCG2, and nestin. Three lines tested could be induced into multi-lineage differentiation. LA-N-5 spheres were further studied and showed a verapamil-sensitive side population, relative resistance to doxorubicin, and CD133+ cells showed increased sphere formation and tumorigenicity. Oncolytic viruses, engineered to be clinically safe by genetic mutation, are emerging as next generation anticancer therapeutics. Because oncolytic viruses circumvent typical drug-resistance mechanisms, they may represent an effective therapy for chemotherapy-resistant tumor initiating cells. A Nestin-targeted oncolytic herpes simplex virus efficiently replicated within and killed neuroblastoma tumor initiating cells preventing their ability to form tumors in athymic nude mice. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that human neuroblastoma contains tumor initiating cells that may be effectively targeted by an oncolytic virus."
https://openalex.org/W2066833380,"Chromosome condensation and the global repression of gene transcription are features of mitosis in most eukaryotes. The logic behind this phenomenon is that chromosome condensation prevents the activity of RNA polymerases. In budding yeast, however, transcription was proposed to be continuous during mitosis. Here we show that Cdc14, a protein phosphatase required for nucleolar segregation and mitotic exit, inhibits transcription of yeast ribosomal genes (rDNA) during anaphase. The phosphatase activity of Cdc14 is required for RNA polymerase I (Pol I) inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Moreover Cdc14-dependent inhibition involves nucleolar exclusion of Pol I subunits. We demonstrate that transcription inhibition is necessary for complete chromosome disjunction, because ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcripts block condensin binding to rDNA, and show that bypassing the role of Cdc14 in nucleolar segregation requires in vivo degradation of nascent transcripts. Our results show that transcription interferes with chromosome condensation, not the reverse. We conclude that budding yeast, like most eukaryotes, inhibit Pol I transcription before segregation as a prerequisite for chromosome condensation and faithful genome separation."
https://openalex.org/W1979560290,"The regulation of lipid homeostasis by insulin is mediated in part by the enhanced transcription of the gene encoding SREBP-1c (sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c). Nascent SREBP-1c is synthesized and embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and must be transported to the Golgi in coatomer protein II (COPII) vesicles where two sequential cleavages generate the transcriptionally active NH(2)-terminal fragment, nSREBP-1c. There is limited indirect evidence to suggest that insulin may also regulate the posttranslational processing of the nascent SREBP-1c protein. Therefore, we designed experiments to directly assess the action of insulin on the post-translational processing of epitope-tagged full-length SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 proteins expressed in cultured hepatocytes. We demonstrate that insulin treatment led to enhanced post-translational processing of SREBP-1c, which was associated with phosphorylation of ER-bound nascent SREBP-1c protein that increased affinity of the SREBP-1c cleavage-activating protein (SCAP)-SREBP-1c complex for the Sec23/24 proteins of the COPII vesicles. Furthermore, chemical and molecular inhibitors of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway and its downstream kinase protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt prevented both insulin-mediated phosphorylation of nascent SREBP-1c protein and its posttranslational processing. Insulin had no effect on the proteolysis of nascent SREBP-2 under identical conditions. We also show that in vitro incubation of an active PKB/Akt enzyme with recombinant full-length SREBP-1c led to its phosphorylation. Thus, insulin selectively stimulates the processing of SREBP-1c in rat hepatocytes by enhancing the association between the SCAP-SREBP-1c complex and COPII proteins and subsequent ER to Golgi transport and proteolytic cleavage. This effect of insulin is tightly linked to phosphoinositide 3-kinase and PKB/Akt-dependent serine phosphorylation of the precursor SREBP-1c protein."
https://openalex.org/W2051760280,"How does the brain encode depth (or 3D) information without confusing it with other visual cues in the environment? Depth perception in animals that use binocular vision is achieved by comparing differences between the images received by each eye. Some neurons in the visual cortex respond to such disparities while others have a preference for inputs from one or other eye (ocular dominance). Using two-photon calcium imaging Prakash Kara and Jamie Boyd were able to map the response of nearly every neuron in a small region of the cat visual cortex, and found that the responses to ocular dominance and binocular disparity exist on defined axes within the brain: the map that encodes 3D information is aligned at right-angles to another functional map that signals the relative strength of visual inputs arriving at each eye. The relative arrangement of the two maps provides important clues as to how local circuits in the brain can simultaneously and seamlessly process multiple sensory features in the environment. Using two-photon calcium imaging these authors map the response of nearly every neuron in a small region of the cat visual cortex, and find that the responses to ocular dominance and binocular disparity exist on defined axes within the brain that are independent and orthogonal to each other. In invertebrate predators such as the praying mantis and vertebrate predators such as wild cats the ability to detect small differences in inter-ocular retinal disparities is a critical means for accurately determining the depth of moving objects such as prey1. In mammals, the first neurons along the visual pathway that encode binocular disparities are found in the visual cortex. However, a precise functional architecture for binocular disparity has never been demonstrated in any species, and coarse maps for disparity have been found in only one primate species2,3. Moreover, the dominant approach for assaying the developmental plasticity of binocular cortical neurons used monocular tests of ocular dominance to infer binocular function4. The few studies that examined the relationship between ocular dominance and binocular disparity of individual cells used single-unit recordings and have provided conflicting results regarding whether ocular dominance can predict the selectivity or sensitivity to binocular disparity5,6,7,8,9. We used two-photon calcium imaging to sample the response to monocular and binocular visual stimuli from nearly every adjacent neuron in a small region of the cat visual cortex, area 18. Here we show that local circuits for ocular dominance always have smooth and graded transitions from one apparently monocular functional domain to an adjacent binocular region. Most unexpectedly, we discovered a new map in the cat visual cortex that had a precise functional micro-architecture for binocular disparity selectivity. At the level of single cells, ocular dominance was unrelated to binocular disparity selectivity or sensitivity. When the local maps for ocular dominance and binocular disparity both had measurable gradients at a given cortical site, the two gradient directions were orthogonal to each other. Together, these results indicate that, from the perspective of the spiking activity of individual neurons, ocular dominance cannot predict binocular disparity tuning. However, the precise local arrangement of ocular dominance and binocular disparity maps provide new clues regarding how monocular and binocular depth cues may be combined and decoded."
https://openalex.org/W1975195662,"Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) is the main regulator of the stress response that triggers the transcription of several genes encoding heat shock proteins (Hsps). Hsps act as molecular chaperones involved in protein folding, stability, and trafficking. HSF1 is highly expressed in oocytes and Hsf1 knock-out in mice revealed that in the absence of stress this factor plays an important role in female reproduction. We previously reported that Hsf1(-/-) females produce oocytes but no viable embryos. Consequently, we asked whether oocytes require HSF1 to regulate a particular set of Hsps necessary for them to develop. We find that Hsp90alpha (Hspaa1) is the major HSF1-dependent chaperone inasmuch as Hsf1 knock-out resulted in Hsp90-depleted oocytes. These oocytes exhibited delayed germinal vesicle breakdown (or G(2)/M transition), partial meiosis I block, and defective asymmetrical division. To probe the role of Hsp90alpha in this meiotic syndrome, we analyzed meiotic maturation in wild-type oocytes treated with a specific inhibitor of Hsp90, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxy-geldanamycin, and observed similar defects. At the molecular level we showed that, together with these developmental anomalies, CDK1 and MAPK, key meiotic kinases, were significantly disturbed. Thus, our data demonstrate that HSF1 is a maternal transcription factor essential for normal progression of meiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2121087785,"The performance of the tuberculosis specific Interferon Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs) has not been sufficiently documented in tuberculosis- and HIV-endemic settings. This study evaluated the sensitivity of the QuantiFERON TB-Gold In-Tube (QFT-IT) in patients with culture confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in a TB- and HIV-endemic population and the effect of HIV-infection and CD4 cell count on test performance.161 patients with sputum culture confirmed PTB were subjected to HIV- and QFT-IT testing and measurement of CD4 cell count. The QFT-IT was positive in 74% (119/161; 95% CI: 67-81%). Sensitivity was higher in HIV-negative (75/93) than in HIV-positive (44/68) patients (81% vs. 65%, p = 0.02) and increased with CD4 cell count in HIV-positive patients (test for trend p = 0.03). 23 patients (14%) had an indeterminate result and this proportion decreased with increasing CD4 cell count in HIV-positive patients (test for trend p = 0.03). Low CD4 cell count (<300 cells/microl) did not account for all QFT-IT indeterminate nor all negative results. Sensitivity when excluding indeterminate results was 86% (95% CI: 81-92%) and did not differ between HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients (88 vs. 83%, p = 0.39).Sensitivity of the QFT-IT for diagnosing active PTB infection was reasonable when excluding indeterminate results and in HIV-negative patients. However, since the test missed more than 10% of patients, its potential as a rule-out test for active TB disease is limited. Furthermore, test performance is impaired by low CD4 cell count in HIV-positive patients and possibly by other factors as well in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. This might limit the potential of the test in populations where HIV-infection is prevalent."
https://openalex.org/W2086025948,"The early evolution and diversification of Hox-related genes in eumetazoans has been the subject of conflicting hypotheses concerning the evolutionary conservation of their role in axial patterning and the pre-bilaterian origin of the Hox and ParaHox clusters. The diversification of Hox/ParaHox genes clearly predates the origin of bilaterians. However, the existence of a ""Hox code"" predating the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor and supporting the deep homology of axes is more controversial. This assumption was mainly based on the interpretation of Hox expression data from the sea anemone, but growing evidence from other cnidarian taxa puts into question this hypothesis.Hox, ParaHox and Hox-related genes have been investigated here by phylogenetic analysis and in situ hybridisation in Clytia hemisphaerica, an hydrozoan species with medusa and polyp stages alternating in the life cycle. Our phylogenetic analyses do not support an origin of ParaHox and Hox genes by duplication of an ancestral ProtoHox cluster, and reveal a diversification of the cnidarian HOX9-14 genes into three groups called A, B, C. Among the 7 examined genes, only those belonging to the HOX9-14 and the CDX groups exhibit a restricted expression along the oral-aboral axis during development and in the planula larva, while the others are expressed in very specialised areas at the medusa stage.Cross species comparison reveals a strong variability of gene expression along the oral-aboral axis and during the life cycle among cnidarian lineages. The most parsimonious interpretation is that the Hox code, collinearity and conservative role along the antero-posterior axis are bilaterian innovations."
https://openalex.org/W2043102080,"The neurotensin (NTS) and its specific high affinity G protein coupled receptor, the NT1 receptor (NTSR1), are considered to be a good candidate for one of the factors implicated in neoplastic progression. In breast cancer cells, functionally expressed NT1 receptor coordinates a series of transforming functions including cellular migration and invasion.we investigated the expression of NTS and NTSR1 in normal human breast tissue and in invasive ductal breast carcinomas (IDCs) by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. NTS is expressed and up-regulated by estrogen in normal epithelial breast cells. NTS is also found expressed in the ductal and invasive components of IDCs. The high expression of NTSR1 is associated with the SBR grade, the size of the tumor, and the number of metastatic lymph nodes. Furthermore, the NTSR1 high expression is an independent factor of prognosis associated with the death of patients.these data support the activation of neurotensinergic deleterious pathways in breast cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2100481486,"The deficit of pancreatic islet beta cells caused by autoimmune destruction is a crucial issue in type 1 diabetes (T1D). It is essential to fundamentally control the autoimmunity for treatment of T1D. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a pivotal role in maintaining self-tolerance through their inhibitory impact on autoreactive effector T cells. An abnormality of Tregs is associated with initiation of progression of T1D.Here, we report that treatment of established autoimmune-caused diabetes in NOD mice with purified autologous CD4(+)CD62L(+) Tregs co-cultured with human cord blood stem cells (CB-SC) can eliminate hyperglycemia, promote islet beta-cell regeneration to increase beta-cell mass and insulin production, and reconstitute islet architecture. Correspondingly, treatment with CB-SC-modulated CD4(+)CD62L(+) Tregs (mCD4CD62L Tregs) resulted in a marked reduction of insulitis, restored Th1/Th2 cytokine balance in blood, and induced apoptosis of infiltrated leukocytes in pancreatic islets.These data demonstrate that treatment with mCD4CD62L Tregs can reverse overt diabetes, providing a novel strategy for the treatment of type 1 diabetes as well as other autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2030379516,"Glutaredoxins (Grxs) are efficient catalysts for the reduction of mixed disulfides in glutathionylated proteins, using glutathione or thioredoxin reductases for their regeneration. Using GFP fusion, we have shown that poplar GrxS12, which possesses a monothiol (28)WCSYS(32) active site, is localized in chloroplasts. In the presence of reduced glutathione, the recombinant protein is able to reduce in vitro substrates, such as hydroxyethyldisulfide and dehydroascorbate, and to regenerate the glutathionylated glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Although the protein possesses two conserved cysteines, it is functioning through a monothiol mechanism, the conserved C terminus cysteine (Cys(87)) being dispensable, since the C87S variant is fully active in all activity assays. Biochemical and crystallographic studies revealed that Cys(87) exhibits a certain reactivity, since its pK(a) is around 5.6. Coupled with thiol titration, fluorescence, and mass spectrometry analyses, the resolution of poplar GrxS12 x-ray crystal structure shows that the only oxidation state is a glutathionylated derivative of the active site cysteine (Cys(29)) and that the enzyme does not form inter- or intramolecular disulfides. Contrary to some plant Grxs, GrxS12 does not incorporate an iron-sulfur cluster in its wild-type form, but when the active site is mutated into YCSYS, it binds a [2Fe-2S] cluster, indicating that the single Trp residue prevents this incorporation."
https://openalex.org/W2029685980,"The retinal pigment epithelium is a primary site of pathology in age-related macular degeneration. Oxidative stress and senescence are both thought to be important mediators of macular degeneration pathogenesis. We demonstrate here that bone morphogenetic protein-4 is highly expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium and adjacent extracellular matrix of patients with dry age-related macular degeneration. In vitro studies revealed that sublethal oxidative stress increased bone morphogenetic protein-4 expression in retinal pigment epithelial cells, and both bone morphogenetic protein-4 and persistent mild oxidative stress can induce retinal pigment epithelial cell senescence through p53-p21Cip1/WAF1-Rb pathway. We further demonstrate that bone morphogenetic protein-4 acts as a mediator in oxidative stress-induced senescence and that this mediator function is via Smad and the p38 signaling pathway to increase and activate p53 and p21Cip1/WAF1 and decrease phospho-Rb. Oxidative stress-induced senescence can be blocked by Chordin-like, an antagonist of bone morphogenetic protein-4, or SB203580, a phospho-p38 inhibitor. Our results suggest that oxidative stress and bone morphogenetic protein-4 may interact to promote retinal pigment epithelial cell senescence and that bone morphogenetic protein-4 may represent a novel therapeutic target to inhibit the progressive effects of oxidative stress and senescence in dry age-related macular degeneration.

We further demonstrate that bone morphogenetic protein-4 acts as a mediator in oxidative stress-induced senescence and that this mediator function is via Smad and the p38 signaling pathway to increase and activate p53 and p21Cip1/WAF1 and decrease phospho-Rb. Oxidative stress-induced senescence can be blocked by Chordin-like, an antagonist of bone morphogenetic protein-4, or SB203580, a phospho-p38 inhibitor. Our results suggest that oxidative stress and bone morphogenetic protein-4 may interact to promote retinal pigment epithelial cell senescence and that bone morphogenetic protein-4 may represent a novel therapeutic target to inhibit the progressive effects of oxidative stress and senescence in dry age-related macular degeneration. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) 2The abbreviations used are: AMD, age-related macular degeneration; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; GA, geographic atrophy; SA-β-galactosidase, senescence-associated β-galactosidase; BMP4, bone morphogenetic protein-4; tBH, tert-butylhydroperoxide; BrdU, bromodeoxyuridine; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the developed world. An extensive literature of basic and clinical studies implicates the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) as a primary site of pathology in both early and late forms of the disease (1de Jong P.T. N.

RPE cells normally form a quiescent monolayer between the photoreceptors and the vascular choroid that is essential for the retinoid cycle, nutritional support of photoreceptors, and the outer blood retina barrier. In early “dry” AMD, although vision is not usually affected, the RPE accumulates lipofuscin and participates in the formation of extracellular drusen deposits in the macular region of the retina. The greater the number and size of macular drusen, the greater the risk of progression to the two late blinding forms of AMD. Geographic atrophy (GA), or advanced dry AMD, is characterized by degeneration and loss of RPE and associated photoreceptors (5Zarbin M.A. Arch. Ophthalmol. 2004; 122: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 6Klein M.L. Ferris 3rd, F.L. Armstrong J. Hwang T.S. Chew E.Y. Bressler S.B. Chandra S.R.

In contrast, advanced “wet” AMD is associated with activation of RPE, expression of angiogenic growth factors, and the growth of new vessels from the choroid through Bruch membrane to a site adjacent to the RPE layer (9Holz F.G. Pauleikhoff D. Klein R. Bird A.C. Am. J. Ophthalmol. 2004; 137: 504-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thus, in both early and late stages of AMD, the pathologic changes target the RPE. The association of both early and advanced dry AMD with lipofuscin and the progressive loss of RPE in GA has strongly implicated oxidative stress as an important mediator of RPE damage (10Jung T. Bader N. Grune T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2007; 1119: 97-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 11Roth F. Bindewald A. Holz F.G. Graefe's Arch. Clin. Exp.

Sci. 2006; 47: 5495-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The retina provides a permissive environment for generation of reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage. Indeed, retinal tissue samples from patients with GA show widespread evidence of oxidative damage (13Shen J.K. Dong A. Hackett S.F. Bell W.R. Green W.R. Campochiaro P.A. Histol. Histopathol. 2007; 22: 1301-1308PubMed Google Scholar), and several animal models of oxidative retinal injury demonstrate pathologic features of AMD (14Hollyfield J.G. Bonilha V.L. Rayborn M.E.

One of the critical effects of oxidative stress is the induction of cellular senescence (16Herbig U. Ferreira M. Condel L. Carey D. Sedivy J.M. Science. 2006; 311: 1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 17Campisi J. Cell. 2005; 120: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1834) Google Scholar, 18Collado M. Blasco M.A. Serrano M. Cell. 2007; 130: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). First identified as a state of irreversible growth arrest after serial cultivation of cells in vitro, premature senescence has been implicated as a potentially important pathophysiologic mediator of RPE atrophy and loss in GA (4Ambati J. Ambati B.K. Yoo S.H. Ianchulev S. Adamis A.P. Surv. Ophthalmol. 2003; 48: 257-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Markers of senescence, such as telomere shortening and altered gene expression have been identified in RPE cells exposed to advanced glycation end products (AGE), which are found in association with Bruch membrane in AMD (19Honda S. Farboud B. Hjelmeland L.M. Handa J.T. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 2419-2425PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, in vitro studies of the human RPE cell line, ARPE-19, revealed that exposure to oxidants resulted in four well known senescence markers, including hypertrophy, senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-galactosidase) activity, growth arrest and cell cycle arrest in G1 (20Glotin A.L. Debacq-Chainiaux F. Brossas J.Y. Faussat A.M. Treton J. Zubielewicz A. Toussaint O. Mascarelli F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 44: 1348-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Matsunaga H. Handa J.T. Aotaki-Keen A. Sherwood S.W. West M.D. Hjelmeland L.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 197-202PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, accumulation of SA-β-galactosidase-positive senescent RPE cells has been identified in older monkey eyes (22Mishima K. Handa J.T. Aotaki-Keen A. Lutty G.A. Morse L.S. Hjelmeland L.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1590-1593PubMed Google Scholar). Dysregulated growth factor expression in RPE has been implicated as an important mechanism of disease in AMD. Increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor by RPE was identified in advanced wet AMD lesions over 10 years ago and has become a target for effective therapy of this form of the disease (23Lopez P.F. Sippy B.D. Lambert H.M. Thach A.B. Hinton D.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 855-868PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known about the growth factor microenvironment mediating pathologic changes in early and advanced forms of dry AMD. BMP4 (bone morphogenetic protein-4), a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, plays an important role in the morphogenesis of the eye and, in particular, the specification of the RPE (24Muller F. Rohrer H. Vogel-Hopker A. Development (Camb.). 2007; 134: 3483-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 25Furuta Y. Piston D.W. Hogan B.L. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 2203-2212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also an important regulator of cell differentiation and apoptosis in many cell types. In the adult murine retina, BMP4 has been shown to be preferentially expressed in RPE, and in vitro, BMP4 has been shown to be a negative regulator of RPE proliferation. Recent studies in adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma, and myeloma cancer cells have demonstrated that BMP4 can mediate premature cellular senescence in vitro. BMP4 regulates downstream gene expression by signaling through a classic pathway involving phosphorylation of Smad1, -5, and -8 (26Nohe A. Keating E. Knaus P. Petersen N.O. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 27Pardali K. Kowanetz M. Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 204: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) or via a nonclassic TAK1-p38 pathway (28Kendall S.E. Battelli C. Irwin S. Mitchell J.G. Glackin C.A. Verdi J.M. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2001; 236: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that induction of cancer cell senescence by BMP4 may be mediated through simultaneous activation of both pathways (i.e. via Smad pathway to transcriptionally increase p21Cip1/WAF1 expression that further dephosphorylates Rb and via p38 to phosphorylate and stabilize p53) (31Cuadrado A.

In this study, we evaluated the expression of BMP4 in early and late dry AMD and investigated the interplay between BMP4 signaling, oxidative stress, and the induction of RPE senescence. Immunohistochemistry-Donor eyes were obtained from the Lions Eye Bank of Oregon and included 12 normal adult eyes without macular drusen (aged 25-90 years), 10 eyes with pathologic features of early AMD characterized by macular drusen and thickening of Bruch membrane with basal deposits, and three eyes with late AMD characterized by geographic atrophy. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Southern California (Los Angeles, CA) and conducted in compliance with the principles set out in the Declaration of Helsinki for research involving human subjects. Tissue blocks including RPE and choroid were dissected from the macular region, embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Miles Inc., Elkhart, IN), snap-frozen, and stored at -70 °C. Cryostat tissue sections at 8 μm were incubated with primary goat anti-BMP4 polyclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), biotinylated secondary anti-goat antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and streptavidin conjugated with peroxidase (Vector Laboratories) consecutively. The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted with glycerin-gelatin medium. Negative controls included stains in which the primary antibody was omitted, stains in which the primary antibody was preadsorbed with recombinant human BMP4, and use of irrelevant primary antibodies to ensure specificity. Frozen and dissected macular tissues from the same samples of control eyes and eyes with early AMD were also utilized for Western blot to semiquantitatively probe BMP4 protein (see below for Western blot). Cell Lines, Cultures, and Treatments-ARPE-19 cells (ATCC) represent a human RPE cell line that is widely used as a reproducible model of RPE cell biology and function (34Dunn K.C. Aotaki-Keen A.E. Putkey F.R. Hjelmeland L.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). ARPE-19 cells were routinely grown in ARPE medium (F-12/Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 1:1) containing 2 mm glutamine, 30 μg/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) and were passaged or subcultured every 3-4 days (34Dunn K.C. Aotaki-Keen A.E. Putkey F.R. Hjelmeland L.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). The cell treatments were performed on chamber slides, 6-well plates or 96-well plates (BD Falcon), and usually initiated 24 h after cell plating or subculture. In select experiments, early passage primary human RPE were used to confirm experimental results. Primary RPE cells were isolated from fetal human eyes of 18-22 weeks gestation (Advanced Bioscience Resources, Inc., Alameda, CA). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma) with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Irvine Scientific). The culture method used, a standard practice in our laboratory for more than 10 years, regularly yields >95% cytokeratin-positive RPE cells. Cells used were from passages 2-4. Oxidative Stressor Treatment-Ninety-five percent confluent ARPE-19 cells were treated with different concentrations of tert-butylhydroperoxide (tBH; Sigma) at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 μm or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; Sigma) at 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 μm diluted in ARPE medium with 10% fetal bovine serum for 2 h, allowed to recover in stressor-free ARPE medium with 10% fetal bovine serum for 22 h. The procedure was repeated to generate the next treatment cycle, and a complete experiment was composed of either five sequential tBH treatments or two sequential H2O2 treatments. BMP4 Treatment-ARPE-19 cells were treated with 0, 10, 25, or 50 μg/ml recombinant BMP4 protein (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 1 or 24 h in ARPE medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. Blocking or Inhibiting Treatment-ARPE-19 cells were treated with 0.1 μg/ml recombinant Chordin-like 1 protein (R&D Systems) or treated with 10 μm SB203580 (EMD, Gibbstown, NJ) during and after stressor treatments in ARPE medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Creating the ARPE-BMP4 Transgene Cell Line-Human BMP4 cDNA coupled with a 10 amino acid c-myc tag was subcloned into pLenti6/V5-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The pLenti6/V5-TOPO-BMP4 vector with other helper vectors were co-transfected into 293FT cells (Invitrogen) to assemble the lentivirus. The lentiviruses were titrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. BMP4-overexpressing ARPE-19 stable cell lines (ARPE-BMP4) were established by transducing BMP4-expressing lentivirus into ARPE-19 cells and selected with 10 ng/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen). Single cell colonies were picked up and expanded according to the needs of the experiments. Cell Cycle Analysis-Control and treated ARPE-19 cells were harvested, fixed in 10 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol for 24 h, and washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Each sample of 2 × 106 cells was pelleted and resuspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, and 200 μg/ml DNase-free RNase A (Sigma), incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and analyzed using a EPICS XL-MCL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Irvine, CA). BrdU Incorporation Assay-ARPE-19 cells were seeded on chamber slides or 96-well plates and treated with stressors as described above. The ARPE-19 cells were then cultured with 10 μm BrdU (Invitrogen) for 20 h and fixed in ice-cold acid alcohol fixative (70% ethanol and 30% glacial acetic acid, pH 2.0) for 30 min. The BrdU incorporation rates of stressed and control cells were assayed with the BrdU Incorporation Assay Kit (Invitrogen) by in situ BrdU immunostaining, or by cell proliferation ELISA according to the manufacturer’s instructions. SA-β-galactosidase Staining Assay-The stressed and control cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 4 °C and incubated at 37 °C overnight in staining solution (40 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0, 1% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm ferricyanide, 150 mm sodium chloride, and 2 mm magnesium chloride) (35Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Res. 2000; 257: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Senescent cells were identified by the resulting blue reaction product and were counted using phase-contrast microscopy. Real Time RT-PCR-Total RNA was extracted from stressed or control ARPE-19 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA with an RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed using SYBR Green Master Mix and the LightCycler 480 PCR System (Roche Applied Science). Treatments with each stressor with or without inhibitors were repeated three times in independent experiments, and cDNA samples from the above treatments were run in duplicate for PCR amplification. The expression levels of target genes with different treatments were compared with the “housekeeping gene” GAPDH and with corresponding control genes.ΔΔCt=(Cttarget-CttargetGAPDH)/(Ctcontrol-CtcontrolGAPDH) The sequences of primer pairs for amplifying the BMP4 and Apo J genes are listed below. The primer pairs for the BMP4 gene were as follows: forward, 5′-TCC ACA GCA CTG GTC TTG AG-3′; reverse, 5′-GGG ATG TTC TCC AGA TGT TCT T-3′. The primer pairs for Apo J were as follows: forward, 5′-AGA GTG TAA GCC CTG CCT GA-3′; reverse, 5′-CAT CCA GAA GTA GAA GGG CG-3′. The primers for the GAPDH gene were as follows: forward, 5′-CGA CCA CTT TGT CAA GCT CA-3′; reverse, 5′-GGT GGT CCA GGG GTC TTA CT-3′. ELISA-The culture mediums from the stressed or nonstressed ARPE-19 cells were collected and concentrated 50× by centrifuging at 3000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C through Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore). The concentrations of proteins in collected media were then determined by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit for Microtiter Plates to ensure equal loading of total sample proteins in ELISA assays. BMP4 secretion levels were measured using the human BMP4-ELISA kit (RayBiotech, Inc., Norcross, GA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Western Blot Analysis-The stressed and control ARPE-19 cells were homogenized in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Equal amounts of total protein from each sample (20 μg/well) underwent electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels and were electrically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Jeffery, NH). The protein-bearing polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked with nonfat milk (Bio-Rad), incubated with goat anti-BMP4 polyclonal antibody (Abcam), anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (Abcam), anti-p21 monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA), anti-phospho-Rb monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-p38 polyclonal antibody, and rabbit anti-phospho-p38 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) or anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody (Millipore). Membranes were further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). An ECL detection system (GE Healthcare) was used to detect the protein-antibody complex on the membranes. Band intensity and area were measured using Scion software (National Institutes of Health) and normalized to GAPDH. Statistical Analysis-Statistical comparisons were performed using analysis of variance with Tukey’s or Dunnett’s tests for multiple comparisons. All of the tests were two-sided, and the accepted level of significance was p < 0.05. The statistical software package SAS (Version 9.1, SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for all statistical calculations. BMP4 Is Prominently Expressed in the RPE and Bruch's Membrane of AMD Patients-The extent and pattern of expression of BMP4 in the RPE and choroid of macular tissues from control eyes or those from patients with AMD were assessed by immunohistochemistry. All 12 control samples from patients without evidence of AMD lacked immunohistochemical expression of BMP4 (Fig. 1A). The presence of melanin pigment in the control RPE has the potential to obscure low levels of immunoreactivity that cannot be entirely ruled out. In contrast, the RPE and choroidal tissues from 8 of 10 tissue samples from patients with early AMD showed localization of BMP4 protein in the RPE (Fig. 1B) and in the vicinity of Bruch membrane adjacent to hard (Fig. 1C) and soft drusen (Fig. 1D). AMD tissue sections stained with BMP4 antibody preadsorbed with rBMP4 lacked immunoreactivity (Fig. 1C, inset). In all three samples with geographic atrophy, BMP4 expression and localization was prominent in the RPE and thickened Bruch's membrane adjacent to areas of RPE loss and adjacent to the choroidal vasculature (Fig. 1E). Western blot of protein extracts from RPE and choroid in the macular region confirmed the presence of very low levels of BMP4 in control samples and increased levels of BMP4 expression in two patients with early AMD (Fig. 1F). Creating BMP4-overexpressing RPE Stable Cell Lines-In order to simulate the increased level of BMP4 expression in RPE in AMD patients and to facilitate the investigation of putative roles of BMP4 in AMD pathogenesis, we created several stable ARPE-19 cell lines that overexpressed BMP4 protein. A BMP4-expressing lentivirus was first engineered and transduced into ARPE-19 cells. After selection, we tested for BMP4 expression at the transcriptional and translational levels of positive cell clones (ARPE-BMP4). The BMP4 expression levels in different ARPE-BMP4 cell clones were increased from 1.5- to 9-fold compared with control ARPE-19 cells measured by real time RT-PCR (data not shown). We selected the BMP4-ARPE-4 cell line that expressed the highest level of BMP4 (9-fold increase) for further experiments. Evaluation of the culture medium of ARPE-BMP4-4 cell line by Western blot result revealed abundant secretion of BMP4 into the medium (Fig. 2A). Induction of RPE Cell Senescence by BMP4-The cell viability assay showed that the growth of ARPE-BMP4 cells was similar to that of control ARPE-19 cells when cultured in medium with 10% serum (p = 0.74; data not shown). However, when cultured in ARPE medium with 1% serum for 7 days, BMP4-overexpressing cells not only exhibited decreased cell viability but also showed a lower rate of BrdU incorporation when compared with their parent cell line ARPE-19 under the same culture conditions (Fig. 3, D and F). Furthermore, the vast majority of ARPE-BMP4 cells became SA-β-galactosidase-positive (86%), whereas less than 20% of control cells were SA-β-galactosidase-positive (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2, B-D). This result suggests that increased endogenous BMP4 expression could lead to the accelerated RPE cell senescence. Oxidative Stress-arrested RPE Cells at G0/G1 Phase Induced RPE Cell Senescence and Increased BMP4 Expression-In AMD, chronic low levels of oxidative stress are thought to play an important role in disease pathogenesis. To simulate this in vivo situation, we conducted cell stress experiments with low, sublethal doses of chemical oxidants (H2O2 and tBH), using a short duration of exposure to the oxidant at each stress (2 h/stress) and with multiple or repeated exposure steps (2-5 repeats of stressor exposures) under 10% serum condition. Since oxidative stress has cumulative and delayed effects on RPE cells, all treated cells were allowed to stay in 0.1% serum ARPE medium for 72 h after stresses before proceeding to further analytic assays. In preliminary experiments, oxidants were tested at a wide range of concentrations to find optimal sublethal doses. H2O2 was tested from 0 to 1000 μm, whereas tBH was tested from 0 to 250 μm. Concentrations of 1000 μm H2O2 or 200 μm and above tBH led to significant RPE cell death at first stress. RPE cell lethality was increased at concentrations of 500 μm H2O2 and from 100 to 150 μm tBH after two stresses (results not shown). We found that only small numbers (<5%) of cells underwent cell death at the concentrations under 250 μm after two stresses for H2O2 and under 50 μm after five stresses for tBH by a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay (data not shown). However, in contrast, even very low levels of oxidant stress led to marked inhibition of cell proliferation, as measured by BrdU incorporation. As shown in Fig. 3, significant inhibition of cell proliferation was found when cells were incubated with as little as 50 μm H2O2 (p < 0.001) or 10 μm tBH (p < 0.001), and higher oxidant concentrations did not result in any further inhibition. We also performed propidium iodide staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis on oxidatively stressed cells to clarify the effects of the treatment on cell cycle. The results showed that treatment with oxidants increased the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase from 58% (unstressed cells) to 86% (H2O2-stressed cells) (p < 0.01) and 73% (tBH-stressed cells) (p < 0.01) and decreased the percentage of cells in S phase from 16% (unstressed cells) to 0.6% (H2O2-stressed cells) (p < 0.01) and 4.4% (tBH-stressed cells) (p < 0.05), suggesting that sublethal oxidant stress leads to G0/G1 arrest (Fig. 4). Based on these results, H2O2 at 150 μm and tBH at 30 μm were chosen as the optimal oxidative stress doses to treat RPE cells for SA-β-galactosidase staining and other experiments. After treatment with tBH or H2O2, the percentage of SA-β-galactosidase-positive cells increased to 67% (p < 0.001) and 46% (p < 0.001), respectively, when compared with control ARPE cells, which demonstrated less than 5% SA-β-galactosidase positivity (Fig. 5, A, D, G, and J). With the finding that both BMP4 and chemical oxidants can induce RPE cell senescence, we hypothesized that there may be some mechanistic connections between oxidative stress and BMP4 expression. Thus, quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA were used to examine the expression and secretion of BMP4 in the chemical oxidant-treated ARPE-19 cells. The data showed that BMP4 transcription increased about 2.75-fold following 30 μm tBH treatment (p < 0.05) and increased about 2.5-fold following 150 μm H2O2 treatment (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6A); consistent with these findings, BMP4 secretion in oxidant-treated ARPE cells also increased severalfold in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6B). There was no significant difference in BMP4 expression and secretion between these two oxidant treatments (p = 0.7). Increased Expression of Cell Cycle Checkpoint and Senescence Marker Genes in Senescent RPE Cells-To characterize the senescence pathway induced by BMP4 and oxidative stress, we evaluated the expression of cell cycle checkpoint proteins. ARPE-19 cells were treated with different concentrations of recombinant BMP4 (0, 10, 25, and 50 ng/ml) for 24 h in culture medium with 1% serum and treated with different concentrations of oxidative stressors as described above. The Western blot results showed that treatment with oxidative stressors (H2O2 or tBH) resulted in increased protein levels of p21Cip/WAF1 and p53 and decreased protein levels of phosphorylated Rb when compared with those of unstressed ARPE-19 cells as a dose re"
https://openalex.org/W2017194909,"Background Extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), including Avian Pathogenic E. coli (APEC), are very diverse. They cause a complex of diseases in Human, animals, and birds. Even though large plasmids are often associated with the virulence of ExPEC, their characterization is still in its infancy. Methodology/Principal Findings We fully sequenced and analyzed the large plasmid pAPEC-1 (103,275-bp) associated with the APEC strain χ7122, from worldwide serogroup O78∶K80∶H9. A putative virulence region spanning an 80-kb region of pAPEC-1 possesses four iron acquisition systems (iutA iucABCD, sitABCD, iroBCDN, and temperature-sensitive hemagglutinin tsh), a colicin V operon, increasing serum sensitivity iss, ompT, hlyF, and etsABC. Thirty three ORFs in pAPEC-1 are identified as insertion sequences (ISs) that belong to nine families with diverse origins. The full length of the transfer region in pAPEC-1 (11 kb) is shorter compared to the tra region of other sequenced F plasmids; the absence of some tra genes in pAPEC-1 affects its self-transferability, and the conjugative function of the plasmid was effective only in the presence of other plasmids. Two-replicon systems, repFIIA-repFIC and repFIB, and two post-segregational systems, srnB and hok/sok, are also present in the sequence of pAPEC-1. The comparison of the pAPEC-1 sequence with the two available plasmid sequences reveals more gene loss and reorganization than previously appreciated. The presence of pAPEC-1-associated genes is assessed in human ExPEC by PCR. Many patterns of association between genes are found. Conclusions/Significance The pathotype typical of pAPEC-1 was present in some human strains, which indicates a horizontal transfer between strains and the zoonotic risk of APEC strains. ColV plasmids could have common virulence genes that could be acquired by transposition, without sharing genes of plasmid function."
https://openalex.org/W2005166345,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs in several disease states, including renal fibrosis and carcinogenesis. Myofibroblasts produced from EMT of renal tubular cells are responsible for the deposition of extracellular matrix components in a large portion of renal interstitial fibrosis. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) plays an essential role in the EMT of renal tubular cells, but the molecular mechanism governing this process remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that RGC-32 (response gene to complement 32) is critical for TGF-beta-induced EMT of human renal proximal tubular cells (HPTCs). RGC-32 is not normally expressed in the HPTCs. However, TGF-beta stimulation markedly activates RGC-32 while inducing an EMT, as shown by the induction of smooth muscle alpha-actin (alpha-SMA) and extracellular matrix proteins collagen I and fibronectin, as well as the reduction of epithelial marker E-cadherin. TGF-beta function is mediated by several signaling pathways, but RGC-32 expression in HPTCs appears to be mainly regulated by Smad. Functionally, RGC-32 appears to mediate TGF-beta-induced EMT of HPTCs. Blockage of RGC-32 using short hairpin interfering RNA significantly inhibits TGF-beta induction of myofibroblast marker gene alpha-SMA while repressing the expression of E-cadherin. In contrast, overexpression of RGC-32 induces alpha-SMA expression while restoring E-cadherin. RGC-32 also inhibits the expression of another adherens junction protein, N-cadherin, suggesting that RGC-32 alone induces the phenotypic conversion of renal epithelial cells to myofibroblasts. Additional studies show that RGC-32 stimulates the production of extracellular matrix components fibronectin and collagen I. Mechanistically, RGC-32 induces EMT via the activation of other transcription factors such as Snail and Slug. RGC-32 knockdown inhibits the expression of Snail and Slug during TGF-beta-induced EMT. Taken together, our data demonstrate for the first time that RGC-32 plays a critical role in TGF-beta-induced EMT of renal tubular cells."
https://openalex.org/W2096513562,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) is an intracellular messenger that elicits a wide range of spatial and temporal Ca2+ signals, and this signaling versatility is exploited to regulate diverse cellular responses. In this study, we have developed a series of IP3 biosensors that exhibit strong pH stability and varying affinities for IP3, as well as a method for the quantitative measurement of cytosolic concentrations of IP3 ([IP3]i) in single living cells. We applied this method to elucidate IP3 dynamics during agonist-induced Ca2+ oscillations, and we demonstrated cell type-dependent differences in IP3 dynamics, a nonfluctuating rise in [IP3]i and repetitive IP3 spikes during Ca2+ oscillations in COS-7 cells and HSY-EA1 cells, respectively. The size of the IP3 spikes in HSY-EA1 cells varied from 10 to 100 nm, and the [IP3]i spike peak was preceded by a Ca2+ spike peak. These results suggest that repetitive IP3 spikes in HSY-EA1 cells are passive reflections of Ca2+ oscillations, and are unlikely to be essential for driving Ca2+ oscillations. In addition, the interspike periods of Ca2+ oscillations that occurred during the slow rise in [IP3]i were not shortened by the rise in [IP3]i, indicating that IP3-dependent and -independent mechanisms may regulate the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations. The novel method described herein as well as the quantitative information obtained by using this method should provide a valuable and sound basis for future studies on the spatial and temporal regulations of IP3 and Ca2+.

IP3 releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores via IP3 receptors (IP3Rs), and the resulting Ca2+ signals often exhibit complex spatial and temporal organizations, such as Ca2+ oscillations (1Berrige M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4447) Google Scholar). The mechanism responsible for Ca2+ oscillations has been a long-standing question, and a number of experimental approaches and mathematical models have been reported to account for these Ca2+ signals, yet the mechanism responsible remains controversial (2Dupont G. Combettes L. Leybaert L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2007; 261: 193-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). There are two general classes of Ca2+ oscillation models (3Sneyd J. Tsaneva-Atanasova K. Reznikov V. Bai Y. Sanderson M.J. Yule D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In one class, Ca2+ oscillations are generated in the presence of constant cytosolic IP3 concentrations ([IP3]i) (4De Young G.W. Keizer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9895-9899Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar); in the other class, oscillating [IP3]i are required to drive Ca2+ oscillations (5Meyer T. Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 153-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of the former class has been supported experimentally by using nonmetabolizable IP3 analogs (6Wakui M. Potter B.V.L. Petersen O.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and by the observation of repetitive Ca2+ release in permeabilized cells with clamped IP3 concentrations (7Tanimura A. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30904-30908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 8Hajnóczky G. Thomas A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3533-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). On the other hand, oscillatory changes in [IP3]i have been suggested by the observed cyclical translocation of a GFP-tagged pleckstrin homology domain of PLC-δ (GFP-PHD) (9Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 10Nash M.S. Schell M.J. Atkinson P.J. Johnston N.R. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35947-35960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, in other experiments using more specific IP3 biosensors, IP3 was shown to accumulate gradually with little or no fluctuation during Ca2+ oscillations (11Matsu-ura T. Michikawa T. Inoue T. Miyawaki A. Yoshida M. Mikoshiba K. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These discrepant observations may be attributable to differences between various IP3 biosensors and a lack of quantitation. There are two types of IP3 biosensors, GFP-PHD and IP3R-based FRET sensors. GFP-PHD binds to both PIP2 and IP3; thus it has been thought that changes in [IP3]i could be monitored indirectly by the release of membrane-bound GFP-PHD (9Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). IP3R-based FRET biosensors consist of the ligand-binding domain of IP3R and a pair of fluorescent proteins, cyan fluorescent protein and yellow fluorescent protein. Since the successful monitoring of IP3 with LIBRA (12Tanimura A. Nezu A. Morita T. Turner R.J. Tojyo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38095-38098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the first IP3R-based FRET biosensor, several different groups have used similar biosensors for IP3 monitoring (11Matsu-ura T. Michikawa T. Inoue T. Miyawaki A. Yoshida M. Mikoshiba K. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Sato M. Ueda Y. Shibuya M. Umezawa Y. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 4751-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Remus T.P. Zima A.V. Bossuyt J. Bare D.J. Martin J.L. Blatter L.A. Bers D.M. Mignery G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 608-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In principle, quantitative measurements of [IP3]i are not possible with GFP-PHD. In addition, it is recognized that GFP-PHD may be released from the plasma membrane by decreases in available PIP2 (15van der Wal J. Habets R. Várnai P. Balla T. Jalink K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15337-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), which could be attributed to PIP2 hydrolysis or the occupation by other molecules. IP3R-based FRET biosensors offer significant benefits for monitoring IP3 based on their high selectivity for IP3 and ratiometric measurement. In this study, we developed a series of improved IP3 biosensors that exhibit high pH stability and varying IP3 affinities. They also possess higher selectively and afford a larger dynamic range than that of original LIBRA. In combination with these new biosensors, we developed a method for quantitating IP3 dynamics in single living cells, and we applied this method to measure IP3 dynamics during Ca2+ oscillations. Media-Hanks’ balanced salt solution with Hepes (HBSS-H) contained 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.41 mm MgSO4, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4). Intracellular-like medium (ICM) contained 125 mm KCl, 19 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.3), 1 mm EGTA, and 330 μm CaCl2 (for 50 nm free Ca2+). Plasmid Construction-Venus, EYFP with F46L, F64L, M153T, V163A, and S175G, was constructed using site-directed mutagenesis of pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) and a QuikChange® II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers 1-6 were used for mutagenesis (all primers used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1). The sequence of the Venus construct (pVenus-N1) was verified by DNA sequencing. To construct pH-stable LIBRA (LIBRAvIII), the portion of LIBRA containing the membrane-targeting signal, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein, the IP3-binding domain of the rat type 3IP3R (amino acids 1-604), and NheI and EcoRI sites at either end was amplified by PCR using primers 7 and 8 and LIBRA plasmid as the template. This PCR product was then ligated into the NheI and EcoRI sites of pVenus-N1. To construct LIBRA variants with type 1 IP3R (LIBRAvI), the IP3-binding domain of the rat type 1 IP3R (amino acids 1-604) with XhoI sites incorporated at both ends was amplified by PCR using primers 9 and 10 and a rat brain cDNA library as the template. This PCR product was then ligated into the linker region XhoI site in the LIBRAvIII plasmid. In a similar way, we constructed LIBRAvII with the IP3-binding domain of the rat type 2 IP3R (amino acids 1-604) using primers 11 and 12 and a rat parotid cDNA library as the template. The high affinity variant of LIBRAvIII (LIBRAvIII with mutation R440Q; LIBRA-vIIIS) was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of the ligand-binding domain of LIBRAvIII using primers 13 and 14. In a similar way, the high affinity variant of LIBRAvII (LIBRAvIIS) was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of LIBRAvII using primers 15 and 16. Some PCR errors were identified within the IP3-binding domain of LIBRAvI, LIBRAvII, and LIBRAvIIS. Nucleotide sequences of these constructs were corrected by site-directed mutagenesis, and the corrected sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. We previously constructed an IP3-insensitive mutant (K507A) of LIBRA, which we referred to as LIBRA-N. The IP3-insensitive variant of LIBRAv (LIBRAvN) was constructed by cutting the mutated IP3-binding domain of LIBRA-N-plasmid with XhoI and ligating the fragment into LIBRAvIII-plasmid cut with the same enzyme. Cell Culture and Transfection-COS-7 cells, obtained from RIKEN Cell Bank (Tokyo, Japan), were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with low glucose (1000 mg/liter), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 584 mg/liter l-glutamine, 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). HSY-EA1 cell was subcloned from HSY human parotid cell line, a generous gift from Dr. Mitsunobu Sato (Tokushima University, Japan), by a dilution plating technique. HSY-EA1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Eagle’s medium nutrient mixture Ham’s F-12 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, as described previously. These cells were grown in fibronectin-coated experimental chambers consisting of plastic cylinders (7 mm in diameter) glued to round glass coverslips. Measurement of Fluorescence-Cells were washed with HBSS-H and rested for at least 5 min prior to experiments. In some experiments, cells were incubated at room temperature for 1-2 min in HBSS-H containing 2.5 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Dojin Chemicals, Kumamoto, Japan). Permeabilization was performed by applying ICM containing 100 μg/ml (w/v) saponin (ICN, Cleveland, OH) for 1-1.5 min. In some experiments, cells were permeabilized with ICM containing 200 μm β-escin (Sigma). Fluorescence images were captured using a dual wavelength ratio imaging system (Hamamatsu photonics, Shizuoka, Japan) consisting of a C9100-13 EM-CCD camera and W-View optics coupled to a Nikon TE2000 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a Nikon S Fluor 60 oil immersion objective (NA 1.3). Fluorescence of IP3 biosensors was monitored with excitation at 425 nm and dual emission at 480 and 535 nm. Fluorescence of fura-2 was monitored with sequential excitation at 345 and 380 nm and emission at 535 nm. AQUACOSMOS 2.6 software (Hamamatsu Photonics) and ImageJ program were used for image analyses. To minimize the effect of photobleaching on the estimation of [IP3]i, time-dependent decreases in the fluorescence intensities at two emission wavelengths (480 and 535 nm) were monitored for 5-10 min prior to the stimulations, and the photobleaching rates were calculated by fitting the data to linear or exponential equations. Determinations of Kd and Hill Coefficient-Data were analyzed by simulated annealing procedure with GOSA-fit software (BIO-LOG, Toulouse, France) to fit the data to Equation 1, E(&percnt;max)=(EmaxCn)(EC50n+Cn)-1 where C is the IP3 concentration; Emax is the maximal effect (100%), and n is the Hill coefficient. Estimation of [IP3]i-To estimate resting [IP3]i, emission ratios of LIBRAvIIS in intact cells before (Rrest) and after (Rmin) treatment with U73122, and emission ratios in the absence (Rmin′) and presence (Rmax′) of saturating concentrations of IP3 were monitored after permeabilization. [IP3]i can be calculated by Equation 2, [IP3]=Kd(ΔR(ΔRmax-ΔR)-1)1/n where ΔR is Rrest - Rmin; ΔRmax is (Rmax′-Rmin′) Rmin Rmin′-1; Kd is the apparent dissociation constant, and n is the Hill coefficient. Because the variability of resting [IP3]i was reasonably small, we used averaged resting [IP3]i to determine Rmin by Equation 3, Rmin=Rrest-ErestΔRmax where Erest is the E (% max) of resting [IP3]i, which is given by Equation 1. [IP3]i was then calculated using Equation 2. Determinations of Response Rate-LIBRAvIIS-expressing COS-7 cells were permeabilized with saponin, and changes in emission ratio were monitored with the first acquisition protocol (20-50 ms/frame). The response rate for the IP3-dependent increase in ratio was examined by application of 10 μm IP3 to the experimental chamber containing saponin-treated LIBRA-vIIS-expressing cells. To examine the rate of decrease in ratio due to the removal of IP3, permeabilized LIBRAvIIS-expressing cells were initially exposed to 1 μm IP3, and subsequently washed out using IP3-free ICM. In this experimental condition, ∼70% of medium was replaced by a single wash. Using a non-linear least squares method, these data were fitted by the equation derived from a solution of the chemical reaction model, Equation 4, Rt=R0+A((C-1)-1-(Ceγt-1)-1) where R0 is the emission ratio at time 0 (the time when the medium in the chamber was replaced); t is the time after the replacement of the medium; Rt is the emission ratio at time t; and A, C, and γ are arbitrary constants. This equation yields the time for the half-maximal increase or decrease in ratio as t½ = γ-1 ln(2 - C-1). Note that this model is based on the assumption that medium (ICM with or without IP3) within the permeabilized cell is replaced completely at t = 0, whereas the actual time for the replacement is later than at t = 0. It is therefore expected that actual t½ values are at least less than those calculated with this method. See details in the supplemental material. Characterization of Improved IP3 Biosensors-Fig. 1A shows schematic diagrams of IP3 biosensor domain structures. To improve the pH stability of the LIBRA emission ratio (480/535 nm), EYFP was replaced with Venus, a pH-stable yellow fluorescent protein mutant (16Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2183) Google Scholar). The resulting construct (LIBRAvIII) showed strong pH stability in the range of pH 6-8 (Fig. 1B). Next the LIBRAvIII ligand-binding domain was replaced with that of type 1 or type 2 IP3R, to create high affinity IP3 biosensors. These constructs were designated LIBRAvI and LIBRAvII, respectively. It is known that changing Arg to Gln at position 441 (R441Q) increases the affinity of type 1 IP3R (17Yoshikawa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To further increase the affinity, comparable amino acid substitutions in type 2 and type 3 IP3Rs (R440Q) (18Blondel O. Takeda J. Janssen H. Seino S. Bell G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11356-11363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were made in LIBRAvII and LIBRAvIII. We also generated IP3-insensitive LIBRAv (LIBRAvN) by substituting Ala for Lys at position 508 (K508A) in the IP3-binding domain of LIBRAvIII. These biosensors were distributed on the plasma membrane and in vesicular structures (Fig. 1C), and most of the associated fluorescence (>90%) was retained after permeabilization. To quickly characterize these new candidate biosensors, we examined changes in emission ratios in permeabilized cells in response to stepwise increases in IP3 concentration (supplemental Fig. S1). The results of this preliminary characterization indicated that the apparent affinities were LIBRA ≈ LIBRAvIII < LIBRAvIIIS ≈ LIBRAvI ≈ LIBRAvII < LIBRAvIIS, and the extent of maximal changes in the emission ratios of LIBRAvIII, LIBRAvIIIS, LIBRAvII, and LIBRAvIIS were ∼2-fold larger than that of LIBRA. We also noticed that LIBRAvI worked well in HSY-EA1 cells (supplemental Fig. S1G) but not in COS-7 cells (supplemental Fig. S1D). Concentration-response curves of the new IP3 biosensors for IP3, inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (IP2), and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4) are shown in Fig. 1D. The apparent Kd values of LIBRAvIII, LIBRAvI, LIBRAvII, and LIBRAvIIS for IP3 were 491.5, 268.7, 233.6, and 117.2 nm, respectively. A high concentration (10 μm) of IP2 or IP4 induced 20-40% of the maximal response of these biosensors, and the estimated Kd values of LIBRAvIII, LIBRAvII, and LIBRAvIIS for IP2 and IP4 were estimated (supplemental Table S2). LIBRAvII and LIBRAvIIS exhibited greater selectivity than LIBRA, and the selectivity of LIBRAvIIS for IP3 was 300-fold higher than for IP2 and 96-fold higher than for IP4. The characteristics of our IP3 biosensors include the use of Venus, ligand-binding domains of different IP3R isoforms, and a membrane-targeting signal. The superior selectivity of IP3R-based FRET sensors provides a clear advantage over GFP-PHD sensors. In addition, utilizing Venus for a FRET-based biosensor is particularly important to avoid pH-related artifacts (16Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2183) Google Scholar, 19Miyawaki A. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The ligand-binding domain of IP3Rs is composed of two functional domains, the amino-terminal suppressor domain and the carboxyl-terminal IP3-binding core domain (17Yoshikawa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Unlike other IP3R-based FRET sensors (11Matsu-ura T. Michikawa T. Inoue T. Miyawaki A. Yoshida M. Mikoshiba K. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Sato M. Ueda Y. Shibuya M. Umezawa Y. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 4751-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), LIBRA and LIBRAv variants contain both IP3 suppressor and core domains. Because the molecular properties of IP3R isoforms have been studied extensively, it is relatively easy to construct biosensors with appropriate levels of affinity. In addition, it has been reported that structural differences in the suppressor domains contribute to functional diversity in ligand sensitivity among IP3R isoforms (20Iwai M. Michikawa T. Bosanac I. Ikura M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12755-12764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), assuming that the ligand-binding properties of the LIBRAv series reflect this feature of IP3R isoforms. We previously reported a method using LIBRA for determining IP3R ligands (21Nezu A. Tanimura A. Morita T. Shitara A. Tojyo Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 1274-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and we identified novel ligands of IP3Rs from newly synthesized cyclopentane derivatives (22Zhang L. Huang W. Tanimura A. Morita T. Harihar S. DeWald D.B. Prestwich G.D. Chem. Med. Chem. 2007; 2: 1281-1289Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This method could be extended easily for identifying subtype-specific ligands of IP3Rs by using a series of new LIBRAv variants. Imaging of IP3-dependent Response of LIBRAvIIS-Emission ratios within an individual cell, whether intact or permeabilized, were uneven, whereas the magnitudes of the maximal change in ratio in response to 10 μm IP3 were reasonably consistent (supplemental Fig. S2). Therefore, we visualized IP3-dependent changes in the fluorescence emission ratio with normalized ratio images (Fig. 2A), where each ratio image was divided by an image before the application of IP3. The normalized LIBRAvIIS emission ratio increased homogeneously except for the area including intracellular vesicles in cell 2 (Fig. 2B). It was noticed that abundant accumulation of IP3 sensors on intracellular vesicles tended to decrease the extent of IP3-dependent changes in the emission ratio. We then applied this procedure to visualize the ATP-induced increase in LIBRAvIIS emission ratio and subsequent decrease because of the removal of ATP in intact COS-7 cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Response rates of IP3 biosensors were examined by high speed monitoring of IP3-dependent changes in the emission ratio of LIBRAvIIS in permeabilized cells and a least squares curve-fitting technique. The emission ratio increased to the half-maximal level in ∼100 ms following the application of 10 μm IP3. The estimated time for the half-maximal increase (t½on) and decrease (t½off) in the emission ratio was 162 and 169 ms, respectively (supplemental Fig. S3). These analyses indicate that the response rate of LIBRAvIIS is sufficiently rapid to reflect responses that occur ∼100 ms or longer. However, the spatial resolution and signal to noise ratio necessary to detect subcellular difference in the high speed monitoring of IP3 were not achieved in our experimental system. Inclusion of a membrane-targeting signal provided a rapid means for examining biosensors expressed in permeabilized cells (supplemental Fig. S1) and enabled calibration of FRET signals in single cells (Fig. 3). However, nonuniform distributions of biosensors caused a subcellular variability in the ratio. This variability was overcome by using normalized emission ratio images, although this method is not suitable for measurements in motile cells. Further improvement of IP3 biosensor dynamic ranges is required for the high speed monitoring of subcellular IP3 responses. Methods for Quantitative Measurement of [IP3]i-Emission ratios of LIBRAvIII and LIBRAvIIS in intact cells increased upon the application of 10 μm ATP, and returned to basal levels after the addition of 5 μm U73122 (Fig. 3). These reagents did not change the emission ratio of LIBRAvN (data not shown). To obtain the maximal changes in emission ratio (ΔRmax) in each individual cell, cells were permeabilized and exposed to IP3 following the completion of measurements in intact cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Biosensor-expressing cells and LIBRAvN-expressing cells showed decreases in their fluorescence ratios upon permeabilization. These changes in fluorescence are thought to be due to effects on the fluorescent proteins rather than to effects on the IP3-binding domain, and thus they are unlikely to interfere with IP3-dependent changes in emission ratios. In Fig. 3, C and D, changes in emission ratios are quantitatively shown as % of maximal change in ratio (% max). The difference in % max values of ATP-induced changes in emission ratios between LIBRAvIII and LIBRAvIIS is thought to reflect the difference in affinities of these IP3 sensors. We further examined resting [IP3]i by treating unstimulated cells with U73122. The LIBRAvIII emission ratio did not change with U73122 treatment (Fig. 3E), whereas the LIBRAvIIS ratio decreased slowly to a new steady state (Fig. 3F). These results indicate that the emission ratio of LIBRAvIIS reflects the resting [IP3]i, and U73122 decreases [IP3]i to levels below the detectable range of LIBRAvIIS. Consistent with this interpretation, Sato et al. (13Sato M. Ueda Y. Shibuya M. Umezawa Y. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 4751-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) reported that U73122-induced decreases in the emission ratio of intact cells were observed using a high affinity IP3 biosensor. Based on this idea, we used the U73122-induced decrease in emission ratios, Kd, and Hill coefficient of LIBRAvIIS (shown in Fig. 1D) to estimate the resting [IP3]i in COS-7 and HSY-EA1 cells. U73122-induced decrease in emission ratio of LIBRAvIIS in COS-7 and HSY-EA1 cells was 13.67 ± 0.96 (mean ± S.E., n = 60) and 16.03 ± 1.53 (n = 19), respectively. The estimated resting [IP3]i in COS-7 and HSY-EA1 cells was 15.09 ± 1.38 and 18.16 ± 2.49 nm, respectively. Resting [IP3]i values allowed us to accurately calculate agonist-induced changes in [IP3]i. In calculations for LIBRAvIIS, omitting adjustment for resting [IP3]i caused a noticeable underestimation in concentration (Fig. 4D), whereas the effects of adjusting calculations for resting [IP3]i was limited for LIBRAvIII (Fig. 4C). In addition, the impact of basal noise of the LIBRAvIIS fluorescence on the basal level of calculated [IP3]i was negligible (Fig. 4D, arrowhead), indicating that LIBRAvIIS is suitable for monitoring small increases in [IP3]i up to 200 nm. Changes in the emission ratio of LIBRAvIII corresponded well over a broad range of [IP3]i, up to ∼400 nm, whereas base-line value fluctuations near the resting [IP3]i produced a noticeable difference in the estimated [IP3]i (Fig. 4C, arrowheads). These results indicate that LIBRAvIII is convenient for monitoring broad ranges of [IP3]i. In this study, [IP3]i was estimated under the following assumptions: 1) that the properties of IP3 biosensors in permeabilized cells are comparable with those in intact cells, and 2) that U73122 reduces [IP3]i below the detectable level of the biosensors. To examine possible effects of cytosolic proteins on biosensor response, we compared IP3-induced changes in the ratios of LIBRAvIIS in β-escin-permeabilized cells and in saponin-permeabilized cells and found comparable IP3-induced responses (supplemental Fig. S4). β-Escin-permeabilized cells have been used to examine the functions of cytosolic proteins, 3A. Tanimura, unpublished observations. whereas cytosolic proteins are lost in saponin-permeabilized cells (7Tanimura A. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30904-30908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Tanimura A. Nezu A. Morita T. Hashimoto N. Tojyo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29054-29062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of endogenous cytosolic proteins on the IP3-induced response of biosensors could be ruled out. In addition, our previous study indicates that IP3-dependent changes in the ratio of LIBRA are not altered by Ca2+ or ATP, and that the effect of pH on fluorescent proteins does not alter the IP3-dependent changes in the fluorescence of LIBRA (12Tanimura A. Nezu A. Morita T. Turner R.J. Tojyo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38095-38098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although these experiments do not exclude possible effects of other small endogenous molecules, it is reasonable to assume at this stage that IP3-dependent changes in the ratios of these types of biosensors in permeabilized cells are comparable with those in intact cells. We also examined the effects of U73122 on ATP-induced Ca2+ responses, and we found that the pretreatment of COS-7 cells with 5 μm U73122 completely blocked the rise in [Ca2+]i obtained by 3 μm ATP, and strongly decreased responses obtained with 10 μm ATP (data not shown). It is therefore thought that U73122 pretreatment is sufficient to block the low level of PLC activity in unstimulated cells. Indeed, we have used this method to estimate the [IP3]i required to elicit Ca2+ responses (see below), and these values are reasonably close to the threshold concentration of photoreleased [IP3]i (60 nm) that triggers Ca2+ spikes in Xenopus oocytes (24Parker I.

Low temperature EPR of Pleurotus eryngii versatile peroxidase (VP) revealed, for the first time in a fungal peroxidase, the presence of a tryptophanyl radical in both the two-electron (VPI) and the one-electron (VPII) activated forms of the enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to substitute this tryptophan (Trp-164) by tyrosine and histidine residues.

EPR revealed the formation of tyrosyl radicals in both VPI and VPII of the W164Y variant. However, no protein radical was detected in the W164H variant, whose VPI spectrum indicated a porphyrin radical identical to that of the inactive W164S variant. Stopped-flow spectrophotometry showed that the W164Y mutation reduced 10-fold the apparent second-order rate constant for VPI reduction (k2app) by veratryl alcohol (VA), when compared with over 50-fold reduction in W164S, revealing some catalytic activity of the tyrosine radical. Its first-order rate constant (k2) was more affected than the dissociation constant (KD2). Moreover, VPII reduction by VA was impaired by the above mutations, revealing that the Trp-164 radical was involved in catalysis by both VPI and VPII. The low first-order rate constant (k3) values were similar for the W164Y, W164H, and W164S variants, indicating that the tyrosyl radical in VPII was not able to oxidize VA (in contrast with that observed for VPI).

Lignin degradation, a key step for carbon recycling in land ecosystems and a central issue for industrial use of lignocellulosic biomass (e.g. in paper pulp manufacture and bioethanol production), is initiated in nature by 1-electron oxidation of the benzenic rings of lignin by specialized high redox potential fungal peroxidases (1Kirk T.K.

The existence of a tryptophan radical in a peroxidase (in this case neighbor to heme) has been reported in cytochrome c peroxidase, where it participates in LRET substrate oxidation (14Beratan D.N.

Direct detection of a protein radical in a ligninolytic peroxidase (corresponding to the above mentioned catalytic tryptophan) was reported in Pleurotus eryngii and Bjerkandera adusta VP by low temperature EPR of its Compound I (16Pogni R.

Reson. 2007; 31: 509-526Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), although indirect evidence on a homologous LiP radical had been previously obtained (19Blodig W. Smith A.T. Winterhalter K. Piontek K.

Based on these results, an extension of the basic catalytic cycle of VP (22Ruiz-Duenñas F.J. Martínez M.J. Martínez A.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) was proposed by including two forms (A and B) of both Compound I (VPI) and Compound II (VPII) (10Pérez-Boada M. Ruiz-Duenñas F.J. Pogni R. Basosi R. Choinowski T. Martínez M.J. Piontek K. Martínez A.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), although no direct evidence on the existence of VPII form B (characterized by the presence of a protein radical) was reported. Several amino acids, including tyrosine and histidine in addition to tryptophan, can form stable free radicals playing a role in enzyme catalysis as intermediates in electron or hydrogen atom transfer (23Stubbe J. Der Donk W.A. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 705-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). Two putative LRET pathways initiated at exposed histidine residues were first proposed in LiP (24Schoemaker H.E. Lundell T.K. Floris R. Glumoff T. Winterhalter K.H. Piontek K. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1994; 2: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25Johjima T. Itoh H. Kabuto M. Tokimura F. Nakagawa T. Wariishi H. Tanaka H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1989-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The homologous residues are conserved in VP isoenzymes (22Ruiz-Duenñas F.J. Martínez M.J. Martínez A.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 26Camarero S. Sarkar S. Ruiz-Duenñas F.J. Martínez M.J. Martínez A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10324-10330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). However, neither of them is catalytically relevant, as shown by site-directed mutagenesis, and only the LRET pathway initiated at the conserved tryptophan residue (VP Trp-164 and LiP Trp-171) seems to be operative (8Doyle W.A. Blodig W. Veitch N.C. Piontek K. Smith A.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15097-15105Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 10Pérez-Boada M. Ruiz-Duenñas F.J. Pogni R. Basosi R. Choinowski T.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3498-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Concerning possible tyrosine radicals, it is noteworthy that ligninolytic peroxidases are completely depleted of tyrosine residues in their sequences, whereas tyrosine residues are present in peroxidases from soil basidiomycetes such as the Coprinopsis cinerea peroxidase (6Martínez A.T. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2002; 30: 425-444Crossref Scopus (341) Google Scholar). This is most probably due to the need to maintain the enzymes active in the strongly oxidative environment characterizing wood lignin degradation, where tyrosine residues could be oxidized. A single exception exists, among the more than 50 ligninolytic basidiomycete peroxidases cloned up to date, corresponding to a Trametes cervina LiP that includes in its structure a catalytic tyrosine involved in aromatic substrate oxidation (located at a different position than LiP Trp-171 and VP Trp-164) (28Miki Y. Tanaka H. Nakamura M. Wariishi H. J. Fac. Agr. Kyushu. Univ. 2006; 51: 99-104Google Scholar). However, formation of tyrosyl radicals has been suggested in other heme and non-heme proteins (29Ivancich A. Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Un S. Obinger C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14093-14102Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 30Aubert C. Mathis P. Eker A.P. Brettel K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kondo R. Phytochemistry. 2008; 69: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the present study, the presence of catalytic tryptophan radicals in both P. eryngii VPI and VPII is investigated, and the operation of alternative amino acid residues substituting the catalytic Trp-164 of VP is explored. With this purpose, the resting state and peroxide-activated forms of the native enzyme and the variants obtained by Trp-164 site-directed mutagenesis were analyzed by EPR to detect the presence and nature of radicals. Moreover, their steady-state and transient state kinetics were investigated to determine whether the VPI and VPII radicals were catalytically operative. Finally, the crystal structure of a mutated variant forming a new protein radical was solved to investigate changes in the molecular structure. Chemicals-Dithiothreitol, ferrocyanide, hemin, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, manganese sulfate, oxidized glutathione, potassium hydrogen phthalate, Reactive Black 5 (RB5), sodium tartrate, veratryl alcohol (VA), and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, with the exception of hydrogen peroxide and urea, which were from Merck. Horseradish peroxidase type VI (RZ = 3) was from Sigma-Aldrich. Site-directed Mutagenesis-The cDNA encoding the mature isoenzyme VPL (allelic variant VPL2; GenBank™ AF007222) (22Ruiz-Duenñas F.J.

Escherichia coli DH5α was selected for plasmid propagation. The plasmid pFLAG1-VPL2 was used as template for site-directed mutagenesis by PCR using the QuikChange™ kit from Stratagene. The following primers were used to produce the different variants (direct constructions, with the changed triplets in bold and mutations underlined, are shown): (i) W164Y, 5′-CCCGTCGAGGTTGTTTACCTCCTGGCTTCGC-3′; (ii) W164H, 5′-CCCGTCGAGGTTGTTCACCTCCTGGCTTCGCACTCC-3′; (iii) W164S, 5′-CCCGTCGAGGTTGTTTCGCTCCTGGCTTCGC-3′; (iv) R257A/A260F double variant, 5′-CGAAGATTCAGAACGCTTTCGCTTTTACCATGTCGAAGATGGCTCTTCTTGGC-3′. The W164Y/R257A/A260F triple variant was obtained using the plasmid pFLAG1-VPL2 (R257A/A260F) as template and direct and reverse oligonucleotides W164Y as primers. The mutated genes were sequenced using an ABI 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems) to ensure that only the desired mutations occurred. PCR reactions (50 μl final volume) were carried out in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences GeneAmp PCR system 240 using 10 ng of template DNA, 500 μm each dNTP, 125 ng of direct and reverse primers, 2.5 units of PfuTurbo polymerase (Stratagene), and the manufacturer's buffer. Reaction conditions were as follows: (i) a “hot start” at 95 °C for 1 min; (ii) 18 cycles at 95 °C for 50 s, 55 °C for 50 s, and 68 °C for 10 min; and (iii) a final cycle at 68 °C for 10 min. Enzyme Production-Native (non-mutated) recombinant VP protein and five site-directed variants were obtained by E. coli W3110 expression after transformation with the corresponding plasmids (32Pérez-Boada M.

Cells were grown for 3 h in Terrific Broth, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and grown for a further 4 h. The apoenzyme accumulated in inclusion bodies was recovered using 8 m urea. Subsequent in vitro folding was performed using 0.16 m urea, 5 mm Ca2+, 20 μm hemin, 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg/ml protein concentration, at pH 9.5 (32Pérez-Boada M.

Active enzyme was purified by Resource-Q chromatography using a 0-0.3 m NaCl gradient (2 ml/min, 20 min) in 10 mm sodium tartrate (pH 5.5) containing 1 mm CaCl2. Electronic absorption spectra were recorded at 25 °C using a Shimadzu UV-160 spectrophotometer. The concentrations of native VP and variants were calculated from the absorption at 407 nm using an 150 mm-1 · cm-1 extinction coefficient (22Ruiz-Duenñas F.J. Martínez M.J. Martínez A.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). EPR Measurements-Solutions of native VP and its directed variants (final concentration ∼275 μm) were prepared in 0.1 m phthalate buffer (pH 4.5). The W164Y variant and native VP were treated with 8 eq of H2O2, whereas the W164H and W164S variants were treated with 1 eq of H2O2, and the reactions were stopped by rapid immersion of the EPR tube in liquid N2. For VPII analysis, the enzyme solutions were treated with equimolecular amounts of H2O2 and ferrocyanide. CW-X-band (9.4 GHz) EPR measurements were carried out with a Bruker E500 Elexsys series using the Bruker ER 4122 SHQE cavity and an Oxford helium continuous flow cryostat (ESR900). Spin quantification was performed by double integration of the experimental EPR radical signal when compared with the iron signal. EPR simulations were performed using the X-Sophe package (Bruker). Dimerization Analysis-Native VP and the mutated variants were incubated with 8 eq of H2O2 overnight at 4 °C in 10 mm sodium tartrate, pH 5.0. SDS-PAGE of the treated samples was performed in 12% polyacrylamide gels, including low molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad). Amino acid composition was determined in a Biochrom 20 autoanalyzer (Amersham Biosciences) after hydrolysis of 7 μg of the treated proteins with 6 m HCl at 110 °C under vacuum for 20 h. Crystallization and Structure Determination-Crystals of the W164Y variant were obtained by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. The protein (10 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium tartrate, pH 5.0) was mixed 1:1 with a solution containing 100 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 5.0), 4% 1,3-propanediol, and 1.4 m ammonium sulfate. Crystals appeared after 14 days at 25 °C and were “frozen” in the crystallization medium plus 25% glycerol. A complete data set was collected at the beamline ID14.2 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France). Data reduction was done using MOSFLM and SCALA, from the CCP4 package (33Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19761) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using MOLREP (34Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl.

Consecutive cycles of refinement and manual rebuilding were done using REFMAC (35Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson D.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The statistics of data collection, processing, and refinement are shown in Table 1. The structure was validated using MolProbity (37Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X.

Open table in a new tab Steady-state Enzyme Kinetics-Oxidation of VA to veratraldehyde (ϵ310 9300M-1 · cm-1) was estimated at pH 3.0, and that of RB5 (ϵ59830000 m-1 · cm-1) at pH 3.5. Oxidation of Mn2+ was estimated by the formation of Mn3+-tartrate complex (ϵ238 6500 m-1 · cm-1) using 0.1 m sodium tartrate (pH 5). All enzymatic activities were measured as initial velocities taking linear increments (decreases in the case of RB5) at 25 °C in the presence of 0.1 mm H2O2. Mean values and standard errors for apparent affinity constant (Michaelis-Menten constant, Km) and maximal enzyme turnover (catalytic constant, kcat) were obtained by non-linear least-squares fitting to the Michaelis-Menten model. Fitting of these constants to the equation v = (kcat/Km)[S]/(1+[S]/Km) yielded the efficiency or selectivity constant (kcat/Km) with its standard error. Transient State Enzyme Kinetics-Transient state kinetic constants were measured at 25 °C (or 10 °C when required) using a stopped-flow equipment (Bio-Logic) including a three-syringe module (SFM300) synchronized with a diode array detector (J&M Analytik AG) and Bio-Kine software. VPI formation was investigated by mixing the resting enzyme with increasing concentrations of H2O2 in 100 mm sodium tartrate (pH 3) under pseudo-first-order conditions and followed at 397 nm (the isosbestic point of VPI and VPII). To investigate VPII formation, VPI was first prepared by mixing 4 μm resting enzyme with 1 eq of H2O2 in 10 mm sodium tartrate (pH 5). After 0.6 s of aging, an excess of substrate in 100 mm (final concentration) sodium tartrate, pH 3 (VA) or pH 3.5 (RB5) was added, and VPII formation was followed at 416 nm (the isosbestic point of VPII and resting enzyme). The first step to investigate VPII reduction was production and reduction of VPI by premixing (6 s) a solution of 4 μm enzyme and 4 μm ferrocyanide with 1 eq of H2O2 in 10 mm sodium tartrate (pH 5). VPII reduction was followed at 406 nm (the Soret maximum of resting enzyme) after mixing with different concentrations of VA or RB5 in the same buffers used for VPI reduction. In all cases, the final concentration of enzyme was 1 μm. All kinetic traces exhibited single exponential character from which pseudo-first-order rate constants were calculated. Five VP variants were obtained by PCR mutagenesis and, together with native VP, investigated by EPR, crystallographic, and steady and transient state kinetic techniques. The W164Y and W164H variants included tyrosine or histidine residues potentially forming protein radicals in substitution of the catalytic Trp-164, whereas W164S was used as a control lacking activity on high redox potential substrates. The W164Y/R257A/A260F triple variant combined the W164Y mutation with two changes in the Trp-164 environment that have been previously shown (38Ruiz-Duenñas F.J. Morales M. Mate M.J. Romero A. Martínez M.J. Smith A.T. Martínez A.T. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1685-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and increased the capability of VPI and VPII for oxidizing VA (the R257A/A260F variant was analyzed for comparison). The resting state and VPI and VPII electronic absorption spectra (the two latter obtained under stopped-flow conditions) of the different variants and native VP showed that the mutations had not caused any substantial changes in the heme environment. Fig. 1A (top) shows the low temperature (20 K) 9-GHz EPR spectrum of the resting state of the W164Y variant. This spectrum maintained the same characteristics of the native VP resting state (Fig. 2A) with the Fe(III) in the high spin state (g⊥ = 6 and g∥ = 2.0). The resting state of the W164H and W164S variants (not shown) also had the same characteristics, confirming the information provided by the electronic absorption spectra.FIGURE 2Low temperature EPR spectrum of VP resting state (A) when compared with those recorded after the addition of equimolecular amounts of H2O2 and ferrocyanide to native VP (B) and its W164Y variant (C). All spectra were recorded at ν 9.39 GHz; modulation amplitude, 1 mT; microwave power, 2 milliwatts; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; and temperature, 20 K.

In its EPR spectrum (Fig. 1A, bottom), the appearance of a radical-like signal was evident, with the concomitant disappearance of the iron signal. The new radical signal had a giso = 2.0049(1Kirk T.K. Farrell R.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 465-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar) with a radical yield of 0.07 spin/heme. Saturation measurements (see supplemental Fig. 1) showed that the radical was weakly coupled with a paramagnetic ion, suggesting the same situation described for Trp-164 radical in native VP (16Pogni R.

Fig. 1B (top and center) shows an expansion of the well resolved EPR signal of the W164Y variant radical reported in Fig. 1A (simulated and experimental spectra) when compared with the expansion of the EPR signal assigned to a Trp-164 neutral radical of native enzyme VPI (Fig. 1B, bottom). These signals were dominated by the hyperfine couplings of the β-methylene protons, β1 and β2 at the side-chain Cβ (see supplemental Fig. 2), one of them being much larger than the other. The EPR spectrum of the W164Y radical was characterized by a doublet with well resolved sub-splittings on both components. This radical signal showed a higher giso value (2.0049) than that of native VPI (giso = 2.0027), indicative of the formation of an organic radical including oxygen or sulfur (40Bleifuss G. Kolberg M. Potsch S. Hofbauer W. Bittl R. Lubitz W. Graslund A. Lassmann G. Lendzian F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15362-15368Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The hyperfine couplings constants obtained for the β-methylene protons of the W164Y variant radical (Fig. 1) are in fair agreement with those previously reported for the native enzyme Trp-164 radical (17Pogni R. Baratto M.C. Teutloff C. Giansanti S. Ruiz-Duenñas F.J. Choinowski T. Piontek K. Martínez A.T. Lendzian F. Basosi R. J. Biol.

Robertson R.E. J. Phys. Chem. A. 1957; 611018Crossref Google Scholar), we could deduce that the phenolic side chain had the same orientation in the mutated variant like that indolic ring in the native protein VPI radical. Finally, the g tensor components (gx = 2.0087(2), gy = 2.0041(2), and gz = 2.0019(2)) were consistent with a tyrosyl radical (40Bleifuss G. Kolberg M. Potsch S. Hofbauer W. Bittl R. Lubitz W.

In Fig. 1C, the EPR spectra of the W164H (dotted line) and W164S (continuous line) variants after the addition of 1 eq of H2O2 (resulting in VPI formation) are superimposed. Both VPI EPR spectra were very similar in shape, characterized by the same giso value (2.00(1)) (with a peak to peak amplitude equal to 0.22 mT), and resembled the [Fe(IV) = O Por+·] intermediate spectrum reported in other heme proteins (45Ivancich A.

https://openalex.org/W2027926703,"Introduction Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is the leading cause of cancer in Uganda and occurs in people with and without HIV. Human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) replication is important both in transmission of HHV-8 and progression to KS. We characterized the sites and frequency of HHV-8 detection in Ugandans with and without HIV and KS. Methods Participants were enrolled into one of four groups on the basis of HIV and KS status (HIV negative/KS negative, HIV positive/KS negative, HIV negative/KS positive, and HIV positive/KS positive). Participants collected oral swabs daily and clinicians collected oral swabs, anogenital swabs, and plasma samples weekly over 4 weeks. HHV-8 DNA at each site was quantified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results 78 participants collected a total of 2063 orals swabs and 358 plasma samples. Of these, 428 (21%) oral swabs and 96 (27%) plasma samples had detectable HHV-8 DNA. HHV-8 was detected more frequently in both the oropharynx of persons with KS (24 (57%) of 42 persons with KS vs. 8 (22%) of 36 persons without, p = 0.002) and the peripheral blood (30 (71%) of 42 persons with KS vs. 8 (22%) of 36 persons without, p<0.001). In a multivariate model, HHV-8 viremia was more frequent among men (IRR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.7–6.2, p<0.001), persons with KS (IRR = 3.9, 95% CI = 1.7–9.0, p = 0.001) and persons with HIV infection (IRR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.0–2.7, p = 0.03). Importantly, oral HHV-8 detection predicted the subsequent HHV-8 viremia. HHV-8 viremia was significantly more common when HHV-8 DNA was detected from the oropharynx during the week prior than when oral HHV-8 was not detected (RR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.8–5.9 p<0.001). Genital HHV-8 detection was rare (9 (3%) of 272 swabs). Conclusions HHV-8 detection is frequent in the oropharynx and peripheral blood of Ugandans with endemic and epidemic KS. Replication at these sites is highly correlated, and viremia is increased in men and those with HIV. The high incidence of HHV-8 replication at multiple anatomic sites may be an important factor leading to and sustaining the high prevalence of KS in Uganda."
https://openalex.org/W1996074689,"Cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contain three NAD kinases; namely, cytosolic Utr1p, cytosolic Yef1p, and mitochondrial Pos5p. Previously, the NADH kinase reaction catalyzed by Pos5p, rather than the NAD kinase reaction followed by the NADP(+)-dependent dehydrogenase reaction, had been regarded as a critical source of mitochondrial NADPH, which plays vital roles in various mitochondrial functions. This study demonstrates that the mitochondrial NADH kinase reaction is dispensable as a source of mitochondrial NADPH and emphasizes the importance of the NAD kinase reaction, followed by the mitochondrial NADP(+)-dependent dehydrogenase reaction. Of the potential dehydrogenases (malic enzyme, Mae1p; isocitrate dehydrogenase, Idp1p; and acetaldehyde dehydrogenases, Ald4/5p), evidence is presented that acetaldehyde dehydrogenases, and in particular Ald4p, play a prominent role in generating mitochondrial NADPH in the absence of the NADH kinase reaction. The physiological significance of the mitochondrial NADH kinase reaction in the absence of Ald4p is also demonstrated. In addition, Pos5p is confirmed to have a considerably higher NADH kinase activity than NAD kinase activity. Taking these results together, it is proposed that there are two sources of mitochondrial NADPH in yeast: one is the mitochondrial Pos5p-NADH kinase reaction and the other is the mitochondrial Pos5p-NAD kinase reaction followed by the mitochondrial NADP(+)-dependent acetaldehyde dehydrogenase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2051271691,"Activity of the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) is modulated by Na(+) self-inhibition, an allosteric down-regulation of channel open probability by extracellular Na(+). We searched for determinants of Na(+) self-inhibition by analyzing changes in this inhibitory response resulting from specific mutations within the extracellular domains of mouse ENaC subunits. Mutations at gammaMet(438) altered the Na(+) self-inhibition response in a substitution-specific manner. Fourteen substitutions (Ala, Arg, Asp, Cys, Gln, Glu, His, Ile, Phe, Pro, Ser, Thr, Tyr, and Val) significantly suppressed Na(+) self-inhibition, whereas three mutations (Asn, Gly, and Leu) moderately enhanced the inhibition. Met to Lys mutation did not alter Na(+) self-inhibition. Mutations at the homologous site in the alpha subunit (G481A, G481C, and G481M) dramatically increased the magnitude and speed of Na(+) self-inhibition. Mutations at the homologous betaAla(422) resulted in minimal or no change in Na(+) self-inhibition. Low, high, and intermediate open probabilities were observed in oocytes expressing alphaG481Mbetagamma, alphabetagammaM438V, and alphaG481M/betagammaM438V, respectively. This pair of residues map to thealpha5 helix in the extracellular thumb domain in the chicken acid sensing ion channel 1 structure. Both residues likely reside near the channel surface because both alphaG481Cbetagamma and alphabetagammaM438C channels were inhibited by an externally applied and membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl reagent. Our results demonstrate that alphaGly(481) and gammaMet(438) are functional determinants of Na(+) self-inhibition and of ENaC gating and suggest that the thumb domain contributes to the channel gating machinery."

Although the flavin cofactor is expected to be integrally involved in catalysis, its exact role remains controversial.

Based on the active-site structures of the reduced FMN-substrate-enzyme ternary complexes, which are in the active state, and on the data from site-directed mutagenesis at highly conserved charged or polar amino acid residues around the active site, we demonstrate that only reduced FMN, not amino acid residues, can catalyze proton addition/elimination required for the isomerase reaction. This discovery is the first evidence for this long suspected, but previously unobserved, role of flavins just as a general acid-base catalyst without playing any redox roles, and thereby expands the known functions of these versatile coenzymes.

This discovery is the first evidence for this long suspected, but previously unobserved, role of flavins just as a general acid-base catalyst without playing any redox roles, and thereby expands the known functions of these versatile coenzymes. Flavins are generally regarded as redox coenzymes because their primary function in redox-catalyzing flavoenzymes is donation and/or acceptance of electrons (1Massey V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 283-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As summarized in a review article (2Bornemann S. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the redox activities of flavins also take part in the flavoenzymes that catalyze reactions with no net redox change. Most of these enzymes are thought to have redox-based mechanisms, whereas flavins have only structural or stabilizing roles in a few exceptions. Recently, however, a report on UDP-galactopyranose mutase unexpectedly showed that flavin can act as a nucleophilic catalyst (3Soltero-Higgin M. Carlson E.E. Gruber T.D. Kiessling L.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 4Miller S.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 497-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In UDP-galactopyranose mutase, a sugar carbon undergoes nucleophilic attack by the N-5 nitrogen of reduced FMN, concomitantly with the dissociation of UDP, forming an adduct intermediate. In this reaction, the flavin cofactor has no redox function because it is continuously in the reduced state. Type 2 isopentenyl-diphosphate isomerase (IDI) 4The abbreviations used are: IDI, isopentenyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl-diphosphate isomerase; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; eIPP, 3,4-epoxy-3-methylbutyl diphosphate; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate. is the flavoenzyme that catalyzes the interconversion between isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) that occurs with no net change in redox status (5Kaneda K. Kuzuyama T. Takagi M. Hayakawa Y. Seto H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 932-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Both compounds are fundamental units for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, a diverse family of >50,000 metabolites (6Christianson D.W. Science. 2007; 316: 60-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Type 2 IDI requires FMN, NAD(P)H, and Mg2+ to be active; however, NAD(P)H is used only for the reduction of FMN and can be replaced with Na2S2O4 (7Hemmi H. Ikeda Y. Yamashita S. Nakayama T. Nishino T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 8Kittleman W. Thibodeaux C.J. Liu Y.N. Zhang H. Liu H.W.

The observation that reduced FMN is required for type 2 IDI activity allowed for development of various plausible reaction mechanisms, including redox-based mechanisms. Based on the traditional interpretation of the results from the experiments that used cofactor analogues such as 5-deaza-FMN, radical-mediated mechanisms were proposed at first, negating both the hydride transfer mechanism and the merely structural role of FMN (7Hemmi H. Ikeda Y. Yamashita S. Nakayama T. Nishino T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 8Kittleman W. Thibodeaux C.J. Liu Y.N. Zhang H. Liu H.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8401-8413Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the study using “radical clock” substrate analogues (10Johnston J.B. Walker J.R. Rothman S.C. Poulter C.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 7740-7741Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) disproved the radical mechanisms, suggesting that the inactivation of type 2 IDI reconstituted with 5-deaza-FMN should be reconsidered with a modern interpretation. Moreover, the measurement of deuterium kinetic isotope effects (11Thibodeaux C.J. Mansoorabadi S.O. Kittleman W. Chang W.C. Liu H.W. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 2547-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) strongly supported the non-redox protonation-deprotonation mechanism, which is also utilized by type 1 IDI (12Ramos-Valdivia A.C. van der Heijden R. Verpoorte R. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1997; 14: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Type 1 enzymes, which are present in nearly all eukaryotes and some bacteria, have no sequential homology with type 2 IDI, which is found in almost all archaea and many bacteria (13Kuzuyama T. Seto H. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In type 1 IDI, isomerization proceeds via formation of a 3° carbocation intermediate, and conserved cysteine and glutamate residues act as the general acid or base to mediate (1,3)-antarafacial proton addition/elimination. Hence, there are two possible roles of reduced FMN in type 2 IDI: 1) reduced FMN itself acts as the general acid-base catalyst; and 2) protonation and deprotonation are catalyzed by amino acid residues, and reduced FMN stabilizes the intermediate. The N-5 nitrogen of FMN must be integrally involved in both mechanisms. Although the pKa values of reduced flavins are within the physiological pH range (14Miura R. Chem. Rec. 2001; 1: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Macheroux P. Ghisla S. Sanner C. Ruterjans H. Muller F. BMC Biochem. 2005; 6: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), there has been no definitive report on the flavoenzymes in which flavin only acts as a general acid-base catalyst without having any redox function. Recent studies of type 2 IDI using substrate analogues such as 3,4-epoxy-3-methylbutyl diphosphate (eIPP), which form adducts with FMN, suggest the possibility that FMN N-5 may act as a general acid or base (10Johnston J.B. Walker J.R. Rothman S.C. Poulter C.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 7740-7741Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Hoshino T. Tamegai H. Kakinuma K. Eguchi T. Bioorg. Med.

Soc. 2008; 130: 4906-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Based on what is known about the mechanism of UDP-galactopyranose mutase, this theory seems plausible. However, the absence of crystal structures of enzyme-substrate complexes inhibits complete understanding of the role of reduced FMN in type 2 IDI reactions. Here, we report the crystal structures of the substrate-enzyme complexes of type 2 IDI isolated from a thermoacidphilic archaeon, Sulfolobus shibatae, in both the oxidized and reduced state. Combined with results from mutagenic studies that targeted the highly conserved residues, the structural data showed that reduced FMN acts as the general acid-base catalyst. Enzyme Purification-The plasmid for the expression of (His)6-tagged S. shibatae IDI, pET-idi (18Yamashita S. Hemmi H. Ikeda Y. Nakayama T. Nishino T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), was introduced into the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain. The transformant was cultivated in L medium containing 50 mg/liter of ampicillin until cells reached the early stationary phase. The recombinant enzyme was purified with heat treatment at 55 °C for 30 min and a HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) as described previously (18Yamashita S. Hemmi H. Ikeda Y. Nakayama T. Nishino T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For crystallization, the enzyme was loaded on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), containing 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.15 m NaCl. Crystallization-IDI crystals were grown at 20 °C using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method with a reservoir solution containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 m sodium citrate, and 30% (v/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400. The native crystals were used in the analysis of the substrate-free structure. Crystals for the analysis of the reduced substrate-free structure were obtained by soaking the native crystals in the reservoir solution containing 32% (v/v) PEG 400 and 10 mm NADH. Substrate-complex structures were obtained from the crystals that had been soaked for 1 h in the reservoir solution containing 32% (v/v) PEG 400 and 5 mm IPP or 10 mm DMAPP. Crystals for the analysis of the reduced substrate-complex structures were obtained by the addition of an appropriate amount of Na2S2O4 to the soaking solution containing the substrate. X-ray Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement-All data sets were collected on beamline BL-5A at the photon factory (KEK, Tsukuba, Japan). Complete data sets were collected over contiguous rotation ranges at a given wavelength before proceeding to the next wavelength, and were processed and scaled with HKL2000 (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38605) Google Scholar). Data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1. All data sets belonged to space group P43212 with four molecules per asymmetric unit. The IDI structure was solved with Os-derivative crystals using the multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction method. Os-derivative crystals were obtained by soaking the native crystals for 12 h in the reservoir solution containing 1 mm OsCl3. Initial phases were determined using the SHARP program (20de la Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Phase improvement by density modification was performed using the program, DM (21Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar).

During subsequent refinement, the Os-derivative data set was replaced with native data sets. NCS restraints were applied to 4 subunits through refinement. FMN, IPP, and DMAPP models were fitted into the substrate-binding sites based on the difference electron density map (supplemental Fig. S1).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics Numbers in parentheses are for the highest shell.Crystal typeFreeIDIFreeIDIredIPP-IDIIPP-IDIredDMAPP-IDIDMAPP-IDIredOs-derivativePeakEdgeRemoteData collection and processing statisticsSpace groupP43212P43212P43212P43212P43212P43212P43212Unit cell dimension (Å)a = b (Å)100.745101.203100.444100.359101.071100.879100.770c (Å)336.829336.501333.914334.607333.430334.864334.320α = β = γ (°)90,00090,00090,00090,00090,00090,00090,000Wavelength (Å)1.00001.00001.00001.00001.00001.00001.139801.140221.04000Resolution (Å)50.00-1.99 (2.06-1.99)50.00-2.30 (2.38-2.30)50.0-2.39 (2.48-2.39)50.0-2.64 (2.74-2.64)50.0-3.00 (3.11-3.00)50.0-2.90 (3.00-2.90)50.00-3.0 (3.11-3.00)50.00-3.1 (3.21-3.10)50.00-3.1 (3.21-3.10)Measured1,001,560699,031469,313427,040155,709467,679363,518209,356253,878I/σI24.6 (8.3)22.7 (2.5)23.6 (3.2)18.9 (2.2)13.2 (2.1)22.1 (2.5)23.3 (5.5)20.8 (6.4)23.7 (6.2)Redundancy8.4 (8.1)9.0 (5.7)6.8 (5.0)8.8 (4.4)4.5 (3.7)11.9 (6.1)5.5 (4.9)6.5 (5.6)7.8 (6.7)Completeness (%)99.4 (96.9)98.7 (89.1)99.3 (96.8)93.6 (68.2)95.9 (90.9)99.6 (96.9)100.0 (100.0)98.8 (98.3)99.9 (100.0)RmergeaRmerge = 100Σ|I – 〈I〉|/ΣI, where I is the observed intensity and 〈I〉 is the average intensity of multiple observations of symmetry-related reflections (%)8.7 (26.8)8.4 (39.0)8.0 (37.7)9.0 (33.8)9.2 (38.8)9.0 (41.2)6.4 (25.4)8.3 (23.8)7.2 (26.6)Phasing statisticsNo. of sites12Figure of meritAcentric0.479Centric0.316Refinement statisticsResolution37.50-2.0049.03-2.3049.69-2.4049.63-2.6445.22-3.0048.85-2.90Protein atoms10,99611,15211,23211,23211,23211,232Ligand atoms124124184184184184Water molecule728581578404175172Rwork/Rfree (%)18.5/22.218.0/21.618.7/21.918.2/22.218.4/21.419.2/21.3Root mean square deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.0140.0180.0130.0140.0120.012Bond angles (°)1.4621.7001.4891.5411.4721.572a Rmerge = 100Σ|I – 〈I〉|/ΣI, where I is the observed intensity and 〈I〉 is the average intensity of multiple observations of symmetry-related reflections Open table in a new tab Mutagenesis-Alanine-substitution mutations were introduced into pET-idi using a QuikChange Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and oligonucleotide primers indicated in supplemental Table S1. The IDI assay for the mutants was performed as previously described (7Hemmi H. Ikeda Y. Yamashita S. Nakayama T. Nishino T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). CD Spectroscopy-CD spectra of the enzymes were analyzed using a J-720WI spectropolarimeter (JASCO, Japan). NADH Oxidase Assay-NADH oxidase activity of wild-type and mutated S. shibatae IDIs were measured using previously described methods (7Hemmi H. Ikeda Y. Yamashita S. Nakayama T. Nishino T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Preparation of Apoenzymes-Preparation of apo forms of wild-type and mutated S. shibatae IDIs was performed using overnight dialysis under the conditions described previously (7Hemmi H. Ikeda Y. Yamashita S. Nakayama T. Nishino T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). If IDI activity remained after the first dialysis step, the enzyme was dialyzed again for 48 h. After complete loss of activity, the dialysis buffer was changed to 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), and dialysis was continued overnight. Complete removal of FMN also was confirmed by the disappearance of the peak at ∼450 nm from the absorption spectrum of the enzyme solution measured with a UV-2450 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Measurement of Dissociation Constants for IPP and FMN-The Kd for IPP was determined from the change in fluorescence intensity resulting from intrinsic tryptophan residues, which results from binding of the substrate to the enzyme. The fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths were 295 and 350 nm, respectively. Five hundred μl of purified enzyme solution containing 25 μmol of sodium succinate buffer (pH 6.0), 0.5 nmol of the purified enzyme, 5 nmol of FMN, and 1.25 μmol of MgCl2 was titrated with 10 mm IPP, and the fluorescence intensity measured at each point of titration with a F-4500 fluorometer (Shimadzu, Japan). The fluorescence intensity (F) and the concentration of IPP ([L]) were corrected for the increase in the volume of the solution. The data were plotted (F versus [L]) and fitted using the equation below. The hypothetical final fluorescence intensity is the value to which F would converge if unlimited amounts of IPP were added to the reaction. Kd and ΔF, the difference between the initial fluorescence intensity (Fi) and the hypothetical final fluorescence intensity, were set as variable parameters. Kaleidagraph (Synergy software) was utilized for data plotting and equation fitting.F=Fi+ΔF[L]/([L]+Kd)Eq. 1 To measure the Kd for FMN, apoenzyme that had been prepared as described above was used. Five hundred μl of enzyme solution containing 25 μmol of sodium succinate buffer (pH 6.0) and 0.5 nmol of the apoenzyme was titrated with 100 μm FMN. Data were corrected and fitted to Equation 1, substituting the FMN concentration for [L]. Overall Structure-We obtained six distinct types of S. shibatae type 2 IDI crystals: substrate-free IDI (termed “FreeIDI”), complexes with IPP (“IPP-IDI”) and DMAPP (“DMAPP-IDI”), the substrate-free reduced form (“FreeIDIred”), the IPP-complex in the reduced state (“IPP-IDIred”), and the DMAPP-complex in the reduced state (“DMAPP-IDIred”). The structure of FreeIDI was solved using the multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction method with the Os-derivative, and then the structures of each type of crystal were refined. The refinement statistics and model quality parameters are listed in Table 1. Of 368 residues, the following were not visible in the electron density and were probably disordered: 12 residues (N-terminal, 8 residues; C-terminal, 1 residue; and residues Gly69 to Arg71) in the FreeIDI form; 7 residues (N-terminal, 6 residues; and C-terminal, 1 residue) in the FreeIDIred form; 4 residues (N-terminal, 2 residues; and C-terminal, 2 residues) in the substrate-complex forms. In all crystal types, the asymmetric unit contains four monomers that are related by a non-crystallographic 4-fold rotation, which is regarded as the tetrameric state of S. shibatae IDI in solution (18Yamashita S. Hemmi H. Ikeda Y. Nakayama T. Nishino T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, each monomer contains a regular triose-phosphate isomerase barrel structure (or α8β8 barrel: α3, α5, α7, α9, α10, α13-α14, α15, α16, β3, β4, β5, β6, β7, β8, β9, β10), like previously reported substrate-free structures of bacterial type 2 IDIs (24Steinbacher S. Kaiser J. Gerhardt S. Eisenreich W. Huber R. Bacher A. Rohdich F. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25de Ruyck J. Rothman S.C. Poulter C.D. Wouters J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A notable structural aspect is that α1, α8, α11, and α12 are located on the top face of the triose-phosphate isomerase barrel, forming a portion of the active site (Fig. 1C). Large inter-subunit surfaces (3380 Å2 per monomer) were observed among the four monomers (Fig. 1D). The subunit interaction consists of β7, α8, α12, α16, α18, and the loop regions, β1-α1, α12-α13, α8-α9, and β7-α10, the structures of which are stabilized by the interaction. α8 and the loop region α8–α9 also contribute to formation of the active site; therefore, tetramer formation is required for construction of the active site. Binding of the Substrate and Cofactor-The S. shibatae IDI tetramer contains four active sites, which are located inside the triose-phosphate isomerase barrel structure. The electron densities of FMN, and of IPP/DMAPP in the substrate-complex structures, were found in all substrate-binding sites in a tetramer (supplemental Fig. S1). However, apparent electron density for NADH was not observed in FreeIDIred; although the structure was determined based on analysis of IDI crystals that had been soaked in NADH solution. In all structures, well defined FMN electron densities were identified in a pocket surrounded by β-strands (β3, β4, β5, β6, β7, β8, β9, and β10) that composed the triose-phosphate isomerase barrel structure and by α-helices (α1 and α11). In the FreeIDI structure, the FMN molecule interacts with Thr65, Gly66, Thr68, Ser96, Asn125, His155, Lys193, Ser218, Thr223, Trp225, Gly275, Arg277, Ala296, and Leu297 of S. shibatae IDI (Fig. 2A). Among these residues, Gly275, Ala296, and Leu297, which interact with the phosphate moiety of FMN via backbone amides, are located at the C-terminal end of β-strands 9 and 10. These common phosphate-binding sites have been termed the “standard phosphate binding motif” (26Nagano N. Orengo C.A. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 741-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The substrate-binding sites are located on the top of the triose-phosphate isomerase barrel and surrounded by helices (α1, α4, and α8), loops (β4-α4, α8-α9), and the isoalloxazine ring of FMN in the four complex structures. The substrates, IPP and DMAPP, directly interact with the side chains of Arg7, Lys8, Ser96, Arg98, His155, Gln160, Trp225 and the isoalloxazine ring of FMN in nearly the same manner via hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (Fig. 2C). Additionally, a Mg2+ ion, which is supported by His155, via a water molecule, and by Glu161, is also coordinated to the diphosphate moiety of the substrates. The ionic and hydrogen bonds that form among the diphosphate group, Mg2+ ion, water molecules, and surrounding amino acid resides, seem to contribute significantly to substrate binding. The tight binding confronts the isopentenyl or dimethylallyl plane of the substrate with the si-face of the isoalloxazine ring of FMN. Differences in Active Site Structures-Although the overall structures of the six forms of S. shibatae IDI are similar, significant differences exist among the structures of the active site. One difference accompanies substrate binding: the active site is open to bulk solvents in the FreeIDI and FreeIDIred structures, whereas it is closed in the other structures that are complexed with substrates (supplemental Fig. S2). This difference arises from changes in the orientation of α4 and loop region α8–α9. In addition to the interactions that result from substrate and Mg2+ binding, hydrogen bond formation between Arg98 (on α4) and Glu168 (on loop α8–α9) would lead the conformational change that closes the aperture of the active site. Another structural difference is due to the redox states of the enzyme. In the FreeIDI structure, the backbone nitrogen atom of Thr68 is close enough to form hydrogen bonds with FMN N-5. Meanwhile, in the FreeIDIred structure, the main chain nitrogen of Thr68 is positioned in the opposite direction, and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Met67 is within hydrogen-bond formation distance from FMN N-5 (Figs. 2B and 3A). Conformational changes in the residues, which interact with FMN N-5, which were derived from differences in redox states were also observed in several flavoproteins, such as flavodoxin from Clostridium beijerinckii (27Ludwig M.L. Pattridge K.A. Metzger A.L. Dixon M.M. Eren M. Feng Y. Swenson R.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1259-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, in all substrate-complex structures, the arrangements of the residues that were coordinated with FMN N-5 were similar to that in the FreeIDIred structure, even in the oxidized state (data not shown). It should be noted that isomerase reaction would proceed in the reduced substrate-complexes. Thus the substrates bound in the IPP-IDIred and DMAPP-IDIred structures are considered to be a mixture of IPP, DMAPP, and probably a reaction intermediate. However, both substrate conformation and interaction with surrounding residues in the substrate-complex structures were nearly identical, in both the oxidized and reduced states (Fig. 3B). Moreover, distortion of the isoalloxazine ring was observed in FreeIDIred, whereas the ring was more planar in FreeIDI (Fig. S3). In structural studies of flavoenzymes, reduction of flavin sometimes results in distortion (28Lennon B.W. Williams Jr., C.H. Ludwig M.L. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2366-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, the conformational change in FMN and the loss of yellow color of the crystals (supplemental Fig. S4) are considered proof that FMN is in the reduced state in S. shibatae type 2 IDI. The reduction-induced conformational change in the isoalloxazine ring was not as obvious in the substrate-complex structures with lower resolution. When reduced, however, both the isoalloxazine ring of FMN and the isopentenyl or dimethylallyl plane of the substrates also twisted slightly, bringing them closer together (Fig. 3B). Alanine-scanning Mutagenesis-Concurrent with the structural investigations, mutagenic studies of type 2 IDI were also performed. Based on the previously reported structures of type 2 IDIs from Bacillus subtilis (Protein Data Band codes 1P0N and 1P0K (24Steinbacher S. Kaiser J. Gerhardt S. Eisenreich W. Huber R. Bacher A. Rohdich F. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)) and Thermus thermophilus (1VCF, 1VCG, and 3DH7 (29de Ruyck J. Pouyez J. Rothman S.C. Poulter D. Wouters J. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 9051-9053Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)), 15 charged or polar amino acid residues, which are highly conserved among known type 2 IDIs and likely to be in the active site, were selected for mutagenesis (Fig. 4A). Each amino acid residue was replaced with alanine to determine the function of its side chain. In the solved structures of S. shibatae type 2 IDI, all of the mutated residues appeared to be in proximity of FMN and/or the substrates (Fig. 4B). Wild-type IDI and all mutants, except for K193A, were purified as holoenzymes that tightly bound FMN. These results indicate that the mutations did not affect the proper folding of the enzyme. Only K193A was obtained as an apoenzyme that bound FMN with very low affinity; however, the CD spectra of K193A and wild-type IDI were nearly identical, indicating that the global structure of the mutant had not been altered by the mutation (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4C (see also supplemental Table S2), IDI activity was significantly reduced in most mutants compared with the wild-type enzyme. In particular, R7A, K8A, N157A, Q160A, E161A, and K193A showed significant loss of activity (less than 1% of wild-type enzyme activity), suggesting that the mutated residues are important for the enzyme reaction. In contrast, all mutants, except for K193A, retained more than ∼20% NADH oxidase activity of wild-type S. shibatae IDI (supplemental Table S2), which is a subfunction of the enzyme observed in the absence of the substrate (18Yamashita S. Hemmi H. Ikeda Y. Nakayama T. Nishino T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This result indicates that the significant inactivation of some enzymes for IDI reaction is not derived from the deficiency in the reduction of FMN by NADH. The inactivity of K193A is due to its inability to bind FMN. We also examined the Kd values of each enzyme for FMN and IPP by measuring the change in tryptophan fluorescence intensity through titration (supplemental Table S2). None of the mutations, except for K193A, affected the parameters, indicating that, other than Lys193, the mutated amino acids were not critically involved in binding of either FMN or IPP. Candidates for General Acid-Base Catalysts-In the substrate-enzyme complexes, IPP and DMAPP are bound very closely on the si-face of the FMN isoalloxazine ring, which means that rotation of their C-2–C-3 bonds during reaction is unlikely. During isomerization between IPP and DMAPP, proton exchange occurs selectively at C-2 and C-4 of IPP (the latter corresponds to E-methyl of DMAPP) (30Barkley S.J. Desai S.B. Poulter C.D. Org. Lett. 2004; 6: 5019-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 31Laupitz R. Grawert T. Rieder C. Zepeck F. Bacher A. Arigoni D. Rohdich F. Eisenreich W. Chem. Biodivers. 2004; 1: 1367-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, deprotonation and protonation at C-2 are reportedly pro-R stereospecific (31Laupitz R. Grawert T. Rieder C. Zepeck F. Bacher A. Arigoni D. Rohdich F. Eisenreich W. Chem. Biodivers. 2004; 1: 1367-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 32Kao C.L. Kittleman W. Zhang H. Seto H. Liu H.W. Org. Lett. 2005; 7: 5677-5680Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These facts and the coordination of carbon atoms of the substrates justify the assignment shown in Fig. 3B. Thus, possible proton donors to the C-4 of IPP, and proton acceptors from the E-methyl carbon of DMAPP in the active site were explored. Based on the active-state IPP-IDIred structure, the N-5 nitrogen of FMN, which is located 3.60 ± 0.10 Å from the C4 carbo"
https://openalex.org/W2048984862,"The post-transcriptional processing of pre-mRNAs by RNA editing contributes significantly to the complexity of the mammalian transcriptome. RNA editing by site-selective A-to-I modification also regulates protein function through recoding of genomically specified sequences. The adenosine deaminase ADAR2 is the main enzyme responsible for recoding editing and loss of ADAR2 function in mice leads to a phenotype of epilepsy and premature death. Although A-to-I RNA editing is known to be subject to developmental and cell-type specific regulation, there is little knowledge regarding the mechanisms that regulate RNA editing in vivo. Therefore, the characterization of ADAR expression and identification of alternative ADAR variants is an important prerequisite for understanding the mechanisms for regulation of RNA editing and the causes for deregulation in disease.Here we present evidence for a new ADAR2 splice variant that extends the open reading frame of ADAR2 by 49 amino acids through the utilization of an exon located 18 kilobases upstream of the previously annotated first coding exon and driven by a candidate alternative promoter. Interestingly, the 49 amino acid extension harbors a sequence motif that is closely related to the R-domain of ADAR3 where it has been shown to function as a basic, single-stranded RNA binding domain. Quantitative expression analysis shows that expression of the novel ADAR2 splice variant is tissue specific being highest in the cerebellum.The strong sequence conservation of the ADAR2 R-domain between human, mouse and rat ADAR2 genes suggests a conserved function for this isoform of the RNA editing enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2044982606,"Asymmetric dimethylation of arginine residues is a common posttranslational modification of proteins carried out by type I protein arginine methyltransferases, including PRMT1 and -3. We report that the consecutive transfer of two methyl groups to a single arginine side chain by PRMT1 and -3 occurs in a distributive manner, i.e. with intermittent release of the monomethylated intermediate. The oligomeric state of PRMTs together with the clustering of methylated arginine residues in most proteins carrying this type of modification suggests that multiple methyl transfers to a single polypeptide chain might proceed in a processive manner by cooperation of multiple active sites. However, three different types of experiments provide evidence that the reaction is distributive even with substrates containing multiple methyl-accepting arginines, including one with 13 such residues. PRMT1 also does not prefer substrates already containing one or more singly or doubly methylated arginine residues. Even though the reaction is distributive, the efficiency of methylation of one particular protein strongly depends on the number of methyl-accepting arginine residues it contains.

In contrast, type I PRMTs convert the intermediate to asymmetric dimethylarginine, the more common modification. In mammals, this class comprises PRMT1, -3, -4, -6, and -8 (2Pahlich S. Zakaryan R.P. Gehring H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 1890-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 10Krause C.D. Yang Z.-H. Kim Y.-S. Lee J.-H. Cook J.R. Pestka S. Pharmacol. Ther. 2007; 113: 50-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Due to sequence similarities, PRMT2 is regarded as a type I enzyme as well, but catalytic activity has not been demonstrated so far. Apart from PRMT8, which has been found in brain tissue and HEK 293 (T) cells only (2Pahlich S. Zakaryan R.P. Gehring H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 1890-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), type I PRMTs seem to be more or less ubiquitously expressed. Arginine methylation is a group transfer reaction in which the methyl group is transferred from S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to the guanidine moiety of the arginine side chain, presumably via an Sn2 reaction (15Smith B.C. Denu J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1789: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). A reaction mechanism has been postulated based on structural evidence and mutagenesis experiments. The catalytic core, highly conserved between PRMTs, is formed by two domains. The N-terminal domain corresponds to the Rossman fold and binds the methyl donor, as seen in co-crystals with the product S-adenosylhomocysteine (16Troffer-Charlier N. Cura V. Hassenboehler P. Moras D. Cavarelli J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4391-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 17Yue W.W. Hassler M. Roe S.M. Thompson-Vale V. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4402-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Zhang X. Cheng X. Structure. 2003; 11: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 19Zhang X. Zhou L. Cheng X. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). S-Adenosylmethionine is anchored in the active site by interactions with conserved glutamate and arginine residues. The C-terminal catalytic domain is a β-barrel structure. The methyl-accepting arginine side chain is bound between this domain and the S-adenosylmethionine binding domain, its guanidinium group being positioned via hydrogen bonds with two invariant glutamate residues; their mutation disrupts catalytic activity (18Zhang X. Cheng X. Structure. 2003; 11: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Conceivably, these hydrogen bonds also fix the positive partial charge to one terminal nitrogen of the guanidine moiety and create a negative charge at the other, which is then ready to attack the methylsulfonium group of S-adenosylmethionine. Proton elimination may occur via a histidine-aspartate proton relay system (19Zhang X. Zhou L. Cheng X. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The PRMTs contain acidic grooves on the surface surrounding the active sites. These grooves seem to be able to bind arginine residues in the neighborhood of the one occupying the active site, as suggested by a co-crystal with a substrate peptide containing three methyl-accepting arginine residues. However, details of these interactions remain unknown, apparently due to the presence of several binding modes in the crystallized complex (18Zhang X. Cheng X. Structure. 2003; 11: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). As outlined above, monomethyl arginine is an intermediate in the reaction; addition of two methyl groups appears obligatory. Thus, the reaction might proceed either in a distributive fashion, with intermittent release of the monomethylated intermediate, or processively, with both methyl transfers occurring in a single binding event. Structural studies of PRMT4 showed that a binding pocket for the protein substrate is fully formed only upon binding of S-adenosylmethionine. This strongly suggests a sequential ternary complex mechanism whereby the methyl donor binds first, followed by the methyl acceptor. After catalysis, release of the monomethylated arginine product seems necessary to allow dissociation of the second product, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, and a second round of methyl transfer. This would correspond to a strictly distributive mechanism (17Yue W.W. Hassler M. Roe S.M. Thompson-Vale V. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4402-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Indeed, steady-state kinetic experiments with PRMT6 supported the sequential order mechanism as described and, thus, distributive behavior (20Lakowski T.M. Frankel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10015-10025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Earlier suggestions of processive methylation by PRMT6 can likely be explained by the preference of the enzyme for rebinding to the monomethylated product of the first methyl transfer reaction (20Lakowski T.M. Frankel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10015-10025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast, steady-state kinetic analysis of PRMT1 suggested a rapid equilibrium random mechanism (21Obianyo O. Osborne T.C. Thompson P.R. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 10420-10427Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because this mechanism would allow exchange of the product S-adenosylhomocysteine for a new molecule of S-adenosylmethionine without peptide release, it is compatible with a processive mechanism. In fact, a partially processive mechanism has been suggested for PRMT1 (22Osborne T.C. Obianyo O. Zhang X. Cheng X. Thompson P.R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13370-13381Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The studies cited so far investigated the methylation of peptide substrates containing a single methyl-accepting arginine residue. However, proteins modified by PRMTs typically contain multiple methylated arginine residues. Also, PRMTs form ring-like dimers, which can assemble into higher oligomers in solution. The active sites are located at the inner surface of the ring (16Troffer-Charlier N. Cura V. Hassenboehler P. Moras D. Cavarelli J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4391-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 17Yue W.W. Hassler M. Roe S.M. Thompson-Vale V. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4402-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Zhang X. Cheng X. Structure. 2003; 11: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 19Zhang X.

Biol. 2000; 7: 1165-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Dimer formation is essential for catalytic activity (18Zhang X. Cheng X. Structure. 2003; 11: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 23Weiss V.H. McBride A.E. Soriano M.A. Filman D.J. Silver P.A. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1165-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Thus, even if a single PRMT active site acting on a single arginine side chain could only work distributively, one can readily imagine how the action of two or more active sites in a PRMT oligomer on multiple arginine residues in a single substrate protein might lead to processive behavior. It is even conceivable that the ring-shaped dimer might act as a sort of clamp sliding over the protein domains containing the methyl-accepting arginines; these domains are assumed to be unstructured. In the present study, we have investigated the asymmetric dimethylation of arginines by PRMT1 and -3. Substrates included a number of synthetic peptides as well as the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein (PABPN1). PABPN1 is involved in mRNA polyadenylation, stimulating and regulating poly(A)-polymerase (24Bienroth S. Keller W. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 25Kerwitz Y. Kühn U. Lilie H. Knoth A. Scheuermann T. Friedrich H. Schwarz E. Wahle E.

Bovine PABPN1 contains 13 asymmetrically dimethylated arginines in its C-terminal domain of 49 amino acids, almost all of them clustered in RXR sequences (29Smith J.J. Rücknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Tang J. Nemeth A. Linder M. Herschman H.R. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13229-13234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The methylated domain is very likely to be unstructured and is a substrate for PRMTs 1, 3, and 6. Among these three, PRMT1 is not only the most abundant but also the most efficient one in modifying PABPN1 (30Fronz K. Otto S. Kölbel K. Kühn U. Friedrich H. Schierhorn A. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20408-20420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The biological function of arginine methylation in PABPN1 remains unknown. Binding to poly(A) and stimulation of poly(A) polymerase are not affected in vitro (31Kühn U. Nemeth A. Meyer S. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16916-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The aggregation of the PABPN1 orthologue from Schizosaccharomyces pombe was found to be reduced by arginine methylation (32Perreault A. Lemieux C. Bachand F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7552-7562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) but such an effect was not confirmed for bovine PABPN1 (30Fronz K. Otto S. Kölbel K. Kühn U. Friedrich H.

Our results show that two consecutive methyl transfers to a single arginine side chain as well as multiple methylation events in a single peptide or protein are catalyzed in a distributive manner by PRMT1 and -3.

Protein concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopy using the theoretical absorption coefficients or by SDS-PAGE with subsequent Coomassie staining and bovine serum albumin as standard or by both methods. Synthetic Peptides-Peptides were synthesized and analyzed as described (30Fronz K. Otto S. Kölbel K. Kühn U. Friedrich H. Schierhorn A. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wahle E. J. Biol.

The lyophilized peptides were dissolved in water. Their concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopy using the theoretical absorption coefficients. Methylation Assays-Conditions were as published (30Fronz K. Otto S. Kölbel K. Kühn U. Friedrich H. Schierhorn A. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wahle E. J. Biol.

Reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl and stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer and immediate freezing. If not stated otherwise, the initial concentration of [14C]S-adenosylmethionine (GE Healthcare) was 85 μm, and the PRMT1 concentration was ∼12 nm. For steady-state kinetic analysis, substrate proteins and peptides were titrated until saturation was achieved. The initial reaction rates were plotted directly against the substrate concentration and fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation. For MS analyses, conditions were as above except the total volume per assay was 210 μl, from which 20-μl samples were taken at the times indicated. The concentration of S-adenosylmethionine was typically 20 μm and that of PRMT1 varied between 30 and 300 nm, as indicated in the figure legends. Peptide concentrations were 36 μm (RXR-1 or -2, and RGG) and 50.9 μm (K2). The assays with K2 contained 200 μm S-adenosylmethionine. Assays with PRMT3 contained 0.21 μm enzyme, 200 μm S-adenosylmethionine, and 36 μm RGG, RXR-1, or RXR-2 peptide. For experiments with PABPN1, bovine serum albumin and Nonidet P-40 were omitted from the reaction buffer. These assays contained 12 μm PABPN1, 200 μm S-adenosylmethionine, and 0.3 μm PRMT1 or PRMT3. Reactions were started by the addition of S-adenosylmethionine (Sigma). After different time intervals 20-μl aliquots were taken, the reaction was stopped by addition of the methylation inhibitor sinefungin (Sigma) to a final concentration of 0.6 mm, the samples were frozen and later processed for mass spectrometry as described below. Similar assays containing the same concentration of [14C]S-adenosylmethionine and peptides were performed in parallel. These samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described above. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry-Peptide samples were desalted and concentrated by C18 ZipTip® (Millipore); peptides were eluted with 75% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water. 0.5 μl of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid was spotted on a ground steel MALDI plate. 0.5 μl of the peptide sample was directly spotted into the matrix spot, which was then blow-dried. Mass spectra were acquired on an Ultraflex III MALDI-TOFTOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik) equipped with a Smartbeam laser. Peptide spectra were recorded in the positive ionization and reflector mode. The spectra were calibrated using an external calibration with Peptide Calibration Standard II (Bruker Daltonik). Data acquisition and data evaluation were carried out with FlexControl and FlexAnalysis software (Bruker Daltonik). The peaks representing the peptides carrying different numbers of methyl groups were integrated with the software IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics). ESI Mass Spectrometry-PABPN1 was methylated as described above and digested with endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche Diagnostics). Proteolysis products were purified by reversed phase chromatography on an UltiMate Nano-HPLC system (LC Packings) coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap XL hybrid mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ionization source (Proxeon). The samples were concentrated on a trapping column (Acclaim PepMap C18, 300 μm × 5 mm, 5 μm, 100 Å, LC Packings) and washed with 0.1% formic acid at 30 μl/min for desalting. After 15 min, peptides were eluted over the separation column (BioBasic-4, 75 μm × 15 cm, 5 μm, ThermoFisher Scientific), which had been equilibrated with 100% solvent A (5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). The gradient for separation was 0–100% B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) in 15 min, followed by 100% B for 45 min at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. The trapping column was washed with methanol for 30 min and re-equilibrated with 0.1% formic acid between the runs. Between each sample, a blank run was performed using the same gradient as for the samples. Online MS full scans in the Orbitrap analyzer were performed in the 400–2000 m/z range (resolution 60,000 at m/z 400). For each spectrum 17 microscans were accumulated. MS and HPLC were controlled by Xcalibur 2.0.7 (Thermo Scientific) with DCMSlink 2.0 (Dionex). Data processing was performed with the Xcalibur Qual Browser. All mass spectra recorded during the elution of the C-terminal Lys-C fragment of PABPN1 were averaged and deconvoluted using the Xtract tool. Fluorescence Measurements-Fluorescence emission measurements were done with Fluoromax-2 or -3 fluorescence spectrophotometers (Horiba Jobin Yvon) in a fused silica cuvette at 30 °C in 50 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.5, in the presence or absence of 36 μm S-adenosylhomocysteine or 40 μm S-adenosylmethionine. Protein and peptide concentrations are indicated in the figure legends. For equilibrium experiments, the complex was allowed to form for 10 min at 30 °C prior to measurement. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded from 305 to 420 nm on excitation at 295 nm using a 5-nm slit width. The integration time was 1 s; each spectrum was an average of three single spectra. For kinetic measurements, 5 μm RXR-2 peptide or PABPN1 were incubated with 1 μm PRMT1 in the presence or absence of 36 μm S-adenosylhomocysteine or 40 μm S-adenosylmethionine. After complex formation for 10 min at 30 °C, an 8-fold excess of K2 peptide was added. The subsequent dissociation of RXR-2/PABPN1 from PRMT1 was followed by the loss of fluorescence intensity at 355 nm. Using the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine as well as a methyl-accepting protein, PRMTs catalyze a classic two-substrate reaction. Thus, the variation of both substrate concentrations provides insight into the reaction mechanism (33Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics.3rd Ed. Portland Press, London2004Google Scholar). Accordingly, the concentration of S-adenosylmethionine was varied at different concentrations of methyl acceptors. These experiments were carried out with PRMT1 and PRMT3 and two different methyl acceptors, PABPN1 and a standard PRMT substrate peptide, RGG (30Fronz K. Otto S. Kölbel K. Kühn U. Friedrich H. Schierhorn A. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20408-20420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Both enzymes behaved in a similar manner with both substrates: any increase in peptide or protein substrate concentration accelerated the S-adenosylmethionine consumption and vice versa till saturation was reached. The linearized plots intersected in one point in the second quadrant (Fig. 2 and additional data not shown). These results are consistent with previous data on PRMT1 and -6 (see Introduction) and support a ternary complex mechanism (33Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics.3rd Ed. Portland Press, London2004Google Scholar). For the investigation of PRMT processivity by product analysis, it was first necessary to determine whether substrates containing either monomethylated arginine or dimethylated arginine together with additional methylatable arginines were preferred substrates for PRMTs. Thus, corresponding synthetic peptides were compared as substrates at saturating S-adenosylmethionine concentrations. Initial reaction rates revealed a hyperbolic dependence on peptide concentration (data not shown), and the data were evaluated according to the canonical Michaelis-Menten algorithm. Due to the transfer of several methyl groups to a single peptide, mixtures of different substrates are expected to be present in the course of the reaction. Therefore, all kinetic parameters presented should be regarded as apparent constants. However, they are adequate for comparing different substrates. First, it was tested whether the substitution of arginine residues in the peptide RXR-1 (30Fronz K. Otto S. Kölbel K. Kühn U. Friedrich H. Schierhorn A. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20408-20420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1) by monomethylarginine or asymmetric dimethylarginine would improve further methylation by PRMT1. As shown below, RXR-1 methylation by PRMT1 occurs exclusively at Arg10. Substitution of Arg10 by monomethylarginine (peptide RXR-4) provoked a small decrease of both kcat and Km (supplemental Fig. S1 and Table 1) and no significant change in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). Thus, a preferential formation of dimethylated arginine residues specifically from previously monomethylated ones can be excluded. The substitution of a neighboring arginine, Arg8, by asymmetric dimethylarginine (peptide RXR-5) resulted in minor changes of kcat and Km and an insignificant increase in catalytic efficiency. When Arg12 was also changed, so that both arginines flanking the preferred methyl-accepting Arg10 were asymmetrically dimethylated (peptide RXR-6), no changes in substrate properties were apparent either (supplemental Fig. S1 and Table 1). We conclude that, at least for the peptide investigated, the methylation of one arginine residue does not affect the methylation of neighboring residues by PRMT1.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for peptide methylation by PRMT1peptideVmaxkcatKmkcat/Kmpmol min-1 mg-1s-1μm103 s-1 m-1K2aData from Ref. 30.20,6701.5 × 10-20.09168.0RGGaData from Ref. 30.18,2201.3 × 10-22.774.3RXR-1aData from Ref. 30.36,0202.5 × 10-21.2520.1RXR-2aData from Ref. 30.26,1001.8 × 10-20.3354.9RXR-417,7701.2 × 10-20.6917.9RXR-525,7201.8 × 10-20.6129.5RXR-630,5202.1 × 10-20.7030.4RXR-73,4550.24 × 10-222.240.1RXR-83,8890.27 × 10-28.010.3a Data from Ref. 30Fronz K.

Open table in a new tab When either Arg8 and Arg10 (peptide RXR-7) or Arg10 and Arg12 (peptide RXR-8) were replaced by asymmetric dimethylarginine, kcat was reduced to one-tenth, and the Km values went up about 10-fold (supplemental Fig. S1 and Table 1). As a result, the catalytic efficiency of PRMT1 against these peptides was reduced to less than 1%. This was expected because the preferred methyl acceptor, Arg10, was no longer available. The data show that methylation of this residue does not enhance methylation of neighboring arginines. In summary, our data obtained with partially methylated RXR-peptides demonstrate that monomethylated arginine residues are not preferred substrates and that even the presence of two pre-methylated arginine residues does not accelerate the methylation of the remaining one. We also tested whether mass spectrometry could be used for a quantitative analysis of methylation. For this purpose, peptides were modified with unlabeled S-adenosylmethionine, and the extent of total methylation was analyzed from weighted relative intensities of the MALDI-TOF MS signals for the various methylated species compared with the signal for the remaining unmodified substrate. In parallel, methylation was measured under identical conditions with the same concentration of [14C]S-adenosylmethionine at two different specific activities. The time courses of methylation determined by both methods were very similar (see supplemental Fig. S2 for two examples). When mixtures of three synthetic peptides were analyzed, amounts of the unmethylated peptide (RXR-1) were underestimated by 20.3 ± 3.8%, amounts of the singly methylated peptide (RXR-4) were underestimated by 11.7 ± 5.7%, and amounts of the 4-fold methylated peptide (RXR-6) were overestimat"

https://openalex.org/W2024825326,"Cardiovascular development is vital for embryonic survival and growth. Early gestation embryo loss or malformation has been linked to yolk sac vasculopathy and congenital heart defects (CHDs). However, the molecular pathways that underlie these structural defects in humans remain largely unknown hindering the development of molecular-based diagnostic tools and novel therapies.Murine embryos were exposed to high glucose, a condition known to induce cardiovascular defects in both animal models and humans. We further employed a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach to identify proteins differentially expressed in embryos with defects from those with normal cardiovascular development. The proteins detected by mass spectrometry (WNT16, ST14, Pcsk1, Jumonji, Morca2a, TRPC5, and others) were validated by Western blotting and immunoflorescent staining of the yolk sac and heart. The proteins within the proteomic dataset clustered to adhesion/migration, differentiation, transport, and insulin signaling pathways. A functional role for several proteins (WNT16, ADAM15 and NOGO-A/B) was demonstrated in an ex vivo model of heart development. Additionally, a successful application of a cluster of protein biomarkers (WNT16, ST14 and Pcsk1) as a prenatal screen for CHDs was confirmed in a study of human amniotic fluid (AF) samples from women carrying normal fetuses and those with CHDs.The novel finding that WNT16, ST14 and Pcsk1 protein levels increase in fetuses with CHDs suggests that these proteins may play a role in the etiology of human CHDs. The information gained through this bed-side to bench translational approach contributes to a more complete understanding of the protein pathways dysregulated during cardiovascular development and provides novel avenues for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, beneficial to fetuses at risk for CHDs."

Aminoglycoside 2″-phosphotransferases are clinically important enzymes that cause high levels of resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics by the organisms that harbor them.

Following their introduction to the clinic in the 1940s (1Schatz A. Waksman S.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1944; 57: 244-248Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 2Waksman S.A. Fenner F. Ann. N. Y.

Science. 1949; 109: 305-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), aminoglycoside antibiotics rapidly became important chemotherapeutic agents in treatment of various microbial infections. Clinical success of aminoglycosides was in large measure the result of broad spectrum of activity (4Akova M. Gur D. Livermore D.M. Kocagoz T. Akalin H.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1298-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Baker C.N. Hollis D.G. Thornsberry C. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1985; 22: 212-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gillespie S.H.

Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases. Churchill Livingstone, New York2005: 328-356Google Scholar, 16Nicolau D.P. Quintiliani Jr., R. Yu V.L. Merigan Jr., T.C. Barriere S.L. Antimicrobial Therapy and Vaccines. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore1999: 621-638Google Scholar). Another advantage was that in contrast to other antibiotic classes, such as β-lactams, emergence of resistance to aminoglycosides has occurred relatively slowly. Nonetheless, multiple mechanisms of resistance to this class of antibiotics have emerged over time (17Shaw K.J. Munayyer H. Rather P.N. Hare R.S. Miller G.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 18Vakulenko S.B. Mobashery S. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 16: 430-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). These resistance mechanisms have resulted in reduced efficacy of several of aminoglycoside antibiotics as well as obsolescence of others, such as kanamycin (19Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Mobashery S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 456: 27-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Structurally, aminoglycosides are broadly classified into three classes, 4,6-disubstituted, 4,5-disubstituted, and atypical (see supplemental Fig. 1). The primary means for resistance to aminoglycosides is the production of the enzymes that chemically modify the antibiotics. The chemical modifications of aminoglycosides alter their properties both sterically and electrostatically, such that the binding to the bacterial ribosome, the target for aminoglycosides, is compromised (20Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1987; 327: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 21Woodcock J. Moazed D. Cannon M. Davies J. Noller H.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3099-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Quantitative evaluations of these influences on binding to the ribosomal sites are few, but for the ones that have been investigated, the effects are substantial (22Llano-Sotelo B. Azucena Jr., E.F. Kotra L.P. Mobashery S. Chow C.S. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 455-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The antibiotic selection force has resulted in the emergence of genes that encode three families of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. These are aminoglycoside acetyltransferases, aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferases, and aminoglycoside phosphotransferases (APHs). 2The abbreviations used are: APH, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. They are all two-substrate enzymes that facilitate transfer of functionalities from the second substrate to the aminoglycoside. The second substrate is acetyl-coenzyme A in the case of aminoglycoside acetyltransferases, which transfers the acetylate moiety to amino groups at positions 1, 3, 2′, or 6′ of the antibiotics. Aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferases (adenylyltransferases) modify aminoglycoside antibiotics by the transfer of the AMP portion of ATP to the hydroxyl groups at positions 6, 9, 4′, 2″, or 3″ of the antibiotics. Finally, aminoglycoside phosphotransferases modify aminoglycoside antibiotics at 4-, 6-, 9-, 3′-, 2″-, 3″-, and 7″-hydroxyls of aminoglycosides by phosphorylation (see supplemental Fig. 1). Since the discovery of the APHs, it has been widely assumed that they use ATP as the second substrate (23Benveniste R. Davies J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2276-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 24Foster T.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 361-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This assumption has been based on the appreciation of the central roles that ATP plays in many biological processes but also on biochemical measurements that document that indeed ATP is a substrate for several of these enzymes. We have undertaken an enzymological study of the four APHs that were provisionally assigned to the class of (2″)-I phosphotransferases based on good sequence identity to the APH(2″)-Ia, whose regiospecificity of phosphate transfer was experimentally determined (25Azucena E. Grapsas I. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2317-2318Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These enzymes were originally isolated from Staphylococcus aureus (26Ferretti J.J. Gilmore K.S. Courvalin P. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and Enterococci (27Chow J.W. Zervos M.J. Lerner S.A. Thal L.A. Donabedian S.M. Jaworski D.D. Tsai S.

Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1229-1232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but later were also identified in Gram-negative bacterial isolates (30Chow J.W. Kak V. You I. Kao S.J. Petrin J. Clewell D.B. Lerner S.A. Miller G.H. Shaw K.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2691-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). They had been subsequently classified as APH(2″)-Ia, -Ib, -Ic, and -Id based on the available data on aminoglycoside resistance profiles that they produce and amino acid sequence of individual enzymes. The Roman numerals define resistance profile, and thus the assignment of identical Roman numeral I to all APH(2″) enzymes indicated that they produce the identical spectrum of resistance, whereas letters a, b, c, and d indicate that each enzyme is characterized by a unique amino acid sequence. Our analyses revealed that two of these enzymes (APH(2″)-Ia and -Ic) actually utilize GTP instead of ATP as the second substrate. This unexpected finding brings into question the dogmatic assertion that these enzymes are all ATP-dependent. Based on these findings, a new nomenclature for APH(2″) phosphotransferases is proposed herein. Future studies of APHs and also of aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferases should bring into sharp focus the issue of selectivity of the nucleotide triphosphates for the given enzyme. These nucleotide triphosphate preferences should have ramifications for understanding of the evolution, selection, and dissemination of the genes for these important enzymes. Cloning of the aph(2″) Genes-To ensure identical levels of expression for APH(2″)-Ia, -Ib, -Ic and -Id, we cloned the genes for these phosphotransferases under the same promoter of the aph(2″)-Ic gene in pBluescript II KS(+) vector (Stratagene). The detailed cloning procedure is described in the supplemental material and supplemental Fig. 2. For protein expression and purification, the genes for the APH(2″) enzymes were recloned into the expression vector pET22b(+) (Novagen), utilizing its NdeI site at the 5′-end and the HindIII site at the 3′-end. Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing-Antibiotics used in this study were from the following sources: kanamycin A, kanamycin B, tobramycin, sisomicin, G418, amikacin, neomycin, paromomycin, lividomycin A, butirosin, streptomycin, spectinomycin, apramycin, and hygromycin B from Sigma, gentamicin from Fluka, netilmicin and isepamicin from Schering Plough, dibekacin and arbekacin from Meiji Seika Kaisha, and fortimicin from Kyova Hakko Kogyo. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of various aminoglycoside antibiotics were determined in Mueller-Hinton II broth by the broth microdilution method according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (31Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically: Approved Standard.7th Ed. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, Wayne, PA2006Google Scholar). Escherichia coli JM83 strains harboring pBluescript::aph(2″)-Ia, -Ib, -Ic and -Id vectors were spread on agar plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. A parental E. coli JM83 strain harboring the plasmid pBluescript II KS(+) vector, which does not contain any genes for APH(2″) enzymes, was used as the control and was plated on antibiotic-free agar. After overnight incubation, three or four individual colonies were inoculated into 3 ml of Mueller-Hinton II broth and subgrown at 35 °C for several h until bacterial cultures reached an optical density of 0.6–0.8 at 600 nm. Optical densities of all cultures were equalized, and, after appropriate dilutions, the cultures were used to inoculate 96-well microtiter plates containing Mueller-Hinton II broth with 2-fold serial dilutions of various aminoglycoside antibiotics. The final bacterial inoculum was 5 × 105 colony-forming units/ml. The plates were incubated at 35 °C for 18 h before results were recorded. All MICs were determined in triplicate. Protein Expression and Purification-The APH(2″)-Ib and -Ic enzymes were purified as described elsewhere (32Badarau A. Shi Q. Chow J.W. Zajicek J. Mobashery S. Vakulenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7638-7647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 33Toth M. Zajicek J. Kim C. Chow J.W. Smith C. Mobashery S. Vakulenko S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5570-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For purification of APH(2″)-Ia and -Id, E. coli BL21(DE3) strains harboring the pET22b(+) vector with cloned aminoglycoside phosphotransferase genes were grown at 37 °C in LB medium (2 × 350 ml for each construct) supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin to A590 ∼ 0.8. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.8 mm), and cultures were incubated overnight at 20 °C (for APH(2″)-Ia) or 22 °C (for APH(2″)-Id) for the best protein yield and solubility. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation (3,000 × g for 15 min), resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 1 mm EDTA, and the cells were disrupted by repeated cycles of sonification (Bronson Sonifier 450 (VWR, West Chester, PA)), and debris was pelleted by subsequent centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. To remove nucleic acids (34Van Pelt J.E. Northrop D.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 230: 250-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the supernatant was mixed with streptomycin sulfate (1.5% final concentration) and stirred slowly at 4 °C for 30 min. Solutions were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was dialyzed twice against 2 liters of buffer A. The APH (2″)-Ia enzyme was purified by DEAE anion exchange chromatography. The enzyme was eluted with a gradient of NaCl (0–1 m) in buffer A, and fractions were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Enzyme-containing fractions (eluted at 0.4–0.5 m NaCl) were pooled, concentrated to 30 ml, dialyzed against buffer A, and loaded on an Affi-Gel 15-gentamicin affinity column (35Kim C. Haddad J. Vakulenko S.B. Meroueh S.O. Wu Y. Yan H. Mobashery S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2373-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). APH (2″)-Ia was eluted with gradient of NaCl (0–1 m) in buffer A. Fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE, and those that contained the purified APH (2″)-Ia protein (eluted at 0.55–0.7 m of NaCl) were pooled, concentrated to 8 mg/ml, dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and stored in liquid nitrogen. APH(2″)-Id was purified first by affinity chromatography (Affi-Gel 15-gentamicin; 2.5 × 12 cm) and prepared as described previously (35Kim C. Haddad J. Vakulenko S.B. Meroueh S.O. Wu Y. Yan H. Mobashery S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2373-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After elution with a NaCl gradient, fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those that contained APH(2″)-Id (eluted at 0.3–0.5 m NaCl) were pooled, concentrated to 30 ml, and dialyzed against buffer A. The enzyme was further purified by DEAE anion exchange chromatography (2.5 × 18 cm) and eluted with a gradient of NaCl (0–1 m), and the fractions that contained the purified APH (2″)-Id (eluted at 0.25–0.35 m NaCl) were concentrated to 8 mg/ml, dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol and stored in aliquots at –80 °C. All enzymes used in this study were purified to homogeneity, as judged by SDS-PAGE. Enzyme Kinetics-A continuous spectrophotometric assay was employed to monitor phosphorylation of kanamycin A by aminoglycoside phosphotransferases in the presence of various NTPs as the second substrates for the enzymes. In this assay, conversion of NDP released during the reaction back to NTP is coupled to the production of lactate from pyruvate and measured as a function of NADH oxidation. In a typical experiment, assays were performed in a total volume of 250 μl containing 100 mm reaction buffer (see below), 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 140 μm NADH, 15 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 20 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, kanamycin A at a fixed saturating concentration (see below) and NTP at variable concentrations. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme (200 nm for APH(2″)-Ia; 4–40 nm for APH(2″)-Ib; 100–700 nm for APH(2″)-Id). To find the best conditions for kinetics assays, a set of buffers was used in pilot experiments. In the final experiments, sodium HEPES, pH 7.0, was used in assays with APH(2″)-Ia, sodium HEPES, pH 7.5, with APH(2″)-Ib and MOPS, pH 7.5, with APH(2″)-Id. Ionic strength of all buffers was adjusted to 80 mm with NaCl. Depending on the enzyme, concentrations of kanamycin A were between 20 and 100 μm (to ensure enzyme saturation and to avoid substrate inhibition, which has precedence for APHs (36McKay G.A. Wright G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). When CTP was used in the coupled assay, the concentration of pyruvate kinase in the reaction mixture was increased to 60 units/ml due to the poor turnover of CDP by this enzyme. When UTP was used as the phosphate donor, assay conditions were modified due to the presence of 15–20% of UDP in the commercially available sample of UTP. Specifically, 5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 300 mm NADH, and 20 units/ml of lactate dehydrogenase were added to the reaction mixture containing all of the needed components (see above), with the exception of kanamycin A and the enzyme. The reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically to ensure complete conversion of UDP to UTP, upon which APH(2″) and kanamycin A were added to initiate the reaction. Conditions and the results for kinetics with APH(2″)-Ic were described elsewhere (32Badarau A. Shi Q. Chow J.W. Zajicek J. Mobashery S. Vakulenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7638-7647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Calculations of the steady-state kinetic parameters for each substrate were performed with GraFit 4.0 software. The values for kcat, Km, and kcat/Km were determined by fitting the kinetic data to the following equation,v=Vmax[S]Km+[S] where kcat = Vmax/[E], v is the initial velocity, Vmax is the maximum reaction velocity, [S] is the substrate concentration, [E]is the enzyme concentration, and Km is the Michaelis constant of the variable substrate. Aminoglycoside Resistance Profile-Aminoglycoside resistance profiles produced by various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes have been used as an important criterion for their classification. However, direct comparison of the reported aminoglycoside resistance profiles is complicated by the fact that the genes for these enzymes could have different promoters, might be located on different types of plasmids, or might be of chromosomal origin. These disparate locations for the requisite genes could result in expression of the genes at significantly different levels. To circumvent this problem, we fused the genes for the APH(2″)-Ia, -Ib, and -Id with the promoter of aph(2″)-Ic. Then the genes encoding the four APH(2″) enzymes were cloned in pBluescript II KS(+) vector and transformed into the same bacterial host, E. coli JM83. Levels of resistance to individual aminoglycoside antibiotics conferred by the four phosphotransferases vary significantly, with the APH(2″)-Id being the least competent (Table 1). Meanwhile, the spectrum of antibiotic resistance is similar across the strains that harbor the individual enzymes. All four APH(2″)s produced resistance to most 4,6-disubstituted aminoglycosides (kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, sisomicin, netilmicin, dibekacin, and G418) with the exception of the semisynthetic isepamicin, which has a 4-amino-2-hydroxypropionyl substituent on the nitrogen at position 1 of the aminocyclitol ring (Table 1). Resistance to the semisynthetic amikacin and arbekacin, which have a 4-amino-2-hydroxybutyryl substituent at the same position, was only slightly (2-fold) increased in the strains producing APH(2″)-Ia and APH(2″)-Ib (Table 1). Of the four 4,5-disubstituted aminoglycosides tested (neomycin B, paromomycin, lividomycin A, and butirosin), resistance was increased merely 2-fold for neomycin, only for the strain expressing APH(2″)-Ia (see Table 1 for neomycin). Finally, we also tested the MICs of the so-called atypical aminoglycosides (streptomycin, spectinomycin, fortimicin, apramycin, and hygromycin) against strains producing APH(2″)s. None of these enzymes were able to elevate the MICs to atypical aminoglycoside antibiotics (data not shown).TABLE 1MICs of aminoglycoside antibiotics for E. coli JM83 producing various APH(2″) enzymesEnzymeMICKanAKanBGenTobSisNetDbkG418AmkArbIseNeoParμg/mlIa2563232161643251221114Ib12864163288645122110.54Ic16646412832425612810.510.54Id16163216821612810.510.54ControlaParental E. coli JM83 strain harboring plasmid pBluescript II KS(+) vector, which does not contain any genes for APH(2″) enzymes.210.250.50.250.250.5210.510.54a Parental E. coli JM83 strain harboring plasmid pBluescript II KS(+) vector, which does not contain any genes for APH(2″) enzymes. Open table in a new tab Aminoglycoside Substrate Profile-Although phenotypes of aminoglycoside resistance produced by various 2″-phosphotransferases are almost identical, their aminoglycoside substrate profile is more diverse. It has been reported that APH(2″)-Ia phosphorylates a broad array of aminoglycosides, including 4,6-disubstituted kanamycin A, gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmicin, dibekacin, sisomicin, isepamicin, and amikacin and 4,5-disubstituted neomycin B, paromomycin, lividomycin A, ribostamycin, and butirosin (Table 2) (37Daigle D.M. Hughes D.W. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 99-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In contrast to APH(2″)-Ia, none of the other APH(2″)-I enzymes are able to utilize 4,5-disubstituted aminoglycosides as the substrates (Table 2). APH(2″)-Ib phosphorylates a broad array of 4,6-disubstituted compounds (kanamycin A, gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmicin, dibekacin, sisomicin, isepamicin, amikacin, and arbekacin; Table 2). Among the APH(2″) enzymes, APH(2″)-Ic has the narrowest spectrum of aminoglycoside substrates, which includes 4,6-disubstituted compounds kanamycin A, gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmicin, dibekacin, and sisomicin but not 4,6-disubstituted isepamicin, amikacin, and arbekacin or any of the atypical aminoglycosides tested (Table 2). Finally, APH(2″)-Id has an aminoglycoside substrate profile identical to that of APH(2″)-Ib, which includes a wide range of 4,6-disubstituted compounds but not any of the 4,5-disubstituted or atypical aminoglycosides (Table 2).TABLE 2Aminoglycoside substrate profile of APH(2″) enzymesEnzyme4,6-Disubstituted aminoglycosides4,5-Disubstituted aminoglycosidesKanGenTobNetDbkSisIseAmkArbNeoParLivButIaSSSSSSSSNRSSSSIbSSSSSSSSSNSNSNSNSIcSSSSSSNSNSNSNSNSNSNSIdSSSSSSSSSNSNSNSNS Open table in a new tab Nucleotide Triphosphate Profile-We recently performed the detailed kinetic analysis of APH(2″)-Ic and for the first time demonstrated that it utilizes not ATP but rather GTP as the phosphate donor (32Badarau A. Shi Q. Chow J.W. Zajicek J. Mobashery S. Vakulenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7638-7647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Based on this unexpected finding, we studied five nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs), ATP, GTP, ITP, UTP, and CTP as phosphate donors for the APH(2″)-catalyzed reaction with kanamycin A for the APH(2″)-Ia, -Ib, and -Id. For these experiments, we purified the three additional APH(2″)s to homogeneity. NTPs containing pyrimidine bases in their structures are very poor substrates for APH(2″)-Ia, -Ib, -Ic, and -Id. Catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) for phosphorylation of kanamycin A using UTP as the second substrate are between 60 and 900 m–1 s–1. The reaction with CTP could not even be attempted, because it was an exceedingly poor substrate. We estimate that the turnover number (kobs) for the case of CTP was <0.1 s–1 (Table 3). Although it is widely accepted that aminoglycoside phosphotransferases utilize ATP as the phosphate donor in their catalytic reaction, our data demonstrate that it is not broadly the case with APH(2″)s. Only one, APH(2″)-Ib, showed significant preference for ATP (Km = 16 ± 2 μm and kcat/Km = (2.7 ± 0.4) × 106 m–1 s–1) over GTP (Km = 70 ± 2 μm and kcat/Km = (1.3 ± 0.1) × 105 m–1 s–1) and ITP (Km = 660 ± 40 μm and kcat/Km = (2.5 ± 0.2) × 104 m–1 s–1) (Table 3). APH(2″)-Ia, and -Ic demonstrate strong preference for GTP over ATP, as judged by both smaller Km values and larger kcat/Km. For APH(2″)-Ia, kcat/Km of phosphate transfer from GTP is (1.4 ± 0.1) × 105 m–1 s–1, which is more than 800-fold larger than for ATP. This significantly diminished catalytic efficiency with ATP results from both larger Km (870 μm for ATP versus 3.5 μm for GTP) and slightly smaller kcat (3-fold lower for ATP, compared with GTP) values. ITP is also a much better substrate than ATP for APH(2″)-Ia (more than 400-fold difference in kcat/Km). As is the case with GTP, improved catalytic efficiency with ITP versus ATP is the result of a significantly smaller Km value. It would appear that the differences in structures within the purine bases of ATP and GTP are crucial for the efficiency of NTP binding by APH(2″)-Ia (Fig. 1). The active sites would have evolved differentially for selective recognition of these structural differences in the substrates. Very similar Km values and identical turnover numbers for APH(2″)-Ia with GTP and ITP as the substrates argue against significant contribution of an amino group at position C2 for binding of NTP substrate (Fig. 1).TABLE 3NTP substrate profile of APH(2″) enzymesEnzymeATPGTPITPUTPKmkcatkcat/KmKmkcatkcat/KmKmkcatkcat/KmKmkcatkcat/Kmμms-1m-1 s-1μms-1m-1 s-1μms-1m-1 s-1μms-1m-1 s-1APH(2″)-Ia870 ± 850.17 ± 0.01(1.9 ± 0.2) × 1023.5 ± 0.20.51 ± 0.02(1.4 ± 0.1) × 1055.9 ± 0.30.49 ± 0.02(8.3 ± 0.6) × 104720 ± 200.47 ± 0.01(6.6 ± 0.3) × 102APH(2″)-Ib16 ± 243 ± 2(2.7 ± 0.4) × 10670 ± 29.4 ± 0.1(1.3 ± 0.1) × 105660 ± 4016.5 ± 0.5(2.5 ± 0.2) × 1041860 ± 2001.7 ± 0.1(9.1 ± 1.1) × 102APH(2″)-Ic1600 ± 2000.1 ± 0.02(6.2 ± 1.4) × 1014 ± 0.50.8 ± 0.1(2.0 ± 0.3) × 10539 ± 52.1 ± 0.2(5.4 ± 0.8) × 1041300 ± 2000.14 ± 0.02(1.1 ± 0.2) × 102APH(2″)-Id101 ± 80.83 ± 0.02(8.2 ± 0.7) × 103137 ± 50.83 ± 0.01(6.1 ± 0.2) × 103235 ± 50.9 ± 0.01(3.9 ± 0.1) × 1032200 ± 2500.13 ± 0.01(6.1 ± 0.7) × 101 Open table in a new tab Even a greater difference is observed for APH(2″)-Ic, whose catalytic efficiency with GTP and kanamycin A as substrates is more than 3,000-fold above that with ATP as a phosphate donor. As in the case with the APH(2″)-Ia, the decrease of kcat and significant increase of Km contribute to the observed drop in catalytic efficiency (Table 3). The comparison of kcat and Km values for APH(2″)-Ic with kanamycin and ATP, GTP, or ITP indicates that the nature of the functional groups at both C6 and C2 positions of the purine are important for NTP binding by this enzyme (see Table 3 and Fig. 1). Finally, APH(2″)-Id demonstrates similar catalytic efficiencies with three purine-containing NTPs, ATP (kcat/Km = (8.2 ± 0.7) × 103 m–1s–1), GTP (kcat/Km = (6.1 ± 0.2) × 103 m–1 s–1), or ITP (kcat/Km = (3.9 ± 0.1) × 103 m–1 s–1) as phosphate donors (Table 3). Overall, among APH(2″) enzymes, APH(2″)-Id exhibits the lowest catalytic efficiency for the preferred NTP substrate that correlates well with the lowest MICs values produced by this enzyme. The recently determined estimates of the concentrations of various NTPs in E. coli in midlog phase of culture growth are 3,560 μm for ATP, 1,160 μm for GTP, 667 μm for UTP, and 325 μm for CTP (38Buckstein M.H. He J. Rubin H. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Given that the Km values for GTP for APH(2″)-Ia and APH(2″)-Ic are 3.5 and 4.0 μm, respectively, whereas the corresponding values for ATP are 870 and 1,600 μm, it is reasonable to assume that GTP and not ATP is the preferred second substrate for these enzymes in vivo. New Nomenclature for APH(2″)s-According to the existing nomenclature for aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (39Shaw K.J. Rather P.N. Hare R.S. Miller G.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 138-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the abbreviations APH (aminoglycoside phosphotransferase), AAC (aminoglycoside acetyltransferase), and ANT (aminoglycoside nucleotidyl- or adenylyltransferase) in the enzyme names define the type of enzymatic modification and signify the enzyme family. The site of antibiotic modification is used to further designate members of the three families into classes. This is indicated in parenthesis after the family name; for example, (3), (3′), and (2″), indicate modifications of functionalities at positions 3, 3′, and 2″ of the antibiotic, respectively. Roman numerals I, II, III, etc., are used for subdividing the enzymes into unique antibiotic resistance profiles. Finally, individual enzymes of the same type that differ by amino acid sequence are distinguished by lowercase letters a, b, c, etc. According to this nomenclature, APH(2″)-Ia, -Ib, Ic, and -Id are four unique proteins conferring an identical spectrum of antibiotic resistance. Aminoglycoside phosphotransferase of the bifunctional aminoglycoside acetyltransferase(6′)-Ie-APH(2″)-Ia enzyme from S. aureus was the first characterized enzyme of the APH(2″) class. Regiospecificity of phosphate transfer to 4,6-disubstituted aminoglycosides by this enzyme was experimentally confirmed (25Azucena E. Grapsas I. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2317-2318Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This enzyme is able to phosphorylate the hydroxyl groups at different positions other than 2″ in various aminoglycoside antibiotics (37Daigle D.M. Hughes D.W. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 99-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although 4,6-disubstituted aminoglycosides were phosphorylated exclusively at 2″-OH, the 4,5-disubstituted aminoglycoside lividomycin was modified at the 5″-OH, whereas another 4,5-disubstituted aminoglycoside neomycin was phosphorylated at two positions, the 3′-OH (primarily) and the 3‴-OH. Subsequently, the three additional enzymes APH(2″)-Ib, -Ic, and -Id were provisionally assigned to the class of (2″)-I phosphotransferases based on the sequence identity (from 22 to 33%) with the APH(2″)-Ia enzyme (Table 4) (27Chow J.W. Zervos M.J. Lerner S.A. Thal L.A. Donabedian S.M. Jaworski D.D. Tsai S. Shaw K.J. Clewell D.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 511-514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kao S.J. You I.

Clewell D.B. Donabedian S.M. Sahm D.F. Chow J.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1229-1232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although amino acid sequence identity among the enzymes assigned to the APH(2″) class of phosphotransferases is relatively low (e.g. enzymes of the APH(3′) family exhibit up to 44% sequence identity at the maximum), they are even less homologous to other aminoglycoside phosphotransferases (amino acid sequence identity between APH(2″) and APH(3′), for example, is between 14 and 20%).TABLE 4Amino acid sequence identity between APH(2″) phosphotransferasesEnzymePercentage identityAPH(2″)-IaAPH(2″)-IbAPH(2″)-IcAPH(2″)-Id%%%%APH(2″)-Ia100APH(2″)-Ib33100APH(2″)-Ic2224100APH(2″)-Id263027100 Open table in a new tab As an important step in confirming their assignment as members of the APH(2″) class of phosphotransferases, we were able to confirm that APH(2″)-Ib and -Ic transfer phosphate to the 2″-hydroxyl of kanamycin A (32Badarau A. Shi Q. Chow J.W. Zajicek J. Mobashery S. Vakulenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7638-7647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 33Toth M. Zajicek J. Kim C. Chow J.W. Smith C. Mobashery S. Vakulenko S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5570-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The nature of the 2″-phosphorylation of aminoglycosides by APH(2″)-Ia was documented earlier (25Azucena E. Grapsas I. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2317-2318Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have performed the same for APH(2″)-Id and compared the phosphorylated kanamycin A with an authentic sample. Indeed, APH(2″)-Id also phosphorylates the 2″-hydroxyl. Hence, all of these are bona fide APH(2″) enzymes. We note that when we cloned the genes for these APH(2″)s under the same promoter in the pBluescript II KS(+) vector, the antibiotic resistance profiles produced by the individual enzymes were similar but not identical (Table 1). Therefore, one cannot assign the same Roman numeral to all four enzymes. Even greater differences were observed when kinetic analyses were performed. Kinetics studies reported for APH(2″)-Ia (37Daigle D.M. Hughes D.W. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 99-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and our studies of APH(2″)-Ib, -Ic, and -Id phosphotransferases demonstrate that they have unique aminoglycoside substrate profiles (Table 2). The APH(2″)-Ia phosphotransferase domain of the bifunctional enzyme has a very broad spectrum of antibiotic substrates, including both 4,5- and 4,6-disubstituted aminoglycosides, whereas 4,5-disubstituted aminoglycosides are not substrates for APH(2″)-Ib, -Ic, and -Id enzymes. Moreover, the APH(2″)-Ib and -Id enzymes are able to utilize as substrates all 4,6-disubstituted aminoglycosides tested, but some of these antibiotics (amikacin and isepamicin) are not substrates for APH(2″)-Ic. The data presented in this report demonstrate yet another important distinction among enzymes of the APH(2″) family, namely their preference for the second substrate, the nucleotide triphosphate (Table 3). Remarkably, and contrary to the established dogma, only one of the four APH(2″) enzymes, APH(2″)-Ib, has a clear preference for ATP. APH(2″)-Ia and APH(2″)-Ic strongly prefer GTP as the second substrate, whereas APH(2″)-Id demonstrates similar catalytic efficiencies with either of these NTPs. Taken together, these data indicate that classification of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes based solely on their antibiotic resistance profile would not be adequate, and a more detailed characterization of enzymes that includes both the antibiotic and NTP substrate profiling is required. Our kinetic studies of APH(2″) phosphotransferases clearly demonstrated that each of these enzymes has its unique substrate profile. We thus propose a new nomenclature for the class of APH(2″)s. According to this new nomenclature, the Roman numeral would indicate the unique substrate profile, which would include both the aminoglycoside and the NTP substrates rather than an antibiotic resistance profile of bacterial isolates. Based on this nomenclature, the APH(2″) enzymes formerly known as APH(2″)-Ib, -Ic, and -Id are now named APH(2″)-IIa, -IIIa, and IVa, respectively (Table 5), thus accommodating our finding that each enzyme of the APH(2″) family has a unique substrate profile.TABLE 5New nomenclature for APH(2″) enzymesSubstrate profileNTP substrateOld nomenclatureNew nomenclatureEnzyme nameGene nameEnzyme nameGene nameKan, Gen, Tob, Net, Dbk, Sis, Ise, Amk, Neo, Par, Liv, Rib, ButGTPAPH(2″)-Iaaph(2″)-IaAPH(2″)-Iaaph(2″)-IaKan, Gen, Tob, Net, Dbk, Sis, Ise, Amk, Arb,ATPAPH(2″)-Ibaph(2″)-IbAPH(2″)-IIaaph(2″)-IIaKan, Gen, Tob, Net, Dbk, SisGTPAPH(2″)-Icaph(2″)-IcAPH(2″)-IIIaaph(2″)-IIIaKan, Gen, Tob, Net, Dbk, Sis, Ise, Amk, Arb,ATP/GTPAPH(2″)-Idaph(2″)-IdAPH(2″)-IVaaph(2″)-IVa Open table in a new tab"

Here, we report that lymphocytes play a controlling role in mediating gut epithelial apoptosis in sepsis but not under basal conditions. Gut epithelial apoptosis is similar in unmanipulated Rag-1(-/-) and wild-type (WT) mice. However, Rag-1(-/-) animals have a 5-fold augmentation in gut epithelial apoptosis following cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) compared to septic WT mice. Reconstitution of lymphocytes in Rag-1(-/-) mice via adoptive transfer decreases intestinal apoptosis to levels seen in WT animals. Subset analysis indicates that CD4(+) but not CD8(+), gammadelta, or B cells are responsible for the antiapoptotic effect of lymphocytes on the gut epithelium. Gut-specific overexpression of Bcl-2 in transgenic mice decreases mortality following CLP. This survival benefit is lymphocyte dependent since gut-specific overexpression of Bcl-2 fails to alter survival when the transgene is overexpressed in Rag-1(-/-) mice. Further, adoptively transferring lymphocytes to Rag-1(-/-) mice that simultaneously overexpress gut-specific Bcl-2 results in improved mortality following sepsis. Thus, sepsis unmasks CD4(+) lymphocyte control of gut apoptosis that is not present under homeostatic conditions, which acts as a key determinant of both cellular survival and host mortality."

In this study the structural requirement of transmembrane segment 1 (TM1) residues in mediating NBCe1-A transport was investigated. Twenty-five introduced cysteine mutants at positions Gln-424 to Gly-448 were tested for their sensitivity to the methanethiosulfonate reagents (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate (MTSES), [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTSET), and (2-aminoethyl) methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA). Two mutants, T442C and A435C, showed 100 and 70% sensitivity, respectively, to inhibition by all the three methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents, I441C had >50% sensitivity to MTSET and MTSEA, and A428C had 50% sensitivity to MTSEA inhibition. A helical wheel plot showed that mutants T442C, A435C, and A428C are clustered on one face of TM1 within a 100 degrees arc. Topology analysis of TM1 with biotin maleimide and 2-((5(6)-tetramethylrhodamine)carboxylamino) ethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTS-TAMRA) revealed Thr-442 marks the C-terminal end of TM1 and that extracellular FGGLLG stretch is in a small aqueous-accessible cavity. Functional studies indicated that Thr-442 resides in a narrow region of the ion translocation pore with strong delta(-) helical dipole influence. Analysis of the corresponding residue of NBCe1-A-Thr-442 in AE1 (Thr-422) shows it is functionally insensitive to MTSES and unlabeled with MTS-TAMRA, indicating that AE1-TM1 is oriented differently from NBCe1-A. In summary, we have identified residues Thr-442, Ala-435, and Ala-428 in TM1 lining the ion translocation pore of NBCe1-A. Our findings are suggestive of a delta(-) helical dipole at the C-terminal end of TM1 involving Thr-442 that plays a critical role in the function of the cotransporter."

The subsarcolemmal location of dystrophin, as well as its association with both cytoskeleton and membrane, suggests a role in the mechanical regulation of muscular membrane stress.

In this study, we made use of rare missense pathogenic mutations in the dystrophin gene and analyzed the biochemical properties of the isolated repeat 23 bearing single or double mutations E2910V and N2912D found in muscle dystrophy with severity grading. No dramatic effect on secondary and tertiary structure of the repeat was found in mutants compared with wild type as revealed by circular dichroism and NMR. Thermal and chemical unfolding data from circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence show significant decrease of stability for the mutants, and stopped-flow spectroscopy shows decreased refolding rates. The most deleterious single mutation is the N2912D replacement, although we observe additive effects of the two mutations on repeat stability. Based on three-dimensional structures built by homology molecular modeling, we discuss the modifications of the mutation-induced repeat stability.

Dystrophin-associated muscular dystrophies range from the severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) 3The abbreviations used are: DMD, Duchenne muscular dystrophy; R23, rod domain 23; WT, wild type; BMD, Becker muscular dystrophy; DGC, dystrophin glycoprotein complex; GST, glutathione S-transferase. to the milder Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Molecular genetic studies indicate that both disorders are the result of mutations in the huge gene that encodes dystrophin (1Hoffman E.P. Brown R.H. Kunkel L.M. Cell. 1987; 51: 919-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3687) Google Scholar). Approximately two-thirds of the mutations in DMD and BMD are intragenic partial deletions (2Darras B.T. Blattner P. Harper J.F. Spiro A.J. Alter S. Francke U. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1988; 43: 620-629PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, deletion of exons disrupting the reading frame leads to premature translational termination and absence of the protein in DMD cases. On the other hand, mutations maintaining the translational reading frame can lead to semi-functional microdystrophins in BMD cases (3Koenig M. Beggs A.H. Moyer M. Scherpf S. Heindrich K. Bettecken T.

Despite the potential importance of this source of information on protein behavior in cells, the consequences of these mutations on biological properties of dystrophin are so far poorly documented, mainly because of the size and complexity of the cellular partnership of the protein. Dystrophin is a 427-kDa protein included within the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) (8Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The N-terminal part of dystrophin is reported as a globular actin binding domain 1 (9Norwood F.L. Sutherland-Smith A.J. Keep N.H. Kendrick-Jones J. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: 481-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The C-terminal cysteine-rich domain of dystrophin is the binding region to the DGC by means to link to β-dystroglycan (10Huang X. Poy F. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Sudol M. Eck M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The dystrophin central rod domain is made up of 24 weakly repeating units of 110 amino acids similar to the coiled-coil repeats of spectrin, and it is disrupted by four potential hinges that may ensure flexibility (11Koenig M. Kunkel L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4560-4566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These homologous sequence motifs have been proposed to form domains with a triple-helical bundle-type structure (12Parry D.A. Dixon T.W. Cohen C. Biophys.

To understand fully the biological role of the rod domain, further investigations are needed concerning the relationship between the sequences of the repeating units and their biochemical and biophysical properties.

Its proximity with the β-dystroglycan could contribute to proper mechanical behavior of the DGC in muscle. Most of the rare BMD point mutations correspond to the following: (i) missense mutations in the N-terminal or C-terminal domains or (ii) splice-site mutations that likely act, like BMD deletions, via the production of deleted in-frame transcripts. Only few missense DMD- or BMD-linked point mutations have been reported in the dystrophin gene. 70 of such mutations were reviewed in the dystrophin gene encoding the rod domain (5Roberts R.G.

Single mutation N2912D is mentioned in three cases from the Leiden data base with no mention of a pathology DMD, intermediary muscular dystrophy, or BMD pathology, but they are characterized as polymorphic variants (27Prior T.W. Wenger G.D. Papp A.C. Snyder P.J. Sedra M.S. Bartolo C. Moore J.W. Highsmith W.E. Hum. Mutat. 1995; 5: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Leiden data base (23Aartsma-Rus A. Van Deutekom J.C. Fokkema I.F. Van Ommen G.J. Den Dunnen J.T. Muscle Nerve. 2006; 34: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) lists one example of a double mutation at the same site E2910G/N2912D, which is associated with a milder Becker muscular dystrophy. This indicates that, in association with the N2912D mutation, the E2910V mutation might have a more severe effect with respect to the disease state. In this study, we aim to improve our understanding of the role of the rod domain in dystrophin and putative molecular basis of muscular dystrophy. We analyze in vitro the consequences of the natural single or double mutation E2910V/N2912D on isolated repeat 23. The main result is that the double mutant R23 E2910V/N2912D shows a substantially lower thermal and chemical stability as well as slower refolding than the wild type. The variation in the double mutant compared with the wild type is larger that those observed for the single mutants. We construct homology-based molecular model structures of the wild type and mutated repeat 23 of dystrophin. We propose that the changes in stability of a repeat from the rod domain could explain the loss of mechanical properties of dystrophin and thus the defects in muscle cells. Materials-The pGEX-4T1 plasmid vector, GSTrap™ HP columns were purchased from GE Healthcare. The ER2566 bacteria were supplied by Ozyme (St. Quentin-en-Yvelines, France) and restriction enzymes by Promega (Charbonières, France). Cloning-The plasmid pTG11025, kindly provided by Dr. S. Braun (Transgene, Strasbourg, France), is an Escherichia coli plasmid that carries the cDNA encoding the full-length Dp427m isoform of human dystrophin (NCBI Nucleotide Data Base code NM_004006). Recombinant dystrophin rod domain wild type and mutated single repeat R23 were cloned downstream of the sequence of glutathione S-transferase (GST) into pGEX-4T1 vector, using the BamHI restriction site of the pre-Scission thrombin recognition sequence and XhoI restriction site, as described previously for wild type single repeat R23 (20Legardinier S. Hubert J.F. Le Bihan O. Tascon C. Rocher C. Raguenes-Nicol C. Bondon A. Hardy S. Le Rumeur E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by PCR using complementary oligonucleotide primers containing single and double missense mutations (E2910V/N2912D) and primers previously used to clone single repeat R23. The PCR-amplified fragments encoding mutated single repeat R23 were subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Charbonnieres, France), sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (Genome Express, Meylan, France), and directly cloned in the pGEX-4T1 vector using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. Boundaries of Wild Type and Mutated Single Repeat R23-Boundaries of recombinant R23 single repeats were extended by assuming the original alignment of spectrin-type triple-helical repeats in dystrophin as proposed previously (28Winder S.J. Gibson T.J. Kendrick-Jones J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The four recombinant proteins were extended with six additional residues at the N-terminal end, including the N-terminal glycine-serine dipeptide resulting from thrombin cleavage of GST fusion proteins and seven additional residues at the C-terminal end according to Gratzer and co-workers (29Calvert R. Kahana E. Gratzer W.B. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1605-1610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 30Kahana E. Gratzer W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8110-8114Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), who recommended extending the constructs by six to eight residues to improve solubility and stability. Preparation of Wild Type and Mutated Single Repeat R23-Plasmid constructs were used to transform into the protease-deficient E. coli ER2566 strain, and cultures were then grown to an absorbance of 0.5 at 600 nm at 37 °C in LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Expression of GST fusion proteins was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 4 h, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. As described previously (20Legardinier S. Hubert J.F. Le Bihan O. Tascon C. Rocher C. Raguenes-Nicol C. Bondon A. Hardy S. Le Rumeur E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), pellets from 500 ml of culture were resuspended in 20 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and incubated with 0.5 mg·ml-1 lysozyme on ice for 30 min before being broken up by sonication (U200S, UKA Labortechnic). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, filtered extracts were loaded onto a pre-equilibrated 5-ml GSTrap™ HP column at a flow rate of about 0.25 ml·min-1. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml·min-1, and 250 units thrombin were then added. On-column cleavage took place for 48 h at 4 °C, and fractions of 5 ml were collected in the washing buffer. Fractions were concentrated on 3K Centricon, and the final purification steps consisted of ion exchange chromatography on HiTrap Q FF (GE Healthcare) or fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 column in lysis buffer containing 0.1 mm EDTA (TNE buffer). Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE, and concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay with bovine albumin as standard. Fast protein liquid chromatography analytical size exclusion chromatography was performed in TNE buffer on a Sephacryl S-100 column calibrated with alcohol dehydrogenase (RS = 4.6 nm, where RS indicates Stokes radius), bovine serum albumin (RS = 3.5 nm), ovalbumin (RS = 2.7 nm), and cytochrome c (RS = 1.7 nm). Circular Dichroism Measurements-CD spectra were acquired at 20 °C with a path length of 0.2 cm on a Jasco J-715 or J-815 spectropolarimeter, equipped with Peltier devices for temperature control. From the molar ellipticity at 222 nm [θ222], the mean residue ellipticity [θ]MRW was calculated using the mean residue molar concentration of the proteins, and the percentage of α-helix was obtained using a 100% α-helix value of -36,000 degrees·cm2·dmol-1 at 222 nm according to Ref. 31Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar. The thermal unfolding of each construct was monitored by CD at 222 nm at concentrations of 2.5 μm in TNE buffer with temperature increasing 1 °C/min from 15 to 85 °C. CD signals were fitted either to two-state or three-state transitions. For the two-state transition, the data are fitted to Equation 1, y=(αN+βNT)+(αD+βDT)1+e-ΔGUNRT where y is the CD signal at 222 nm at temperature T; αN and αD are the intercepts of the native and denatured states, respectively; and βN and βD are the slopes of the native and denatured states, respectively; ΔGUN is the free energy of unfolding, and R is the gas constant in cal·mol-1·K-1. As described previously (32Kusunoki H. Minasov G. MacDonald R. Mondragon A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 495-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), this equation can be rewritten as Equation 2 to facilitate nonlinear regression analysis by SigmaPlot 10.0 in Windows, where Tm is the melting temperature, and ΔT is the width of the unfolding transition. In the case of a three-state unfolding process, Equation 2 can be written as Equation 3, where αI is the intercept of the intermediate state; βI is the slope of the intermediate state; Tm1 is the melting temperature of the first transition between folded and intermediate state; and Tm2 is the melting temperature of the second transition between the intermediate and denatured state. Steady-state Fluorescence Measurements and Urea Unfolding-Tryptophan fluorescence spectra of native or urea-treated proteins at 1 μm in TNE buffer were recorded at 295 nm excitation wavelength (bandwidth, 1 nm) on a Fluorolog 3 spectrofluorometer (Horiba Jobin-Yvon, France), using 10 × 4-mm quartz cuvettes at 20 °C. After appropriate correction, we obtained the emission spectra of nondenatured proteins. For denatured proteins previously incubated for 2 h in TNE with 0.25-8 m urea, we obtained the maximum wavelength (λmax) and intensity of fluorescence from the emission spectra. The unfolded fraction, y, was then plotted as a function of urea concentration, U, and fitted to a one-transition, two-state reversible process as described by Ref. 33MacDonald R. Pozharski E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3974-3984Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar and as given in Equation 4, where α is the intercept of the native (N) and denatured (D) states; β is the slope of the native (N) and denatured (D) states; U50% is the urea concentration at the mid-point of denaturation; m is the slope of the transition between the native and denatured states; R is the gas constant, 1.987 cal·mol-1·K-1; and T the temperature in K. The curves were fitted by nonlinear regression with SigmaPlot 10.0 in Windows. The term mU50% in Equation 4 is equal to the free energy of denaturation in the absence of urea, ΔGUN. In the case of a three-state unfolding process, Equation 5 is as follows, where αI is the intercept of the intermediate state, and βI is the slope of the intermediate state, with Ua50% and Ub50% representing the urea concentrations at mid-denaturation for the first and second transitions, respectively. NMR Spectroscopy-The NMR samples contained 0.5 mm uniformly 15N-labeled wild type R23 or mutated R23 dissolved in 90% H2O, 10% D2O, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0. All the spectra were recorded at 303 K on a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance cryoprobe (1H, 13C, 15N). The heteronuclear experiments were conducted on 15N-labeled protein obtained by expression in minimum media in the presence of 15N-labeled ammonium chloride. Purification was performed in the same way as the unlabeled protein. Using standard Bruker sequence, HSQC spectra were recorded in phase-sensitive mode in both dimensions using echo-anti-echo TPPI gradient selection. 1H-15N HSQC spectra were acquired with 16 transients, with spectral windows of 16/32 ppm in the proton/nitrogen dimensions and the carrier set at the water frequency and 118 ppm, respectively. The relaxation delay used was 0.8 s. Spectra were processed with Topspin or NMRpipe/NMRdraw (34Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11626) Google Scholar) and visualized with Topspin or NMRview (35Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2685) Google Scholar) on a Linux station. A matrix of 2K × 256 points was acquired and zero-filled to 2K × 1K points after apodization by shifted sine-square multiplication and linear prediction in the F1 domain. Refolding Kinetics by Stopped-flow Fluorescence Spectroscopy-Stopped-flow data were recorded on a BioLogic SFM-3, MOS-250 instrument (Grenoble, France). The dead time of the stopped-flow device was 2.2 ms. For refolding measurements, stock solutions of 8 m urea-treated proteins were prepared for 2 h in TNE buffer. The refolding reaction was initiated at 25 °C by 10-fold dilution of the urea-treated protein in TNE buffer. The final protein concentrations were 0.2 μm. The time-dependent fluorescence of tryptophan changes were monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 295 and 345 nm, respectively. Curves were derived from the averages of at least 10 individual kinetic data points after subtraction of the background urea buffer signal. By using Biokine software (BioLogic), the experimental results were fitted with exponential functions to obtain the rate constants. Structure Calculation-Individual residues were assigned to the “a” to “g” positions within the heptads proposed by Winder (28Winder S.J. Gibson T.J. Kendrick-Jones J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) in predicted hydrophobic repeats. The fold recognition program mGenTHREADER (36Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 797-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 37McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2773) Google Scholar) was run to detect the best templates for comparative modeling. The alignment proposed by mGenTHREADER is consistent with the pattern proposed by Winder et al. (28Winder S.J. Gibson T.J. Kendrick-Jones J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and Kusunoki et al. (38Kusunoki H. MacDonald R. Mondragon A. Structure (Lond.). 2004; 12: 645-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) with respect to the heptad motifs conserved in the spectrin repeats. Secondary structure predictions were performed by means of PSIPRED (39Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4497) Google Scholar), incorporating four feed-forward neural networks that analyze the output obtained from PSI-BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Homology models of wild type and mutated R23 proteins were built using MODELLER 9.2 software (40Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10632) Google Scholar). MODELLER is a program based on satisfaction of spatial restraints generated on the target sequence using its alignment with the three-dimensional structure of the templates. Additional restraints were fixed in compliance with the secondary structure prediction of PSIPRED. The loop modeling protocol of MODELLER 9.2 (41Fiser A. Do R.K. Sali A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1753-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar) was used to refine all loops of the selected model. Starting with random conformations, 20 structures were built up for each loop. The generated structures were assessed using MODELLER output as well as additional evaluations; the PROCHECK program was used to assess the stereochemical quality of the structures (42Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4469) Google Scholar), supplemented by the following profile programs: ProSA-WEB (43Wiederstein M. Sippl M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W407-W410Crossref PubMed Scopus (3568) Google Scholar); the web-based version of ProSA (44Sippl M.J. J. Comput. Aided Mol.

Biol. 1998; 277: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar); and by examination on a graphic display. A representative model was selected and its energy minimized with the SYBYL software (TRIPOS Inc., St Louis, MO). The secondary structures of the model were analyzed and represented with the PyMOL program (Delano Scientific). Hydrophobic and electrostatic potentials on the molecular surfaces were calculated using the rTools (Kristian Rother) and Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) (48Baker R.D. Lifetime Data Anal. 2001; 7: 65-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) software packages, respectively, implemented in PyMOL. Protein Characterization-Fig. 1 shows the amino acid sequence of the R23 repeat of human dystrophin, along with the predicted secondary structure and alignment with the sequence of the repeat 16 from chicken brain α-spectrin R16-17 (Protein Data Bank code 1cun) (49Grum V.L. Li D. MacDonald R.I. Mondragon A. Cell. 1999; 98: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), which is the template selected for molecular modeling. According to Winder’s heptad-based alignment (28Winder S.J. Gibson T.J. Kendrick-Jones J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the Glu → Val and Asn → Asp mutations in positions 2910 and 2912 of human dystrophin in R23 are located in helix C of the triple helix coiled-coil, at positions “c” and “e” of the respective heptad. Wild type and mutated R23 were obtained in comparable purity, as verified by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 2A). Mass spectrometry analysis (INRA, Rennes, France) yields the expected molecular weight for wild type and mutated R23. Analytical size exclusion chromatography reveals that the four proteins are monomeric and monodisperse, with identical Stokes’ radii of 2.4 nm (data not shown) (20Legardinier S. Hubert J.F. Le Bihan O. Tascon C. Rocher C. Raguenes-Nicol C. Bondon A. Hardy S. Le Rumeur E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). f/f0 values of 1.40 are compatible with the shape of coiled-coil single repeats. We conclude that neither the single nor the double mutation E2910V/N2912D induces self-aggregation or measurable variations in the frictional coefficient of the protein. Circular dichroism spectra (Fig. 2B) display the typical features of proteins with a predominant α-helix folding as expected for dystrophin repeats (16Le Rumeur E. Fichou Y. Pottier S. Gaboriau F.

https://openalex.org/W1977280665,"Background We have previously described a RAF oncogene driven transgenic mouse model for non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here we examine whether tumor initiation and growth requires the stem cell self-renewal factor Bmi1. Principal Findings In order to evaluate Bmi1 function in NSCLC two founder lines that differ in incidence and latency of tumor formation were compared. Ablation of Bmi1 expression in both lines had a dramatically decreased tumor growth. As the line with shorter latency matched the life span of Bmi1 knock out mice, these mice were chosen for further study. The absence of Bmi1 did not decrease the number of tumor initiation in these mice as only the size and not the number of tumors decreased. Reduction in tumor growth resulted from an increase in cell death and decrease in cell cycle progression that corresponded with up-regulation of the p16INK4a and p19ARF. Significance The data identifies Bmi1 as an important factor for expansion but not initiation of RAF driven NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2025389845,"Exposure to estrogens increases the risk of breast and endometrial cancer. It is proposed that the estrogen receptor (ER) may contribute to estrogen carcinogenesis by transduction of the hormonal signal and as a “Trojan horse” concentrating genotoxic estrogen metabolites in the nucleus to complex with DNA, enhancing DNA damage. 4-Hydroxyequilenin (4-OHEN), the major catechol metabolite of equine estrogens present in estrogen replacement formulations, autoxidizes to a redox-cycling quinone that has been shown to cause DNA damage. 4-OHEN was found to be an estrogen of nanomolar potency in cell culture using a luciferase reporter assay and, using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, was found to activate ERα binding to estrogen-responsive genes in MCF-7 cells. DNA damage was measured in cells by comparing ERα(+) versus ERα(-) cells and 4-OHEN versus menadione, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating, but non-estrogenic, quinone. 4-OHEN selectively induced DNA damage in ERα(+) cells, whereas menadione-induced damage was not dependent on cellular ER status. The rate of 4-OHEN-induced DNA damage was significantly enhanced in ERα(+) cells, whereas ER status had no effect on the rate of menadione-induced damage. Imaging of ROS induced by 4-OHEN showed accumulation selective for the nucleus of ERα(+) cells within 5 min, whereas in ERα(-) or menadione-treated cells, no selectivity was observed. These data support ERα acting as a Trojan horse concentrating 4-OHEN in the nucleus to accelerate the rate of ROS generation and thereby amplify DNA damage. The Trojan horse mechanism may be of general importance beyond estrogen genotoxins. Exposure to estrogens increases the risk of breast and endometrial cancer.

An increased relative risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women is strongly linked to several endocrine-related risk factors. One of these risk factors is long-term exposure to hormone or estrogen replacement therapy (HRT 3The abbreviations used are: HRT, hormone replacement therapy; ERT, estrogen replacement therapy; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CM-DCF, 5-(and 6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein; CM-H2DCFDA, 5-(and 6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester; COMT, catechol-O-methyltransferase; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; E2, 17β-estradiol; ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen-responsive element; 4-MeOEN, 4-methoxy equilenin; NAC, N-acteylcysteine; 4-OHTAM, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; 4-OHEN, 4-hydroxyequilenin; 8-oxo-dG, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine; ROS, reactive oxygen species; MEM, minimum essential medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy. or ERT). The most widely prescribed formulations in the United States contain conjugated human estrogens and B-ring unsaturated conjugated equine estrogens, the latter constituting approximately half of the estrogen content of these formulations (1Li J.J.

The equine estrogen equilenin is of special interest as a carcinogen because: 1) it is selectively oxidized to the more genotoxic 4-hydroxy catechol isomer (4-OHEN); and 2) 4-OHEN autoxidizes to a redox-cycling o-quinone without need for cytochrome P450 catalysis (27Zhang F.

The estrogen receptor (ER) may play two key roles in mediating estrogen carcinogenesis: transduction of the hormonal signal and transport of genotoxic estrogen metabolites to the nucleus to complex with DNA. In the latter role, ER acts as a “Trojan horse,” enhancing DNA damage. This hypothesis is persuasive for 4-OHEN because this catechol readily autoxidizes and redox cycles, theoretically generating large fluxes of ROS in the cell nucleus. However, 4-OHEN is autoxidized to a reactive quinone electrophile known to be trapped readily by glutathione and protein nucleophiles. It is not clear from previous work whether 4-OHEN represents a good ER ligand. Furthermore, the Trojan horse hypothesis has obvious weaknesses in that 4-OHEN may be trapped in the cytoplasm and may not be able to redox cycle as part of an ER-DNA complex. To test the hypothesis, the hormonal estrogenicity of 4-OHEN was assayed using cellular reporters; a comparison was made between ERα-positive and -negative cells testing 4-OHEN-induced DNA damage; a comparison was made with the ROS-generating, but non-estrogenic, quinone, menadione; and finally, nuclear localization of 4-OHEN and generation of ROS was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and fluorescence confocal microscopy. The Trojan horse model may be of general importance in the study of environmental estrogen genotoxins and the nuclear concentration of genotoxins by other nuclear receptors and transcription factors. The catechol estrogens were handled in accordance with NIH Guidelines for the Laboratory Use of Chemical Carcinogens (35National Institutes of Health NIH Guidelines for the Laboratory Use of Chemical Carcinogens. U. S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C.1981Google Scholar). Materials-All chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher Scientific unless stated otherwise. 5-(and 6)-Chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate was purchased from Invitrogen. 4-OHEN was synthesized by treating equilin with Fremy’s salt as described previously (36Han X. Liehr J.G. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2571-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (27Zhang F. Chen Y. Pisha E. Shen L. Xiong Y. van Breemen R.B. Bolton J.L. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The comet assay and Fpg FLARE comet assay kits for detection of DNA single strand breaks and oxidized bases were purchased from Trevigen (Gaithersburg, MD). All buffers and reagents used in ChIP assay were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell Culture Conditions-MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin-fungizome, 6 μg/liter insulin, 1% GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 5% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta), and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The S30 cell line, a stable ERα transfectant of the MDA-MB-231 cell line, was a generous gift from Dr. V. C. Jordan (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia). The S30 cells were maintained in phenol red-free MEM supplemented with the same solution as the MDA-MB-231 cells except for the addition of 5% charcoal-dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and 500 μg/ml Geneticin. The MCF-7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin-fungizome, 6 μg/liter insulin, and 1% GlutaMAX. The MCF-7:K1 cell line, a clonal derivative of MCF-7 cells, was a kind gift from Dr. J. Frasor (University of Illinois at Chicago) and was maintained in MEM supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin-fungizome, 25 μg/ml gentamicin, 2 mm glutamine, 5% calf bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, Utah), and 2 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate solution. Estrogen-free medium for MCF-7:K1 cells was prepared by supplementing charcoal-dextran-treated fetal bovine serum to phenol red-free MEM, whereas other components remained the same except omitting gentamicin. Transient Transfection and ERE-Luciferase Assays-Briefly, MCF-7 cells were cultured in estrogen-free media for 4 days before transfection. The cells were transfected with 2 μg of the pERE-luciferase plasmid, which contains three copies of the Xenopus laevis vitellogenin A2 ERE upstream of firefly luciferase. To normalize transfection efficiency, 1 μg of pRL-TK plasmid, which contained a cDNA encoding Renilla luciferase, was co-transfected with ERE-luciferase plasmid. Cells (4 × 105 cells/well) were transfected with ERE-luciferase, pretreated with or without 10 μm Ro-41-0960 (COMT inhibitor) for 24 h, and then treated with DMSO (0.05%), menadione (100 nm, 1 μm), E2 (1 nm), or 4-OHEN (100 nm) with or without 10 μm COMT inhibitor for 18 h. The luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured using the Dual-Luciferase assay system from Promega (Madison, WI) with a FLUOstar OPTIMA (BMG Labtech, Durham, NC). Data are reported as relative luciferase activity (firefly luciferase reading divided by the Renilla luciferase reading). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay-Cells were cultured in estrogen-free media for 4 days before treatment with compounds. Cells were treated with DMSO, E2, or 4-OHEN for 45 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and cross-linked with 1.5% formaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, collected into lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 1× protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science)), and sonicated 20 times for 10 s at 10% strength (Fisher Model 300 Sonic Dismembrator) followed by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Each sample was reserved for the inputs prior to immunoprecipitation. Supernatants were collected and diluted in immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) containing 1× protease inhibitor followed by immunoclearing with 8 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA and protein A-agarose slurry (40 μl of 50% slurry in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA)) for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 1 min, immunoprecipitation was performed by gently mixing the supernatants with the antibodies against ERα (3.3 μg/ml, HC-20) or IgG (3.3 μg/ml, normal rabbit IgG) overnight at 4 °C. After immunoprecipitation, protein A-agarose slurry (40 μl) containing 8 μg of salmon sperm DNA was added, and the incubation was continued for another 2 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were obtained by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 1 min and washed sequentially for 5 min each in TSE I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), TSE II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), and LiCl buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). Precipitates were then washed three times with TE buffer, and DNA was extracted three times with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. Eluates were pooled and heated at 65 °C for 16 h to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking. DNA fragments were purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The subsequent PCR experiment was performed to detect DNA fragments of estrogen sensitive-gene, such as the ERE sequence. The pS2-ERE forward and reverse primer sequences, from -4919 to -4806 (5′ to 3′), were GACGGAATGGGCTTCATGA and AGTGAGAGATGGCCGGAAAA, respectively. The pS2 upstream forward and reverse primer sequences (5′ to 3′), spanning the -446 to -339 region of the pS2 promoter, were GGGTCTCAGTGGTGGCAGTA and ACCGCTCATACCATCCAGTC, respectively. Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis Assay (Comet Assay)-The comet assay (37Singh N.P. McCoy M.T. Tice R.R. Schneider E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (8975) Google Scholar) was carried out as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, after cells (1.5 × 105 cells/ml) were treated with various concentrations of test compounds, the attached cells were trypsinized, combined with suspended cells, and washed twice with chilled PBS, pH 7.4 (Ca2+- and Mg2+-free; Trevigen). The cell suspension was combined with 0.5% low melting agarose, and the mixture was immediately placed onto a CometSlide. The slides were incubated at 4 °C in the dark for gelling before immersion in prechilled lysis solution for 30 min at 4 °C and then incubated in freshly prepared alkali (pH > 13) solution for 45 min. The assay was adapted for measurement at earlier time points by quenching with excess N-acetylcysteine (NAC; 10 mm) for 1 min. As described above, cells were washed with cold PBS, trypsinized, and collected by centrifugation. The cells were further washed with cold PBS and collected by centrifugation. PBS (2 ml) was added to produce a suspension that was mixed with low melting agarose, placed on glass slides, and then incubated at 4 °C for 10 min in the dark. Alkali solution electrophoresis was performed for 10 min at 300 mA and 1 V/cm, and then the slides were immersed in prechilled 70% ethanol for 5 min and air-dried. The slides were then stained with SYBR Green and scored under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Y-FL). The DNA damage from at least 100 cells/slide was scored in arbitrary units from 0 (intact DNA) to 4 (completely damaged DNA with tail only) (38Collins A.R. Dobson V.L. Dusinska M. Kennedy G. Stetina R. Mutat. Res. 1997; 375: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Scores were calculated using Equation 1 in which NA (intact DNA) and NB - NE (completely damaged DNA) were the number of different kinds of comets. Score(S)=(NB+2NC+3ND+4NE)/(NA+NB+NC+ND+NE)×100Eq. 1 Modified Oxidative DNA Damage Comet Assay (Fpg FLARE Comet Assay)-Oxidized bases were determined using the Trevigen Fpg FLARE (fragment length analysis using repair enzymes) comet assay kit. Briefly, following treatment the cells were collected and washed as described previously and resuspended in PBS. The cell suspensions were combined with low melting agarose and transferred onto CometSlides. After fixing the cell/agar mixture to the slide at 4 °C, the cells were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer for 30 min. After equilibration with FLARE buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.1 m KCl) for 15 min, the slides were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min with the diluted Fpg enzyme, and appropriate buffer-only controls were included. Following equilibration with alkali solution, the slides underwent electrophoresis for 3 min at 300 mA. The slides were then fixed with 70% ethanol, stained with SYBR Green, and scored as described above using Equation 1. The difference between the scores of the Fpg-treated samples and buffer controls was proportional to the amount of oxidized bases in the cells. Analysis of 8-Oxo-dG in Breast Cancer Cells by LC-MS/MS-8-Oxo-dG analysis was carried out as described previously (31Liu X. Yao J. Pisha E. Yang Y. Hua Y. van Breemen R.B. Bolton J.L. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. After incubation with test compounds, the floating cells were collected by centrifugation, and the attached cells were trypsinized and then harvested by centrifugation. The cells were combined and washed with 10 ml of PBS. After centrifugation, the cell pellets were homogenized in 3.5 ml of lysis buffer (320 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Triton X-100, and 50 mm mannitol). The nuclei pellets were treated for 30 min at 37 °C with RNase T1 (1000 units) and RNase A (0.2 mg) in solution buffer (1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.45 m NaCl) and further incubated with proteinase K (0.8 mg) for 30 min at 37 °C. NaCl and Tris were added to achieve final concentrations of 0.62 m and 20 mm, respectively. An equal volume of 1-butanol was added, the samples were thoroughly mixed and centrifuged, and the bottom aqueous layer was isolated. After isopropanol precipitation, the DNA was washed twice with 70% ethanol. The DNA was dissolved in 100 μl of buffer (25 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.3, 0.1 mm ZnCl2), mixed with 2 μl of 10 mm Desferral, and hydrolyzed using nuclease P1 (4 units) and alkaline phosphatase (8 units) for 30 min at 37 °C. The enzymes were removed by ultrafiltration using a Microcon YM-30 centrifugal filter (Millipore). Stable isotopically labeled [15N5]8-oxo-dG was added to the ultrafiltrate as the surrogate standard, and the mixture was analyzed using LC-MS/MS on a Thermo (San Jose, CA) TSQ Quantum triple quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled with a Surveyor HPLC System and photodiode array detector. The samples were separated using a YMC (YMC Co., Wilmington, NC) AQ C18 column (2.0 × 250 mm) and guard column (4.0 × 20 mm) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with a gradient mobile phase starting at 5% methanol/water and increasing to 10% methanol over 6 min, increasing to 20% methanol/water over another 6 min, increasing to 90% methanol/water for 5 min, and then equilibrium with 5% methanol/water for 15 min in one step. The native dG was determined by UV scanning from 240 nm to 290 nm. The 8-oxo-dG was detected using selected reaction monitoring and collision-induced dissociation for the fragmentation pathway of m/z 282 → 192 with a dwell time of 0.5 s/ion using negative ion electrospray (39Hua Y. Wainhaus S.B. Yang Y. Shen L. Xiong Y. Xu X. Zhang F. Bolton J.L. van Breemen R.B. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 12: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Determination of ROS by CM-H2DCFDA-Both S30 and MDA-MB-231 cells were grown (106 cells/ml) on each of eight wells on a sterile Nunc™ chambered coverglass and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in phenol red-free MEM supplemented with 10% stripped fetal bovine serum medium. S30 and MDA-MB-231 cells were labeled with 10 μm CM-H2DCFDA for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2 (40LeBel C.P. Ischiropoulos H. Bondy S.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar, 41Ubezio P. Civoli F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). CM-H2DCFDA-treated cells were rinsed twice with PBS to remove the unincorporated dye, and 0.2 μg/ml Hoechst stain was added to the cells to detect nuclear staining. The cells were then treated with 4-OHEN (1 μm), menadione (1 μm), or DMSO (0.5%) for 5 min, and imaging was performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope with the detector gain adjusted to eliminate the background autofluorescence. The fluorescence signal from CM-H2DCFDA was monitored with a 488 nm argon/krypton laser and a 530 nm band pass filter. The Hoechst nuclear staining signal was monitored with a 345 nm UV laser and 420 nm band pass filter. A ×63 (1.2 numerical aperture) water immersion objective was used for all experiments. Images were analyzed using the analysis tool provided in the Zeiss biophysical software package. Statistical Analyses-ERE-luciferase assays and comet and FLARE comet studies were performed three times, and the results of 8-oxo-dG measurement using LC-MS/MS were obtained from two separate experiments. All data were expressed as the mean ± S.D. The statistical analysis of these results consisted of one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett’s or Tukey’s multiple comparison tests using GraphPad Prism version 4 for Windows. 4-OHEN Is a Poor Ligand for the Isolated ER but an Estrogen of Nanomolar Potency in Cell Culture-The first question to address was the estrogenicity of 4-OHEN in ERα-positive cells. Previous reports have shown low affinity in the radioligand competitive binding assay to recombinant full-length ERα, with significant variance probably because of the instability of 4-OHEN: IC50 = 1.5 ± 0.2 μm (31Liu X. Yao J. Pisha E. Yang Y. Hua Y. van Breemen R.B. Bolton J.L. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 42Liu X. Pisha E. Tonetti D.A. Yao D. Li Y. Yao J. Burdette J.E. Bolton J.L. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 16: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, binding to ER by 4-methoxy equilenin (4-MeOEN), the product of COMT action on 4-OHEN, was not even detectable under the same assay conditions (43Chang M. Peng K.W. Kastrati I. Overk C.R. Qin Z.H. Yao P. Bolton J.L. Thatcher G.R. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 4793-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, 4-MeOEN was observed to be an estrogen agonist in both ERα(+) Ishikawa (EC50 = 0.16 ± 0.1 nm) and MCF-7 cells (EC50 = 6.5 ± 0.6 nm) (43Chang M. Peng K.W. Kastrati I. Overk C.R. Qin Z.H. Yao P. Bolton J.L. Thatcher G.R. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 4793-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Similarly, 4-OHEN was observed to be an agonist with nanomolar potency (EC50 = 5.7 ± 2.8 nm) as measured in ERα(+) MCF-7 cells transiently transfected with an ERE-luciferase reporter vector and treated for 18 h with test compound. As expected, co-administration of the selective estrogen receptor modulator 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHTAM) or the pure estrogen antagonist ICI 182,780 inhibited the estrogenic activity of 4-OHEN (Fig. 1). As 4-MeOEN has been shown to be an estrogen of nanomolar potency, it was necessary to rule out COMT-mediated methylation of 4-OHEN as the cause of estrogenicity using the COMT inhibitor Ro-41-0960 (Fig. 1). Finally, menadione was confirmed to be devoid of estrogenic or antiestrogenic activity. 4-OHEN Binding Causes Translocation of ERα to the Nucleus of MCF-7 Cells-Although 4-OHEN is a full and potent estrogen, multiple mechanisms of nonclassical estrogenic signaling are being revealed involving membrane-associated ER (44Pedram A. Razandi M. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 1996-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Both 4-MeOEN and 4-OHEN are reported to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase at 5 min in MCF-7 cells, a target for rapid membrane-associated ER-mediated response (43Chang M. Peng K.W. Kastrati I. Overk C.R. Qin Z.H. Yao P. Bolton J.L. Thatcher G.R. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 4793-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore it was deemed essential to demonstrate that activity resulted from nuclear localization and binding to DNA of 4-OHEN-liganded ERα.

Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry revealed a G2/M block in isc1Δ cells when treated with methyl methanesulfonate or HU. Further investigation revealed that the levels of Cdc28 phosphorylated on Tyr-19, which plays an essential role in the regulation of the G2/M checkpoint, were higher in synchronized and asynchronous cells lacking ISC1 in response to HU. Use of a Cdc28-Y19F mutant protected isc1Δ from the G2/M block. In wild type cells, HU induced a loss of the Swe1p kinase, the enzyme that phosphorylates Cdc28-Tyr-19, correlating with resumption of the cell cycle. In the isc1Δ cells, however, the levels of Swe1p remained at sustained high levels in response to HU. Significantly, deletion of SWE1 in an isc1Δ background overcame the G2/M block in response to HU. The double isc1Δ/swe1Δ mutant also overcame the growth defect on HU. Taken together, these findings implicate Isc1p as an upstream regulator of Swe1p levels and stability and Cdc28-Tyr-19 phosphorylation, in effect signaling recovery from the effects of genotoxic stress and allowing G2/M progression.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ISC1 (inositol phosphosphingolipase C) is the homologue of the mammalian neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase 2). These enzymes catalyze the degradation of complex phospho-sphingolipids to produce phytoceramide/dihydroceramide in yeast and ceramide/dihydroceramide in mammals (1Matmati N. Hannun Y.A. J.

A genome-wide screen revealed that ISC1 deletion (isc1Δ) mutants were sensitive to the DNA alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and to the DNA replication blocking drug hydroxyurea (HU) (7Chang M. Bellaoui M. Boone C. Brown G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16934-16939Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, the role of ISC1 in protecting cells from MMS or HU and its mechanism have not been investigated.MMS is a carcinogen that methylates DNA on N7- and N3-deoxyguanine (8Lawley P.D. Mutat.

Cancer Investig. 1984; 2: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). HU is a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor that blocks the synthesis of DNA. Yeast cells treated with HU activate the S phase checkpoint, and cells arrest in early S phase (11Eklund H. Uhlin U. Farnegardh M. Logan D.T. Nordlund P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 177-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 12Koc A. Wheeler L.J. Mathews C.K. Merrill G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 223-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). After a few hours in the presence of HU, WT cells resume cell division, overcoming the S phase block.In this study, we investigate the mechanism and role of ISC1 in the response to HU. Cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry showed unexpectedly that deletion of ISC1 resulted in an additional and subsequent block in the G2/M phase in the presence of MMS or HU. The G2 phase progression into M phase is regulated by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28p (Cdk2 in mammals). Cdc28p is an essential regulator of the cell cycle in the yeast S. cerevisiae (13Bloom J. Cross F.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 14Mendenhall M.D. Hodge A.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1191-1243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its activity is dependent on the binding of a cyclin subunit. During the different phases of cell cycle progression, Cdc28p is coupled with different cyclins. There are two classes of Cdc28 cyclins, G1 and B type cyclins: three G1 cyclins (cln1 to cln3) and six B-type cyclins (clb1 to clb6). The CDC28 kinase activity is under multiple complex controls, and kinase activity is required for both initiation of DNA replication and G2/M transition (15Fitch I. Dahmann C. Surana U. Amon A.

Cell. 1991; 65: 145-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Activation of the G2/M checkpoint is achieved through the inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc28 at Tyr-19 when Cdc28p is complexed with Clb2 cyclin (21Lew D.J. Reed S.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 739-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), which is regulated by the Swe1 kinase, the S. cerevisiae homologue of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Wee1 (22Booher R.N. Deshaies R.J. Kirschner M.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3417-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The action of Swe1 on Cdc28 is cyclin-specific; it phosphorylates Clb2-Cdc28 but not Cln2-Cdc28 (22Booher R.N. Deshaies R.J. Kirschner M.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3417-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar).This study shows that loss of Isc1p results in activation of the G2/M checkpoint as revealed by the increased phosphorylation of Cdc28 on Tyr-19 following HU treatment. The Swe1 kinase was found to have a crucial role in isc1Δ sensitivity to HU, and the levels of Swe1p were increased and remained high for several hours following treatment with HU in an ISC1-dependent manner. The role of Swe1p was confirmed by deletion studies, which showed that the double mutant isc1Δ/swe1Δ was protected form HU toxicity. These studies reveal an unexpected G2/M checkpoint in response to HU and role for Isc1p in negotiating this checkpoint.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Media-The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are: JK9-3d (MATa trp1 leu2-3 his4 ura3 ade2 rme1), Jk9-3d isc1Δ (MATa trp1 leu2-3 his4 ura3 ade2 rme1 isc1Δ::KanMX) from our laboratory (23Sawai H.

ISC1 was deleted in JMY 1469 strains to obtain JMY 1469 isc1Δ using the following primers (forward, 5′-TCCGAAAATGCGTCTATGCT-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGGTTACGGTGGGTCTTCAA-3′) to amplify the ISC1 locus containing KanMX sequence from a genomic DNA of JK9-3d isc1Δ. The PCR product was transformed into JMY 1469, and we then selected for G418-resistant cells (yeast lithium acetate transformation methods). The deletion of ISC1 was verified by PCR and sequencing to confirm the replacement of ISC1 locus by KanMX sequence. Strains were grown on liquid or solid Yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) or on Synthetic minimum dextrose without leucine (SD-Leu). HU (U. S. Biologicals) was added to YPD at the concentration of 10 mg/ml and to SD-Leu at 7.5 mg/ml. All cells were grown at 30 °C. SWE1 was deleted using primers (forward primer, 5′ GTATGCGTGTGTTAACTATCCTGC 3′, and reverse primer, 5′ AAACTCATCTAAGGTTTTACATGG 3′) to amplify the deleted locus from strain DLY 690 Mat a cdc24-1 swe1Δ::LEU2 bar1 (ade his2 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 ura3Δns) received from Dr. Daniel Lew (24McMillan J.N.

The PCR product was used to transform JK9-3d isc1Δ, and transformants were selected on SD-Leu. The deletion of SWE1 gene was verified by PCR.Plasmids-We received a plasmid expressing Cdc28-Y19F as a kind gift from Dr. George F. Sprague (25Mitchell D.A. Sprague Jr., G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were transformed with the plasmid expressing the mutated Cdc28 or with vector control pRS415.Cell Cycle Analysis-Asynchronous MATa (JK9-3d and Jk9-3d isc1Δ) cells were grown to logarithmic phase on YPD or SD-Leu to an A600 of 0.3. Half of the culture was transferred to flasks containing 10 mg/ml or 7.5 mg/ml HU, and the other half served as untreated control. Aliquots were taken for Western blot studies, and others were fixed in 70% ethanol in 0.2 m TE, pH 7.5, and stored at 4 °C. For subsequent fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, the fixed cells were centrifuged, the supernatant (ethanol) was discarded, cells were resuspended in 200 μl, 1 mg/ml RNase in 0.2 m TE, pH 7.5, and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. The cells were resuspended in 10 μl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K in 0.2 m TE, pH 7.5, and then incubated at 50 °C for more than 2 h. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 0.2 m TE, pH 7.8, containing 4 μg/ml of propidium iodide, left for a few hours at 4 °C, and then taken for FACS analysis.To obtain cells in the G2/M phase, we treated the cells with α-factor 5 mg/ml (U. S. Biologicals), washed them, and then released them in nocodazole (Sigma) or in nocodazole + HU. Aliquots were taken for Western blot analysis at appropriate time points.Western Blot Analysis-Cell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer containing TE, EDTA, and proteinase inhibitors followed by the addition of cold glass beads. The tubes were vortexed for 3 min at 4 °C and then placed on ice for 1 min. This cycle was repeated a total of five times to obtain the whole cell lysate. The tubes were then centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 6000 rpm. The supernatant was transferred to new tubes, and the protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Sixty micrograms of proteins were loaded onto 4–20% Tris-HCl gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, both from Bio-Rad. The membranes were blocked, and immunoblotting was performed using a phosphoCdc2 (Tyr-15) antibody (Cell Signaling) that recognizes yeast Cdc-28 when phosphorylated at Tyr-19. Anti-Swe1 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Swe1 (y-311): sc-7171). We used anti-myc antibody to detect Swe1-myc in the time course experiment done with synchronized cells. The Pstaire antibody (recognizing a conserved PSTAIRE domain of Cdc2 p34) was used in all the westerns as a loading control.Statistical Analysis-The specific statistical methods and the number of replicates for each experiment are indicated in all figure legends.RESULTSISC1 Deletion Renders Cells Sensitive to Genotoxic Agents-In a genome-wide screen for MMS sensitivity, ISC1 deletion increased the sensitivity of the cells to MMS as well as to HU (7Chang M. Bellaoui M. Boone C. Brown G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16934-16939Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). To confirm these results, we investigated the sensitivity of the yeast strain JK9-3d and isc1Δ to three types of genotoxic agents: MMS, HU, and camptothecin. On a spot test shown in Fig. 1, isc1Δ showed clear sensitivity to MMS and HU and partial sensitivity to camptothecin. These results raised important questions as to the role and molecular mechanisms that connect an enzyme involved in the degradation of complex sphingolipids to survival in the presence of a genotoxic drug.HU Induces a G2/M Block in isc1Δ Cells-Because isc1Δ showed sensitivity to HU treatment, it was important at the outset to determine whether the progression of the cell cycle in the mutant cells was any different from the WT. A time course FACS analysis was performed in WT and isc1Δ, untreated and treated with HU, 10 mg/ml. The results of these experiments, shown in Fig. 2, reveal no differences in the progression of the cell cycle in the absence of HU (Fig. 2, A and B). When cells were treated with HU, both WT and isc1Δ exhibited a characteristic G1/S phase arrest in response to HU following the first 2 h of treatment (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, ISC1 does not appear to be involved in the initial response to HU. On the other hand, the cell cycle profile became distinct between WT and isc1Δ after a few hours of treatment with HU as isc1Δ cells accumulated substantially in the G2/M phase, whereas the WT cells progressed normally out of the S phase block (Fig. 2, E and F). Thus, cell cycle analysis demonstrated an unexpected G2/M block in response to HU revealed through the deletion of ISC1.FIGURE 2Cell cycle progression analysis by flow cytometry (FACS) of asynchronous WT and isc1Δ cells in response to HU and MMS. All cells were grown to reach an A600 of 0.4; this was considered the start of the time course (point 0). An aliquot of cells was taken at the indicated times, and analyzed by FACS. A and B, WT (A) and mutant cells (B). The same analysis is shown in WT cells (C) and isc1Δ cells (D) after 90 min of HU (10 mg/ml) treatment. E and F, WT (E) and isc1Δ (F) treated with HU (10 mg/ml) for an extended time. G and H, asynchronous WT (G) and isc1Δ (H) cells response to MMS. WT and mutant isc1Δ cells grown as described above were treated with MMS (0.002% (v/v)). Analyses in A, B, E, and F were repeated three times, and standard deviation error bars are shown for each time point. Analyses in C, D, G, and H were repeated two times, and the results represent the mean of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the G2/M phase block was due to the HU treatment specifically or in response to genotoxicity, the effects of MMS on the cell cycle in WT and isc1Δ cells were evaluated. The results showed that MMS treatment had the same effect as HU on isc1Δ cells; the G2/M block was evident at 8–12 h in isc1Δ (Fig. 2H) when compared with WT cells, which resume cycling (Fig. 2G). These results indicated that the G2/M block is not specific to HU. Thus, the S phase checkpoint resulting from HU treatment is not specifically involved in the successive G2/M block in isc1Δ.Phosphorylation Status of Cdc28 Kinase in isc1Δ+/– HU-Next, studies were undertaken to determine the mechanism of this G2/M block. Initially, the phosphorylation of Cdc28 at Tyr-19 (Cdc28-Tyr-19-Pi) was evaluated as a measure of its activation status, employing an anti-phospho-Cdk2-Tyr-15 antibody that recognizes yeast Cdc28-Tyr-19-Pi. In Fig. 3A, a time course Western blot of asynchronous cultures showed that the levels of Cdc28-Tyr-19-Pi were higher in isc1Δ when compared with WT in the presence of HU. To more specifically evaluate the phosphorylation status of Cdc28-Tyr-19 at G2/M phase, both WT and isc1Δ were synchronized using α-factor and then released in medium containing nocodazole alone or nocodazole and HU. Nocodazole blocks the cells at G2 phase where normally Cdc28-Tyr-19-Pi is low. As shown in Fig. 3B, Cdc28-Tyr-19-Pi levels increased in both strains but persisted in the isc1Δ strain, and the effects were much more pronounced following treatment with HU (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that the G2/M checkpoint regulator Cdc28 was significantly inactivated by phosphorylation in response to HU in isc1Δ cells.FIGURE 3Role of Isc1p in regulating the phosphorylation of Cdc28-Tyr-19. Asynchronous WT and isc1Δ cells were treated with HU for the indicated times, and the levels of phosphorylated Cdc28-Tyr-19 (Cdc28-Y19-Pi) were detected using Cdc2 (Tyr-15) antibody (A). WT and isc1Δ were synchronized using α-factor and then released in YPD medium containing 20 μg/ml nocodazole (B) or nocodazole and HU (C). Nocodazole was added to block the cells in G2/M phase to evaluate the protein levels of phosphorylated Cdc28-Tyr-19. Whole cell proteins were isolated at the indicated times, and the levels of phosphorylated Cdc28-Tyr-19 were detected using Cdc2 (Tyr-15) antibody. Pstaire antibody was used as a loading control. These blots were repeated independently three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further corroborate these results and extend them, we employed a mutated form of Cdc28-Tyr-19, the active Cdc28-Y19F (the tyrosine in position 19 was replaced by a phenylalanine), which cannot be phosphorylated by Swe1p, the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of Cdc28 at the Tyr-19 site. When Cdc28-Y19F was expressed in isc1Δ cells, the G2/M phase block was no longer detected when cells were treated with HU (Fig. 4A). However, the isc1Δ cells containing the vector alone treated with HU showed a G2/M block (Fig. 4B). These results indicate clearly that the phosphorylation of Cdc28-Tyr-19 is necessary for the G2/M block to occur in cells lacking ISC1 gene in the presence of HU.FIGURE 4Role of phosphoCdc28 in regulating cell cycle response to HU in isc1Δ cells. FACS analysis was performed on isc1Δ cells transformed with either a plasmid expressing a phospho-resistant mutant Cdc28-Y19F gene (A) or a vector control (B). The results represent the average of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Swe1 Kinase Is Implicated in the Sensitivity of isc1Δ to HU-The results revealing higher Cdc28-Tyr-19-Pi in isc1Δ in Fig. 3, A–C, suggested that isc1Δ might have a more active Swe1 kinase. Initially, the levels of Swe1 were evaluated, and for these studies, an anti-myc antibody to Swe1p-myc was employed. The results showed that HU induced a time-dependent decrease in Swe1 in WT cells, which is consistent with the ability of the WT cells to negotiate the G2/M checkpoint (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, the elevated levels of Swe1 persisted longer in isc1Δ cells in the presence of HU. The levels of Swe1 were also evaluated in α-factor synchronized cultures released in nocodazole to synchronize the cells primarily in the G2 phase when usually the levels of Swe1p are very low (Fig. 5B). Again, it was found that Swe1 levels failed to down-regulate in isc1Δ cells in response to HU (Fig. 5C). These results demonstrate that HU-treated cells require a drop in Swe1 levels to negotiate the G2/M checkpoint and that this occurs in an Isc1-dependent manner.FIGURE 5Effect of isc1Δ on the levels of Swe1p. Asynchronous WT and isc1Δ cells were treated with HU, whole cell proteins were isolated at the indicated times (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the levels of Swe1p were detected using c-myc antibody for myc-taged Swe1p (A). WT and isc1Δ were synchronized using α-factor and then released in YPD medium containing 20 μg/ml nocodazole (B) or nocodazole and HU 10 mg/ml (C). Pstaire antibody was used as loading control. These blots were repeated independently three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, the role of Swe1p in mediating the effects of ISC1 deletion on the G2/M check point were evaluated using a deletion of SWE1 because the loss of Swe1p should cause less phosphorylation of clb2-Cdc28-Tyr-19, resulting in an unphosphorylated active form of the cyclin-dependent kinase. FACS analysis was performed in the isc1Δ/swe1Δ double mutant, and the results showed that loss of expression of the SWE1 gene was sufficient to overcome the G2/M block after HU treatment (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, a spot test was performed to determine whether the deletion of the SWE1 gene would rescue the viability of isc1Δ on HU. The results showed that the double deletion isc1Δ/swe1Δ rescued growth on HU (Fig. 6B). These results support a mechanism by which Swe1p plays a key role in the G2/M block of isc1Δ in response to HU.FIGURE 6Effect of Swe1 deletion on the G2/M progression and survival of ISC1Δ cells. A, the role of Swe1 in mediating the cell cycle effects of HU in isc1Δ cells. Double mutant isc1Δ/swe1Δ cells were grown as described under “Experimental Procedures,” treated with HU, and harvested at the indicated time points. An aliquot of cells at each time point was analyzed by FACS. B, the role of Swe1 in mediating the growth effects of HU in isc1Δ cells. Exponentially growing WT, swe1Δ, isc1Δ, and isc1Δ/swe1Δ cells were spotted onto agar YPD plates without HU or containing 10 mg/ml HU. The plates were incubated for 3–4 days at 30 °C. C, schematic description of the role of Isc1p in G2/M block in response to HU. In the presence of HU, the levels of Swe1 increase in both strains. Swe1p levels decrease in WT cells, Cdc28p is in an active form, and the G2/M phase progresses normally. When Isc1p is missing, Swe1p levels remain elevated, and isc1Δ cells fail to decrease Swe1 kinase levels. Persistent high levels of Swe1p lead to an increase of phosphorylated Cdc28p (Cdc28p-Pi), which is inactive. The G2/M checkpoint is activated, and cells are blocked in G2/M phase. Experimental analysis in A represents the average of two independent experiments. The experiment in B was repeated three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThis study reveals that Isc1p, a phosphosphingolipase C involved in sphingolipid metabolism and ceramide generation, is required for cell cycle progression and protects cells from the genotoxic effect of MMS and HU. When cells lack the ISC1 gene, both MMS and HU lead to a G2/M block due to activation of the Swe1/Cdc28-dependent G2/M checkpoint.Mechanistically, the current investigation implicates Isc1p action upstream of Swe1/Cdc28. The results revealed that cells lacking Isc1p exhibited higher levels of phosphorylated Cdc28-Tyr-19 when compared with WT cells following treatment with HU. Cdc28 kinase is the major regulator of cell cycle progression (13Bloom J. Cross F.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 14Mendenhall M.D. Hodge A.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1191-1243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its phosphorylation on tyrosine 19 results in inhibition of its activity and consequently an inability to cross the G2/M checkpoint (22Booher R.N. Deshaies R.J. Kirschner M.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3417-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 26Lew D.J. Reed S.I. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1305-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 27Lim H.H. Goh P.Y. Surana U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6385-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This increased phosphorylation was implicated mechanistically in mediating the action of HU, as demonstrated by studies showing that expression of a mutated form of Cdc28 kinase, Y19F, which keeps the Cdc28p kinase in its active form, reversed the G2/M block in isc1Δ cells, which now behaved similar to WT in their response to HU. These results strongly suggest that Isc1p mediates its action on the G2/M block checkpoint activation through the phosphorylation of Cdc28-Tyr-19.Additional mechanistic studies implicated Swe1p, the kinase responsible for Cdc28-Tyr-19 phosphorylation in G2/M, in mediating the effects of HU on G2/M in the isc1Δ cells. Western blotting results showed that the levels of Swe1p decreased in HU-treated cells as these cells resumed cell cycle progression and negotiated the G2/M checkpoint. On the other hand, the levels of Swe1p were elevated and more persistent over time in isc1Δ cells in response to HU. Also, in α-factor synchronized cells released in nocodazole, to block them at metaphase when the levels of Swe1 are normally low, the levels of Swe1 were elevated in isc1Δ in response to HU. These results suggest failure of down-regulation of Swe1 in isc1Δ cells in response to HU.Functionally, deletion of SWE1 restored cell cycle progression and overcame the G2/M block in response to HU in isc1Δ cells. Deletion of Swe1 also overcame the sensitivity of isc1Δ cells to HU. These results define Swe1p as a major downstream mediator of the action of HU in isc1Δ cells.Taken together, these results suggest the following scenario (Fig. 6C). The recovery of yeast cells from the action of HU (and other genotoxic stresses) requires loss of Swe1p in order for these cells to negotiate the G2/M checkpoint. Indeed, a previous study has shown that HU caused the accumulation of Swe1 (28Liu H. Wang Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2746-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); however, the kinetics of that effect and the potential role of Swe1 were not investigated. The results from this study reveal that the subsequent decrease in Swe1p is essential for cells to traverse the G2/M checkpoint. From these findings, it emerges that ISC1-deleted cells fail to decrease Swe1p following HU treatment. This in turn causes increased phosphorylation of Cdc28 on Tyr-19, which leads to cell cycle block and increased sensitivity to HU. Thus, Isc1p emerges as a key regulator in the cell cycle progression such that recovery of cells from genotoxic agents requires the action of Isc1 upstream of Swe1p/Cdc28 in G2/M regulation.Isc1p is an enzyme of sphingolipid metabolism, and multiple studies have begun to implicate various sphingolipids in regulation of the cell cycle. Mammalian ceramide has been implicated in regulating both G1 and G2/M cell cycle progression. Several studies have shown that ceramide induces dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), leading to G0/G1 cell cycle arrest (29Lee J.Y. Bielawska A.E. Obeid L.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that accumulation of endogenous ceramide due to inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase results in a G2/M block. In yeast, sphingoid bases were found to be involved in heat stress-induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 (30Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8574-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Although the results from this study suggest a key and previously unidentified role for sphingolipids in regulation of cell cycle, they do not define the key lipid involved and whether it is dihydro/phyto-ceramide (product of ISC1), complex sphingolipids (substrates of the enzyme), or additional metabolites). Ongoing studies, using mutants involved in ceramide metabolism, suggest a role for ceramide itself and not other metabolites. Such studies, along wit"
https://openalex.org/W2066458885,"In this study, we have used a combination of biochemical and molecular biology techniques to demonstrate that the C-terminal tail domain of KIF4 directly interacts with P0, a major protein component of ribosomes. Besides, in dorsal root ganglion neurons, KIF4 and P0, as well as other ribosomal constituents, colocalize in clusters distributed along axons and neuritic tips. RNA interference suppression of KIF4 or expression of KIF4 variants lacking the tail domain or mutations of the ATP-binding site result in accumulation of P0 and other ribosomal proteins at the cell body and in their disappearance from axons. Our results also show one additional function for KIF4 involving an Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin-like domain in the second coiled-coiled region of KIF4. Expression of a KIF4 mutant lacking this domain abolishes the clustering of ribosomal constituents and prevents the anterograde translocation of the cell adhesion molecule L1. Taken together, the present results suggest that by binding to P0 through its tail domain and by using its motor activity, KIF4 is involved in the anterograde trafficking of ribosomal constituents to axons and that by means of its Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin-like domain interacts and transports L1."
https://openalex.org/W1979430207,"Rapsyn is a postsynaptic protein required for clustering of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at the neuromuscular junction. Here we report the mechanism for posttranslational control of rapsyn protein stability. We confirmed that C18H9.7-encoded RPY-1 is a rapsyn homolog in Caenorhabditis elegans by showing that human rapsyn rescued rpy-1 mutant phenotypes in nematodes, as determined by levamisole assays and micropost array behavioral assays. We found that RPY-1 was degraded in the absence of functional UNC-29, a non-alpha subunit of the receptor, in an allele-specific manner, but not in the absence of other receptor subunits. The cytoplasmic loop of UNC-29 was found to be critical for RPY-1 stability. Through RNA interference screening, we found that UBC-1, UBC-12, NEDD-8, and RBX-1 were required for degradation of RPY-1. We identified cullin (CUL)-3 as a component of E3 ligase and KEL-8 as the substrate adaptor of RPY-1. Mammalian rapsyn was ubiquitinated by the CUL3/KLHL8-containing E3 ligase in vitro, and the knockdown of KLHL-8, a mammalian KEL-8 homolog, inhibited rapsyn ubiquitination in vivo, implying evolutionary conservation of the rapsyn stability control machinery. kel-8 suppression and rpy-1 overexpression in C. elegans produced a phenotype similar to that of a loss-of-function mutation of rpy-1, suggesting that control of rapsyn abundance is important for proper function of the receptor. Our results suggest a link between the control of rapsyn abundance and congenital myasthenic syndromes."
https://openalex.org/W2038638360,"Pneumocystis pneumonia (PcP) is the most common opportunistic disease in immunocompromised patients. Alveolar macrophages are responsible for the clearance of Pneumocystis organisms; however, they undergo a high rate of apoptosis during PcP due to increased intracellular polyamine levels. In this study, the sources of polyamines and mechanisms of polyamine increase and polyamine-induced apoptosis were investigated. The level of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was elevated in alveolar macrophages, and the number of alveolar macrophages that took up exogenous polyamines was increased 20-fold during PcP. Monocytes, B lymphocytes, and CD8+ T lymphocytes that were recruited into the lung during PcP expressed high levels of ornithine decarboxylase, suggesting that these cells are sources of polyamines. Both protein and mRNA levels of antizyme inhibitor (AZI) were increased in alveolar macrophages during PcP. This AZI overexpression correlated with increased polyamine uptake by alveolar macrophages, because AZI expression knockdown decreased the polyamine uptake ability of these cells. AZI expression knockdown also decreased the apoptosis rate of alveolar macrophages. Pneumocystis organisms and zymosan A were found to induce AZI overexpression in alveolar macrophages, suggesting that beta-glucan, which is the major component of the Pneumocystis cell wall, induces AZI overexpression. The levels of mRNA, protein, and activity of polyamine oxidase were increased in alveolar macrophages during PcP, indicating that the H(2)O(2) generated during polyamine catabolism caused alveolar macrophages to undergo apoptosis. Taken together, results of this study indicate that Pneumocystis organisms induce AZI overexpression in alveolar macrophages, leading to increased polyamine synthesis and uptake and apoptosis rate of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2075269058,"Obesity and related metabolic disorders have become leading causes of adult morbidity and mortality. KRAP (Ki-ras-induced actin-interacting protein) is a cytoskeleton-associated protein and a ubiquitous protein among tissues, originally identified as a cancer-related molecule, however, its physiological roles remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that KRAP-deficient (KRAP−/−) mice show enhanced metabolic rate, decreased adiposity, improved glucose tolerance, hypoinsulinemia and hypoleptinemia. KRAP−/− mice are also protected against high-fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance despite of hyperphagia. Notably, glucose uptake in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) in KRAP−/− mice is enhanced in an insulin-independent manner, suggesting that BAT is involved in altered energy homeostasis in KRAP−/− mice, although UCP (Uncoupling protein) expressions are not altered. Of interest is the down-regulation of fatty acid metabolism-related molecules, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)-1, ACC-2 and fatty acid synthase in the liver of KRAP−/− mice, which could in part account for the metabolic phenotype in KRAP−/− mice. Thus, KRAP is a novel regulator in whole-body energy homeostasis and may be a therapeutic target in obesity and related diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2089961114,"Dolphins are well known for their complex social and foraging behaviours. Direct underwater observations of wild dolphin feeding behaviour however are rare. At mass spawning aggregations of giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama) in the Upper Spencer Gulf in South Australia, a wild female Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) was observed and recorded repeatedly catching, killing and preparing cuttlefish for consumption using a specific and ordered sequence of behaviours. Cuttlefish were herded to a sand substrate, pinned to the seafloor, killed by downward thrust, raised mid-water and beaten by the dolphin with its snout until the ink was released and drained. The deceased cuttlefish was then returned to the seafloor, inverted and forced along the sand substrate in order to strip the thin dorsal layer of skin off the mantle, thus releasing the buoyant calcareous cuttlebone. This stepped behavioural sequence significantly improves prey quality through 1) removal of the ink (with constituent melanin and tyrosine), and 2) the calcareous cuttlebone. Observations of foraging dolphin pods from above-water at this site (including the surfacing of intact clean cuttlebones) suggest that some or all of this prey handling sequence may be used widely by dolphins in the region. Aspects of the unique mass spawning aggregations of giant cuttlefish in this region of South Australia may have contributed to the evolution of this behaviour through both high abundances of spawning and weakened post-spawning cuttlefish in a small area (>10,000 animals on several kilometres of narrow rocky reef), as well as potential long-term and regular visitation by dolphin pods to this site."
https://openalex.org/W2135357068,"Anti-lymphocyte antibodies (Abs) that suppress T-cell chemotactic and other responses to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), but not to chemokines, were found in a lymphopenic patient with recurrent infections. Lymphocyte type 1 S1P receptor (S1P(1)) that transduces S1P chemotactic stimulation was recognized by patient Abs in Western blots of T cells, S1P(1) transfectants, and S1P(1)-hemagglutinin purified by monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin Ab absorption. The amino terminus of S1P(1), but not any extracellular loop, prevented anti-S1P(1) Ab suppression of S1P(1) signaling and T-cell chemotaxis to S1P. Human purified anti-S1P(1) Abs decreased mouse blood lymphocyte levels by a mean of 72%, suppressed mouse T-cell chemotaxis to S1P in vivo, and significantly reduced the severity of dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in mice. Human Abs to the amino terminus of S1P(1) suppress T-cell trafficking sufficiently to impair host defense and provide therapeutic immunosuppression."
https://openalex.org/W2053299074,"ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzymes are linked to changes in gene expression; however, it is not clear how the multiple remodeling enzymes found in eukaryotes differ in function and work together. In this report, we demonstrate that the ATP-dependent remodeling enzymes ACF and Mi2beta can direct consecutive, opposing chromatin-remodeling events, when recruited to chromatin by different transcription factors. In a cell-free system based on the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancer, we show that TFE3 induces a DNase I-hypersensitive site in an ATP-dependent reaction that requires ACF following transcription factor binding to chromatin. In a second step, PU.1 directs Mi2beta to erase an established DNase I-hypersensitive site, in an ATP-dependent reaction subsequent to PU.1 binding to chromatin, whereas ACF will not support erasure. Erasure occurred without displacing the transcription factor that initiated the site. Other tested enzymes were unable to erase the DNase I-hypersensitive site. Establishing and erasing the DNase I-hypersensitive site required transcriptional activation domains from TFE3 and PU.1, respectively. Together, these results provide important new mechanistic insight into the combinatorial control of chromatin structure."
