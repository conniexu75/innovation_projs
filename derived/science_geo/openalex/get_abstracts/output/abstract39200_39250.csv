https://openalex.org/W1749647045,"Murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes proliferate normally in medium containing fetal calf serum depleted of insulin, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). However, the cells do not differentiate into adipocytes in the presence of the hormone-depleted serum. Supplementation of the growth medium with 10-20 nM IGF-I or 2 microM insulin restores the ability of 3T3-L1 cells to develop into adipocytes. The cells acquire an adipocyte morphology, accumulate triglycerides, and express a 450-fold increase in the activity of the lipogenic enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The increase in glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity is paralleled by the accumulation of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA and mRNA for the myelin P2-like protein aP2, another marker for fat cell development. IGF-I or insulin-stimulated adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells is not dependent on growth hormone. Occupancy of preadipocyte IGF-I receptors by IGF-I (or insulin) is implicated as a central step in the differentiation process. The IGF-I receptor binds insulin with a 70-fold lower affinity than IGF-I, and 30-70-fold higher levels of insulin are required to duplicate the effects of an optimal amount of IGF-I. The effects of 10-20 nM IGF-I are likely to be mediated by high affinity (KD = 5 nM) IGF-I receptors that are expressed at a density of 13,000 sites/preadipocyte. In undifferentiated cells the IGF-I receptor concentration is twice that of the insulin receptor. After adipocyte differentiation is triggered, the number and affinity of IGF-I receptors remain constant while insulin receptor number increases approximately 25-fold as developing adipocytes become responsive to insulin at the level of metabolic regulation. Thus, preadipocytes have the potential for a maximal response to IGF-I, whereas the accumulation of more than 95% of adipocyte insulin receptors and the appearance of responsiveness to insulin are consequences of differentiation. IGF-I or insulin is essential for the induction of a variety of abundant and nonabundant mRNAs characteristic of 3T3-L1 adipocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2067310224,"Transport of nuclear-encoded precursor proteins into mitochondria includes proteolytic cleavage of amino-terminal targeting sequences in the mitochondrial matrix. We have isolated the processing activity from Neurospora crassa. The final preparation (enriched ca. 10,000-fold over cell extracts) consists of two proteins, the matrix processing peptidase (MPP, 57 kd) and a processing enhancing protein (PEP, 52 kd). The two components were isolated as monomers. PEP is about 15-fold more abundant in mitochondria than MPP. It is partly associated with the inner membrane, while MPP is soluble in the matrix. MPP alone has a low processing activity whereas PEP alone has no apparent activity. Upon recombining both, full processing activity is restored. Our data indicate that MPP contains the catalytic site and that PEP has an enhancing function. The mitochondrial processing enzyme appears to represent a new type of ""signal peptidase,"" different from the bacterial leader peptidase and the signal peptidase of the endoplasmic reticulum."

https://openalex.org/W2089037219,"Spontaneous diabetes mellitus was blocked in nonobese diabetic mice by treatment with a monoclonal antibody against the L3T4 determinant present on the surface of T-helper lymphocytes. Sustained treatment with the monoclonal antibody led to cessation of the lymphocytic infiltration associated with the destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells. Moreover, the mice remained normoglycemic after the antibody therapy was stopped. These studies indicate that immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies to the lymphocyte subset may not only halt the progression of diabetes, but may lead to long-term reversal of the disease after therapy has ended."
https://openalex.org/W1592556850,"Abstract Neuromodulin (formerly designated P-57) is an abundant, neural specific, calmodulin-binding protein which exhibits higher affinity for calmodulin in the absence of free Ca2+ than in the presence of free Ca2+. In this study a series of proteolytic fragments of neuromodulin were systematically screened for calmodulin-Sepharose binding activity. A 9-amino acid fragment, designated M1-C1 and having the sequence RGHITRKKL, was identified as the putative CaM-binding domain of neuromodulin. Two heptadecapeptides, designated FP57-Phe and FP57-Trp, were synthesized, each containing the M1-C1 sequence and the four flanking amino acids from each site. The FP57-Trp peptide contained a tryptophan residue in place of the native phenylalanine. Anti-FP57-Phe antibody binding to neuromodulin was inhibited by preincubation of antibodies with excess FP57-Phe. 125I-CaM gel overlay of neuromodulin was inhibited by anti-FP57-Phe antibodies. Addition of CaM to FP57-Trp increased peptide tryptophanyl fluorescence. In the presence of Ca2+, the stoichiometry of the FP57-Trp.CaM complex was 1:1, FP57-Trp binding to CaM was competitive with neuromodulin. The Ca2+-independent dissociation constant of the FP57-Phe.CaM complex was 0.41 microM. The Ca2+-dependent affinity of the complex could not be measured directly but appeared to be significantly greater than the Ca2+-independent affinity."

https://openalex.org/W2061049700,"Masking of host cell receptors following retroviral infection is the basis for the phenomenon of virus interference. Amphotropic retrovirus vectors were used to express the HIV envelope glycoprotein in a human CD4+ cell line. Envelope expression is accompanied by a reduction in the level of surface CD4 receptor molecules and correlates with the presence of intracellular envelope-CD4 receptor complexes. Cells expressing the HIV envelope acquire a cytolysis-resistant phenotype such that infection with HIV leads to a non-cytopathic persistent virus infection. Furthermore, phorbol ester-mediated stimulation of viral replication in persistently infected cells results in renewed cytolytic effects which, due to the absence of CD4 in the cell population, are absolutely independent of syncytium formation. This study elucidates the mechanism by which viral persistence is initiated and maintained in the course of AIDS."

https://openalex.org/W1521699044,"Previous findings have shown that thyroid hormone markedly increases the speed of diastolic relaxation in the heart. This thyroid hormone-dependent change is also accompanied by an increased Ca2+ pumping ability in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In an effort to determine the underlying cause of improved Ca2+ transport, mRNA levels of the slow Ca2+-ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum were quantified on Northern blots. In hypothyroid rat hearts, the steady state level of Ca2+-ATPase mRNA was only 36% of control levels, whereas hyperthyroid rat heart mRNA levels were 136% of control. Ca2+-ATPase mRNA responded rapidly to T3, as the mRNA level was significantly increased by 2 h and normalized by 5 h after T3 injection into hypothyroid rats. The well established effect of thyroid hormone on improved myocardial contractility and increased speed of diastolic relaxation may in part relate to specific alterations in the level of the mRNA coding for Ca2+-ATPase, resulting in increased pump units."
https://openalex.org/W2102154746,"The factor(s) responsible for the adenovirus E1A-stimulated transcription of RNA polymerase III genes was localized previously in a chromatographic fraction containing transcription factor IIIC (TFIIIC). In further studies, two distinct forms of TFIIIC, which were chromatographically separable, generated VA geneprotein complexes that were distinguished by gel shift assays. The form of TFIIIC that generated the more slowly migrating promoter complex had greater transcriptional activity in vitro, associated more rapidly with the promoter, and formed a more salt-resistant complex. Greater amounts of this more active form of TFIIIC resulted from either E1A expression during infection or growth of the cells in a higher concentration of serum, whereas template commitment assays indicated that overall TFIIIC concentrations remained unchanged during viral infection. The in vitro interconversion of the two forms of TFIIIC by phosphatase treatment suggests that transcriptional activation of RNA polymerase III genes can be mediated by phosphorylation of TFIIIC."
https://openalex.org/W1541823741,"After removal of very late antigen (VLA) 2 material from a radiolabeled detergent lysate of platelets, another VLA heterodimer was precipitated using antibody to the common VLA beta subunit. This structure was identified as VLA-5 because it contained VLA beta plus an alpha subunit that was (i) recognized by anti-alpha 5 antibodies and (ii) cleaved by V8 protease to yield a characteristic alpha 5-like pattern of peptide fragments. Besides VLA-2 and VLA-5, a third heterodimer, here named VLA-6, was also present on platelets. VLA-6 (an alpha 6 beta complex) was defined using the monoclonal antibody GoH3 (Sonnenberg, A., Janssen, H., Hogervorst, F., Calafat, J., and Hilgers, J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10376-10383). Although it resembled VLA-5 in size, VLA-6 was different from VLA-5 because (i) removal of the alpha 5 subunit did not remove alpha 6, (ii) removal of alpha 6 by the GoH3 antibody did not remove alpha 5, (iii) the alpha 5 and alpha 6 subunits had very distinct one-dimensional V8 peptide maps, and (iv) the alpha 6 and alpha 5 subunits had distinct migration patterns on two-dimensional O'Farrell gels. The beta subunit of VLA-6 was identified as the common VLA beta subunit because (i) it was recognized by anti-VLA beta antibody and (ii) it yielded a V8 protease cleavage map characteristic of beta. VLA-6 was not readily seen in anti-VLA beta immunoprecipitations, apparently because the alpha 6 subunit is only loosely or partially associated with the VLA beta subunit. Because VLA-5 and VLA-6 both closely resemble the previously defined Ic-IIa platelet protein complex, it is likely that there is more than one platelet Ic protein complexed with IIa."
https://openalex.org/W1606221581,"Cloning and sequencing of the human type II insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor cDNA revealed an 80% deduced amino acid sequence homology with the bovine cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) receptor, suggesting identity of the two receptors (Morgan, D. O., Edman, J. C., Standring, D. N., Fried, V. A., Smith, M. C., Roth, R. A., and Rutter, W. J. (1987) Nature 329, 301-307). We have performed biochemical experiments that support this proposal. Rat liver type II IGF receptor, purified by the conventional method of IGF-II affinity chromatography, bound quantitatively to a beta-galactosidase affinity column and was eluted with Man-6-P. Bovine liver Man-6-P receptor, prepared by the conventional method of affinity chromatography on phosphomannan-Sepharose, bound IGF-II with high affinity (Kd = 1 nM). Affinity cross-linking of 125I-IGF-II to the Man-6-P receptor and analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis showed that beta-galactosidase, but not Man-6-P, inhibited the formation of the 250-kDa 125I-IGF-II-receptor complex. The inhibition by beta-galactosidase was prevented by coincubation with Man-6-P. 125I-IGF-II did not bind to the 46-kDa cation-dependent Man-6-P receptor. For immunologic studies we purified type II IGF receptors and Man-6-P receptors in parallel from rat placental membranes using either IGF-II- or beta-galactosidase affinity chromatography. A panel of five antisera that previously had been raised against either type II IGF receptor or Man-6-P receptor behaved identically toward type II IGF receptor versus Man-6-P receptor in ligand blocking and immunoprecipitation assays. Our data support the conclusion that the type II IGF receptor and the cation-independent Man-6-P receptor are the same protein and that the IGF-II and Man-6-P-binding sites are distinct."
https://openalex.org/W1603134043,"In addition to protease La (the lon gene product), Escherichia coli contains another ATP-dependent protease, Ti. This enzyme (approximately 340 kDa) is composed of two components, both of which are required for proteolysis. Both have been purified to homogeneity by conventional procedures using [3H]casein as the substrate. The ATP-stabilized component, A, has a subunit molecular weight of 80,000 upon gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, but it behaves as a dimer (140 kDa) upon gel filtration. Component P, which is relatively heat stable, is inactivated by diisopropyl fluorophosphate and can be labeled with [3H] diisopropyl fluorophosphate. It has a subunit size of 23 kDa, but the isolated component behaves as a complex (260 kDa) of 10-12 subunits. The isoelectric point of component A is 7.0 and that of P is 8.2, and their amino acid compositions differ considerably. The purified enzyme has an ATPase activity that is stimulated 2-4-fold by casein and other protein substrates but not by nonhydrolyzed proteins. Component A also shows ATPase activity which can be stimulated by casein. Addition of component P (which lacks ATPase activity) inhibits basal ATP hydrolysis by A and makes this ATPase more responsive to casein. Although component P contains the serine active site for proteolysis, it shows no proteolytic activity in the absence of component A, Mg2+, and ATP or dATP. Other nucleoside triphosphates are not hydrolyzed and do not support proteolysis. Protease Ti has a Km for ATP of 210 microM for hydrolysis of both casein and ATP. Casein increases the Vmax for ATP without affecting the Km. A Mg2+ concentration of 5 mM is necessary for half-maximal rates of ATP and casein hydrolysis. Ca2+ and Mn2+ partially support these activities. Thus, protease Ti shares many unusual properties with protease La (e.g. coupled ATP and protein hydrolysis and protein-activated ATPase), but these functions in protease Ti are associated with distinct subunits that modify each other's activities."

https://openalex.org/W1527048315,"This study demonstrates internalization of interleukin-1 (IL-1) via its cell surface receptor on human diploid fibroblasts and shows intracellular localization of IL-1 beta. Binding experiments at 8 degrees C using confluent fibroblast monolayers revealed 5,000-15,000 IL-1 receptors/cell that bound both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. Incubation of monolayers with 125I-IL-1 beta (10(-9) M) at 8 degrees C and then at 37 degrees C for various times up to 8 h revealed a t1/2 for internalization of receptor-bound IL-1 beta of about 1.5 h. In addition, it was shown that IL-1 beta internalized via receptors was undegraded and retained binding activity. Electron microscopic autoradiography of monolayers incubated with 125I-IL-1 beta, as above, showed a progressive increase in the ratio of cytoplasmic to cell surface-associated grains. Grains at the cell surface were primarily localized at cell processes or attachment sites, frequently close to intra- and extracellular filamentous material. During incubation at 37 degrees C, most grains were free in the cytoplasm, with few present in lysosomes or vesicles. After 1 h, approximately 15% of the grains were over nuclei. Control cultures incubated at 37 degrees C with 125I-IL-1 beta and 100-fold excess unlabeled IL-1 beta showed increased uptake of label into lysosomes and little into nuclei. This study shows that IL-1 receptors are primarily located at fibroblast processes and that receptor-mediated internalization of the ligand is slow. Nuclear localization apparently requires IL-1 receptor-specific internalization of IL-1 beta, suggesting a possible role for this process in eliciting the IL-1 signal."

https://openalex.org/W1596561444,"Smooth muscle myosin can be phosphorylated by myosin light chain kinase at the serine 19 and threonine 18 residues of the two 20,000-dalton light chains (Ikebe, M., Hartshorne, D. J., and Elizinga, M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 36-39). These studies with myosin and heavy meromyosin (HMM) compare the effects induced by phosphorylation of serine 19 (M2P and HMM2P) and serine 19 plus threonine 18 (M4P and HMM4P). Formation of M4P altered the KCl dependence of viscosity and Mg2+-ATPase and higher values were maintained at lower ionic strengths, compared to M2P or dephosphorylated myosin (Mo). This is consistent with the stabilization of the 6 S conformation. The tendency for aggregation, as judged by light scattering, followed the sequence M4P greater than M2P greater than Mo. Filaments formed with M4P were more resistant to dissociation by ATP compared to filaments of M2P. Phosphorylation of HMM2P doubled Vmax of actin-activated ATPase with little effect on the apparent affinity for actin. The Mg2+-ATPase of HMM4P exhibited a higher activity at low ionic strength compared to HMM2P and HMMo. Hydrodynamic differences were detected at low ionic strength in the presence of ATP by sedimentation velocity measurements with HMM4P, HMM2P, and HMMo. Proteolysis by papain indicated an increased susceptibility of the head-neck junction of HMM4P compared to HMM2P. These data suggest that the phosphorylation of threonine 18 in addition to serine 19 change the conformation of myosin and HMM and this is associated with altered biological properties."
https://openalex.org/W142220879,"UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:alpha-3-D-mannoside beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I catalyzes an essential first step in the conversion of high mannose to hybrid and complex N-glycans (Schachter, H. (1986) Biochem. Cell Biol. 64, 163-181; Oppenheimer, C.L., and Hill, R.L. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 799-804), i.e. the addition of GlcNAc to (Man alpha 1-6(Man alpha 1-3)Man alpha 1-6)(Man alpha 1-3)Man beta 1-4GlcNAc-OR to form (Man alpha 1-6(Man alpha 1-3)Man alpha 1-6)(GlcNAc beta 1-2Man alpha 1- 3)Man beta 1-4GlcNAc-OR. The enzyme has been purified from Triton X-100 extracts of rabbit liver by chromatography on CM-Sephadex, Affi-Gel blue, UDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose, and a novel adsorbent in which UDP-GlcNAc is linked to thiopropyl-Sepharose at the 5-position of uracil. The enzyme exists in crude liver extracts in two molecular weight forms separable on Sephadex G-200. The low molecular weight form was purified 64,000-fold with a specific activity of 19.8 mumol/min/mg. The pure enzyme was free of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II-V activities. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a single major band of Mr 45,000 and two minor bands of Mr 54,000 and 50,000. All three bands showed retarded elution from an affinity column in which the acceptor substrate for the transferase was covalently linked to Sepharose. Kinetic analysis indicated a largely ordered sequential mechanism with UDP-GlcNAc binding to the enzyme first and UDP leaving last. Studies with synthetic analogues of the substrate Man alpha 1-6(Man alpha 1-3)Man beta 1-4GlcNAc showed that an unsubstituted equatorial hydroxyl on carbon 4 of the beta-linked Man residue was essential for enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1966414797,"Mammalian spliceosomes were purified in preparative amounts by gel filtration chromatography and shown to be functional by in vitro complementation experiments. The column fractions containing spliceosomes are enriched in the snRNAs U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 and a subset of proteins present in the nuclear extract. Splicing intermediates, the entire set of snRNAs, and the enriched proteins can be immuno-precipitated with three different monoclonal antibodies that recognize snRNP determinants. At least one U1 snRNP is present in each spliceosome since the particles are quantitatively immunoprecipitated by an anti-U1 snRNP monoclonal antibody. Examination of the spliceosome fractions by EM revealed a relatively homogeneous population of 4060 mm particles with a striking morphology. Evidence that these particles are spliceosomes is their sensitivity to micrococcal nuclease, their ATP-dependent assembly, and their immunoprecipitation with a trimethyl cap monoclonal antibody. In addition, pre-mRNA was visualized in the particles by EM."
https://openalex.org/W1616231937,"Endonexin II is a member of the family of Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding proteins known as annexins. We cloned human endonexin II cDNA and expressed it in Escherichia coli. The apparent size and Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding properties of purified recombinant endonexin II were indistinguishable from those of the placental protein. A single mRNA of approximately 1.6 kilobase pairs was found to be expressed in human cell lines and placenta and was in close agreement with the length of the cDNA clone (1.59 kilobase pairs). The cDNA predicted a 320-amino acid protein with a sequence that was in agreement with the previously determined partial amino acid sequence of endonexin II isolated from placenta. Endonexin II contained 58, 46, and 43% sequence identity to protein II, calpactin I (p36, protein I), and lipocortin I (p35), respectively. The partial sequence of bovine endonexin I was aligned with the sequence of endonexin II to give 63% sequence identity. Like these other proteins, endonexin II had a 4-fold internal repeat of approximately 70 residues preceded by an amino-terminal domain lacking similarity to the repeated region. It also had significant sequence identity with 67-kDa calelectrin (p68), a protein with an 8-fold internal repeat. Comparing the amino-terminal domains of these four proteins of known sequence revealed that, in general, only endonexin II and protein II had significant sequence identity (29%). Endonexin II was not phosphorylated by Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme (protein kinase C) even though it contained a threonine at a position analogous to the protein kinase C phosphorylation sites of lipocortin I, calpactin I, and protein II."
https://openalex.org/W1568181210,"Cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells superfused with [14C]arachidonic acid synthesized the antiplatelet substance prostacyclin as the major cyclooxygenase product. Prostacyclin synthesis was inactivated by aspirin, which irreversibly acetylates cyclooxygenase. Aspirin-treated cells recovered within 2 h by a process that was blocked by cycloheximide but not by actinomycin D, and that required a serum component identified as epidermal growth factor (EGF). EGF-induced recovery of cyclooxygenase was greatly potentiated by type beta transforming growth factor (TGF-beta). Incubation with EGF and TGF-beta in the 0.1-1.0 nanomolar range stimulated cyclooxygenase recovery up to 20-fold without increasing [35S]methionine incorporation into other cell proteins. Induction of cyclooxygenase by EGF and TGF-beta also was prevented by cycloheximide but not by actinomycin D. EGF-dependent recovery was blocked by preincubation with dexamethasone (2 microM), an effect that was duplicated by pure lipocortin (2-4 micrograms/ml). Incubation of membrane preparations from these cells with EGF selectively activated phosphorylation of a 35-kDa cellular protein that comigrated with lipocortin. The results suggest that cyclooxygenase recovery in aspirin-inactivated vascular smooth muscle cells is mediated by an EGF-dependent translational control that is inhibited by corticosteroids. The findings also provide a new mechanism whereby corticosteroids suppress inflammatory prostaglandins."
https://openalex.org/W1970542209,"We have shown previously that a synthetic peptide of 49 amino acids, encoding mainly adenovirus E1A protein domain 3 (PD3), functions as an autonomous transcriptional activator. Here we provide two lines of evidence showing that E1A transactivation does not require the induction of cellular protein synthesis. First, PD3 rapidly transactivates E1A-inducible early viral genes in the presence of inhibitors of protein synthesis, as demonstrated by microinjectionin situ hybridization experiments. Second, PD3 greatly stimulates transcription of E1A-inducible genes in vitro. Mutant PD3 peptides with single amino acid substitutions in conserved cysteine residues are defective in transactivation both in vivo and in vitro. Our findings provide compelling evidence that protein synthesis is not required for E1A transactivation, and support a model in which E1A modifies the activity of a preexisting cellular protein(s) involved in the regulation of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1586123980,"The cell surface of Aeromonas salmonicida is covered by a regular surface array composed of a single species of protein, the A-protein (Phipps, B. M., Trust, T. J., Ishiguro, E. E., and Kay, W. W. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 2934-2939). The array, known as the A-layer, is the key virulence factor for this organism. Cells containing the A-layer specifically bound rabbit IgG and human IgM with high affinity (KD = 1.0 X 10(-6) M and 3.3 X 10(-6) M, respectively), but neither isogenic A-protein-deficient strains nor an Aeromonas hydrophila strain also possessing a regular surface array had binding activity. Selective removal of A-protein at pH 2.2 inactivated IgG binding. Structurally intact IgG was requisite for binding since both Fab and Fc fragments were inactive. Aeromonas A-protein did not share the same IgG binding sites as Staphylococcus aureus protein A. Purified A-protein bound IgG only weakly, but reassembled A-layer regained binding activity. Protein modification and perturbation of the A-layer indicated that no single amino acid residue was critical for binding, and that the binding site consisted of a native arrangement of at least four A-protein monomers in the layer."
https://openalex.org/W1557963198,"The T cell antigen receptor (TCR) consists of a disulfide-linked TCR-alpha/beta heterodimer that is both structurally and functionally associated with a set of four non-covalently linked membrane proteins termed CD3-gamma, -delta, -epsilon, and -zeta. An additional protein described recently, CD3-omega, has been suggested to play a role in assembly of the CD3 complex on the basis of its transient association with the CD3 proteins early during biosynthesis. Association of all the proteins seems to be a prerequisite for intracellular transport, since mutants lacking either the TCR-alpha or -beta protein do not express the CD3 complex on the cell surface. CD3-cDNAs were transfected into COS cells in order to study the protein-protein interactions ruling the assembly of the CD3 macromolecular structure. CD3-delta-epsilon, CD3-gamma-epsilon, and CD3-gamma-delta-epsilon intermediates could be detected. These data indicated that a CD3 core structure could be formed in the absence of the other members of the complex (CD3-zeta, -omega, TCR-alpha, and -beta). Both the individual CD3 chains and the assembled CD3.gamma.delta.epsilon complexes could not be detected on the cellular surface but in an intracellular compartment, probably the endoplasmic reticulum or the cis Golgi. The transfection experiments allowed us to identify the 25-kDa member of the murine CD3 complex as CD3-epsilon m. Furthermore, a 23-kDa glycoprotein seen upon metabolic labeling of human T cells was shown to be an immature form of the CD3-gamma h protein."
https://openalex.org/W1636197238,"A strand exchange reaction between a single-stranded DNA circle and a homologous linear double-stranded DNA molecule is catalyzed by a mixture of two T4 bacteriophage proteins, the uvsX protein (a DNA-dependent ATPase that resembles the recA protein) and the gene 32 protein (a helix-destabilizing protein). The products are different from those formed in the corresponding recA protein-catalyzed reaction; rather than producing a linear single strand plus a nicked circular double-stranded (form II) DNA molecule as the final products, interlinked DNA networks are rapidly generated. Electron microscopy reveals that these networks form from multiple pairing reactions that involve the recombination intermediates. Since the uvsX protein is present in substoichiometric quantities, it presumably recycles to catalyze these successive pairing events. Recycling of the uvsX protein has been more directly examined in an assay that monitors the rate of uvsX protein-catalyzed branch migration. The branch migration reaction is rapidly inhibited by dilution of the uvsX protein or by the addition of a heterologous competitor DNA, showing that the uvsX protein-DNA filaments that catalyze strand exchange are dynamic structures. The evidence suggests that individual uvsX protein monomers are continuously entering and leaving the cooperatively formed filament in a cycle that is strongly affected by their ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1492419563,"We have previously described a hybrid protein, GHHA, that contains a fragment of the influenza hemagglutinin joined to the C terminus of a nearly complete rat growth hormone (Rizzolo, L.J., Finidori, J., Gonzalez, A., Arpin, M., Ivanov, I.E., Adesnik, M., and Sabatini, D.D. (1985) J. Cell Biol. 101, 1351-1362). GHHA was transported from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to a smooth cisterna, continuous with the rough ER, but proximal to the Golgi apparatus. We have now labeled GHHA with [3H]palmitate, demonstrating that fatty acylation can occur in the ER. As expected for a thioester linkage, the label was released from GHHA by hydroxylamine and identified as palmitic acid by thin-layer chromatography. In a second study, we analyzed the structure of the N-linked carbohydrate chain of GHHA. The N-linked oligosaccharides, all high-mannose type, were released by endoglycosidase H and size-fractionated by high pressure liquid chromatography. The predominant structures were Glc1Man8GlcNAc and Man8GlcNAc, indicating that only 2 or 3 glucose and 1 mannose residues were removed from the original Glc3Man9GlcNAc2. Determination of the structure by acetolysis fragmentation indicated that a single Man8GlcNAc isomer was formed by a deoxymannojirimycin-sensitive alpha-mannosidase. This contrasts with a previously characterized ER alpha-mannosidase (Bischoff, J., Liscum, L., and Kornfeld, R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 4766-4774) that generates the same isomer, but is deoxymannojirimycin-resistant. These data suggest the possibility that different enzymes are partitioned within the ER."
https://openalex.org/W1550519216,"We have previously demonstrated that plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) is associated with the extracellular matrix of cultured bovine smooth muscle cells (Knudsen, B.S., Harpel, P.C., Nachman, R.L. (1987) J. Clin. Invest. 80, 1082-1089). In this report we describe the physiologic role of PAI-1 during the interaction of the tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) secreting Bowes human melanoma cell line with endothelial extracellular matrices. In addition we have characterized the t-PA.PAI complexes formed during this interaction in the presence and absence of plasminogen. In the absence of plasminogen, a 104-kDa complex between Bowes t-PA and PAI-1 appears in the supernatant. In the presence of plasminogen, PAI initially prevents plasmin formation on the matrix and protects the matrix from degradation by plasmin. The 104-kDa t-PA.PAI complex is degraded into a 68 and a 47-kDa complex by small amounts of plasmin generated from secreted Bowes t-PA and plasminogen. Analysis of these complexes revealed that t-PA is rapidly cleaved by plasmin within the complex whereas complexed PAI-1 is not further degraded.

A transcriptional fusion between the ninaE promoter and the structural gene for a minor opsin (Rh2) that is not normally expressed in the R1–R6 photoreceptor cells was used to demonstrate that Rh2 rhodopsin can photoactivate the R1–R6 transduction cascade, but with different spectral sensitivity. In addition, we show that two mutants that specifically affect the R1–R6 cells, ninaA and rdgB, do not directly affect expression of the ninaE gene."
https://openalex.org/W1503925633,"Abstract 5'-Flanking sequences from the human atrial natriuretic factor (hANF) gene were subcloned into a reporter plasmid (pSVOCAT) and transfected into primary cultures of neonatal rat atrial cardiocytes. Hybrid hANFCAT genes containing either 2500 or 409 base pairs of 5'-flanking sequence DNA were expressed at similar levels. When sequences between -409 and -332 were deleted, reporter gene (CAT) activity decreased significantly. Expression of the hANFCAT constructs was specific for atrial cells, as no expression was detected in primary cultures of ventricular cardiocytes or nonmyocardial cells derived from the neonatal hearts. Correct transcription start sites for the transfected hANF genes were confirmed by S1 nuclease mapping and RNase protection analysis. A gel shift assay was used to identify a specific cardiac nuclear protein which bound to the 5'-flanking sequence of the hANF gene. A 192-base pair PvuII fragment (-400 to -208) associated with a protein in these extracts in a tissue- and sequence-specific fashion. These findings indicate that the DNA sequence between -409 and -332 in the hANF gene harbors a tissue-specific element whose activity may involve association with a cardiac-specific nuclear protein."
https://openalex.org/W1513376682,"Primary cultures of neonatal rat atrial myocytes were maintained in two different serum-free media for up to 25 days. Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography coupled with atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)-specific radioimmunoassay demonstrated that the cultures maintained in our previously described serum-free medium (Glembotski, C.C., and Gibson, T. R. (1985) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 132, 1008-1017) secreted primarily ANF-(1-126)-like material, whereas those cultures maintained in a different formulation of medium secreted mostly ANF-(99-126)-like material. Cultures that secreted ANF(99-126)-like material were biosynthetically labeled with [35S]cysteine followed by immunoprecipitation of secreted ANF and analysis by reversed-phase, size exclusion, and ion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography. The labeled ANF-(99-126)-like peptide was shown to be chromatographically indistinguishable from other synthetic peptides related to ANF-(99-126). Labeled ANF purified from extracts of the cultured cells was chromatographically indistinguishable from authentic ANF-(1-126), and could be cleaved specifically by thrombin into labeled ANF-(99-126)-like material. These results indicate that primary atrial myocytes maintained under certain serum-free conditions are capable of secreting ANF-related material that is chromatographically indistinguishable from ANF-(99-126), the known circulating form of the hormone. Additional preliminary studies suggest that the presence of glucocorticoids in the culture medium may confer ANF processing ability on cultured myocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1544878860,"At least three enzymes have been identified in atrial tissue homogenates that are capable of processing pro-atrial natriuretic factor to active atrial peptides. The atrial peptides possess potent natriuretic, diuretic, vasorelaxant, and hemodynamic properties, and their existence has implicated the mammalian heart as an endocrine organ. We have purified and characterized a serine proteinase (Mr approximately equal to 70,000) associated with atrial granules that preferentially hydrolyzes the Arg-Ser bond in the synthetic substrates Gly-Pro-Arg-Ser-Leu-Arg, benzoyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-Ser-Leu-Arg, and benzoyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-Ser-Leu-Arg-Arg-2-naphthylamide, the Arg-2-naphthylamide bond in the substrate benzoyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-2-naphthylamide, and the Arg-Ser bond in a 31-residue substrate (Gly96-Tyr126 peptide) corresponding to residues Arg98-Ser99 in pro-atrial natriuretic factor. The Gly96-Tyr126 peptide contains the putative processing site in pro-atrial natriuretic factor and the sequence for the bioactive peptides. Our results indicate that the minimum processing site sequence is -Gly-Pro-Arg-Ser-Leu-Arg-Arg- and that the Ser99-Tyr126 natriuretic peptide is the predominant hydrolytic product. After prolonged incubation or at high enzyme concentrations, the Ser103-Tyr126 natriuretic peptide may also be formed. The Ser103-Arg125 natriuretic peptide was only a very minor product. The doublet of basic amino acids is not the primary processing site in pro-atrial natriuretic factor, but their presence may influence cleavage at the single Arg residue upstream. Our findings are consistent with the idea that the pro-protein and the processing enzymes are packaged into the secretory granule and in response to the proper stimulus, the pro-protein is processed to the active peptides, probably during the process of secretion. The processing pathway of pro-atrial natriuretic factor is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1539353015,"The recA1 mutation is a single point mutation that replaces glycine 160 of the recA polypeptide with an aspartic acid residue. The mutant recA1 protein has a greatly reduced single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity at pH 7.5 compared to the wild-type protein. Interestingly, the recA1 protein does exhibit a vigorous ATPase activity at pH 6.2. To explore the molecular basis of this pH effect, we used site-directed mutagenesis to replace aspartic acid 160 of the recA1 polypeptide with an isosteric, but nonionizing, asparagine residue. The new [Asn160]recA protein catalyzes ATP hydrolysis at pH 7.5 with the same turnover number as the wild-type protein. This result suggests that the activation of the recA1 protein ATPase activity that occurs at pH 6.2 may be due, in part, to neutralization of the negatively charged aspartic acid 160 side chain. Although it is an active single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase, the [Asn160]recA protein is unable to complement a recA deletion in vivo and is unable to carry out the three-strand exchange reaction in vitro. Further examination of ATP hydrolysis (under strand exchange conditions) revealed that the ATPase activity of the [Asn160]recA protein is strongly suppressed in the presence of Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein (a component of the strand exchange assay), whereas the ATPase activity of the wild-type recA protein is stimulated by the E. coli protein. To account for these results, we speculate that ATP may induce specific conformational changes in the wild-type recA protein that are essential to the DNA pairing process and that these conformational changes may not occur with the [Asn160]recA protein."
https://openalex.org/W1587422543,"A seryl protease which catalyzes conversion of proatrial natriuretic factor (ANF) to the active circulating form, ANF(99-126), was purified from a particulate fraction of bovine atria. The enzyme was solubilized with 1.6 M KCl. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was 580 kDa on gel filtration, whereas by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis a cluster of six bands with molecular masses around 30 kDa was observed. The purified enzyme produced ANF(99-126) from partially purified bovine pro-ANF by the selective cleavage of the arginyl peptide bond in the -Pro97-Arg98-Ser99-sequence in pro-ANF. The enzyme was localized mainly in the microsomal fraction rather than the granule fraction. It is likely that the enzyme selectively cleaves the Arg98-Ser99 peptide bond in pro-ANF during the process of secretion."

These proteins, which play roles in both transcriptional control and oncogenic transformation, have identical sequences except for the presence in 289R of 46 additional internal amino acids. Phosphorylation was detected exclusively at serine residues. E1A proteins purified from [35S]methionine- or [32P]orthophosphate-labeled Ad5-infected cells were digested with trypsin, and two phosphopeptides were isolated by reverse-phase chromatography and subjected to automated Edman degradation. The major species was shown to contain a single phosphorylation site at Ser-219. The second phosphopeptide was shown to contain at least one phosphorylation site at Ser-231. A third phosphorylated tryptic peptide could not be eluted from the column but was isolated using an E1A-specific rat monoclonal antibody. Following subcleavage by Staphylococcus aureus V-8 protease, this peptide was shown to contain at least one phosphorylation site at Ser-89. The present data indicate that both the 289R and 243R E1A proteins are phosphorylated at the same sites, at least one in the amino terminal half of the molecule, and at least two toward the carboxyl terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1504805812,"The maturation and packaging of bacteriophage lambda DNA are catalyzed by the phage terminase enzyme. Terminase is composed of two protein subunits, gpNu1 and gpA. The holoenzyme is multifunctional in vitro; it binds to and cleaves lambda DNA at the cos site (where cos represents cohesive-end site), packages DNA into lambda proheads, and is also a DNA-dependent ATPase. The genes of the two subunits have been cloned separately into powerful expression vectors which allow for very high levels of protein overproduction. The gpNu1 protein has been purified to homogeneity and has a monomeric molecular weight of 21,200, in close agreement with the Mr of 20,444 expected from its amino acid sequence. Both gel filtration and sedimentation velocity centrifugation indicate that the native gpNu1 protein exists as a Mr greater than 500,000 aggregate. The sequence of the first 20 amino acids and the overall composition both match those predicted by the nucleotide sequence of the Nu1 gene. Purified gpNu1 is able to complement gpA-containing extracts in both lambda DNA packaging and cos cleavage assays. The Nu1 gene amino acid sequence predicts DNA binding by the protein, and gpNu1 does show specific binding to lambda DNA by filter binding assays. Also, as predicted from its sequence, gpNu1 exhibits ATPase activity; but in contrast to the holoenzyme, this activity is DNA-independent."
https://openalex.org/W1489320418,"Phosphorylation of the 20-kDa light chain regulates adult smooth muscle myosin; phosphorylation by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzyme myosin light chain kinase stimulates the actomyosin ATPase activity of adult smooth muscle myosin; the simultaneous phosphorylation of a separate site on the 20-kDa light chain by the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme protein kinase C attenuates the myosin light chain kinase-induced increase in the actomyosin ATPase activity of adult myosin. Fetal smooth muscle myosin, purified from 12-day-old fertilized chicken eggs, is structurally different from adult smooth muscle myosin. Nevertheless, phosphorylation of a single site on the 20-kDa light chain of fetal myosin by myosin light chain kinase results in stimulation of the actomyosin ATPase activity of this myosin. Protein kinase C, in contrast, phosphorylates three sites on the fetal myosin 20-kDa light chain including a serine or threonine residue on the same peptide phosphorylated by myosin light chain kinase. Interestingly, phosphorylation by protein kinase C stimulates the actomyosin ATPase activity of fetal myosin. Moreover, unlike adult myosin, there is no attenuation of the actomyosin ATPase activity when fetal myosin is simultaneously phosphorylated by myosin light chain kinase and protein kinase C. These data demonstrate, for the first time, the in vitro activation of a smooth muscle myosin by another enzyme besides myosin light chain kinase and raise the possibility of alternate pathways for regulating smooth muscle myosin in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1560497510,"Neurospora crassa mycelia, when starved for polyamines, have 50-70-fold more ornithine decarboxylase activity and enzyme protein than unstarved mycelia. Using isotopic labeling and immunoprecipitation, we determined the half-life and the synthetic rate of the enzyme in mycelia differing in the rates of synthesis of putrescine, the product of ornithine decarboxylase, and spermidine, the main end-product of the polyamine pathway. When the pathway was blocked between putrescine and spermidine, ornithine decarboxylase synthesis rose 4-5-fold, regardless of the accumulation of putrescine. This indicates that spermidine is a specific signal for the repression of enzyme synthesis. When both putrescine and spermidine synthesis were reduced, the half-life of the enzyme rapidly increased 10-fold. The presence of either putrescine or spermidine restored the normal enzyme half-life of 55 min. Tests for an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitory protein (antizyme) were negative. The regulatory mechanisms activated by putrescine and spermidine account for most or all of the regulatory amplitude of this enzyme in N. crassa."
https://openalex.org/W1579442978,"The surface topography of IGF I(insulin-like growth factor I) was investigated by chemical modification of amino acid residues in free IGF I and bound to type I IGF receptor or to monoclonal antibody MAB43. Tyrosine residues were modified either by chloramine-T or lactoperoxidase catalyzed iodination. In the free IGF I molecule, all 3 tyrosine residues, A19 (Tyr-60), B25 (Tyr-24), and C2 (Tyr-31), were iodinated. Monoclonal antibody MAB43 protected IGF I against modification at tyrosine residue A19, and in the type I IGF receptor-IGF I complex, all 3 tyrosine residues were shielded against iodine incorporation. These results allow the prediction of the binding domains in the IGF I molecule. The minimal receptor binding site in IGF I would include amino acid residues B25 to C2 and, possibly, the C-terminal part of the A-domain with tyrosine residue A19."
https://openalex.org/W1652141592,"Plasminogen activation by tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is stimulated by fibrin. In a purified system maximal fibrin-enhanced plasmin formation occurs with a delay after an initial phase of slow plasmin formation (lag phase). In the present study purified stimulating CNBr-fragment FCB-2 of fibrinogen was used, and kinetics of plasminogen activation by t-PA were analyzed with respect to the lag phase. At constant FCB-2 concentration the duration of the lag phase decreased with increasing concentrations of t-PA and plasminogen. During this period the rate of plasmin formation/min increased linearly with time with a slope dependent on the initial concentrations of FCB-2, plasminogen, and t-PA. Plasmin pretreatment of FCB-2 resulted in a dose- and time-dependent shortening of the lag phase, and at plasmin concentrations greater than or equal to 1 nM and preincubation times greater than or equal to 3 min maximal plasmin formation occurred without a lag phase. Kinetics during the phase of maximal and constant plasmin formation were not influenced by plasmin pretreatment of FCB-2. We therefore conclude that maximal t-PA-dependent plasmin formation in a system stimulated by purified FCB-2 requires plasmin modification of FCB-2."

https://openalex.org/W1533177001,"Purified sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase was phosphorylated by either ATP or UTP under otherwise identical conditions. Calcium, pH, and nucleotide concentrations were adjusted to permit maximal steady-state accumulation of phosphoenzyme (EP). Either 4 or 8.5 nmol of EP/mg of protein were obtained with ATP or UTP, respectively. Tryptic digestion of phosphorylated ATPase followed by acid gel electrophoresis showed that EP from UTP was on fragment A1, similar to the report in the literature for EP from ATP. Phosphorylation with Pi in the absence of calcium gave EP levels similar to those obtained from UTP. Thus, comparison of EP levels from different substrates measured in parallel in the same preparation reveal that with ATP half of the sites are phosphorylated. Illumination of the ATPase with UV light in the presence of [3H]UTP caused photolabeling of the ATPase at a maximal level of 1 nmol of [3H]UTP incorporated/mg of ATPase. The UTP concentration dependence for photolabeling was the same as that for promoting catalysis. ATP when present in the illumination protected with a competitive pattern against photolabeling with UTP. Tryptic digestion and autoradiography of photolabeled ATPase revealed that UTP was covalently attached to tryptic fragment A2. The data indicate that a peptide sequence of fragment A2 is involved in the binding of the nucleoside moiety of UTP and possibly belongs to the nucleotide domain of the ATPase in addition to the sequence of fragment A1 which contains the phosphorylation residue."

https://openalex.org/W1526172417,"After binding to specific cell surface receptors, interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) along with its receptor is internalized by the cells. However, the physiological significance of the internalization of IFN is not known. We have found that the lectin concanavalin A (ConA), which does not inhibit the binding of 125I-rIFN-alpha A, inhibits both the internalization of 125I-rIFN-alpha A and the rIFN-alpha A-induced increase in the levels of 2',5'-oligo(A) synthetase mRNA and enzymatic activity in the B lymphoblastoid cell line Daudi. The reduced level of IFN-induced 2',5'-oligo(A) synthetase in ConA-treated cells was due neither to direct inhibition of the enzymatic activity nor to generalized inhibition of protein or RNA synthesis. The dose-response curves were similar for the effect of ConA to inhibit 125I-rIFN-alpha A internalization and 2',5'-oligo(A) synthetase induction. The correlation between the ConA-mediated inhibition of both 125I-rIFN-alpha A internalization and 2',5'-oligo(A) synthetase induction suggests that internalization of rIFN-alpha A plays a role in the responses to rIFN-alpha A. However, since ConA inhibits protein mobility in the plasma membrane, it is possible that ConA is also preventing aggregation of IFN receptors or interactions between IFN receptors and signal transducing proteins in the plasma membrane that may be necessary for responses to IFN."
https://openalex.org/W1575376210,"Abstract Transient but incomplete suppression of DNA synthesis by a single exposure of an asynchronous population of cells to 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FdUrd) increases the frequency of appearance of methotrexate (MTX)-resistant colonies. This increase was greater than 10-fold following a 6-h incubation of cells with 3 microM FdUrd prior to selection in MTX, an interval one-half the normal L1210 cell cycle time. During this period of exposure to FdUrd, DNA synthesis decreased to 25% of control rates and cells accumulated at the G1/S interface. The 6-h incubation with FdUrd resulted in greater than a 2.5-fold increase in the dihydrofolate reductase protein level in the treated cell population, which was accounted for, at least in part, by increased de novo synthesis of the enzyme as assessed by [35S]methionine labeling. This increase in dihydrofolate reductase was associated with a decrease in growth inhibition by MTX. A brief reversal (2 h) of FdUrd-induced DNA synthesis inhibition by the addition of thymidine eliminated the amplification of dihydrofolate reductase and the enhanced emergence of MTX-resistant clones. Beyond this, an analysis of clones that survive MTX selection indicates that the dihydrofolate reductase gene copy in cells spontaneously resistant to 50 nM MTX and those which resulted after the additional pretreatment with FdUrd for 6 h are comparable with a 2-4-fold amplification of enzyme in most clones. These studies demonstrate that FdUrd enhancement of dihydrofolate reductase expression can have a profound effect upon the incidence and expression of MTX resistance and that dihydrofolate reductase gene amplification may be another basis for antagonism between these agents."

https://openalex.org/W1583024319,"Radiation inactivation technique was employed to measure the functional size of adenosine triphosphatase of spinach chloroplasts. The functional size for acid-base-induced ATP synthesis was 450 +/- 24 kilodaltons; for phenazine methosulfate-mediated ATP synthesis, 613 +/- 33 kilodaltons; and for methanol-activated ATP hydrolysis, 280 +/- 14 kilodaltons. The difference (170 +/- 57 kilodaltons) between 450 +/- 24 and 280 +/- 14 kilodaltons is explained to be the molecular mass of proton channel (coupling factor 0) across the thylakoid membrane. Our data suggest that the stoichiometry of subunits I, II, and III of coupling factor 0 is 1:2:15. Ca2+- and Mg2+-ATPase activated by methanol, heat, and trypsin digestion have a similar functional size. However, anions such as SO3(2-) and CO3(2-) increased the molecular mass for both ATPase's (except trypsin-activated Mg2+-ATPase) by 12-30%. Soluble coupling factor 1 has a larger target size than that of membrane-bound. This is interpreted as the cold effect during irradiation."
