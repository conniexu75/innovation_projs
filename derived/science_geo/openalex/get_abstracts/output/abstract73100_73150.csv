https://openalex.org/W2046422192,The presence of extrachromosomal nucleoli in amphibian oocytes has permitted isolation and electron microscopic observation of the genes coding for ribosomal RNA precursor molecules. Visualization of these genes is possible because many precursor molecules are simultaneously synthesized on each gene. Individual genes are separated by stretches of DNA that apparently are not transcribed at the time of synthesis of precursor rRNA in the extrachromosomal nucleoli.
https://openalex.org/W1519300281,"Milk xanthine oxidase has been isolated in good yield and purity from pasteurized buttermilk and found to contain FAD, molybdenum, iron, and labile sulfide in the ratio of 1:1:4:4. Analytical data on the spectral characteristics of the enzyme in the oxidized and various reduced states are presented. The anaerobic reduction of the enzyme by substrates proceeds in two phases: a catalytically significant fast phase and a very much slower secondary phase. Anaerobic titration studies indicate that per eq of enzyme-bound FAD a 4-electron reduction occurs in the fast phase: 3 additional electrons may be accepted from substrates in the slow phase, and an 8th electron from dithionite. Rapid reaction studies indicate that, with all substrates tested, with the possible exception of purine, the rate-limiting step in catalysis is the 4-electron reduction of the enzyme, the reaction of the reduced enzyme with O2 being considerably more rapid."

https://openalex.org/W2110031253,"form of description, not of scattered facts but of the dynamic interrelations-the operating principlesfound in nature. Chomsky and his students have done this. Their aim has been to develop algorithms for specific languages, primarily English, that make explicit the series of computations that may account for the structure of sentences. The fact that these attempts have only been partially successful is irrelevant to the argument here. (Since every native speaker of English can tell a well-formed sentence from an illformed one, it is evident that some principles must exist; the question is merely whether the Chomskyites have discovered the correct ones.) The development of algorithms is only one province of mathematics, and in the eyes of many mathematicians a relatively limited one. There is a more exciting prospect; once we know sornething about the basic relational operating principles underlying a few languages, it should be possible to characterize formally the abstract system language as a whole. If our assumption of the existence of basic, structural language universals is correct, one ought to be able to adduce rigorous proof for the existence of homeomorphisms between any natural languages, that is, any of the systems characterized formally. If a category calculus were developed for this sort of thing, there would be one level of generality on which a common denominator could be found; this may be done trivially (for instance by using the product of all systems). However, our present knowledge of the relations, and the relations of relations, found in the languages so far investigated in depth encourages us to expect a significant solution. Environment and Maturation Everything in life, including behavior and language, is interaction of the individual with its milieu. But the milieu 9 MAY 1969 is not constant. The organism itself helps to shape it (this is true of cells and organs as much as of animals and man). Thus, the organism and its environment is a dynamic system and, phylogenetically, developed as such. The development of language in the child may be elucidated by applying to it the conceptual framework of developmental biology. Maturation may be characterized as a sequence of states. At each state, the growing organism is capable of accepting some specific input; this it breaks down and resynthesizes in such a way that it makes itself develop into a new state. This new state makes the organism sensitive to new and different types of input, whose acceptance transforms it to yet a further state, which opens the way to still different input, and so on. This is called epigenesis. It is the story of embryological development observable in the forniation of the body, as well as in certain aspects of behavior. At various epigenetic states, the organism may be susceptible to more than one sort of input-it may be susceptible to two or more distinct kinds or even to an infinite variety of inputs, as long as they are within determined limits-and the developmental history varies with the nature of the input accepted. In other words, the organism, during development, comes to crossroads; if condition A is present, it goes one way; if condition B is present, it goes another. We speak of states here, but this is, of course, an abstraction. Every stage of maturation is unstable. It is prone to change into specific directions, but requires a trigger from the environment. When language acquisition in the child is studied from the point of view of developmental biology, one makes an effort to describe developmental stages together with their tendencies for change and the conditions that bring about that change. I believe that the schema of physical maturation is applicable to the study of language development because children appear to be sensitive to successively different aspects of the language environment. The child first reacts only to intonation patterns. With continued exposure to these patterns as they occur in a given language, mechanisms develop that allow him to process the patterns, and in most instances to reproduce them (although the latter is not a necessary condition for further development). This changes him so that he reaches a new state, a new potential for language development. Now he becomes aware of certain articulatory aspects, can process them and possibly also reproduce them, and so on. A similar sequence of acceptance, synthesis, and state of new acceptance can be demonstrated on the level of semantics and syntax. That the embryological concepts of differentiation, as well as of determination and regulation, are applicable to the processes associated with language development is best illustrated by the material discussed above under the headings brain and critical age for language acquisition. Furthermore, the correlation between language development and other maturational indices suggests that there are anatornical and physiological processes whose maturation sets the pace for both cognitive and language development; it is to these maturational processes that the concept differentiation refers. We often transfer the meaning of the word to the verbal behavior itself, which is not unreasonable, although, strictly speaking, it is the physical correlates only that diffe~entiate."
https://openalex.org/W1580209949,"Glucose 1,6-diphosphate concentrations in 10 mouse tissues were found to range from 70 to 80 µmoles per kg in brain and red blood cells to 7 to 10 µmoles per kg in testes and pancreas. There was no discernible correlation between levels of glucose 1,6-diphosphate and levels of glucose 6-phosphate, uridine diphosphoglucose or phosphoglucomutase, or Michaelis constants of phosphoglucomutase for its coenzyme. Ischemia caused a rapid decrease in glucose 1,6-diphosphate level in brain, whereas there was little or no effect of starvation on the level in liver, or of maximal electrical stimulation on the level in muscle. Evidence is presented to show that glucose 1,6-di-P in muscle can be synthesized by P-glucomutase itself from fructose-1,6-di-P and glucose-6-P (or glucose-1-P). The rate of synthesis is only about 0.015% of the mutase rate for glucose-1-P, but this would be sufficient to synthesize the glucose-1,6-di-P in mouse muscle in 3 min. The equilibrium constant is about 12 for (fructose-1,6-di-P) (glucose-6-P):(fructose-6-P) (glucose-1,6-di-P)."
https://openalex.org/W2028524807,"Cell fusion experiments have been carried out with Chinese hamster cell mutants with different nutritional growth requirements. Conditions have been devised in which approximately 1 to 2 percent of the cell population remaining after fusion are fused, hybrid cells. The all-or-none nature of the genetic markers employed and the extremely low reversion rates insure that no contamination of the hybrid population with parental forms occurs. Hybrids between glycine- and hypoxanthine-requiring mutants are prototrophic, which indicates that both mutations are recessive. Hybrids between a glycine-deficient mutant and a singlestep mutant which requires glycine, hypoxanthine, and thymidine are relieved of the glycine dependency, an indication that the two loci associated with glycine dependence are different. This mutation to the triple-supplement requirement as well as a proline deficiency were also shown to be recessive mutations. The system appears applicable to a variety of genetic problems."

Living cells bind three times more tritiated actinomycin to euchromatin than to genetically inactive heterochromatin. Extraction of histone results in a general increase in tritiated actinomycin binding and in a ratio of the uptake in heterochromatin to that in euchromatin approaching unity.

https://openalex.org/W1521412495,"Abstract The mechanism of the stimulatory action of insulin on the transport of sugar across the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle cells was studied by kinetic analysis of the penetration of 3-O-methyl-d-glucose into isolated frog sartorius muscles. As part of this evaluation, the effects of trypsin and insulin were compared. Phospholipase C exerted a much smaller effect on permeability than either of these agents. Trypsin enhanced the initial rate of entry of 3-O-methylglucose into muscle cells. The changes in permeability that occurred during exposure of muscles to trypsin and during subsequent washing of the muscles with Ringer's solution followed a distinctly different time course from the pattern of response to insulin. Trypsin released nondialyzable sialic acid-containing material, tentatively assumed to be glycopeptides derived from the surface of the muscle cells, whereas insulin did not have this effect. The optimal concentration of trypsin was 2 µg per ml; higher concentrations tended to cause contractures. Trypsin did not increase permeability to d-mannitol. Despite differences in their mode of interaction with the cell, trypsin and insulin caused approximately the same maximal change in permeability to sugar, and their effects were not additive. Therefore, these agents appear to exert a selective stimulatory effect on the same transport system for sugar. Trypsin, like insulin, produced a marked increase in the Vmax of sugar transport without significantly altering the apparent Km for 3-O-methylglucose. Furthermore, the apparent Ki for phlorizin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-O-methylglucose penetration, was approximately the same whether or not the cells had been exposed to insulin. Thus, the intrinsic molecular properties of the carrier seem to be the same in stimulated and unstimulated cells. When the rate of entry of sugar was studied at different temperatures in control muscles and in muscles that had first been exposed to either insulin or trypsin under standarized conditions, the ratio of the rate of entry in stimulated muscles to the rate in control muscles fell as the temperature was raised. On the basis of these observations it has been postulated that insulin and trypsin may alter the structure of the membrane in a manner that permits sugar carriers to move more rapidly within the membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1550201741,"Abstract Soybean trypsin inhibitor could be partially reduced by treatment with 0.25 m sodium borohydride at 0° without loss of inhibitory activity toward trypsin. From the number of —SH groups released and the carboxymethylcysteine content of the carboxymethylated derivative, it was evident that two —SH groups had been produced under these conditions. A comparison of the diagonal electrophoretic maps of peptic digests of unmodified inhibitor, partially reduced and carboxymethylated inhibitor, and fully reduced and carboxymethylated inhibitor indicated that only one of the two disulfide bonds of the partially reduced derivative had been modified. Peptides in which the cystine residues had been converted to either cysteic acid or carboxymethylcysteinesulfone were isolated from the carboxymethylated derivatives of partially and fully reduced inhibitor. A comparison of their composition with the known sequence of amino acids surrounding the cystine residues of the inhibitor permitted the unequivocal identification of the disulfide bond which had been reduced by sodium borohydride."

The complete or partial amino acid sequences of these peptides have been established. From the overlaps in sequence between chymotryptic and tryptic peptides it is possible to place 124 of the 152 residues of human myoglobin in a unique sequence. The remaining residues have been ordered tentatively on the basis of the apparent homology in sequence between human and sperm whale myoglobins. Human myoglobin appears to contain 152 residues instead of 153 residues as found in whale myoglobin. The sequence of human myoglobin appears to be accommodated easily into the proposed three-dimensional structure of whale myoglobin, and large differences in the conformation of these two myoglobins cannot be expected."

https://openalex.org/W1516253947,"Abstract Because of its importance to an understanding of the mechanisms involved in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, the inhibitory properties of soybean trypsin inhibitor on this system were investigated. Kinetic studies showed that the inhibitor participates in a bimolecular reversible reaction with one of the components of the prothrombin-thrombin conversion system and to have an association constant dependent upon the rate of prothrombin conversion. With the use of three different systems for the activation of prothrombin, soybean trypsin inhibitor was found to block the conversion of the zymogen at two stages in the activation sequence. The first stage occurs during the initial peptide bond-breaking step which produces a polymorphic prothrombin intermediate plus a peptide fragment. The second point of inhibition occurs when this intermediate is split into smaller molecules, one of which has thrombin activity. Indirect evidence suggests that the proteolytic activity of thrombin is responsible for these initial events and that some of the bonds normally broken at these two stages are similar to bonds which have been implicated with the reactive site of soybean trypsin inhibitor. By the use of gel filtration columns equilibrated with buffers containing soybean trypsin inhibitor, it is possible to show that human or bovine thrombin (mol wt approximately 30,000 g) combines with soybean trypsin inhibitor (mol wt approximately 20,000 g) to form a mole for mole dissociable enzyme-inhibitor complex (mol wt approximately 50,000 g). This was confirmed by ultracentrifuge analysis. The complex thus formed is enzymatically active against fibrinogen (Arg-Gly bonds) and synthetic ester substrates but its formation is not affected when these catalytic properties are inhibited by sulfonation or alkylation of the residues at the active site of thrombin. Because of this, it is suggested that the mechanism of inhibition may be associated with alterations of secondary binding sites on the enzyme or with steric effects. From other experiments and for reasons which are discussed, these results cannot be explained on the basis of Factor X contamination of the thrombin preparations used. Although these studies do not dispute the possible interaction of soybean trypsin inhibitor with preparations having Factor X activity, they do not support the view that the inhibitor combines with intermediates or derivatives of the prothrombin-thrombin transition. Rather, these studies indicate that soybean trypsin inhibitor interacts with thrombin to block its specific proteolytic capacity to initiate prothrombin activation."

Each of the side chains reacts as expected if it is assumed that the conformation of human myoglobin closely resembles that of sperm whale myoglobin. The three methionyl side chains, which are expected to be buried, are not carboxymethylated unless the conformation of native myoglobin is disrupted. Carboxymethylation of the lysyl side chains proceeds without difficulty at the appropriate pH, a result in accord with the predicted location of these side chains on the surface of the molecule. Four of the 9 histidyl residues cannot be carboxymethylated in native human myoglobin. This is to be expected if certain of the imidazole side chains are involved in internal bonding as in the case of sperm whale myoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1485528728,"The mode of action of the extracellular α-mannosidase from Arthrobacter GJM-1 has been studied with several yeast mannans as substrates. In vitro, the enzyme cleaves most of the α-(1 → 2)- and α-(1 → 3)-linked side chains from Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan, producing free mannose and leaving a resistant polymer containing mainly α-(1 → 6)-linkages. This material cannot be further degraded by the enzyme. The extent to which mannans from several Candida species are digested by the enzyme is inversely proportional to their phosphorus content. Kloeckera brevis mannan, although highly phosphorylated, is extensively digested by the enzyme. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear, but it may be related to the positions of the phosphate residues in the respective mannans. Growth of Arthrobacter GJM-1 on S. cerevisiae mannan results in the accumulation of an undigested residue in the cultural filtrate. This residue remains in the supernatant after ammonium sulfate precipitation of the α-mannosidase. It has been purified by gel filtration and precipitation with Fehling's solution. The structure of this residue has been studied by acetolysis, proton magnetic resonance spectrometry, and methylation. These studies indicate that the product is exclusively α-(1 → 6)-linked and represents the mannan backbone. The data suggest that the α-mannosidase from Arthrobacter GJM-1 is an exoglycosidase which acts by splitting off single mannose residues from the nonreducing ends of the side chains of the mannan molecule. Sodium borotritide reduction of the mannan residue from the cultural filtrate (RCF) of the Arthrobacter results in the incorporation of tritium into the polymer. Hydrolysis of the labeled RCF yields radioactive mannitol. A comparison of the amount of label incorporated into RCF with that incorporated into mannotetraose under the same conditions allows a calculation of the molecular weight of RCF, the value being 7100. The methylation end group data suggest a value of 6500, while a figure of 8100 was obtained by high speed sedimentation equilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W2139821373,"Abstract Incorporation of radioactive amino acids into the α, β, and γ chains of human hemoglobin was studied with erythroid cells from newborn infants. When the cells were incubated in isoleucine-free medium together with l-O-methylthreonine, which is an antagonist of l-isoleucine, inhibition of γ chain synthesis occurred. The concomitant synthesis of α and β chains, which do not contain isoleucine, was not significantly affected. Inhibition of γ chain synthesis by as much as 90% had virtually no effect on the synthesis of complementary α chains, suggesting that the synthesis or release of α chains does not require prior synthesis of these non-α chains. As a result of the selective inhibition of synthesis of γ chains, cells incubated with the isoleucine antagonist synthesized a 2- to 3-fold excess of α chains over the total non-α chains. A major portion of the excess α chains was present in the cell lysates uncombined with hemoglobin, and had Sephadex gel filtration properties consistent with their being present as α dimers. When βa subunits were added to the lysates prior to Sephadex gel filtration, the excess α chain radioactivity appeared in the hemoglobin fraction, suggesting that the free α chains existed as completed globin-heme subunits which retained the capacity to combine with complementary subunits to form hemoglobin. When cells were incubated with l-O-methylthreonine and a radioactive amino acid in label-chase experiments, followed by 24-hour incubations, the excess radioactive α chains remained in the soluble cell fraction. This was in contrast with reported studies with β-thalassemia cells in which α chain precipitation was demonstrated during cell incubations in vitro. This difference appeared to be the result of intracellular exchange of the radioactive α chains with α chains of preexisting hemoglobin in the cells incubated with l-O-methylthreonine, a reaction which may be undetectable in β-thalassemia cells because of the presence of a preexisting pool of nonradioactive α chains in these cells."

Incubation of methyl [17-18O]hydroxyoleate with whole cells and of methyl oleate in the presence of 18O2 or H218O showed that the oxygen atom, introduced on hydroxylation, is not lost on glycoside formation and that it is derived from molecular oxygen and not from water. Esters of [18-2H3], [16,18-2H5], [17-2H2], [17-d-2H], and [17-l-2H]octadecanoates have been synthesized. On incubation of these compounds no deuterium atoms at C-16 and C-18 are removed but the 17-l-deuterium atom is lost. Unsaturated intermediates are, therefore, most probably not involved and 17-l-hydroxy acid is produced by displacement of an l-hydrogen atom (retention of configuration). The rate of formation of glycoside from l-deuterostearate was less than half of that from d-deuterostearate or from unlabeled stearate, suggesting the operation of a primary isotope effect."

Exposure to released males on the third night produced marked acidophilic degranulation resulting in a significant decline in pituitary acidophils to 38.0 percent. These findings support the view that female pheromone suppresses and male pheromone favors the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone and indicate that luteotrophic hormone is secreted at its assigned time in the sequence of cyclic ovarian events initiated by the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone.
