https://openalex.org/W1576399086,"Abstract A protein kinase that catalyzes an adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent phosphorylation of casein and protamine has been purified from rabbit skeletal muscle. The Km values of cyclic AMP for these reactions are 1 x 10-7 and 6 x 10-8 m, respectively. The protein kinase markedly increases the rate of the cyclic AMP-dependent activation and phosphorylation of phosphorylase kinase by ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1545162664,"In the presence of diphtheria toxin, the adenosine diphosphate ribose portion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide was transferred to aminoacyl transferase II obtained from rat liver. The reaction resulted in a concurrent inactivation of this particular enzyme, one of the supernatant factors which assemble amino acids into polypeptide chain. The linkage of ADP-ribose to aminoacyl transferase II appeared to be of covalent nature. The reaction was reversible. Diptheria toxin may act as an enzyme or a catalytic cofactor in this reaction."

A methylene hydroxylase system from camphor induced Pseudomonas putida strain C1 cells has been separated into three fractions: a putidaredoxin reductase, putidaredoxin (an iron-sulfur protein), and a hydroxylase (shown to be a soluble cytochrome P-450). 2. This system of enzymes catalyzes the hydroxylation of methylene carbon 5 of camphor with reduced disphosphopyridine nucleotide as a primary electron donor and molecular oxygen as acceptor. 3. The redoxin serves as the electron carrier from the reduced pyridine nucleotide and reductase to the cytochrome P-450-substrate complex. 4. The coupling of the hydroxylase (P-450) to the reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide dehydrogenase (reductase), and the putidaredoxin is demonstrated, and substrate is shown to be required for the over-all reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1579514899,"Abstract A method of purification of a vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein from chick intestinal mucosa is described. The purification procedure involved the use of ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, and preparative disc electrophoresis. The assay system for calcium-binding protein is based upon the competition between calcium-binding protein and an ion exchange resin for added 45Ca. An equation linearly relating binding protein concentration to binding activity is given. Sedimentation velocity and gel filtration behavior indicated that the product was homogeneous with respect to size. Two acrylamide gel systems gave single bands, whereas a third showed the presence of a possible degradation product in addition to calcium-binding protein. The molecular weight of calcium-binding protein was found to be about 2.8 x 104 by calibrated gel filtration and about 2.5 x 104 by equilibrium sedimentation (assumed partial specific volume = 0.72). The formation constants between calcium-binding protein and calcium, strontium, and barium were 2.6 x 105 m-1, 3.9 x 104 m-1, and 5.8 x 103 m-1, respectively, and it appears that 1 mole of protein binds 1 atom of calcium. Preliminary analysis of the composition of the protein is reported."
https://openalex.org/W1541806403,"Abstract The effect of some physiological and nutritional variables on the vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein content of duodenal mucosa of chicks was assessed. Calcium-binding protein, originally detected in vitamin D3-treated rachitic chicks, is also present in normally raised chicks; however, the concentration of calcium-binding protein in the vitamin D3-treated rachitic chick mucosa exceeded that in normal mucosa. 47Ca absorption by a duodenal loop and the calcium-binding protein content of duodenal mucosa decreased at a similar rate when chicks given a single dose of vitamin D3 were replaced on a rachitogenic diet. Chicks adapted to a low calcium intake absorbed more calcium and had a greater concentration of duodenal calcium-binding protein than chicks on a normal diet. Further, content of mucosal calcium-binding protein was greater in younger than more mature birds, the same in pullets and cockerels of the same age, and greater in laying than in nonlaying hens. Estrogen (diethylstilbesterol), a hormone prominent in the process of egg laying, did not induce the formation of calcium-binding protein. Vitamin D3 was more effective in calcium-binding protein formation than vitamin D2 which fact coincides with their relative physiological effects. The relationship between these studies and the implication of a role of calcium-binding protein in calcium translocation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1484131773,"Abstract Emetine is rapidly concentrated from the media by suspension cultures of HeLa cells, and it inhibits protein biosynthesis by 50% at a concentration in the media of 4 x 10-8 m. The synthesis of DNA is partially inhibited by emetine, but the primary effect of the alkaloid in HeLa cells appears to be on the biosynthesis of protein. In contrast to the effects of cycloheximide, the effects of emetine on DNA and protein synthesis are irreversible. Synthesis of host cell RNA is unaffected by emetine, but viral RNA synthesis in poliovirus-infected HeLa cells is inhibited by this drug. Emetine prevents the breakdown of polyribosomes induced by puromycin but does not affect the puromycin-induced release of nascent peptide. The observations reported in this paper provide a biochemical basis for the toxic and therapeutic properties of emetine."

https://openalex.org/W1993219891,"An enzyme that hydrolyzes cyclic ',5'-adenosine monophosphate to 5'-adenosine monophosphate was found in the culture medium of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoidum. The enzymatic activity shows a pH optimum of 7.5, and magnesium is required for maximum activity. The enzyme is not inhibited by caffeine. It has a Michaelis-Menten constant of 2 x 10(-3)M and its molecular weight is around 300,000."
https://openalex.org/W2417923437,An enzyme associated with mammalian chromatin catalyzed the transfer of the adenosine diphosphate ribose moiety of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to histone with the simultaneous release of nicotinamide. A successive transfer of the ADP-ribose moiety resulted in the formation and elongation of a homopolymer with repeating ADP-ribose units. Quantitative analysis of the reaction product showed a variety of molecular size distribution from a monomer up to polymers composed of several ADP-ribose units. The polymer as well as the monomer of ADP-ribose was presumably linked to histone through a covalent bond. Deoxyribonucleic acid appeared to be required for chain elongation of the polymer.
https://openalex.org/W1572073077,"Abstract A decapeptide containing 1 eq of adenylyl groups bound in phosphodiester linkage has been isolated in high yield from adenylylated glutamine synthetase. The decapeptide has the following amino acid composition: (Asp2, Glu2, Pro3, Gly1, Leu1, Tyr1). Tyrosine is the only amino acid present that could yield a phosphodiester derivative having the stability characteristics of the adenylylated peptide. Evidence that the adenylyl group is in fact bound in phosphodiester linkage to the phenolic hydroxyl group of tyrosine was obtained by comparing the ultraviolet absorption spectra of adenylylated and unadenylylated peptides at alkaline pH. A spectral peak, attributable to ionization of tyrosine hydroxyl groups, was absent in the adenylylated peptide, but became apparent when the adenylyl residues were removed with snake venom phosphodiesterase. The results suggest that a unique tyrosyl residue in glutamine synthetase is the site of adenylylation of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1577169345,"Ornithine aminotransferase accumulated in rat liver and kidney during the first 2 months of life and to twice as high a level in the female as in male kidney. Ovariectomy prevented the appearance of this sex difference and the administration of estrogen enhanced the developmental formation of the enzyme in kidney (and to a lesser extent in liver) in both sexes. Castration of the male or the administration of testosterone to either sex had no effect on ornithine aminotransferase. Estrogen given to intact adult female rats further increased the enzyme in kidney and ovariectomy reduced it to that found in males. Adult kidney, liver, and intestine contained higher activities of ornithine aminotransferase than regenerating liver and six other normal tissues examined. Fetal liver and kidney and fast growing undifferentiated tumors contained low activities, while slow growing hepatomas contained more. Pyridoxal phosphate needs to be added to obtain maximal activity in quantitative assays of ornithine aminotransferase in some rat tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1531546648,"Abstract The dietary regulation of fatty acid synthesis de novo in two transplantable hepatomas, 7777 and 9618A, has been studied by comparison of the acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase activities of tumor and host liver, both in animals fasted 48 hours and in those subsequently refed a fat-free diet for 48 hours. Neither acetyl-CoA carboxylase nor fatty acid synthetase of these hepatomas was subject to the changes in enzyme concentration normally observed in host liver following dietary alteration. Thus, in livers of refed animals acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity was 12- to 29-fold greater than in the livers of fasted animals. Neither tumor studied showed any change in enzyme levels upon refeeding 48-hour fasted animals; 1.4 mµmoles of malonyl-CoA were formed per mg per min for hepatoma 7777 and 3.3 mµmoles of malonyl-CoA were formed per mg per min for hepatoma 9618A. These activities of enzyme are 5- to 10-fold greater than fasting levels in host liver. Fatty acid synthetase levels in host livers increased 12- to 20-fold after refeeding. Again, neither tumor showed significant changes in enzyme activity upon refeeding fasted animals. Both acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase from hepatoma were inhibited by palmityl-CoA despite their lack of response to dietary alteration. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase was purified 164-fold from rat liver and 67-fold from hepatoma 7777 to define further this lack of regulation. Studies of the purified enzymes disclosed that the tumor enzyme was essentially identical with that derived from liver in terms of heat inactivation, affinities for acetyl-CoA and ATP, activation and aggregation by citrate, product inhibition by malonyl-CoA, pH optima, and intrinsic specific activity as determined from biotin content. These experiments suggest that the acetyl-CoA carboxylase from the tumors is the same enzyme as that from host liver, and that the increased activity in the tumors is due to an increased amount of enzyme rather than a structurally altered enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2047874688,"Chick and mouse cell monolayers treated with interferon were significantly protected from destruction by toxoplasma. The results suggest that fewer numbers of organisms were released from interferon-treated cells. Interferons were uniformly more active in a viral assay than in a toxoplasma assay, and they had the same properties in both assays. The data suggest that interferon activity may be directed against organisms phylogenetically higher than viruses."
https://openalex.org/W1596263923,"Mature rat brain mitochondria and microsomes incorporated acetyl coenzyme A and malonyl coenzyme A into a variety of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids by a chain elongation mechanism. ATP and a reduced pyridine nucleotide were required for this process. Malonyl-CoA was found to be the active precursor in fatty acid biosynthesis by the microsomal elongation system, while both malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA were active precursors in mitochondria. Microsomes incorporated malonyl-CoA mainly into 18:0 (33% of the total radioactivity) and into polyunsaturated fatty acids, 22:4 and 22:6 (about 60% of the total). The main synthetic products for the mitochondrial acetyl-CoA system were 20:1 (about 38%), 18:0 (18%), and the polyunsaturated fatty acids, 22:4 and 22:6 (about 20%). When incubated with malonyl-CoA in the absence of ATP, both particulate fractions synthesized only 14:0, 16:0, and 18:0 by a mechanism de novo. The decarboxylation ratios in the complete system suggest, however, that in brain, unlike in liver, synthesis de novo is not the major metabolic route of fatty acid synthesis. A significant amount of the fatty acids synthesized by microsomes and mitochondria were incorporated into phospholipids, as well as into triglycerides, cholesterol, and cholesterol esters. The myelin fraction was almost completely inactive with respect to fatty acid synthesis in vitro. This finding may reflect the low myelin turnover of mature animals."
https://openalex.org/W1604098757,"Abstract Initial rate kinetic studies of mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, an enzyme previously shown to have a compulsory order (at pH 8.0 in 0.05 m Tris-acetate buffer), show that the zero order maximum initial velocity and the oxidized coenzyme dissociation constant (determined as a product inhibitor) decrease concomitantly when ketomalonate is substituted for oxalacetate as the substrate. Since substrate or product molecules are not present on the enzyme intermediate complex from which the coenzyme dissociates in the rate-determining step in the simple compulsory order mechanism, a more complex reciprocating compulsory order mechanism is proposed. The latter accounts for the influence of substrate structure through the participation of two identical enzyme subunits, each with a coenzyme- and substrate-binding site, which interact through substrate structure-dependent conformational changes in the enzyme. The modified can account for the influence of substrate structure on maximum initial velocity, the altered DPN dissociation constant, and inhibition of the reaction by hydroxymalonate and oxalacetate. It is speculated that the more complex model may be related to autocontrol of the enzyme under physiological conditions by the reaction product oxalacetate. Also, reciprocal interactions may relate to the conservation of free energy change accompanying substrate binding by coupling two reaction cycles."
https://openalex.org/W1570964021,"Abstract 1. We have tested the hypothesis that insulin might decrease the levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in rat epididymal adipose tissue by stimulating the activity of a cAMP phosphodiesterase. 2. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (DBcAMP) was comparable to cAMP as a substrate for cAMP phosphodiesterase of adipose tissue; the hydrolysis of both cylic nucleotides was inhibited by theophylline. 3. DBcAMP, but not cAMP, was strongly lipolytic in free adipose cells; this activity was unaffected by insulin in vitro at concentrations of the hormone sufficient to be strongly antilipolytic against epinephrine. DBcAMP-stimulated lipolysis was inhibited by nicotinic acid, a stimulator of cAMP phosphodiesterase. 4. Lipolytic concentrations of theophylline and caffeine synergistically stimulated the lipolytic effect of DBcAMP in free adipose cells at all but saturating levels of DBcAMP. Lower, nonlipolytic concentrations of the methyl xanthines also stimulated the lipolytic activity of DBcAMP, and this synergism was reversed by insulin, but only at low concentrations of the cyclic nucleotide. 5. Neither prior treatment of fat pads with insulin nor the presence of insulin during enzyme assay affected the cAMP phosphodiesterase activities of 2000 x g sediment and supernatant fractions. 6. Neither hypo- nor hyperinsulinism in donor rats influenced the cAMP phosphodiesterase activity of adipose tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1529479075,"Abstract An NAD-specific glutamate dehydrogenase has been isolated from Blastocladiella emersonii, purified over 100-fold, and some of its kinetic parameters studied. Saturation kinetic curves with NAD+ as variable substrate were largely sigmoidal at high substrate concentrations. Saturation plots for glutamate were hyperbolic except at low NAD+ levels when glutamate activated the reaction. Double reciprocal velocity plots were nonlinear. The intense substrate activation by high levels of NAD+ and glutamate described a biphasic character in diagnostic reciprocal plots. On the other hand, the substrates, NADH and α-ketoglutarate, at high levels, were strongly inhibitory, and the reciprocal plots for NADH oxidation were also nonlinear. AMP and ADP changed the kinetic parameters so that the biphasic plots were linearized. However, substrate inhibition plots for NADH and α-ketoglutarate remained unchanged. A further consequence of AMP modulation was elimination of the activation constant (Kmm2) for NAD+ and an increase in the Michaelis constant for NADH. In addition, the reaction rate increased in both directions of the reaction. ATP and guanosine di- and triphosphates were negative allosteric effectors. In sucrose density gradients, the enzyme probably dissociates into subunits or monomers with consequent loss of enzymatic activity. Purine and pyridine nucleotides (AMP, ADP, NAD+) served as stabilizing allosteric ligands and prevented this inactivation. Enzymes inactivated by sedimentation could be fully reactivated by incubation with AMP. The molecular weight of the protein was calculated as 230,000 ± 20,000. A molecular model of the kinetic mechanism that may be operative in this enzyme is proposed. The adenylate control hypothesis is invoked to explain a probable physiological regulatory feature of this enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1500406041,"Abstract Aldehyde oxidase from rabbit liver was studied by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Reduction by substrate elicited three types of signals characteristic of free radicals, molybdenum(V), and a non-heme iron complex, respectively. The properties of these signals are described, and the representation of each species in the corresponding signal is quantitatively assessed. Under the specific conditions which yielded a maximum for each of the signal types, 24% of the flavin was in the semiquinone form (g = 2.00), 25% of the iron was in the reduced form responsible for the signal of g = 1.94, and 15 to 20% of the molybdenum was in the Mo(V) state with a signal at g = 1.97. Anaerobic titration of the enzyme with dithionite indicated that reduction of only 1 iron out of each 4 (per flavin) results in the appearance of the g = 1.94 signal, in agreement with the quantitative recovery in the EPR signal. When titration of the enzyme with N-methylnicotinamide was followed by EPR spectroscopy, partial formation of flavin semiquinone and accumulation of reducing equivalents in the non-heme iron complex was observed during consumption of the first 5 to 6 electrons per flavin. Extensive reduction of molybdenum ensued after an additional 1 to 2 eq. Spectrophotometry suggests that the enzymic components which accept electrons from substrate and are not detectable by EPR spectroscopy are that portion of the flavin which is fully reduced and the remainder of the non-heme iron. Rapid titrations, insufficient to permit equilibration between enzyme and substrate, showed migration of reducing equivalents from molybdenum toward flavin and non-heme iron with increasing time. These experiments show that intramolecular electron transfer can be effectively stopped at a low temperature. Measurements of electron spin relaxation of reduced enzyme suggest intramolecular magnetic interactions among the various paramagnetic species generated during the titrations."

https://openalex.org/W2048193798,Carbon dioxide from calcium carbonate in fossil bone can be selectively separated from carbon dioxide in bone apatite by hydrolyzing the sample first in acetic acid and then in hydrochloric acid. Radiocarbon analyses of the inorganic carbon dioxide in three samples of known age clearly show calcium carbonate in fossil bone to be secondary and the carbonate of bone apatite to be indigenous and suitable for dating in some cases. Agreement between dates on collagen-bone apatite pairs increases the level of confidence.

The activity of the enzyme is stimulated about 2-fold by magnesium chloride and by diethyl ether. The activity of the enzyme is completely inhibited by 10-3 m ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or 10-3 m calcium chloride. Lysolecithin and dipalmitoyl lecithin are hydrolyzed at about 10% of the rate of sphingomyelin. No hydrolysis of phosphatidylserine, phosphatidyl-ethanolamine, or phosphatidylinositol is detected. The enzyme does not catalyze the exchange of phosphorylcholine-14C into sphingomyelin."

Enzyme concentrations in homogenates of groups of cells and in single identified cells indicate that neurons which function as neurosecretory cells, and which do not form chemical synapses with other cells or with peripheral structures, have little or no ability to synthesize acetylcholine; neurons which are involved in visceromotor integrations, and which connect with each other or with the periphery, have a substantial concentration of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1529906026,"Abstract The kinetics of appearance and disappearance of the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals of aldehyde oxidase under various conditions were studied by a rapid freezing technique. Electron spin relaxation of the paramagnetic flavin and molybdenum species was monitored during these experiments. The kinetics of reduction and reoxidation of molybdenum, iron, and flavin, revealed by EPR measurements, were compatible with the participation of these substances in the normal catalytic cycle of this enzyme. In the steady state molybdenum is partly reduced, whereas the iron and flavin components are largely oxidized. Hence, reduction of molybdenum and oxidation of flavin and iron are relatively rapid reactions. No unambiguous evidence for a linear sequence of electron carriers was obtained, but a sequence of electron transfer from substrate to molybdenum, flavin, and iron is compatible with most results. The results of the electron spin relaxation measurements indicate a multiplicity of subtile interactions among the electron carriers involved, dependent on time of reaction, type of substrate, and degree of reduction. The multiple complexities in the reaction patterns of enzymes incorporating several electron carriers, as they become apparent in studies of the kind presented here, are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1518919265,"Abstract 1. Insulin stimulated the incorporation of 32P-labeled inorganic phosphate into acid-soluble mononucleotides in isolated fat cells incubated in the absence of glucose in the medium. The specific radioactivity of the ATP increased by approximately 60%. 2. This increase was accompanied by a small but significant increment in steady state concentration of ATP over control. 3. Experiments with previously labeled cells, incubated in the absence of phosphate in the incubation medium, suggest that this stimulation by insulin of mononucleotide labeling was not a result of an effect of insulin on active transport across the plasma membrane. 4. Lipolytic agents, which are known to increase the concentration of cyclic AMP in adipose cells, diminished the incorporation of 32Pi into monucleotides. They also decreased ATP concentration, suggesting that fatty acids, their derivatives, or an unknown factor connected with lipolysis impaired oxidative phosphorylation. Insulin diminished the inhibitory action of lipolytic agents and restored ATP concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1514163703,"Abstract The flavin semiquinone form of thioredoxin reductase can be produced in high yield either by photoirradiation in the presence of excess ethylenediaminetetraacetate or, much more rapidly, by exposure of partially reduced enzyme to light. Extinction coefficients of the semiquinone have been derived at critical wave lengths. The semiquinone forms produced are of the blue type, i.e. they are neutral semiquinones. Electron paramagnetic resonance determinations confirm the free radical nature of the species. Two different spectra of the semiquinone have been observed. The shift from one type to the other can be effected in several ways; evidence is given which indicates that the shift in the semiquinone band is due to a change in the environment of the flavin moiety determined by the reduction state of the second oxido-reductively active group of thioredoxin reductase, a disulfide bridge. The flavin semiquinone of this enzyme cannot be reoxidized by thioredoxin or reduced by TPNH, and thus cannot be involved in the catalytic reaction."

The manganese enzyme was crystallized by dialysis against distilled water. The Mn enzyme formed well defined complexes with fluoride and azide. However, neither the Mn enzyme nor its dithionite-reduced compound formed complexes with CO and cyanide. The Mn enzyme was allowed to react with hydroperoxide to form a relatively stable peroxide compound which exhibited an intense electron paramagnetic resonance absorption of a free radical type at g = 2.003. The Mn enzyme and its derivatives thus far examined showed no electron paramagnetic resonance absorption attributable to Mn at -196°. The Mn enzyme catalyzed the peroxidatic oxidation of ferrocyanide, ferrocytochrome c, and ascorbate at reasonable rates."
