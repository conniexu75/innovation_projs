Thus, our model proposes a framework for understanding key features of the architecture of complex traits. During the past 12 years, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been used to study the genetic basis for a wide variety of complex traits ranging from diseases such as diabetes, Crohn’s disease, and schizophrenia to quantitative traits such as lipid levels, height, and educational attainment (Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007Wellcome Trust Case Control ConsortiumGenome-wide association study of 14,000 cases of seven common diseases and 3,000 shared controls.Nature. 2007; 447: 661-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (7776) Google Scholar). These studies have identified thousands of genetic loci associated with diverse complex traits, and in some cases, it has been possible to dissect the molecular mechanisms that link the identified GWAS variants to disease (Claussnitzer et al., 2015Claussnitzer M. Dankel S.N. Kim K.H. Quon G. Meuleman W. Haugen C. Glunk V. Sousa I.S. Beaudry J.L. Puviindran V. et al.FTO Obesity Variant Circuitry and Adipocyte Browning in Humans.N. Engl. J.

Nonetheless, early practitioners of GWASs were surprised to find that even the strongest GWAS hits tend to have modest effect sizes on risk and that all the genome-wide significant hits in combination explained only a small fraction of the expected genetic component of risk (Manolio et al., 2009Manolio T.A. Collins F.S. Cox N.J. Goldstein D.B. Hindorff L.A. Hunter D.J. McCarthy M.I. Ramos E.M. Cardon L.R. Chakravarti A. et al.Finding the missing heritability of complex diseases.Nature. 2009; 461: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (5883) Google Scholar). For example, the 18 genome-wide significant loci for type 2 diabetes identified by 2010 explained just 6% of the expected heritability; for height, the 40 genome-wide significant loci explained just 5% of the heritability (Manolio et al., 2009Manolio T.A. Collins F.S. Cox N.J. Goldstein D.B. Hindorff L.A. Hunter D.J. McCarthy M.I. Ramos E.M. Cardon L.R. Chakravarti A. et al.Finding the missing heritability of complex diseases.Nature. 2009; 461: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (5883) Google Scholar). Since then, the fractions of heritability explained by genome-wide significant loci have only increased modestly, even with much larger sample sizes and many more significant loci (Shi et al., 2016Shi H.

Genet. 2016; 99: 139-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The observation that genome-wide significant loci only capture a small proportion of the expected genetic heritability became known as the problem of “missing heritability.” Subsequent work has largely resolved this initial mystery by showing that most of the missing heritability is due to large numbers of small-effect common variants that are not significant at current sample sizes (Purcell et al., 2009Purcell S.M.

While the initial mystery has been resolved, the resolution led to another surprising finding: the large numbers of small-effect variants tend to be spread extremely widely across the genome and implicate a considerable fraction of all genes expressed in relevant tissues. Indeed, for many traits, most of the genome contributes to heritability (Purcell et al., 2009Purcell S.M. Wray N.R. Stone J.L. Visscher P.M. O’Donovan M.C. Sullivan P.F. Sklar P. Ruderfer D.M. McQuillin A. Morris D.W. et al.International Schizophrenia ConsortiumCommon polygenic variation contributes to risk of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.Nature. 2009; 460: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (3442) Google Scholar). For example, between 71% and 100% of 1 megabase (Mb) windows in the genome are estimated to contribute to the heritability of schizophrenia (Loh et al., 2015Loh P.-R. Bhatia G. Gusev A. Finucane H.K. Bulik-Sullivan B.K. Pollack S.J. de Candia T.R. Lee S.H. Wray N.R.

Genet. 2015; 47: 1385-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Similarly, a recent study of polygenic prediction models found that for most of the diseases studied, the models achieved peak accuracies when assuming that 0.1%–1% of common SNPs have causal effects (Khera et al., 2018Khera A.V. Chaffin M. Aragam K.G. Haas M.E. Roselli C. Choi S.H. Natarajan P. Lander E.S. Lubitz S.A. Ellinor P.T. Kathiresan S. Genome-wide polygenic scores for common diseases identify individuals with risk equivalent to monogenic mutations.Nat. Genet. 2018; 50: 1219-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). We recently argued that the data suggest a large fraction of all genes expressed in relevant tissues can affect a phenotype and that much of the trait variance is mediated through genes that are not directly involved in the trait in question (Boyle et al., 2017aBoyle E.A. Li Y.I. Pritchard J.K. An Expanded View of Complex Traits: From Polygenic to Omnigenic.Cell. 2017; 169: 1177-1186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). These observations appear at odds with conventional ways of understanding the links from genotype to phenotype. Indeed, much of the progress in classical genetics has come from detailed molecular work to dissect the biological mechanisms of individual mutations. That work is predicated on the expectation that there is a relatively direct molecular pathway from genotype to phenotype. Yet the genetic basis of complex traits is highly diffuse, and it remains unclear how we should conceptualize the molecular mapping from genotype to phenotype. Specifically, the data suggest several key questions:Why does such a large portion of the genome contribute to heritability?Why do the lead hits for a typical trait contribute so little to heritability?What factors determine the effect sizes of SNPs on traits? In this paper, we develop a statistical model to explore these questions. Our model necessarily simplifies a more complex reality and elides specific details of biology and genetic architecture that vary across traits. Nonetheless, we believe it is essential for the field to develop conceptual models for understanding complex trait architecture, and the model proposed here is a step in that direction. The central thesis of the present paper is that known properties of cis- and trans-regulatory effects (i.e., cis and trans expression- or protein-quantitative trait loci [eQTLs and pQTLs, respectively]) provide essential clues to understanding key features of the architecture of complex traits. As discussed in our previous paper (Boyle et al., 2017aBoyle E.A. Li Y.I. Pritchard J.K. An Expanded View of Complex Traits: From Polygenic to Omnigenic.Cell. 2017; 169: 1177-1186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar), a conceptual model of complex traits should allow for the following observations:1.The most important loci contribute only a modest fraction of the total heritability (Shi et al., 2016Shi H. Kichaev G. Pasaniuc B. Contrasting the genetic architecture of 30 complex traits from summary association data.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2016; 99: 139-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, for many traits the most significant signals are located near genes that make functional sense. This has been established both by detailed molecular dissection of top hits as well as by enrichment analyses of significant loci (although the strength of enrichment is generally modest and varies among traits) (Jostins et al., 2012Jostins L.

Stephens M. Large-scale genome-wide enrichment analyses identify new trait-associated genes and pathways across 31 human phenotypes.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 4361Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).2.The bulk of the heritability can be attributed to a huge number of common variants with very small effect sizes. Moreover, these variants tend to be spread very broadly across the genome (Loh et al., 2015Loh P.-R. Bhatia G. Gusev A. Finucane H.K. Bulik-Sullivan B.K. Pollack S.J. de Candia T.R. Lee S.H. Wray N.R. Kendler K.S. et al.Schizophrenia Working Group of Psychiatric Genomics ConsortiumContrasting genetic architectures of schizophrenia and other complex diseases using fast variance-components analysis.Nat. Genet. 2015; 47: 1385-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). For traits such as schizophrenia and height, analyses suggest that as many as half of all SNPs may be in linkage disequilibrium with causal variants (Boyle et al., 2017aBoyle E.A. Li Y.I. Pritchard J.K. An Expanded View of Complex Traits: From Polygenic to Omnigenic.Cell. 2017; 169: 1177-1186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar).3.Consistent with the latter observations, genes with putatively relevant functions (e.g., neuronal functions for schizophrenia and immune functions for Crohn’s disease) contribute only slightly more to the heritability than do random genes, as measured on a per-SNP basis. While gene functional annotations are imperfect, it is worth noting that other kinds of experiments, such as genome-scale CRISPR screens, often yield much stronger functional enrichments than seen in most GWAS data (Bassik et al., 2013Bassik M.C.

Genet. 2018; 50: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The clearest functional pattern is that genes not expressed in relevant cell types do not contribute significantly to heritability (Boyle et al., 2017aBoyle E.A. Li Y.I. Pritchard J.K. An Expanded View of Complex Traits: From Polygenic to Omnigenic.Cell. 2017; 169: 1177-1186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar).4.Similarly, the per-SNP heritability in tissue-specific regulatory elements is only modestly increased relative to SNPs in broadly active regulatory elements, provided that they are active in relevant tissues (Boyle et al., 2017aBoyle E.A. Li Y.I. Pritchard J.K. An Expanded View of Complex Traits: From Polygenic to Omnigenic.Cell. 2017; 169: 1177-1186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Thus, various lines of evidence indicate that the heritability of a typical complex trait is driven by variation in a large number of regulatory elements and genes, spread widely across the genome, and mediated through a wide range of gene functional categories.5.For most complex traits, the heritability is dominated by common variants (Shi et al., 2016Shi H. Kichaev G. Pasaniuc B. Contrasting the genetic architecture of 30 complex traits from summary association data.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2016; 99: 139-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, Yang et al., 2010Yang J. Benyamin B. McEvoy B.P. Gordon S. Henders A.K. Nyholt D.R. Madden P.A. Heath A.C.

Evidence for Weak Selective Constraint on Human Gene Expression.Genetics. 2019; 211: 757-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). While rare variants with large effect sizes do exist for some complex traits, and often highlight genes with key biological roles (Clément et al., 1998Clément K. Vaisse C. Lahlou N. Cabrol S. Pelloux V. Cassuto D. Gourmelen M. Dina C. Chambaz J.

Hegele R.A. Genetics of lipid and lipoprotein disorders and traits.Curr. Genet. Med. Rep. 2016; 4: 130-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), rare variants are generally not major contributors to the overall phenotypic variance.6.SNPs in active chromatin and protein-coding variants are both significantly enriched for contributing to complex traits. However, protein-coding variants are relatively rare in the genome and thus contribute only a small fraction of heritability. Instead, the heritability is generally dominated by noncoding variants, especially variants in gene regulatory regions (Pickrell, 2014Pickrell J.K.

There is strong enrichment of both cis- and trans-eQTLs among GWAS hits, albeit still a considerable gap in linking all hits to eQTLs (Ardlie et al., 2015Ardlie K.G. Deluca D.S. Segrè A.V.

Together, these points suggest an architecture in which some genes (and their regulatory networks) are functionally proximate to disease risk. These genes tend to produce the biggest signals in common- and rare-variant association studies, and they tend to be the most illuminating from the point of view of understanding disease etiology. However, they are responsible for only a small fraction of the genetic variance in disease risk. Instead, the bulk of the heritability is mediated through genes that have a wide variety of functions, many of which have no obvious functional connection to disease. Lastly, most of the GWAS hits are in noncoding, putatively regulatory regions of the genome, indicating that the primary links between genetic variation and complex disease are via gene regulation. We previously proposed the omnigenic model as a conceptual framework to explain the observations above (Figure 1) (Boyle et al., 2017aBoyle E.A. Li Y.I. Pritchard J.K. An Expanded View of Complex Traits: From Polygenic to Omnigenic.Cell. 2017; 169: 1177-1186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, Boyle et al., 2017bBoyle E. Li Y. Pritchard J. The Omnigenic Model: Response from the Authors.J Psychiatr Brain Sci. 2017; 2: S8Google Scholar). The omnigenic model partitions genes into core genes and peripheral genes. Core genes can affect disease risk directly, while peripheral genes can only affect risk indirectly through trans-regulatory effects on core genes. Two key proposals of the omnigenic model are (1) that most, if not all, genes expressed in trait-relevant cells have the potential to affect core-gene regulation and (2) that for typical traits, nearly all of the heritability is determined by variation near peripheral genes. Thus, while core genes are the key drivers of disease, it is the cumulative effects of many peripheral gene variants that determine polygenic risk. As defined in this paper, “omnigenic” has a more precise meaning than the term “polygenic.” Polygenic can be used to describe the involvement of anything from tens of loci to every variant in the genome and would include omnigenic as a special case, toward the high end of the polygenic spectrum. We also use the term “omnigenic model” to refer to our specific model of complex trait architecture in which heritability is mainly driven by peripheral genes that trans-regulate core genes. It is also worth distinguishing our model from Fisher’s classic infinitesimal model (Fisher, 1918Fisher R.A. The correlation between relatives on the supposition of Mendelian inheritance.Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. 1918; 52: 399-433Crossref Scopus (2537) Google Scholar, Barton et al., 2017Barton N.H. Etheridge A.M. Véber A. The infinitesimal model: Definition, derivation, and implications.Theor. Popul. Biol. 2017; 118: 50-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The infinitesimal model was originally developed in the pre-molecular era. While fundamentally important for understanding patterns of inheritance, it does not tell us how many causal variants to expect in practice nor about the molecular mechanisms linking genetic variation to phenotypes. We define a gene as a “core gene” if and only if the gene product (protein, or RNA for a noncoding gene) has a direct effect—not mediated through regulation of another gene—on cellular and organismal processes leading to a change in the expected value of a particular phenotype. This definition improves on our previous definition of core genes, which was less precise. All other genes expressed in relevant cell types are considered “peripheral genes” and can only affect the phenotype indirectly through regulatory effects on core genes. Here, we use the term “regulatory” to include diverse forms of regulation of core genes by other gene products within a cell: this includes regulation of mRNA or protein expression levels, and transcript usage; post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation; and protein localization. We exclude detection of extracellular signaling such as hormones or cytokines from this definition, such that signaling receptors can be core genes (see Discussion). These definitions imply that the phenotype of an individual is conditionally independent of the peripheral genes, given the expression levels and coding sequences of the core genes (Figure 2). Lastly, genes that are “unexpressed” in trait-relevant tissues are assumed not to contribute to heritability. While most peripheral genes make small contributions to heritability, some peripheral genes, such as transcription factors and protein regulators, play important roles because they regulate multiple core genes (Figure 1C). As discussed below, when a single peripheral gene coordinately regulates multiple downstream core genes with shared directions of effect, there is a potential for relatively large effect sizes at that peripheral gene. We refer to such genes as “peripheral master regulators.” In the Discussion, we provide examples to illustrate these definitions. In this article, we consider all of the parameter values—including SNP allele frequencies and effect sizes and the structure of regulatory networks—as fixed (though generally not known at the present time) and seek to understand how these drive the architecture of complex traits. However, it is important to note that these parameters are evolved properties of the biological system. In particular, natural selection acts most strongly against the largest-effect variants (Simons et al., 2018Simons Y.B. Bullaughey K. Hudson R.R. Sella G. A population genetic interpretation of GWAS findings for human quantitative traits.PLoS Biol. 2018; 16: e2002985Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This limits the potential contributions of the most constrained genes, and thus, the genes that are biologically most important for a given trait may contribute less to heritability than would be expected from their intrinsic importance (O’Connor et al., 2018O’Connor L.J. Schoech A.P. Hormozdiari F. Gazal S. Patterson N. Price A.L. Polygenicity of complex traits is explained by negative selection.bioRxiv. 2018; https://doi.org/10.1101/420497Crossref Google Scholar). For example, it has been argued that master regulators are under particularly strong selective constraint; hence, they may not show up well in association studies of common variants (Chen et al., 2017Chen H. Wu C.-I. He X. The genotype-phenotype relationships in the light of natural selection.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2017; 35: 525-542Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We plan to expand on these points in a future manuscript. To model the contribution of core and peripheral genes to complex trait heritability, we now propose a quantitative model that links phenotypic variation to the expression levels of core genes in a disease-relevant tissue:Yi=Y¯+∑j=1Mγj(xi,j−xj¯)︸Mcoregenes,γj≠0+∑j=M+1N0×(xi,j−xj¯)︸N−Mperipheralgenes,γj=0 +εYi.(1) Here Yi denotes the phenotype value in individual i, and Y¯ is the population mean phenotype. γj denotes the direct effect of a unit change in expression of core gene j on E(Yi), and xi,j is the expression of gene j in individual i (with population mean xj¯). There are M core genes out of N total expressed genes. The random error term εYi represents environmental and stochastic effects. It has mean 0 and is assumed to be independent of genotype and gene expression. A summary of notation and further modeling details appears in the STAR Methods. Importantly, this model assumes that each core gene affects the expected phenotype value as a linear function of its expression level (with slope γj). Although the expression levels of peripheral genes do not have direct effects on phenotype Y, peripheral genes can affect Y indirectly by modifying the expression of core genes as trans-QTLs. This model assumes the simplest possible relationship between expression levels of core genes and the phenotype: namely that the expression of each core gene is linearly related to the expected phenotype value and with no additional interaction terms. Though we do not consider it here, many traits are affected by distinct biological processes acting in different tissues. This would be easy to model by adding tissue-specific subscripts to the notation. Then, assuming no interaction terms between tissues, the GWAS effect size on SNP l is just the sum of tissue-specific effects. We also note that, although this model is described in terms of quantitative phenotypes, presence or absence of a disease can be modeled by assuming that disease risk is determined by an underlying quantitative liability scale. We next use this model to explore the relationship between cis- and trans-QTL effects and heritability.

https://openalex.org/W2943053066,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver is the most common liver disease worldwide. Here, we show that the mitochondrial protein mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) protects against liver disease. Reduced Mfn2 expression was detected in liver biopsies from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Moreover, reduced Mfn2 levels were detected in mouse models of steatosis or NASH, and its re-expression in a NASH mouse model ameliorated the disease. Liver-specific ablation of Mfn2 in mice provoked inflammation, triglyceride accumulation, fibrosis, and liver cancer. We demonstrate that Mfn2 binds phosphatidylserine (PS) and can specifically extract PS into membrane domains, favoring PS transfer to mitochondria and mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) synthesis. Consequently, hepatic Mfn2 deficiency reduces PS transfer and phospholipid synthesis, leading to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the development of a NASH-like phenotype and liver cancer. Ablation of Mfn2 in liver reveals that disruption of ER-mitochondrial PS transfer is a new mechanism involved in the development of liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W2943083682,"What specific features should visual neurons encode, given the infinity of real-world images and the limited number of neurons available to represent them? We investigated neuronal selectivity in monkey inferotemporal cortex via the vast hypothesis space of a generative deep neural network, avoiding assumptions about features or semantic categories. A genetic algorithm searched this space for stimuli that maximized neuronal firing. This led to the evolution of rich synthetic images of objects with complex combinations of shapes, colors, and textures, sometimes resembling animals or familiar people, other times revealing novel patterns that did not map to any clear semantic category. These results expand our conception of the dictionary of features encoded in the cortex, and the approach can potentially reveal the internal representations of any system whose input can be captured by a generative model."
https://openalex.org/W2942965435,"The precise control of CRISPR-Cas9 activity is required for a number of genome engineering technologies. Here, we report a generalizable platform that provided the first synthetic small-molecule inhibitors of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) that weigh <500 Da and are cell permeable, reversible, and stable under physiological conditions. We developed a suite of high-throughput assays for SpCas9 functions, including a primary screening assay for SpCas9 binding to the protospacer adjacent motif, and used these assays to screen a structurally diverse collection of natural-product-like small molecules to ultimately identify compounds that disrupt the SpCas9-DNA interaction. Using these synthetic anti-CRISPR small molecules, we demonstrated dose and temporal control of SpCas9 and catalytically impaired SpCas9 technologies, including transcription activation, and identified a pharmacophore for SpCas9 inhibition using structure-activity relationships. These studies establish a platform for rapidly identifying synthetic, miniature, cell-permeable, and reversible inhibitors against both SpCas9 and next-generation CRISPR-associated nucleases."
https://openalex.org/W2942076130,"Genome editing of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provides powerful opportunities for in vitro disease modeling, drug discovery, and personalized stem cell-based therapeutics. Currently, only small edits can be engineered with high frequency, while larger modifications suffer from low efficiency and a resultant need for selection markers. Here, we describe marker-free genome editing in hPSCs using Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) in combination with AAV6-mediated DNA repair template delivery. We report highly efficient and bi-allelic integration frequencies across multiple loci and hPSC lines, achieving mono-allelic editing frequencies of up to 94% at the HBB locus. Using this method, we show robust bi-allelic correction of homozygous sickle cell mutations in a patient-derived induced PSC (iPSC) line. Thus, this strategy shows significant utility for generating hPSCs with large gene integrations and/or single-nucleotide changes at high frequency and without the need for introducing selection genes, enhancing the applicability of hPSC editing for research and translational uses."
https://openalex.org/W2943570324,"Patterning in plants relies on oriented cell divisions and acquisition of specific cell identities. Plants regularly endure wounds caused by abiotic or biotic environmental stimuli and have developed extraordinary abilities to restore their tissues after injuries. Here, we provide insight into a mechanism of restorative patterning that repairs tissues after wounding. Laser-assisted elimination of different cells in Arabidopsis root combined with live-imaging tracking during vertical growth allowed analysis of the regeneration processes in vivo. Specifically, the cells adjacent to the inner side of the injury re-activated their stem cell transcriptional programs. They accelerated their progression through cell cycle, coordinately changed the cell division orientation, and ultimately acquired de novo the correct cell fates to replace missing cells. These observations highlight existence of unknown intercellular positional signaling and demonstrate the capability of specified cells to re-acquire stem cell programs as a crucial part of the plant-specific mechanism of wound healing."

Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD 2017) was used to observe the vision loss burden in terms of prevalence and Years Lived with Disability (YLDs). As of 2017, out of 207.7 million people in Pakistan, an estimated 1.12 million (95% Uncertainty Interval [UI] 1.07-1.19) were blind (Visual Acuity [VA] <3/60), 1.09 million [0.93-1.24] people had severe vision loss (3/60≤VA<6/60) and 6.79 million [6.00-7.74] people had moderate vision loss (6/60≤VA<6/18). Presbyopia was found to be the most common ocular condition that affected an estimated 12.64 million [11.94-13.41] people (crude prevalence 6.08% [5.75-6.45]; 61% female). In terms of age-standardized YLDs rate, Pakistan is ranked fourth among other South Asian countries and twenty-first among other 42 low-middle income countries (classified by World Bank), with 552.98 YLDs [392.98-752.95] per 100,000. Compared with 1990, all-age YLDs count of blindness and vision impairment increased by 55% in 2017, which is the tenth highest increase among major health loss causes (such as dietary iron deficiency, headache disorders, low back pain etc.) in Pakistan. Moreover, our statistics show an increase in vision loss burden by 2025 for which Pakistan needs to make more efforts to encounter the growing burden of eye diseases."

The role of microflora during hair loss remains to be understood. We therefore analyzed the microbiome of hair follicles from hair loss patients and the healthy. Hair follicles were extracted from occipital and vertex region of hair loss patients and healthy volunteers and further dissected into middle and lower compartments. The microbiome was then characterized by 16S rRNA sequencing. Distinct microbial population were found in the middle and lower compartment of hair follicles. Middle hair compartment was predominated by Burkholderia spp. and less diverse; while higher bacterial diversity was observed in the lower hair portion. Occipital and vertex hair follicles did not show significant differences. In hair loss patients, miniaturized vertex hair houses elevated Propionibacterium acnes in the middle and lower compartments while non-miniaturized hair of other regions were comparable to the healthy. Increased abundance of P. acnes in miniaturized hair follicles could be associated to elevated immune response gene expression in the hair follicle."

Our recent genomic studies in the mouse have revealed a complex kidney-specific enhancer module within the introns of adjacent methyltransferase-like 1 (Mettl1) and Mettl21b that mediate basal and PTH-induced expression of Cyp27b1 and FGF23- and 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated repression. Gross deletion of these segments in mice has severe effects on Cyp27b1 regulation and skeletal phenotype but does not affect Cyp27b1 expression in nonrenal target cells (NRTCs). Here, we report a bimodal activity in the Mettl1 intronic enhancer with components responsible for PTH-mediated Cyp27b1 induction and 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated repression and additional activities, including FGF23 repression, within the Mettl21b enhancers. Deletion of both submodules eliminated basal Cyp27b1 expression and regulation in the kidney, leading to systemic and skeletal phenotypes similar to those of Cyp27b1-null mice. However, basal expression and lipopolysaccharide-induced regulation of Cyp27b1 in NRTCs was unperturbed. Importantly, dietary normalization of calcium, phosphate, PTH, and FGF23 rescued the skeletal phenotype of this mutant mouse, creating an ideal in vivo model to study nonrenal 1,25(OH)2D3 production in health and disease. Finally, we confirmed a conserved chromatin landscape in human kidney that is similar to that in mouse. These findings define a finely balanced homeostatic mechanism involving PTH and FGF23 together with protection from 1,25(OH)2D3 toxicity that is responsible for both adaptive vitamin D metabolism and mineral regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2943589369,"Background We evaluated the ability of various grading scales including platelet-albumin-bilirubin (PALBI) and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grades to predict overall survival (OS) according to treatment modality in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods The cohort of 6,669 patients with HCC was selected randomly from the 2008–2012 national cohort of the Korean Central Cancer Registry. The OS of 6,507 of these patients was evaluated using the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class, Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, and ALBI and PALBI grades. Results The patient’s mean age was 59.7 years. The most patients were hepatitis B virus (63.4%) and CTP class A (71.8%). The median OS durations of PALBI grade1 (38.4%), grade2 (33.2%), and grade3 (28.4%) patients were 81, 30, and 5 months, respectively (P<0.001). The PALBI grade had a larger area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) than did the CTP class, MELD score, and ALBI grade (overall AUC: 0.675 vs. 0.633, 0.645, and 0.642, respectively; P < 0.001). Moreover, the PALBI and ALBI grades enabled sub-classification of CTP A patients (P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, the PALBI and ALBI grades were significant risk factors for OS (P < 0.05). According to treatment modality, the PALBI grade was predictive of OS in patients receiving transarterial chemoembolization or supportive care. The ALBI grade was predictive of OS in patients undergoing surgical resection or radiofrequency ablation. Conclusion The PALBI and ALBI grades are more reliable for accessing liver function and predicting OS in patients with HCC. Moreover, according to treatment modality, appropriate use of the ALBI and PALBI grades will enable accurate determination of the prognosis of patients with HCC."

Studies performed on isolated rat heart mitochondria also showed that OP2113 does not affect oxidative phosphorylation driven by complex I or complex II substrates. We assessed the effect of OP2113 on an infarct model of ex vivo rat heart in which mitochondrial ROS production is highly involved and showed that OP2113 protects heart tissue as well as the recovery of heart contractile activity. Conclusion / Significance This work represents the first demonstration of a drug authorized for use in humans that can prevent mitochondria from producing ROS/H2O2. OP2113 therefore appears to be a member of the new class of mitochondrial ROS blockers (S1QELs) and could protect mitochondrial function in numerous diseases in which ROS-induced mitochondrial dysfunction occurs. These applications include but are not limited to aging, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer's diseases, cardiac atrial fibrillation, and ischemia-reperfusion injury."

Using sucrose gradient sedimentation, native affinity purifications, in vitro binding assays, and SILAC-based quantitative proteomics, we found that Mam33 does not associate with the mature mitoribosome, but directly binds a subset of unassembled large subunit proteins. Based on these data, we propose that Mam33 binds specific mitoribosomal proteins to ensure proper assembly.

https://openalex.org/W2943098078,"The Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha: Psylloidea: Liviidae) is an important pest of citrus species worldwide because it transmits Candidatus Liberibacter spp. (Alphaproteobacteria), the causative agents of an incurable citrus disease known as huanglongbing or greening disease. Diaphorina citri possesses a vertically-transmitted intracellular symbiont, Candidatus Profftella armatura (Betaproteobacteria), which produces diaphorin, a polyketide that is significantly toxic to mammalian cells. Diaphorin is an analog of pederin, a defensive polyketide in the body fluid of Paederus rove beetles (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) that deters predators. In the present study, as a first step to assess the possibility that diaphorin is toxic to biological control agents, we assayed diaphorin activities against insects and fungi. The target cells and organisms were (a) the Sf9 cell line derived from the fall armyworm moth Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), (b) the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha: Aphidoidea: Aphididae), a phloem sap-sucking insect that is closely related to psyllids, (c) the Asian lady beetle Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), one of the major predators of D. citri, and (d) the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Ascomycota: Saccharomycetes) as a model of fungal pathogens. For a comparison, we also evaluated pederin activities. The results of our analyses revealed the following: (1) Diaphorin and pederin are significantly toxic to the tested insects and yeast; (2) Their toxicities vary widely among the target cells and organisms; (3) Diaphorin is generally less toxic than pederin; (4) The toxicities of diaphorin and pederin are considerably different in the Sf9 insect cell line and S. cerevisiae, but similar in A. pisum and H. axyridis; and (5) The amount of diaphorin contained in D. citri is toxic to all of the tested cells and organisms, suggesting that this polyketide is potentially harmful for biological control agents."

The multiple social inequalities, and therefore the constant insecurities for many about low income, poor living conditions, unemployment, and discrimination, generate chronic stress in this population. In the Baby Teeth Talk Study, an oral-health randomized controlled trial, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) was administered to 367 pregnant Aboriginal women at baseline. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the validity and reliability of the PSS-14 in an Aboriginal population. The study analysed: (a) model fit; (b) dimensionality; (c) local dependence; (d) differential item functioning; (e) threshold ordering and item fit; (f) targeting; (g) reliability; and (h) criterion validity. The dimensionality analysis indicated a two-factor structure, with negatively and positively worded items clustering together and 21.7% (95% Agresti-Coull C.I. [17.8%, 26.2%]) statistically significant t-tests between the persons’ estimates. After the creation of composite items, the revised Perceived Distress (χ2 (21) = 11.74, p = 0.946) and Perceived Coping (χ2 (28) = 17.63, p = 0.935) subscales fitted the Rasch model. Reliability was modest (PersonSeparationIndexdistress = 0.72; PersonSeparationIndexcoping = 0.76). The latent correlation between the Perceived Distress and Perceived Coping subscales was r = 0.14. It is hypothesized that the social inequalities experienced by the Aboriginal population are so pronounced that even Aboriginal pregnant women that perceived themselves as coping well with life challenges ended up endorsing items regarding high levels of stress. The present research showed that a revised PSS-14 is a culturally valid and modestly reliable psychological instrument to measure stress in a population of pregnant Aboriginal women in Australia."
https://openalex.org/W2943273635,"Viruses have different strategies for infecting their hosts. Fast and acute infections result in the development of severe symptoms and may cause the death of the plant. By contrast, in a persistent interaction, the virus can survive within its host for a long time, inducing only mild symptoms. In this study, we investigated the gene expression changes induced in CymRSV-, crTMV-, and TCV-infected Nicotiana benthamiana and in PVX- and TMV-U1-infected Solanum lycopersicum plants after the systemic spread of the virus by two different high-throughput methods: microarray hybridization or RNA sequencing. Using these techniques, we were able to clearly differentiate between acute and persistent infections. We validated the gene expression changes of selected genes by Northern blot hybridization or by qRT-PCR. We show that, in contrast to persistent infections, the drastic shut-off of housekeeping genes, downregulation of photosynthesis-related transcripts and induction of stress genes are specific outcomes with acute infections. We also show that these changes are not a consequence of host necrosis or the presence of a viral silencing suppressor. Thermal imaging data and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements correlated very well with the molecular changes. We believe that the molecular and physiological changes detected during acute infections mostly contribute to virus symptom development. The observed characteristic physiological changes associated with economically more dangerous acute infections could serve as a basis for the elaboration of remote monitoring systems suitable for detecting developing virus infections in crops. Moreover, as molecular and physiological changes are characteristics of different types of virus lifestyles, this knowledge can support risk assessments of recently described novel viruses."

It has been proposed that the excess lipolysis induced by GC in white adipose tissue plays a role in the development of dyslipidemia and fatty liver (15Arnaldi G. Scandali V.M. Trementino L.

This proposed mechanism is in agreement with previous observations showing that glucocorticoid-induced hepatic steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia are dependent on the presence of Angptl4 (angiopoietin-like 4), a GR primary target gene (17Koliwad S.K. Kuo T. Shipp L.E. Gray N.E. Backhed F. So A.Y. Farese Jr, R.V. Wang J.C.

Angptl4 encodes a secreted protein that can promote intracellular lipolysis in adipocytes (18Gray N.E. Lam L.N. Yang K. Zhou A.Y. Koliwad S. Wang J.C. Angiopoietin-like 4 (Angptl4) protein is a physiological mediator of intracellular lipolysis in murine adipocytes.J. Biol.

It has been shown that glucocorticoid-stimulated lipolysis in white adipose tissue is attenuated in mice lacking Angptl4 (Angptl4−/−) and purified ANGPTL4 protein directly induces lipolysis in mouse primary adipocytes (18Gray N.E.

Thus, it is conceivable that Angptl4 mediates glucocorticoid stimulation of lipolysis in white adipose tissue, which mobilizes fatty acids to the liver for TG synthesis and storage. Notably, Angptl4 has also been shown to be required for glucocorticoids to stimulate hepatic ceramide production, which activates protein phosphatase 2A and protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) to suppress insulin signaling in liver (19Chen T.C. Benjamin D.I. Kuo T. Lee R.A. Li M.L. Mar D.J. Costello D.E. Nomura D.K. Wang J.C. The glucocorticoid-Angptl4-ceramide axis induces insulin resistance through PP2A and PKCζ.Sci.

In this study, we examined this model and also identified the downstream effectors of ceramide-mediated signaling that mediate glucocorticoid response on hepatic TG homeostasis. Male WT and Angptl4−/− mice were treated with or without dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) for 7 days. At the end of the treatment, blood and liver were collected, and plasma and liver TG levels were measured. Dexamethasone treatment significantly elevated plasma and liver TG levels in WT mice (Fig. 1, A and B). These dexamethasone effects were suppressed in Angptl4−/− mice (Fig. 1, A and B). To examine whether dexamethasone treatment stimulates hepatic DNL and TG synthesis and the role of Angptl4 in these processes, we applied a stable isotope labeling technique. In the liver of PBS-treated WT mice, the absolute rate of DNL (mg palmitate synthesized over a 24-h labeling period) was 0.08 mg palmitate/day/mouse (Fig. 1C). Dexamethasone treatment for 7 days resulted in a 40-fold induction in the absolute DNL rate (3.2 mg palmitate/day; Fig. 1C). In contrast, the absolute rate of DNL in the liver of untreated Angptl4−/− mice was 0.09 mg palmitate/day (Fig. 1C). Dexamethasone treatment increased the rate of DNL 2.4-fold (to 0.22 mg palmitate/day; Fig. 1C). This induction was markedly lower than the dexamethasone response in liver of WT mice (p < 0.05). These results demonstrate that Angptl4 is involved chronic dexamethasone exposure–stimulated hepatic DNL. Dexamethasone treatment also resulted in 6-fold induction of the absolute rate of TG synthesis in the liver of WT mice (Fig. 1D). The absolute TG synthesis rate in liver of untreated Angptl4−/− mice was not statistically significantly different from untreated WT mice (Fig. 1D). Dex treatment did not elevate the absolute hepatic TG synthesis rate in Angptl4−/− mice (Fig. 1D). These results demonstrate that without Angptl4, the ability of Dex to augment TG synthesis in the liver was diminished. We analyzed the expression of genes involved in DNL and TG synthesis in the liver of WT and Angptl4−/− mice treated with or without dexamethasone. We found that the expression of genes encoding enzymes in DNL and TG synthesis, such as Fasn, Acaca, Acacb, Dgat2, Gpat1, and Lpin1, were increased by dexamethasone in WT mice liver (Fig. 2A). In Angptl4−/− mice, the ability of Dex to activate these genes was significantly reduced (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, dexamethasone treatment significantly reduced the expression of Srebp1c, a transcription factor that activates the transcription of many lipogenic genes (23Jeon T.I. Osborne T.F. SREBPs: metabolic integrators in physiology and metabolism.Trends Endocrinol Metab. 2012; 23 (22154484): 65-7210.1016/j.tem.2011.10.004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 24Wang Y.

In Angptl4−/− mice, the reduction of Srebp1c expression by dexamethasone was even more profound (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the expression of Chrebpβ, another transcription factor that augments lipogenic gene transcription (25Herman M.A. Peroni O.D. Villoria J. Schön M.R. Abumrad N.A. Blüher M. Klein S. Kahn B.B.

The expression of Chrebpα, a longer isoform of Chrebp (24Wang Y. Viscarra J. Kim S.J. Sul H.S. Transcriptional regulation of hepatic lipogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol.

However, the expression of Chrebpα was still reduced in Angptl4−/− mice liver (Fig. 2A). The fact that Srebp1c expression was reduced by chronic dexamethasone exposure raised a question regarding whether Srebp1c was activated to promote lipogenic and TG synthetic gene transcription. Interestingly, protein levels of the mature and the immature forms of Srebp1c in the whole cell extracts and the mature form of Srebp1c in the nuclear extracts isolated from control and dexamethasone-treated liver were similar (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrated that despite the reduction of Srebp1c mRNA by dexamethasone treatment, Srebp1c protein levels were not significantly decreased by dexamethasone treatment for the time period conducted in our experiments. We performed ChIP experiments to further examine the recruitment of Srebp1c to its binding site in the Fasn gene. We found that Srebp1c was recruited to the Fasn gene promoter without dexamethasone treatment, which likely provides the basal lipogenic action (Fig. 2C). Dexamethasone treatment further enhanced the Srebp1c recruitment to the Fasn gene promoter (Fig. 2C). These results are in agreement with the increased lipogenic rate in the livers of dexamethasone-treated mice. We previously showed that chronic dexamethasone exposure increased the accumulation of various species of ceramides in the liver of WT mice, and these dexamethasone effects were attenuated in the liver of Angptl4−/− mice (19Chen T.C. Benjamin D.I. Kuo T. Lee R.A. Li M.L. Mar D.J. Costello D.E. Nomura D.K. Wang J.C. The glucocorticoid-Angptl4-ceramide axis induces insulin resistance through PP2A and PKCζ.Sci. Signal. 2017; 10 (28743803)eaai7905 10.1126/scisignal.aai7905Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To examine whether ceramides are involved in dexamethasone-induced hepatic steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia, WT and Angptl4−/− mice were treated with dexamethasone, and with or without myriocin, an inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase 1 and 2 (Spt1/2), rate-controlling enzymes in the de novo ceramide synthesis pathway (27Miyake Y. Kozutsumi Y. Nakamura S. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Serine palmitoyltransferase is the primary target of a sphingosine-like immunosuppressant, ISP-1/myriocin.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211 (7794249): 396-40310.1006/bbrc.1995.1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Dexamethasone treatment was for 7 days, whereas myriocin was included in the final 4 days. Myriocin treatment decreased TG levels in both the plasma and the liver of dexamethasone-treated WT mice (Fig. 3, A and B). The TG levels in liver of dexamethasone-treated Angptl4−/− mice were significantly lower than those of dexamethasone-treated WT mice (Fig. 3, A and B). However, in dexamethasone-treated Angptl4−/− mice, myriocin did not further reduce the TG levels in plasma and liver (Fig. 3, A and B). These results suggest that increased ceramide production plays a key role in Angptl4 function in dexamethasone-induced TG accumulation in the plasma and the liver. We next monitored the effect of myriocin on the expression of lipogenic and TG synthetic genes in the liver of myriocin-treated WT and Angptl4−/− mice. We found that the expression of lipogenic genes, such as Fasn, Acaca, and Chrebpα, was reduced in the liver of myriocin-treated WT mice (Fig. 3C). The expression of Srebp1c, Cd36, and Chrebpβ, although not statistically significant, was also trending lower in myriocin-treated WT mice (Fig. 3C). Myriocin treatment did not affect the expression of these genes in Angptl4−/− mice. These results suggest that ceramide production is required for Angptl4’s role in the induction of lipogenic gene expression by chronic dexamethasone exposure. Interestingly, the expression of TG synthetic genes, such as Dgat2, Gpat1, and Lpin1, was not affected by myriocin treatment. We also found that myriocin increased the expression of Angptl4 in the liver but not epididymal white adipose tissue of WT mice treated with dexamethasone (Fig. 3D). To further confirm that the hepatic ceramide synthetic pathway is involved in triglyceride accumulation in the plasma and liver, we infected WT mice with adeno-associated virus (serotype 8) expressing scramble (control) small hairpin RNA (shRNA) or shRNA targeting Sptlc2, which encodes a rate-controlling enzyme of de novo ceramide synthesis. These mice were called AAV8-shSCR and AAV8-shSptlc2, respectively. We found that hepatic Sptlc2 expression was significantly lower in the liver of AAV8-shSptlc2 mice (Fig. 3E). Moreover, upon dexamethasone treatment, plasma and liver triglyceride levels were also significantly lower in AAV8-shSptlc2 mice than those of AAV8-shSCR mice (Fig. 3, F and G. These results are similar to those of the myriocin treatment experiments above (Fig. 3, A and B). PKCζ and PP2A are two known downstream effectors of ceramides. To examine whether PP2A is involved in glucose intolerance induced by glucocorticoids, WT mice were infected with adenovirus expressing scrambled shRNA or shRNA targeting Ppp2ca, which encodes the PP2A catalytic subunit. These mice were called Ad-shSCR and Ad-shPpp2ca, respectively. Western blots validated a significant reduction in the protein abundance of Ppp2ca by shRNA in mouse liver (Fig. 4A). However, we did not observe significant differences in plasma and liver TG levels between dexamethasone-treated Ad-shSCR and Ad-shPpp2ca mice (Fig. 4, B and C). To test the role of PKCζ in glucocorticoid-induced hepatic hypertriglyceridemia, WT and Angptl4−/− mice were injected with or without 2-acetyl-1,3-cyclopentanedione (ACPD), an inhibitor of atypical PKC, PKCζ, and PKCι (28Sajan M.P.

Western blots showed that ACPD treatment reduced the levels of phosphorylated PKCζ in liver (Fig. 5A), which indicates reduced PKCζ activity. We found that ACPD treatment reduced both plasma and liver TG accumulation in WT but not Angptl4−/− mice (Fig. 5, B and C). Based on these results, PKCζ but not PP2A is involved in chronic dexamethasone-induced hepatic steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia. To confirm whether PKCζ is downstream of ceramides, we performed Western blots to monitor phosphorylated PKCζ levels in the liver of dexamethasone-treated WT and Angptl4−/− mice that were treated with or without myriocin. We found that the relative ratio of phosphorylated PKCζ and total phosphorylated PKCζ was reduced in liver of WT mice (Fig. 5D). These results confirmed that ceramide production is involved in chronic dexamethasone treatment-induced PKCζ activity. We also found that Angptl4 expression was decreased by ACPD treatment in epididymal white adipose tissue but not liver of WT mice (Fig. 5E). PPARα has been previously implicated in the production of ceramides in various cell types (30Baranowski M.B.A. Zabielski P. Górski J.

Moreover, PPARα has been shown to be involved in glucocorticoid-induced hepatic gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance (33Bernal-Mizrachi C. Weng S. Feng C. Finck B.N. Knutsen R.H. Leone T.C. Coleman T. Mecham R.P. Kelly D.P. Semenkovich C.F. Dexamethasone induction of hypertension and diabetes is PPAR-α dependent in LDL receptor-null mice.Nat. Med. 2003; 9 (12847522): 1069-107510.1038/nm898Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We therefore examine whether PPARα is involved in dexamethasone treatment–induced plasma and liver triglyceride accumulation. WT mice treated with dexamethasone were treated with PBS or a PPARα antagonist GW-6471. GW-6471 treatment improved glucose tolerance in dexamethasone-treated mice (Fig. 6A). These results were in agreement with the previous observation that showed the improvement of dexamethasone-regulated glucose homeostasis in PPARα knockout mice (33Bernal-Mizrachi C. Weng S. Feng C. Finck B.N. Knutsen R.H. Leone T.C. Coleman T. Mecham R.P. Kelly D.P. Semenkovich C.F. Dexamethasone induction of hypertension and diabetes is PPAR-α dependent in LDL receptor-null mice.Nat. Med. 2003; 9 (12847522): 1069-107510.1038/nm898Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, GW-6471 treatment did not affect the accumulation of plasma and liver triglyceride levels in mice under dexamethasone treatment (Fig. 6, B and C). Dyslipidemia is one of the major adverse effects caused by chronic and/or excess glucocorticoid exposure. However, the mechanisms underlying this alteration are mostly unclear. Here we showed that dexamethasone treatment for 7 days elevated hepatic DNL and TG synthesis. Interestingly, previous studies show that glucocorticoid treatment alone on primary hepatocytes or hepatoma cells usually does not promote lipogenesis and/or TG synthesis (11Dolinsky V.W. Douglas D.N. Lehner R. Vance D.E. Regulation of the enzymes of hepatic microsomal triacylglycerol lipolysis and re-esterification by the glucocorticoid dexamethasone.Biochem.

This suggests that glucocorticoid effects on cell types other than hepatocytes are required for the enhancement of hepatic DNL and TG synthesis. Here we showed that Angptl4-dependent hepatic ceramide production is involved in chronic dexamethasone treatment-induced hepatic steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia (Fig. 7).

https://openalex.org/W2943686330,"Introduction Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is associated to dismal prognosis despite the use of palliative chemotherapy, partly due to the lack of knowledge of biological processes underlying disease progression. Exosomes have been identified as biomarkers sources in different cancer types. Aim of the study was to analyse the contents of circulating exosomes in patients with pancreatic cancer who received palliative chemotherapy. Patients and methods Patients were submitted to blood sample collection before chemotherapy (T0) and after 3 months (T3). We quantified by an ELISA-based technique specific proteins of cancer-derived exosomes (CD44,CD44v6,EpCAM,CD9,CD81,Tspan8,Integrin α6,Integrin β4,CD24,CXCR4). We correlated the baseline levels of these factors and changes between T3 and T0 and survival outcomes. Survival analyses were performed by Kaplan-Meier method. Correlation was assessed by log-rank test and level of statistical significance was set at 0.05. Multivariate analysis was performed by logistic regression analysis. Results Nineteen patients were enrolled. EpCAM T0 levels and increased EpCAM levels from T0 to T3 were those mostly associated with differences in survival. Patients having higher EpCAM had median progression free survival (PFS) of 3.18vs7.31 months (HR:2.82,95%CI:1.03–7.73,p = 0.01). Overall survival (OS) was shorter for patients having higher EpCAM (5.83vs16.45 months,HR:6.16,95%CI:1.93–19.58,p = 0.0001) and also response rates (RR) were worse (20%vs87%,p = 0.015). EpCAM increase during treatment was associated with better median PFS (2.88vs7.31 months,HR:0.24,95%CI:0.04–1.22,p = 0.003). OS was also better (8.75vs11.04 months, HR:0.77,95%CI:0.21–2.73,p = 0.66) and RR were 60%vs20% (p = 0.28). Among clinical factors that might determine changes on PFS and OS, only ECOG PS was associated to significantly worse PFS and OS (p = 0.0137and<0.001 respectively).Multivariate analysis confirmed EpCAM T0 levels and EpCAM T0/T3 changes as independent prognostic factors for PFS. Conclusions Pancreatic cancer patients exosomes express EpCAM, whose levels change during treatment. This represents a useful prognostic factor and also suggests that future treatment modalities who target EpCAM should be tested in pancreatic cancer patients selected by exosome EpCAM expression."

Fifty Holstein calves (38 ± 1.0 kg BW) were fed 5 L/d of milk plus starter feed until weaning, and corn silage and concentrate after weaning. The treatments were: control (CON), monensin (MON; 30 mg/kg of starter), probiotic E. faecium (PROB; 70 mg/kg of starter), essential oils (EO; 300 mg/kg of starter), or PROB + EO (EOPROB). Fecal score and dry matter intake (DMI) were measured daily, and animals were weighed every 15 d. A DNA extraction from feces was performed to identify the presence of microorganisms (E. coli, Hafnia, Shiguella, Lactobacillus spp, Enterococcus spp, and Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415) by PCR. Two 72-h digestibility trials were performed at days 20-28 and 50-56, by total fecal collection. The DMI before weaning was greater for EO (903.0 g/d) compared with MON (794.3 g/d) and EOPROB (783.1 g/d). The FCI decreased during pre-weaning for EO and MON. Average daily gain (ADG) and feed efficiency (FE) did not differ among treatments before weaning. After weaning, DMI and FCI did not differ among treatments. The EO had greater ADG (917.5 g/d) compared with CON (615.8 g/d) and PROB (592.6 g/d). The FE improved with EO (0.72 g/g) over CON (0.36 g/g), MON (0.49 g/g), and PROB (0.36 g/g). The PCR results showed absence of E. faecium NCIMB 10415 in animals fed PROB and CON. Animals fed PROB had greater intake of CP and NDF than animals fed EOPROB. The EO can be added to the dairy calf ration to improve fecal score and increase DMI. The pre-weaning FCI decrease with MON and increase with PROB."
https://openalex.org/W2943233478,"Atlantoaxial instability (AAI)/subluxation commonly occurs in small breed dogs. Ventral stabilization techniques using screws and/or pins and a plate or, more commonly, polymethylmethacrylate are considered to provide the most favorable outcome. However, the implantation of screws of sufficient sizes for long-term stability becomes challenging in toy breed dogs (e.g. <2 kg). We herein report the application of 3D printing technology to implant trajectory planning and implant designing for the surgical management of AAI in 18 dogs. The use of our patient-specific drill guide templates resulted in overall mean screw corridor deviations of less than 1 mm in the atlas and axis, which contributed to avoiding iatrogenic injury to the surrounding structures. The patient-specific titanium plate was effective for stabilizing the AA joint and provided clinical benefits to 83.3% of cases (15/18). Implant failure requiring revision surgery occurred in only one case, and the cause appeared to be related to the suboptimal screw-plate interface. Although further modifications are needed, our study demonstrated the potential of 3D printing technology to be effectively applied to spinal stabilization surgeries for small breed dogs, allowing for the accurate placement of screws and minimizing peri- and postoperative complications, particularly at anatomical locations at which screw corridors are narrow and technically demanding."

Here, we describe 2 distinct pools of IRE1α in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, one localized at the perinuclear ER and the other at the junctional SR. We discovered that, at the junctional SR, calsequestrin binds to the ER luminal domain of IRE1α, inhibiting its dimerization. This novel interaction of IRE1α with calsequestrin, one of the highly abundant Ca2+ handling proteins at the junctional SR, provides new insights into the regulation of stress coping responses in muscle cells.-Wang, Q., Groenendyk, J., Paskevicius, T., Qin, W., Kor, K.

The CFCEC was developed from adult tilapia from two farms in Colombia, and CFCEC samples were collected over two months. The pH varied from 6.25 to 6.35 throughout culturing, while anaerobic and aerobic cell counts stabilized at day 9, at 109 CFU mL-1 and were maintained to day 68. A variation in the CFCEC bacterial composition was observed over time. Cetobacterium was the most abundant in the first two days and coincided with a higher CFCEC supernatant antimicrobial effect against the fish pathogen Streptococcus agalactiae. Antimicrobial activity against S. agalactiae disappeared by day 3. Changes in bacterial composition continued to day 33 with Lactococcus spp. becoming the most abundant member of the community. In conclusion, the study of the CFCEC from intestinal tract of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) by 16S rRNA gene sequencing allowed identification of predominant bacterial genera in the continuous-flow competitive exclusion culture exhibiting antibacterial activity against the fish pathogen Streptococcus agalactiae."

Years-long experience with the specific repertoires of sounds of one or more musical styles is what characterizes professional musicians. Here we contrasted active experience with sounds, namely long-lasting motor practice, theoretical study and engaged listening to the acoustic features characterizing a musical style of choice in professional musicians with mainly passive experience of sounds in laypersons. We hypothesized that long-term active experience of sounds would influence the neural predictions of the stylistic features in professional musicians in a distinct way from the mainly passive experience of sounds in laypersons. Participants with different musical backgrounds were recruited: professional jazz and classical musicians, amateur musicians and non-musicians. They were presented with a musical multi-feature paradigm eliciting mismatch negativity (MMN), a prediction error signal to changes in six sound features for only 12 minutes of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. We observed a generally larger MMN amplitudes–indicative of stronger automatic neural signals to violated priors–in jazz musicians (but not in classical musicians) as compared to non-musicians and amateurs. The specific MMN enhancements were found for spectral features (timbre, pitch, slide) and sound intensity. In participants who were not musicians, the higher preference for jazz music was associated with reduced MMN to pitch slide (a feature common in jazz music style). Our results suggest that long-lasting, active experience of a musical style is associated with accurate neural priors for the sound features of the preferred style, in contrast to passive listening."
https://openalex.org/W2942694613,"Interest in public engagement with science activities has grown in recent decades, especially engagement through social media and among graduate students. Research on scientists’ views of engagement, particularly two-way engagement and engagement through social media, is sparse, particularly research examining graduate students’ views. We compare graduate students and faculty in biological and physical sciences at a land-grant, research-intensive university in their views on engagement. We find that both groups overwhelmingly believe that public input in decision-making around science issues is important, and hold largely pro-engagement attitudes. Graduate students, however, have somewhat more optimistic views of engagement through social media and on the appropriateness of discussing science controversy on social media. We discuss implications for graduate education and future engagement."
https://openalex.org/W2943069493,"Exercise has long been known to be beneficial to human health. Studies aimed at understanding the effects of exercise specifically focus on predetermined exercise intensities defined by measuring the aerobic capacity of each individual. Many disease models involving animal training often establish aerobic capacity by using the maximal lactate steady state (MLSS), a widely used method in humans that has frequently been used in rodent studies. The MLSS is defined as the highest exercise intensity at which blood lactate concentration remains constant and is roughly equivalent to 70-80% of maximal aerobic capacity. Due to our up-coming experiments investigating the effect of different exercise intensities in specific strains of tumor-bearing mice, the aim of the present study was to determine the MLSS in athymic nude (NCr nu/nu and NMRI), CDF1, and C3H mice by treadmill running at increasing speeds. However, despite thorough exercise acclimation and the use of different exercise protocols and aversive stimuli, less than half of the experiments across strains pointed towards an established MLSS. Moreover, gently prodding the mice during low to moderate intensity running caused a 30-121% (p<0.05) increase in blood lactate concentration compared to running without stimulation, further questioning the use of lactate as a measure of exercise intensity. Overall, MLSS is difficult to determine and large variations of blood lactate levels were observed depending on the exercise protocol, mice handling strategy and strain. This should be considered when planning experiments in mice using forced exercise protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2943456474,"Life expectancy increased in industrialized countries, but inequalities in health and mortality by socioeconomic position (SEP) still persist. Several studies have documented educational inequalities, yet the association between health and employment status remains unclear. However, this is an important issue considering the instability of the labour market and the fact that unemployment now also touches 'non-traditional groups' (e.g. the high-educated). This study will 1) probe into the association between unemployment and cause-specific mortality; 2) look into the possible protective effect of sociodemographic variables; 3) assess the association between unemployment, SEP, gender and cause-specific mortality.Individually linked data of the Belgian census (2001) and Register data on emigration and cause-specific mortality during 2001-2011 are used. The study population contains the Belgian population eligible for employment at census, based on age (25-59 years) and being in good health. Both absolute and relative measures of all-cause and cause-specific mortality by employment status have been calculated, stratified by gender and adjusted for sociodemographic and socioeconomic indicators.Unemployed men and women were at a higher risk for all-cause and cause-specific mortality compared with their employed counterparts. The excess mortality among unemployed Belgians was particularly high for endocrine and digestive diseases, mental disorders, and falls, and more pronounced among men than among women. Other indicators of SEP did only slightly decrease the mortality disadvantage of being unemployed.The findings stress the need for actions to ameliorate the health status of unemployed people, especially for the most vulnerable groups in society."
https://openalex.org/W2942522555,"In recent years, safety issues surrounding robots have increased in importance, as more robots are in close contact with humans, both in industrial fields and elsewhere. Safety standards for industrial robots operating in specific spaces have been established, but no such standards have been specified for collaborative and service robots. To establish safety standards for such robots, we assessed pressure pain thresholds for collisions between humans and robots, under the assumption that the pain threshold is lower than the mild injury threshold. The pressure pain threshold for collision with a robot was measured in 90 male Korean adults using a homemade collision system. The pain thresholds were measured three times at 15 sites, including the forehead. The highest threshold was 196.1 ± 85.8 N/cm2 at the back of the hand, and the lowest was 65.1 ± 22.6 N/cm2 at an arm nerve. Moderate thresholds, i.e., 100-120 N/cm2, were noted on the forehead, neck muscle, ball of the thumb, and shin. The thresholds of participants < 30 years of age were lower, by 3-33%, than those of participants aged > 30 years. Thresholds differed by body mass index only at certain sites, including the shoulder joint, neck, and back of the hand. The pressure pain threshold depended on individual characteristics, body site, and age. The threshold relevant to potential human-robot collisions was determined to be between 65.1 ± 22.6 and 196.1 ± 85.8 N/cm2."

It has also been demonstrated that regional cooling of the heart can prolong the APD and promote the termination of ventricular tachycardia. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the effect of hypothermia in suppressing cardiac arrhythmias using numerical modeling. For this purpose, we developed a mathematical model that couples Pennes’ bioheat equation and the bidomain model to simulate the effect of heat on the cardiac action potential. The simplification of the proposed heat–bidomain model to the heat–monodomain model is provided. A suitable numerical scheme for this coupling, based on a time adaptive mesh finite element method, is also presented. First, we performed two-dimensional numerical simulations to study the effect of heat on a regular electrophysiological wave, with the comparison of the calculated and experimental values of Q10. Then, we demonstrated the effect of global hypothermia in suppressing single and multiple spiral waves."
https://openalex.org/W2943356285,"X-linked juvenile retinoschisis (XLRS) is a hereditary retinal dystrophy, caused by mutations in the RS1 gene which encodes the secreted protein retinoschisin. In recent years, several molecules have been proposed to interact with retinoschisin, including the retinal Na/K-ATPase, L-voltage gated Ca2+ channels, and specific sugars. We recently showed that the retinal Na/K-ATPase consisting of subunits ATP1A3 and ATP1B2 is essential for anchoring retinoschisin to plasma membranes and identified the glycosylated ATP1B2 subunit as the direct interaction partner for retinoschisin. We now aimed to precisely map the retinoschisin binding domain(s) in ATP1B2. In general, retinoschisin binding was not affected after selective elimination of individual glycosylation sites via site-directed mutagenesis as well as after full enzymatic deglycosylation of ATP1B2. Applying the interface prediction tool PresCont, two putative protein-protein interaction patches (""patch I"" and ""patch II"") consisting each of four hydrophobic amino acid stretches on the ATP1B2 surface were identified. These were consecutively altered by site-directed mutagenesis. Functional assays with the ATP1B2 patch mutants identified patch II and, specifically, the associated amino acid at position 240 (harboring a threonine in ATP1B2) as crucial for retinoschisin binding to ATP1B2. These and previous results led us to suggest an induced-fit binding mechanism for the interaction between retinoschisin and the Na/K-ATPase, which is dependent on threonine 240 in ATP1B2 allowing the accommodation of hyperflexible retinoschisin spikes by the associated protein-protein interaction patch on ATP1B2."

https://openalex.org/W2943117461,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) is commonly associated with a range of neurodegenerative diseases, and targeting UPR components has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy. The UPR surveys protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum. However, many of the misfolded proteins that accumulate in neurodegeneration are localized so that they do not directly cause endoplasmic reticulum triggers that activate this pathway. Here, using a transgenic mouse model and primary cell cultures along with quantitative PCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry, we tested whether the UPR is induced in in vivo and in vitro murine models of tauopathy that are based on expression of mutant tauP301L. We found no evidence for the UPR in the rTg4510 mouse model, in which mutant tau is transgenically expressed under the control of tetracycline-controlled transactivator protein. This observation was supported by results from acute experiments in which neuronal cultures expressed mutant tau and accumulated misfolded cytoplasmic tau aggregates but exhibited no UPR activation. These results suggest that the UPR is not induced as a response to tau misfolding and aggregation despite clear evidence for progressive cellular dysfunction and degeneration. We propose that caution is needed when evaluating the implied significance of the UPR as a critical determinant across major neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2942692357,"Objective To investigate the correlation between dyspeptic symptoms and gastric motility parameters measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using volumetry and motility indices in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Materials and methods In this IRB-approved study, MRI datasets obtained from August 2014 to May 2016 in 38 PD patients were retrospectively analyzed. Patients underwent a 120-minute-long MRI study using a liquid test meal and 8 sets of scans. Gastric content volume (GCV) and total volume (TGV), gastric half emptying time (T1/2), motility index (GMI), accommodation (GA), and emptying (GE) values were acquired. These measurements were compared between patients according to the presence of gastric symptoms: early satiety (n = 25), epigastric pain (n = 13), and dyspepsia (n = 28). Results Patients with early satiety showed significantly decreased GE of GCV and TGV (p < 0.001 and p = 0.017). Dyspeptic patients had significantly decreased GE of GCV and GMI (p = 0.001 and p = 0.029). GE of GCV at 90 and 120 minutes were significantly lower in patients with early satiety (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002). GE of GCV and GMI at 90 minutes were significantly decreased in patients with dyspepsia (p = 0.004 and p = 0.002). T1/2 of GCV was prolonged in patients with early satiety, epigastric pain, and dyspepsia (p = 0.004, p = 0.041, and p = 0.023). T1/2 of TGV also delayed in patients with early satiety (p = 0.023). GMI at 90 minutes was significantly correlated with dyspepsia on multivariable analysis (p = 0.028). Conclusions Gastric motility can be quantitatively assessed by MRI, showing decreased GMI, delayed GE, and prolonged T1/2 in PD patients with early satiety or dyspepsia."
https://openalex.org/W2943203395,"The loss of Neanderthal groups across Western and Central Europe during Oxygen Isotope Stage (OIS) 3 has held the attention of archaeologists for decades. The role that climatic change, genetic interbreeding, and interspecies competition played in the extinction of Neanderthal groups is still debated. Hohle Fels is one of several important Middle and Upper Paleolithic sites from the Ach Valley in southwestern Germany which documents the presence of Neanderthals and modern humans in the region. Chronological and stratigraphic records indicate that these two groups occupied the site with little to no overlap or interaction. This provides the opportunity to examine the behavioural variability of Swabian Neanderthal populations without the complication of cross-cultural influence. In this study we contribute a terrestrial paleoenvironmental record derived from the small mammal material from Hohle Fels Cave to the ever-growing archaeological record of this period. By reconstructing the climate and landscape of the Ach Valley during this time we can identify the effect that the OIS 3 environment had on the presence of Neanderthals in the region. Based on indicator taxa and the habitat weighing method, the small mammal record, which includes rodents, insectivores, and bats, from Hohle Fels shows that the earliest Neanderthal occupation took place on a landscape characterized by substantial woodland and forest, rivers and ponds, as well as moist meadows and grasslands. A gradual increase in cold tundra and arctic environments is clear towards the end of the Middle Paleolithic, extending to the end of the early Aurignacian which may correlate with the onset of the Heinrich 4 event (~42,000 kya). Our taphonomic analysis indicates the material was accumulated primarily by opportunistic predators such as the great grey owl, snowy owl, and European eagle owl, and therefore reflects the diversity of landscapes present around the site in the past. Importantly, at the time Neanderthals abandoned the Ach Valley we find no indication for dramatic climatic deterioration. Rather, we find evidence of a gradual cooling of the Swabian landscape which may have pushed Neanderthal groups out of the Ach Valley prior to the arrival of modern human Aurignacian groups."
https://openalex.org/W2942595320,"Background The present study was aimed at validating the Malay-language version of the Self-Efficacy for Exercise Scale (SEE-M) using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Methods Data were collected from undergraduate students at all campuses of the Universiti Sains Malaysia. A total of 1,605 students completed the SEE-M (female: 71.5%, male: 28.5%), with the mean age of 20.3 years (SD = 1.5). Perceived self-efficacy was assessed with the 18-item SEE-M. Standard forward–backward translation was performed to translate the English version of the Efficacy for Exercise Scale (SEE) into the Malay version (SEE-M). Results The 2 initial measurement models tested (1-factor and 3-factor models) did not result in a good fit to the data. Subsequent investigation of the CFA results recommended some modifications, including adding correlations between the item residuals within the same latent variable. These modifications resulted in good fit indices for the 1-factor model (RMSEA = .059, CFI = .939, TLI = .922, SRMR = .049) and the 3-factor model (RMSEA = .066, CFI = .924, TLI = .903, SRMR = .051). The final measurement models comprised all 18 SEE-M items, which had significant factor loadings of more than .40. The test-retest results indicated that the SEE-M was stable, with an intra-class correlation of .99. The composite reliability was .886 for the 1-factor model and .670–.854 for the 3-factor model. Conclusions The translated version of the SEE-M was valid and reliable for assessing the level of self-efficacy for exercise among university students in Malaysia. Perspective This study examining the psychometric properties of the SEE scale based on CFA was the first to assess 2 proposed models (1-factor and 3-factor models) simultaneously and to translate the original, English-language SEE into Malay."

We evaluated the inter-session reliability of IPF in two 90:20 test protocols (hands on the wall (HW); and hands on chest (HC)) both performed on two occasions, 7 days apart. We then assessed 90:20 (HC) and 90:90 IPF immediately before (PRE) and after (POST) after a simulated soccer match protocol (BEAST90mod) and 48 (+48 h) and 72 hours (+72 h) later.Part one: the 90:20 showed moderate to high overall reliability (CV's of 7.3% to 11.0%) across test positions and limbs. CV's were lower in the HW than HC in the dominant (7.3% vs 11.0%) but the opposite happened in the non-dominant limb where CV's were higher in the HW than HC (9.7% vs 7.3%). Based on these results, the HC position was used in part two of the study. Part two: 90:20 and 90:90 IPF was significantly lower POST compared to PRE BEAST90mod across all testing positions (p<0.001). IPF was significantly lower at +48 h compared to PRE in the 90:20 in both limbs (Dominant: p<0.01,Non-dominant: p≤0.05), but not in the 90:90. At +72 h, IPF was not significantly different from PRE in either test.Simple to implement posterior IPF tests can help to define recovery from competition and training load in football and, potentially, in other multiple sprint athletes. Testing posterior chain IPF in a more knee extended 90:20 position may provide greater sensitivity to fatigue at 48 h post simulated competition than testing in the 90:90 position, but also may require greater degree of familiarization due to more functional testing position."

Here, we report the structural characteristics of four molecules that exhibited similar levels of inhibitory activity against OfChtII, a group II chitinase from the agricultural pest Asian corn borer Ostrinia furnacalis. These inhibitors were chitooctaose ((GlcN)8), dipyrido-pyrimidine derivative (DP), piperidine-thienopyridine derivative (PT), and naphthalimide derivative (NI). The crystal structures of the OfChtII catalytic domain complexed with each of the four inhibitors at 1.4–2.0 Å resolutions suggested they all exhibit similar binding modes within the substrate-binding cleft; specifically, two hydrophobic groups of the inhibitor interact with +1/+2 tryptophan and a −1 hydrophobic pocket. The structure of the (GlcN)8 complex surprisingly revealed that the oligosaccharide chain of the inhibitor is orientated in the opposite direction to that previously observed in complexes with other chitinases.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether combination of a statin and an ARB exerts synergistic anti-atherosclerotic effects, and to elucidate the mechanisms of combined effects.Atherosclerotic plaques were developed in arteries of 23 rabbits using a high-cholesterol diet (HCD) and intra-arterial balloon inflation. Rabbits received one of five different treatment strategies for 4 weeks: positive control [n = 5, HCD]; negative control [n = 3, regular chow diet]; statin [n = 5, HCD and rosuvastatin 10 mg]; ARB [n = 5, HCD and olmesartan 20 mg]; and combination [n = 5, HCD and statin+ARB].Histological analysis demonstrated that development of atherosclerotic plaques was inhibited more in combination group than in statin group (P = 0.001). Although macrophage infiltration identified by RAM11 staining was not significantly different between combination and individual treatment groups (31.76±4.84% [combination] vs. 38.11±6.53% [statin; P = 0.35] or 35.14±2.87% [ARB; P = 0.62]), the relative proportion of pro-inflammatory M1-macrophages was significantly lower in combination group than in ARB group (3.20±0.47% vs. 5.20±0.78%, P = 0.02). Furthermore, M2-macrophage polarization was higher in combination group than in statin group (17.70±3.04% vs. 7.86±0.68%, P = 0.001).Combination treatment with a statin and an ARB produced synergistic protective effects for atherosclerosis initiation and progression, which may be attributed to modulation of macrophage characteristics in the early period of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2942801789,"Sex-biased infections are a recurrent observation in vertebrates. In many species, males are more parasitized than females. Two potentially complementary mechanisms are often suggested to explain this pattern: sexual differences in susceptibility mainly caused by the effect of sex hormones on immunity and differential exposure to parasites. Exposure is mostly a consequence of host behavioural traits, but vector-borne parasitic infections involve another degree of complexity due to the active role of vectors in transmission. Blood-sucking insects may make choices based on cues produced by hosts. Regarding malaria, several studies highlighted a male-biased infection by Plasmodium sp in great tits (Parus major). We hypothesize that the mosquito vector, Culex pipiens, might at least partially cause this bias by being more attracted to male birds. Intrinsic variation associated to bird sex would explain a preference of mosquitoes for males. To test this hypothesis, we provide uninfected mosquitoes with a choice between uninfected male and female nestlings. Mosquito choice is assessed by sex typing of the ingested blood. We did not observe any preference for a given sex. This result does not support our prediction of a preference of mosquitoes for male great tits during the nestling period. In conclusion, mosquitoes do not seem to have an intrinsic preference for male nestlings. However, sexually divergent traits (e.g. behaviour, odour, metabolic rate) present in adults may play a role in the attraction of mosquitoes and should be investigated."

In consideration of the limitations of current therapeutic options for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, there is an urgent need to develop safer alternatives. Anacardic acid, a natural phenolic acid compound extracted from cashew nut shell, possesses potent antitumor and anti-inflammatory effects and inhibits NF-κB signaling. However, its effect on osteoclasts remains unknown. This study reports the first evidence for the antiosteoclastogenic and antiresorptive effects of anacardic acid on bone marrow-derived macrophage-derived osteoclasts. Mechanistically, anacardic acid disrupts the phosphorylation of TGF-β activated kinase 1 and subsequently suppresses multiple receptor activator of NF-κB ligand-induced signaling cascades, ultimately inhibiting the induction and activation of the crucial osteoclast transcriptional factor nuclear factor of activated T-cell cytoplasmic 1. Consistent with cellular results in vitro, anacardic acid treatment improves bone density in the murine model of ovariectomy-induced bone loss.

Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study among type 2 diabetic patients who had been receiving treatment at government hospitals of Harari region, Ethiopia from 2013 to 2017. We extracted data from patients’ medical records. We estimated incidence rate and compared survival curves between different exposure groups using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test. Weibull regression model was fitted to the data to identify the predictor variables. Variables with p-value <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results Overall, 14.5% (95%CI: 11.7–17.9) of the study population developed acute kidney injury, with median survival time of 57 months. The significant predictors were physical activity [Adjusted Time Ratio (ATR):95%CI; 0.6 (0.49–0.75)], congestive heart failure [ATR:95%CI; 0.84 (0.71–0.99)], chronic kidney disease [ATR:95%CI; 0.77(0.65–0.91)], hypertension [ATR:95%CI; 0.78(0.65–0.91)], obesity [ATR:95%CI; 0.84(0.74–0.96)], diabetic nephropathy [ATR:95%CI; 0.80(0.65–0.98)], diuretics & beta blockers [ATR:95%CI; 0.85(0.74–0.97)], and delay of follow-up [ATR:95%CI; 0.97(0.96–0.98)]. Conclusions Incidence of acute kidney injury was high in our study area. Hence, identification and controlling of comorbidities along with regular monitoring of kidney function are needed to prevent or delay the risk of acute kidney injury in type 2 diabetic patients."

Serum ucOC and OC concentrations remained significant factors even after adjusting for gender, HbA1c, body weight-adjusted total daily dose of insulin and duration of diabetes (β = -0.260, P = 0.027; β = -0.254, P = 0.031, respectively). However, serum ucOC and OC concentrations were not correlated with serum adiponectin or free-testosterone concentrations, muscle strength or dose of exogenous insulin. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the inverse correlation between serum ucOC or OC concentrations and body fat in patients with type 1 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2942738987,"Background With the advance of medical care, chronic non-communicable diseases, like chronic kidney disease (CKD), have become the predominant diseases around the world. With heavy society and economy burden, we shall make full use of chronic disease management, including precision therapies. And the prerequisite for implementing precision medicine is to fully understand the characteristics of patients. Being the basis of the Knowledge-Attitude-Practice Model, patient’s awareness is essential to conduct individualized treatments. However, there have been no validated questionnaires specific to the awareness of patients with CKD. Therefore, this study aims to develop and validate an awareness questionnaire for patients with CKD. Methods From March 2013 to September 2014, a cross-sectional study was conducted at Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine. Age 18 or above were enrolled in the study. After signing the informed consent, they received a self-developed questionnaire to evaluate their CKD-related awareness. Then we collected their demographic data for further analyses. We also conducted item analyses/ validity and reliability analysis to filter out improper items and to retain the eligible ones. Results We totally distributed 110 copies of the questionnaires and 100 of them were returned. After item analyses, 2 items were excluded because of Cronbach’s Alpha analysis. In total, 18 items were retained, comprising the final set of the questionnaire. For validity analysis, 4 components could explain the cumulative 73.966% extraction sums of the squared loadings; for reliability analysis, the Guttman Split-Half coefficient was 0.918. Conclusions This awareness questionnaire has favorable validity and reliability. It is a sound method for evaluating and measuring levels of disease-related awareness in CKD patients."

https://openalex.org/W2943447960,"Intentional drug overdose is the most common method of self-harm. As psychiatric disorders are very common in self-harm patients, the medication used to treat these disorders can become the means for the self-harm act. The present study aimed at investigating an association between the use of prescribed medication (analgesics and antipyretics, anti-epileptics, antipsychotics, antidepressants and psychostimulants) as a method of self-harm and prescription rates of this medication in Flanders. We investigated the possible effect of gender, alcohol use during the self-harm act and a history of self-harm.Data from the multicenter study of self-harm in Flanders between 2008 and 2013 were used. The significance of differences in percentages was calculated by GEE and the strength by odds ratios (OR).There was an increase in the odds of using antidepressants (0.8%) and antipsychotics (2%) among females when the rate of prescription increases. Analgesics and antipyretics (39.3/1,000) and antidepressants (124.9/1,000) were the most commonly prescribed drugs among females. Antidepressants (63.9/1,000) and antipsychotics (26.5/1,000) were the most commonly prescribed drugs among males. Antidepressants and analgesics and antipyretics were the most frequently used medications for self-harm. Analgesics and antipyretics during the self-harm act were more common among first-timers, while repeaters more commonly overdosed using antipsychotics and antidepressants.These findings suggest that the availability of medication via prescriptions plays an important role in the choice of the medication ingested during the self-harm act. Precautions are necessary when prescribing medication, including restrictions on the number of prescriptions and the return of unused medication to pharmacies after cessation of treatment. These issues should be a focus of attention in the education and training of physicians and pharmacists."
https://openalex.org/W2943065198,"Aim Christchurch, New Zealand, experienced two major earthquakes on 4th September 2010 and 22nd February 2011. Previous studies have demonstrated that earthquakes are associated with sudden cardiac deaths. Whilst myocardial ischemia would contribute to this, ventricular arrhythmia triggered by stress has also been suggested. We aim to study the impact of the two earthquakes on ventricular arrhythmia events. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of all patients resident in the earthquake zone with implantable defibrillators. Ventricular arrhythmia requiring therapy and non-sustained events were recorded from the period of 30 days before thru 30 days after the two earthquakes. Weekly event rates were calculated and compared using log rank analysis. Results are expressed as mean (range), significance was determined at the <0.05 level. Results For the 211 patients who were exposed to the 2010 earthquake, there was no difference in the proportion of patients free of therapy, either Shock or ATP (0.943 before and 0.933 after the earthquake, p = 0.85, ns). Similarly, there was no significant increase in events requiring therapy in the 236 patients exposed to the 2011 earthquake (0.957 before and 0.961 after the earthquake, p = 0.80, ns). We identified one patient who required multiple therapy for ventricular tachycardia immediately following both earthquakes. Conclusion The two Christchurch earthquakes were not associated with an increase in the event rate of either sustained or non-sustained ventricular arrhythmias in our patients. We identified only a single patient who had arrhythmic storms immediately following the earthquakes."
https://openalex.org/W2942558159,"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) constitutes a major cause of diarrhea in young children and animals, particularly in poor regions of the world, as well the traveler's diarrhea in adult individuals. Type II heat-labile enterotoxin (LT-II) from ETEC can cause profuse watery diarrhea, posing a potential threat to public health and animal husbandry. In the present study, isothermal multiple-self-matching-initiated amplification (IMSA) was established to rapidly detect LT-II producing ETEC. The specificity and sensitivity were assessed, and clinical samples were tested. The established IMSA method had good specificity for the detection of LT-II gene with a limit of detection of 25 CFU/mL, i.e. 2 times higher than that of real-time PCR and other two isothermal amplifications (loop-mediated isothermal amplification, LAMP and cross-primer isothermal amplification, CPA). Meanwhile, in 103 clinical Escherichia coli strains isolated from diarrhea samples, 9 strains with LT-II+ gene were detected (8.73%), corroborating real-time PCR, LAMP and CPA data. Therefore, the IMSA technology applied for the detection of LT-II producing ETEC has a good application prospect for screening clinical samples in primary medical units or common laboratories."
https://openalex.org/W2943516062,"Myosin is famous as a component of muscle fibrils, but the majority of myosin family members act elsewhere with roles unrelated to muscle contraction. The biological functions of a relatively new family of these unconventional myosins, myosins 18A and 18B, are poorly understood. New research from Horsthemke et al. describes a new isoform (Myo18Aγ) that is essential for heart function and viability in mice. Their findings both support and contradict other work in the field and raise new questions about the roles of myosin 18 proteins in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2943686387,"Data on bonus freeze characteristics and their impact on complication rates and long-term clinical outcome are limited.Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) using a 28 mm 2nd-generation cryoballoon (CB) was performed in 169 patients (pts). The isolation temperatures, time to isolation and minimal temperatures of the cryoapplications were documented.The study included 92 pts who received one bonus freeze after PVI in group I and 77 pts who did not receive a bonus freeze in group II. After a mean follow-up time of 19.0±8.6 months in group I and 16.4±7.5 months in group II, 67 of 92 pts (72.8%) and 49 of 75 pts available to follow up (65.3%; p = 0.221) were free of atrial tachyarrhythmia, respectively. Phrenic nerve palsy occurred in 5.4% of the pts in group I (5/92 pts) and 1.3% of the pts in group II (1/77 pts; p = 0.22). Both the mean nadir temperatures of the bonus freezes and mean nadir temperatures of the isolation freezes differed significantly between the recurrent and non-recurrent pts in group I. The predilection sites of the reconduction for both groups were the inferior aspect of the inferior pulmonary veins.The impact of a bonus freeze on long-term clinical outcome was not significant for two reasons: 1) The necessity of a bonus freeze was low because the long-term clinical success rate without a bonus freeze was high; and 2) the majority of bonus freezes, especially at the predilection sites, such as the inferior PV, appeared to be ineffective."
