https://openalex.org/W2067152194,"The mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) protein is a serine-threonine kinase that regulates cell-cycle progression and growth by sensing changes in energy status. We demonstrated that mTOR signaling plays a role in the brain mechanisms that respond to nutrient availability, regulating energy balance. In the rat, mTOR signaling is controlled by energy status in specific regions of the hypothalamus and colocalizes with neuropeptide Y and proopiomelanocortin neurons in the arcuate nucleus. Central administration of leucine increases hypothalamic mTOR signaling and decreases food intake and body weight. The hormone leptin increases hypothalamic mTOR activity, and the inhibition of mTOR signaling blunts leptin's anorectic effect. Thus, mTOR is a cellular fuel sensor whose hypothalamic activity is directly tied to the regulation of energy intake."

From the interference fringes of a Michelson interferometer with and without the sample, we directly inferred the phase time delay. From the pulse-envelope shift, we determined the group time delay. In a spectral region, phase and group velocity are negative simultaneously. This means that both the carrier wave and the pulse envelope peak of the output pulse appear at the rear side of the sample before their input pulse counterparts have entered the front side of the sample."

Viruses are now finding a new expanded role as nanoplatforms with applications in materials science and medicine. Viruses form highly symmetrical monodisperse architectures and are ideal templates for engineering multifunctionality, including multivalent display of surface ligands and encapsulation of inorganic and organic materials. These developments assure that viruses will find applications as versatile nanoscale materials."

We show that ischemic-like conditions [O(2)/glucose deprivation (OGD)] open hemichannels, or half gap junctions, in neurons. Hemichannel opening was indicated by a large linear current and flux across the membrane of small fluorescent molecules. Single-channel openings of hemichannels (530 picosiemens) were observed in OGD. Both the current and dye flux were blocked by inhibitors of hemichannels. Therefore, hemichannel opening contributes to the profound ionic dysregulation during stroke and may be a ubiquitous component of ischemic neuronal death."

https://openalex.org/W2087249772,"The DKC1 gene encodes a pseudouridine synthase that modifies ribosomal RNA (rRNA). DKC1 is mutated in people with X-linked dyskeratosis congenita (X-DC), a disease characterized by bone marrow failure, skin abnormalities, and increased susceptibility to cancer. How alterations in ribosome modification might lead to cancer and other features of the disease remains unknown. Using an unbiased proteomics strategy, we discovered a specific defect in IRES (internal ribosome entry site)-dependent translation in Dkc1(m) mice and in cells from X-DC patients. This defect results in impaired translation of messenger RNAs containing IRES elements, including those encoding the tumor suppressor p27(Kip1) and the antiapoptotic factors Bcl-xL and XIAP (X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein). Moreover, Dkc1(m) ribosomes were unable to direct translation from IRES elements present in viral messenger RNAs. These findings reveal a potential mechanism by which defective ribosome activity leads to disease and cancer."

We used molecular self-assembly to create a synthetic, nanometer-scale, Sierpinski hexagonal gasket. This nondendritic, perfectly self-similar fractal macromolecule is composed of bis -terpyridine building blocks that are bound together by coordination to 36 Ru and 6 Fe ions to form a nearly planar array of increasingly larger hexagons around a hollow center."

https://openalex.org/W2003862004,"During plastic deformation of metals and alloys, dislocations arrange in ordered patterns. How and when these self-organization processes take place have remained elusive, because in situ observations have not been feasible. We present an x-ray diffraction method that provided data on the dynamics of individual, deeply embedded dislocation structures. During tensile deformation of pure copper, dislocation-free regions were identified. They showed an unexpected intermittent dynamics, for example, appearing and disappearing with proceeding deformation and even displaying transient splitting behavior. Insight into these processes is relevant for an understanding of the strength and work-hardening of deformed materials."
https://openalex.org/W2056274611,"Pseudomonas entomophila is an entomopathogenic bacterium that, upon ingestion, kills Drosophila melanogaster as well as insects from different orders. The complete sequence of the 5.9-Mb genome was determined and compared to the sequenced genomes of four Pseudomonas species. P. entomophila possesses most of the catabolic genes of the closely related strain P. putida KT2440, revealing its metabolically versatile properties and its soil lifestyle. Several features that probably contribute to its entomopathogenic properties were disclosed. Unexpectedly for an animal pathogen, P. entomophila is devoid of a type III secretion system and associated toxins but rather relies on a number of potential virulence factors such as insecticidal toxins, proteases, putative hemolysins, hydrogen cyanide and novel secondary metabolites to infect and kill insects. Genome-wide random mutagenesis revealed the major role of the two-component system GacS/GacA that regulates most of the potential virulence factors identified."
https://openalex.org/W2058255937,"The nature of pulse propagation through a material with a negative value of the group velocity has been mysterious, as simple models seem to predict that pulses will propagate “backward” through such a material. Using an erbium-doped optical fiber and measuring the time evolution of the pulse intensity at many points within the fiber, we demonstrate that the peak of the pulse does propagate backward inside the fiber, even though the energy flow is always in the forward direction."

We have managed to integrate kinesin motor proteins in closed submicron channels and to realize active electrical control of the direction of individual kinesin-propelled microtubule filaments at Y junctions. Using this technique, we demonstrate molecular sorting of differently labeled microtubules. We attribute the steering of microtubules to electric field-induced bending of the leading tip. From measurements of the orientation-dependent electrophoretic motion of individual, freely suspended microtubules, we estimate the net applied force on the tip to be in the picoNewton range and we infer an effective charge of 12 e- per tubulin dimer under physiological conditions."

The same mechanisms that were previously invoked to account for the vertical distribution of ecotypes at local scales accounted for the global (horizontal) patterns we observed. Basin-scale and seasonal variations in the structure and strength of vertical stratification provide a basis for understanding large-scale horizontal distribution in genetic and physiological traits of Prochlorococcus , and perhaps of marine microbial communities in general."
https://openalex.org/W1966376663,"Earth's magnetic field has decayed by about 5% per century since measurements began in 1840. Directional measurements predate those of intensity by more than 250 years, and we combined the global model of directions with paleomagnetic intensity measurements to estimate the fall in strength for this earlier period (1590 to 1840 A.D.). We found that magnetic field strength was nearly constant throughout this time, in contrast to the later period. Extrapolating to the core surface showed that the fall in strength originated in patches of reverse magnetic flux in the Southern Hemisphere. These patches were detectable by directional data alone; the pre-1840 model showed little or no evidence of them, supporting the conclusion of a steady dipole up to 1840."
https://openalex.org/W1978030865,"Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1), a cardioactive growth factor released from endothelial cells, has been shown to be indispensable for the normal function of the adult heart by binding to ErbB4 receptors on cardiomyocytes. In the present study, we have investigated to what extent ErbB2, the favored co-factor of ErbB4 for heterodimerization, participates in the cardiac effects of endothelium-derived NRG-1. In addition, in view of our previously described anti-adrenergic effects of NRG-1, we have studied which neurohormonal stimuli affect endothelial NRG-1 expression and release and how this may fit into a broader frame of cardiovascular physiology. Immunohistochemical staining of rat heart and aorta showed that NRG-1 expression was restricted to the endocardial endothelium and the cardiac microvascular endothelium (CMVE); by contrast, NRG-1 expression was absent in larger coronary arteries and veins and in aortic endothelium. In rat CMVE in culture, NRG-1 mRNA and protein expression was down-regulated by angiotensin II and phenylephrine and up-regulated by endothelin-1 and mechanical strain. CMVE-derived NRG-1 was shown to phosphorylate cardiomyocyte ErbB2, an event prevented by a 24-h preincubation of myocytes with monoclonal ErbB2 antibodies. Pretreating cardiomyocytes with these inhibitory anti-ErbB2 antibodies significantly attenuated CMVE-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and abolished the protective actions of CMVE against cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Accordingly, ErbB2 signaling participated in the paracrine survival and growth controlling effects of NRG-1 on cardiomyocytes in vitro, explaining the cardiotoxicity of ErbB2 antibodies in patients. Cardiac NRG-1 synthesis occurs in endothelial cells adjacent to cardiac myocytes and is sensitive to factors related to the regulation of blood pressure.

Binding of NRG-1 to its receptor induces the formation of homo- and heterodimers, which is crucial for signaling (2Holbro T. Hynes N.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 195-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Although NRG-1 does not bind directly to ErbB2, it is the favored co-receptor for heterodimerization (3Burden S. Yarden Y. Neuron. 1997; 18: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). This means that, in the adult heart, NRG-1 signaling can occur through ErbB2/ErbB4 heterodimers and/or ErbB4/ErbB4 homodimers. The importance of NRG/ErbB signaling in the adult heart was revealed by an unforeseen side effect of trastuzumab (Herceptin), a monoclonal antibody against ErbB2 used in the treatment of breast cancer. Unexpectedly, trastuzumab induced dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure in human patients when combined with a treatment of anthracycline (4Feldman A.M. Lorell B.H. Reis S.E. Circulation. 2000; 102: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 5Slamon D.J. Leyland-Jones B. Shak S. Fuchs H. Paton V. Bajamonde A. Fleming T. Eiermann W. Wolter J. Pegram M. Baselga J. Norton L. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (9405) Google Scholar). In addition, postnatal conditional mutation of cardiac ErbB2 leads to dilated cardiomyopathy in the mouse (6Ozcelik C. Erdmann B. Pilz B. Wettschureck N. Britsch S. Hubner N. Chien K.R. Birchmeier C. Garratt A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8880-8885Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Despite these observations, the specific role of ErbB2 in the cardioprotective actions of NRG-1 has remained controversial. Hence, the interpretation of the cardiotoxic effects of trastuzumab in patients has remained difficult. For example, Grazette et al. (7Grazette L.P. Boecker W. Matsui T. Semigran M. Force T.L. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2004; 44: 2231-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) indicate that inhibition of ErbB2 phosphorylation with a human inhibitory antibody that cross-reacts with the rat receptor homologue spontaneously activates the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Similarly, Rohrbach et al. report that targeting ErbB2 with antisense technology activates the same mitochondrial apoptotic cascade as anthracycline (8Rohrbach S. Muller-Werdan U. Werdan K. Koch S. Gellerich N.F. Holtz J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2005; 38: 485-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ozcelick et al. (6Ozcelik C. Erdmann B. Pilz B. Wettschureck N. Britsch S. Hubner N. Chien K.R. Birchmeier C. Garratt A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Miller T.A. Kuramochi Y. Frantz S. Kim Y.D. Marchionni M.A. Kelly R.A. Sawyer D.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In the latter study, the role of ErbB2 was studied with an ErbB2-stimulating antibody that failed to reveal a role of ErbB2 in the cell viability-modulating activities of NRG-1. NRG biology is, besides its complexity at the receptor level, further complicated by the release of multiple spliced variants of the NRG gene product. Cote et al. (10Cote G.M. Miller T.A. LeBrasseur N.K. Kuramochi Y. Sawyer D.B. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 311: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) demonstrate that cardiac endothelial cells release various NRG-1 isotypes. Studying the NRG-ErbB signaling axis and the specific role of ErbB2 with exogenously administrated recombinant NRG-1, as done in most studies, does therefore not mimic per se the molecular events induced by the “mixture” of ligands released by the endothelial organ. In the present study, we have investigated the role of ErbB2 in the hypertrophic and anti-apoptotic effects mediated by the cardiac endothelium through experiments with endothelium-cardiomyocyte co-cultures or endothelium-conditioned medium and with recombinant NRG-1 as a positive control. Prior to these studies, we verified and confirmed that the endothelium is the main source of NRG-1 in the heart and studied to what extent NRG-1 synthesis and release from the endothelium responds to neurohormonal and biomechanical stimuli. Reagents—Anti-ErbB2 antibody (Ab-9, clone B10) was purchased from Neomarkers. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture—Cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMVE) and rat aortic endothelial cells were isolated and cultured as previously described (11Nishida M. Carley W.W. Gerritsen M.E. Ellingsen O.

Confluent cell cultures were serum-starved for 24 h prior to the start of the experiments. Purity of the cell cultures has been demonstrated previously (12Hendrickx J. Doggen K. Weinberg E.O. Van Tongelen P. Fransen P. De Keulenaer G.W. Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 19: 198-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and confirmed at several points throughout the study. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were isolated from 1- to 2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured as previously described (13Yamamoto K. Dang Q.N. Kennedy S.P. Osathanondh R. Kelly R.A. Lee R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21840-21846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). AD293 cells were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and cultured following instructions of the vendor. Conditioned Medium and Co-Culture—To obtain conditioned medium, CMVE was grown to confluence on 75-cm2 culture flasks using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. At confluence, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal calf serum. The medium was collected 48 h later and stored at -20 °C until further use. For co-culture experiments, CMVE was grown to confluence on 6-well plate inserts (Biocoat®), serum-starved (0.1% fetal calf serum) for 24 h, and inserted into wells in which neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were grown and serum-starved for 24 h. Strain Experiments—For stretch experiments, cells were cultured on collagen-coated silicone membranes that allow controlled cyclic biaxial uniform strain (14Cheng G.C. Briggs W.H. Gerson D.S. Libby P. Grodzinsky A.J. Gray M.L. Lee R.T. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Rat Aortic Banding—Left ventricular hypertrophy was induced in adult Sprague-Dawley rats (224 g mean body weight) by a transverse aortic constriction (TAC) (15Condorelli G. Morisco C. Stassi G. Notte A. Farina F. Sgaramella G. de Rienzo A. Roncarati R. Trimarco B. Lembo G. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Briefly, rats were anesthetized with fentanyl (intramuscular, 0.05 mg/kg, Janssen-Cilag), diazepam (5 mg/kg, Roche Applied Science), and haloperidol (3 mg/kg, Janssen-Cilag) and subsequently intubated endotracheally and ventilated. A left lateral thoracotomy was performed exposing the heart and ascending aorta. A 5-0 black braided silk suture (Deknatel) ligature was tied around the ascending aorta between the innominate artery and the left carotid artery against an 18-gauge needle, and the needle was then removed. At least four rats in each group were killed at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after surgery. Age-matched control animals underwent a sham operation, including thoracotomy but without banding of the aorta. Hypertrophy was assessed from the heart weight/body weight ratio and echocardiographic parameters. Echocardiograms were performed on lightly anesthetized animals using a Vingmed System 5 equipped with a 10-MHz transducer before surgery and at the time of killing. Left ventricular anterior and posterior wall thickness and end-diastolic and end-systolic internal dimensions (end diastolic dimension (EDD), end systolic dimension (ESD)) were measured on three consecutive cycles and averaged by a single observer in a blinded fashion. Left ventricular end diastolic volume was obtained using the Teichholz method (16Teichholz L.E. Kreulen T. Herman M.V. Gorlin R. Am. J.

Fractional shortening was calculated as the % of fractional shortening, ((EDD - ESD)/EDD)) × 100 (17Coucelo J. Joaquim N. Coucelo J. J. Exp. Zool. 2000; 286: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Cells were harvested, and rat heart tissue (100 mg) was mixed in TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was isolated following instructions of the manufacturer. Real-time PCR was performed with the Taq-Man® one-step reverse transcription-PCR system (Applied Biosystems) in a 25-μl reaction volume containing 5 μl of total RNA (10-100 ng), 12.5 μl of one-step reverse transcription-PCR Master Mix, 0.5 μl of RNase inhibitor, 100-800 nm both primers and 400 nm probe. After initial incubation for 30 min at 48 °C and 10 min at 95 °C, 45 PCR cycles were performed that consisted of 15 s of denaturation at 95 °C and 60 s of annealing and extension at 60 °C on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system. TaqMan® probes were labeled with 6-carboxy-fluorescent reported dye and 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine quencher dye. Expression was normalized to GAPDH expression. Sequences for specific primers and probes were as follows: rat brain natriuretic peptide (BNP, GenBank™ accession number NM_031545) sense, 5′-TGGGCAGAAGATAGACCGGA-3′; antisense, 5′-ACAACCTCAGCCCGTCACAG-3′; and probe, 5′-CCAAGCGACTGACTGCGCCG-3′; rat GAPDH (GenBank™ accession number NM_017008) sense, 5′-GCCTCGTCTCATAGACAAGATGGT3′; antisense, 5′-GAAGGCAGCCCTGGTAACC-3′, and probe, 5′-CGTCCGATACGGCCAAATCCGTT-3′. To assess NRG-1 expression, the rat NRG Assay-on-demand (Applied Biosystems) was used consisting of premixed primers and TaqMan® probe. This assay recognizes the NRG-1 gene but does not discriminate between its isoforms. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed with anti-NRG-1α or -NRG-1β antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-PECAM (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule) antibodies (Serotec). Cryostat sections of rat hearts and aortas were obtained as previously described (18Fransen P. Hendrickx J. Brutsaert D.L. Sys S.U. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 52: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, following fixation with acetone for 10 min, cryosections were incubated with blocking solution (goat IgG, 0.2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) at room temperature. After 30 min, the sections were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, the secondary antibody was incubated for 2 h at 37°C and after three washes, the sections were mounted in Slowfade plus glycerol (Molecular Probes). Images were made on an Olympus fluorescence microscope with a Sensicam charge-coupled device camera and stored on a computer for later analysis with Photoshop software. Immunoprecipitation and Western Analysis—Immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting was performed (19Ungureanu-Longrois D. Balligand J.L. Simmons W.W. Okada I. Kobzik L. Lowenstein C.J.

Pathol. 2004; 202: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Heart tissue was mixed in the same lysis buffer (100 mg/ml) with a Polytron homogenizer (Pt 2100, Kinematica, Littau, Switzerland). Equal amounts of cell lysates were incubated with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight, in which, thereafter, protein A/G plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added. Proteins were separated on NuPAGE® BisTris gels (Invitrogen) and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Pierce). The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk with 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C and with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 2 h at room temperature. The signal was revealed with Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). NRG-1 in CMVE cell lysates (300 μg) was immunoprecipitated with an antibody targeting a common extracellular domain (Ab-1, clone 7D4; Neomarkers), on which, thereafter, Western analysis was performed with an antibody against the carboxyl terminus of NRG-1 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Equal volumes of CMVE culture medium were condensed using Centriplus YM-10 centrifugal filter units (Millipore) to 1.5 ml; proteins were further precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and immunoblotted with Ab-1. Activation of ErbB2 was determined in the cell lysates of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (500 μg) by immunoprecipitation with anti-ErbB2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies) and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (P-Tyr-100, Cell Signaling Technologies). A phosphatase inhibitor specific for tyrosine protein phosphatases was added to the lysis buffer (phosphatase inhibitor mixture 2, Sigma). Cardiomyocyte Surface Area—Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were cultured on culture slides in 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well and stimulated for 72 h by co-culture with CMVE or by medium conditioned by CMVE. After stimulation, the cells were incubated with BCECF-AM (2′7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(6Ozcelik C. Erdmann B. Pilz B. Wettschureck N. Britsch S. Hubner N. Chien K.R. Birchmeier C. Garratt A.N. Proc.

The cells were visualized using an Olympus fluorescence microscope with a Sensicam charge-coupled device camera, and the surface area was calculated with image analysis software (SigmaScan Pro 5). For each group, at least 80-100 cardiomyocytes were examined in eight randomly selected fields at 20× magnification in three independent experiments. During the analyses, the investigator was unaware of the treatment the cells had received. Cell Death Assays—Apoptosis was assessed using TUNEL staining with the in situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In separate experiments, Annexin V-Alexa-Fluor 488 conjugate (Molecular Probes) labeling was used. Stained cells were counted in six randomly selected fields in three independent experiments. The number of stained cells was normalized to the total number of cells counted by staining with DAPI (Roche Applied Science). The cells were counterstained with propidium iodide for differentiation from necrotic cells. During the analyses, the investigator was unaware of the treatment the cells had received. Statistics—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Mean values were compared with one-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. NRG-1 and BNP mRNA expression was quantified using the comparative threshold (CT) method with GAPDH as the endogenous control. Differences in CT for NRG or BNP and GAPDH were calculated for each treatment group and compared with one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Cells not exposed to any treatment were used as a reference for comparison. For NRG-1 expression during pressure overload in rat, a two-way analysis of variance was performed with treatment (TAC, sham) and time (2, 4, 8, 16 weeks) as between group factors, with post hoc Bonferroni testing for comparison of expression across the group. Endothelial NRG-1 Expression—Immunohistochemical staining of rat hearts and aortas was performed to study the endothelial expression of NRG-1 in vivo. Fig. 1A shows that a distinct staining of NRG-1β was detected in the endocardial endothelium and in the endothelium of the myocardial microvasculature (CMVE), but it was negative in aortic endothelium. Staining was also negative in the endothelium of larger coronary arteries and veins. Similar results were obtained for NRG-1α (not shown). Also, expression of NRG-1 mRNA was abundant in cultured CMVE and endocardial endothelium and remained nearly undetectable in cultured aortic endothelium (Fig. 1B). NRG-1 mRNA expression in CMVE significantly changed upon exposure of CMVE to a number of physiological stimuli. Endothelin-1 (100 nmol/liter) and cyclic mechanical strain (5%, 1 Hz) time-dependently up-regulated endothelial NRG-1 mRNA expression with a maximal increase of 11.8 ± 6.7-fold (n = 4, p = 0.01) after a 6-h incubation of endothelin-1 and of 3.5 ± 0.4-fold (n = 4, p = 0.04) after 4 h of cyclic mechanical strain (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows that the up-regulation of NRG-1 mRNA by cyclic mechanical strain was amplitude-dependent following a bell-shaped curve with a maximum at 1% strain. NRG-1 expression in CMVE was time-dependently down-regulated by angiotensin II (maximum 11.6 ± 5.4-fold, n = 4, p = 0.03) and phenylephrine (maximum 2.4 ± 0.5-fold, n = 4, p = 0.02) (Fig. 2C). The down-regulation by angiotensin II was dose-dependent with a maximal effect at 100 nmol/liter (Fig. 2D). NRG-1 expression was unaffected by tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β (data not shown). Up-regulation of NRG-1 expression by endothelin-1 and cyclic mechanical strain was confirmed at the protein level by immunoblot analysis. Fig. 3A shows that endothelin-1 and strain significantly increased the expression of a 115-kDa immunoreactive protein detected by immunoprecipitation with NRG Ab-1 and immunoblotting with C-20. This band corresponds to the transmembrane NRG-1 pro-protein (10Cote G.M. Miller T.A. LeBrasseur N.K. Kuramochi Y. Sawyer D.B. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 311: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, endothelin-1 and cyclic mechanical strain increased the presence in the culture medium of an ∼30-kDa protein detected by the NRG Ab-1 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that both stimuli also induce cleavage and release of NRG-1. Endothelin-1 and mechanical strain also increased the abundance of a 60-kDa immunoreactive protein (not shown), but it is not completely certain whether this band corresponds to a NRG-1 product (10Cote G.M. Miller T.A. LeBrasseur N.K. Kuramochi Y. Sawyer D.B. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 311: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Finally, regulation of NRG-1 mRNA expression in vivo was assessed during pressure overload in rat. At 8 weeks, TAC-induced pressure overload in rat resulted in concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (heart weight/body weight 5.1 ± 0.6 versus 3.4 ± 0.1 in sham, p < 0.05; left ventricular end diastolic volume 250 ± 26 versus 220 ± 20 in sham, p = 1.00, n = 5). At this stage, NRG-1 mRNA was 13.7 ± 5.5-fold increased in TAC versus sham (p = 0.02, n = 5) (Fig. 4A), and NRG-1 protein was 3.8 ± 0.1-fold increased in TAC versus sham (p < 0.01, n = 3) (Fig. 4B). At 16 weeks, TAC-induced pressure overload in rat resulted in eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy (heart weight/body weight 4.3 ± 0.3 versus 3.3 ± 0.17 in sham, p < 0.05; left ventricular end diastolic volume 350 ± 26 μl versus 226 ± 13 μl in sham, p < 0.05, n = 11) with reduced fractional shortening (fractional shortening 47 ± 4% versus 58 ± 2 in sham, p < 0.05, n = 11), hallmarks of left ventricle dysfunction and failure. At this stage, NRG-1 mRNA and protein expression levels fell to base-line values upon the transition to eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy and left ventricular dysfunction (Fig. 4). Activation of ErbB2—Fig. 5A shows that CMVE-conditioned medium induced phosphorylation of ErbB2 and subsequent activation of ERK1/2 in cardiomyocytes to the same extent as recombinant NRG-1β. A 24-h pretreatment of cardiomyocytes with anti-ErbB2 antibody was able to block both effects. In contrast with the known acute effects of this antibody, a 24-h treatment with anti-ErbB2 antibody did not induce receptor phosphorylation or activation of ERK. NRG-1 and the Hypertrophic Effects of CMVE on Cardiomyocytes—It has been shown previously that exogenous recombinant NRG-1β promotes hypertrophic growth of adult cardiac myocytes in vitro through ErbB4 (1Zhao Y.Y.

We investigated the role of endothelium-derived NRG-1β in the paracrine hypertrophic effects of CMVE on cardiomyocytes by analyzing (i) cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by medium conditioned by CMVE and (ii) cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by coculture with CMVE (communication through Transwell filters), both in the presence and absence of the inhibitory anti-ErbB2 antibody. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophic growth responses were assessed from BNP mRNA expression and cardiomyocyte surface area. As shown in Fig. 6A, a significant increase in BNP mRNA expression was identified in cardiomyocytes exposed for 24 h to NRG-1 (5.1 ± 0.9-fold increase, n = 5, p = 0.003 versus control), in cardiomyocytes exposed to CMVE-conditioned medium (3.7 ± 0.8-fold increase, n = 6, p = 0.01 versus control), and in cardiomyocytes co-cultured with CMVE (2.5 ± 1.1-fold increase, n = 8, p = 0.04 versus control). Consistently, NRG-1, CMVE-conditioned medium, and co-culture increased cell surface area (control, 1032 ± 41 μm2, n = 6; 72 h of NRG-1, 1418 ± 62 μm2, n = 6, p = 0.04; conditioned medium, 1856 ± 116 μm2, n = 6, p < 0.001; co-culture, 1525 ± 172 μm2, n = 4, p = 0.01). Co-culture of cardiomyocytes with aortic endothelial cells or AD293 cells had no effect (data not shown). Importantly, pretreating cardiomyocytes during 24 h with an anti-ErbB2 antibody (1 μg/ml) completely abolished the increase of BNP mRNA expression and of cell surface area induced by CMVE-conditioned medium and coculture (Fig. 6). NRG-1 and the Anti-apoptotic Effects of CMVE on Cardiomyocytes—It has been shown previously (9Fukazawa R. Miller T.A. Kuramochi Y. Frantz S. Kim Y.D. Marchionni M.A. Kelly R.A. Sawyer D.B. J. Mol.

Physiol. 2004; 286: C222-C229Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that exogenous recombinant NRG-1β protects adult cardiac myocytes against anthracycline and β-adrenergic receptor-induced apoptosis in vitro. We investigated the role of endothelium-derived NRG-1β in the paracrine anti-apoptotic effects of CMVE on cardiomyocytes. Daunorubicin (1 μmol/liter) induced a significant increase in TUNEL-positive nuclei from 10.6 ± 0.3% in control to 30.5 ± 2.1% after 24 h of daunorubicin treatment (n = 3, p = 0.001). When cardiomyocytes were pretreated with CMVE-conditioned medium or exogenous NRG-1β for 1 h, the apoptotic effect of daunorubicin was completely abrogated (TUNEL assay; daunorubicin plus conditioned medium, 10.3 ± 2.9%, n = 3, p = 0.001 versus daunorubicin alone; daunorubicin plus NRG-1β, 17.3 ± 0.4%, n = 3, p = 0.04 versus daunorubicin alone). Importantly, this anti-apoptotic effect of CMVE-conditioned medium was completely abolished by pretreating cardiomyocytes with anti-ErbB2 antibody (TUNEL assay, 31.3 ± 1.1%, n = 3, p = 0.001 versus control) (Fig. 7, A and B). Anti-ErbB2 antibody alone did not induce apoptosis and did not enhance anthracycline-induced apoptosis (not shown). Similar observations were made when apoptotic responses were analyzed with annexin labeling (Fig. 7C). During fetal maturation, NRG-1 plays a crucial role in cardiac development through activation of ErbB2 and ErbB4 oncogene receptors on cardiomyocytes (22Meyer D. Birchmeier C.

Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 4999-5011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies established a role for NRG-1 beyond cardiac development, but inconsistent conclusions have been made on the specific role of ErbB2 in the anti-apoptotic effects of NRG-1 in postnatal cardiomyocytes. Given the fact that monoclonal inhibitory antibodies against ErbB2 are efficient in the treatment of breast cancer but also induce cardiomyopathy, we further investigated the role of ErbB2 in the regulation of cardiomyocyte viability. After confirming that the cardiac endothelium is the main source of NRG-1 in the heart, we studied NRG-ErbB signaling by using experimental models of endothelium-cardiomyocyte cross-talk. Next, we showed that inhibition of ErbB2 phosphorylation and subsequent signaling with inhibitory monoclonal antibodies abrogated endothelium-induced growth and survival of cardiomyocytes, providing direct proof for a role of ErbB2 in endothelium-cardiomyocyte cross-talk and in the preservation of myocardial integrity. Our results on the obligatory role of ErbB2 in the anti-apoptotic effects of NRG-1 may appear somewhat surprising at first glance, especially because previous experiments with the same monoclonal antibody led to opposite conclusions. Closely comparing our experiments with those from Fukazawa et al. (9Fukazawa R. Miller T.A. Kuramochi Y. Frantz S. Kim Y.D. Marchionni M.A. Kelly R.A. Sawyer D.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) provide, however, a plausible explanation. First, Fukazawa et al. use this monoclonal antibody as a stimulatory antibody to selectively activate ErbB2. Indeed, consistent with our experiments, the authors show that the monoclonal antibody induces ErbB2 phosphorylation on cardiomyocytes, at least within the first minutes after administration. When subsequently assessing the anti-apoptotic effects of this antibody on cardiomyocytes, however, Fukazawa et al. preincubate the antibody for 24 h prior to exposing the cardiomyocytes to daunorubicin in the assumption that the stimulatory effects of the antibody on ErbB2 and subsequent signaling would last for so long. In contrast to this assumption, in our experiments, performed 24 h after administration, ErbB2 was indeed no longer phosphorylated and neither was downstream ERK-1. Instead, the antibody had become inhibitory, preventing the phosphorylation of ErbB2 and ERK-1 phosphorylation by cardiac endothelial cells and recombinant NRG-1. It has been previously demonstrated (27Yarden Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2569-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28Klapper L.N. Vaisman N. Hurwitz E.

Immunother. 2002; 50: 569-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that inhibitory ErbB2 antibodies can transiently stimulate receptor phosphorylation but function only as partial agonists. The prolonged inhibitory effect is due to the acceleration of endocytosis and degradation of the ErbB2 receptor. Second, Fukazawa et al. (9Fukazawa R. Miller T.A. Kuramochi Y. Frantz S. Kim Y.D. Marchionni M.A. Kelly R.A. Sawyer D.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) investigate the effects of the antibody on daunorubicin-induced apoptosis per se, i.e. in the absence of other stimuli, and observe no effect of the antibody. This result is identical to ours; yet in parallel experiments, we showed that the antibody inhibited the protective effects of cardiac endothelial cells and of recombinant NRG-1. Based on these results, we conclude that ErbB2 does participate in cardiomyocyte anti-apoptotic NRG-1 signaling and believe we have resolved at least some of the controversy. There is substantial experimental evidence that cardiac endothelial cells in the endocardium and in the coronary microvasculature directly affect the cardiac mechanical performance, growth, and rhythmicity of the adjacent myocardium. These effects appear to be mediated by diffusible substances (such as nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and endothelin-1) and as more recently demonstrated by NRG-1 (30Brutsaert D.L. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 59-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Non-paracrine interactions between endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, involving endothelium-dependent electrochemical gradients, have also been described, at least for the endocardial endothelium (31Fransen P. Lamberts R.R. Hendrickx J. De Keulenaer G.W. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 63: 700-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Endothelial activation and subsequent dysfunction occur in response to physiological and pathophysiological stimuli and are early events in cardiovascular homeostasis and disease (30Brutsaert D.L. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 59-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that endothelial NRG-1 synthesis is sensitive to modulation by angiotensin-II and phenylephrine. These hormones are adaptively released in the circulation in conditions of low blood pressure to enhance cardiac output and to increase peripheral resistance. The suppressive actions of both hormones on endothelial NRG-1 signaling fit with these blood pressure-enhancing actions, as they will reduce the anti-adrenergic activity of NRG-1 on the heart (32Lemmens K. Fransen P. Sys S.U. Brutsaert D.L. De Keulenaer G.W. Circulation. 2004; 109: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 33Lemmens K. Segers V.F. De Keulenaer G.W. Circulation. 2005; 111: e175Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Consistently, increased mechanical deformation and endothelin-1, characteristic for hypertensive states, have opposite effects on endothelial NRG-1. Finally, to what extent beneficial effects of pharmacological angiotensin II and phenylephrine blockade in chronic heart failure (34McMurray J.J. J. Renin. Angiotensin. Aldosterone. Syst. 2004; 5: S17-S22Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 35Clark A.L. Cleland J.G. Heart Fail. Rev. 2000; 5: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) are related to the effects on endothelial NRG-1 is unknown but deserves further investigation. In pressure overload-induced hypertrophy, NRG-1 was upregulated, but this up-regulation faded away upon the transition to left ventricular dysfunction and failure. We speculate that the increase in NRG-1 expression is an adaptive response to mechanical overload (consistent with the up-regulation of NRG-1 by cyclic mechanical strain in vitro) but that subsequent activation of neurohormonal factors, such as angiotensin II and phenylephrine, exerts opposing effects on NRG-1 expression, thereby decreasing the expression levels. Therefore, it would be interesting to investigate whether pharmacological inhibition of angiotensin II and phenylephrine preserves high protective levels of NRG-1 in the cardiac endothelium during progression of heart failure and to what extent this effect contributes to the beneficial effects of these drugs. Cardiac endothelial cells release several isoforms of NRG-1. Consistently, in our experiments, several bands were detected by immunoblotting NRG-1 from endothelial cell lysates. Interestingly, apart from a 115-kDa band and several somewhat smaller bands known to correspond to the transmembrane NRG pro-protein (10Cote G.M. Miller T.A. LeBrasseur N.K. Kuramochi Y. Sawyer D.B.

https://openalex.org/W2117260419,"The AUX1 and PIN auxin influx and efflux facilitators are key regulators of root growth and development. For root gravitropism to occur, AUX1 and PIN2 must transport auxin via the lateral root cap to elongating epidermal cells. Genetic studies suggest that AXR4 functions in the same pathway as AUX1. Here we show that AXR4 is a previously unidentified accessory protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that regulates localization of AUX1 but not of PIN proteins. Loss of AXR4 resulted in abnormal accumulation of AUX1 in the ER of epidermal cells, indicating that the axr4 agravitropic phenotype is caused by defective AUX1 trafficking in the root epidermis."

Although the α1 knockdown resulted in significant decreases in Na/K-ATPase activity, it increased the basal Src activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, a Src effector.

In addition, ouabain was able to stimulate Src and ERK1/2 in the rescued cells at a much higher concentration, consistent with the established differences in ouabain sensitivity between pig and rat α1. Finally both fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis and co-immunoprecipitation assay indicated that the pumping-null rat α1 (D371E) mutant could also bind Src.

Na/K-ATPase was discovered by Skou (1Skou J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 23: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar) as the molecular machinery of the cellular sodium pump. It belongs to a family of evolutionarily ancient ATPases that couple the hydrolysis of ATP to membrane ion translocation (2Kaplan J.H. Annu. Rev.

A major difference between the Na/K-ATPase and other ATPases is its ability to bind cardiotonic steroids such as ouabain. Studies from many laboratories have now established that the binding of ouabain to this enzyme not only inhibits the ATPase activity but also stimulates protein tyrosine kinases such as Src (4Haas M.

Using in vitro glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays we have identified that the second and the third intracellular domains of the Na/K-ATPase α1 subunit interact with the Src SH2 and the kinase domains, respectively. Functionally these interactions keep Src in an inactive state, and binding of ouabain to this inactive Na/K-ATPase·Src complex frees and then activates the associated Src (10Tian J. Cai T. Yuan Z.

These new findings suggest that the cellular Src-interacting Na/K-ATPase may play an important role in regulation of the basal Src activity and serve as a functional receptor for ouabain to stimulate protein tyrosine phosphorylation in live cells. To test this hypothesis we have developed an siRNA-based assay that allows us to determine the effect of changes in the amount and properties of the Na/K-ATPase on both basal and ouabain-stimulated Src activity.

Briefly four pairs of oligonucleotides (A1-A4) were synthesized using the human α1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_000701) as template (see Table 1 for details), and the inserts were prepared by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides. The annealed inserts were then cloned into pSuppressor™-U6 vector digested with SalI and XbaI.

Carr D.L. Guerrero G. Pressley T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To make the expression of rat α1 insensitive to A4 siRNA, the α1 siRNA-targeted sequence was silently mutated from 2530ggtcgtctgatcttt (GenBank™ accession number NM_012504) to 2530ggcaggctaatattc using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit. The SspI (aat/att) restriction site was generated to facilitate the clone screening. The positive mutant (pRc/CMV-α1AACm1 or AAC in short) was verified by DNA sequencing and then used in this study. The pumping-null mutant (D371E) was generated by mutating the 1126gacaag to 1126gagaag using pRc/CMV-α1AACm1 as the template (13Ohtsubo M. Noguchi S. Takeda K. Morohashi M. Kawamura M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Generation of Stable α1 Subunit Knockdown and Knock-in Cell Lines—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transiently transfected with different siRNA expression vectors along with pEYFP using Lipofectamine 2000 as we described previously (11Wang H. Haas M. Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Li S. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17250-17259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). After 48 h, cells were first examined for the expression of EYFP for assessing the transfection efficiency and then collected for analysis of endogenous α1 content by Western blot. To generate stable cell lines, one batch of LLC-PK1 cells was transfected with the A4 siRNA expression vector (pSuppressor-A4 siRNA) (Table 1) and a puromycin selection marker (pBade-puro). Another batch of cells was co-transfected with pEYFP together with the pSuppressor-A4 siRNA and pBade-puro so that the co-expressed EYFP could be used as a marker to pick clones. Empty vector (pSuppressor) or A1 siRNA-transfected cells were co-selected and used as a control. The cells were selected with puromycin (1 μg/ml) 24 h posttransfection. Puromycin-resistant colonies were cloned and expanded. To rescue the Na/K-ATPase knockdown cells, cells were transfected with the pRc/CMV-α1AACm1. Selection was initiated with 3 μm ouabain because untransfected cells were very sensitive to ouabain. After about 1 week, ouabain-resistant colonies were isolated and expanded into stable cell lines in the absence of ouabain. G418 was not used because these cells are resistant to it, requiring more than 3 mg/ml to kill the untransfected cells. The knockdown cells were also sensitive to blasticidin (15 μg/ml), and we have recently used this agent for other selections. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were washed with PBS, solubilized in modified ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and subjected to immunoprecipitation or Western blot analysis as described previously (11Wang H. Haas M. Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Li S. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17250-17259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Protein signal was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit and quantified using a Bio-Rad GS-670 imaging densitometer. Na/K-ATPase Activity Assay—Na/K-ATPase enzymatic activity was determined as we described previously (14Xie Z.J. Wang Y.H. Ganjeizadeh M. McGee Jr., R. Askari A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly cells were collected from the cultures in Tris-EGTA buffer (pH 7.2) and briefly sonicated. The cell lysates were then treated with alamethicin at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mg of protein for 30 min at room temperature. ATPase activity was measured by the determination of the initial release of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP, and the reaction was carried out in a reaction mixture (1 ml) containing 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2,1mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm NaN3, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Na/K-ATPase activity was calculated as the difference between the activities measured in the absence of ouabain and in the presence of 1 mm ouabain. To determine the ouabain concentration curve, the alamethicin-treated cell lysates were preincubated with different concentrations of ouabain for 15 min before ATP was added to start the reaction. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells cultured on coverslips were washed twice with PBS and fixed for 15 min with methanol prechilled at -20 °C. The fixed cells were then rinsed with PBS three times and blocked with 200 μl of Image-iT FX signal enhancer for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed again and incubated with the primary antibodies in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with corresponding Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies. Image visualization was performed using a Leica DMIRE2 confocal microscope (Leica, Mannheim, Germany). Leica confocal software was used for data analysis. FRET Analysis by Acceptor Photobleaching—ECFP was fused to the C terminus of Src, and EYFP was fused to the N terminus of rat Na/K-ATPase α1 subunit or its mutant. FRET analysis was performed in cells co-transfected with Src-ECFP and EYFP-rat α1 expression vectors using the acceptor photobleaching protocol as we described previously (10Tian J. Cai T. Yuan Z. Wang H. Liu L. Haas M. Maksimova E. Huang X.Y. Xie Z.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Briefly after 24 h culture, cells on a glass coverslip were fixed with methanol prechilled at -20 °C for 15 min and washed twice with PBS solution. The EYFP-rat α1 was photobleached by applying a high intensity 515 nm laser, and the emission of ECFP excited by 456 nm laser was recorded before (Dpre) and after (Dpost) EYFP photobleaching. The FRET efficiency was then calculated by the ratio of (Dpost-Dpre)/Dpre. Cells transfected with either Src-ECFP and EYFP or EYFP-α1 and ECFP expression vectors were used as a control, and no detectable FRET was observed in these control cells. Data Analysis—Data are given as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test, and significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Manipulation of the Cellular Na/K-ATPase Content by siRNA-based Assays—As shown in Table 1, a total of four pairs of the α1-specific siRNAs was selected based on the strategy we used previously (11Wang H. Haas M. Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Li S. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17250-17259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Transient transfection assay in human embryonic kidney 293T cells showed that expression of A4 siRNA resulted in over 40% decreases in the expression of the human α1 subunit, whereas others gave 0 (A1 siRNA) to 20% (A2 and A3 siRNAs) reduction. Because the transfection efficiency was about 50% as indicated by the co-expressed EYFP, we reasoned that A4 siRNA is effective in silencing the expression of endogenous Na/K-ATPase. Therefore, LLC-PK1 cells were transfected with A4 siRNA expression vector (pSuppressor-A4 siRNA) and a puromycin selection marker (pBade-puro) either with or without pEYFP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After two rounds of selection, we collected 20 stable transfectants. Western blot analysis using a monoclonal (α6F) antibody showed that the expression of the α1 subunit in these clones was significantly reduced in comparison with the control P-11 cells that were transfected with empty vector (pSuppressor) and selected. In contrast, cell clones (e.g. A1) obtained from the LLC-PK1 cells that were transfected with A1 siRNA expressed α1 at a level comparable to that in P-11 cells (see Table 2). Therefore, we expanded and further characterized three A4 siRNA-expressing clones. As shown in Fig. 1A, expression of the α1 subunit was significantly reduced in A4-11, TCN23-19, and PY-17 cells. Of these cell lines, the PY-17 cells, which were cloned by using the co-expressed EYFP as a marker, expressed the lowest level of the Na/K-ATPase. Table 2 shows the quantitative data on the relative amount of the α1 in these and other cell lines we generated. Because control Western blot using purified Na/K-ATPase prepared from pig kidney showed that it was only possible to perform reasonable quantitative assay comparing two samples with less than 6-fold differences in the amount of α1 (data not shown), we measured the relative amount of α1 in these cells by comparing A4-11 with the control P-11 and then TCN23-19 and PY-17 with A4-11. To confirm the above Western blot data, we also probed the blots with a different anti-Na/K-ATPase α1 monoclonal antibody (clone C464.6) and an anti-Na/K-ATPaseα1 polyclonal antibody, showing essentially the same results as in Fig. 1A. In addition, when co-cultured P-11 and PY-17 cells were immunostained using anti-Na/K-ATPase α1 antibody (clone C464.6), we found that the green PY-17 cells exhibited no detectable expression of the α1, whereas the plasma membrane of control P-11 cells was clearly labeled by the antibody (Fig. 1B). To be sure that knockdown of the α1 subunit does not induce the expression of other isoforms, we analyzed the cell lysates for both α2 and α3 and found no detectable signals in the above cell lines. Finally when ouabain-sensitive ATPase activity was measured in the cell lysates, a significant (80%) reduction was noted in the PY-17 cells in comparison with the control P-11 cells (Table 3).TABLE 2Relative α1 subunit protein content and the composition of DNA constructs used in different cell linesCell linesRelative α1 content (mean ± S.E.)DNA constructs used in transfection%P-11100pSuppressor, pBade-puroA197.4 ± 2.1pSuppressor-A1 siRNA, pBade-puroA4-1144.1 ± 2.3pSuppressor-A4 siRNA, pBade-puroTCN23-1912.0 ± 4pSuppressor-A4 siRNA, pBade-puroPY-177.5 ± 3.0pSuppressor-A4 siRNA, pBade-puro, pEYFPPY-17-AAC-M1-19 (AAC-19)93.7 ± 9.9pSuppressor-A4 siRNA, pBade-puro, pEYFP, pRc/CMV-α1AACm1 (rat α1) Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Na/K-ATPase activity in different cell linesCell lineActivity%P-11100PY-1720.8 ± 3.7AAC-1992.2 ± 6.4 Open table in a new tab Because PY-17 cells have very low endogenous Na/K-ATPase, these cells will be very useful for studying the structure-function properties of the Na/K-ATPase if we can rescue the cells by knocking in an exogenous α1. To test this possibility, we first made silent mutations of the rat α1 cDNA to change the siRNA-targeted sequence. We then transfected PY-17 cells with the mutated rat α1 expression vector (pRc/CMV-α1AACm1) and generated several stable transfectants. Further analysis of the clone AAC-19 showed that these cells, unlike both P-11 and PY-17, expressed rat α1 (Fig. 2A). When the same blots were analyzed for total α1 using the monoclonal anti-α1 antibody (α6F), we found that AAC-19 cells expressed an amount of α1 comparable to that in control P-11 cells (Fig. 2A). This result was further confirmed by immunostaining of the co-cultured P-11 and AAC-19 cells using anti-α1 (clone C464.6) antibody. As depicted in Fig. 2B, the green AAC-19 and control P-11 cells exhibited similar levels of the Na/K-ATPase in the plasma membrane. Control experiments also demonstrated that the rat α1 was stably expressed in this cell line for at least 20 passages in the absence of ouabain. Functionally knock-in of the rat α1 into PY-17 cells was able to restore Na/K-ATPase activity (Table 3). Most importantly, it shifted the dose-response curve of ouabain on the ATPase activity and made the rescued cells less ouabain-sensitive. In fact, the rescued cells behave as rat cell lines (5Haas M. Wang H. Tian J. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18694-18702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) that express only the α1 isoform (Fig. 3). It is important to note that PY-17 cells were as sensitive to ouabain as the control P-11 cells and that 10 μm ouabain caused a complete inhibition of the Na/K-ATPase.FIGURE 3Concentration-dependent effects of ouabain (oua) on the Na/K-ATPase activity. Whole cell lysates from P-11 and AAC-19 cells were prepared and assayed for the Na/K-ATPase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are shown as percentage of control, and each point is presented as mean ± S.E. of four independent experiments. Curve fit analysis was performed by GraphPad software.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Regulation of Basal Src Activity by the Na/K-ATPase—Our in vitro studies have shown that the Na/K-ATPase directly binds and keeps Src in an inactive state. If this mode of regulation operates in live cells, we would expect that reduction of intracellular Na/K-ATPase will decrease the interaction, resulting in an increase in basal Src activity. To test this, we measured the phosphorylation of Src (Tyr(P)418-Src), indicative of Src activation (4Haas M. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27832-27837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 10Tian J. Cai T. Yuan Z. Wang H. Liu L. Haas M. Maksimova E. Huang X.Y. Xie Z.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), in the cell lysates from the above cell lines. As depicted in Fig. 4A, the expression of total Src was not altered by knockdown of the endogenous Na/K-ATPase. However, the levels of active Src were significantly increased in A4-11, TCN23-19, and PY-17 cells. Interestingly the increase in Src activity appeared to be inversely correlated with the amounts of Na/K-ATPase expressed in these cells (Fig. 4B). These findings were further confirmed by immunostaining the cells with anti-Tyr(P)418-Src antibody, showing that TCN23-19 cells contained much more active Src than P-11 cells contained (Fig. 4C). It is important to note that there was no difference in the amount of active Src between two control cell lines, P-11 and A1 cells (data not shown). To test whether the increase in Src activity due to the decreased expression of the Na/K-ATPase is reversible upon repletion of the Na/K-ATPase, we determined the total Src and the active Src in AAC-19 cells. As depicted in Fig. 2, AAC-19 cells were derived from the rat α1-transfected PY-17 cells and expressed an amount of the Na/K-ATPase comparable to that in control P-11 cells. Although knock-in of the rat α1 did not change the total Src in AAC-19 cells, it did reduce the level of the active Src to that seen in control P-11 cells (Fig. 5, A and B). As illustrated in Table 3, the Na/K-ATPase activity was reduced 80% in PY-17 cells. When intracellular Na+ was measured after the cells were incubated in 22Na+ (0.5 μCi/ml) medium for 60 min to fully equilibrate exchangeable intracellular Na+ with 22Na+ (15Kim D. Barry W.H. Smith T.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1984; 231: 326-333PubMed Google Scholar), we found that the steady state intracellular Na+ in PY-17 cells was about twice as much as in P-11 cells. 3L. Liu and Z. Xie, unpublished data. To be sure that changes in Src activity observed in AAC-19 cells are not due to the restoration of the functional Na/K-ATPase and subsequent decreases in intracellular Na+, we tested whether knock-in of a pumping-null mutant of the rat α1 is sufficient for the observed interaction between the Na/K-ATPase and Src. PY-17 cells were transiently transfected with either silently mutated wild-type rat α1 (pRc/CMV-α1AACm1) or the rat α1 pumping-null mutant (D371E). As shown in Fig. 5C, expression of either ratα1 or the mutant reduced active Src in PY-17 cells. To further confirm these findings, we also transiently transfected TCN23-19 cells with the EYFP-fused ratα1 mutant expression vector (pEYFP-D371E) and immunostained for active Src. As depicted in Fig. 5D, the cells expressing the ratα1 mutant had much less active Src in comparison with the untransfected TCN23-19 cells. These data suggest that the pumping-null Na/K-ATPase mutant is still able to interact and regulate Src. To seek additional support for this notion, we also performed FRET analysis in TCN23-19 cells transiently transfected with EYFP-rat α1 mutant (D371E) and Src-ECFP expression vectors. As depicted in Fig. 6A, the pumping-null mutant was targeted to the plasma membrane. When FRET was measured in these transfected cells by acceptor photobleaching protocol, an energy transfer from Src-ECFP to EYFP-D371E was clearly demonstrated (Fig. 6B). The FRET efficiency measured from a total of 20 cells in three separate experiments ranged from 10.4 to 15.6 (13.2 ± 1.4). These data indicate that the pumping-null Na/K-ATPase acts like the wildtype α1 (10Tian J. Cai T. Yuan Z. Wang H. Liu L. Haas M. Maksimova E. Huang X.Y. Xie Z.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and can interact with Src to form a signaling complex. This conclusion is further supported by the co-immunoprecipitation assay showing that the ratα1 mutant could be co-precipitated by anti-Src antibody (Fig. 6C).FIGURE 6Interaction between Src and the pumping-null Na/K-ATPase. A and B, TCN23-19 cells were co-transfected with Src-ECFP and EYFP-rat α1 mutant (D371E) expression vectors. After 24 h, FRET analysis was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Boxed ROI_1 (green) was photobleached, and the ROI_3 (yellow) membrane area was analyzed for FRET. The boxed ROI_2 (purple) was selected and served as a non-bleaching control. The experiments were repeated three times, and a total of 20 cells were analyzed. C, TCN23-19 cells were transiently transfected as in A with either silently mutated wild-type rat α1(AAC) or rat α1 pumping-null mutant (D371E) expression vectors. After 36 h, cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation using monoclonal anti-Src (clone GD11) antibody. Immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by Western blot using either anti-NASE antibody (for rat α1) or anti-c-Src (SRC2) antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2009662773,"Rac1 is an intracellular signal transducer regulating a variety of cell functions. Previous studies by overexpression of dominant-negative or constitutively active mutants of Rac1 in clonal cell lines have established that Rac1 plays a key role in actin lamellipodia induction, cell-matrix adhesion, and cell anoikis. In the present studies, we have examined the cellular behaviors of Rac1 gene-targeted primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) after Cre recombinase-mediated deletion of Rac1 gene. Rac1-null MEFs became contracted and elongated in morphology and were defective in lamellipodia formation, cell spreading, cell-fibronectin adhesion, and focal contact formation in response to platelet-derived growth factor or serum. Unexpectedly, deletion of Rac1 also abolished actin stress fibers in the cells without detectable alteration of endogenous RhoA activity. Although the expression and/or activation status of focal adhesion complex components such as Src, FAK, and vinculin were not affected by Rac1 deletion, the number and size of adhesion plaques were significantly reduced, and the molecular complex between Src, FAK, and vinculin was dissembled in Rac1-null cells. Overexpression of an active RhoA mutant or ROK failed to rescue the stress fiber and adhesion plaque defects of the Rac1-null cells. Although Rac1 deletion caused a significant reduction in phospho-PAK1, -AKT, and -ERK under serum stimulation, reconstitution of active PAK1, but not AKT or MEK1, was able to rescue the actin cytoskeleton and adhesion phenotypes of the Rac1-deficient cells. Furthermore, Rac1 deletion led to a marked increase in spontaneous apoptosis that could be rescued by active PAK1, AKT, or MEK1 expression. Our results obtained from gene-targeted primary MEFs indicate that Rac1 is essential not only for lamellipodia induction but also for the RhoA-regulated actin stress fiber and focal adhesion complex formation and that Rac1 is involved in cell survival regulation through anoikis-dependent as well as -independent mechanisms."

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 4Sinensky M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Typical examples of prenylated proteins are small GTPases such as Ras, which is farnesylated, and the Rho family of GTPases, which is geranylgeranylated (5Coxon F.P. Ebetino F.H. Mules E.H.

Prenylation has been shown to be crucial to the targeting and activity of GTPases that are involved in cell growth and survival, motility, cytoskeletal regulation, intracellular transport, and secretion (8Coxon F.P.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10542-10549Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In mammals, as in most eukaryotes, isoprenoid synthesis proceeds through the mevalonate pathway starting from acetyl-CoA with the intermediates hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA, mevalonate, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), and FPP (Fig. 1A). Farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) resides at a key branch point of the pathway, because it produces precursors for all isoprenoids. Several enzymes in the pathway constitute important and well established drug targets, for example statins are used to lower cholesterol levels by inhibiting the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase. Another class of drugs in clinical use are the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs) that inhibit FPPS, used to treat disorders characterized by bone resorption such as osteoporosis, Paget disease, or multiple myeloma (10Russell R.G. Rogers M.J. Bone. 1999; 25: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Further targets for drug development presently being explored are the protein prenyltransferases for the treatment of cancer (11Basso A.D. Kirschmeier P. Bishop W.R. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 15-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) or FPPS from protozoan parasites for the treatment of malaria, Leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease (12Cheng F.

Oldfield E. Urbina J.A. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 2004; 23: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We recently determined the structure of human FPPS and were able to deduce the molecular mechanism of N-BP inhibition (14Kavanagh K.L. Guo K. Dunford J.E. Wu X. Knapp S. Ebetino F.H. Rogers M.J. Russell R.G.G. Oppermann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7829-7834Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In this study we describe the structure of human geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPS), the enzyme producing the isoprenoid molecule essential for geranylgeranylation of proteins. The enzyme is a potential drug target for oncology and bone disorders. GGPS predominantly catalyzes the condensation of IPP with FPP to obtain the C20 product GGPP, although it can utilize DMAPP or GPP as alternate allylic substrates (Fig. 1B). The enzyme is 17% identical to human FPPS, sharing key consensus regions and possibly a common catalytic mechanism. Currently, structural information is only available for one archaeal (PDB code 1WY0), one fungal (PDB code 2DH4), and one bacterial ortholog (PDB code 1WMW) sharing ∼20-44% sequence identity and displaying different quaternary structures. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Human GGPS—A clone encoding human GGPS encompassing residues 1-300 (derived from clone accession number gi 4758430) as an N-terminally His6-tagged fusion protein with a TEV protease cleavage site was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). In brief, 10 ml of overnight culture were used to inoculate 1 liter of Terrific Broth containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin. Cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 1 and were then cooled to 18 °C before being induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and cultured overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of binding buffer (500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm TCEP) with protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science), followed by lysis using a high pressure cell disrupter. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation before applying to a pre-equilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) column with a 3-ml bed volume. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of binding buffer, 10 column volumes of wash buffer (500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 30 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm TCEP), and eluted in 12 ml of the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The hexahistidine tag was removed by incubation with His-tagged TEV protease (50 μg/mg of recombinant GGPS) for 48 h at 4 °C, followed by removal of His-tagged protein by passing the digest over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and collecting the unbound fraction. The TEV-cleaved protein was further purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 column on an ÄKTA purifier system (GE Healthcare). Purity and integrity of GGPS were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (Agilent). Selenomethionine Labeling—Selenomethionine-substituted protein was produced using cells grown in SelenoMet medium (Molecular Dimensions) in the presence of 75 mg/liter selenomethionine together with amino acids suppressing de novo synthesis of methionine (15Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Labeled GGPS was purified as described for the native protein, and the incorporation of selenomethionine was confirmed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of native protein were grown at 20 °C in sitting drops by mixing 200 nl of 90 mg/ml protein in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol with 100 nl of precipitant solution consisting of 25% PEG 3350, 200 mm magnesium formate, pH 5.5, and equilibrating against 100 μl of the precipitant solution. A single crystal was transferred to a cryo-protectant prepared with 20% glycerol, 80% well solution and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. A native data set was collected at a wavelength of 1.008 Å at the Swiss Light Source PXII beamline. Data processing indicated the space group was either P41212 or P43212, and calculation of a Matthews coefficient of 2.5 implied six monomers per asymmetric unit. Attempts at molecular replacement using models with ∼20% sequence identity were unsuccessful (after this structure was deposited, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae form of GGPS with 44% identity became available). Selenomethionine-labeled protein was crystallized by suspending a 3-μl drop containing 26 mg/ml protein, 333 mm NaCl, 0.67 mm MgCl2, 0.67 mm GGPP, 3% glycerol, 15% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 1.7% PEG 10,000, 6.7 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, over a 1-ml reservoir containing 45% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 5% PEG 10,000. A single crystal was flashed-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected for the selenomethionine derivative at the Swiss Light Source PXII beamline at 0.9791 Å (peak wavelength determined from a fluorescence scan). Data sets were processed using XDS (16Kabsch W. Arnold E. Rossmann M.G. International Tables for Crystallography. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands2001: 218-225Google Scholar), and data statistics are shown in Table 1. Data processing confirmed a P1 unit cell for the derivative crystal, and analysis of solvent content predicted 12 monomers in the unit cell.TABLE 1Data processing and refinement statistics Values in parentheses are for data in highest shell. r.m.s.d. indicates root mean square deviation.NativeSelenomethionineSpace groupP41212P1Unit cell (Å and degrees)a = b = 141.2, c = 211.7a = 82.05, b = 102.8, c = 139.7, α = 69.36, β = 81.51, γ = 70.27No. of reflections458,740730,472No. of unique data59,48296,958Resolution (Å)47.1-2.70 (2.80-2.70)49.1-2.80 (2.90-2.80)Completeness99.9% (100.0%)98.0% (97.4%)〈I/σ(I) 〉12.1 (2.8)23.2 (5.7)Rint0.1365 (0.5221)0.0718 (0.2543)Final modelRcryst/Rfree0.21/0.25R.m.s.d. bond length (Å)0.014R.m.s.d bond angle (°)1.454Protein atoms (6 chains)13,723GGPP atoms164Magnesium ions12Water molecules24 Open table in a new tab Structure Solution, Model Building, and Refinement—Before merging the selenomethionine data set, the anomalous signal was assessed by calculating ΔF/σ using the program XPREP (Bruker AXS, 2005) indicating significant signal to 4.0 Å. Forty eight selenium sites (corresponding to 12 chains) were easily found using SHELXD (17Sheldrick G.M. Hauptman H.A. Weeks C.M. Miller M. Usón I. Arnold E. Rossmann M.G. International Tables for Crystallography. F. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands2001: 333-351Google Scholar) with convincing statistics. Noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) analysis was performed manually by assigning selenium sites to their NCS equivalents, and NCS matrices were calculated using LSQKAB (18Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. 1976; A32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2354) Google Scholar). Initial phases were calculated using SHELXE (19Sheldrick G.M. Z. Kristallogr. 2002; 217: 644-650Crossref Scopus (360) Google Scholar), and NCS averaging was performed with dm (20Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) using an NCS mask calculated from the selenium positions (a 15-Å radius sphere was used around each selenium atom to construct the mask). Visual inspection of the electron density clearly indicated there were two hexamers in the P1 unit cell. An initial model for a single chain was built into the density-modified P1 maps using the program COOT (21Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23370) Google Scholar). Subsequently, molecular replacement was performed with PHASER (22McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar) on the native data set testing both enantiomeric space groups in the tetragonal unit cell. A solution was found for six monomers in the P41212 unit cell with similar hexameric arrangement as seen in the P1 cell. Before refinement commenced, 5% of the data were flagged for calculation of Rfree. Iterative rounds of refinement using REFMAC5 (23Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13868) Google Scholar) and manual fitting in COOT converged to the final model for which statistics are shown in Table 1. Tight main chain and medium side chain NCS restraints were used throughout the refinement process. Sequence Alignment—Sequences were extracted from NCBI and were aligned using the program ICM (Molsoft, San Diego) with the implemented alignment tool. The four GGPS crystal structures (from human, Thermus thermophilus, Pyrococcus horikoshi, and S. cerevisiae) were superimposed and used as template to compare all primary structures. Obvious misalignments in the resulting output file were manually adjusted to obtain the final alignment. Determination of Molecular Weight in Solution—The molecular weight of GGPS was measured by gel filtration chromatography using an ÄKTA purifier system. GGPS (3 mg) was applied to a calibrated Superdex 200 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) column and developed with 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm TCEP at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The molecular mass in solution was estimated by comparing the retention time of GGPS to the standard curve obtained with molecular weight markers (Sigma). Kinetics of Recombinant Human GGPS—GGPS activity was analyzed by the method of Reed and Rilling (24Reed B.C. Rilling H.C. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3739-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. In brief, 80 ng (2 pmol) was assayed in a final volume of 100 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm TCEP, 5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Tween 20. The concentrations of FPP and IPP ([14C]IPP, 400 kBq/μmol) were as indicated and were typically between 0.2 and 20 μm. For inhibition studies, the concentration of GGPP varied from 0.4 to 40 μm. Reactions were initiated by addition of enzyme and were allowed to proceed at 37 °C. Assays were terminated by the addition of 0.2 ml of HCl/methanol (1:4) and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were extracted with 0.4 ml of ligroin and, after thorough mixing, the amount of radioactivity in the upper phase was determined using a Packard Tricarb 1900CA scintillation counter by adding 0.2 ml of the ligroin to 4 ml of general purpose scintillant. Data were fitted by nonlinear regression to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the Graphpad Prism software package or to a competitive inhibition model using the enzyme kinetics module in Sigmaplot. Analysis of Reaction Products—Enzyme reactions were performed as described above except that [14C]IPP (2.18 GBq/mmol) was employed at a concentration of 17 μm, and the reactions were carried out in 50-μl volumes. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 μg of protein and stopped after 5 min by the addition of 2 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. Enzyme reaction products were analyzed using thin layer chromatography by spotting 5 μl of the reaction mixture onto Silica Gel 60 TLC plates (Merck) that were developed in propan-2-ol/ammonia/water (6:3:1). Standards were visualized by staining with iodine vapor, and radioactivity was visualized using a Storm860 PhosphorImaging system (GE Healthcare). Biochemical Analysis of Recombinant Human GGPS—Size-exclusion chromatography of recombinant GGPS revealed a molecular mass of 193 kDa (Fig. 2A) which, given a monomeric molecular mass of 34.96 kDa, suggests there are 5-6 monomers associated per molecule in solution. This is consistent with previous studies that estimate that GGPS from bovine brain is a 195-kDa homo-oligomer (25Sagami H. Morita Y. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20561-20566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but deviates, however, from a study showing that human GGPS is a 280-kDa octamer (26Kuzuguchi T. Morita Y. Sagami I. Sagami H. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5888-5894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Importantly, these data confirm that the crystallographic model containing six monomers (see below) is the biologically relevant unit. Human GGPS expressed in E. coli as an N-terminal His-tagged protein was used to study steady-state kinetics and to ensure that the enzyme used for crystallization was active. The tagged and TEV-cleaved forms of the enzyme were tested for activity, and it was found that the presence of the tag had no significant effect on enzyme activity (data not shown). GGPS generated 14C-labeled acid-labile products using DMAPP, GPP, or FPP as a substrate. This activity was stimulated by the addition of 0.2% Tween 20 to the reaction (Fig. 2B), which is consistent with the finding that octyl glucoside increases activity for the bovine form of the enzyme (25Sagami H. Morita Y. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20561-20566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of reaction mixtures by thin layer chromatography showed that the enzyme has a strong preference for FPP as the allylic substrate in agreement with previous observations (26Kuzuguchi T. Morita Y. Sagami I. Sagami H. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5888-5894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Significant to the structural results discussed below, the ultimate product of the GGPS-catalyzed reaction is GGPP, and reactions set up using GGPP as allylic substrate showed no further chain elongation. Steady-state kinetic constants were calculated by varying the concentration of one substrate while holding the concentration of the second substrate constant (Table 2 and Fig. 2, C and D). The enzyme catalyzes the production of GGPP with a kcat = 0.204 s−1 and apparent Km values of 3.0 μm (IPP) and 4.2 μm (FPP). The Michaelis constants are in general agreement with reported values for the bovine brain (Km, IPP = 2 μm and Km, FPP = 0.74 μm) and yeast enzymes (Km, IPP = 0.8 μm and Km, FPP = 3.2 μm) (25Sagami H.

Chem. 2006; 281: 14991-15000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although the kcat is 2-fold lower than that determined for human FPPS (kcat = 0.42 s−1), it is an order of magnitude higher than the reported value for S. cerevisiae GGPS (kcat = 0.025 s−1) and is therefore within the range expected for this class of enzymes (14Kavanagh K.L. Guo K. Dunford J.E. Wu X. Knapp S. Ebetino F.H. Rogers M.J. Russell R.G.G. Oppermann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7829-7834Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 27Chang T.H.

Biophys. Acta. 1981; 661: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), no substrate inhibition was observed at IPP concentrations up to 100 μm. However, the product GGPP was found to inhibit the enzyme competitively with respect to FPP with a Ki of 25 μm.TABLE 2Steady-state kinetic parameters for recombinant human GGPSConstantIPPFPPKm (μm)3.0 ± 0.24.2 ± 0.3Vmax (nmol/min/nmol)12.7kcat (FPP as substrate)0.204 s−1 Open table in a new tab Overall Structure of Human GGPS—The crystallographic asymmetric unit for the native protein contains six protein chains (A-F), each associated with two Mg2+ ions and one GGPP molecule (Fig. 3A). Except for subunit F in which the GGPP molecule is disordered past C-10, the refined B-factors for the ligand atoms are comparable with the B-factors for the surrounding protein atoms. Similar to FPPS, each chain adopts the all α-helical trans-prenyltransferase fold, and the monomers associate into dimers. The crystal structures of GGPS from the bacteria T. thermophilus (PDB code 1WMW), 4K. Suto, K. Nishio, Y. Nodake, K. Hamada, M. Kawamoto, N. Nakagawa, S. Kuramitu, and K. Miura, unpublished results. the Archaea P. horikoshii (PDB code 1WY0), 5M. Sugahara and N. Kunishima, unpublished results. and the yeast S. cerevisiae (27Chang T.H. Guo R.T. Ko T.P. Wang A.H. Liang P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14991-15000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) also exhibit this dimeric quaternary structure. In fact, all-trans-prenyltransferases that have previously had their x-ray structures determined are dimeric. However, in both crystal forms that we have characterized three dimers join together to form a hexamer in a 3-bladed propeller arrangement (Fig. 3A). Size-exclusion chromatography (see above) confirms that the protein is hexameric in solution. As previously seen in other trans-prenyltransferases, the monomers are composed of α-helices joined together by loop regions. Ten of these helices form a helical bundle that surrounds a central cavity where the active site is located. The N-terminal helix is perpendicular to the core helices and contributes residues that are involved in dimerization as well as hexamerization. Helices α9-α11 form a lid over the active site, and in human GGPS this region is also involved in inter-subunit interactions as discussed below. Each chain associates with its dimer partner and a monomer from each of the other two dimers (Fig. 3B). The average surface area per monomer is 13,573 Å2 with the total surface area buried by hexamer formation equal to 16,750 Å2. The largest contact area occurs at the monomer to dimer level with ∼1600 Å2 per monomer buried upon dimer formation. On average, an additional 1200 Å2 per monomer is buried upon hexamerization. To investigate whether the regions involved in inter-dimer contacts are conserved in other species, a sequence alignment of trans-prenyltransferases was performed and is shown in Fig. 4. This family of enzymes consists of α-helical proteins, and the secondary structural elements observed in human GGPS are drawn as red cylinders below the alignment and are labeled α2-α13 (Fig. 4). Regions that are involved in inter-dimer contacts in the human GGPS structure are boxed in blue and labeled A-C (Fig. 4). The following discussions concerning equivalent amino acids refer to the residue numbering for human GGPS. The inter-dimer interface between chains A and E (Fig. 3B) consists of residues from the N-terminal helix α2 (region A in Fig. 4) and loop 75-83 (region B) on chain A interacting with residues 226-254 from chain E (region C) on the adjacent dimer (Fig. 3B). At the core of this interface is a hydrophobic patch consisting of Tyr-18, Phe-76, Pro-77, Ile-82, and Tyr-83 of chain A contacting Ile-233, Ile-243, and Tyr-246 of chain E. These contacts are mirrored with Ile-233, Ile-243, and Tyr-246 of chain A interacting with Tyr-18, Phe-76, Pro-77, Ile-82, and Tyr-83 on chain D of the third dimer to form a ring-like structure. Similar interactions are observed between chains B, C, and F. These regions are largely conserved in mammalian and Drosophila GGPS but not in bacterial, archaeal, fungal, or plant GGPS or in mammalian FPPS indicating that this hexameric quaternary structure may be limited to a subset of eukaryotic GGPS, including mammalian and insect orthologs. Analysis of Ligand Pocket—The site where GGPP is bound is a ∼25-Å long channel surrounded by mainly aliphatic and aromatic side chains of residues Arg-28, Leu-31, Phe-35, His-57, Leu-122, Leu-155, Phe-156, Ala-159, Val-160, and Phe-184 (Fig. 5, A and B). This pocket is capped by charged and polar residues, including the aspartate-rich motifs on helices α4 and α8 (64DDIED68 and 188DDYAN192) that ligate the magnesium ions and the pyrophosphate moieties, and residues Arg-73, Lys-151, Gln-185, Lys-202, and Lys-212 that are also involved in phosphate binding. A similar arrangement of magnesium ions mediating the interaction between acidic side chains and phosphate groups occurs in ligand-bound FPPS structures (14Kavanagh K.L. Guo K. Dunford J.E. Wu X.

By analogy with FPPS with which GGPS shares a common fold and conserved motifs known to be involved in catalysis (Fig. 4), the reaction is proposed to proceed by an ionization-condensation-elimination mechanism (33Poulter C.D. Argyle J.C. Mash E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7227-7233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Poulter C.D. Satterwhite D.M.

The resulting carbocation intermediate is proposed to be stabilized by the accompanying negatively charged pyrophosphate and by residues in the active site, most notably Thr-152 or its equivalent (motif IV, Fig. 4). Condensation of IPP with the first carbocation intermediate results in a second positively charged intermediate, and the final product results from stereospecific elimination of a proton.

The EPR spectra of nitroxide probes at positions 133 and 146 exhibit spin coupling, indicating that these positions are proximal to an apoA-I paired counterpart on the perimeter of rHDL. fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies employing engineered apoA-I variants possessing a single tryptophan (energy donor) and/or a single cysteine (whose thiol moiety was covalently labeled with an extrinsic energy acceptor) provided evidence that paired apoA-I molecules around the perimeter of rHDL align in an extended antiparallel conformation. Taken together with the observation that the EPR spectra of nitroxide probes positioned at intervening sequence positions (134-145) do not exhibit spin coupling, this has led us to propose a “looped belt” model, wherein residues 133-146 comprise a flexible loop segment that confers to apoA-I an intrinsic ability to adapt its structure to accommodate changing particle lipid content. Specifically, in the looped belt model, with the exception of amino acids 134-145, apoA-I aligns with its counterpart in a helix 5-helix 5 registry, centered at position 139. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) plays a central role in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway; however, the structural basis for its antiatherogenic effects remains poorly understood. Here we employ EPR spectroscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer to elucidate the conformation and relative alignment of apoA-I monomers on discoidal (9.4 nm) reconstituted high density lipoprotein (rHDL).

A majority of high density lipoprotein (HDL) 2The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein(s); AEDANS, N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(1-sulfo-5-naphthyl)ethylenediamine; apoA-I, apolipoprotein(s) A-I; ABCA1, ATP-binding cassette transporter protein A-1; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; LCAT, lecithin:cholesteryl acyltransferase; MTSSL, methane thiosulfonate spin label; rHDL, reconstituted high density lipoprotein(s); SDSL, site-directed spin label. functionality is derived from the ability of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) to sequester phospholipid and cholesterol and interact with plasma enzymes and cellular receptors. During reverse cholesterol transport, HDL interacts with lecithin:cholesteryl acyltransferase (LCAT) and cellular receptors, including ATP-binding cassette transporter protein A-1 (ABCA1) and the scavenger receptor class B type I in an ordered fashion that is reflected by HDL particle lipid composition. The coordinated interaction of specific HDL subpopulations with enzymes and receptors is essential for the directed trafficking of cholesterol in reverse cholesterol transport. This process is recognized as a primary means by which HDL exerts its antiatherogenic character and participates in lipid metabolism. As a result, the plasma concentration of apoA-I is one of the best indicators of susceptibility to cardiovascular disease (1.Noma A. Yokosuka T. Kitamura K. Atherosclerosis. 1983; 49: 1-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). When combined with phospholipid vesicles, apoA-I organizes the lipid into discoidal complexes (2.Forte T. Nichols A.V. Gong E.L. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 248: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure determination of an N-terminal truncated apoA-I (5.Borhani D.W. Rogers D.P. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12291-12296Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) has led to a model of apoA-I on reconstituted HDL (rHDL) wherein apoA-I adopts an extended α helical “belt” conformation that circumscribes the perimeter of the rHDL disc (6.Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Klon A.E. Sheldahl C.J. Hellinger M. De Loof H. Harvey S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31755-31758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Whereas considerable evidence supports the “belt” model, the structural organization of apoA-I associated with rHDL remains uncertain, and alternative models of apoA-I persist. The most commonly presented model of apoA-I on rHDL is the “picket fence” conformation, wherein a series of 22 amino acid amphipathic α helices, connected by hairpin loops, align parallel to the fatty acyl chains of the phospholipids in the bilayer disc (3.Tall A.R. Small D.M. Deckelbaum R.J. Shipley G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4701-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Marcel Y.L. Kiss R.S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2003; 14: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This conformational representation of apoA-I has fallen out of favor due to the mounting evidence that apoA-I adopts an extended α helical conformation on the rHDL. Recently, Maiorano and colleagues (7.Maiorano J.N. Jandacek R.J. Horace E.M. Davidson W.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11717-11726Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) proposed that apoA-I can adopt one of two possible extended α helical conformations, including the extended belt model described above or a model wherein the apoA-I molecule loops back on itself, forming a “hairpin” structure (Fig. 1). The hairpin model was initially proposed by Tricerri et al. (8.Tricerri M.A. Behling Agree A.K. Sanchez S.A. Jonas A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14682-14691Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) data, where N- and C-terminal amino acids (residues 9 and 232, respectively) were found to be proximal. Li et al. (9.Li H.H. Lyles D.S. Pan W. Alexander E. Thomas M.J. Sorci-Thomas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39093-39101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) proposed that apoA-I adopts a belt conformation in which one apoA-I molecule aligns in variable helix registries relative to its paired counterpart on rHDL. These data are consistent with the results of Oda et al. (10.Oda M.N. Forte T.M. Ryan R.O. Voss J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), who showed that the C-terminal one-third of apoA-I adopts an extended α helix conformation on rHDL. Here we apply a combination of site-directed spin label electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (SDSL-EPR) and FRET techniques to examine the structure and relative alignment of apoA-I on discoidal rHDL. The results obtained are consistent with a model wherein paired apoA-I molecules reside on rHDL in an extended α helical conformation aligned in an antiparallel arrangement around the edge of the rHDL disc. Unique EPR spectral features reveal that a central region of the apoA-I sequence constitutes a conformationally adaptable “loop” segment. From this finding, we have formulated a looped belt model for apoA-I structure on rHDL. Production of Recombinant ApoA-I Protein—Human apoA-I was expressed in bacteria using the pNFXex bacterial expression vector as previously described (11.Ryan R.O. Forte T.M. Oda M.N. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 27: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The pNFXex plasmid was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE-3) pLysS and cultured in NZCYM medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Expressed proteins were purified via Hi-Trap nickel-chelating columns (GE Biosciences, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) as described (12.Oda M.N. Bielicki J.K. Berger T. Forte T.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1710-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Individual Cys substitutions were introduced to the apoA-I cDNA by either primer-directed PCR mutagenesis or by the Mega-Primer PCR method (13.Kammann M. Laufs J. Schell J. Gronenborn B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5404Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The mutations were verified by dideoxy automated fluorescent sequencing. Single Trp and combined single Trp/single Cys substitution variant apoA-I were produced by substituting the four endogenous Trp residues (positions 8, 50, 72, and 108) with phenylalanine to yield a Trp-deficient mutant ([email protected]Ø). A series of single Trp-bearing apoA-Is ([email protected], [email protected], [email protected], and [email protected]) were also created. In some cases, single Trp variants and [email protected]Ø apoA-I were further mutated to introduce a single Cys. The variants generated included [email protected]Ø:L170C, [email protected]Ø: A190C, [email protected]Ø:A210C, and [email protected]Ø:L230C apoA-I as well as the following single Trp variants: [email protected]:L230C, [email protected]:K133C, [email protected]:E146C, [email protected]:A210C, [email protected]:A190C, and [email protected]: A170C apoA-I. Site-directed Paramagnetic Spin Labeling—Specified Cys-substitution apoA-I variants were covalently labeled with methane thiosulfonate nitroxide spin label (MTSSL) as described earlier (10.Oda M.N. Forte T.M. Ryan R.O. Voss J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Site-directed N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(1-sulfo-5-naphthyl)ethylenediamine (AEDANS) Labeling—8 mg of a given Cys-substituted apoA-I in reducing buffer (20 mm NaPO4, 0.5 m NaCl, 3 m guanidine, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) was applied to a 1-ml Hi-Trap chelating column, preloaded with 0.1 m NiSO4.A 10-fold molar excess of AEDANS (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), with respect to apoA-I concentration, was introduced by passage onto the apoA-I-loaded Hi-Trap chelating column. Following AEDANS labeling, selected apoA-I samples were subjected to circular dichroism analysis to confirm that the secondary structure content of the molecule was unaffected by the presence of the AEDANS moiety. Preparation of rHDL—Reconstituted nascent HDL were prepared by a modified method originally described by Nichols et al. (14.Nichols A.V. Gong E.L. Blanche P.J. Forte T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 750: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 15.Nichols A.V. Gong E.L. Blanche P.J. Forte T.M. Shore V.G. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 719-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A solution of 22 mm sodium deoxycholate (in 0.5 ml) was added to an equal volume of 16.3 mm 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8. The mixture was vortexed and incubated at 37 °C until clear. 3 mg of a specified apoA-I was added to the solution (1:2 (w/w) apoA-I:2-oleoyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine), followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Sodium deoxycholate was removed by extensive dialysis against Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4. rHDL were recovered by KBr density gradient ultracentrifugation at 50,000 × g for 3 h in a Beckman Optima TLA 100.4 rotor. Fractions containing both protein and lipid were pooled and dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The size of rHDL was determined by native gradient gel electrophoresis (14.Nichols A.V. Gong E.L. Blanche P.J. Forte T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 750: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed using precast 4-20% polyacrylamide gradient gels (Invitrogen) according to Laemmli (16.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). EPR Spectroscopy—EPR measurements were carried out in a JEOL X-band spectrometer fitted with a loop-gap resonator (17.Froncisz W. Hyde J.S. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 47: 515-521Google Scholar, 18.Hubbell W.L. Froncisz W. Hyde J.S. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1987; 58: 1879-1886Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). An aliquot (10 μl) of spin-labeled lipid-free apoA-I or apoA-I rHDL at a final concentration of ∼5 mg/ml in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, was placed in a sealed quartz capillary contained in the resonator. Spectra of samples were obtained by a single 60-s scan over 100 G at a microwave power of 2 milli-watts and a modulation amplitude optimized to the natural line width (1.5-2.5 G) at room temperature (20-22 °C), as described previously (19.Chomiki N. Voss J.C. Warden C.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The accessibility of spin-labeled sites to polar (20 mm chromium oxalate) and nonpolar (O2 in equilibrium with air) relaxation agents was determined from their collisional frequency ([II]) with paramagnetic relaxers using power saturation EPR as previously described (20.Voss J. Hubbell W.L. Hernandez-Borrell J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15055-15061Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21.Altenbach C. Froncisz W. Hyde J.S. Hubbell W.L. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 1183-1191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The hydrophobicity contrast parameter was calculated from the equation, Φ= ln(IInonpolar/IIpolar). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence measurements were conducted by excitation of samples containing rHDL at 295 nm, and emission spectra were monitored between 300 and 575 nm on a PerkinElmer LS50B Luminescence Spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Scans were performed on 0.5 mg/ml protein with a 3-nm slit width and scan rate of 30 nm/min. The distance between specified donor (Trp) and acceptor (AEDANS) fluorophores was calculated as described by Selvin (22.Selvin P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 300-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). SDSL-EPR Analysis of Putative Helix Junctions in ApoA-I rHDL—A distinguishing feature of the picket fence model versus the belt and hairpin models is the presence of short loops that connect a series of 22-amino acid α helical segments (Fig. 1A), several of which are punctuated by proline residues (3.Tall A.R. Small D.M. Deckelbaum R.J. Shipley G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4701-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 3A). SDSL-EPR experiments were conducted to distinguish whether the conformation adopted by apoA-I on rHDL corresponds to a contiguous elongated α helix or a series of antiparallel α helices connected by reverse turns. The extrinsic nitroxide spin label probe, MTSSL, was introduced at specified locations in apoA-I by creating a series of single Cys substitution apoA-I variants (summarized in Table 1) and covalent attachment via the thiol side chain. Following MTSSL labeling and reconstitution into rHDL, the particles were characterized by native pore-limiting gradient PAGE (Fig. 2). The data indicate that rHDL generated with different MTSSL-labeled Cys substitution variants were indistinguishable from rHDL prepared using wild type apoA-I in terms of average particle size (∼9.4-nm diameter) and heterogeneity.TABLE 1Positions examined by EPRHelix junctionAmino acids examined1-261-67 REQLGPV2-383-91; RQEMSKDLE3-496-103; KVQPYLDD4-5116-124; RQKVEPLRA5-6139-146; EKLSPLGE6-7162-169; HLAPYSDE7-8182-190; KENGGARLA8-9204-212; SEKAKPALE9-10216-221; QGLLPV Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Native gel of rHDL complexes.

WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) EPR spectra of rHDL bearing MTSSL-labeled apoA-I, wherein the nitroxide probe was introduced at residue positions spanning amino acids 83-91 (corresponding to the helix 2-helix 3 junction (6.Segrest J.P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31755-31758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar)), are shown in Fig. 3B. The targeted sites resemble side chains attached to a backbone of fixed secondary structure (10.Oda M.N. Forte T.M. Ryan R.O. Voss J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23.Hess J.F. Budamagunta M.S. Voss J.C. Fitzgerald P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44841-44846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). With the exception of position 87 (Fig. 3B), the spectra suggest that the side chains have significant rotational freedom, consistent with surfaces sites along an α helix. Analysis of side chain dynamics and chemical accessibility of this (residues 83-91) and other putative helix junctions (Table 1) was performed to confirm the continuous α helical interpretation of EPR spectral line shapes (24.Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Because rHDL-associated apoA-I is probably oriented asymmetrically with respect to the rHDL lipid surface, variations in residue chemical accessibility will reflect the periodicity of the secondary structure. For lipid or membrane-associated proteins, the relative accessibility of the nitroxide spin label to polar and nonpolar relaxation agents provides the contrast parameter (Φ), which identifies the hydrophobicity of the side chain environment (10.Oda M.N. Forte T.M. Ryan R.O. Voss J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24.Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). When spin labels attached to sites within the 83-91 sequence of rHDL-bound apoA-I are evaluated for polarity, the amplitude of Φ is modulated at periodicity consistent with that of an α-helix (Fig. 3C). The more hydrophobic positions (Φ>-0.5) cluster to a common face of the α helix (Fig. 3D), whereas the more hydrophilic residues cluster to the opposing face of the helix. Similar EPR spectra and solvent accessibility patterns were observed at other putative interhelix regions examined, indicative of contiguous α helix secondary structure (data not shown). These results are incongruent with a model wherein rHDL-associated apoA-I is composed of a series of 22-residue length antiparallel α helices (i.e. the picket fence model). On the other hand, nitroxide probes located at residue positions from 139 to 146 (corresponding to the helix 5-helix 6 junction) did not yield EPR spectra consistent with a contiguous α helix (see below). The Central Region of ApoA-I on rHDL Forms a Loop Segment—Based on the observation that MTSSL-labeled residues located in the helix 5-helix 6 junction (residues 139-146) are not consistent with α helix, a scanning SDSL-EPR survey was performed that included all residue positions between 130 and 150. This was accomplished in a manner similar to that described above for the putative interhelix segments listed in Table 1. Among the 20 MTSSL-labeled apoA-I variant-bearing rHDL examined by EPR spectroscopy, position 139 displayed unique spectral characteristics, wherein side chain flexibility and solvent exposure implies that residue 139 occupies a distinct structural element (Fig. 4A), such as a hinge or turn. Furthermore, nitroxide moieties located at positions 133 and 146 in apoA-I exhibited broadened spectral features characteristic of magnetically coupled spins within 15 Å of one another (Fig. 4B). Spin coupling between nitroxide moieties labeled at these positions in apoA-I following incorporation into rHDL is apparent when compared with the corresponding EPR spectra of these MTSSL-labeled apoA-I in a lipid-free state. Note the degree of peak amplitude attenuation and spectral broadening upon lipid association. Given that the respective apoA-I molecules examined possess a single MTSSL moiety and the observed spin-spin interactions indicate an interspin distance of ∼15 Å, it can be concluded that apoA-I sequence positions 133 and 146 reside in a location that is proximal to the corresponding sequence position in its paired apoA-I counterpart on rHDL. In contrast to the behavior of the MTSSL probe at positions 133 and 146, spin coupling was not detected when positions 132, 145, and 147 were labeled (Fig. 4C). Partial spin coupling occurred when the probe was introduced at position 134, reflecting a greater interspin distance of ∼17-19 Å. Based on these data, it is conceivable that positions 133 and 146 define the borders of a loop segment in the conformation adopted by apoA-I in these rHDL. When these data are considered in light of models depicting the alignment and orientation of apoA-I on rHDL (Fig. 4D), we noted specific features that distinguish the belt and hairpin models. In the hairpin model, a turn near the center of the molecule results in predominantly intramolecular interactions for apoA-I monomers aligned around the edge of rHDL disc. By contrast, in the belt model, this central turn is absent, and hence, intermolecular interactions predominate between paired apoA-I around the edge of the rHDL (Fig. 4D). To differentiate between these mutually exclusive models, FRET experiments were designed to investigate the relative molecular alignment of apoA-I regions and the intra-versus intermolecular interactions between paired apoA-I in rHDL. Energy Transfer between Engineered Donor and Acceptor Fluorophores—In FRET experiments described below, Trp residues in apoA-I served as energy donor (emission maximum 330-350 nm; excitation 295 nm), whereas the extrinsic fluorescence probe, AEDANS, covalently bound to engineered Cys residues in apoA-I, served as energy acceptor (emission maximum, ∼467 nm; excitation, 336 nm). To limit the number of potential fluorescence donors in apoA-I, a series of apoA-I variants bearing only one Trp ([email protected], [email protected], [email protected], and [email protected] apoA-I, respectively) or lacking Trp altogether ([email protected]Ø apoA-I), were generated. To examine intramolecular FRET, six unique apoA-I variants were created bearing a single Trp and a single Cys substitution (Table 2). In the first experiment, the position of the energy donor (Trp) was fixed at residue 72 in apoA-I, and an AEDANS was introduced at position 210 ([email protected]:[email protected]; Fig. 5B, top). The resulting apoA-I rHDL elicited significant FRET, as judged by the fluorescence emission intensity at 470 nm upon excitation of the sample at 295 nm (Fig. 6A). By contrast, when the AEDANS moiety was located at position 133 or 146 in apoA-I, minimal fluorescence emission at 470 nm was observed, indicating that the donor and acceptor fluorophores in the label pairs ([email protected]: [email protected] and [email protected]:[email protected]) reside at a distance beyond significant FRET detection (Fig. 6A). Based on this alignment, additional dual labeled apoA-I bearing a single Trp and an AEDANS moiety were engineered, wherein the Trp and AEDANS placement were predicted to display FRET, either in the antiparallel belt or hairpin configuration (Fig. 5A). As was the case for the single Trp:single AEDANS [email protected]:[email protected] apoA-I variant, rHDL prepared using [email protected]:[email protected], [email protected]:[email protected], or [email protected]:[email protected] apoA-I displayed evidence of FRET, as seen by the intensity of the AEDANS emission peak upon excitation at 295 nm (Fig. 6A).TABLE 2ApoA-I FRET donor and acceptor label positions and combinationsAEDANSaSingle AEDANS-bearing apoA-I were used as controls for the detection of non-FRET, AEDANS excitation.TrpbSingle Trp-bearing apoA-I were used to determine parameters of Trp fluorescence at that location (i.e. quantum yield and total fluorescence).Dual labelcDual labeled apoA-I (Trp and AEDANS) were used to establish the relative alignment of apoA-I regions and R0 and R value measurements.

https://openalex.org/W2063547148,"Ecological interactions, such as predation and bioturbation, are thought to be fundamental determinants of macroevolutionary trends. A data set containing global occurrences of Phanerozoic fossils of benthic marine invertebrates shows escalatory trends in the relative frequency of ecological groups, such as carnivores and noncarnivorous infaunal or mobile organisms. Associations between these trends are either statistically insignificant or interpretable as preservational effects. Thus, there is no evidence that escalation drives macroecological trends at global and million-year time scales. We also find that taxonomic richness and occurrence data are cross-correlated, which justifies the traditional use of one as a proxy of the other."
https://openalex.org/W1861739715,"The RNA splicing endonuclease cleaves two phosphodiester bonds within folded precursor RNAs during intron removal, producing the functional RNAs required for protein synthesis. Here we describe at a resolution of 2.85 angstroms the structure of a splicing endonuclease from Archaeglobus fulgidus bound with a bulge-helix-bulge RNA containing a noncleaved and a cleaved splice site. The endonuclease dimer cooperatively recognized a flipped-out bulge base and stabilizes sharply bent bulge backbones that are poised for an in-line RNA cleavage reaction. Cooperativity arises because an arginine pair from one catalytic domain sandwiches a nucleobase within the bulge cleaved by the other catalytic domain."
https://openalex.org/W2163295499,"Ferric uptake regulator (Fur) is a global bacterial regulator that uses iron as a cofactor to bind to specific DNA sequences. Escherichia coli Fur is usually isolated as a homodimer with two metal sites per subunit. Metal binding to the iron site induces protein activation; however the exact role of the structural zinc site is still unknown. Structural studies of three different forms of the Escherichia coli Fur protein (nonactivated dimer, monomer, and truncated Fur-(1-82)) were performed. Dimerization of the oxidized monomer was followed by NMR in the presence of a reductant (dithiothreitol) and Zn(II). Reduction of the disulfide bridges causes only local structure variations, whereas zinc addition to reduced Fur induces protein dimerization. This demonstrates for the first time the essential role of zinc in the stabilization of the quaternary structure. The secondary structures of the mono- and dimeric forms are almost conserved in the N-terminal DNA-binding domain, except for the first helix, which is not present in the nonactivated dimer. In contrast, the C-terminal dimerization domain is well structured in the dimer but appears flexible in the monomer. This is also confirmed by heteronuclear Overhauser effect data. The crystal structure at 1.8Å resolution of a truncated protein (Fur-(1-82)) is described and found to be identical to the N-terminal domain in the monomeric and in the metal-activated state. Altogether, these data allow us to propose an activation mechanism for E. coli Fur involving the folding/unfolding of the N-terminal helix.

Iron is an essential element for almost all living organisms. However, the Fe(III) form is highly insoluble, and an excess of Fe(II) is toxic for the cell because of the formation of highly reactive radicals via the Fenton reaction. This is why the intracellular iron concentration has to be tightly regulated. In Gram-negative bacteria, the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) 3The abbreviations used are: Fur, ferric uptake regulator; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbidiimide; ZnSFurD, dimeric Fur protein containing zinc in the structural metal site; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; DTT, dithiothreitol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; het-NOE, heteronuclear NOE. protein plays the key role in regulating iron homeostasis. Escherichia coli Fur is a global transcriptional regulator that controls the expression of more than 90 genes mainly implicated in iron uptake but also in other fundamental processes, such as the regulation of oxidative stress, acid tolerance, and bacterial virulence determinants (1Hantke K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). E. coli Fur is mainly described as a dimeric protein containing two metal-binding sites per subunit. Binding of a divalent cation (ferrous iron in vivo) to the regulatory site enables the protein to bind to a specific DNA sequence in the promoter region of iron-regulated genes, the Fur box (2de Lorenzo V. Wee S. Herrero M. Neilands J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2624-2630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus repressing gene transcription. In the regulatory site, the ferrous iron can be replaced by other divalent metal ions, such as Mn(II), Co(II), Zn(II), and Ni(II) (2de Lorenzo V. Wee S. Herrero M. Neilands J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2624-2630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bagg A. Neilands J.B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5471-5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 4Ochsner U.A. Vasil A.I. Vasil M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 7194-7201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous spectroscopic data (EPR, Mössbauer, and x-ray absorption) indicated that this site forms an axially distorted octahedral environment (5Adrait A. Jacquamet L. Le Pape L. Gonzalez de Peredo A. Aberdam D. Hazemann J.L. Latour J.M. Michaud-Soret I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6248-6260Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 6Jacquamet L. Dole F. Jeandey C. Oddou J.L.

A second metal site was identified in the 1990s in the E. coli Fur protein, which binds Zn(II) with a very high affinity (7Jacquamet L. Aberdam D. Adrait A. Hazemann J.L. Latour J.M. Michaud-Soret I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2564-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 8Althaus E.W. Outten C.E. Olson K.E. Cao H. O'Halloran T.V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6559-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Extended x-ray absorption fine structure studies showed that this zinc ion is coordinated by two cysteines together with one carboxylate and one histidine or two carboxylates (7Jacquamet L. Aberdam D. Adrait A. Hazemann J.L. Latour J.M. Michaud-Soret I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2564-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The two cysteines, Cys92 and Cys95, have been identified as ligands of the zinc atom using chemical modification and mass spectrometry (9Gonzalez de Peredo A. Saint-Pierre C. Adrait A. Jacquamet L. Latour J.M. Forest E. Michaud-Soret I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8582-8589Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This confirmed the importance of these two cysteines that have been shown to be essential to the E. coli Fur activity by site-directed mutagenesis (10Coy M. Doyle C. Besser J. Neilands J.B. Biometals. 1994; 7: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These cysteines are conserved in a large number of Fur proteins, but only one is conserved in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Fur. Although the zinc site probably plays a structural role, to date no clear function of this zinc site was elucidated. The only three-dimensional structure of a Fur protein described to date is the metal-activated form of the P. aeruginosa Fur (11Pohl E. Haller J.C. Mijovilovich A. Meyer-Klaucke W. Garman E. Vasil M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The protein was crystallized in the presence of Zn(II) ions. Four metal ions were observed per monomer, two of them were bound to conserved ligands and were therefore proposed to occupy the two characterized relevant sites. From the metal-site geometry in the presence of zinc and after its substitution by iron in the regulatory site, the regulatory and the structural site could be identified (11Pohl E. Haller J.C. Mijovilovich A. Meyer-Klaucke W. Garman E. Vasil M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In the regulatory site, the zinc ion is hexacoordinated in an octahedral geometry, with a water molecule occupying one of these positions. The structural zinc-binding site contains a zinc ion in a tetrahedral geometry bound to two glutamic acids (Glu80 and Glu100) and two histidines (His32 and His89) and is therefore different from the one in E. coli Fur. It is noteworthy that the single cysteine residue of P. aeruginosa Fur was shown to be dispensable for the in vivo activity of P. aeruginosa Fur by site-directed mutagenesis (12Lewin A.C. Doughty P.A. Flegg L. Moore G.R. Spiro S. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2449-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because most Fur proteins contain the conserved cysteines found to be bound to the structural zinc in the E. coli protein, it seems essential to study the structural properties of the biochemically well characterized E. coli Fur. In addition, no structural information is available on the nonactivated form of Fur. Here we describe for the first time the structural properties of the nonactivated dimeric E. coli Fur (named ZnSFurD for dimeric Fur protein containing zinc in the structural metal site) by using NMR spectroscopy. In addition, we also studied the so far uncharacterized monomeric form (13Michaud-Soret I. Adrait A. Jaquinod M. Forest E. Touati D. Latour J.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 473-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and its conversion to dimer. Finally, a truncated protein comprising the first 82 amino acids, corresponding to the DNA binding domain, has been characterized by NMR and x-ray crystallography. Comparison of the different Fur forms yields essential information on the structural reorganization of this important E. coli global regulator during dimerization and activation processes. Protein Sample Preparation—Protein purification was performed at 4 °C and centrifugation at 6 °C. Native E. coli Fur was purified to homogeneity according to the published procedure (14D'Autréaux B. Touati D. Bersch B. Latour J.M. Michaud-Soret I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16619-16624Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A higher yield in monomeric Fur can be obtained by increasing the EDTA concentration in the extraction buffer to 100 mm. The different oligomeric states of Fur were separated by gel filtration (Superdex 75 16/60 HR; Amersham Biosciences) in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, 0.1 m KCl, pH 8 (4 °C). 10% v/v glycerol was added before protein concentration and storage. Dimer/monomer fractions were pooled separately and concentrated to a final volume of 1 ml by using an ultrafiltration support (Ultrafree 5K, Millipore). Protein concentrations, consistently expressed in subunit concentration unless indicated otherwise, were determined spectrophotometrically by using an absorption coefficient of 0.4 mg-1 ml-1 cm-1 at 275 nm for one monomer of native Fur (15Wee S. Neilands J.B. Bittner M.L. Hemming B.C. Haymore B.L. Seetharam R. Biometals. 1988; 1: 62-68Google Scholar). The Fur-(1-82) mutant was generated by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene with the two synthetic oligonucleotide primers 5′-CCGTATTTGAACTGACATAGCAACATCACCACGATC-3′ and 5′-GATCGTGGTGATGTTGCTATGTCAGTTCAAATACGG-3′ and the methylated plasmid pET30c-FUR containing the wild-type protein (14D'Autréaux B. Touati D. Bersch B. Latour J.M. Michaud-Soret I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16619-16624Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Genome Express, France). Freshly transformed BL21(DE3) competent cells were plated on LB (0.1% agar) containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and were grown at 37 °C. Cells were grown at 37 °C from an overnight culture in 1 liter of LB containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Fur-(1-82) expression was induced at A600 nm = 0.7-0.8 by isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside at a final concentration of 0.5 mm for 3 h. Cells were harvested at 5000 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was suspended in 30 ml of 0.1 m MOPS, pH 8, 0.1 m EDTA, 10% w/v sucrose, 10% glycerol (v/v) containing 10 mg/ml trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 4 μg/ml pepstatin A (all from Sigma). Cells were disrupted by sonication, and the supernatant obtained from centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min was treated with 1% w/v streptomycin sulfate (Sigma). The suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 35,000 × g. The first step of protein purification consisted of an ammonium sulfate precipitation to 50% of saturation for 3 h followed by centrifugation for 30 min at 25,000 × g, the supernatant was brought to 77% ammonium sulfate saturation, and proteins were precipitated under stirring overnight before centrifugation. The precipitate was redissolved in 5 ml of 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8, containing 10% glycerol (v/v). Homogeneous Fur-(1-82) was obtained after a gel filtration on a Superdex 75 HR 16/60 (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m KCl. Pure protein fractions, as revealed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry, were pooled and concentrated with Ultrafree (5K Millipore). Protein concentration was determined with the BCA assay (Bio-Rad) using a FUR and a bovine serum albumin calibration curve. The yield was 30 mg of pure protein per liter of bacterial culture. Crystallization Conditions and Structure Determination of the Truncated Fur-(1-82)—Screening of the crystallization conditions was initially performed with a TECAN robot at the Institut of Structural Biology using various commercial screens from Hampton Research and Qiagen. Crystals were obtained at 20 °C in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 30% (v/v) PEG 400 containing 100 mm CdCl2 (classic suite from Qiagen). Crystallization conditions were then optimized, and finally, crystals were grown at 20 °C from a 1:1 μl mixture of 10 mg/ml protein solution with 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 30% (v/v) PEG 200 containing 100 mm CdCl2. For data collection, the crystals were transferred into a solution composed of the mother liquor containing 25% glycerol as cryoprotectant. X-ray crystallography was then used to obtain the three-dimensional structure of Fur-(1-82) at high resolution. The final data set was collected at 1.8 Å resolution on beamline FIP-BM30A at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France (16Roth M. Carpentier P. Kaïkati O. Joly J. Charrault P. Pirocchi M. Kahn R. Fanchon E. Jacquamet L. Borel F. Bertoni A. Israel-Gouy P. Ferrer J.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Data reduction was performed using the XDS program (17Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3232) Google Scholar). The space group was P21212(a = 38.50 Å, b = 159.27 Å, c = 28.65 Å) with potentially two molecules per asymmetric unit (solvent content of 48%). The structure was solved by molecular replacement performed with the Phaser program (18Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) using the model of the first 84 amino acids of the P. aeruginosa protein (Protein Data Bank code 1MZB). The first model obtained with Phaser was then introduced in ARP-WARP (19Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) with the E. coli Fur sequence. ARP_WARP built 139 amino acids over the 164 present in the asymmetric unit, and the remaining amino acids have been incorporated with the coot program (20Emsley P. Cowtan K.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23377) Google Scholar). Refinements of the different models were carried out with the Refmac5 program of the CCP4 Suite (21Collaborative Computational ProjectActa Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19768) Google Scholar) in the 30-1.8 Å resolution range without any NCS restraints. The atomic coordinates and structure factors for N-terminal domain of Fur have been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank under the accession number 2FU4. NMR Sample Preparation—Uniformly labeled 13C/2H/15N- and 13C/15N/-Fur was obtained by overexpression in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Bacteria freshly transformed with pET-30-Fur were grown at 37 °C in M9 minimal medium containing 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl and 2 g/liter [13C]glucose with or without ≈95% D2O and supplemented with MnCl2 (0.1 mm), ZnSO4 (0.05 mm), FeCl3 (0.05 mm), and a vitamin solution (22Jansson M. Li Y.C. Jendeberg L. Anderson S. Montelione B.T. Nilsson B. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 7: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). 15N-Fur-(1-82) was obtained using the same procedure with minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl. For deuterated Fur, 20 ml of LB medium prepared with 50% D2O were inoculated with a colony of freshly transformed bacteria, and cells were grown at 37 °C to saturation overnight. Bacteria were harvested at 1500 × g, washed twice with 20 ml of cold M9 medium, and resuspended in a final volume of 100 ml of 13C/15N-labeled M9 medium prepared with ≈95% D2O. Growth occurred overnight at 37 °C. Cells were harvested at 1500 × g and resuspended in 1 liter of 13C/15N-labeled M9 medium in ≈95% D2O. The culture was incubated at 37 °C. Expression of the Fur protein was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside when the A600 nm reached a value of 0.5. Cells were kept at 37 °C for 5 h and were finally harvested and stored frozen at -80 °C until protein purification. An additional NMR sample of highly deuterated Fur was also prepared using a commercial triple-labeled medium (OD2 medium from Silantes, Germany). After two 10-ml precultures in LB medium prepared with 100% D2O, 40 ml of triple-labeled OD2 medium were inoculated with 400 μl of cell suspension and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cells were harvested at 1500 × g and resuspended in 920 ml of Silantes OD2 medium. Protein expression was induced by isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (final concentration of 0.5 mm) at 37°C at an A600 nm of 0.8 for 5 h before harvesting the cells. For the NMR experiments, the buffer was exchanged to 0.1 m MOPS/NaOH, 0.5 m KCl, pH 7.5, using NAP10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). 7% D2O and either DTT (10 mm, Fur dimer) or EDTA (20 mm, Fur monomer) were added to the sample after the buffer exchange step. The high KCl concentration employed was necessary to prevent protein oligomerization at high concentrations. 4B. D'Autréaux, L. Pecqueur, R. E. M. Diederix, S. Gonzalez de Peredo, C. CauxThang, L. Tabet, B. Bersch, E. Forest, and I. Michaud-Soret, submitted for publication. NMR sample concentrations varied between 1.5 and 2.5 mm. All NMR samples were prepared in a glove box under argon and sealed in the NMR tubes. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were performed at 298 K on VARIAN INOVA 600 and 800 spectrometers equipped with triple resonance (13C, 1H, 15N) probes including shielded z-gradients. The data were processed using Felix 2000 (Accelrys), and the resonance assignment was achieved using the ALPS program (24Morelle N. Simorre J.P. Caffrey M. Meyer T. Cusanovich M. Marion D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HN(COCA)CB, and HN(CA)CB pulse sequences were provided by the Varian protein pack. The three-dimensional MQ-HNCOCA (25Brutscher B. Cordier F. Simorre J.P. Caffrey M. Marion D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and the three-dimensional MQ-COHNCA (26Szyperski T. Braun D. Fernandez C. Bartels C. Wüthrich K. J. Magn. Reson. 1995; 108: 197-203Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) were performed as described in the literature. The secondary structure elements were identified from secondary 13C′ and 13C-α chemical shifts (27Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar). In the case of the dimeric protein, two NOESY experiments were recorded at 600 MHz to deduce the topology of the β-strands as follows: a 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC with a mixing time of 140 ms, and a 15N-HSQC-NOE-15N-HSQC with a mixing time of 50 ms. Both experiments were performed on the highly deuterated Fur sample. For the side chain assignment of the dimeric protein, (H)C(CO)NH-TOCSY and H(CCO)NH-TOCSY experiments were acquired at 600 MHz as well as (H)CCH-TOCSY and H(C)CH-TOCSY experiments at 800 MHz (pulse sequences provided by the Varian Protein Pack). {1H}-15N NOE were measured at 600 MHz using a standard two-dimensional pulse sequence (28Farrow N.A. Zhang O. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Two spectra with on and off resonance 1H saturation were recorded in an interleaved manner. The saturation time and the recycle delay were set to 4 and 7 s, respectively. Only well resolved peaks were taken into account for the intensity measurements. Resonance assignments for ZnSFurD and monomeric Fur have been deposited with the BMRB databank under the accession numbers 6947 and 6948, respectively. Zinc Titration of Monomeric Fur—20 m eq of DTT were added to a solution of 0.8 mm monomeric 15N-labeled Fur in 0.1 m MOPS/NaOH, 0.5 m KCl, pH 7.5. Up to 1.5 m eq/monomer of ZnSO4 dissolved in water was then added drop by drop by steps of 0.5 m eq to the sample in an NMR tube before recording 1H,15N-HSQC spectra. E. coli Fur exists in solution under several oligomeric states (29D'Autréaux B. Etudes Spectroscopiques de la Protéine FUR (Ferric Uptake Regulation). Interaction avec le Monxyde d'Axote.

Forest, and I. Michaud-Soret, submitted for publication. Monomeric and dimeric species were purified separately because they are not in equilibrium (13Michaud-Soret I. Adrait A. Jaquinod M. Forest E.

CauxThang, L. Tabet, B. Bersch, E. Forest, and I. Michaud-Soret, submitted for publication. The E. coli Fur monomer contains the four cysteines oxidized in two disulfide bridges Cys92-Cys95 and Cys132-Cys137 (29D'Autréaux B. Etudes Spectroscopiques de la Protéine FUR (Ferric Uptake Regulation). Interaction avec le Monxyde d'Axote. Doctoral dissertation. Université J. Fourier, Grenoble, France2002Google Scholar). 4B. D'Autréaux, L. Pecqueur, R. E. M. Diederix, S. Gonzalez de Peredo, C. CauxThang, L. Tabet, B. Bersch, E. Forest, and I. Michaud-Soret, submitted for publication. Here we describe the structural properties of the dimeric and monomeric forms using NMR and x-ray crystallography, and we investigate the structural changes related to the monomer-dimer conversion. The 1H,15N-HSQC spectra of the two forms are shown in Fig. 1. The spectrum of the dimeric protein shows ∼150 peaks, from which it can be concluded that ZnSFurD forms a symmetric dimer, in agreement with the P. aeruginosa crystal structure (11Pohl E. Haller J.C. Mijovilovich A. Meyer-Klaucke W. Garman E. Vasil M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Even if we consider a variation of the chemical environment for residues at the dimer interface, the spectra obtained for the monomer and the dimer are too different for the two species to expect the same three-dimensional structure. In particular, it can be seen that the spectrum of the monomeric protein is less extended both in the proton and in the nitrogen dimension, indicating a lower degree of structuralization of the monomer compared with the dimer. However, under our NMR experimental conditions, Fur dimer, prepared in the absence of DTT and without strictly respecting anaerobic conditions, slowly and irreversibly formed some monomeric species. To avoid formation of the monomer, DTT was added to the Fur dimer samples to maintain the cysteines in their reduced form. Furthermore, to avoid formation of oligomeric Fur in the NMR dimer samples, they were prepared in 0.5 m KCl, pH 7.5. The monomeric sample appears stable with time and only shows some proteolytic degradation after several days at room temperature. NMR Characterization of Nonactivated Fur Dimer (ZnSFurD)—Using standard three-dimensional NMR experiments, 91% of the backbone resonances could rapidly be assigned. No resonance assignments could be obtained for the five N-terminal residues as well as Val67, Gly74, His86, His87, Asp104, Ser105, and Lys116 residues. The secondary chemical shifts derived from the difference between the experimental chemical shift and the one corresponding to a random coil conformation for a specified amino acid indicate the presence of four α-helices (residues 18-24, 35-44, 51-62, and 106-114) and five β-strands (residues 66-71, 77-82, 88-91, 97-102, and 119-131), which are detailed in Fig. 2A. The first three helices and the subsequent two β-strands belong to the winged helixturn-helix motif required for DNA interaction (30Gonzalez de Peredo A. Saint-Pierre C. Latour J.M. Michaud-Soret I. Forest E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the crystal structure of P. aeruginosa Fur contains an additional N-terminal helix (11Pohl E. Haller J.C. Mijovilovich A. Meyer-Klaucke W. Garman E. Vasil M.L. Mol.

This allowed us to deduce the topology of the β-sheets; strands β1 and β2 as well as β3 and β4 form two short antiparallel sheets, and the NOEs observed in the last strand can only be explained by the presence of an antiparallel inter-subunit β-sheet at the dimer interface. These observations are in good accordance with the crystal structure of the Zn(II)-activated P. aeruginosa Fur protein (11Pohl E. Haller J.C. Mijovilovich A. Meyer-Klaucke W. Garman E. Vasil M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), with the exception of the N-terminal helix preceding the winged helix-turn-helix motif. Unfortunately, further structural investigations of the protein by NMR were made impossible by the very unfavorable relaxation properties of this protein. The difficulty of the NMR study of Fur was already described in the literature (31Saito T. Duly D. Williams R.P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 32Saito T. Williams R.P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 33Saito T. Wormald M.R. Williams R.P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Only about 40% of the side chain resonances could confidently be assigned. Attempts to obtain additional structural information from 13C-edited NOESY spectra failed. 15N relaxation measurements revealed that the ratio of transversal and longitudinal relaxation rates was much higher than expected from the molecular mass of 34 kDa (results not shown), and we suppose that under our experimental conditions there is still some amount of oligomeric protein formed in the sample during data acquisition. NMR Characterization of Fur Monomer—In case of the monomeric Fur, the backbone resonance assignment could be achieved easily for the N-terminal domain. Four α-helices (residues 5-9, 17-24, 35-44, and 51-63) and two β-strands (residues 67-71 and 76-80) were deduced from the analysis of the secondary chemical shift values (Fig. 2B). The C-terminal domain (residues 81-147) was difficult to assign, and 26 residues of 67 could not be identified. Moreover, 16 peaks were missing in the 1H,15N-HSQC, indicating that the monomer probably undergoes conformational exchange. The secondary chemical shifts do not indicate any well defined secondary structure elements in the C-terminal domain, which is known to be involved in the dimer interface. Compared with ZnSFurD, the N-terminal domain has globally the same secondary structure except for the first residues, for which the secondary chemical shifts reveal the presence of an additional α-helix (residues 5-9), situated N-terminal to the helix-turn-helix motif, analogous to the one seen in the P. aeruginosa protein. Comparison of Monomeric and Dimeric Species—The comparison of the backbone chemical shifts between monomer and dimer is shown in Fig. 2E. It can be seen that there are no deviations or only very weak deviations in the region corresponding to the helix-turn-helix motif (residues 14-65), suggesting that the local structure of this part of the protein is not influenced by the dimerization. On the other hand, there are significant differences for the C-terminal half and for the 18 N-terminal residues, regions for which the analysis of the secondary chemical shift has already indicated very different structural behavior (see Fig. 2, A and B). To confirm the structural flexibility of the C-terminal domain in the monomeric species and to obtain further information on the intriguing changes in secondary structure in the N-terminal part between mono- and dimer, {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE (het-NOE"

https://openalex.org/W1999726178,"To determine the specific role lipids play in membrane protein topogenesis in vivo, the orientation with respect to the membrane bilayer of Escherichia coli lactose permease (LacY) transmembrane (TM) domains and their flanking extramembrane domains was compared after assembly in native membranes and membranes with genetically modified lipid content using the substituted cysteine accessibility method for determining TM domain mapping. LacY assembled in the absence of the major membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) does not carry out uphill transport of substrate and displays an inverted orientation for the N-terminal six-TM domain helical bundle (Bogdanov, M., Heacock, P. N., and Dowhan, W. (2002) EMBO J. 21, 2107-2116). Strikingly, the replacement of PE in vivo by the foreign lipid monoglucosyldiacylglycerol (MGlcDAG), synthesized by the Acholeplasma laidlawii MGlcDAG synthase, restored uphill transport and supported the wild type TM topology of the N-terminal helical bundle of LacY. An interchangeable role in defining membrane protein TM domain orientation and supporting function is played by the two most abundant lipids, PE and MGlcDAG, in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, respectively. Therefore, these structurally diverse lipids endow the membrane with similar properties necessary for the proper organization of protein domains in LacY that are highly sensitive to lipids as topological determinants."

Protein O-mannosylation is catalyzed by protein O-mannosyltransferase 1 (POMT1) and its homologue, POMT2. Coexpression of POMT1 and POMT2 is required to show O-mannosylation activity. Here we have shown that POMT1 forms a complex with POMT2 and the complex possesses protein O-mannosyltransferase activity. Results indicate that POMT1 and POMT2 associate physically and functionally in vivo. Recently, three mutations were reported in the POMT1 gene of patients who showed milder phenotypes than typical Walker-Warburg syndrome. We coexpressed these mutant POMT1s with POMT2 and found that none of them had any activity. However, all POMT1 mutants, including previously identified POMT1 mutants, coprecipitated with POMT2.

We have also found that muscle-eye-brain disease (OMIM 253280), a congenital muscular dystrophy, was caused by mutations in the gene encoding POMGnT1 (protein O-mannose β1,2-N-acetyl-glucosaminyltransferase 1), which forms a GlcNAcβ1-2Man linkage of O-mannosyl glycans (4Yoshida A.

These findings suggested that these mutations would not completely abolish enzymatic activity, which prompted us to examine POMT activities of mutated POMT1 with milder phenotypes. PMT, protein O-mannosyltransferase, is evolutionarily conserved from prokaryotes, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, to eukaryotes, such as yeast, Drosophila, mouse, and human (16Strahl-Bolsinger S.

In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, O-mannosylation is required for the stability, correct localization, and/or function of proteins. Yeast O-mannosylation is initiated in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by a family of PMTs that catalyze the transfer of a mannosyl residue from dolichol phosphate mannose to Ser/Thr residues of proteins (16Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae has seven PMT homologues (Pmt1p-7p) that share almost identical hydropathy profiles.

The PMT family is classified phylogenetically into the PMT1, PMT2, and PMT4 subfamilies. Members of the PMT1 subfamily (Pmt1p and Pmt5p) interact heterophilically with those of the PMT2 subfamily (Pmt2p and Pmt3p), whereas the single member of the PMT4 subfamily (Pmt4p) acts as a homophilic complex (17Girrbach V.

Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although Pmt1p-4p and Pmt6p have O-mannosyltransferase activity by themselves (23Gentzsch M. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Tanner W. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), complex formation is essential for maximal transferase activity of yeast PMT family members (17Girrbach V. Strahl S. J. Biol.

In human, transferase activity may also require formation of a heterocomplex of POMT1 and POMT2, because cotransfection of POMT1 and POMT2 up-regulates POMT activity in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells whereas expression of only one of these proteins does not (6Manya H.

However, no direct evidence for a physical interaction between POMT1 and POMT2 proteins has been obtained so far. Here, we have demonstrated that POMT1 and POMT2 form a functional complex in vivo using immunoprecipitating techniques. Furthermore, we showed that the mutations of POMT1 protein found in WWS patients do not prevent complex formation with POMT2 but they do abolish activity of the complex. Vector Construction of POMT1 Mutants and POMT2—Human POMT1 cDNA was used for site-directed mutagenesis and was cloned into pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen) as described previously (6Manya H. Chiba A.

For each of the three mutations (G65R, A200P, M582C) examined in this study, the POMT1 gene was modified with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions as described previously (10Akasaka-Manya K.

All mutant clones were sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutations. Other mutants (G76R, L421del, V428D) and human POMT2 cDNA were obtained as described previously (10Akasaka-Manya K. Manya H.

Cell Solubilization—HEK293T cells or transfected HEK293T cells were homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol with protease inhibitor mixture (3 μg/ml of pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation at 900 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay. Microsomal fractions thus obtained were solubilized with buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA) containing detergents at different concentrations at 4 °C. The solubilized microsomal membrane fractions thus obtained were subjected to POMT activity assay and Western blot analysis. Expression of POMT1 with POMT2—Expression plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C to produce POMT1 and POMT2 proteins. Immunocytochemical Analysis—The expression vectors encoding Myc-tagged POMT1 and FLAG-tagged POMT2 were transfected into the HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine Plus reagent. Transfected HEK293T cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated culture slides (BD Biosciences), fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min, and then permeabilized with cold methanol. After treatment with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature for 1 h, cells were incubated with anti-FLAG, anti-Myc (9E10), and anti-calreticulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for overnight at 4 °C. Next, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature. After a final wash with PBS, cells were observed, using fluorescence microscopy. We also used the following fluorescent primary antibodies: fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-FLAG (Sigma) and TRITC-conjugated anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitation—Microsomal fractions were lysed with assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% n-octyl-β-d-thioglucoside) in a final concentration of 2 mg/ml for 5 h at 4°C. After solubilization, proteins were subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min and precleaned with CL-6B-Sepharose (Sigma). Precleaned supernatants were mixed with anti-Myc (9E10)-agarose conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubated overnight. After three washes with the assay buffer, the agarose beads were suspended in sample buffer. Samples were subjected to Western blot analysis. To assay POMT activity, the precipitated beads were suspended in 60 μl of assay buffer and used as the enzyme source. Western Blot Analysis—The microsomal fractions (20 μg) or immunoprecipitated samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% gel), and proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked in PBS containing 5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20, incubated with anti-POMT1 or anti-POMT2 polyclonal antibody (6Manya H. Chiba A. Yoshida A. Wang X. Chiba Y. Jigami Y.

Each antibody is specific for the respective recombinant protein; that is, they do not cross-react with each other. Assay for POMT Activity—POMT activity was based on the amount of mannose transferred from dolichol phosphate mannose to a glutathione S-transferase fusion α-DG (GST-αDG) as described previously (6Manya H. Chiba A. Yoshida A. Wang X. Chiba Y. Jigami Y. Margolis R.U. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Briefly, assays were carried out in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 nm 3H-labeled dolichol phosphate mannose (Dol-P-[3H]Man, 125,000 dpm/pmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO), 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% n-octyl-β-d-thioglucoside, 10 μg of GST-α-DG, and 80 μg of microsomal membrane fraction. Microsomal fractions were solubilized with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% n-octyl-β-d-thioglucoside for 1 h, and the reaction was initiated by adding Dol-P-[3H]Man. After a 1-h incubation at 25 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 150 μl of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, and the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, mixed with 400 μl of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare), rotated at 4 °C for 1 h, and washed three times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The radioactivity adsorbed to the beads was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. Colocalization of POMT1 and POMT2 in the ER—To determine the subcellular localization of POMT1 and POMT2, HEK293T cells were transfected with expression constructs encoding each protein. Anti-POMT1 and anti-POMT2 antibodies did not stain untransfected HEK293T cells (data not shown), suggesting that HEK293T cells express little POMT1 and POMT2. Myc-tagged POMT1 colocalized precisely with anti-calreticulin (ER marker). Calreticulin staining localized around the nuclei and overlapped with POMT1-Myc staining (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, FLAG-tagged POMT2 also colocalized with calreticulin (Fig. 1B), in agreement with a previous finding that POMT2 localized to the ER membrane (25Willer T. Amselgruber W. Deutzmann R. Strahl S. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Double staining of HEK293T cells by both POMT1 and POMT2 demonstrated their colocalization (Fig. 1C). Thus, we concluded that POMT1 and POMT2 reside in the ER. Solubilization of POMT Activity—Colocalization of POMT1 and POMT2 in the ER and the requirement of coexpression of both components for protein O-mannosylation (6Manya H. Chiba A. Yoshida A. Wang X. Chiba Y. Jigami Y. Margolis R.U. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) suggest that POMT1-POMT2 complex formation is necessary for POMT activity. To obtain physical evidence for complex formation between POMT1 and POMT2, we solubilized membrane proteins with various detergents and attempted to detect a complex by immunoprecipitation. In yeast, members of the PMT1 family were found to form heteromeric complexes with members of the PMT2 subfamily in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation experiments after solubilization of membrane proteins with 0.35% sodium deoxycholate and 0.5% Triton X-100 (17Girrbach V. Strahl S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12554-12562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Human POMT activity could not be detected when Triton X-100 was used as a detergent, but it could be detected when n-octyl-β-d-thioglucoside was used as the detergent (6Manya H. Chiba A. Yoshida A. Wang X. Chiba Y. Jigami Y. Margolis R.U. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Therefore, at first we examined the effect of various detergents on POMT activity of HEK293T cells, in addition to Triton X-100 and n-octyl-β-d-thioglucoside. n-Octyl-β-d-thioglucoside at a concentration of 0.5% was found to be most effective under our assay conditions (Fig. 2). Then we tried to solubilize POMT activity under various incubation temperatures, incubation times, and detergent concentrations. We found that the optimal conditions for solubilizing POMT activity from the microsomal membrane were 0.5% n-octyl-β-d-thioglucoside at 4 °C for 5 h. Coimmunoprecipitation of POMT1 and POMT2—To determine whether POMT1 and POMT2 form a heterocomplex, POMT1-Myc and POMT2 were cotransfected into HEK293T cells (Fig. 3, A-C). Microsomal membrane fractions of these cells were lysed with 0.5% n-octyl-β-d-thioglucoside at 4 °C for 5 h and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc (9E10) antibody-conjugated agarose. A Western blot analysis of precipitates revealed that POMT1-Myc and POMT2 were coimmunoprecipitated (Fig. 3, D and E, lanes 1), indicating that POMT1 and POMT2 form a complex. We then confirmed that POMT2 does not bind to anti-Myc-agarose nonspecifically. Cells that were transfected with only POMT2 were solubilized by n-octyl-β-d-thioglucoside and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc-agarose. In this case, POMT2 was not detected in the precipitates, indicating POMT2 did not bind to anti-Myc-agarose (Fig. 3, D and E, lanes 3). On the other hand, when POMT1-Myc and POMT2 were separately expressed in different cells and then solubilized, mixed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc-agarose, no complex formation between POMT1-Myc and POMT2 was detected (Fig. 3, D and E, lanes 5). These results indicated that the POMT1 and POMT2 proteins could not associate with each other when they are expressed separately and suggest that assembly of POMT1 and POMT2 occurs in the ER membrane. Next, we examined whether the coprecipitated POMT1-POMT2 complex has POMT activity. Distinct activity was detected in the precipitates from POMT1-Myc-POMT2 cotransfected cells (Fig. 3F, lane 1). The precipitates from cell membranes expressing only POMT1-Myc had slight POMT activity (Fig. 3F, lane 2). This weak activity may be due to complex formation between transfected POMT1-Myc and endogenous POMT2. The POMT activity in a mixture of individually expressed POMT1-Myc and POMT2 was similar to the background level (Fig. 3F, lane 5). Based on these results, we concluded that POMT1 and POMT2 associate physically in vivo and that this state becomes functional. Effect of Mutations on POMT Activity—Recently, three mutations (G65R, A200P, and W582C) in the POMT1 gene were found (Table 1) (11Currier S.C. Lee C.K. Chang B.S. Bodell A.L. Pai G.S. Job L.

Because these patients have milder phenotypes than typical WWS patients, we expected the mutated POMT1s to have some POMT activity. To test this hypothesis, these mutations were introduced into POMT1-myc cDNA and cotransfected into HEK293T cells with POMT2 (Fig. 4, A-C). However, none of the POMT1 mutants, like the other mutants (10Akasaka-Manya K. Manya H. Endo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), showed any POMT activity (Fig. 4D).TABLE 1Summary of mutations in the POMT1 gene of WWS patientsMutationsEffectsG193AGly65 → Arg missense (G65R)G598CAla200 → Pro missense (A200P)G1746CTrp582 → Cys missense (W582C)C226AGly76 → Arg missense (G76R)1260 to 1262 del CCTLeu421 deletion (L421del)T1283AVal428 → Asp missense (V428D) Open table in a new tab Immunoprecipitation of Mutant POMT1 and POMT2— Eight mutations in the POMT1 gene of patients with WWS (G76R, L421del, V428D, G65R, A200P, W582C, V703fs, and G722fs) were found to abolish POMT activity in both the present and previous studies (10Akasaka-Manya K. Manya H. Endo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We examined six of these mutant POMT1s (all but the latter two) to determine whether they prevented complex formation with POMT2 (Table 1). The mutated POMT1-mycs were cotransfected into HEK293T cells with POMT2. POMT2 was found to precipitate with each of the POMT1 mutants (Fig. 5, A and B), indicating that these mutations did not affect complex formation with POMT2. Protein O-mannosylation is an essential post-translational modification (19Endo T. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 21: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In yeast and fungi, protein O-mannosylation is indispensable for cell wall integrity and normal cellular morphogenesis (16Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, a defect of O-mannosylation causes a rotation of the abdomen due to abnormal muscle development (26Martin-Blanco E. Garcia-Bellido A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6048-6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27Ichimiya T. Manya H. Ohmae Y. Yoshida H. Takahashi K. Ueda R. Endo T. Nishihara S. J. Biol.

Falcon-Perez J.M. Renner-Muller I. Przemeck G.K. Lommel M. Coloma A. Valero M.C. de Angelis M.H. Tanner W. Wolf E. Strahl S. Cruces J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In human, impairment of α-DG O-mannosylation leads to congenital muscular dystrophy and neuronal migration disorders, WWS (7Beltran-Valero de Bernabe D. Currier S. Steinbrecher A. Celli J. van Beusekom E. van der Zwaag B. Kayserili H. Merlini L. Chitayat D. Dobyns W.B. Cormand B. Lehesjoki A.E. Cruces J. Voit T. Walsh C.A. van Bokhoven H. Brunner H.G. Am. J. Hum.

Commun. 2004; 325: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Protein O-mannosylation requires at least two components, POMT1 and POMT2 (6Manya H. Chiba A. Yoshida A. Wang X. Chiba Y. Jigami Y. Margolis R.U. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The present results have shown that POMT1 and POMT2 form a heterocomplex in vivo. The immunoprecipitated complex of POMT1 and POMT2 possessed POMT activity. In addition, we demonstrated that mutant POMT1s that have been found in WWS patients have the ability to form a complex with POMT2, although they lost POMT activities. In yeast, the members of the PMT1 subfamily interact heterophilically with those of the PMT2 subfamily, whereas the single member of the PMT4 subfamily acts as a homophilic complex (17Girrbach V. Strahl S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12554-12562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 24Gentzsch M. Immervoll T. Tanner W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in human the single member of the PMT2 subfamily (POMT2) interacts with a member of the PMT4 subfamily (POMT1). These results suggest that the combination of interacting molecules has changed during evolution. It is noteworthy that only a single PMT member has been found in M. tuberculosis and that it has POMT activity (18VanderVen B.C. Harder J.D. Crick D.C. Belisle J.T. Science. 2005; 309: 941-943PubMed Google Scholar). It is unclear whether it forms a homophilic complex in vivo. Yeast PMTs and human POMTs are predicted to be integral membrane proteins with multiple transmembrane domains (25Willer T. Amselgruber W. Deutzmann R. Strahl S. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 29Jurado L.A. Coloma A. Cruces J. Genomics. 1999; 58: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, human and yeast POMT proteins showed differences in detergent sensitivity. Triton X-100 appeared to abolish human POMT activity (6Manya H. Chiba A. Yoshida A. Wang X. Chiba Y. Jigami Y. Margolis R.U. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) but did not inhibit yeast PMT activity (30Strahl-Bolsinger S. Tanner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This difference may be due to the lipid compositions in human and yeast, which would affect the efficiency of protein solubilization by detergents and the stability of proteins after the removal of lipids by detergents. Yeast Pmt1p has been proposed to consist of seven transmembrane helices (31Strahl-Bolsinger S. Scheinost A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9068-9075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The Pmt1p N terminus and loops 2, 4, and 6 are located in the cytoplasm, and the C terminus and loops 1, 3, and 5 are located in the ER lumen. A large hydrophilic region (loop 5) and loop 1 are important for enzymatic activity (17Girrbach V. Strahl S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12554-12562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 31Strahl-Bolsinger S. Scheinost A. J. Biol.

Based on this model, seven of ten POMT1 mutations identified in WWS patients appear to be located in loops 1 and 5 (7Beltran-Valero de Bernabe D. Currier S. Steinbrecher A.

Mutat. 2006; 27: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and three of four POMT2 mutations identified in WWS patients are located in loop 5 (8van Reeuwijk J. Janssen M. van den Elzen C. Beltran-Valero de Bernabe D. Sabatelli P. Merlini L. Boon M. Scheffer H. Brockington M. Muntoni F. Huynen M.A. Verrips A. Walsh C.A. Barth P.G. Brunner H.G. van Bokhoven H. J. Med. Genet. 2005; 42: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that loops 1 and 5 are important for catalysis, as they are in yeast PMTs. Furthermore, deletion of loop 5 in yeast Pmt1 eliminates enzymatic activity, but not Pmt1-Pmt2 interactions (32Girrbach V. Zeller T. Priesmeier M. Strahl-Bolsinger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19288-19296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutant POMT1 has the ability to form a complex with POMT2, although the complex does not have POMT activity. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of each domain in POMT activity and complex formation. Additionally, it has been shown that an Arg residue in the transmembrane domain is necessary for complex formation in yeast PMTs and a Glu residue in loop 1 is necessary for enzymatic activity (32Girrbach V. Zeller T. Priesmeier M. Strahl-Bolsinger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19288-19296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These amino acid residues are conserved in human POMT1 (33Willer T. Valero M.C. Tanner W. Cruces J. Strahl S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and so it will be interesting to see whether they also are necessary for complex formation and activity. It is also of interest to screen uncharacterized WWS patients for the Arg and Glu mutations. There is growing evidence that the glycans of glycoproteins play several roles in cellular differentiation and developmental events as well as in disease processes (34Haltiwanger R.S. Lowe J.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 491-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Glycosylation is basically controlled by the combined action of many glycosyltransferases. The level and the strict substrate specificity of glycosyltransferases cooperate to synthesize specific sugar sequences and sugar linkages found in glycoproteins. Glycosyltransferase activities are regulated by other factors or by complex formation. For example, human core 1 β3-galactosyltransferase activity requires the expression of Cosmc (35Ju T. Cummings R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16613-16618Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Cosmc is a molecular chaperone that specifically assists the folding/stability of core 1 β3-galactosyltransferase and is required for a glycosyltransferase expression. Mutations of COSMC were recently found in patients with Tn syndrome who could not produce core 1 structure (Galβ1-3GalNAc) (36Ju T. Cummings R.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Another glycosyltransferase with complex regulation is human chondroitin synthase, which cannot polymerize chondroitin sulfate in vitro; rather. its activity requires the coexpression of chondroitin-polymerizing factor (37Kitagawa H. Izumikawa T. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23666-23671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). As a third example, the bifunctional glycosyltransferases EXT1 and EXT2, which polymerize heparan sulfate, need to form a hetero-oligomeric complex to exert their optimal catalytic activities and to exist in the appropriate intracellular locations (38McCormick C. Duncan G. Goutsos K.T. Tufaro F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 668-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 39Kim B.T. Kitagawa H. Tanaka J. Tamura J. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41618-41623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed that protein O-mannosylation can be initiated by direct complex formation of POMT1 and POMT2, but not by either enzyme by itself. POMT1 or POMT2 are thus different from EXT1 and EXT2 because the latter enzymes are active by themselves. One possibility is that formation of the POMT1-POMT2 complex creates a new catalytic domain. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of complex formation between POMT1 and POMT2 and the regulation of POMT activity. Our results, together with previous studies of glycosyltransferases, indicate that glycosylation is regulated in a complicated fashion. Our findings that POMT1 and POMT2 associated physically and functionally in vivo and that POMT1 and POMT2 could not associate when they are expressed individually and then mixed suggest that the assembly of POMT1 and POMT2 requires specific conditions in the ER membrane. However, a heterocomplex POMT2 and mutated POMT1s suggest that single amino acid substitutions and deletion in POMT1 found in WWS patients do not affect assembly of POMT1 and POMT2. These mutations would abolish dolichol phosphate mannose or acceptor (α-DG) binding. In the POMT assay, cells transfected with mutated POMT1 and wild-type POMT2 (Fig. 4D, lanes 3-8`) had decreased enzymatic activity compared with the mock transfectant (Fig. 4D, lane 1). The decrease of endogenous enzymatic activity may be caused by the disturbance of endogenous POMT1-POMT2 formation. WWS patients carrying three mutations (G65R, A200P, and M582C) showed milder phenotypes than typical WWS (14Dincer P. Balci B. Yuva Y. Talim B. Brockington M. Dincel D. Torelli S. Brown S. Kale G.

Our finding that these mutant proteins did not have any enzymatic activity is thus puzzling. One possibility is that the levels of LARGE expression may be greater in these patients than in previous reported severe WWS patients. Barresi et al. (40Barresi R. Michele D.E. Kanagawa M.

However, the change of the LARGE expression level in WWS patients may be rare because these patients had hypoglycosylated α-DG (14Dincer P. Balci B. Yuva Y. Talim B. Brockington M. Dincel D.

Measurement of POMT activities of tissues from these patients would help to explain their mild symptoms. If each patient showed some POMT activities, other factor(s) that regulate POMT activity should be considered. In fact, some WWS patients have no mutations in POMT1 or POMT2 (7Beltran-Valero de Bernabe D. Currier S. Steinbrecher A. Celli J. van Beusekom E. van der Zwaag B. Kayserili H. Merlini L. Chitayat D.

Further studies are needed to test this hypothesis."

We have previously demonstrated that Muc4, a transmembrane mucin that promotes tumor growth and metastasis, physically interacts with the ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase and augments receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in response to the neuregulin-1β (NRG1β) growth factor. In the present study we demonstrate that Muc4 expression in A375 human melanoma cells, as well as MCF7 and T47D human breast cancer cells, enhances NRG1β signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. In examining the mechanism underlying Muc4-potetiated ErbB2 signaling, we found that Muc4 expression markedly augments NRG1β binding to A375 cells without altering the total quantity of receptors expressed by the cells. Cell-surface protein biotinylation experiments and immunofluorescence studies suggest that Muc4 induces the relocalization of the ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane. Moreover, Muc4 interferes with the accumulation of surface receptors within internal compartments following NRG1β treatment by suppressing the efficiency of receptor internalization. These observations suggest that transmembrane mucins can modulate receptor tyrosine kinase signaling by influencing receptor localization and trafficking and contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms by which mucins contribute to tumor growth and progression.

The ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases includes ErbB1/epidermal growth factor (EGF) 3The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; NRG1, neuregulin-1β; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; ASGP-1, asialoglycoprotein-1. receptor, ErbB2/Her2/Neu, ErbB3, and ErbB4. The EGF-like growth factor family of ligands binds the extracellular domain of the ErbB receptors leading to the formation of both homo- and heterodimers. Receptor dimer formation is followed by autophosphorylation of receptor intracellular domains, recruitment of intracellular signaling proteins, and the initiation of a number of signaling cascades that regulate cellular growth, motility, and survival. ErbB receptors play critical roles both in development and tissue maintenance (1Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Civenni G. Hynes N.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). While in general receptor heterodimerization is thought to diversify ErbB signaling (1Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5633) Google Scholar), heterodimerization with ErbB2 is required for ErbB3 signaling in response to the neuregulin-1 (NRG1) growth factor. No soluble growth factor ligand has been identified that binds to ErbB2, but it is the preferred dimerization partner of the other ErbB family members. Thus, it is thought that its function is to heterodimerize with the other ErbB family members to enhance signaling. ErbB3 is a binding receptor for NRG1 but lacks intrinsic kinase activity (3Guy P.M. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. Carraway III, K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) and is not capable of signaling on its own. The ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimer efficiently activates the Ras/Erk pathway, and the C-terminal domain of ErbB3 contains six binding sites for the p85 subunit of PI3K that very efficiently couple the activated receptor heterodimer to this pathway (4Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar). Muc4 is a member of the mucin gene family, and is a heterodimeric complex of two non-covalently linked subunits arising from a single gene (5Sheng Z.Q. Hull S.R. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8505-8510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The large (∼600 kDa) extracellular mucin subunit ASGP-1 is heavily O-glycosylated, and this portion of the molecule is thought to provide physical protection to epithelial surfaces. The membrane-associated subunit ASGP-2 (120 kDa) includes two EGF-like domains in its extracellular portion, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. Muc4 is expressed in epithelia of the airway, ocular surface, lacrimal gland, female reproductive tract, oral cavity, and mammary gland, where its expression increases dramatically during pregnancy and lactation (6Carraway K.L. Perez A. Idris N. Jepson S. Arango M. Komatsu M. Haq B. Price-Schiavi S.A. Zhang J. Carraway C.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 149-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been previously demonstrated that Muc4, also known as sialomucin complex, exists in a complex with ErbB2 in a number of tissues and cell lines, including rat mammary gland (6Carraway K.L. Perez A. Idris N. Jepson S. Arango M. Komatsu M. Haq B. Price-Schiavi S.A. Zhang J. Carraway C.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 149-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), lacrimal gland (7Arango M.E. Li P. Komatsu M. Montes C. Carraway C.A. Carraway K.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 2749-2756PubMed Google Scholar), ocular surface epithelia (8Swan J.S. Arango M.E. Carraway C.A. Carraway K.L. Curr. Eye Res. 2002; 24: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and female reproductive tract (9Idris N. Carraway C.A. Carraway K.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), as well as in the highly malignant rat ascites 13762 mammary adenocarcinoma cell line. Our previous expression studies demonstrate that the interaction of Muc4 and ErbB2 is mediated by their extracellular regions, and the N-terminal EGF-like domain of ASGP-2 is required for their association (10Carraway III, K.L. Rossi E.A. Komatsu M. Price-Schiavi S.A. Huang D. Guy P.M. Carvajal M.E. Fregien N. Carraway C.A. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5263-5266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Moreover, the co-expression of the two proteins in the same cell is necessary for their interaction, suggesting that soluble or shed forms of Muc4 may not interact with ErbB2 in vivo. One functional consequence of Muc4 interaction with ErbB2 is the potentiation of signaling in response to NRG1. Expression of Muc4 in A375 human melanoma cells results in the augmented tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2 and ErbB3 in response to growth factor (10Carraway III, K.L. Rossi E.A. Komatsu M. Price-Schiavi S.A. Huang D. Guy P.M. Carvajal M.E. Fregien N. Carraway C.A. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5263-5266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In addition, Muc4 expression in these cells enhances their growth rate as tumors (11Komatsu M. Yee L. Carraway K.L. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2229-2236PubMed Google Scholar) and their metastasis (12Komatsu M. Tatum L. Altman N.H. Carraway C.A. Carraway K.L. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) in nude mice, suggesting that Muc4-augmented signaling through ErbB receptors may contribute to tumor progression. In this regard, it is interesting that Muc4 is frequently co-expressed with ErbB2 in highly aggressive human breast cancers (13Komatsu M. Jepson S. Arango M.E. Carraway C.A. Carraway K.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), suggesting that overexpression of the mucin in tumors could augment ErbB2/ErbB3 signaling and tumor progression. In the present study we uncover the mechanism underlying the ability of Muc4 to enhance ErbB2/ErbB3 response to ligand. We demonstrate that Muc4 prevents the intracellular accumulation of ErbB2 and ErbB3, thereby increasing the amount of receptor localized to the plasma membrane. This correlates with enhanced coupling of ErbB2/ErbB3 to the PI3K pathway and augmented cellular proliferation.

Recombinant GST-NRG1β Fusion Protein Production—A recombinant beta isoform of neuregulin-1 was constructed by expressing the EGF-like domain of the beta isoform of NRG1 (sequence, TSHLIKCAEKEKTFCVNGGECFMVKDLSNPSRYLCKCPNEFTGDRCQNYVMASFYKHLGIEFMEAEELYQK) as a C-terminal GST fusion protein. Briefly, the EGF-like domain region was amplified from murine cDNA clones and inserted into the EcoRI/BamH1 sites of pGEX-6P-2 (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant plasmids were introduced into Origami B-competent cells, which support disulfide bond formation required for biologically active EGF-like domains. Expression was induced with 0.04 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 25°C prior to harvest. Frozen bacterial pellets were lysed using BugBuster supplemented with 200 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride and benzonase (17 units/ml). GST fusion proteins were bound to reduced glutathione-Sepharose beads and washed five times with ice-cold PBS, 0.2% Tween 20, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA followed by 5 washes with PBS, 1.0% Triton X-114 at 4 °C to remove bacterial endotoxins, and 5 rinses with PBS to remove excess Triton X-114, prior to three rounds of dialysis in 1× PBS at 4 °C. Factor concentrations were estimated by comparative Coomassie staining with bovine serum albumin. Cell Culture and Muc4 Induction—Construction of A375-Rep8, A375-Rep5, and MCF7-Rep5 cell lines expressing Muc4 under tetracycline regulation has been previously described (16Komatsu M. Carraway C.A. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33245-33254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% v/v penicillin/streptomycin, 0.8 mg/ml G418, 0.3 mg/ml hygromycin. Cells were grown to 60% confluence in the presence of 2 μg/ml tetracycline and then serum-starved in 0.1% fetal calf serum for 48 h in the presence or absence of 2 μg/ml tetracycline to induce Muc4 expression. Analysis of Receptor Phosphorylation and Downstream Signaling—Induced, serum-starved cells in 60-mm dishes were treated with 50 nm NRG1β for various times at 37 °C. For pathway inhibition experiments cells were treated with inhibitors for 30 min prior to growth factor addition. Cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS saline and lysed in 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 4 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Lysates were cleared by microcentrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min and added to SDS sample buffer. Lysates were resolved by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were cut horizontally into strips of the appropriate size ranges for detecting specific signaling proteins and immunoblotted as previously described (17Sweeney C. Fambrough D. Huard C. Diamonti A.J. Lander E.S. Cantley L.C. Carraway III, K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22685-22698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Blotted proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using an Alpha Innotech Digital Imaging Station. NRG1β titration analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism software. Each figure depicts a representative of at least three experiments. Transient Transfections—Human embryonic kidney HEK-293T cells, or human T47D breast cancer cells, were grown in 100-mm dishes and transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent as recommended by the manufacturer. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, HEK-293T cells were transfected with ErbB receptors without or with Muc4 construct Rep8 (16Komatsu M. Carraway C.A. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33245-33254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). For signaling experiments, T47D cells were transfected with HA-tagged Akt and HA-tagged Erk without and with Muc4 Rep8. Cells were serum-starved overnight prior to growth factor treatment, and cell lysates were collected as described above. Immunoprecipitation Experiments—Cells were lysed in co-immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 4 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin), and immunoprecipitation was carried out as previously described (17Sweeney C. Fambrough D. Huard C. Diamonti A.J. Lander E.S. Cantley L.C. Carraway III, K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22685-22698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Proliferation Analysis—150,000 A375-Rep8 cells were seeded in triplicate into 60-mm dishes and simultaneously serum-starved and treated with or without tetracycline for 12 h. Cells were then treated for 24 h with or without 50 nm NRG1β in the absence or presence of 20 μm LY294002 or 10 μm U0126. Cell number was determined using a Coulter counter after harvesting in 1× Trypsin-EDTA. p values were determined using an independent samples t test. Immunofluorescence—Serum-starved and -induced cells on 25-mm round cover slips were preincubated with 1/500 dilutions of primary antibodies (mouse monoclonal anti-ErbB3 Ab4, rabbit anti-ErbB2 Ab21, mouse monoclonal anti-EGFR Ab1, mouse monoclonal anti-ASGP-2 4F12) in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were then treated with growth factors at 37 °C for 20 min, rinsed with ice-cold PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells on coverslips were then blocked, incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies, and mounted as previously described (18Diamonti A.J. Guy P.M. Ivanof C. Wong K. Sweeney C. Carraway III, K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Receptors were visualized using an Olympus BX61 fluorescence microscope by capturing 12 z-plane images at 0.5-μm intervals encompassing the depth of the cell. Flat field-corrected image stacks were deconvolved by the constrained iterative method to mathematically remove out-of-focus light from the image stack using SlideBook 4.1 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations), resulting in confocal quality images of receptor localization in three dimensions. PS-Speck green and orange fluorescent beads (Molecular Probes) were used to generate the point spread functions used in deconvolutions. Preparation of Cell Membranes and Dephosphorylation Experiments—Induced cells were harvested in PBS, 1 mm EDTA and incubated in hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were homogenized with 80 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, and nuclei were pelleted at 3,000 × g for 5 min. Supernatants were then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 45 min, and the membranous pellets were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol with protease inhibitors. Preparations were kept frozen at -80 °C until use. For dephosphorylation assays, membranes were incubated with 5 mm MnCl2 and 100 μm ATP for 10 min at room temperature to allow receptor phosphorylation. The phosphorylation reaction was terminated with the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm, to elicit dephosphorylation. To promote receptor dimerization, membranes were incubated for various times in the absence or presence of NRG1β. In some cases calf intestinal phosphatase was added. Samples were collected in 2× SDS sample buffer at various time points after termination of the phosphorylation reaction and analyzed by immunoblotting. Preparation of Non-GST NRG1β and NRG1β Binding Assay—The GST moiety was cleaved from GSH-Sepharose-bound GST-NRG1β using PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences) per the manufacturer's instruction. Induced A375-Rep8 cells were treated with saturating concentrations of GST-NRG1β in combination with either increasing concentrations of non-GST NRG1β or GST alone, for 60 min on ice. Cells were extensively washed using ice-cold 1× PBS to remove unbound growth factor, and lysates were immunoblotted for GST. Bands were quantified by densitometry. Receptor Internalization Assay—GST-NRG1β was bound to induced, serum-starved A375-Rep8 cells as described above. After extensive washing with ice-cold PBS to remove unbound growth factor, cells were incubated at 37 °C for various times to initiate ligand internalization. Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and then treated on ice for 20 min with 0.2 m acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl, to dissociate remaining surface receptor-bound GST-NRG1β. Lysates were collected as described above and immunoblotted for GST. The density of each band was obtained using Alpha Innotech FluorChem software and used in the determination of internalization percentage. Receptor Biotinylation—Induced and uninduced cells were washed with ice-cold 1× PBS and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml Biotin-X-NHS dissolved in a borate buffer (10 mm boric acid, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) for 1 h at 4°C. Cells were extensively washed with ice-cold 1× PBS containing 15 mm glycine to terminate biotin coupling. Receptors were then immunoprecipitated and blotted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, or precipitated with streptavidin agarose and blotted with receptor antibodies. Muc4 Specifically Potentiates NRG1β-stimulated ErbB2 Tyrosine Phosphorylation and PI3K Signaling—We have previously shown that Muc4 expression potentiates NRG1β-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2 and ErbB3 and that these effects cannot be accounted for by an increase in overall receptor expression levels in cells (10Carraway III, K.L. Rossi E.A. Komatsu M. Price-Schiavi S.A. Huang D. Guy P.M. Carvajal M.E. Fregien N. Carraway C.A. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5263-5266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To examine the mechanisms underlying Muc4 potentiation of ErbB receptor signaling, we analyzed the properties of A375 human melanoma cells stably expressing rat Muc4 under tetracycline control (A375-Rep8 cells (16Komatsu M. Carraway C.A. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33245-33254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar)). As shown in Fig. 1, tetracycline withdrawal from A375-Rep8 cells potently induced Muc4 expression as determined by immunoblotting whole cell lysates with an antibody to the ASGP-2 subunit. Muc4 expression enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB receptors after stimulation with saturating concentrations (50 nm) of NRG1β, as observed by blotting for phosphotyrosine but did not augment basal receptor phosphorylation. Blotting with specific anti-phospho-ErbB2 antibodies revealed that Muc4 expression induced the hyperphosphorylation of ErbB2 at Tyr-1248 and Tyr-877, sites that have been implicated in ErbB2 signaling (19Akiyama T. Matsuda S. Namba Y. Saito T. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Ricci A. Lanfrancone L. Chiari R. Belardo G. Pertica C. Natali P.G. Pelicci P.G. Segatto O. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1519-1529PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2 at Tyr-1248 is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in human breast cancer (21Cicenas J. Urban P. Kung W. Vuaroqueaux V. Labuhn M. Wight E. Eppenberger U. Eppenberger-Castori S. Eur. J. Cancer. 2006; 42: 636-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). ErbB2 Tyr-1248 serves as a docking site for the adaptor protein Grb2, which links the activated receptor to signaling by the Erk serine/threonine kinases. Interestingly, whereas Tyr-1248 was hyperphosphorylated in the presence of Muc4, Erk signaling was unaffected as shown by the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and its downstream target p90RSK (Fig. 2A). However, Muc4 significantly potentiated the phosphorylation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt and its downstream transcription factor target Forkhead. Phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin target p70S6 kinase was also enhanced. These observed hyperphosphorylation events could not be explained by increased levels of the signaling proteins (data not shown) and point to the possibility that Muc4 selectively potentiates ErbB receptor signaling through the PI3K pathway. In contrast, Muc4 failed to potentiate Akt phosphorylation in response to EGF (Fig. 2B) and insulin (Fig. 2C), indicating that it specifically modulates ErbB2/ErbB3 receptor signaling. To determine whether these results may be extended beyond a single cell line, we examined the impact of MUC4 expression on NRG1 signaling in the human breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and T47D. As illustrated in Fig. 3A, Muc4 similarly potentiated NRG1β-induced stimulation of ErbB2/ErbB3 and Akt phosphorylation but not Erk phosphorylation in MCF7 cells stably transfected with tetracycline-regulated rat Muc4 (MCF7-Rep5 (16Komatsu M. Carraway C.A. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33245-33254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar)). Likewise, transient co-transfection of T47D cells with Muc4 and either HA-tagged Akt or HA-tagged Erk1 revealed that MUC4 selectively potentiated NRG1β-stimulated Akt but not Erk phosphorylation in these cells as well (Fig. 3B). Together these observations suggest that potentiation of ErbB2/ErbB3 signaling to Akt is a general feature of Muc4 expression. Because previous reports suggest Akt phosphorylation may be augmented in a PI3K-independent manner (e.g. Ref. 22Filippa N. Sable C.L. Filloux C. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4989-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), we first examined whether the Muc4-mediated Akt hyperphosphorylation was dependent on PI3K activity using the specific inhibitor LY294002. As illustrated in Fig. 4A, addition of LY294002 abolished all NRG1β-stimulated Akt phosphorylation, indicating that Muc4 mediates Akt hyperphosphorylation through the PI3K pathway. Because PI3K activation by the ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimeric complex is thought to be mediated largely by ErbB3 with its six p85 subunit binding sites (23Hellyer N.J. Kim M.S. Koland J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42153-42161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we examined whether Muc4 could enhance PI3K association with ErbB3. Fig. 4B demonstrates that Muc4 expression resulted in enhanced recruitment of p85 to NRG1β-stimulated ErbB3, with no impact on the levels of ErbB3 protein. As illustrated in Fig. 4C, PI3K pathway but not Erk pathway signaling is necessary for the proliferation of A375 cells. In this experiment 150,000 serum-starved cells were grown in the presence and absence of tetracycline or NRG1β, and cell number was determined after 24 h. Expression of Muc4 and treatment with 50 nm NRG1β each stimulated the growth of A375 cells (p = 0.001), and the two treatments together further augmented cellular growth. Proliferation was potently inhibited under all conditions by LY294002, but was unaffected by the MEK inhibitor U0126, even though each inhibitor very effectively suppressed its respective pathway (not shown). These observations indicate that the NRG1β-stimulated proliferation of these cells is strictly PI3K-dependent and that the selective potentiation of PI3K signaling by Muc4 drives enhanced cellular growth responses to growth factor stimulation. To better understand the mechanism by which Muc4 potentiates NRG1-stimulated PI3K signaling, we further investigated its interaction with ErbB2 and ErbB3 in the presence and absence of NRG1β. Co-immunoprecipitation of ErbB receptors with Muc4 could not be detected in A375 cells, possibly because receptor levels are relatively low. However, we observed that Muc4 could be co-immunoprecipitated with either ErbB2 or ErbB3, or both, in transiently transfected 293T cells, and the interactions could be detected independently of NRG1β treatment (Fig. 5). Taken together, the observations illustrated in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 point to a model whereby Muc4 interacts specifically with ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors to mediate their hyperphosphorylation. Potentiated receptor activity does not significantly impact Erk activation, either because events following receptor phosphorylation restrain Erk signaling, or because the level of receptor phosphorylation in the absence of Muc4 expression is sufficient to fully activate this pathway. However, Muc4-induced receptor hyperphosphorylation does lead to increased PI3K recruitment to ErbB3 and hyperactivation of Akt, which in turn contributes to Muc4-induced cellular proliferation. We consider below several possible mechanisms by which Muc4 could potentiate ErbB receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. Muc4 Does Not Alter the Sensitivity of NRG1β Signaling or Protect Receptors from Dephosphorylation—One possible explanation for Muc4-potentiated receptor phosphorylation is that mucin expression enhances the sensitivity of cell-surface receptors for ligand, yielding a greater number of receptors phosphorylated at moderate ligand concentrations. This seems unlikely, because our experiments were carried out under conditions of saturating growth factor ligand concentrations where all surface receptors should have been fully activated. However, to address this possibility we examined the dose response of receptor and Akt phosphorylation to NRG1β. A375-Rep8 cells were treated with and without tetracycline to induce Muc4 expression, and were then treated with increasing concentrations of NRG1β. As shown in Fig. 6A, Muc4 expression resulted in enhanced receptor phosphorylation and Akt activation at all concentrations of ligand. Receptor and Akt phosphorylation was quantified, and values were plotted to obtain the dose of NRG1β required for half-maximal receptor and Akt phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 6B, Muc4 expression had no effect on the NRG1β dose required for half-maximal receptor and Akt phosphorylation but enhanced the overall response of receptors to ligand, eve"

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is elevated in human colorectal cancers and plays an important role in colorectal tumorigenesis; however, the mechanisms by which APC mutations result in increased COX-2 expression remain unclear. We utilized APC mutant zebrafish and human cancer cells to investigate how APC modulates COX-2 expression. We report that COX-2 is up-regulated in APC mutant zebrafish because of a deficiency in retinoic acid biosynthesis. Treatment of both APC mutant zebrafish and human carcinoma cell lines with retinoic acid significantly reduces COX-2 expression. Retinoic acid regulates COX-2 levels by a mechanism that involves participation of the transcription factor C/EBP-β. APC mutant zebrafish express higher levels of C/EBP-β than wild-type animals, and retinoic acid supplementation reduces C/EBP-β expression to basal levels. Both morpholino knockdown of C/EBP-β in APC mutant zebrafish and silencing of C/EBP-β using small interfering RNA in HT29 colon cancer cells robustly decrease COX-2 expression. Our findings support a sequence of events in which mutations in APC result in impaired retinoic acid biosynthesis, elevated levels of C/EBP-β, up-regulation of COX-2, increased prostaglandin E2 accumulation, and activation of Wnt target genes.

Cyclooxygenases (COXs) 2The abbreviations used are: COX, cyclooxygenase; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; PG, prostaglandin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; hpf, hours post-fertilization; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein elements; MO, morpholino; RA, retinoic acid; rdh1l, retinol dehydrogenase 1-like.2The abbreviations used are: COX, cyclooxygenase; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; PG, prostaglandin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; hpf, hours post-fertilization; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein elements; MO, morpholino; RA, retinoic acid; rdh1l, retinol dehydrogenase 1-like. are the rate-limiting enzymes in the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins (PGs). The COX enzyme family consists of COX-1, which is constitutively expressed and thought to be involved in the housekeeping functions of PGs, and COX-2, an inducible isoform of COX that is involved in many inflammatory reactions. COX-2 is overexpressed in 40% of human adenomas and 80% of adenocarcinomas relative to normal mucosa (1.Eberhart C.E. Coffey R.J. Radhika A. Giardiello F.M. Ferrenbach S. DuBois R.N.

COX-2 is not detected in most normal tissues but is rapidly induced in response to mitogens, cytokines, and tumor promoters, leading to increased amounts of prostanoids in neoplastic and inflamed tissues (3.Smith W.L.

Previous studies demonstrated a key role for COX-2 in colorectal tumorigenesis, as well as a strong link between COX-2/PGE2 signaling and expression of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene in intestinal neoplasia. Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene APC result in familial adenomatous polyposis, an inherited type of colon cancer characterized by the development of thousands of polyps in the colon. Deletion of the cox-2 gene in apc knock-out mice, a murine model of familial adenomatous polyposis, resulted in a marked reduction in the number and size of intestinal polyps (5.Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of COX-2 activity by administration of traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or selective COX-2 inhibitors has been shown to reduce tumor size and multiplicity in genetic and carcinogen-induced animal models of colon cancer (5.Oshima M.

These data point at a key role of the enzymatic activity of COX-2 in the pathogenesis of colorectal carcinomas. Studies to define the molecular mechanisms controlled by APC have elucidated a model wherein APC is a negative regulator of β-catenin and the Wnt signaling pathway. In this model, APC serves as a scaffolding molecule that facilitates assembly of a multiprotein complex containing axin, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, and casein kinase 1α/ϵ. This complex promotes the phosphorylation of β-catenin, resulting in its ubiquitin-mediated degradation. In cells lacking functional APC, β-catenin accumulates and translocates into the nucleus where it associates with the transcription factors TCF/LEF, leading to the expression of Wnt target genes and inducing a program of cell proliferation. We recently reported that another essential function of APC is to regulate retinoic acid biosynthesis and promote colonocyte differentiation (11.Jette C. Peterson P.W. Sandoval I.T. Manos E.J.

Retinoic acid is a biologically active lipid mediator involved in the control of cell fate and differentiation (13.Duester G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4315-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In contrast to normal colon tissues, colon adenomas and carcinomas lack the ability to convert dietary retinol (vitamin A) into retinoic acid because they do not express retinol dehydrogenases (11.Jette C. Peterson P.W. Sandoval I.T. Manos E.J. Hadley E. Ireland C.M. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34397-34405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13.Duester G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4315-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Interestingly, APC mutant zebrafish exhibit features consistent with a retinoic acid-deficient phenotype, including aberrant intestinal differentiation that is rescued by treatment with retinoic acid (14.Nadauld L.D. Shelton D.N. Chidester S. Yost H.J. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30490-30495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The ability of APC to control a differentiation signaling pathway provides an additional mechanism by which mutations in APC may lead to colon adenomas and carcinomas. Although the association between loss of APC function and up-regulation of COX-2 has been demonstrated in vivo, it is not clear how these parameters are interrelated and what intermediates are involved. Important recent findings by Castellone et al. (15.Castellone M.D. Teramoto H. Williams B.O. Druey K.M. Gutkind J.S. Science. 2005; 310: 1504-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar) and Shao et al. (16.Shao J. Jung C. Liu C. Sheng H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26565-26572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PGE2, which is generated by the action of COX-2 on arachidonic acid, stimulates the proliferation of colon cancer cells by activating the β-catenin axis and Wnt signaling. These studies positioned PGE2, and thus COX-2, as upstream signaling molecules necessary for the activation of the β-catenin/TCF/LEF pathway. An important question that remained unanswered, however, was related to the mechanisms that lead to PGE2 accumulation through the COX-2 pathway in the absence of functional APC. Here we tested the hypothesis that APC negatively regulates COX-2 expression and investigated the mechanism involved using in vivo approaches in APC mutant fish and studies in human cancer cells. Our results first showed that the lack of functional APC correlated with the elevated expression of COX-2 in zebrafish, consistent with findings in mice and in humans. Second, we obtained evidence demonstrating a functional association between APC and COX-2. Third, we established that retinoic acid, the levels of which are controlled by APC, participates as an intermediate that suppresses COX-2 expression through a mechanism involving the transcription factor CEBP-β. Embryo Culture and Zebrafish Stocks—Wild-type and APC mutant Danio rerio (zebrafish) were maintained on a 14:10-h light/dark cycle. The characteristics of the truncated APC mutant zebrafish utilized in this study were described previously (17.Hsi L.C. Angerman-Stewart J. Eling T.E. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 2045-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Fertilized embryos were collected following natural spawnings and were allowed to develop at 28.5 °C. Control and experimental embryos were raised in 0.003% phenylthiourea to inhibit pigment formation. Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization—Zebrafish embryos were fixed in sucrose-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, dehydrated in methanol, and stored at -20 °C. Riboprobes for COX-2 and C/EBP-β were generated by linearization of pCRII (Invitrogen) containing COX-2 or C/EBP-β cDNA followed by in vitro transcription with SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). The embryos were cleared in 70% glycerol/phosphate-buffered saline and photographed using an Olympus DP12 digital camera. Quantitative RT-PCR—We isolated RNA from embryos and cell lines using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and then synthesized singlestranded cDNA from 1 μg of total RNA using Superscript III (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using a Roche Light Cycler instrument and software (version 3.5; Roche Applied Science). The sequences of PCR primers used were as follows: COX-2, forward, 5′-GGATGATGAGAGAATCTTCCAAACC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTCCAGAACTTTAACAGCGACTCC-3′; MMP9, forward, 5′-CCGCAATGATGGAAAACTCT-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGTGGAGCAGTGGTTGTTT-3′; and C/EBPβ, forward, 5′-AAAGTAACGGGCGACACGAACACA-3′, and reverse, 5′-TG-AGTCATTAAGCACCACGGGCT-3′. We performed duplicate PCRs using the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green 1 kit (Roche Applied Science). The amplification conditions for COX-2 included 10 s of denaturation at 95 °C, 5s of annealing at 61 °C, and 10 s of extension at 72 °C, for a total of 35 cycles. MMP9, and C/EBP-β were amplified using the same protocol except that annealing was set at 57 °C. A template-free negative control was included in each experiment. Quantitative RT-PCR primers and conditions for amplification of 28 S rRNA and human 18 S rRNA were described previously (11.Jette C. Peterson P.W. Sandoval I.T. Manos E.J. Hadley E. Ireland C.M.

Science. 2000; 289: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Morpholino and RNA Microinjections—We obtained morpholino oligonucleotides from Gene Tools LLC. An APC splice-blocking morpholino (5′-TAGCATACTCTACCTGTGCTCTTCG-3′), an rdh1l splice-blocking morpholino (5′-TCTGTCAGTGACTCACCCTTCTGTC-3′), a C/EBP-β translation blocking morpholino (5′-GATCTTAACACCCGCCGGATTGCG-3′), and a control morpholino (5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′) were dissolved in 1× Danieau buffer and adjusted to a final concentration of 1.0 mm. For microinjections, 1.0 nl of 1.0 mm morpholino was injected into wild-type embryos at the one- to four-cell stage. Messenger RNA for a stabilized form of β-catenin (β-catenin S37A) was synthesized using mMessage mMachine (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This stabilized β-catenin mRNA was injected into embryos at the one-cell stage. Retinoic Acid and Lithium Chloride Treatments—To investigate the role of retinoic acid in COX-2 expression in APC mutants and rdh1l morphants, we incubated embryos with 900 nm all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma) in Me2SO at 50% epiboly for 1 h. After washing with embryo water, we treated the embryos with 20 nm all-trans-retinoic acid at 30 and 54 hpf for 1 h and then repeated the washing step. To suppress C/EBP-β in APC mutants, embryos were incubated with 1 μm all-trans-retinoic acid for 2 h or with an equivalent amount of Me2SO as a control. To inhibit GSK-3β, we incubated embryos at 50% epiloby, 30 and 54 hpf with the indicated concentrations of LiCl (Sigma) dissolved in embryo water. Histological Analysis—Following in situ hybridization, embryos were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and embedded in paraffin. Six-micron sections were cut using a Leica microtome. Sections were analyzed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 Microfire camera (Optronics). Images were captured on Pictureframe software. Cell Culture and Drug Treatments—HEK293, HT29, HCT116, HaCaT, and SCC-9 cells were cultured as recommended by the American Type Culture Collection. HEK293, HCT116, HT29, and HaCaT cells were maintained in basal media in the absence of serum for 16 h prior to treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid or Me2SO as a control. Overexpression, Gene Silencing, and Promoter Activity Assays—HCT116 and SCC-9 cells were seeded at a density of 150,000 cells/well and transfected the next day using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. We used 1-2 μg of a stabilized form of β-catenin (β-catenin S37A), and we harvested the cells 48 h after the addition of DNA. We knocked down endogenous β-catenin expressed in HCT116, HT29, and SCC-9 cells using the same experimental approach except that Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used to transfect the siRNAs (final concentration = 50-100 nm). To assess promoter activation, we transfected HEK293 cells with 2 μg of DNA combined with a Rous sarcoma virus-Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid for normalization purposes using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. We seeded cells in 12-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells/well, performed transfections the next day, and harvested the cellular protein 24 h later. Luciferase activity was assessed using a dual luciferase assay system (Promega). The normalized values reported are the ratio between firefly and Renilla luciferase activities. Plasmids and Small Interfering RNAs—The COX-2 promoter-luciferase constructs used in this study were described in detail previously (19.Kutchera W. Jones D.A. Matsunami N. Groden J. McIntyre T.M.

The β-catenin S37A expression vector and dominant negative glycogen synthase kinase-3β (DN-GSK-3β) were kindly provided by Dr. Donald Ayer (University of Utah, Salt Lake City). The duplex targeting sequences used to silence expression of β-catenin were as follows: sense, 5′-CAGUUGUGGUUAAGCUCUUTT-3′, and antisense, 5′-AAGAGCUUAACCACAACCUGTT-3′. The sequences used to silence C/EBP-β expression were described previously (21.Heckman C.A. Wheeler M.A. Boxer L.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7891-7899Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and the control siRNA sequences were as follows: sense, 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′, and antisense, 5′-ACGUGCACGUUCGGAGAATT-3′. Western Blotting—We obtained extracts from zebrafish embryos in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega) with the aid of a Dounce homogenizer. The same buffer was used to harvest mammalian cells after individual treatments. Lysates were frozen at -80 °C and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 2 min to remove the insoluble components. We assessed protein concentration in the supernatants (using the BCA protein assay, Pierce) and then subjected 20-60 μg of protein to electrophoresis on 7.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. After electrotransfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PolyScreen), we stained the transferred proteins using Ponceau S solution for 2 min and then blocked the remaining protein-binding sites with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline. The primary antibodies used throughout this study were obtained from Cayman Chemical (anti-COX-2), Cell Signaling (anti-β-catenin), and ICN Biomedicals (anti-actin). We then probed the membranes with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (BIOSOURCE) and used a chemiluminescence detection system (Western Lightning) to reveal the presence of immunoreactive proteins. COX-2 Is Up-regulated in APC Mutant Zebrafish—Up-regulation of COX-2 following loss of the APC tumor suppressor gene appears required for the initiation of colon adenomas and carcinomas in mice and humans. It has been reported recently that zebrafish heterozygous for a truncating APC mutation spontaneously develop highly proliferative intestinal, hepatic, and pancreatic neoplasias (22.Haramis A.P. Hurlstone A. van der Velden Y. Begthel H. van den Born M. Offerhaus G.J. Clevers H.C. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Because this model recapitulated key features characteristic of digestive tract malignancies, we examined the connection between homozygous loss of APC and COX-2 overexpression using zebrafish embryos homozygous for mutant APC. We first compared COX-2 expression in APC mutants to that of wild-type zebrafish at the same stage of development. We performed quantitative RT-PCR using total RNA isolated from wild-type and APC mutant zebrafish embryos at 72 hpf. We found that COX-2 mRNA levels were 9-fold higher in the homozygous APC mutant zebrafish (APCmt) compared with wild-type 72 hpf zebrafish (Fig. 1A). We saw a similar induction of COX-2 mRNA in embryos wherein APC was knocked down using an antisense morpholino construct (APC MO). Immunoblot analyses of APC mutant embryos revealed that the COX-2 protein was also elevated in homozygous APC mutant embryos compared with wild-type animals (Fig. 1B). COX-2 is normally expressed in the carotid arteries, the vasculature of the pharyngeal arches, and in the vascular endothelium of the intestine at 96 hpf (23.Grosser T. Yusuff S. Cheskis E. Pack M.A. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8418-8423Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Whole mount in situ hybridization of COX-2 in wild-type embryos confirmed this expression pattern (Fig. 1C). In contrast, APC mutant zebrafish embryos expressed remarkably high levels of COX-2 mRNA in additional tissues and organs, including the fin buds, the pancreas, the intestine, and the skin (Fig. 1C). The hybridization studies were conducted at the same time and using the same developing solutions to rule out artifactual differences related to technical manipulations. Histological cross-sectional analyses performed after whole mount in situ hybridization revealed that COX-2 was expressed in the stromal compartment of the intestine and in the epithelial layer of the skin (Fig. 1D). COX-2 Regulation Is Independent of β-Catenin—Two recent independent studies reported that PGE2, one of the bioactive products of COX-2, activates components of the Wnt signaling pathway, thus providing solid evidence for a direct link between these pathways (24.Buchanan F.G. DuBois R.N. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 6-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we reasoned that the factor(s) accounting for up-regulation of COX-2 in the absence of functional APC must operate upstream of Wnt signaling. However, previous studies have reported that COX-2 was up-regulated by nuclear β-catenin accumulation in colon cancer cell lines, thereby suggesting it as a target downstream of Wnt (25.Araki Y. Okamura S. Hussain S.P. Nagashima M. He P. Shiseki M. Miura K. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 728-734PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated this incongruity using several experimental approaches first in zebrafish by injection of an mRNA encoding a variant of β-catenin, S37A, that is resistant to proteasomal degradation (26.Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24735-24738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Functional expression of β-catenin was confirmed by Western blotting. We found that overexpression of β-catenin had no effect on endogenous COX-2 mRNA expression levels (Fig. 2A, solid bars). In contrast, we observed robust up-regulation of mRNA for matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), a gene that is transcriptionally regulated by β-catenin (27.Tamamura Y. Otani T. Kanatani N. Koyama E. Kitagaki J. Komori T. Yamada Y. Costantini F. Wakisaka S. Pacifici M. Iwamoto M. Enomoto-Iwamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19185-19195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A, open bars). In complementary experiments, we increased β-catenin stability and enhanced its nuclear import by inhibiting the activity of endogenous glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) (28.Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). We used both a dominant negative approach (DN-GSK-3β; Fig. 2A) and pharmacological inhibition with LiCl (29.Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that although inhibition of GSK-3β effectively induced β-catenin and MMP9 (Fig. 2, A and B), these treatments failed to alter COX-2 expression levels (Fig. 2, A and B). To investigate if the observed lack of regulation of COX-2 by β-catenin was peculiar to zebrafish embryos, we used similar approaches in human cell lines. First, we transfected the stable β-catenin construct (S37A) into HCT116 colon carcinoma cells and SCC-9 squamous cell carcinoma cells and found no changes in the expression levels of endogenous COX-2 (Fig. 2C). Second, we silenced endogenous expression of β-catenin using siRNA in HCT116 and SCC-9 cells. We found that although this treatment successfully knocked down β-catenin protein levels, it had no effect on COX-2 expression levels (Fig. 2D). Overexpression of β-catenin also failed to activate a reporter construct wherein we fused 1.8 kb of the COX-2 promoter region to luciferase (data not shown). We concluded that the regulation of COX-2 is not subject to control by β-catenin in human cancer cells or in APC mutant zebrafish embryos. COX-2 Expression Is Suppressed by Retinoic Acid—We recently reported a previously unrecognized function of APC as a factor that controls retinoic acid biosynthesis through the retinol dehydrogenase enzymes in human colon cancer cell lines and in zebrafish embryos (11.Jette C. Peterson P.W. Sandoval I.T. Manos E.J. Hadley E. Ireland C.M. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34397-34405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12.Nadauld L.D.

Yost H.J. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30490-30495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here we hypothesized that APC may regulate COX-2 expression in a retinoic acid-dependent fashion. To test this, we asked if retinoic acid deficiency and COX-2 up-regulation were causally related. First, we treated developing APC mutant zebrafish embryos with exogenous retinoic acid and then determined the level of COX-2 mRNA. We found that this treatment significantly reduced COX-2 mRNA transcript levels in APC mutant embryos (Fig. 3A) and that this reduction included decreased expression of COX-2 in the intestinal stroma (Fig. 3B). To investigate this issue further, we knocked down expression of the retinol dehydrogenase, rdh1l, in zebrafish and then examined COX-2 expression. We found that retinoic acid deficiency alone resulted in the up-regulation of COX-2 using both in situ hybridization with a specific COX-2 probe and quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 3, C and D). Confirming that this was a retinoic acid-specific effect, treatment of rdh1l morphant embryos with exogenous retinoic acid reduced the levels of COX-2 (Fig. 3D). To extend the above findings in mammalian systems, we used human colon cancer cells and tested the effect of retinoic acid on the expression of COX-2 at the transcriptional level. We measured luciferase expression in HEK293 cells as well as the colon cancer cell line HCT116 following transfection with a reporter construct representing 1.8 kb of the COX-2 promoter fused to a luciferase reporter gene (19.Kutchera W. Jones D.A. Matsunami N. Groden J. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. White R.L. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4816-4820Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). In the case of HCT116 cells, we co-transfected the cells with a retinoic acid receptor-α expression construct necessary to attain cellular responsiveness to the ligand. Twenty four hours after transfection, we treated the cells with 5.0 μm retinoic acid for 6 h and measured subsequent luciferase activity. We found that this treatment significantly suppressed COX-2 promoter activity levels in both cell types (Fig. 4A). These findings were supported by examination of endogenous COX-2 expression in two cell lines, HT29 and HaCaT, which express relatively high amounts of COX-2. Treatment of either HT29 or HaCaT cells maintained in basal medium for 16 h, with vehicle, 1.0 μm and 2.0 μm retinoic acid in Me2SO for 4 h caused a dose-dependent decrease in COX-2 at both the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 4, B and C). Retinoic Acid Suppresses COX-2 by Regulating C/EBP-β—We reported previously that altered expression of COX-2 in colon cancer occurs at the transcriptional level (19.Kutchera W. Jones D.A. Matsunami N. Groden J. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. White R.L. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4816-4820Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein elements (C/EBP) in the promoter are necessary for a variety of agents to induce COX-2 expression (3.Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar, 30.Chen J.J. Huang W.C. Chen C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). First, the human COX-2 promoter contains multiple regulatory elements, including two functional cis-acting C/EBP sites. Second, the murine cox-2 promoter harbors C/EBP and ATF/CREB transcription factor-binding sites that have been identified as regulators of basal COX-2 expression in a murine model of lung adenocarcin"
https://openalex.org/W2138303427,"Upon hormone binding, a hydrophobic coactivator binding groove is induced in the androgen receptor (AR) ligand-binding domain (LBD). This groove serves as high affinity docking site for α-helical FXXLF motifs present in the AR N-terminal domain and in AR cofactors. Study of the amino acid requirements at position +4 of the AR FXXLF motif revealed that most amino acid substitutions strongly reduced or completely abrogated AR LBD interaction. Strong interactions were still observed following substitution of Leu+4 by Phe or Met residues. Leu+4 to Met or Phe substitutions in the FXXLF motifs of AR cofactors ARA54 and ARA70 were also compatible with strong AR LBD binding. Like the corresponding FXXLF motifs, interactions of FXXFF and FXXMF variants of AR and ARA54 motifs were AR specific, whereas variants of the less AR-selective ARA70 motif displayed increased AR specificity. A survey of currently known AR-binding proteins revealed the presence of an FXXFF motif in gelsolin and an FXXMF motif in PAK6. In vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer and functional protein-protein interaction assays showed direct, efficient, and specific interactions of both motifs with AR LBD. Mutation of these motifs abrogated interaction of gelsolin and PAK6 proteins with AR. In conclusion, we have demonstrated strong interaction of FXXFF and FXXMF motifs to the AR coactivator binding groove, thereby mediating specific binding of a subgroup of cofactors to the AR LBD. Upon hormone binding, a hydrophobic coactivator binding groove is induced in the androgen receptor (AR) ligand-binding domain (LBD). This groove serves as high affinity docking site for α-helical FXXLF motifs present in the AR N-terminal domain and in AR cofactors. Study of the amino acid requirements at position +4 of the AR FXXLF motif revealed that most amino acid substitutions strongly reduced or completely abrogated AR LBD interaction. Strong interactions were still observed following substitution of Leu+4 by Phe or Met residues. Leu+4 to Met or Phe substitutions in the FXXLF motifs of AR cofactors ARA54 and ARA70 were also compatible with strong AR LBD binding. Like the corresponding FXXLF motifs, interactions of FXXFF and FXXMF variants of AR and ARA54 motifs were AR specific, whereas variants of the less AR-selective ARA70 motif displayed increased AR specificity.

Members of this family share a common structural and functional organization, including an N-terminal domain (NTD) harboring activation function 1 (AF-1), a central DNA-binding domain (DBD), and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) containing activation function 2 (AF-2) (3Tsai M.J.

Upon binding of its ligand, testosterone or 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), AR LBD undergoes conformational changes leading to dissociation from heat shock proteins and translocation to the nucleus (6Chang C.

At the DNA, AR binds to specific androgen response elements to initiate target gene expression. Cofactors facilitate AR transcription function by histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and bridging of the receptor to other components of the transcription initiation process, including general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II (7Shang Y.

Wu J.H. Trifiro M. Hum. Mutat. 2004; 23: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Alanine scan mutagenesis of the AR FXXLF motif demonstrated that amino acid residues at positions +1, +4, and +5 are essential for interaction with the coactivator groove (21Steketee K.

Modeling and crystal structures of AR LBD in complex with FXXLF-like peptides, including AR and ARA70 FXXLF motifs, showed that amino acid residues at positions +1 and +5 are buried in the coactivator groove, rendering these residues entirely solvent inaccessible (17Dubbink H.J.

In contrast, the amino acid residue at position +4 rests in a shallow pocket on the periphery of the coactivator groove and is largely solvent exposed. Phage display screens for AR LBD-interacting peptides and directed mutagenesis studies of the AR FXXLF motif demonstrated that not only Phe but also Met, Tyr, and Trp residues at positions +1 and +5 could be compatible with binding to the AR coactivator binding groove, although Phe residues seem to be preferred (17Dubbink H.J.

Although it is presumed that the requirements for the amino acid residue at +4 in the FXXLF motif are less stringent than those at +1 and +5, our actual knowledge in this respect is limited. Here we performed a systematic functional analysis of the AR FXXLF motif mutated at +4. Yeast two-hybrid and mammalian one-hybrid experiments demonstrated that Leu to Phe and Leu to Met substitutions in the AR FXXLF motif are compatible with high affinity and specific AR LBD interaction. Strong and specific interaction was also obtained if the same substitutions were introduced in the ARA54 and ARA70 FXXLF motifs. As assessed by in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, functional protein-protein interaction assays, and mutagenesis, the AR partners gelsolin and PAK6 were found to contain an FXXFF and FXXMF motif, respectively, necessary and sufficient for AR LBD interaction. Plasmids—Yeast and mammalian expression plasmids encoding Gal4AD-, Gal4DBD-, and YFP-peptide fusion proteins were generated by in-frame insertion of double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides with 5′-BamHI and 3′-EcoRI cohesive ends into the corresponding sites of pACT2 (Takara Bio, Otsu, Shiga, Japan), pM-B/E (17Dubbink H.J.

For FRET experiments, Hep3B cells were cultured overnight on glass coverslips in 9.5-cm2 wells in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics. 4 h prior to transfection the medium was substituted by 1 ml of α-minimal essential medium containing 5% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum.

FRET Measurement by Acceptor Photobleaching—Live cell imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a PlanNeofluar ×40/1.3 NA oil objective (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) at a lateral resolution of 100 nm. CFP and YFP images were collected sequentially at 458 and 514 nm excitation, respectively, using a 458/514-nm dichroic beam splitter, a 515-nm beam splitter, and specific emission filters. CFP was excited with the 458-nm laser line of an Argon laser at moderate laser power and detected using a 470-500-nm band pass emission filter. YFP excitation was at 514 nm at moderate laser power and detected using a 560-nm emission filter. After sequential collection of YFP and CFP images, YFP was bleached by scanning 25 times a nuclear region of ∼100 μm2, covering a large part of the nucleus, using the 514-nm argon laser line at high laser power. After acceptor photobleaching a second YFP and CFP image pair was collected. The apparent FRET efficiency was calculated after background subtraction as shown in Equation 1 FRET=(CFPafter-CFPbefore)×YFPbefore(YFPbefore-YFPafter)×CFPafter(Eq. 1) where CFPbefore and YFPbefore are the average fluorescence intensities measured in the nuclei before bleaching and CFPafter and YFPafter the average fluorescence intensities after bleaching.

To study this, we tested every amino acid at this position in the context of the AR FXXLF motif using a yeast two-hybrid read-out system (Fig. 1A). In this assay, peptides were expressed as fusions to Gal4AD and AR LBD was fused to Gal4DBD. All assays were done in the presence of DHT (17Dubbink H.J. Hersmus R. Verma C.S. van der Korput H.A.

Western blot analysis of transformed yeast cells demonstrated that all Gal4AD-peptide fusion proteins were appropriately expressed (Fig. 1B). The yeast two-hybrid screening showed that most Leu+4 substitutions completely abolished AR LBD interaction (Fig. 1B). Reduced interaction was observed with peptides containing a Trp, Thr, Ile, Val, Cys, or Tyr residue at position +4 instead of a Leu. In contrast, AR LBD interactions were identical or even stronger than wildtype motif if Leu+4 were substituted by Phe or Met. FXXFF and FXXMF Variants of AR, ARA54, and ARA70 FXXLF Motifs Interact with AR LBD in Mammalian Cells—Next, we evaluated interaction capacities of FXXFF and FXXMF variants of AR FXXLF with full-length wild-type AR in a mammalian one-hybrid assay (Fig. 2A and Ref. 17Dubbink H.J.

Interaction was assayed in Hep3B cells cotransfected with Gal4DBD-peptide and full-length wild-type AR expression constructs and a (UAS)4TATA-LUC reporter. The results of this assay closely resembled the results obtained in yeast, as both FXXFF and FXXMF variants displayed hormone-dependent binding capacities comparable with the wild-type motif (Fig. 2B). We also investigated the interaction of the peptides with full-length F23L/F27L-mutated AR (F23L/F27L-AR), which abrogates AR N/C interaction (17Dubbink H.J. Hersmus R. Verma C.S. van der Korput H.A.

This resulted in increased interactions of the FXXFF and FXXMF variants (Fig. 2C), indicating that both compete with the FXXLF motif in the AR NTD for AR LBD binding. Subsequently, interaction of Phe+4 and Met+4 variants of ARA54 and ARA70 FXXLF motifs with AR LBD were assessed (Fig. 2A). The variants of both ARA54 (Fig. 2D) and ARA70 (Fig. 2F) interacted strongly with wild-type AR. All variants showed increased interactions with F23L/F27L-AR, indicative of interaction with the coactivator binding groove (Fig. 2, E and G). Summarizing, Leu+4 can be substituted by Phe or Met residues in distinct FXXLF peptide motifs, thereby retaining AR LBD interaction. Effects of Phe and Met Residues at Position +4onAR Specificity—Previously, we and others have demonstrated that FXXLF motifs, including those of AR and ARA54, display high specificity for AR (17Dubbink H.J.

Endocinol. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). However, some FXXLF motifs, including the ARA70 motif, also interacted with PR (39Dubbink H.J. Hersmus R. Pike A.C. Molier M. Brinkmann A.O. Jenster G. Trapman J. Mol. Endocinol. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We studied in yeast two-hybrid experiments the effect of Leu to Phe and Leu to Met substitutions at position +4 in the AR, ARA54, and ARA70 FXXLF motifs on AR specificity. Peptides were fused to Gal4AD, and LBDs of ERα, PR, and RXRα were fused to Gal4DBD. Upon ligand binding all NR LBDs adopted a functional conformation because strong interaction with a control LXXLL peptide, D11, was observed (Ref. 40Chang C. Norris J.D. Gron H. Paige L.A. Hamilton P.T. Kenan D.J. Fowlkes D. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8226-8239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). Contrary to a potent interaction with AR LBD (Fig. 3A), none of the FXXFF and FXXMF variant motifs interacted with LBDs of ERα, PR, or RXRα (Fig. 3B and data not shown). The specificity of the ARA70 FXXLF motif even increased upon Leu to Phe and Leu to Met substitutions as no PR LBD interaction was observed with the variant ARA70 motifs (Fig. 3B). The weak β-galactosidase activities detected with PR LBD were due to the intrinsic activity of Gal4DBD-PR LBD because similar values were obtained when this construct was expressed in the absence of a peptide expression construct (data not shown). These results demonstrate that Leu to Phe and Leu to Met substitution variants of FXXLF motifs remain AR specific or become even more specific. Naturally Occurring AR-interacting FXXFF and FXXMF Motifs—To assess a role of FXXFF and FXXMF motifs in cofactor-AR LBD interaction, we screened all AR-interacting proteins present in the AR gene mutations data base (www.mcgill.ca/androgendb; Ref. 29Gottlieb B. Beitel L.K. Wu J.H. Trifiro M. Hum. Mutat. 2004; 23: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and in the human protein reference data base (www.hprd.org) for the presence of these motifs. This yielded two proteins with an FXXFF (gelsolin and cdc37) and two with an FXXMF motif (PAK6 and supervillin). Mammalian one-hybrid experiments showed that the cdc37 FXXFF and supervillin FXXMF motifs weakly interacted with F23L/F27L-AR, but not with wild-type AR (data not shown). In contrast, the gelsolin FXXFF and PAK6 FXXMF motifs displayed strong hormone-dependent interactions with both F23L/F27L-AR and wild-type AR (Fig. 4, A and B). AR N/C interaction did not affect gelsolin FXXFF binding to AR LBD but reduced binding of the AR FXXLF and PAK6 FXXMF motifs, indicating that the gelsolin FXXFF motif had a higher affinity for AR LBD than the AR FXXLF and PAK6 FXXMF motifs. Both motifs are predicted to adopt an amphipathic α-helical structure (Fig. 4, C and D). FXXFF and FXXMF motifs present in AR cofactors gelsolin and PAK6 may thus be essential for interaction with AR. To extend our knowledge on the interactions between AR LBD and gelsolin FXXFF and PAK6 FXXMF peptide motifs, in vivo FRET experiments were carried out (Fig. 5A). Hep3B cells were"

Nucleolin is an abundant multifunctional phosphoprotein of proliferating and cancerous cells, recently identified as cell cycle-regulated transcription activator, controlling expression of human papillomavirus type 18 (HPV18) oncogenes in cervical cancer. Here we find that nucleolin is associated with Rb in intact cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and the complex formation is mediated by the growth-inhibitory domain of Rb. Association with Rb inhibits the DNA binding function of nucleolin and in consequence the interaction of nucleolin with the HPV18 enhancer, resulting in Rb-mediated repression of the HPV18 oncogenes. The intracellular distribution of nucleolin in epithelial cells is Rb-dependent, and an altered nucleolin localization in human cancerous tissues results from a loss of Rb.

The DNA was purified using a plasmid purification system (Qiagen), and cells were transiently transfected according to standard procedures. HPV18 URR-CAT activity was measured by a CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science), and the results were normalized to protein concentration according to the manufacturer's specifications. Immunohistochemistry and Detection of HPV—Immunostaining of paraffin sections of human cervix specimens with the Ab specific for an N-terminal peptide of nucleolin, affinity-purified on the peptide column, was performed as described (11Grinstein E.

Immunofluorescence Analysis and Confocal Microscopy—Cells grown on glass slides were fixed using methanol-acetone, and preincubation for 30 min in blocking solution containing phosphate-buffered saline and 1.5% normal serum (Vector Laboratories) was followed by immunofluorescence analysis according to standard procedures. Antibodies were diluted in blocking solution. Incubation with the rabbit polyclonal Ab specific for the N-terminal peptide of nucleolin, affinity-purified on the peptide column (11Grinstein E.

Med. 2002; 196: 1067-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), was at a dilution of 1:200 for 30 min at room temperature. The specificity of anti-nucleolin Ab was proved by peptide competition and Western blotting. For staining of cell nuclei, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was added in the last incubation step. Fluorescence microscopy was performed with a Leica microscope with a ×100 objective lens. Staining of cells for confocal microscopy was performed as described above. Mouse mAb specific for Rb (G3-245; Pharmingen) was used at a dilution of 1:100, according to the manufacturer's specifications. Specificity of the Ab was controlled by immunofluorescence staining of Rb-negative cells BT549 and Western blotting. Analysis of subcellular distributions was performed using a MultiProbe 2010 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Molecular Dynamics) equipped with a kryptonargon laser and an Indy work station (Silicon Graphics). Confocal analysis was performed with a resolution (pixel size) of 0.1 × 0.1 μm. Cell Cycle-dependent Interaction of Nucleolin with Rb—We analyzed the possibility that nucleolin may interact with Rb. To investigate whether nucleolin and Rb interact in vitro, pulldown experiments using GST-Rb and GST-nucleolin fusion proteins and nuclear extracts from exponentially growing epithelial cells CV1 and HBL100 were performed. The GST-nucleolin fusion protein comprised amino acid residues 289-707, and we refer to this as GST-nucleolin throughout. Interacting proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with Ab specific for Rb or nucleolin. Fig. 1A, top, shows that the GST-nucleolin fusion protein formed a complex with Rb (lane 2). In contrast, GST backbone protein alone did not interact with Rb (lane 3). The relative quantities of both GST-proteins used were monitored by immunoblotting with Ab specific for GST (Fig. 1A, bottom). The interaction of nucleolin with Rb was also demonstrated using a GST-Rb fusion protein in pull-down experiments (Fig. 1B, top, lane 2). The GST-Rb fusion protein consisted of the large A/B pocket and the C-terminal domain (amino acid residues 379-928) of Rb (30Kaelin W.G. Pallas D.C. DeCaprio J.A. Kaye F.J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 521-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), and we refer to this as GST-Rb throughout. GST backbone protein did not interact with nucleolin (Fig. 1B, top, lane 3). The quantities of both GST-proteins were equivalent, as was confirmed by immunoblotting with Ab specific for GST (Fig. 1B, bottom). Next, we analyzed Rb/nucleolin interactions by pull-down experiments relying on several mutant GST-Rb proteins (30Kaelin W.G. Pallas D.C. DeCaprio J.A. Kaye F.J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 521-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The GST-Rb 379-928 dl 738-775 fusion protein, containing a dl of amino acid residues 738-775, a tumor cell-derived mutation within the Rb pocket (37Horowitz J.M. Park S.H. Bogenmann E. Cheng J.C. Yandell D.W. Kaye F.J. Minna J.D. Dryja T.P. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2775-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), had a significantly reduced affinity for nucleolin, ∼15% as compared with GST-Rb (Fig. 1C, top, lanes 2 and 3). The GST-Rb 379-816 mutant, consisting to a large part of the A/B pocket, interacted with nucleolin to a similar extent as GST-Rb, suggesting that the deleted 112 C-terminal amino acid residues of Rb are not essential for the binding (Fig. 1C, top, lanes 5 and 6). Moreover, the GST-Rb 379-792 dl 573-645 mutant, consisting of the A and B parts of the pocket region, devoid of the spacer separating the A and B parts, interacted with nucleolin, with an affinity of ∼35% as compared with GST-Rb (lane 7). GST backbone protein was used as internal control (lanes 4 and 8). The relative quantities of the GST-proteins used were monitored by immunoblotting with Ab specific for GST (Fig. 1C, bottom). Thus, the pocket domain of Rb is involved in the interactions with nucleolin. The pocket domain is important for diverse functions of Rb (23Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 30Kaelin W.G. Pallas D.C. DeCaprio J.A. Kaye F.J. Livingston D.M.

To investigate whether nucleolin and Rb are associated in vivo, coimmunoprecipitation assays of endogenous proteins from nuclear extracts of exponentially growing epithelial cells were performed. Fig. 1D (left, lane 2) shows that the Ab specific for a N-terminal nucleolin peptide precipitated Rb from the CV1 cell extract. More than 5% of the endogenous cellular Rb was coimmunoprecipitated with nucleolin in this experiment. The presence of nucleolin in the same immunoprecipitate was demonstrated by an immunoblot with Ab specific for nucleolin (Fig. 1D, lane 6). Furthermore, Rb was neither precipitated with a control Ab specific for epidermal growth factor receptor (lanes 3 and 7) nor with the protein A/G-agarose beads (lanes 4 and 8). Fig. 1E (left, lane 2) shows that mAb specific for Rb precipitated nucleolin from the HBL100 cell extract, as was determined by immunoblotting with the Ab specific for nucleolin. The presence of Rb in the same immunoprecipitate was monitored by an immunoblot with Ab specific for Rb (Fig. 1E, lane 6). Nucleolin was neither precipitated with a control mAb (lanes 3 and 7) nor with the protein A/G-agarose beads (lanes 4 and 8). Thus, nucleolin and Rb are associated with each other in exponentially growing epithelial cells in vivo. Next, we investigated whether the interaction of nucleolin with Rb is subjected to cell cycle regulation. First, pull-down experiments using GST-nucleolin fusion protein and nuclear extracts from HBL100 cells, biochemically synchronized into cell cycle G1 and S phase populations, respectively, were performed. Fig. 2A shows that Rb from G1 phase cells efficiently bound to the GST-nucleolin fusion protein (Fig. 2A, left, top, lane 1). In contrast, no significant interaction of Rb from HBL100 cells in S phase was detected (Fig. 2A, top, lane 2). Immunoblotting with Ab specific for GST confirmed that equivalent amounts of GST-nucleolin were used (Fig. 2A, left, bottom). Western blot analysis demonstrated that Rb was present in similar amounts in both the G1 and S phase nuclear extracts employed in pull-down experiments (Fig. 2A, right, top). Cell synchronization efficiencies were confirmed by immunoblotting with Ab specific for cyclin A (Fig. 2A, right, bottom). The cell cycle dependence of the interaction of endogenous cellular nucleolin and Rb was then analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments, with lysates of HBL100 cells, biochemically synchronized into G1 and S phase populations and the Ab specific for a N-terminal nucleolin peptide. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with Ab specific for Rb or nucleolin (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2B shows that Rb from G1 phase cells was efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with nucleolin (left, lane 2), whereas in the S phase, no significant coimunoprecipitation of Rb with nucleolin was observed (lane 5). Rb was present in similar amounts in both the G1 and S phase cell lysates employed in coimmunoprecipitation experiments (lanes 7 and 8). The amounts of nucleolin in the immunoprecipitates from both G1 and S phase cell lysates were identical (Fig. 2B, middle, lanes 10 and 13). Rb was neither precipitated with control rabbit Ab (lanes 3, 6, 11, and 14) nor with the protein A/G-agarose beads (lanes 1, 4, 9, and 12). Cell synchronization efficiencies were confirmed by Western blot analysis of cyclin A expression (Fig. 2B, right). Thus, these results are interpreted as an identification of a cell cycle-regulated asso"

https://openalex.org/W1965527777,"WT1 was originally identified as an inactivated gene in Wilms tumor, a childhood kidney cancer. Alternative splicing of the WT1 transcript generates four major protein isoforms, each having different functional properties. Here we characterized a short transcript originating from a second promoter located within intron 1 of WT1. This 2.3-kb sWT1 transcript encodes a protein of ∼35–37 kDa that retains intact DNA-binding and transactivation domains but lacks the 147 amino acids at the N terminus required for transcriptional repression. We found sWT1 to be a more potent transcriptional activator than WT1 for cyclin E and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor promoters, which are normally repressed by WT1. The expression patterns of the sWT1 and WT1 transcripts differed slightly in various organs; we found sWT1 protein in tissue samples from adult testis and fetal kidney, with low-level expression in adult kidney as well. The sWT1 transcript, but not the full-length transcript, was over-expressed in the leukemia samples tested. sWT1-specific small interfering RNA retarded the proliferation of leukemia cell line K562 in vitro. Finally, sWT1 cooperated with Ras in transforming primary fibroblasts in vitro. Further studies are needed to clarify the oncogenic behavior of this isoform and to determine the mechanism underlying its up-regulation in leukemia and other forms of cancer.

Haber D.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 699-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The gene was originally identified by positional cloning and sequencing based on its association with Wilms tumor, a form of kidney cancer affecting children (2Haber D.A. Buckler A.J. Glaser T.

Specific mutations in WT1 can cause two types of genitourinary abnormalities in addition to Wilms tumor, namely Denys-Drash syndrome (3Pelletier J. Bruening W. Li F.P. Haber D.A. Glaser T. Housman D.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and Frasier syndrome (4Barbaux S. Niaudet P. Gubler M.C. Grunfeld J.P. Jaubert F. Kuttenn F. Fekete C.N.

Genet. 1997; 17: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), which manifest as male-to-female sex reversal, male pseudohermaphroditism, and cryptorchidism. The WT1 protein can act as a transcriptional activator or repressor depending on the cellular or chromosomal context (5Wang Z.Y. Qiu Q.Q. Enger K.T. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1990; 250: 1259-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The carboxyl (C) terminus contains four zinc finger domains that mediate DNA binding (7Haber D.A. Sohn R.L. Buckler A.J. Pelletier J. Call K.M. Housman D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9618-9622Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The amino (N) terminus comprises a transcriptional repression domain followed by a transactivation domain (5Wang Z.Y. Qiu Q.Q. Enger K.T. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8896-8900Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The four major isoforms of WT1 protein identified to date result from two alternative splices in its transcript. One of these splices encodes the insertion of three amino acids (KTS) between zinc fingers 3 and 4, which alters the DNA-binding properties of the protein (7Haber D.A. Sohn R.L. Buckler A.J.

The other splice results in the insertion of a 17-amino-acid segment, encoded by exon 5, in the middle of the protein (7Haber D.A. Sohn R.L. Buckler A.J. Pelletier J. Call K.M. Housman D.E. Proc.

Thus far, all identified WT1 isoforms differ only at their midsections and C termini and are derived from this alternative splicing; the variants result from alternative initiation of translation upstream or down-stream of the initial AUG (9Bruening W.

Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Curran T. Science. 1990; 250: 1259-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Transactivation assays of the –KTS (lysine, threonine, serine) variants of WT1 have identified distinct transcriptional activation (residues 180–294) and repression (residue 84–179) domains (5Wang Z.Y.

In Wilms tumor, WT1 clearly acts as a tumor suppressor gene; however, the precise role of WT1 in human leukemia has yet to be elucidated (18Miwa H. Beran M. Saunders G.F.

An oncogenic role of WT1 in leukemia has been suggested but not yet proven (21Loeb D.M. Sukumar S. Int. J. Hematol. 2002; 76: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). High level expression of WT1 may contribute to the maintenance of a malignant phenotype through a variety of mechanisms, including inhibition of differentiation and apoptosis and increased proliferation. Antisense inhibition of WT1 can block the growth of leukemic cells (22Yamagami T. Sugiyama H. Inoue K. Ogawa H. Tatekawa T. Hirata M. Kudoh T. Akiyama T. Murakami A. Maekawa T.

Although the role of WT1 in leukemia is not clear yet, its usefulness in diagnosis and treatment in leukemia is quite advanced. The presence and expression level of WT1 may serve as predictors of prognosis or relapse in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (24Weisser M. Kern W. Rauhut S. Schoch C. Hiddemann W. Haferlach T. Schnittger S. Leukemia (Basingstoke). 2005; 19: 1416-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Immunotherapy based on WT1 is also in preclinical development (25Henderson R.A. Mossman S. Nairn N. Cheever M.A. Vaccine. 2005; 23: 2359-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Inoue K. Sugiyama H. Ogawa H. Nakagawa M. Yamagami T. Miwa H. Kita K. Hiraoka A. Masaoka T. Nasu K. Blood. 1994; 84: 3071-3079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we describe sWT1, a newly identified, N-terminally truncated form of the protein that is overexpressed in leukemia and to act more like an oncogene than a tumor suppressor. Our functional studies showed that the sWT1 protein was much more effective than the full-length WT1 at transactivating target gene promoters but could not repress genes that are normally repressed by the full-length WT1. Antisense inhibition of sWT1 expression blocked growth of leukemic cells suggesting an oncogenic role for the sWT1 isoform in leukemia. 5′ RACE and PCR Cloning—We used rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) to identify mouse sWT1 in the Mouse Testis Marathon-Ready cDNA kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The first round of PCR was performed with sense (Wt1RACE-F1) and antisense (Wt1RACE-R1) primers and the sense anchor primer or the antisense anchor primer supplied by Clontech. Nested PCR was performed with the plus primer AP2 (Clontech) and either the new sense primer (Wt1RACE-F1.1) or the new anti-sense primer (Wt1RACE-R1.1). Several bands were obtained and cloned into a TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The sequencing results were compared with the known hsWT1 cDNA sequence. Northern Blotting and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis—A human multiple tissue expression array (Clontech) was hybridized with human exon 2–10 of sWT1 in NorthernMax hybridization solution (Ambion, Austin, TX) at 42 °C overnight. The membrane was washed twice with 2× SSC (sodium chloride/sodium citrate buffer) containing 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at room temperature for 10 min and twice with 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 20 min. Human total or poly(A) RNA was purchased from Ambion and Clontech. Single-stranded cDNA was prepared with the ThermoScript RT-PCR System (Invitrogen). PCR reactions were run with the GC-rich PCR system (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) with primers WT1RT-F and WT1RT-R for WT1 and primers sWT1RT-F and sWT1RT-R for the sWT1 isoform. The PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels. Each band was subcloned and confirmed by sequencing. Real-time RT-PCR—Fifty-two blood samples were analyzed, 27 from patients with acute myeloid leukemia at diagnosis, 18 from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 13 from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Patient characteristics and RNA isolation techniques have been described previously (27Patmasiriwat P. Fraizer G.C. Claxton D. Kantarjian H. Saunders G.F. Leukemia (Basingstoke). 1996; 10: 1127-1133PubMed Google Scholar). cDNAs were first amplified by conventional RT-PCR for the presence or absence of WT1 and sWT1 transcripts. Absolute quantification was done by real-time RT-PCR with primers and cDNA. To ensure that both the gene of interest and the control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were amplified at the same efficiency, several dilutions of cDNA (1, 5, and 10 ng) were amplified. Optimization was performed similarly, i.e. with primers and cDNA, and various concentrations of MgCl2 were used as a control. PCR was done with a LightCycler system (Roche Diagnostics) in a total reaction mixture of 10 μl containing 5 ng of cDNA, 1× LightCycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green 1, 4 mm MgCl2, and 1 μm each primer. After denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, 30 cycles were performed at 95 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. The data were normalized by using the ratio of the target cDNA concentration to GAPDH to correct for differences in the amounts of RNA among the samples. Plasmids—pcDNA3WT1 and pcDNA3sWT1 constructs were made by PCR amplification from human testis RNA. The resulting PCR products were subcloned into a modified pcDNA3 vector (28Hossain A. Li C. Saunders G.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1428-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) harboring the 5′-untranslated region of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa and NIH3T3 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cells were seeded at a density of 50,000–70,000 cells/well in 24-well plates 16–18 h before transfection. The cells were cotransfected with expression and reporter plasmids in various combinations. A plasmid containing cytomegalovirus (CMV)-β-galactosidase was cotransfected as an internal control to normalize for differences in transfection efficiency. The transfections were done with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and the cells were harvested after 40–48 h. Luciferase activity was measured with a Tropix luciferase assay kit (Applied Biosciences, Foster City, CA) and a Lumat LB9507 luminometer (EG & G Berthold). β-galactosidase was measured with the Tropix Galacto-Light Plus kit (Applied Biosciences). Gel Shift Assay—DNA-binding assays were performed with WT1-responsive elements from the SRY promoter (14Hossain A. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16817-16823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled probes were prepared by end labeling with [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 pmol of each labeled probe and 5 μl of in vitro translated protein extracts were used for each reaction. To assay for antibody-mediated supershift, 2 μl of antibody was added to the reaction mixture 15 min before the addition of the labeled probe. Samples were resolved in a 6% polyacrylamide gel cast in Tris borate-EDTA buffer containing 10 mm magnesium acetate at 4 °C for 3 h. The gels were dried and analyzed with a phosphorimaging device (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Western Blotting—Fifty micrograms of protein from different human tissue extracts (GenoTech, St. Louis, MO) were separated on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels by electrophoresis and immunoblotted with specific antibodies. The primary and secondary antibodies used were C terminus-specific anti-WT1 at a 1:20,000 dilution and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with peroxidase at a 1:100,000 dilution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Western blots were developed with SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce). siRNA Transfection—K562 erythroleukemia cells from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells (5–10 × 106) were transfected with various concentrations of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to sWT1 (GGAGAGGGUUUGAGGCCG Gtt) to WT1 (GGAGUUCAAGGCAG CGCCCtt) or a control (scrambled) sequence by using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were maintained in regular culture medium for up to 5 days. Cell growth was determined by counting viable cells after dye exclusion. Transformation Assay—NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts were transfected with various combinations of WT1, sWT1, and RasV12 expression vectors and selected with G418. Cells were split at 5 × 105 cells/100-mm dish for focus formation assays. Transfected cells were fed twice a week with fresh growth medium for 2 weeks. The cells were then washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 10 min in 10% (v/v) acetic acid, and stained for 10 min in 0.4% (w/v) crystal violet in 10% (v/v) ethanol. Dishes were rinsed with de-ionized water, air dried, and photographed. Cloning Human and Mouse Short Isoforms of WT1—The existence of an alternative form of WT1 was first suggested when a Northern blot from testis RNA produced a shorter 2.5-kb band alongside the full-length 3.1-kb band (29Pritchard-Jones K. Fleming S. Davidson D. Bickmore W. Porteous D. Gosden C. Bard J. Buckler A. Pelletier J. Housman D. van Heyningen V. Hastie N. Nature. 1990; 346: 194-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), leading us to seek the sequences in the mouse and human genomes that would give rise to the shorter form. The human expressed sequence tag (EST) National Center for Biotechnology Information data base dbEST contained potential cDNA sequences that would encode a WT1 protein lacking N-terminal residues. Although this short form of WT1 was being characterized in our laboratory, one group reported its cloning and monoallelic expression pattern in Wilms tumor (11Dallosso A.R. Hancock A.L. Brown K.W. Williams A.C. Jackson S. Malik K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The function and expression of sWT1 in humans, however, remain unknown. After our extensive searches of mouse genomic and expressed sequence tag databases with human exon 1a of WT1 turned up no similar alternative exonic sequences, we used 5′-RACE analysis of mouse testis RNA with primers specific to Wt1 exon 2 (Fig. 1A). Using these two primers, we detected a band of the expected size and cloned and sequenced it. A BLAST search of GenBank™ suggested that this band represents a novel Wt1 isoform that has not been reported; however, this band, representing a new exon within intron 1 of the mouse Wt1 gene, is not similar to exon 1a of human WT1, this novel isoform we called sWT1 (Wilms tumor gene 1 short) (Fig. 1B). The genomic location of exons 1 and 1a relative to each other and to exon 2 was revealed in a search of the mouse genomic sequence (Fig. 1A). The 5′ end, complete coding, and partial 3′ UTR sequence of sWT1 –KTS cDNA are presented in Fig. 1B. Comparison of the first exon of sWT1 with the first exon of WT1 showed no significant sequence similarities. However, the first exon of sWT1 contains a translation start codon ATG located at nucleotide 242, and the first three amino acids encoded by this exon 1a, MEK, are the same in the mouse and human proteins. Thus, even though the newly identified mouse sWT1 exon 1a was not similar to the exon 1a of human sWT1 at the nucleotide level, the coding sequences were identical. The GenBank™ accession number of the sWT1 transcript is DQ537939. Tissue-specific Expression of WT1 and sWT1 mRNA—First we compared the tissue distribution of sWT1 with that of the longer isoform WT1 by using RT-PCR with primers specific for each isoform as follows. PCR was performed on the first strand cDNA derived from various human tissues with primers specific for WT-1 and sWT1 that generated a 310-bp product for WT1 and a 230-bp product for sWT1. PCR amplifications from 13 human tissue types showed that the 310-bp fragment (representing WT1) was present in the adrenal gland, fetal and adult kidney, and testis and was absent or expressed at very low levels in the bone marrow, brain, breast, heart, liver, ovary, pancreas, spleen, and thymus. Expression of the 230-bp sWT1 was limited to the fetal kidney and testis (Fig. 2A). The absolute amount of WT1 and sWT1 expression was also quantified by real-time PCR (Fig. 2B). Next we analyzed the expression of WT1 and sWT1 in adrenal, bone marrow, breast, heart, testis, adult and fetal kidney, and ovary by northern blotting with a cDNA probe coding exons 2–10 of WT1. A single 3.1-kb band representing WT1 was detected in the adrenal, testis, and fetal kidney (with faint bands evident in the bone marrow and breast); a 2.3-kb band (sWT1) appeared in fetal kidney and faintly in adult kidney; only the fetal kidney showed both bands (Fig. 2C). These findings suggest that sWT1 expression is highly tissue-specific relative to WT1 in adult human tissues. Expression of sWT1 Protein—We also evaluated the expression of endogenous sWT1 protein in human tissues. Tissue extracts from adrenal, brain, breast, fetal and adult kidney, testis, ovary, spleen, heart, and pancreas were immunoblotted with an antibody directed against the C terminus of WT-1. No WT1 protein was present in extracts from adrenal, brain, breast, adult kidney, ovary, spleen, heart, or pancreas (Fig. 3). The antibody specifically recognized three bands in the extracts from fetal kidney and testis at ∼57 kDa (WT1 translated from the upstream open reading frame), ∼51 kDa (the full-length WT1 protein), and ∼35 kDa (the truncated sWT1) (Fig. 3). The sWT1 protein was detected in adult and fetal kidney and adult testis. In vitro translated WT1 and sWT1 were used as positive controls. These results suggest that sWT1 protein is expressed in vivo. DNA Binding of sWT1—Next we used gel shift assays to compare the ability of sWT1 and WT1 to bind DNA. Antibodies specific to the N or C termini of WT1 and a radiolabeled WT1-responsive element probe were added to in vitro translated WT1 or sWT1 protein to test the reactivity of the various DNA: protein complexes (Fig. 4). In the reaction between sWT1 and the WT1-responsive element, a high mobility complex was observed (Fig. 4, lanes 2–5) that could be supershifted only with the C terminus-specific antibody (lane 5) but not with the N terminus-specific antibody (lane 4) or a control Myc-specific antibody (lane 3). Lower mobility WT1-specific complexes (Fig. 4, lanes 7–9) were supershifted only with N terminus-specific antibody (Fig. 4, lane 9). These data suggest that the DNA binding ability of these two isoforms are similar. Gene Activation by WT1 and sWT1—To compare the cellular functions of WT1 and sWT1, at first we tested their ability to transactivate reporter genes in HeLa cells that had been transiently transfected with WT1 or sWT1. sWT1 was strikingly more effective than WT1 in the transactivation of both the SRY-driven and the p21-driven reporter genes (Fig. 5). These data suggest that sWT1, which lacks the first 147 residues of WT1, has enhanced transcriptional activity in different promoter contexts and support the concept of a general mechanism to regulate gene activation that is not strictly dependent on promoter sequences. Gene Repression by WT1 and sWT1—Some physiological effects mediated by WT1 occur through transcriptional repression of target genes via a repressor domain located in the N terminus of the WT1 protein (Fig. 1A). We compared the ability of WT1 with that of sWT1 to repress transactivation of cyclin E and the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R). Interestingly, WT1 repressed cyclin E and IGF-1R promoter activity, whereas sWT1 activated cyclin E and IGF-1R promoter activity (Fig. 6). The finding that sWT1 can activate genes that are normally repressed by WT1 supports the hypothesis that the activation and repression functions of WT1 occur separately in distinct regions of the protein. Expression of WT1 and sWT1 in Leukemia—Because WT1 expression has been implicated in leukemia (18Miwa H. Beran M. Saunders G.F. Leukemia (Basingstoke). 1992; 6: 405-409PubMed Google Scholar, 26Inoue K. Sugiyama H. Ogawa H. Nakagawa M. Yamagami T. Miwa H. Kita K. Hiraoka A. Masaoka T. Nasu K. Blood. 1994; 84: 3071-3079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Miyamura T. Sakata N. Okamura T. Yasui M. Inoue M. Yagi K. Sako M. Komada Y. Matsuyama T. Oda M. Park Y.D. Kawa K. Int. J. Hematol. 2004; 79: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), we next investigated the expression of WT1 isoforms in peripheral blood samples of 52 patients with adult leukemia. 12 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, 26 with acute myeloid leukemia, and 14 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, RNA-extracted from the samples was analyzed by RT-PCR (data not shown) and real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 7). Most of the samples contained a single predominant isoform, which in most cases (12 of 52) was sWT1. However, in 8 of 52 patients with adult leukemia, WT1 was the predominant isoform expressed (Fig. 7), and in 12 cases, both isoforms were almost equally expressed. In the remaining 20 cases, no WT1 or sWT1 expression was detected by RT-PCR or by real-time RT-PCR. Inhibition of Leukemia Cell Growth by sWT1-specific siRNA—We next examined the effect of siRNA to WT1 and to sWT1 on the growth of K562 cells, which are known to express both isoforms (Fig. 8A). Down-regulation of sWT1 by siRNA decreased the expression of endogenous p21 expression (Fig. 8B). Basal p21 promoter activity was low in sWT1-specific siRNA-treated K562 cells in comparison with the control, indicating that sWT1 was involved in the p21 promoter activation (Fig. 8C). Silencing sWT1 substantially inhibited K562 cell growth in comparison with a scrambled siRNA (Fig. 8D). Silencing WT1 also seemed to inhibit K562 cell growth, but this effect was not as striking as for silencing sWT1. WT1, sWT1, and Oncogenic Ras in Cellular Transformation in Vitro—Finally, to determine whether or not sWT1 has possible oncogenic property, NIH3T3 cells were cotransfected with H-RasV12 and either WT1 or sWT1 and tested for evidence of transformation (Fig. 9). NIH3T3 cells coexpressing sWT1 and H-RasV12 lost contact inhibition and produced foci in focus formation assays. This phenotypic manifestation of transformation was specific for sWT1, because cells coexpressing WT1 and RasV12 failed to do so. It is important to note that these sWT1 + Ras-expressing foci showed poor growth properties and were difficult to establish as long term cell lines. In this study, we characterized sWT1, a novel WT1 isoform directed by an internal promoter within the first intron of the WT1 gene. We found that expression of WT1 and sWT1 was restricted, and tissue-specific in adult tissue samples, both isoforms were found in fetal kidney and adult testis. The sWT1 mRNA was translated in vivo into an N-terminally truncated form of WT1. The transcriptional repression domain of WT1, as well as an alleged RNA recognition motif, has been located in the N terminus; however, sWT1 lacks both of these two motifs (31Kennedy D. Ramsdale T. Mattick J. Little M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 329-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 32Wang Z.Y. Qiu Q.Q. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9172-9175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found sWT1 to have several properties of interest. First, sWT1 was a more potent transcriptional activator than was the full-length WT1 protein, even though the DNA-binding ability of these two isoforms was similar. One possible explanation for this increase in activation is that the conformation of the sWT1 isoform may be more favorable than that of the full-length protein in terms of recruiting other coactivators such as CREB-binding protein/p300 (33Wang W. Lee S.B. Palmer R. Ellisen L.W. Haber D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16810-16816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). sWT1, which lacks a repressor domain in its N terminus (32Wang Z.Y. Qiu Q.Q. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9172-9175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), does not bind to factors such as HSP70 (34Maheswaran S. Englert C. Zheng G. Lee S.B. Wong J. Harkin D.P. Bean J. Ezzell R. Garvin A.J. McCluskey R.T. DeCaprio J.A. Haber D.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1108-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and thus may be more readily available to a coactivator. The most interesting functional property of this N-terminally truncated isoform was its inability to repress genes that are normally repressed by the full-length WT1; it actually activated genes (such as cyclin E and IGF-1R) that are typically repressed by full-length WT1. WT1 is known to regulate the development of a wide variety of organs by repressing or up-regulating downstream target genes by direct DNA binding (1Rivera M.N. Haber D.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 699-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar); knowledge of the function of sWT1 in vivo will probably require knocking down sWT1 in mice. Such experiments will also help to clarify the role of transcriptional activation versus that of transcriptional repression of WT1 in tumorigenesis (1Rivera M.N. Haber D.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 699-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To date, several laboratories, including ours, have reported overexpression of WT1 in up to 90% of patients with active leukemia (18Miwa H. Beran M. Saunders G.F. Leukemia (Basingstoke). 1992; 6: 405-409PubMed Google Scholar, 20Cilloni D. Saglio G. Acta Haematol. (Basel). 2004; 112: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26Inoue K. Sugiyama H. Ogawa H. Nakagawa M. Yamagami T. Miwa H. Kita K. Hiraoka A. Masaoka T. Nasu K. Blood. 1994; 84: 3071-3079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Patmasiriwat P. Fraizer G.C. Claxton D. Kantarjian H. Saunders G.F. Leukemia (Basingstoke). 1996; 10: 1127-1133PubMed Google Scholar). In studying the relative expression of WT1 and sWT1 in leukemia, we were surprised to find the expression of both isoforms, with a slightly higher level of the sWT1 isoform, in leukemia. sWT1 expression was very low to virtually undetectable in the peripheral blood of healthy controls. The ratio between these two isoforms may dictate the fate of certain types of tissue during development. sWT1 expression drives cells in the direction of proliferation. A high level of sWT1 expression may confer a growth or survival advantage to tumor cells by preventing or delaying the response to differentiation signals. However, in this study, we did not see a clear bias toward predominant sWT1 expression. WT1 mRNA produces two protein products due to an internal translation site (10Scharnhorst V. Dekker P. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23456-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The ratio between these two protein products is most likely important for WT1-mediated signal transduction. The protein product of sWT1 is almost identical to the internal translation product of WT1. The expression of sWT1 in cells that normally do not express sWT1 skewed the ratio toward transcriptional activation pathway. More comprehensive studies are necessary to better understand the role of WT1 and WTs in leukemia. We found also that siRNA directed against WT1 and sWT1 inhibited WT1 and sWT1 protein expression and slowed the proliferation of K562 cells by sWT1 to a greater extent than WT1. Reduction of WT1 by siRNA also decreased K562 cell proliferation but not as dramatically as sWT1 reduction. One possible explanation is that WT1 has an additional internal translation site, and the translated product behaves similar to sWT1 (10Scharnhorst V. Dekker P. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23456-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, in our experience, the predominant translation product was the full-length WT1 protein from WT1 mRNA (data not shown). We cannot rule out the possibility that a short translation product that retards growth might predominate in some subpopulation of K562 cells. The combination of sWT1 expression in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome and its minimal expression in normal tissues suggests that targeting the first exon of sWT1 by siRNA may be a good cancer therapy strategy. Using classical in vitro transformation assays, we showed that sWT1 exerts weak oncogenic functions in fibroblast. sWT1 cooperates with oncogenic ras in the transformation of NIH3T3 cells. sWT1 has no transforming capacity of its own in the NIH3T3 strains used in the present study. Our data show that neither sWT1 nor WT1 alone induce foci formation when transfected in primary cells, whereas transformed foci become evident upon cotransfection of sWT1 with Ha-rasV12 or Ha-rasV12 alone. On the other hand, WT1 failed to show any additive effects with Ha-rasV12. Therefore, the structural differences between sWT1 and WT1 reflect distinct functional roles, at least with respect to the cooperation with ras in cell transformation. In summary, these findings lead us to propose that sWT1 should be considered more of an oncogene than a tumor suppressor gene in leukemia cells. This proposal is based on the following findings: (i) the high expression of the sWT1 gene in leukemias, (ii) growth inhibition of leukemia cells by treatment with sWT1-specific siRNA, and (iii) enhanced Ras-induced in vitro transformation of NIH3T3 cells. Further studies are needed to delineate the complex roles of WT1 in disease and development. We thank Dr. R. Weinberg of Whitehead Institute for providing the cyclin E promoter construct and Dr. G. Lozano of M. D. Anderson Cancer Center for the p21 promoter construct."

Although beneficial at early stages, excessive inflammatory reaction leads to cell death and tissue damage. Cathepsin G (Cat.G), a neutrophil-derived serine protease, has been shown to induce neonatal rat cardiomyocyte detachment and apoptosis by anoikis through caspase-3 dependent pathway. However the early mechanisms that trigger Cat.G-induced caspase-3 activation are not known. This study identifies focal adhesion kinase (FAK) tyrosine dephosphorylation as an early mechanism that regulates Cat.G-induced anoikis in cardiomyocytes. Both FAK tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr-397 and kinase activity decrease rapidly upon Cat.G treatment and was associated with a decrease of FAK association with adapter and cytoskeletal proteins, p130Cas and paxillin, respectively. FAK-decreased tyrosine phosphorylation is required for Cat.G-induced myocyte anoikis as concurrent expression of phosphorylation-deficient FAK mutated at Tyr-397 or pretreatment with a protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitor, pervanadate, blocks Cat.G-induced FAK tyrosine dephosphorylation, caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. Analysis of PTPs activation shows that Cat.G treatment induces an increase of SHP2 and PTEN phosphorylation; however, only SHP2 forms a complex with FAK in response to Cat.G. Expression of dominant negative SHP2 mutant markedly attenuates FAK tyrosine dephosphorylation induced by Cat.G and protects myocytes to undergo apoptosis. In contrast, increased SHP2 expression exacerbates Cat.G-induced FAK tyrosine dephosphorylation and myocyte apoptosis. Taken together, these results show that Cat.G induces SHP2 activation that leads to FAK tyrosine dephosphorylation and promotes cardiomyocyte anoikis.

One of the earliest events during the progression of cardiac failure is thought to involve an inflammatory response where inflammatory cells and their proteases orchestrate myocardial repair. Although beneficial at early stages after myocardial injury, inflammatory cells release free radicals and proteolytic enzymes within the myocardium that may contribute to myocyte death and subsequent myocardial dysfunction (1Erlich J.H. Boyle E.M. Labriola J. Kovacich J.C. Santucci R.A. Fearns C. Morgan E.N. Yun W. Luther T. Kojikawa O. Martin T.R. Pohlman T.H. Verrier E.D. Mackman N. Am. J.

Pathophysiologically relevant concentrations of inflammatory proteases have been shown to mimic many aspects of the phenotype in experimental animals, including cardiac dilatation and dysfunction, activation of fetal gene expression, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and apoptosis. However, the mechanisms by which inflammatory proteases induce myocyte dysfunction are not well understood.

However, recent studies have focused on the actions of Cat.G to cleave G protein-coupled protease-activated receptors as a mechanism whereby Cat.G modulates coagulation and tissue remodeling at sites of injury and inflammation (3Molino M.

In cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs), we have shown that Cat.G activates a signaling cascade (MAPK, AKT, and caspase-3) that culminates in myocyte detachment and apoptosis. The effect of Cat.G on myocytes was independent of protease-activated receptors activation, and speculation was raised about the role of Cat.G to hydrolyze ECM components that are critical mediators of normal cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions and are necessary for cell survival (9Sabri A.

Cell adhesion to ECM through integrin receptors is critical for normal cell function (10Schaller M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1540: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Perturbation of proper cell-ECM interactions is observed in various acute and chronic pathological conditions including ischemia/reperfusion injury (11van de Water B. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J.

Loss of such interactions of normal cells results in the onset of apoptosis referred to as anoikis (12Frisch S. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2775) Google Scholar). Altered signaling that results from a loss of cell-ECM interactions is critical in this process, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) seems to play an important role (10Schaller M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1540: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 11van de Water B. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J. Biol.

Bayer A.L. Kalina J.A. Eble D.M. Samarel A.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1282-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, whether endogenous FAK in adherent cells (the physiological situation) is critical for the control of myocyte survival and whether this is directly related to changes in the focal adhesion (FA) organization is still unclear. Upon integrin binding to ECM, FAK is autophosphorylated on tyrosine residue 397, which is a docking site for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of Src family kinases (16Cobb B. Schaller M. Leu T.

As a consequence of Src binding, other tyrosine residues of FAK, including Tyr-576, Tyr-861, and Tyr-925, are phosphorylated resulting in increased kinase activity of FAK and additional docking of other adapter and signaling molecules, including p130Cas, paxillin, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Grb2 (10Schaller M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1540: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Thus, the coordinated activation of these complexes is likely to be critical in diverse cellular processes such as FA formation/turnover, cell spreading and migration, cell proliferation, and control of apoptosis. Focal adhesion formation is a dynamic process in which assembly and disassembly are regulated by the balance between the activity of kinase enzymes and the phosphatases that catalyzes the dephosphorylation reaction. Several intracellular protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) have been implicated as positive and negative regulators of integrin-mediated signaling (17Angers-Loustau A. Cote J.F. Tremblay M.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Gu J. Tamura M. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Key signaling components such as FAK, p130Cas, and Srcprotein-tyrosine kinases appear to be regulated by more than one PTP, probably reflecting the numerous signal inputs that can be integrated by this pathway. SHP2, PTP1B, PTP Pest, and PTEN all have been shown to modulate FA turnover by a direct action on FAK and p130Cas (18Gu J. Tamura M. Yamada K.M. J.

Moreover, spreading and migration defects are observed in fibroblasts prepared from gene-targeted mice that have null or functionally null SHP2, PTP1B, and PTP-PEST (19Angers-Loustau A. Cote J.-F.

Collectively, the above findings show that PTPs intersect with protein-tyrosine kinases at multiple points downstream of the integrins, and the ablated or increased PTP activity has profound effects on the integrin-mediated processes. In the present study, we described that treatment of myocytes with Cat.G at concentrations that are likely to occur in area of inflammation in vivo (22Weiss S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (3855) Google Scholar, 23Gibson T.L.B. Cohen P. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 1999; 9: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Yamazaki T. Aoki Y. Immunology. 1998; 93: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) induces early loss of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation and activity followed by important perturbations in FA organization as well as FAK-mediated myocyte survival signaling. Our data show for the first time a role for FAK and protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 in the control of Cat.G-induced anoikis in cardiomyocytes. Materials—Cat.G and okadaic acid were obtained from Calbiochem. Monoclonal antibodies to FAK, p130Cas, and paxillin were obtained from BD Biosciences, and polyclonal antibodies for FAK were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Phospho-FAK Tyr-397 and 4G10 monoclonal antibodies for phosphotyrosine were from Upstate Biotechnology. Polyclonal antibodies for phospho-SHP2, phospho-PTEN, and caspase-3 were from Cell Signaling. Polyclonal antibody for 20 S proteasome “core” subunits was from Biomol International. All other chemicals were from standard suppliers. Myocyte Preparation—Cardiac myocytes were isolated from the ventricles of neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats by collagenase digestion as previously described with minor modification (25Sabri A. Byron K.L. Samarel A.M. Bell J. Lucchesi P.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). After 30 min of preplating (to eliminate adherent fibroblasts), cells were plated at a density of 160,000/cm2 in 10% fetal bovine serum DMEM supplemented with 1 mmol/liter l-glutamine and antibiotic/antimycotic solution. Under these high density conditions, the myocytes form cell-cell contacts and display spontaneous contractile activity within 24 h of plating. Subcellular Fractions Preparation—Treated myocytes were homogenized in Triton X-100 extraction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2% Triton X-100) at 4 °C, containing 1:100 dilution of Sigma protease inhibitor mixture (P 8340) and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures I and II (P 2850 and P 5726) containing 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), aprotinin, leupeptin, bestatin, pepstatin-A, E-64 (trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane), cantharidin, bromotetramisole, microcystin, sodium orthovanadate, sodium molybdate, sodium tartrate, and imidazole. Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble components were prepared as described previously (26Kuppuswamy D. Kerr C. Narishige T. Kasi V.S. Menick D.R. Cooper IV, G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4500-4508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, the homogenized extract was centrifuged at 16,000 × g, with the supernatant representing the detergent-soluble fraction (soluble). The pellet was re-extracted with 1 ml of Triton X-100 extraction buffer to remove remaining detergent-soluble proteins. Re-extraction was followed by centrifugation, removal of the supernatant, and final resuspension of the pellet (insoluble low spin pellet) in SDS-sample buffer. The supernatant from the first spin was spun again at 100,000 × g for 2.5 h to obtain a membrane pellet (insoluble high spin pellet), and the pellet fraction was processed as described before (26Kuppuswamy D. Kerr C. Narishige T. Kasi V.S. Menick D.R. Cooper IV, G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4500-4508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To all the detergent-soluble fractions, equal volumes of SDS-sample buffer were added. All samples with SDS-sample buffer were boiled for 5 min for gel electrophoresis. Expression of Adenoviral Vectors—Production of recombinant adenovirus expressing wild-type FAK (WT-FAK) and dominant negative FAK (Tyr-397-FAK, a mutant that lacks autophosphorylation/SRC homology SH2 binding site) was described elsewhere (27Streblow D. Soderberg-Naucler C. Vieira J. Smith P. Wakabayashi E. Ruchti F. Mattison K. Altschuler Y. Nelson J. Cell. 1999; 99: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). FAK protein expression was driven by coinfection with adenovirus expressing the Tet transactivator Ad-TA as described (27Streblow D. Soderberg-Naucler C. Vieira J. Smith P. Wakabayashi E. Ruchti F. Mattison K. Altschuler Y. Nelson J. Cell. 1999; 99: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Cells were infected at 10, 25, or 25 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell for Ad-TA or Ad-TA with Ad-WT-FAK or Ad-Tyr-397-FAK, respectively. Recombinant adenovirus wild-type SHP2 or dominant negative SHP2 polypeptide (DSH2, a truncated construct lacking the catalytic site and containing only the tandem SH2 domains of SHP2) were prepared as described previously (28Chang Y. Ceacareanu B. Dixit M. Sreejayan N. Hassid A. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Adenoviral vectors were purified using a kit from Virapur and titrated using BD Adeno-X rapid titer kit (BD Bioscience). NRCMs were infected with adenovirus in DMEM for 2 h, then 5% fetal bovine serum DMEM was added, and cells were incubated for an additional 48 h. Serum-free DMEM/F-12 medium was changed 1 h before the start of the experiments. Inhibition of apoptosis mediated by Tyr-397-FAK overexpression was mediated by 2 h treatment with 100 μm concentrations of broad specificity caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, and infections was performed 48 h after treatment. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Extraction of proteins from cultured cells was performed as described previously (29Sabri A. Govindarajan G. Griffin T.M. Byron K.L. Samarel A.M. Lucchesi P.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 841-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm, and the supernatants (1 mg of protein/ml) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with corresponding antibodies. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, protein A- or G-agarose beads were added and left for an additional 3 h. Immunocomplexes were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis according to methods published previously or to the manufacturer's instructions (29Sabri A. Govindarajan G. Griffin T.M. Byron K.L. Samarel A.M. Lucchesi P.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 841-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Each panel in each figure represents results from a single gel exposed for a uniform duration, with bands detected by enhanced chemiluminescence and quantified by laser scanning densitometry. In Vitro Kinase Assays—FAK was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal FAK antibodies as described above except that the lysis buffer contained no SDS. The kinase reactions were done in kinase assay buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmol/liter MnCl2, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, and 20 μmol/liter ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were then separated by SDS-7.5% PAGE and dried gels were exposed to x-ray film. Immunofluorescence—NRCMs were grown on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated with anti-FAK or anti-SHP2 antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washes, cells were incubated with texas red phalloidin or anti-20 S proteasome followed by incubation with Alexa-conjugated anti-mouse (-rabbit) Ig antibodies. After final washes and mounting, cells were examined using an epifluorescence microscope (Leica, Bannockburn, IL). Caspase-3 Assay—Caspase-3 activity was measured with the CaspACE assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). In brief, myocyte lysates were prepared by Dounce homogenization in lysis buffer provided with the kit. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants containing 100 μg of protein were used for caspase-3 assay. Caspase-3 activity was examined by measurement of the rate of cleavage of fluorogenic conjugated substrate (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Val-Asp-Gln-Met-Asp-Gly-Trp-Lys-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-NH2. The specificity of the assay was confirmed by addition of the specific caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK in the reaction mixture at a concentration of 50 μm during the incubation. Apoptotic Cell Death ELISA—A cell death detection ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science) was used to quantitatively determine the apoptotic DNA fragmentation by measuring the cytosolic histone-associated mono- and oligonucleosomes fragments associated with apoptotic cell death. DNA Fragmentation—Treated myocytes were lysed with lysis buffer (0.8 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 8 mm Tris-HCl (TE, pH 8.0) and 4% SDS), and DNA was extracted from the lysed cells followed by incubation with 40 μg/ml proteinase K and 40 μg/ml RNase for 1 h at 37°C. The DNA was precipitated with 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 2 volumes of ice-cold ethanol at -20 °C overnight. Finally, pellets were resuspended in TE buffer, and DNA concentrations were quantified from the absorbance at 260 nm. 6-8 μg of DNA samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Data Analysis—All experiments were performed at least three times from three different cultures, and results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance 1. Data were considered statistically significant if p was <0.05. Cathepsin G Induces FAK Dephosphorylation and Inactivation prior to Cell Morphology Changes and Detachment—NRCMs undergo retractile morphological changes and detachment from the ECM upon Cat.G treatment (9Sabri A. Alcott S.G. Elouardighi H. Pak E. Derian C. Andrade-Gordon P. Kinnally K. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23944-23954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism(s) underlying this effect, we examined the effect of Cat.G treatment on the tyrosine phosphorylation state of FAK and correlated these with morphological changes. Upon Cat.G treatment, FAK was rapidly dephosphorylated, as determined by blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. This occurred within 10-15 min, and FAK remained hypophosphorylated for over 30 min (Fig. 1A). This decrease in FAK tyrosine phosphorylation does not result from FAK degradation as full-length blot probing for FAK with a polyclonal antibody did not detect any effect of Cat.G on FAK cleavage at 15 and 30 min (Fig. 1B). However, a small amount of more rapidly migrating FAK immunoreactivity (whose size corresponds to the truncated FAK fragment generated via caspase cleavage) accumulates at 1 h after Cat.G treatment. Since the kinase activity of FAK is regulated by its level of tyrosine phosphorylation (30Calalb M. Polte T. Hanks S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we performed an in vitro kinase assay to measure FAK kinase activity after immunoprecipitation with FAK-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 1C, FAK immunoprecipitated from cells treated with Cat.G for 5 and 15 min had reduced autophosphorylation activity compared with FAK from untreated cells. FAK can be tyrosine-phosphorylated on a number of tyrosine residues, including Tyr-397, that is required for its kinase activity. To assess whether Cat.G affect FAK Tyr-397 phosphorylation site, we performed Western blot using a well characterized phosphospecific antibody (31Ruest P.J. Roy S. Shi E. Mernaugh R.L. Hanks S.K. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 41-48PubMed Google Scholar). FAK Tyr-397 phosphorylation decreased in a time-dependent manner. The decrease began 5 min after Cat.G treatment and remained markedly low 30 min after Cat.G treatment (Fig. 1D). Consistent with a reduction in FAK tyrosine phosphorylation and activity, a decreased association between FAK and p130Cas or paxillin, two important components of FA that associate with and are phosphorylated by FAK (32Polte T. Hanks S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), is also observed after Cat.G treatment (Fig. 1, E and 1F). To investigate whether p130Cas and paxillin are also regulated by Cat.G stimulation, analysis of p130Cas and paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation was performed. p130Cas and paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation was decreased in response to Cat.G, and the kinetics of this decrease correlated with the kinetics of FAK decreased tyrosine phosphorylation upon Cat.G stimulation (Fig. 1, E and F). These data indicate that Cat.G negatively regulates the kinase activity of FAK and associated downstream signaling molecules. Although Cat.G-induced FAK tyrosine dephosphorylation occurred within 10-15 min after Cat.G treatment, Cat.G-induced morphological changes and cardiomyocyte detachment were observed only 30 min after treatment with Cat.G and became more dramatic at2hof Cat.G stimulation (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the cellular morphological changes, a dramatic reorganization of FAK labeling was observed after 30 min of Cat.G treatment (Fig. 2, B and C). In control NRCMs, FAK staining was densely concentrated in the perinuclear regions but less markedly at the cellular periphery, where it was diffusely distributed as has been decribed previously (33Torsoni A.S. Constancio S.S. Nadruz Jr., W. Hanks S.K. Franchini K.G. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 34Takahashi N. Seko Y. Noiri E. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Sabe H. Yazaki Y. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1194-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin, which labels sarcomeric actin, revealed the typical sarcomeric pattern of repetitive striations, with the labeled structure representing the actin array of two adjacent sarcomeres (Fig. 2B, panel a). Although FAK was detected close to myofilaments, its distribution pattern was not defined and no consistent superimposition to myofilaments was observed. After 30 min of Cat.G treatment, FAK immunostaining, which was mostly localized in the central regions at a higher density, appeared to scatter to the peripheral cytoplasm and was seen as clusters overlapping the regions stained with phalloidin (Fig. 2B, panel b). This ectopic localization of FAK and actin in clusters is reminiscent of protein undergoing degradation. Therefore, we tested whether FAK aggregates associate with the proteasome complex. Anti-serum raised against the 20 S core particle of the proteasome complex was used to stain cells and the same perinuclear and peripheral cytoplasm pattern of punctate staining was respectively seen in both controls and myocytes treated with Cat.G (Fig. 2C). This indicates a colocalization of FAK and the proteasome complex and shows that FAK degradation by the proteasome occurs at basal conditions, where it may play a role in FAK turnover, and in response to Cat.G treatment, suggesting that tyrosine-dephosphorylated FAKs are targeted for degradation by the proteasome. Consistent with this finding, Cat.G-induced FAK degradation was inhibited when cells were pretreated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (data not shown). These results suggest that FAK-decreased tyrosine phosphorylation and inactivation might be causally involved in Cat.G-induced rearrangement of FA components that are necessary for the morphological changes observed in cardiomyocytes. FAK Overexpression Rescue Myocyte Apoptosis Induced by Cathepsin G—To gain more insight into the role of FAK in Cat.G signaling, we conducted gain- or loss-of-function experiments, in which we transduced NRCMs with adenoviruses carrying WT-FAK or truncated form of FAK (Tyr-397-FAK, a mutant that lacks autophosphorylation/SRC homology SH2 binding site). Infected cardiomyocytes showed accumulation of WT-FAK in the cytoplasm and FA (Fig. 2B, panel c) and increases of 5-fold over control TA-infected cells (Fig. 3A). Treatment with Cat.G did not significantly affect FAK distribution (Fig. 2B, panel d) or FAK tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3B) compared with WT-FAK-infected controls. In comparison, myocytes infected with Tyr-397-FAK showed accumulation of FAK in the cytoplasm, myofibrils, and stress fibers (Fig. 2B, panel e) and increases of 3.5-fold over TA-infected cells (Fig. 3A). Treatment with Cat.G did not show significant reorganization of FAK labeling (Fig. 2B, panel f) or FAK tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3B) compared with Tyr-397-FAK-infected controls. Cat.G also led to marked cardiomyocyte remodeling and loss of myofibril organization in TA-infected myocytes and overexpression of WT-FAK significantly attenuated Cat.G-induced loss of myofibrils (Fig. 2D). In contrast, Tyr-397-FAK overexpression promoted loss of myofibril organization in ∼30% of infected myocytes (mostly in peripheral regions), and treatment with Cat.G did not have any additional effect on myofibril organization (Fig. 2D).

https://openalex.org/W1996157991,"Thrombin activates protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) and engages signaling pathways that influence the growth and survival of cardiomyocytes as well as extracellular matrix remodeling by cardiac fibroblasts. This study examines the role of Shc proteins in PAR-1-dependent signaling pathways that influence ventricular remodeling. We show that thrombin increases p46Shc/p52Shc phosphorylation at Tyr239/Tyr240 and Tyr317 (and p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation) via a pertussis toxin-insensitive epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation pathway in cardiac fibroblasts; p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation is via a MEK-dependent mechanism. In contrast, cardiac fibroblasts express β2-adrenergic receptors that activate ERK through a pertussis toxin-sensitive EGFR transactivation pathway that does not involve Shc isoforms or lead to p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation. In cardiomyocytes, thrombin triggers MEK-dependent p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation, but this is not via EGFR transactivation (or associated with Shc-Tyr239/Tyr240 and/or Tyr317 phosphorylation). Importantly, p66Shc protein expression is detected in neonatal, but not adult, cardiomyocytes; p66Shc expression is induced (via a mechanism that requires protein kinase C and MEK activity) by Pasteurella multocida toxin, a Gαq agonist that promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. These results identify novel regulation of individual Shc isoforms in receptor-dependent pathways leading to cardiac hypertrophy and the transition to heart failure. The observations that p66Shc expression is induced by a Gαq agonist and that PAR-1 activation leads to p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation identifies p66Shc as a novel candidate hypertrophy-induced mediator of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and heart failure.

Cardiac hypertrophy and the progression to heart failure is the result of a complex array of signaling events that lead to structural remodeling of the ventricle. The literature has focused primarily on signaling mechanisms that regulate cardiomyocyte growth and survival. However, cardiac fibroblasts (activated by fibrogenic growth factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines) also play an important role in influencing the architecture and mechanical behavior of the heart by regulating collagen matrix remodeling and by elaborating growth factors that promote cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Extensive cardiac fibroblast-induced structural remodeling disrupts the normal transmission of electrical impulses, impairs contractile performance, and critically influences clinical heart failure syndromes.

We previously demonstrated that chronic/persistent PAR-1 activation leads to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac fibroblast proliferation (1.Sabri A. Short J. Guo J. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). PAR-1-dependent growth responses are mediated by distinct signaling mechanisms in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. PAR-1 evokes a robust increase in ERK, p38-MAPK, and AKT and increases DNA synthesis via an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation pathway in cardiac fibroblasts, whereas PAR-1 activates ERK (and induces only a relatively minor increase in AKT) via a mechanism that does not require EGFR kinase activity in cardiomyocytes. The contextual nature of PAR-1 signaling emphasizes the need to directly examine PAR-1 actions in physiologically relevant cardiac preparations. Shc proteins are molecular adapters that link surface receptors to mitogenic responses. Shc is expressed as three isoforms that are encoded by a single gene locus (2.Pellegrini M. Pacini S. Baldari C.T. Apoptosis. 2005; 10: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 3.Ravichandran K.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6322-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). p46Shc and p52Shc are ubiquitous isoforms that arise through the use of alternative translation initiation sites within the same transcript. In contrast, p66Shc expression is restricted to certain cell types and stimulatory conditions through epigenetic modifications of its distinct promoter (4.Ventura A. Luzi L. Pacini S. Baldari C.T. Pelicci P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22370-22376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). All three Shc isoforms share a common domain organization consisting of a C-terminal SH2 domain, an N-terminal PTB domain (slightly truncated in p46Shc), and a central CH1 with phosphorylation sites at Tyr239/Tyr240 and Tyr317 (nomenclature based on human p52Shc). Phosphorylation at Tyr239/Tyr240 and Tyr317 creates docking sites for the Grb2-SH2 domain, which constitutively associates with the Ras exchange factor SOS, activates the Ras-ERK pathway, and induces mitogenic responses. This function is particularly important for p52Shc, which is hyperphosphorylated in many tumors and oncogenic when overexpressed in fibroblasts (5.Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Salcini A.E. Romano A. Mele S. Grazia B.M. Segatto O. Di Fiore P.P. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 899-907PubMed Google Scholar). p66Shc also contains the three sites for growth factor-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation (and it is tyrosine-phosphorylated and binds Grb2 in cells treated with EGF or subjected to oxidative stress). However, the subcellular targeting and signaling functions of p66Shc and p46/p52Shc are quite different. p66Shc does not couple to Ras/ERK activation and it does not transform rodent fibroblasts. Rather, p66Shc inhibits Ras/ERK signaling and blunts mitogenic responses, at least in part by competing with p52Shc for a limited pool of Grb2 (6.Pacini S. Pellegrini M. Migliaccio E. Patrussi L. Ulivieri C. Ventura A. Carraro F. Naldini A. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P. Baldari C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1747-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). p66Shc also has emerged as a pivotal regulator of oxidative stress responses and life span in mammals. p66Shc sensitizes cells to apoptosis through a mechanism that involves its unique N-terminal CH2 domain (not present in p46/p52Shc) and specifically a phosphorylation event at Ser36 (stimulated by PMA, UV irradiation, or H2O2 (7.Migliaccio E.

Giorgio M. Cicalese A. Barozzi S. Ventura A. Migliaccio E. Milia E. Padura I.M. Raker V.A. Maccarana M. Petronilli V. Minucci S. Bernardi P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G.

Finkel T. Science. 2002; 295: 2450-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Finally, p66Shc localizes to mitochondria where it participates in membrane depolarization during oxidative stress (10.Orsini F. Migliaccio E. Moroni M. Contursi C. Raker V.A. Piccini D.

Although these studies identify p66Shc as a critical transducer of oxidative stress signals (and a recent study implicates p66Shc in the deleterious cardiac remodeling induced by subpressor doses of angiotensin II), the mechanisms that control Shc protein expression or activation in the heart have largely been neglected in the literature (12.Graiani G. Lagrasta C. Migliaccio E. Spillmann F. Meloni M. Madeddu P. Quaini F. Padura I.M. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P. Emanueli C.

PAR-1 increases Shc tyrosine phosphorylation (and Shc is implicated in PAR-1-dependent mitogenic responses) in non-cardiac model systems (14.Collins L.R. Ricketts W.A. Olefsky J.M. Brown J.H. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15.Ricketts W.A. Brown J.H. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1988-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, studies to date have generally been confined to experiments that use anti-phospho-Tyr antibodies (and do not resolve phosphorylation at the Tyr239/Tyr240 and Tyr317 sites), focusing generally on phosphorylation of the abundant p52Shc isoform (or heterologously overexpressed Shc proteins). Mechanisms that regulate Shc phosphorylation in cardiac fibroblasts or cardiomyocytes have never been examined. This report takes advantage of phosphorylation site-specific antibodies (PSSAs) to track thrombin-dependent phosphorylation of native Shc proteins (at physiologic expression levels) in the heart. We demonstrate that thrombin promotes p46/p52Shc-Tyr239/Tyr240 and -Tyr317 (and p66Shc-Ser36) phosphorylation via an EGFR transactivation pathway in cardiac fibroblasts and that thrombin increases p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation (without increasing p46/p52Shc-Tyr239/Tyr240 and -Tyr317 phosphorylation) through a PKC and MEK (but not EGFR transactivation) pathway in cardiomyocytes. We also show that Gαq activation increases p66Shc expression and Ser36 phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes, identifying p66Shc as a candidate hypertrophy-induced modifier of cardiac apoptosis. Cardiac Fibroblast and Cardiomyocyte Cultures—Cardiomyocytes were isolated from the hearts of 2-day-old Wistar rats by a trypsin dispersion procedure using a differential attachment procedure to enrich for cardiomyocytes followed by irradiation as described in detail in previous publications (1.Sabri A. Short J. Guo J. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The yield of cardiomyocytes typically is 2.5–3 × 106 cells/neonatal ventricle. Cells were plated on protamine sulfate-coated culture dishes at a density of 5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish. Experiments were performed on cultures grown for 5 days in minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and then serum-deprived for the subsequent 24 h. Primary cardiac fibroblast cultures were obtained from the cells adherent to the culture dishes during the preplating step as described previously (1.Sabri A. Short J. Guo J. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Measurements of cAMP accumulation and immunoblotting (on lysates or immunoprecipitated proteins) were done according to methods described previously or the manufacturer's instructions (1.Sabri A. Short J. Guo J. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). All antibodies in immunoblotting studies were from Cell Signaling Technology, with each panel in each figure representing results from a single gel (exposed for a uniform duration); detection was with enhanced chemiluminescence. Recombinant Pasteurella multocida toxin (PMT) was expressed and purified as described previously (16.Wilson B.A. Ponferrada V.G. Vallance J.E. Ho M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 80-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All results were replicated in at least four experiments on separate culture preparations. Shc and ERK Are Downstream Targets of the Thrombin-activated PAR-1 Signaling Cascade in Cardiac Fibroblasts—Fig. 1A shows that thrombin promotes a rapid (maximal at 2–5 min) and transient increase in ERK activity, measured as an increase in phospho-ERK immunoreactivity and decreased ERK protein mobility in SDS-PAGE. Thrombin and PMA induce comparable increases in ERK activity, whereas the magnitude of the ERK response to EGF is ∼18% higher (n = 7, p < 0.05). Thrombin also promotes Shc tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). Cardiac fibroblasts express all three Shc isoforms. p52Shc is slightly more abundant than p46Shc and p66Shc; it is the predominant Tyr239/Tyr240- and Tyr317-phosphorylated species in resting cultures. Thrombin promotes p46Shc and p52Shc phosphorylation at Tyr239/Tyr240 and Tyr317; this response is detected at 2–5 min and wanes thereafter (at 30 min, similar to the kinetics of thrombin-dependent ERK activation). In contrast, thrombin induces a very minor increase in p66Shc-Tyr239/Tyr240 phosphorylation, which is variably detected only in some experiments; thrombin-dependent p66Shc-Tyr317 phosphorylation was not detected. Control experiments show that all three Shc isoforms are phosphorylated at Tyr239/Tyr240 and Tyr317 in response to EGF. Although thrombin does not consistently increase p66Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, thrombin slows the mobility of p66Shc in SDS-PAGE (without altering the mobility of the smaller p46/p52Shc isoforms). This thrombin-dependent mobility shift (characteristic of a post-translational modification) has been attributed to agonist-induced phosphorylation at Thr29, Ser36, and/or Ser138 (in the unique N-terminal extension of p66Shc (17.Faisal A. El-Shemerly M. Hess D. Nagamine Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30144-30152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)). Although p66Shc-Ser138 corresponds to p52Shc-Ser29, p52Shc-Ser29 phosphorylation does not lead to an obvious p52Shc mobility shift; p46Shc lacks N-terminal phosphorylation sites and is not regulated through this mechanism. The thrombin-dependent p66Shc mobility shift is pronounced at 5 min and sustained for at least 30 min. EGF and PMA also slow the mobility of p66Shc. PMA (which promotes p66Shc phosphorylation at all three potential Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites) induces the most pronounced p66Shc mobility shift (17.Faisal A. El-Shemerly M. Hess D. Nagamine Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30144-30152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The smaller mobility shifts induced by thrombin and EGF could be due to phosphorylation at fewer sites on p66Shc (or phosphorylation events at all three sites, but on a limited pool of p66Shc protein). We previously demonstrated that thrombin stimulates ERK in cardiac fibroblasts primarily via a pertussis toxin (PTX)-insensitive pathway involving EGFR transactivation by Src family kinases; PTX-sensitive Gi proteins also link PAR-1 to ERK activation, but this is a minor pathway in cardiac fibroblasts (1.Sabri A. Short J. Guo J. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although both pathways in theory could increase Shc tyrosine phosphorylation (18.van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), Fig. 2A shows that thrombin-dependent increases in p46/p52Shc-Tyr239/Tyr240 and -Tyr317 phosphorylation are completely blocked by the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478 and the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1. EGF-dependent Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and ERK activation also are blocked by AG1478 (but not PP1). Collectively, these results place Src family kinases upstream from EGFRs in the PAR-1-dependent pathway leading to Shc phosphorylation. EGFR transactivation (and the MEK-ERK cascade) also underlies the thrombin-dependent p66Shc mobility shift, because the thrombin-dependent p66Shc band shift is blocked by AG1478, PP1, and the MEK inhibitor U0126 (Fig. 2B) (under conditions where AG1478 and PP1 markedly attenuate and U0126 completely inhibits ERK activation by thrombin). EGF also slows the mobility of p66Shc via a mechanism that is blocked by AG1478 and U0126, further implicating p66Shc as a downstream target of the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway. The effects of PMA to alter p66Shc mobility and activate ERK are markedly attenuated by U0126, but not by AG1478 or PP1 (Fig. 2B). Although these results implicate MEK as an upstream component of the p66Shc-Ser/Thr phosphorylation pathway, Fig. 2B provides surprising evidence that a minor component of the PMA response (both the p66Shc band shift and ERK activation) is resistant to U0126 (under conditions where U0126 completely abrogates ERK activation by thrombin and EGF). In contrast, PMA responses are completely blocked by GF109203X (which completely inhibits phorbol ester-sensitive PKC isoforms, Fig. 2C). These results suggest that PKC-dependent p66Shc-Ser/Thr phosphorylation occurs via a MEK-independent pathway. Of note, MEK-independent ERK activation mechanisms have been noted in other cell types (and recently attributed to a PKCϵ-Lck pathway in primary human Schwann cells (19.Jorgensen K. Skrede M.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9188-9193Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)). PAR-1 Promotes p66Shc-Ser36 Phosphorylation via EGFR Transactivation in Cardiac Fibroblasts—The next series of studies used a PSSA to determine whether thrombin promotes p66Shc phosphorylation at Ser36 (a site uniquely implicated in oxidative stress responses). Preliminary studies show that this PSSA identifies p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation in lysates from thrombin-, PMA-, and H2O2-treated cultures, but not in post-immunoprecipitation lysates that have been cleared of Shc proteins (Fig. 3A). Although these results validate the selectivity of this PSSA, the results show relatively high background nonspecific immunoreactivity in Western blots on cell lysates with this PSSA. Therefore, p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation was examined using an immunoprecipitation approach; Shc proteins were immunoprecipitated from resting and activated cultures and then probed with the anti-p66Shc-pSer36 PSSA and an anti-Shc protein antibody (to validate equal protein recovery and loading). Fig. 3B shows that p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation is not detected in resting cardiac fibroblasts; it is induced by thrombin, PMA, and (to a lesser extent) EGF. The pharmacologic profiles for the agonist-dependent p66Shc mobility shift and p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation are identical (compare Figs. 2B and 3C). The thrombin-dependent increase in p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation is blocked by AG1478, PP1, and U0126 (i.e. it is via an EGFR transactivation mechanism involving Src family kinases and MEK). The EGF-dependent increase in p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation also is blocked by AG1478 and U0126, whereas the PMA-dependent increase in p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation is attenuated by U0126 (and completely blocked only when incubations are performed in the presence of GF109203X). Shc Proteins Are Not Components of the β2-Adrenergic Receptor (AR)-ERK Pathway in Cardiac Fibroblasts—Previous studies identified a β2-AR-dependent pathway leading to EGFR transactivation, ERK stimulation, and increased DNA synthesis in serially passaged adult rat cardiac fibroblast cultures (23.Kim J. Eckhart A.D. Eguchi S. Koch W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32116-32123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), but a potential role for Shc proteins as components of β2-AR signaling responses was not considered. Fig. 4A shows that isoproterenol induces a transient increase in ERK activity, but there are key differences in the signaling responses to isoproterenol and thrombin: 1) isoproterenol weakly activates ERK compared with the very robust increases in ERK activity triggered by thrombin, angiotensin II, or EGF; 2) isoproterenol increases cAMP accumulation, whereas thrombin does not alter cAMP levels in cardiac fibroblasts (Fig. 4B); 3) thrombin stimulates AKT, whereas β-ARs activate ERK without increasing AKT (Fig. 4C) (4.Ventura A. Luzi L. Pacini S. Baldari C.T. Pelicci P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22370-22376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). PAR-1 and β2-ARs both activate ERK via an EGFR transactivation pathway (that is completely abrogated by AG1478) but via different G proteins (Fig. 4C). β2-ARs activate ERK via a PTX-sensitive Gi protein mechanism, whereas the PAR-1-dependent ERK activation pathway is largely PTX-insensitive (5.Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Salcini A.E. Romano A. Mele S. Grazia B.M. Segatto O. Di Fiore P.P. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 899-907PubMed Google Scholar). Isoproterenol-dependent β2-AR activation does not detectably increase Shc-Tyr239/Tyr240 phosphorylation or p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation; β2-ARs do not decrease the electrophoretic mobility of p66Shc (Fig. 4, D and E). Shc Isoform Regulation in Cardiomyocytes—We previously demonstrated that PAR-1 activates ERK via an EGFR transactivation pathway in cardiac fibroblasts, but PAR-1 activates ERK via a distinct mechanism that does not require EGFR kinase activity in cardiomyocytes. Therefore, the next series of experiments examined whether Shc phosphorylation constitutes an additional cell-specific component of the PAR-1-ERK signaling pathway in the heart. Fig. 5 shows that neonatal cardiomyocyte cultures express all three Shc isoforms, that Tyr239/Tyr240-phosphorylation is detected only on p52Shc at rest, and that thrombin increases ERK phosphorylation without detectably increasing Shc-Tyr239/Tyr240 phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes. Control experiments show that EGF and H2O2 increase Shc-Tyr239/Tyr240 phosphorylation in this preparation. Although thrombin does not increase Shc-Tyr239/Tyr240 phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes, thrombin decreases the mobility of p66Shc (Fig. 5B). This effect is maximal at 5–10 min and wanes with longer incubation intervals. α1-AR activation with norepinephrine (NE) also leads to a subtle and transient p66Shc mobility shift; the mobility of p66Shc is markedly slowed by PMA. Fig. 5C shows that the thrombinand PMA-dependent p66Shc band shifts are abrogated by inhibitors of PKC (GF109203X) or MEK (U0126). Of note, AG1478 attenuates the thrombin-dependent p66Shc mobility shift in cardiac fibroblasts, but AG1478 does not block the thrombin-dependent p66Shc mobility shift in cardiomyocytes (compare Figs. 2B and 5C). Collectively, these results identify p66Shc phosphorylation downstream from the PAR-1-dependent ERK activation pathway, both in cardiac fibroblasts (where ERK activation is via EGFR transactivation) and in cardiomyocytes (where ERK is activated via an EGFR-independent mechanism). The studies next examined whether agonist-dependent p66Shc band shifts in cardiomyocytes can be attributed to p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation. Fig. 5D shows that thrombin modestly increases p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation and that stronger hypertrophic agonists, such as NE or PMA, induce even greater increases in p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation. Of note, at 30 min, NE increases p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation without significantly reducing the mobility of the protein (Fig. 5, compare B and D). These results indicate that a p66Shc band shift is not necessarily a reliable surrogate marker of p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation in all cell types. The importance of an agonist-dependent pathway leading to p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation is contingent upon the expression of the p66Shc isoform. In this context, Fig. 6 provides important evidence that p66Shc expression is highly regulated in cardiomyocytes. p66Shc immunoreactivity is quite prominent in neonatal cardiomyocyte cultures, in part because of the induction of p66Shc expression during cardiac culture (Fig. 6, compare lanes 5 and 6); p66Shc is detected at lower levels in post-natal day 2 ventricles (lane 3). In contrast, p66Shc is below the limits of detection in adult cardiac preparations (Fig. 6, lanes 2 and 4). These changes in p66Shc expression are paralleled by similar culture- and age-dependent changes in p46Shc expression. In contrast, p52Shc expression is similar in neonatal cardiomyocyte cultures and ventricle and only modestly reduced in the adult preparations. These results establish that p66Shc (like many other signaling proteins that regulate growth and apoptosis) is down-regulated during normal growth and maturation of the ventricle. Because many signaling proteins that are down-regulated during development are re-expressed during cardiac hypertrophy, we tested the hypothesis that hypertrophic agonists induce p66Shc expression. These studies took advantage of PMT, a direct activator of endogenous free monomeric Gαq subunits; we previously demonstrated that PMT activates PKC isoforms, stimulates ERK, and induces hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes (24.Sabri A. Wilson B.A. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Fig. 7A shows that PMT induces a marked increase in the abundance of p66Shc in association with the activation of ERK. PMT also increases p46Shc and p52Shc, although increases in p52Shc are best appreciated in gels with substantially reduced protein loading (data not shown). Fig. 7B shows that PMT also increases p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation in cardiomyocyte cultures to the high level observed in cultures acutely stimulated with PMA. In contrast, PMT triggers a modest increase in ERK activity without increasing Shc isoform expression in cardiac fibroblasts (not significant, n = 3). The PMT-dependent increase in p66Shc protein abundance is associated with an increase in ERK activity (Fig. 7A). NE, thrombin, EGF, and platelet-derived growth factor do not increase p66Shc or activate ERK under these experimental conditions. These results suggest that Shc expression might be regulated through the MEK-ERK pathway. Fig. 7C provides direct support for this conclusion by showing that the MEK inhibitor U0126 (as well as the PKC inhibitor GF109203X) completely abrogates the PMT-dependent increase in p66Shc expression. These studies implicate Shc isoforms as PAR-1-activated signaling proteins in the heart. We previously demonstrated that PAR-1 couples to an EGFR-dependent MEK-ERK activation pathway in cardiac fibroblasts. These studies identify p52Shc/p46Shc phosphorylation at Tyr239/Tyr240 and Tyr317 as components of this pathway. Although p66Shc shares considerable structural homology with p52Shc and p46Shc (i.e. p66Shc contains the tyrosines that are the targets for growth factor-dependent phosphorylation) and p66Shc is tyrosine-phosphorylated via direct EGFR activation by EGF, we identified little to no thrombin-induced p66Shc-tyrosine phosphorylation. Rather, we demonstrated that PAR-1 increases p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation via a mechanism involving EGFR transactivation of the MEK-ERK pathway in cardiac fibroblasts. Of note, thrombin also activates ERK and increases p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes, but this is not through an EGFR-dependent pathway and it is not associated with p52/p46Shc tyrosine phosphorylation. However, our results should not be construed as evidence that cardiomyocytes generally lack G protein-coupled receptor-dependent EGFR transactivation pathways leading to Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, because recent studies identify endothelin receptor-dependent activation of ERK via an EGFR transactivation pathway involving Shc tyrosine phosphorylation in cardiomyocyte cultures (25.Kodama H. Fukuda K. Takahashi T. Sano M. Kato T. Tahara S. Hakuno D. Sato T. Manabe T. Konishi F. Ogawa S. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 139-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Studies of the actions of thrombin in this manuscript emphasize the highly contextual nature of PAR-1 signaling in the heart (as schematized in Fig. 8) and the potential pitfalls in extrapolating results across cardiac cell models (or between surrogate model systems and physiologically relevant cell types in the heart). Early studies implicated p52/p46Shc phosphorylation events at both Tyr239/Tyr240 and Tyr317 in thrombin-dependent mitogenic responses (15.Ricketts W.A. Brown J.H. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1988-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The focus of most studies was on the similar roles of phospho-Tyr239/Tyr240 and phospho-Tyr317 as docking sites for the Grb2-SH2 domain (26.Gotoh N. Toyoda M. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1824-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, more recent literature suggests that these residues are functionally distinct, with Tyr317 coupling Shc to Fos-dependent activation of the Ras-ERK cascade and proliferation and Tyr239/Tyr240 coupling Shc to Myc-dependent survival pathways. There is evidence that phospho-Tyr239/Tyr240 might even be dispensable for EGFR-dependent Ras/ERK activation. However, it is worth noting that the consequences of Shc-Tyr239/Tyr240 and -Tyr317 phosphorylation generally have been inferred from studies that compare responses to high concentrations of growth factors in cells that heterologously overexpress wild-type or Tyr→ Phe-substituted Shc mutants. The relevance of these results to the controls and consequences of Tyr239/Tyr240 and Tyr317 phosphorylation events on native Shc isoforms responding to physiologic stimuli has been questioned (3.Ravichandran K.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6322-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Moreover, most studies have been predicated on the assumption that individual phosphorylation events on Shc serve distinct (rather than interdependent) functions. The recent observation that Tyr317 phosphorylation increases the structural rigidity of Shc (and decreases its affinity for binding partners such as the EGFR and protein phosphatase 2A) suggests that phosphorylation events at Tyr239/Tyr240 and Tyr317 impact on many aspects of the adapter function of Shc and play a more complex regulatory role in thrombin-dependent responses (27.Suenaga A. Kiyatkin A.B. Hatakeyama M. Futatsugi N. Okimoto N. Hirano Y. Narumi T. Kawai A. Susukita R. Koishi T. Furusawa H. Yasuoka K. Takada N. Ohno Y. Taiji M. Ebisuzaki T. Hoek J.B. Konagaya A. Kholodenko B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4657-4662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). p66Shc inhibits the growth-stimulatory effects of p46/p52Shc and also plays a distinctive role in oxidative stress responses through a mechanism that requires p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation. Studies to date have implicated kinase pathways involving MEK (that may or may not involve ERK) or stress-activated protein kinases (such as JNK and p38) in p66Shc-Ser/Thr phosphorylation, depending upon the cell type and inciting stimulus (28.Okada S. Kao A.W. Ceresa B.P. Blaikie P. Margolis B. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28042-28049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 29.Le S. Connors T.J. Maroney A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48332-48336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, many of the conclusions in the literature are based upon studies that track p66Shc mobility shifts. Although this technique provides a reliable readout of overall p66Shc-Ser/Thr phosphorylation, it does not distinguish phosphorylation events at individual Ser/Thr residues. Results reported herein suggest that it is not necessarily a valid surrogate for p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation, because the NE-dependent increase in p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes is associated with only a paltry p66Shc mobility shift. Conversely, thrombin induces an obvious p66Shc mobility shift in cardiomyocytes; the magnitude of the associated increase in p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation is modest in comparison. These results emphasize the importance of studies with PSSAs for unambiguous conclusions. To the best of our knowledge, studies reported herein are the first to directly link activation of a G protein-coupled receptor (PAR-1 in cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes, α1-ARs in cardiomyocytes) to p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation. The observation that p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation is a downstream target of a G protein-coupled receptor-activated pathway involving MEK identifies a novel mechanism to account for cardiac remodeling by MAPKs. Chronic catecholamine stimulation leads to molecular and structural remodeling of the ventricle and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of heart failure syndromes. To date, most studies have focused on catecholamine-triggered events that influence contraction, growth, and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes rather than the catecholamine-dependent mechanisms that act on interstitial fibroblasts. Our studies identify a β2-AR pathway involving EGFR transactivation that leads to ERK activation in neonatal cardiac fibroblast cultures. A similar EGFR transactivation pathway is reported to link β2-ARs to increased DNA synthesis in serially passaged adult cardiac fibroblasts (23.Kim J. Eckhart A.D. Eguchi S. Koch W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32116-32123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). At first glance, β2-ARs and PAR-1 might appear to share a similar EGFR transactivation-MEK-ERK pathway in cardiac fibroblasts. However, more detailed studies expose important differences that deserve emphasis. 1) β2-ARs promote a relatively modest increase in ERK activity via a PTX-sensitive pathway. PAR-1 induces a substantially more robust increase in ERK activity that is largely PTX-insensitive (and is presumably mediated by Gq and/or G12/13). Of note, β2-ARs induce a very robust increase in cAMP accumulation, whereas PAR-1 does not couple to cAMP accumulation in cardiac fibroblasts. A potential role for the cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway to limit β2-AR activation of ERK is the focus of ongoing studies. 2) The PAR-1-dependent EGFR transactivation pathway activates AKT; β2-ARs do not activate the anti-apoptotic AKT pathway under these conditions. 3) PAR-1-dependent EGFR transactivation leads to p46/p52Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation; β2-ARs activate ERK via a mechanism that does not require the adapter function of Shc and does not lead to p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation. These results suggest that PAR-1 and β2-ARs play very distinct roles in the control of cardiac fibroblast-induced ventricular remodeling. p52Shc is a ubiquitous protein detected in various cardiac cell preparations. In contrast, p66Shc is readily detected in neonatal cardiac preparations, but it is at the limits of detection in the adult ventricle. p66Shc is up-regulated by PMT (as part of a Gαq-dependent hypertrophy program) in neonatal cardiomyoytes, whereas PMT does not lead to a significant change in p66Shc expression in cardiac fibroblasts. These results are consistent with previous publications showing that Shc protein expression is prominent in the developing cardiovascular system during embryogenesis and that p66Shc is essentially undetectable in the adult ventricle. Of note, Cesselli et al. (13.Cesselli D. Jakoniuk I. Barlucchi L. Beltrami A.P. Hintze T.H. Nadal-Ginard B. Kajstura J. Leri A. Anversa P. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) previously identified increased p66Shc expression (in association with an increase in cardiomyocyte apoptosis) in the canine-pacing induced heart failure model. Future studies to determine whether hypertrophic stimuli (and/or pathologic insults) also induce p66Shc expression in adult rodent cardiomyocytes (and human hypertrophy and/or heart failure models) will be critical to assessing the functional relevance of the findings reported in this study performed on neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. In addition, it will be important to identify mechanisms that regulate p66Shc expression in the heart. In this regard, Ventura et al. (4.Ventura A. Luzi L. Pacini S. Baldari C.T. Pelicci P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22370-22376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) have reported that p66Shc expression is silenced through histone deacetylation and cytosine methylation. It is important to note that recent studies firmly implicate class II histone deacetylations as negative regulators of cardiac hypertrophy that can be neutralized by phosphorylation events triggered by Gαq-coupled receptors. Although preliminary experiments failed to identify an effect of the histone deacetylation inhibitor trichostatin A to increase p66Shc expression in cardiomyocyte cultures, the relative roles of histone acetylation and promoter methylation as mechanisms to up- or down-regulate p66Shc expression certainly deserve further scrutiny. There also is recent evidence that p38/MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of p66Shc at Ser54 and Thr386 leads to an increase in the stability of the protein and an increase in its abundance (30.Khanday, F. A., Yamamori, T., Mattagajasingh, I., Zhang, Z., Bugayenko, A., Naqvi, A., Santhanam, L., Nabi, N., Kasuno, K., Day, B. W., and Irani, K. (2005) Mol. Biol. CellGoogle Scholar). Either process could contribute to the Gαq-induced increase in p66Shc expression in cardiomyocytes. Finally, it is worth noting that this study implicates a MEK-ERK pathway in both the induction of p66Shc expression and the stimulus-induced increase in p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation. Studies to determine whether these MEK/ERK-dependent effects on p66Shc potentially undermine the otherwise protective effects of the MEK-ERK pathway are ongoing. There is ample evidence that the natural history of cardiac hypertrophy is to transition to heart failure, at least in part through mechanisms involving cardiomyocyte apoptosis. However, progress toward identifying the molecular signals that execute the apoptosis program in hypertrophied cardiomyocytes has been slow. We previously reported that persistent Gαq activation (by PMT) can result in enhanced cardiomyocyte susceptibility to apoptosis by repressing basal Akt phosphorylation and impairing Akt activation by survival factors (24.Sabri A. Wilson B.A. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These studies expose an alternative mechanism that is predicted to link Gαq stimulation to enhanced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and dilated cardiomyopathy involving an increase in p66Shc expression. This formulation is consistent with recent evidence that p66Shc localizes to mitochondria where it functions as a reactive oxygen species sensor (10.Orsini F. Migliaccio E. Moroni M. Contursi C. Raker V.A. Piccini D. Martin-Padura I. Pelliccia G. Trinei M. Bono M. Puri C. Tacchetti C. Ferrini M. Mannucci R. Nicoletti I. Lanfrancone L. Giorgio M. Pelicci P.G. J. Biol.

Mitochondrial events play particularly prominent roles in Gαq-dependent apoptosis (31.Adams J.W. Pagel A.L. Means C.K. Oksenberg D. Armstrong R.C. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). p66Shc, acting as a candidate hypertrophy-induced effector of the cardiomyocyte Gαq signaling pathway, provides an attractive novel molecular target for heart failure therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2134153708,"Alpha(v)beta8 integrin expression is restricted primarily to kidney, brain, and placenta. Targeted alpha(v) or beta8 deletion is embryonic lethal due to defective placenta and brain angiogenesis, precluding investigation of kidney alpha(v)beta8 function. We find that kidney beta8 is localized to glomerular mesangial cells, and expression is decreased in mouse models of glomerulosclerosis, suggesting that beta8 regulates normal mesangial cell differentiation. To interrogate beta8 signaling pathways, yeast two-hybrid and co-precipitation studies demonstrated beta8 interaction with Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor-1 (GDI). Selective beta8 stimulation enhanced beta8-GDI interaction as well as Rac1 (but not RhoA) activation and lamellipodia formation. Mesangial cells from itgb8-/- mice backcrossed to a genetic background that permitted survival, or gdi-/- mice, which develop glomerulosclerosis, demonstrated RhoA (but not Rac1) activity and alpha-smooth muscle actin assembly, which characterizes mesangial cell myofibroblast transformation in renal disease. To determine whether Rac1 directly modulates RhoA-associated myofibroblast differentiation, mesangial cells were transduced with inhibitory Rac peptide fused to human immunodeficiency virus-Tat, resulting in enhanced alpha-smooth muscle actin organization. We conclude that the beta8 cytosolic tail in mesangial cells organizes a signaling complex that culminates in Rac1 activation to mediate wild-type differentiation, whereas decreased beta8 activation shifts mesangial cells toward a RhoA-dependent myofibroblast phenotype."

These glycoproteins carry diacetamidobacillosamine (DAB), a sugar that is not found in humans. Hence, the enzymes responsible for DAB synthesis represent potential therapeutic targets. We describe the biochemical characterization of Cj1121c, a putative aminotransferase encoded by the general protein glycosylation locus, to assess its role in DAB biosynthesis. By using overexpressed and affinity-purified enzyme, we demonstrate that Cj1121c has pyridoxal phosphate- and glutamate-dependent UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-GlcNAc C-4 transaminase activity and produces UDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-GlcNAc. This is consistent with a role in DAB biosynthesis and distinguishes Cj1121c from Cj1294, a homologous UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-β-l-arabino-4-hexulose C-4 aminotransferase that we characterized previously. We show that Cj1121c can also use this 4-keto-arabino sugar indirectly as a substrate, that Cj1121c and Cj1294 are active simultaneously in C. jejuni, and that the activity of Cj1121c is preponderant under standard growth conditions. Kinetic data indicate that Cj1121c has a slightly higher catalytic efficiency than Cj1294 with regard to the 4-keto-arabino substrate. By site-directed mutagenesis, we show that residues Glu-158 and Leu-131 are not essential for catalysis or for substrate specificity contrary to expectations. We further demonstrate that a cj1121c knock-out mutant is impaired for flagella-mediated motility, for invasion of intestinal epithelial cells, and for persistence in the chicken intestine, clearly demonstrating that Cj1121c is essential for host colonization and virulence. Finally, we show that cj1121c is necessary for protein glycosylation by lectin Western blotting.

This bacterium is a commensal in poultry and cattle, and infection occurs mostly via ingestion of contaminated water or under-cooked poultry. The recent emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains has triggered renewed interest for the understanding of the pathogenesis of C. jejuni (2Engberg J. Aarestrup F.M. Taylor D.E. Gerner-Smidt P.

A direct role of the pgl operon in the synthesis of DAB was demonstrated by reconstituting the glycosylation of the C. jejuni protein PEB3 into an Escherichia coli strain that harbored a plasmid-borne pgl cluster (20Wacker M. Linton D. Hitchen P.G. Nita-Lazar M. Haslam S.M. North S.J. Panico M. Morris H.R. Dell A. Wren B.W. Aebi M. Science. 2002; 298: 1790-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Disruption of the pgl cluster in C. jejuni affects bacterial virulence, but its impact on protein glycosylation varies depending on the gene disrupted within the cluster, the strain of C. jejuni used, and the glycoprotein target examined. The effects range from incorporation of slightly different sugars in the glycoproteins to total abolition of glycoprotein production or to the absence of glycosylation (18Linton D. Dorrell N. Hitchen P.G. Amber S. Karlyshev A.V. Morris H.R. Dell A. Valvano M.A. Aebi M. Wren B.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1695-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 19Young N.M. Brisson J.R.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6508-6514Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).In addition to the glycoproteins whose glycosylation is encoded by the pgl operon, C. jejuni also produces glycosylated flagellins. The flagellins are glycosylated by pseudaminic acid (23Thibault P. Logan S.M. Kelly J.F. Brisson J.R. Ewing C.P. Trust T.J. Guerry P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34862-34870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and the gene cj1293, which is not part of the pgl cluster, is important for this process. Disruption of cj1293 prevents flagellin glycosylation, thus preventing the assembly of the flagellum (21Goon S. Kelly J.F. Logan S.M. Ewing C.P. Guerry P. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), an essential virulence factor. Overall, because protein glycosylation is essential for bacterial virulence, the sugar-nucleotide-modifying enzymes involved in the synthesis of the sugars dedicated to protein glycosylation represent potential targets for the development of inhibitors with therapeutic value. Their biochemical characterization is a prerequisite in the quest for potential inhibitors.The biochemical pathway for the biosynthesis of DAB has not been elucidated, but we surmised that it should contain three steps including C-6 dehydration of UDP-GlcNAc, C-4 transamination of the resulting 4-keto intermediate, and final N-acetylation to generate UDP-DAB (Fig. 1). We have demonstrated that Cj1293 has UDP-GlcNAc C-6 dehydratase activity and generates UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-GlcNAc (24Creuzenet C. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recent data indicate that, in addition to UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-GlcNAc, Cj1293 also generates UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-β-l-arabino-4-hexulose (25Schoenhofen I.C. McNally D.J. Vinogradov E. Whitfield D. Young N.M. Dick S. Wakarchuk W.W. Brisson J.R. Logan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) via a change of chirality at carbon 5 during the dehydration step. Structural studies of a homologous enzyme from Helicobacter pylori, FlaA1, indicate that the formation of the 4-keto-arabino intermediate is enzymatically catalyzed but that of the 4-keto-gluco intermediate is not and occurs via enolization of a double bond between C-4 and C-5 (26Ishiyama N. Creuzenet C. Miller W.L. Demendi M. Anderson E.M. Harauz G. Lam J.S. Berghuis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The cj1293 gene is part of an operon that also encodes an aminotransferase (Cj1294) and a putative N-acetyltransferase (Cj1298). We have demonstrated that Cj1294 is a C-4 aminotransferase that uses the reaction product generated by Cj1293 as a substrate, which was the very first aminotransferase with such substrate specificity to be characterized (27Obhi R.K. Creuzenet C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20902-20908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Not suspecting that a change of chirality occurred during dehydration, we had determined previously by NMR that Cj1294 generated UDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-GalNAc (27Obhi R.K. Creuzenet C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20902-20908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which is not a DAB precursor. By taking the change of chirality at C-5 into account, the NMR assignments had to be revisited so that the reaction product of Cj1294 is UDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-β-l-AltNAc (Fig. 1). This product is not consistent either with the formation of DAB in which the sugar ring is in the gluco-configuration.The pgl cluster also potentially encodes for the three biochemical activities necessary for DAB biosynthesis, namely including Cj1120c as the dehydratase, Cj1121c as the aminotransferase, and Cj1123c as the N-acetyltransferase. Because no biochemical data were available at onset of this work, it was reasonable to assume that Cj1120c had at least the same UDP-GlcNAc C-6 dehydratase activity as Cj1293. This was based on the fact that both enzymes are highly similar to one another (30% identity) and are also highly similar to two other UDP-GlcNAc C-6 dehydratases that we characterized previously, FlaA1 from H. pylori (28% identity with Cj1120c) and WbpM from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35% identity with Cj1120c) (28Creuzenet C. Schur M.J. Li J. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34873-34880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Creuzenet C. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1295-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).We undertook the biochemical characterization of the putative aminotransferase Cj1121c to determine whether it had a distinct activity from Cj1294 and could be involved in the DAB biosynthetic pathway. Using overexpressed and purified Cj1121c, we demonstrate that Cj1121c is indeed a C-4 aminotransferase that uses UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-GlcNAc as a substrate in a glutamate- and pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent fashion. We showed that it produces UDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-GlcNAc, which is distinct from the reaction product of Cj1294, and is consistent with a role of Cj1121c in DAB biosynthesis. We also report on the characterization of a cj1121c knock-out mutant with regard to protein glycosylation, motility, flagellum synthesis, interactions with epithelial cells, and colonization of chicken intestinal tract. Our data clearly establish a role for cj1121c in bacterial virulence. This, together with our biochemical characterization, opens the way for therapeutic development.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Growth Conditions—All E. coli strains (DH5α, BL21(DE3)pLys) were routinely grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani broth, with agitation. Selection with 100 μg/ml ampicillin or 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol was applied as necessary.C. jejuni strain ATCC 700819 was typically grown under microaerophilic conditions for 48 h on Mueller-Hinton (MH) plates containing 10 μg/ml vancomycin and 5 μg/ml trimethoprim, as well as 0.05% pyruvate and 5% fetal calf serum.Cloning of cj1121c in the pET System for Overexpression— The cj1121c gene was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of C. jejuni strain ATCC 700819 using Expand Long Range Template polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The primers used were Cj1121cP5 AGGGTCCATGGGCATGAGATTTTTTCTTTCTCC and Cj1121cP6 GCGTCGGATCCTAAGCCTTTATGCTCTTTAA, which were designed based on genomic data (30Parkhill J. Wren B.W. Mungall K.

The PCR product was blunted and cloned into the SmaI site of the pUC18 vector using standard procedures. The cj1121c gene was then extracted from the pUC18 vector by digestion with NcoI and BamHI and inserted into a pET23 derivative (31Newton D.T. Mangroo D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that had been cleaved previously with the same enzymes. After transformation in E. coli DH5α and selection on 100 μg/ml ampicillin, the plasmid DNA was recovered, and the gene was fully sequenced. Sequencing was performed at the Robarts DNA sequencing facility (London, Ontario, Canada).Protein Overexpression and Purification—Protein expression was done in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLys with cells grown at 25 °C and induction overnight at 25 °C with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. The harvested cells were kept at –20 °C until needed. The enzyme purification was performed by metal chelation as described before (27Obhi R.K. Creuzenet C. J. Biol.

The enzyme was used extemporaneously for all kinetic experiments. Otherwise, it was kept frozen at –20 °C in the presence of 20% glycerol. Expression and purification of Cj1293 and Cj1294 were performed as described previously (24Creuzenet C. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27Obhi R.K.

SDS-PAGE analysis and Western blotting with anti-histidine antibody (Amersham Biosciences) were done according to standard procedures.Enzyme Assays with Purified Enzymes—Typical enzymatic reactions contained 0.12 μg of Cj1293 and 0.8 μg of Cj1121c with 0.5 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 10 mm glutamic acid (or other amino acid), and 0.1 mm PLP (for fractions not preincubated with PLP at the end of the purification) in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, in a final volume of 20 μl. Catalysis was assessed by capillary electrophoresis (CE) as described before (28Creuzenet C. Schur M.J. Li J. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol.

For the determination of kinetic parameters, fresh 4-keto-arabino intermediate was prepared using UDP-GlcNAc and Cj1293, and the Cj1293 enzyme was removed by ultrafiltration (Pall Life Sciences, 10-kDa cutoff). Appropriate serial dilutions of this 4-keto stock were used to assess enzymatic activity at 11 different concentrations centered around the expected Km value. Experiments were performed in triplicate.Purification of the Reaction Product by Anion Exchange Chromatography—The purification of the reaction product was performed by anion exchange chromatography using a High Q Econopac 1-ml column (Bio-Rad) and a linear gradient (50 mm to 1 m) of 20 column volumes of triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5. The fractions were checked for the presence of the product of interest by CE, pooled together, and lyophilized.Identification of the Reaction Product—The reactivity of the purified reaction product with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) was tested by incubating it with a 20 m excess of TNBS in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, for 1 h at 50°C. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of the reaction product was performed at the Don Rix MS facility of the University of Western Ontario on a Micromass Qtof Micromass spectrometer equipped with a Z-spray source operating in the negative ion mode (40 V, 80 °C). NMR analyses were performed at the University of Western Ontario NMR facility as described before (27Obhi R.K. Creuzenet C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20902-20908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Construction of C. jejuni cj1294 and cj1121c Knock-out Mutants—Inverse PCR was performed on the cj1294 or cj1121c genes that had been previously cloned into the pET vector (27Obhi R.K. Creuzenet C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20902-20908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using primers Cj1294P3 (GTGGGTACCAACTCGATCACAATCTTGA) and Cj1294P4 (ATGCTAGGGCCCTCTACCACGCTAATAGCT) for cj1294, and primers Cj1121cP8 (GTCATCGGGCCCTAAAGCTTCAGCAGCATC) and Cj1121cP7 (ACAAGAATGCGGCCGCAAATGGAGGTTTTAGAACAA) for cj1121c. A chloramphenicol resistance cassette was PCR-amplified from the pRYIII vector (33Yao R. Alm R.A. Trust T.J. Guerry P. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 130: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) using primers CATCOLIP3 (GTCATCGGGCCCTTCCTTTCCAAGTTAATTGC) and CATCOLIP2 (GTCGGTACCTTATTTATTCAGCAAGTCTTG) for preparation of the cj1294 mutant and CATCOLIP3 and CATCOLIP4 (ACAAGAATGCGGCCGCTTATTTATTCAGCAAGTCTTG) for preparation of the cj1121c mutant. After digestion with ApaI and KpnI (for cj1294) or ApaI and NotI (for cj1121c), both PCR fragments (cat cassette and gene of interest) were ligated together to generate each disrupted gene. The disrupted genes were re-amplified using primers Cj1294P1 (AGGGTACATCTCCATGCTTACTTATTCTCATCA) and Cj1294P2 (GCGTCGGATCCTTATCCACAATATCCCTTTTT) and Cj1121cP1 (CGGGATCCATGAGATTTTTTCTTTCTCC) and Cj1121cP2 (GAAGATCTTAAGCCTTTATGCTCTTTA), cut with AflIII and BamHIII for cj1294 and BglII and BamHIII for cj1121c, and ligated to C. jejuni chromosomal DNA that had been cut with the same enzymes. The DNA was introduced into C. jejuni by natural transformation with 0.03% saponin using the biphasic method (9Nuijten P.J. Bleumink-Pluym N.M. Gaastra W. van der Zeijst B.A. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1084-1088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34van Vliet A.H.M. Wood A.C. Henderson J. Wooldridge K. Ketley J.M. Methods Microbiol. 1998; 27: 407-419Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). After selection on 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol, candidate mutants were checked by PCR and Southern blotting.Growth Rates of C. jejuni—To assess growth rates, C. jejuni, wild-type or mutant, was inoculated in MH broth in Klett flasks at an A600 nm of 0.1, and growth was monitored for 16 h using a Klett Summerson photoelectric colorimeter.Enzyme Assays Using C. jejuni Cell Extracts—C. jejuni cell pellets (representing ∼100 μl of wet cells) were resuspended in ice-cold “breaking buffer” (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) and ∼50 μl of acid-washed glass beads (Sigma) were added to the suspension. The cells were lysed by vigorous vortexing (three times for 30 s). The suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min to remove unlysed cells and glass beads. The total protein concentration of the supernatants was measured using the Bio-Rad protein determination assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. All supernatants from each series were then diluted at an equal protein concentration in breaking buffer for enzyme assays.A typical enzyme assay included 9.6 μl of supernatant, 0.5 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 0.12 μg of Cj1293, 10 mm glutamate, and 0.1 mm PLP in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Enzymatic activity was stopped by snap freezing at –80 °C. The samples were analyzed by CE as described before.Production of the E158H and L131F Mutants of Cj1121c— Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Quik-Change mutagenesis procedure (Stratagene) except that the iProof™ High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Bio-Rad) was used, and six cycles of PCR were performed using each primer independently before pooling the reactions and allowing the PCR to resume for 19 more cycles as described previously (35Demendi M. Ishiyama N. Lam J.S. Berghuis A.M. Creuzenet C. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The primers used were CATTGATTTTAACTCATTTTTATGGCAATGCG and CGCATTGCCATAAAAATGAGTTAAAATCAATG for E158H, and CGAAGATGCTGCTCATGCTTTAGGAAGTTT and CTTCCTAAAGCATGAGCAGCATCTTCG for L131F. The sequences introducing the mutated codons are underlined. The PCR conditions were 5 min at 98 °C, followed by 25 cycles (30 s at 98 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C) and a final elongation of 7 min at 72 °C. The sample was treated with DpnI (Stratagene) to eliminate native methylated plasmid DNA, and the PCR product was transformed into E. coli DH5α with selection on 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The plasmids extracted from independent clones were sequenced using the T7 promoter primer and primer CACTTCAGGTGGAGGTATGCT (internal to cj1121c) to check for the exclusive presence of the desired mutations. Protein expression and purification, as well as activity assays, were performed as described above for the wild-type protein.Motility Assays—C. jejuni were grown for 24 h on MH plates, harvested in MH broth, and adjusted to A600 nm of 0.2. Motility plates (0.3% agar in MH) were stabbed in triplicate with the wild-type or cj1121c mutant and incubated for 36–48 h under microaerophilic conditions at 37 °C. The diameter of the motility halo was monitored over time.Flagellin Analyses—Flagellins were extracted by glycine extraction (0.2 m glycine, pH 2.2, for 10 min at room temperature) and run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel with detection by Ponceau S staining or Western immunoblot using an antiflagellin antibody as described before (36Merkx-Jacques A. Obhi R.K. Bethune G. Creuzenet C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2253-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The presence or absence of flagella was also monitored by electron microscopy by negative staining with 2% ammonium molybdate. EM was done in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Western Ontario.Tissue Culture Experiments—Caco-2 cells were grown for 3 days until they formed a confluent monolayer (∼650,000 cells per well in 24-well plates) and were fully differentiated, as determined by measuring the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate in a standard colorimetric assay (detection at 405 nm) (37Kucerova D. Stokrova J. Korb J. Sloncova E. Tuhackova Z. Sovova V. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 10: 779-784PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were infected for 5 h with wild-type or mutant C. jejuni that had been grown for 48 h in tryptic soy broth (Oxoid) medium. Approximately 6.5 × 107 cfu of C. jejuni were added, resulting in a multiplicity of infection of 1 Caco-2 cell per 100 bacteria. The plates were spun briefly (500 × g for 5 min at room temperature) to maximize contact between the bacteria and the cell monolayer. To determine total bacterial cell association (adhering and internalized bacteria), Caco-2 cell monolayers were washed three times, lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and viable bacterial counts determined by plating serial dilutions. To determine the number of internalized bacteria, the Caco-2 cell monolayers were treated with 200 μg/ml gentamycin for 2 h to kill extracellular bacteria. The cells were then washed and treated as above to determine bacterial viable counts. Three independent sets of experiments were done, with triplicates within each experiment. The data represent the average of all experiments.Chicken Colonization Assays—For chicken infections, C. jejuni was grown on tryptic soy agar plates containing 5% sheep blood under microaerophilic conditions at 42 °C for 24 h. Cells from plates were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, adjusted to an A600 nm of 0.2 (∼109 cfu/ml), and diluted 1:100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Two-day-old White Leghorn specific pathogen-free chicks were orally administered 100 μl (106 cfu) of either the C. jejuni wild-type strain or the cj1121c mutant. Five days later, chicks were euthanized, and the caeca and their contents were harvested, weighed, and homogenized. Viable counts were obtained from serial dilutions of samples that were plated on Campylobacter-selective medium plates (Quélab Inc., Montreal, Canada) for 48 h.Analysis of Protein Glycosylation by SBA Western Blotting— C. jejuni wild-type and cj1121c mutant cell pellets were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred onto nitrocellulose using standard procedures. Detection was performed by staining with Ponceau S red"

In the Tat systems of Escherichia coli and many other species TatA-, TatB-, and TatC-like proteins have been identified as essential translocase components. In contrast, the Bacillus subtilis phosphodiesterase PhoD-specific system consists only of a pair of TatAd/TatCd proteins and involves a TatAd protein engaged in a cytosolic and a membrane-embedded localization.

Initially, the Tat pathway was discovered in chloroplasts as a pathway that operates independently of soluble factors and nucleoside triphosphates and is exclusively energized by the proton gradient across the membrane (7.Cline K.

TatCs are a family of proteins with six calculated transmembrane-spanning domains with N and C termini exposed to the cytoplasmic or stromal side of the membrane (4.Wu L.F. Ize B. Chanal A.

These changes involve a TatA, the C terminus of which shuttles between the cytosol and the periplasmic space, and a TatC, the predicted fourth and fifth transmembrane helices of which shuttle in the periplasmic space. They speculated that this topology of TatC might reflect an operational state of TatC that changes during the protein translocation process (21.Gouffi K. Gerard F. Santini C.L. Wu L.F. J. Biol.

The current proposal for the action of Tat transport system of E. coli and plant thylakoids involves the initial binding of substrates to the TatB-TatC high molecular weight complex mediated via a direct contact of the double arginine signal peptide with TatC (20.Mori H.

The signal peptide binding triggers association with TatA to form the active translocation channel driven by the transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient. The folded substrate protein is translocated across the membrane through a channel formed by multiple TatA protomers (recently reviewed in Refs. 23.Palmer T. Berks B.C.

We have demonstrated that the tatAd and tatCd genes, co-localized with phoD in one operon, were essential and sufficient to export PhoD (29.Pop O. Martin U. Abel C. Muller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3268-3273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The second copy of tatC (tatCy) was not required for PhoD export (26.Jongbloed J.D. Martin U.

TatCy obviously forms together with TatAy a second TatAC translocase mediating the export of YwbN (30.Jongbloed J.D. Grieger U. Antelmann H. Hecker M. Nijland R. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 1319-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). TatAd is engaged in a dual localization. Despite the fact that the protein has a calculated N-terminal membrane-spanning α-helical region, TatAd was also found in the cytosol where it specifically interacted with the twin arginine motif of the prePhoD signal peptide (31.Pop O.I. Westermann M. Volkmer-Engert R. Schulz D. Lemke C. Schreiber S. Gerlach R. Wetzker R. Muller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38428-38436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A similar observation has been recently reported for TatA and TatB proteins of the Streptomyces lividans Tat system (32.De Keersmaeker S. Van Mellaert L. Lammertyn E. Vrancken K. Anne J. Geukens N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33.De Keersmaeker S. Van Mellaert L. Schaerlaekens K. Van Dessel W. Vrancken K. Lammertyn E. Anne J.

The ability of soluble Tat proteins to posttranslationally bind Tat-dependent preproteins resulted in speculation that a soluble population of these Tat proteins could serve to recruit the substrates to the translocase. The prerequisite to confirm this thesis would be a definite cross-talk of the substrate-Tat protein complex with the membrane-integrated part of the translocase. To prove a possible targeting function of TatAd for its substrate, we studied its affinity for TatCd. Because soluble TatAd was able to bind the twin arginine signal peptide of prePhoD prior to membrane integration, it could mediate the recruitment of the substrates to the membrane via the interaction with TatCd. By analyzing the distribution of TatAd and studying the mutual affinity with TatCd in different cellular systems we have shown here that TatCd assists the membrane localization of TatAd. Detergent-solubilized TatCd as well as membrane-integrated TatCd showed specific affinity for soluble TatAd. By analyzing the affinity of TatAd for a peptide library of TatCd, a specific binding to intermembrane cytosolic loops of TatCd was demonstrated. In addition, depletion of TatCd in B. subtilis resulted in a reduction of TatAd, indicating a stabilizing effect of TatCd for TatAd. Further, the presence of the substrate prePhoD affected distribution of TatAd and was the prerequisite for appropriate membrane insertion. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Media—E. coli strain TG1(pREP4) (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used to overexpress proteins. Plasmids pQE9tatAd, pQE60tatCd, and pQE9phoDp have been described elsewhere (29.Pop O. Martin U. Abel C. Muller J.P. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6097-6104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As required, medium was supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (40 μg/ml), and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 1 mm). The shuttle plasmids pREP9tatAd/tatCd or pREP9tatAd mediate the IPTG-inducible expression of tatAd and tatCd or tatAd in B. subtilis and E. coli (31.Pop O.I. Westermann M. Volkmer-Engert R. Schulz D.

B. subtilis strains were grown in TY medium to mid-exponential phase, and expression of tat genes was induced with 1 mm IPTG. To induce the phoD-tatAd-tatCd operon, B. subtilis strains were grown in low phosphate defined medium (35.Müller J.P. An Z. Merad T. Hancock I.C. Harwood C.R. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Induction of phosphate starvation response was monitored by determining alkaline phosphatase activity as described previously (36.Hulett F.M. Bookstein C. Jensen K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 735-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane-free cell extracts of B. subtilis and E. coli were prepared as described (31.Pop O.I. Westermann M. Volkmer-Engert R. Schulz D.

Purification of His6-tagged Proteins—His6-TatAd, TatCd-His6, and His6-prePhoD were purified using E. coli strains TG1(pREP4, pQE9tatAd), TG1(pREP4, pQE60tatCd), and TG1(pREP4, pQE9phoDp) as described (31.Pop O.I. Westermann M. Volkmer-Engert R. Schulz D. Lemke C. Schreiber S. Gerlach R. Wetzker R. Muller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38428-38436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Membrane-embedded TatAd was purified in the presence of 8 m urea under denaturing conditions according to standard protocols when indicated. In Vivo Labeling of His-TatAd—[35S]Met-labeled His6-TatAd was obtained by pulse labeling of E. coli TG1(pREP4, pQE9tatAd) cultures. The strain was grown in M9 minimal medium, expression of tatAd was induced for 15 min, and cultures were labeled with 50 μCi of [35S]methionine for 5 min. Subsequent purification using Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography was carried out essentially as described above. Freeze-Fracture Electron Microscopy—Liposomes were concentrated by centrifugation and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 15% (w/v) glycerol. Aliquots were enclosed between two 0.1-mm copper profiles as used for the sandwich double-replica technique. The sandwiches were rapidly frozen by plunging them into liquid propane cooled by liquid nitrogen. Freeze fracturing was performed in a BAF400T (BAL-TEC, Liechtenstein) freeze-fracture unit at –150 °C using a double-replica stage. The fractured samples were shadowed without etching with 2.0–2.5 nm of platinum/carbon at an angle of 35°. The evaporation of platinum/carbon with electron guns was controlled by a thin layer quartz crystal monitor. Fracture Labeling of TatAd—For freeze-fracture immunogold labeling and subsequent electron microscopy, the freeze-fracture replicas were transferred to a digesting solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, containing 30 mm sucrose and 2.5% SDS) and incubated overnight according to Fujimoto (37.Fujimoto K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 107: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The replicas were washed four times in PBS buffer and treated with PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Next, they were placed in PBS containing bovine serum albumin (0.5%) and monospecific antibodies against TatAd (dilution 1:20) for 1 h. Subsequently the replicas were washed four times with PBS and placed on a 1:50 diluted solution of the secondary gold-conjugated antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG with 10 nm gold particles; British Biocell International, Cardiff, UK) in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. After immunogold labeling, the replicas were immediately rinsed several times in PBS, fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, washed four times in distilled water, and finally picked onto Formvar-filmed copper grids for viewing in an EM 902 electron microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Freeze-fracture micrographs were mounted with direction of shadowing from bottom to top. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Protein SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was prepared as described by Laemmli (38.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schüll) as described by Towbin et al. (39.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized using monospecific antibodies against TatAd, TatCd, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolation of Inverted Membrane Vesicles—E. coli cells producing the TatCd, TatAd, and TatCd, B. subtilis SecYEG (40.Swaving J. Van Wely K.H. Driessen A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7021-7027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or no Tat proteins were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The cell suspension was passed three times through a French press at 16,000 lb/in2 to obtain inside-out inner membrane vesicles (IMVs), and the cell debris was removed by low spin centrifugation (10,000 × g for 5 min). Membranes were collected by high spin centrifugation (200,000 × g, 1 h) and resuspended in buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol; the inner membranes were subsequently separated from the outer membranes by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (41.van der Does C. den Blaauwen T. de Wit J.G. Manting E.H. Groot N.A. Fekkes P. Driessen A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). IMVs were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Protein content was determined by the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). TatAd Binding to IMVs—For TatAd binding reactions, IMVs were resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 30 mm KCl, 0.5 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm magnesium acetate) and incubated for 15 min on ice with various amounts of [35S]Met-labeled His6-TatAd and nonlabeled His6-TatAd as indicated in the figures. Samples were subsequently loaded on a sucrose cushion (0.25 mm sucrose in binding buffer) and fractionated by centrifugation (10 min, 30 lb/in2 in a Beckman Airfuge at room temperature). The amounts of [35S]Met-labeled His6-TatAd in the supernatant and in the pellet were quantified with a γ counter. Stability Determination of TatAd—B. subtilis strains were grown to mid-exponential growth phase in TY medium. Plasmid-mediated expression of tatAd was induced with IPTG (final concentration 1 mm). After 1 h further protein synthesis was stopped by addition of tetracycline (12.5 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml). Cells were withdrawn, lysed, and equalized for identical protein content. TatAd in total cell extracts was detected immunologically using SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting. Relative TatAd level was estimated by quantification of chemiluminescence-labeled protein. Synthesis and Screening of the Cellulose-bound Peptide Arrays—Peptide arrays were prepared by automated spot synthesis using the AMS SPOT robot (Abimed, Langenfeld, Germany) (42.Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 43.Wenschuh H. Volkmer-Engert R. Schmidt M. Schulz M. Schneider-Mergener J. Reineke U. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 188-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Before screening, the membranes were washed in methanol for 10 min and three times in TBS buffer (50 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 27 mm KCl, pH 8.0) and subsequently incubated in blocking buffer (10% GENOSYS SU-07-250; 5% sucrose, TBST buffer (TBS with 0.05% Tween)) for 3 h. After washing with TBST buffer, the peptide arrays were incubated with [35S]Met-labeled His6-TatAd (50 ng/ml; 10,000 cpm/μl) in blocking buffer for 16 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. Unbound protein was washed out with TBST buffer. Relative amounts of radioactivity were estimated by using phosphorimaging (Fuji) and associated image analytical software PC-BAS. Mutual Interaction of TatAd and TatCd—Affinity of the particular Tat proteins has been extensively investigated for E. coli as well as in plant Tat systems (44.Bolhuis A. Mathers J.E. Thomas J.D.

Because functionality of the B. subtilis TatAd/TatCd transport system was demonstrated in E. coli (29.Pop O. Martin U. Abel C. Muller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3268-3273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we assumed the formation of a functional transport unit in this host. To study the interaction of B. subtilis TatAd/TatCd proteins, we analyzed their mutual affinity in E. coli. His6-TatAd was amplified simultaneously with the untagged translocase proteins TatAd/TatCd using E. coli TG1(pQE9tatAd, pREP9tatAd/tatCd). Cells were harvested, and release of membrane-integrated proteins was obtained by lysing cells in phosphate buffer containing 0.5% octyl glucoside. His6-TatAd was immobilized on Ni2+-NTA superflow-agarose from membrane-free cell extracts. After removal of unbound material His6-TatAd was eluted with imidazole (250 mm) and assayed for retained TatCd. As demonstrated in Fig. 1A, lane 1, His6-TatAd eluate contained untagged TatCd. A reciprocal experiment was carried out by using TatCd-His6 as bait protein. E. coli strain TG1(pQE60tatCd, pREP9tatAd/tatCd) produces TatCd-His6 in addition to the untagged translocase proteins TatAd/TatCd. TatCd-His6 was purified and immobilized on Ni2+-NTA superflow-agarose as described above and analyzed for retained TatAd using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1B, lane 1, TatCd-His6 retained untagged TatAd co-expressed in the same cells. As control, strain TG1(pREP9tatAd/tatCd) was processed under essentially identical conditions. In this case neither TatAd nor TatCd was retained at the column material (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 2). To optimize release of Tat proteins from the bacterial membrane, octyl glucoside was replaced by dodecyl maltoside or Triton X-100. Essentially similar co-purification of the untagged protein could be observed by its His6-tagged translocase partner protein (data not shown). TatCd Has Affinity for Soluble TatAd—Based on our previous data TatAd is found, in addition to its expected membrane localization, soluble in the cytosol both in B. subtilis and in E. coli, where it specifically interacted with its substrate prePhoD (31.Pop O.I. Westermann M. Volkmer-Engert R. Schulz D. Lemke C. Schreiber S. Gerlach R. Wetzker R. Muller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38428-38436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To assist substrate transport, TatAd should interact with specific receptor sites at the membrane surface. A possible candidate is the membrane-embedded TatCd. To investigate this thesis, affinity of TatAd to TatCd was analyzed using immobilized purified TatCd. Therefore, TatCd-His6 was overexpressed in and subsequently purified from E. coli TG1(pREP4, pQE60tatCd) using Ni2+-NTA superflow-agarose in the presence of 0.5% octyl glucoside. TatCd-His6-loaded agarose beads were incubated with membrane-free cell extracts derived from B. subtilis 168(pREP9tatAd/tatCd) cells producing soluble TatAd (Fig. 1C, lane 2). After removal of unbound material, TatAd was co-eluted with TatCd-His6 from the column material (Fig. 1C, lane 3). As a control experiment Ni2+-NTA superflow-agarose was incubated with cell lysate of E. coli TG1, washed, and incubated with membrane-free cell extracts of B. subtilis 168(pREP9tatAd/tatCd) (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 5). Because here no TatAd remained bound to the beads (Fig. 1C, lane 6), it can be concluded that soluble TatAd was retained via its interaction with immobilized TatCd-His6. Membrane-localized TatCd Has Affinity for Soluble TatAd—To circumvent experimental artifacts due to the detergent-mediated extraction of TatCd from the membrane, we studied the ability of membrane-localized TatCd to bind TatAd. IMVs were prepared from E. coli TG1(pREP4, pQE60tatCd) and then incubated with [35S]Met-labeled and purified soluble His6-TatAd. IMVs bearing overexpressed TatCd supported significantly higher binding of [35S]Met-labeled soluble His6-TatAd compared with that of the control IMVs (Fig. 2A, lane 1). [35S]Met-labeled TatAd binding was effectively reduced nearly to the background level by the addition of a 50-fold excess of nonlabeled TatAd (Fig. 2A, lane 4). Relative high background binding of TatAd to the IMVs was due to unspecific binding as shown by TatAd binding to liposomes (data not shown). In contrast, it was not possible to discern specific binding to any of the SecYEG components of the B. subtilis Sec translocase unit (data not shown). If IMVs were produced from E. coli TG1(pREP4, pQE9tatAd/tatCd) simultaneously producing TatAd and TatCd, lower levels of specific binding of [35S]Met-labeled TatAd were observed compared with IMVs containing TatCd only (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Increasing amounts of [35S]Met-labeled TatAd reduced the rate of binding for TatCd, the same as for TatAd/TatCd-containing IMVs (Fig. 2B). It was concluded that TatAd specifically binds to TatCd, which provides a limited number of receptor sites at the surface of the membrane. Distribution of TatAd Depends on the Presence of TatCd—Having established that TatCd provides receptor sites for TatAd at the membrane, we next investigated its influence on the distribution of"
https://openalex.org/W2033961481,"The voltage-gated Kv2.1 channel is composed of four identical subunits folded around the central pore and does not inactivate appreciably during short depolarizing pulses. To study voltage-induced relative molecular rearrangements of the channel, Kv2.1 subunits were genetically fused with enhanced cyan fluorescent protein and/or enhanced yellow fluorescent protein, expressed in COS1 cells, and investigated using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy combined with patch clamp. Fusion of fluorophores to either or both termini of the Kv2.1 monomer did not significantly affect the gating properties of the channel. FRET between the N- and C-terminal tags fused to the same or different Kv2.1 monomers decreased upon activation of the channel by depolarization from -80 to +60 mV, suggesting voltage-gated relative rearrangement between the termini. Because FRET between the Kv2.1 N- or C-terminal tags and the membrane-trapped EYFPN-PH pleckstrin homology domains did not change on depolarization, voltage-gated relative movements between the Kv2.1 termini occurred in a plane parallel to the plasma membrane, within a distance of 1-10 nm. FRET between the N-terminal tags did not change upon depolarization, indicating that the N termini do not rearrange relative to each other, but they could either move cooperatively with the Kv2.1 tetramer or not move at all. No FRET was detected between the C-terminal tags. Assuming their randomized orientation in the symmetrically arranged Kv2.1 subunits, C termini may move outwards in order to produce relative rearrangements between N and C termini upon depolarization.

Voltage-activated K+ channels are a large and diverse family of homotetrameric membrane proteins that are similar in their ability to select for K+ over other ions but show differences in kinetics and voltage dependence of activation and inactivation (1Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 91-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Each of the Kvα subunits is assembled into six transmembrane domains that encode determinants of voltage sensing and ion selectivity. The N and C termini are located in the cytoplasm and support a number of important interactions. The N-terminal tetramerization (T1) domain determines the specificity of assembly of Kvα subunits (2Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

The crystal structure of the T1 domain is known and forms a tetramer below the membrane like a “hanging gondola” (7Kobertz W.R. Williams C. Miller C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10347-10352Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), while the C-terminal domain surrounds this N-terminal structure (8Sokolova O. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Grigorieff N. Structure. 2001; 9: 215-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). There are voltage-dependent interactions between the N terminus and the C terminus that are important determinants of channel activation and modulate the activation time course of Kvα channels (6Minor D.L.

Science. 2005; 309: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar) provided insight into the folding of the N terminus fragment of Kv1.2 and suggested potentially important association between the gating and C terminus. However, the size and direction of rearrangements that may occur upon gating in the large cytoplasmic regions of Kvα channels and their functional significance are poorly understood; in fact, movement of these regions during potassium channel gating and opening has not been directly shown previously. Furthermore, if such movement of the N- and (or) C-terminal intracellular regions does occur, it is not clear whether these regions move in a coordinated manner. Recent efforts to characterize such rearrangements in Ca2+ and K+ channels have centered on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) 2The abbreviations used are: FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; NFRET, normalized corrected FRET; Vh, holding potential; PH, pleckstrin homology. 2The abbreviations used are: FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; NFRET, normalized corrected FRET; Vh, holding potential; PH, pleckstrin homology. microscopy (14Kobrinsky E.

Voltage-gated Kv2.1 channels generate slowly activating outward K+ currents that control excitability of neuronal and endocrine cells by participating in repolarization of action potentials. The strength of our approach is that the measurements were conducted together with simultaneous electrophysiological recordings in the live cell under voltage clamp conditions in real time. The analysis of our data is considerably simplified because the Kv2.1 potassium channel does not show inactivation when expressed in COS cells or oocytes (17Wilson G.G. Oneill C.A. Sivaprasadarao A. Findlay J.B.C. Wray D. Pflugers Arch. 1994; 428: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (18Murakoshi H. Shi G. Scannevin R.H. Trimmer J.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). N-type inactivation is not present, as the channel lacks an N-terminal ball that would have produced complicating movements involving inactivation. Also, C-type inactivation is not prominent in the Kv2.1 channel, at least over the time scales studied here.Amino acids 67 and 75 of the N-terminal T1 domain and amino acids 740-853 of the C-terminal region (“CTA” domain) have been shown to be involved in determining the time course of activation of the channel (19Ju M. Stevens L. Leadbitter E. Wray D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12769-12778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and interactions between the T1 domain and the CTA domain have been demonstrated. We report here that relative voltage-gated rearrangements in the cytoplasmic domain of the Kv2.1 channel may be successfully probed by FRET between ECFP and EYFP fluorophores fused to the termini of the Kv2.1 monomers. Our data describe the relative movements between the termini of the Kv2.1 subunits and demonstrate that they occur in a plane parallel to the plasma membrane.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Biology—ECFPN-Kv2.1 and EYFPN-Kv2.1 were constructed by inserting the tag before amino acid 2 of rat Kv2.1. For this, the standard PCR overlap extension method was used (20Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR products were made from rKv2.1-pcDNA3 and either pEYFP or pECFP (Clontech) as a template, using appropriate primers and Pfu polymerase (25 cycles, 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min/kb at 72 °C, plus one cycle, 10 min at 72 °C). Second-round PCR was carried out using these fragments with the same PCR protocol and appropriate primers. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and ClaI and ligated into the similarly digested vector (pcDNA3 or pGEMHE for expression in COS cells or oocytes, respectively). The C-terminal ECFP and EYFP tags were inserted after amino acid 853 (removing the stop codon in rKv2.1). For this, the PCR overlap extension method was used as above, and the product was digested with AflII and XbaI and ligated into the similarly digested vectors. For the constructs with both the N and C termini labeled with the fluorescent tags, we started by digesting the N-terminal-tagged constructs using EcoRI and ClaI and ligated these into the similarly digested C-terminal-tagged constructs with T4 ligase. All chimeras were confirmed by automated dideoxy sequencing. EYFPN-PH was described earlier (15Kobrinsky E. Schwartz E. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5021-5028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The ECFP-EYFP concatamer with 21-amino acid linker was kindly provided by David T. Yue (Johns Hopkins University).Cell Culture and Transfection—COS1 cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips (MatTek) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with cDNA coding for the wild type and labeled Kv2.1 using the Effectene kit (Qiagen) as described previously (15Kobrinsky E. Schwartz E. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5021-5028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For FRET experiments, all mixed constructs were expressed at 1:1 molar ratio (unless otherwise specified) under conditions optimized by the kit manufacturer for a total amount of 0.2 μg of DNA/35-mm Petri dish. Relative expression levels for the constructs were approximately the same as judged from the K+ current amplitudes. For acceptor photobleaching experiments, COS1 cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde 24 h after transfection.Electrophysiology—All recordings for simultaneous patch clamp and FRET measurements were made from COS1 cells. Currents were recorded in whole-cell patch clamp configuration 24-48 h after transfection using patch clamp amplifier Axopatch 200B (Axon). Currents were activated from a Vh of -80 mV, sampled at 5 kHz, filtered at 2 kHz, and leak subtracted using the P/N procedure. The solutions were similar to those optimized by Murakoshi et al. (18Murakoshi H. Shi G. Scannevin R.H. Trimmer J.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The bath solution contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 10 Na-HEPES, pH 7.2. The pipette solution contained (in mm) 140 KCl, 1 CaCl2,10 Na-EGTA, 10 Na-HEPES, pH 7.2. Time constants of activation were determined by single exponential fitting in Clampfit 9.2.Imaging—Images were recorded with a Hamamatsu digital camera C9100-12 mounted on the Nikon epifluorescent microscope TE200 (60 × 1.2 n.a. objective) equipped with multiple filter sets (Chroma Technology). Excitation light was delivered by a 75-watt Xenon lamp. C-Imaging (Compix) and Meta-Morph (Universal Imaging) software were used to obtain and analyze images. FRET was quantified with three filter sets: for EYFP cube, excitation filter 500/20 nm, dichroic beam splitter 515 nm, emission filter 535/30 nm; for FRET (ECFP/EYFP) cube, excitation 436/20 nm, dichroic beam splitter 455 nm, emission filter 540/30 nm; for ECFP cube, excitation filer 436/20 nm, dichroic beam splitter 455 nm, emission filter 480/40 nm. Acceptor EYFP photobleaching was performed as described previously (14Kobrinsky E. Kepplinger K.J.F. Yu A. Harry J.B. Kahr H. Romanin C. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. Biophys.

A YFP photobleaching cube (Chroma) was composed of a D535/50x excitation filter and a 100% mirror (instead of a dichroic one). FRET efficiency was calculated as (IECFP* - IECFP)/IECFP*, where IECFP and IECFP* are the intensities of ECFP fluorescence before and after acceptor EYFP photobleaching. Regions of interest were selected using the C-Imaging software where intensity (I) from three filter sets was determined after background subtraction. Corrected (IFRETc) and normalized (NFRET) intensity of FRET was calculated with all pixels of regions of interest as described previously (14Kobrinsky E. Kepplinger K.J.F. Yu A. Harry J.B. Kahr H.

FRET cell images are provided for illustration purposes only.Quantative colocalization of ECFP- and EYFP-labeled Kv2.1 was measured with C-Imaging software by calculating overlap of the signals representing the true degree of colocalization. Overlap is not sensitive to the limitations of typical fluorescence imaging, such as efficiency of hybridization, sample photobleaching, or camera quantum efficiency. Overlap was measured as shown in Equation 1 according to: ΣnI1n·I2nΣnI1n2·ΣnI2n2(Eq. 1) where I1 = the intensity in channel 1, I2 = the intensity in channel 2.RESULTSElectrophysiological Properties of the Kv2.1 Channel Are Not Compromised by Genetic Fusion of ECFP and EYFP—To explore voltage-gated movements between the termini of the Kv2.1 channel, we fused ECFP (or EYFP) to the C-terminal tail (Kv2.1-ECFPC and Kv2.1-EYFPC, respectively) and EYFP to the N-terminal tail (EYFPN-Kv2.1) of the Kv2.1 monomer. In addition, the double-labeled channel EYFPN-Kv2.1-ECFPC was generated to primarily investigate movements within the individual monomers. Because Kv2.1 is constitutively phosphorylated when expressed in COS1 cells (21Shi G. Kleinklaus A.K. Marrion N.V. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23204-23211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we used this expression system to exclude ambiguity associated with regulation of Kv2.1 by phosphorylation. Another important advantage was that no endogenous Kv2.1 channel activity was observed in COS1 cells under patch clamp conditions as explored by Trimmer and coworkers (21Shi G. Kleinklaus A.K. Marrion N.V. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23204-23211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize electrophysiological properties of the labeled channels, we recorded K+ currents from COS1 cells of approximately similar size transfected by Kv2.1-ECFPC, Kv2.1-EYFPC, EYFPN-Kv2.1, and EYFPN-Kv2.1-ECFPC. Representative traces of the K+ current evoked by step depolarizations from a Vh of -80 mV and the corresponding currentvoltage (I-V) relationships are shown in Fig. 1. All four fluorescent channels showed slowly activating outward K+ currents that exhibited little or no inactivation during 200-ms depolarizations typical for the wild-type Kv2.1 (Fig. 1A). The time constant of activation with step to +60 mV was 5.8 ± 0.8 ms (n = 8), 6.7 ± 3.0 ms (n = 3), 4.0 ± 0.7 ms (n = 8), and 5.4 ± 1.4 ms (n = 6) for the Kv2.1-EYFPC, Kv2.1-ECFPC, EYFPN-Kv2.1, and EYFPN-Kv2.1-ECFPC channels, respectively. Kinetics of activation of all four fluorescent derivatives was not markedly different from those measured with the wild-type Kv2.1 (6.5 ± 0.8 ms, n = 4). For both COS1 cells (Fig. 1B) and oocytes (supplemental Fig. S1C), normalized I-V curves were not markedly different from controls. Thus, electrophysiological properties of the single- and double-labeled Kv2.1 channels were not markedly changed by the fusion of the fluorescent proteins.Homogeneity of Distribution of the Expressed Labeled Kv2.1 Subunits—FRET experiments require the presence of the reporter ECFP and EYFP fluorophores on the same or different subunits of the channel complex. The latter situation may be complicated by non-homogenous distribution of labeled subunits. Thus we first examined the homogeneity of expression of the labeled subunits in Kv2.1 tetramers by measuring colocalization of the ECFP and EYFP fluorescence along the cell plasma membrane (Fig. 2). Colocalization is defined here as a spatial overlap of ECFP and EYFP in the same pixel in the image. In each case, comparison was made with the following controls representing a priori true colocalization of the fluorophores: the cytoplasmic ECFP-EYFP fusion protein without Kv2.1 (Fig. 2A, overlap 0.999 ± 0.001, n = 6) or the plasma membrane-bound EYFPN-Kv2.1-ECFPC (Fig. 2B, overlap 0.993 ± 0.002, n = 9). Thus >99% of the pixel signals from ECFP and EYFP in the controls were overlapping. Spatial overlap in 1:1 (mol/mol) mixtures of ECFPN-Kv2.1 and EYFPN-Kv2.1 (0.993 ± 0.001, n = 13, Fig. 2C) as well as Kv2.1-ECFPC and Kv2.1-EYFPC (0.0968 ± 0.006, n = 12, Fig. 2D) was not significantly different from controls. For the EYFPN-Kv2.1/Kv2.1-ECFPC (1:1) mixture (Fig. 2E), overlap was 0.936 ± 0.025 (n = 9). Although this was significantly different from controls (p < 0.05, unpaired t test), >93% of pixels showed overlap, thus confirming a predominantly even distribution of the EYFPN-Kv2.1 and Kv2.1-ECFPC subunits in the channel tetramers in the plasma membrane region. The fact that there is no preferential assembly of EYFPN-Kv2.1 or Kv2.1-ECFPC is crucial for the interpretation of FRET data, as will be shown below.FIGURE 2Colocalization of the ECFP and EYFP fluorescence along the cell plasma membrane confirming homogeneity of expression of the labeled subunits in Kv2.1 tetramers. Shown are fluorescence images of representative COS1 cells expressing ECFP-EYFP (A), EYFPN-Kv2.1-ECFPC (B), and 1:1 (mol/mol) mixtures of EYFPN-Kv2.1 + ECFPN-Kv2.1 (C), Kv2.1-ECFPC + Kv 2.1-EYFPC (D), and EYFPN-Kv2.1 + Kv2.1-ECFPC (E) obtained with CFP (a) and YFP (b) filters, and the corresponding intensity scattergrams (c).

Schwartz E. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5021-5028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The tetrameric Kv2.1 channel has four C termini and four N termini. To comprehensively characterize voltage-gated movements in the cytoplasmic compartment of the channel, we measured voltage-dependent changes of NFRET between the N and C termini of the individual subunit and between the tails of the neighboring subunits, as well as with respect to the plasma membrane-trapped probes.Initial FRET measurements were carried out in COS1 cells expressing EYFPN-Kv2.1-ECFPC after they were fixed by formaldehyde to immobilize protein in native (but unspecified) conformation. Under these conditions, not affected by the photobleaching-induced free radicals, FRET efficiency was 0.09 ± 0.03 (n = 4), i.e. ∼25% of the maximum value found for the ECFP-EYFP fusion protein under similar conditions. Thus N- and C-terminal fluorophores of the channel are in sufficient proximity to measure their mutual rearrangements in response to depolarization. To explore voltage-gated movements in a double-tagged subunit of the Kv2.1 channel, we expressed EYFPN-Kv2.1-ECFPC in COS1 cells and recorded NFRET between the fluorophores under voltage clamp conditions (Fig. 3). Comparison with the subcellular distribution of YFPN-PH, used in this work as a plasma membrane marker (see below), showed that FRET was confined to the plasma membrane region, which is the site of localization of functional Kv2.1 channels. FRET recordings in this region (Fig. 3B) were made simultaneously with current recordings at the holding potential (-80 mV) and after depolarization to +60 mV as indicated in Fig. 3C. Fig. 3D shows the FRET image recorded at -80 mV (with channels closed), and Fig. 3E shows the FRET image recorded at the end of the +60-mV depolarization pulse applied to activate the channels. As can be seen, at both voltages a substantial NFRET was recorded between the N- and C-terminal fluorophores of the EYFPN-Kv2.1-ECFPC subunits. The ratio (Fig. 3F) of these images shows a significant (p < 0.05) decrease of NFRET during depolarization that on average was NFRET(+60)/NFRET(-80) = 0.935 ± 0.03 (n = 10). The acceptor photobleaching assay independently confirmed this observation: FRET efficiency measured in live cells decreased 4.4-fold, from 0.11 ± 0.05 at -80 mV to 0.025 ± 0.01 at +60 mV (n = 6). In parallel with these controls, we also tested whether the voltage-dependent decrease of NFRET is stable during the continuing depolarization. The ratio of NFRET(+60)/NFRET(-80) was measured in six separate consecutive 300-ms episodes at +60 mV (Fig. 3G). In all these experiments (n = 10), the significant (p < 0.05) decrease of NFRET lasted for the duration of depolarization and was completely reversible on returning to -80 mV. Thus, voltage-dependent intramolecular rearrangements between N and C termini of Kv2.1 occur in a linear nanometer scale that corresponds to estimated (13Long S.B. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar) voltage-gated movements of the central core S6 helices directly connected to the C-tails.FIGURE 3Characterization of voltage-gated movements between the N- and C-tails in the EYFPN-Kv2.1-ECFPC channel.

B, phase-contrast cell image with a shadow of patch pipette. Scale bar, 6 μm. C, trace of the K+ current evoked by a test pulse to +60 mV from Vh =-80 mV recorded from a representative COS1 cell selected for FRET microscopy. Representative corrected images of FRET between ECFP and EYFP were recorded in the plasma membrane region marked by the yellow box in panel B, at Vh = -80 mV (D) and after the depolarization pulse to +60 mV was applied (E). The respective time windows for FRET acquisition are marked below the current trace in panel C by green (-80 mV) and red (+60 mV) bars. F, the ratio of images D/E showing the voltage-dependent change of corrected FRET. G, time dependence of NFRET (normalized to the initial value at -80 mV; n = 10) in the EYFPN-Kv2.1-ECFPC channel consecutively recorded with 300-ms intervals during continuous depolarization to +60 mV (gray bars). The first and the last measurements (white bars) were at Vh = -80 mV. The voltage protocol is shown on the upper panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Change of FRET recorded at -80 and +60 mV (Fig. 3, F and G) may reflect movements that occur between EYFP and ECFP within both individual and neighboring subunits. To test for the latter possibility, EYFPN-Kv2.1-ECFPC was co-expressed with unlabeled Kv2.1 in ratios increasing from 1:1 to as high as 1:15. Under these conditions, intermolecular FRET would decrease or be eliminated completely due to “dilution” with the unlabeled Kv2.1, which should effectively reduce the number of labeled Kv2.1 subunits to much less than one per channel on average. However, NFRET did not change significantly as compared with the “undiluted” channel and retained voltage dependence. Decrease of NFRET during depolarization on average was NFRET(+60)/NFRET(-80) = 0.91 ± 0.04 (n = 5), suggesting that voltage-dependent changes in FRET are not altered by the dilution with unlabeled channel. Thus, contribution of the intermolecular FRET between the fluorophores of EYFPN-Kv2.1-ECFPC to the overall FRET signal was negligible, and the differential corrected FRET image shown in Fig. 3F therefore reflects voltage-gated movements within an individual Kv2.1 subunit. Although the double-tagged experiments can unambiguously show FRET within subunit, further experiments were carried out to characterize FRET between subunits.Voltage-gated Movements between the Termini of Different Kv2.1 Subunits—The EYFP/ECFP single-labeled Kv2.1 subunits assembled in 1:1 molar ratio may show several possible donor-acceptor arrangements in the tetrameric channel. If donor or acceptor is fused to the same terminus of a monomer, there are two different arrangements, one with equidistant fluorophores on adjacent subunits compared with diagonally opposing ones. In the case of the channel composed of the EYFPN-Kv2.1 and Kv2.1-ECFPC subunits, arrangement of fluorophores on contiguous subunits is not equidistant, and there are three different possible donor-acceptor relationships. Without irreversible fixation and photobleaching, which are incompatible with voltage-gated FRET microscopy, estimation of individual contribution of these arrangements into the overall voltage-dependent change of FRET was not possible by virtue of patch clamp measurements in live cells. However, FRET measurements in other Kv channels showed that the FRET contribution of the diagonal arrangement is minimal (22Cha A. Snyder G.E. Selvin P.R. Bezanilla F. Nature. 1999; 402: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 23Riven I. Kalmanzon E. Segev L. Eitan R. Neuron. 2003; 38: 225-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Another potential source of uncertainty is FRET between the tetramers. In fixed cells FRET was consistently observed only between the Kv2.1 subunits assembled in tetramers and not between the tetramers (16Kerschensteiner D. Soto F. Stocker M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6160-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our FRET dilution experiments with EYFPN-Kv2.1-ECFPC confirmed this conclusion by demonstrating that FRET between the subunits, including different tetramers, was negligible compared with the intrasubunit FRET. In all tested 1:1 mixtures of single-labeled Kv2.1 subunits dilution with unlabeled Kv2.1 diminished FRET. Because fluorescence was evenly distributed in transfected COS1 cells similar to EYFPN-Kv2.1-ECFPC (Fig. 2), FRET between the channels is also insignificant in all tested combinations of the single-labeled subunits expressed in 1:1 molar ratio.Having addressed these ambiguities, here we have studied FRET between single-tagged constructs in order to characterize voltage-gated movements between the N and C termini of different Kv2.1 subunits of the tetrameric channel. For this, we coexpressed EYFPN-Kv2.1 and Kv2.1-ECFPC in 1:1 molar ratio in COS1 cells.FRET measurements in formaldehyde-fixed COS1 cells expressing the EYFPN-Kv2.1 + Kv2.1-ECFPC (1:1) channel showed FRET efficiency of 0.085 ± 0.025 (n = 8). To examine voltage-gated movements between the N and C termini of different Kv2.1 subunits, we used both ratiometric FRET microscopy and photobleaching techniques under voltage clamp conditio"

Since osteoclast differentiation includes a dramatic increase in cell volume, we hypothesize that aquaporin(s) is/are critical for the formation of the multinucleated osteoclast from its mononuclear precursor. Our studies employ two cell models, bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) and the murine macrophage-like cell line, RAW264.7, as osteoclast precursors. Receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL) and macrophage-colony-stimulating factor or RANKL alone were used to induce osteoclast differentiation in BMMs or RAW264.7 cells, respectively. We first used qualitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to examine which of the aquaporins are expressed in osteoclasts and in their precursor cells. Out of the 10 aquaporins examined, only aquaporin 9 (AQP9) was expressed in osteoclast-lineage cells. AQP9 has unique aqueous pore properties mediating the passage of a wide variety of non-charged solutes in addition to water. Western analyses using specific antibodies revealed a higher AQP9 level in RANKL-treated than in untreated cells. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses also demonstrated higher AQP9 mRNA levels in RANKL-treated cells. Finally, we examined the effect of phloretin, an AQP9 inhibitor, on RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation. Cells were incubated with RANKL for 5 days, and phloretin was added for the last 2 days, when most fusion occurs. A dramatic reduction in osteoclast size and in the number of nuclei per osteoclast was observed in cultures containing phloretin. The inhibitor did not have a significant effect on the number and size of mononuclear phagocytes in cultures not treated with RANKL.

The osteoclast is the principal, if not exclusive, resorptive bone cell and plays a central role in the formation, growth, and remodeling of the skeleton. This multinucleated cell is formed by the fusion of mononuclear progenitors of the monocyte/macrophage family (1Suda T. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Jimi E. Gillespie M.T. Martin T.J. Endocr.

Excessive osteoclastic activity leads to progressive loss of bone mass causing weakening of the skeleton, manifested by a variety of pathological conditions including osteoporosis. Reduced osteoclast activity results in the formation of overly dense bones, as found in osteopetrosis. Thus, regulation of osteoclastogenesis plays an important role in maintaining a healthy skeleton (1Suda T. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Jimi E. Gillespie M.T. Martin T.J. Endocr.

The volume of a sphere formed by fusion of several spheres (keeping the total surface the sum of the original surfaces) is greater than the total volume of the original spheres. Although the osteoclast and its precursors are not perfect spheres we hypothesize that at least qualitatively this phenomenon should occur when multinucleated osteoclasts are formed by the fusion of their precursors. Therefore, during osteoclastogenesis active synthesis of cytosol should take place. Since water is the main component of the cytosol, massive water influx is expected during osteoclastogenesis. The discovery of aquaporins (water channels) in 1992 by Agre and colleagues (6Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 687-698Crossref Scopus (1690) Google Scholar) dramatically changed the concept of regulation of water transport through biological membranes. Aquaporins are ∼30-kDa tetrameric proteins (7King L.S. Kozono D. Agre P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 800-806Crossref Scopus (769) Google Scholar) characterized by six transmembrane-spanning helices, and both termini are cytosolic. Aquaporins are expressed across all organisms and control water transport in all cells (8Maurel C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Eleven mammalian aquaporins have been identified so far and they have cellular and subcellular distributions in different organs that indicate probable functional roles.

Our assumption that a massive water influx is required for the formation of the multinucleated osteoclast leads to our working hypothesis that aquaporin(s) is/are critical for this process. To this end, we examined the expression of aquaporins in osteoclasts and in their precursors. We identified aquaporin 9 (AQP9) as the only aquaporin that is expressed in osteoclast-lineage cells and whose level is markedly increased with differentiation. Moreover, phloretin, an AQP9 inhibitor, reduced osteoclast differentiation and decreased their size and nuclei number dramatically. Cells—Primary bone marrow cells (BMMs) from long bones of 7-9-week-old BALB/c male mice and murine macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells were prepared as detailed previously (11Amcheslavsky A. Bar-Shavit Z. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 207: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in an incubator with with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. To assess osteoclast differentiation BMMs (7 × 103/well in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% FCS and supernatant from CMG14-12 (1:20) as a source for macrophage-colony-stimulating factor) were incubated in 96-well plates (0.2 ml/well). Bacterially produced recombinant RANKL was added to induce osteoclast differentiation. Medium was changed on day 3 and osteoclast formation was evaluated on day 5 (see below). Tartrate-resistant Acid Phosphatase (TRAP)—A commercial kit (catalog number 387-A, Sigma) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. TRAP-positive cells containing three or more nuclei were scored as osteoclasts. RNA Extraction and cDNA Preparation—BMMs (2.5 × 105/plate) and RAW264.7 cells (3 × 105/plate) were plated in 35-mm tissue culture plates as described previously (11Amcheslavsky A. Bar-Shavit Z. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 207: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated using an EZ-RNA kit (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA from mouse kidney was received from Drs.

The RNA was treated with DNase (RQ1-RNase-free DNase, Promega, Madison, WI) and tested for being an essentially DNA-free by a PCR reaction as a negative control. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using the Superscript II pre-amplification system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1091-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and L32 genes were all Assays-on-Demand products from Applied Biosystems, and reactions were set up according to the manufacturer's directions. Real-time PCR was performed in triplicate in 25-μl reactions on the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System. The relative level of each mRNA was determined using the comparative CT method for relative quantification with L32 as an endogenous reference (13Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—BMMs were seeded (7.5 × 105/35-mm tissue culture plate), and whole cell lysates were prepared in 200 μl of lysis buffer as described previously (11Amcheslavsky A. Bar-Shavit Z. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 207: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Antibodies (obtained from Alpha Diagnostic) were used at the following dilutions: chicken anti-AQP9 antibody (1:1000), mouse anti-β-actin antibody (1:10,000), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:10,000), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken antibody (1:10,000). Immunoreactivity was assayed using an ECL kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Surface Area Measurements—The surface area occupied by osteoclasts and their precursors was quantified using a computerized image analysis system (Olympus BX50, DP50, software: ImagePro Plus, Media Cybernetics). Methylene Blue Uptake—Cells were seeded as for the osteoclast differentiation assay (see above). Monolayers were fixed and methylene blue uptake was measured as described (14Goldman R. Bar-Shavit Z. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1979; 63: 1009-1016PubMed Google Scholar). Data Analysis—Experiments were repeated two to five times, and each experimental treatment was performed with six replications, unless stated otherwise. Data were analyzed with the JMP statistics package (version 4.1, from SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). To study the role of aquaporins in osteoclast differentiation, we first examined which aquaporins are expressed in osteoclast and/or in their precursor cells. RNA was isolated from BMMs and RAW264.7 cells grown with or without RANKL. Using semiquantitative RT-PCR (Table 2) we found that out of 10 aquaporin genes examined, only AQP9, an aquaglyceroporin, was expressed in osteoclasts and their precursors. RNA preparations obtained from kidney were used as positive controls for certain aquaporins, validating that only AQP9 is expressed in osteoclast-lineage cells.TABLE 2Expression of aquaporins in mouse cells and tissues RNA was prepared as described and semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed using the primers described in Table I. GAPDH and actin were used as the reference housekeeping genes. - and + denote the absence and presence, respectively, of the specific mRNA. For the RAW264.7 cells and BMMs the results represent both mononuclear and multinucleated (RANKL-treated) cells.RAW264.7BMMsKidneyAQP1––+AQP2––+AQP3––+AQP4––+AQP5–––AQP6––+AQP7––+AQP8––+AQP9+++AQP0––– Open table in a new tab Quantitative real-time PCR was used to examine whether AQP9 expression is modulated during osteoclast differentiation. In Fig. 1A we show that the expression of AQP9 is markedly increased (about 10-fold) in osteoclasts (RANKL-treated BMMs) as compared with their precursors (BMMs that were not exposed to RANKL). While microscopic examination confirmed the osteoclastic phenotype of the RANKL-treated cells, we also measured levels of the established osteoclast marker, MMP9, to verify osteoclastic differentiation. Detailed kinetic analyses showed that the expression of both AQP9 and MMP9 was increased by RANKL already after 24 h of exposure to RANKL (∼3- and 80-fold, respectively). It is of note that these changes were observed 2 days prior to any detectable fusion of the precursors. Maximal induction of AQP9 expression was 7-fold (6-12-fold in different experiments), while MMP9 maximal induction was ∼4700-fold (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis showed that AQP9 protein is expressed in osteoclast-lineage cells, and similar to the differential mRNA expression, we also found, using specific anti-AQP9-antibodies, that osteoclasts (RANKL-treated BMMs) express higher levels of AQP9 protein than the precursor cells (Fig. 2). Two bands (apparent molecular masses of 32 and 35 kDa) were observed, similar to previous observations using bile and liver preparations (15Okada S. Misaka T. Matsumoto I. Watanabe H. Abe K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 540: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 16Talbot N.C. Garrett W.M. Caperna T.J. Cells Tissues Organs. 2003; 174: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, AQP9 expression is increased during osteoclast differentiation. To examine whether AQP9 plays a role in this process, we studied the effect of phloretin, a specific AQP9 activity inhibitor (17Tsukaguchi H. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Mackenzie B. Devidas S. Guggino W.B. van Hoek A.N. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24737-24743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), on RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation. In preliminary analyses we found that the presence of phloretin throughout the full 5 days of the experiment resulted in cell death. Therefore, cells were incubated with or without RANKL for 5 days, and phloretin (or Me2SO, the solvent of phloretin stock solution for control cells) was added to the medium for the last 2 days, when most fusion occurs. As seen in Fig. 3, RANKL induced TRAP-positive multinucleated cells also in the presence of phloretin (Fig. 3D). However, the size of the cells was markedly reduced in the phloretin-treated cells (compare B and D of Fig. 3). We also see in the figure that phloretin had no effect on the morphology of cells not treated with RANKL (compare A and C of Fig. 3). Thus, under these conditions phloretin does not exert toxic effects. To quantify the effect of phloretin on cell size, we used Imagepro software to measure the surface area occupied by the cells. We find in Table 3 that phloretin did not significantly affect the area occupied by mononuclear cells. In contrast, RANKL-induced cells treated with phloretin occupied ∼10-fold less area than the control RANKL-induced Me2SO-treated cells. The number of nuclei/osteoclast was assessed in triplicate cultures, counting 100 osteoclasts in each well. The number of nuclei/osteoclast decreased from 18.5 ± 1.9 in the absence of phloretin to 6.1 ± 0.6 in the presence of the inhibitor. The number of osteoclasts/well did not differ significantly between control and phloretin-treated cultures. Thus, 3-fold less mononuclear cells were induced to undergo osteoclast differentiation in cultures containing phloretin. Of special interest is the comparison of area occupied by cells derived from phloretin-treated and untreated cultures with the same number of nuclei. Quantification of this phenomenon showed that phloretin-treated osteoclasts containing 18.0 ± 1.1 nuclei occupied 15% of the area occupied by untreated osteoclasts, which contained 19.2 ± 1.1 nuclei.TABLE 3Modulation by phloretin of surface area occupied by cells BMMs were treated with or without RANKL, and phloretin (50 μm) was added as detailed. Numbers represent the surface area/cell (μm2) ± S.E. of the 50 largest cells under each experimental condition.Phloretin–RANKL+RANKL–255 ± 5236,323 ± 6170+267 ± 623,722 ± 4351 Open table in a new tab The effect of phloretin on methylene blue uptake is shown in Fig. 4. No effect was observed on mononuclear precursors (BMMs grown in the absence of RANKL). Methylene blue stains both nuclei and cytoplasm and is a reliable measurement of relative cell numbers when there is no difference in cell size and morphology between the examined populations (14Goldman R. Bar-Shavit Z. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1979; 63: 1009-1016PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, phloretin does not inhibit mononuclear cell proliferation and size. In contrast, a marked inhibition of methylene blue uptake is observed in RANKL-treated cells, reflecting the decreased cell size. Although discovered only relatively recently, it is already clear that aquaporins are involved in several pathological situations. For example, hereditary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by mutations in AQP2 (18Lloyd D.J. Hall F.W. Tarantino L.M. Gekakis N. PLoS Genet. 2005; 1: 171-178Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and mutations in AQP0 cause congenital cataracts (10Agre P. King L.S. Yasui M. Guggino W.B. Ottersen O.P. Fujiyoshi Y. Engel A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 1: 3-16Crossref Scopus (926) Google Scholar). In addition, enhanced expression of AQP4 was observed in brains of patients with inflammatory diseases (19Aoki-Yoshino K. Uchihara T. Duyckaerts C. Nakamura A. Hauw J.J. Wakayama Y. Acta Neuropathol. 2005; 110: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and AQP1 was found to be expressed in normal human cornea and decreased in human corneas with endothelial disease but not in human corneas with non-endothelial corneal disease (20Macnamara E. Sams G.W. Smith K. Ambati J. Singh N. Ambati B.K. Mol. Vis. 2004; 26: 51-56Google Scholar). These are a few of a growing number of examples pointing to the important physiological roles played by aquaporins. We show here for the first time that a member of the aquaporin family, AQP9, plays a role in the differentiation of the bone-resorbing cell, the osteoclast. Previously, in two other examples, aquaporins were implicated in differentiation/development. The ontogeny and distribution of AQP7 and AQP8 in rat testis raised the possibility that these aquaporins are involved in testis development and spermatogenesis (21Calamita G. Mazzone A. Bizzoca A. Svelto M. Biocem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It was also suggested that aquaporin proteins (3Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 8Maurel C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 399-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, and 9Mobasheri A. Trujillo E. Bell S. Carter S.D. Clegg P.D. Martin-Vasallo P. Marples D. Vet. J. 2004; 168: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) mediate trans-trophectodermal water movements during cavitation (22Barcroft L.C. Offenberg H. Thomsen P. Watson A.J. Dev. Biol. 2003; 256: 342-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Differentiation of the osteoclast includes fusion of mononuclear precursors to form the multinucleated osteoclast. The surface area and the volume of a sphere are proportional to the radius squared and cubed, respectively. Therefore, upon fusion of the precursors, the volume of the mature osteoclast increases more dramatically than its surface area and therefore must “add” new cytosol. Water being the major cytosolic component strongly suggests the use of aquaporin(s) for the enhanced water influx. We indeed find increased expression of AQP9 following induction of osteoclastogenesis by RANKL. The fact that the increase in AQP9 expression precedes the fusion is consistent with the hypothesis that this channel plays a role in the formation of a large multinucleated osteoclast, probably by mediating rapid water influx to enable the increase in cell volume. Moreover, phloretin, an efficient inhibitor of AQP9 (17Tsukaguchi H. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Mackenzie B. Devidas S. Guggino W.B. van Hoek A.N. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24737-24743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 23Cheung K.H. Leung C.T. Leung G.P. Wong P.Y. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 1505-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), reduces the size of RANKL-induced osteoclasts, probably by inhibition of the rapid water influx. Of special interest is the observation that osteoclasts with the same number of nuclei are much smaller in phloretin-treated cultures, suggesting a role for AQP9-mediated water influx in determining the size of the cell. However, phloretin may affect additional channels, for example it inhibits volume-sensitive and cyclic AMP-activated Cl7 channels (24Fan H.T. Morishima S. Kida H. Okada Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 1096-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To inhibit AQP9 activity in a more specific manner we are currently investigating this point using SiRNA technology to specifically block the expression of the channel. AOP9 is a unique aquaglyceroporin that, in addition to its water and glycerol transport properties, is also permeable to urea, mannitol, sorbitol, and other small solutes (17Tsukaguchi H. Shayakul C.

Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Hediger M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: 685-696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AQP9 is found in lung, liver, brain, spleen, peripheral blood leukocytes, and testes (17Tsukaguchi H. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Mackenzie B. Devidas S. Guggino W.B. van Hoek A.N. Hediger M.A. J. Biol.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1118-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and we can now add osteoclasts to this list. The broad selectivity of AQP9 permits rapid and energetically efficient metabolite exchanges in cells. This characteristic is beneficial to osteoclasts that absorb and secrete large amounts of metabolites. Our studies demonstrate a novel physiological role for aquaporin, the involvement in cell fusion and differentiation. Moreover, AQP9 is a likely candidate target for developing a novel strategy to inhibit osteoclastogenesis and may thus be beneficial in the treatment of a variety of diseases caused by enhanced osteoclastic bone resorption, such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis.

Specificity of inhibitors for the targeted kinase(s), however, is a crucial factor for therapeutic success. Based on homology modeling, we previously identified four amino acids in the active site of Rho-kinase that likely determine inhibitor specificities observed for Rho-kinase relative to protein kinase A (PKA) (in PKA numbering: T183A, L49I, V123M, and E127D), and a fifth (Q181K) that played a surprising role in PKA-PKB hybrid proteins.

Phosphorylation via protein kinases is responsible for a large part of cellular signal transduction and is described as a universal regulatory mechanism (1Krebs E.G. JAMA. 1989; 262: 1815-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 2Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar). Perturbation of kinase-mediated signaling pathways results in a number of diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and inflammation (3Bishop J.M. Science. 1987; 235: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar, 4Pawson T. Hunter T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because most protein kinases reside in the cell in an inactive state and are activated by signal transduction processes, many diseases are triggered by overactivation of protein kinases via mutation, overexpression, or malfunctioning cellular inhibition. The human genome encodes some 518 protein kinases (5Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6315) Google Scholar) that are notably different in how their catalysis is regulated but share a catalytic domain conserved in sequence and structure (6Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar, 7Krebs E.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1985; 13: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The latter consists of 250-300 amino acids, binds substrate and cosubstrate, and catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction. This catalytic domain, together with less conserved surrounding sites, has been the focus of inhibitor design that has exploited differences in kinase structure and pliability to achieve selectivity. Many drugs that target protein kinases are in clinical trials, and some have already been approved, such as the Abl kinase inhibitor Gleevec for therapy against chronic myelogenous leukemia (8Corbin A.S. Toledo L.M. Lydon N.B. Buchdunger E. Kuriyan J. Druker B.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 2025Google Scholar) and Tarceva (erlotinib) against nonsmall cell lung cancer (9Brown E.R. Shepherd F.A. Expert Rev. Anticancer Ther. 2005; 5: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The first protein kinase inhibitor that passed the clinical phase was fasudil (HA1077) in 1995 as a treatment for cerebral vasospasm (10Ono-Saito N. Niki I. Hidaka H. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It has a significant vasodilatory effect attributed to its inhibition of Rho-kinase (11Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K.

Apart from its pharmacological role in cerebral vasospasm and angina pectoris, Rho-kinase plays an important role in cell division, differentiation, apoptosis, transformation, and the invasion and migration of cancer cells (12Amano M. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) (for reviews see Riento and Ridley (14Riento K. Ridley A.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Med. 2002; 80: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar)). Selectivity considerations can be critical for inhibitor design, and it is thus of utmost importance to understand the factors that govern the specific binding of kinase inhibitors to the catalytic center of protein kinases (17Cohen M.S.

Accordingly, to address this question with regard to Rho-kinase we recently determined the structure of PKA 5The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit; PKAR, mutant PKA with PKA to Rho-kinase amino acid exchanges; HA1077, fasudil; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; PKB, protein kinase B; AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; PKI(5-24), protein kinase inhibitor residues 5-24. in complex with the inhibitors fasudil, H1152P, and Y-27632, demonstrating characteristic binding within the ATP site (22Breitenlechner C. Gassel M. Hidaka H. Kinzel V. Huber R. Engh R.A. Bossemeyer D. Structure. 2003; 11: 1595-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Homology modeling comparisons with Rho-kinase indicated the likely stereochemical basis for the selectivity of the inhibitors and their relatively high affinity for Rho-kinase. From sequence alignment of 491 kinases, and additionally considering an AGC-kinase-specific residue from the non-conserved C-tail, Rho-kinase has a unique combination of residues at the ATP binding site, although individual residues show a considerable degree of conservation in the family. We suggested that the combination of four residues at the ligand-binding site, which generate a uniquely shaped inhibitor binding pocket, confers selectivity of Rho-kinase over closely related kinases like PKA. Hence we used site-directed mutagenesis to exchange these amino acids in PKA for their counterparts of Rho-kinase, individually and in combination, and evaluated the kinetic binding data of selected inhibitors with the PKA mutants. The data confirm the stepwise introduction of Rho-like inhibitor binding specificity to the PKA mutants. Two exchanges, L49I and T183A, are responsible for most of the selectivity for the inhibitors tested. Crystal structures of the PKA-Rho-kinase surrogate hybrid show the details of the selectivity mechanisms. These results are consistent with results from other kinases that demonstrate importance of a few side chains for protein kinase inhibitor selectivity, for example for RSK by Cohen et al. (17Cohen M.S. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Taunton J. Science. 2005; 308: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Use of this PKA-based surrogate Rho-kinase should enable structure based design of therapeutics to treat Rho-kinase mediated diseases.

After inhibitor and enzyme were added to the assay mixture (100 mm Mops, pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.1 mm Kemptide, 1mm β-mercaptoethanol, 15 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma), 8 units/ml pyruvate kinase (Sigma), 0.21 mm NADH) the reaction was started with ATP. The decrease of NADH was measured as being time-dependent at λ = 340 nm with three independent measurements per data point. Km values, IC50 values, and standard deviations were calculated using SigmaPlot 8.0 and Origin50 software. Crystallization—The inhibitors Y-27632, KT5720, hydroxyfasudil, and staurosporine were purchased from Merck-Biosciences; the inhibitors HA1077 and H1152P were kindly provided by Hiroyoshi Hidaka. Inhibitors were co-crystallized with recombinant mutated bovine Cα catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the presence of PKI(5-24) using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Droplets contained 18 mg/ml protein, 30 mm Mes-BisTris, 75 mm LiCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PKI(5-24), pH 6.3-6.9, 3 mm MgCl2, and, except for PKAWT, 1mm inhibitor, and were equilibrated at 5 °C against 12-18% (v/v) methanol. Data Collection and Structure Determination—Diffraction data were measured from frozen crystals at the beamline BW6, Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, at Angström Quelle Karlsruhe (ANKA) beamline PX (ANKA, Karlsruhe, Germany), or in-house on a Rigaku R300 rotating anode. The data were processed with the programs XDS and XSCALE or MOSFLM and SCALA. The crystals have orthorhombic symmetry (P212121) (Table 1). The structures were determined by molecular replacement using AMoRe from the CCP4 program suite (www.ccp4.ac.uk/main/html). As search model we chose a PKA-PKI(5-24) 6S. Bonn, S. Herrero, C. B.

Calculations of Matthews's coefficients and solvent contents suggested one molecule in the asymmetric units. Phosphorylation sites were found at Thr-197 and Ser-338. Phosphorylated Ser-10 is resolved in PKAR5-1152, PKAR5-1077, and PKAR5. Water molecules were automatically inserted using the CCP4 programs PEAKMAX and WATPEAK and visually inspected. Finally, the inhibitor molecules were built and the whole complex was further refined. PKAR3-1152 showed a higher Rfree to Rcryst difference than the other structures, probably due to lower resolution and data quality from data collection on an in-house rotating anode x-ray generator. Ref-mac 5.1.24 was used for refinement, and MOLOC (www.moloc.ch) was used for model building and graphical modeling.

Schomburg D. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the resulting root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) values were graphically displayed. For a visual inspection of conformational changes, structures were aligned between the C-lobe residues 120-281, because this region comprising the conserved C-terminal lobe is conformationally most stable, using the program Pymol (www.pymol.org). Homology modeling shows the ATP-binding sites of PKA and Rho-kinase to differ most prominently at four residues (Fig. 1A) that contribute side-chain atoms to the ATP-site binding surface (22Breitenlechner C. Gassel M. Hidaka H. Kinzel V. Huber R. Engh R.A. Bossemeyer D. Structure. 2003; 11: 1595-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These are Leu-49 (isoleucine in Rho-kinase), Val-123 (M), Glu-127 (D), and Thr-183 (A). Rho-kinase and PKA share AGC kinase characteristic residues, in particular Phe-327 that lies in the ATP pocket adjacent to the adenine ring. The combination of these five residues is unique to Rho-kinase in the human kinome. The structural similarity of AGC kinases with known structures suggests that appropriate mutants of PKA will likely mimic Rho-kinase inhibitor selectivity. This is analogous to our design of PKA mutant mimics of PKB selectivity (28Gassel M. Breitenlechner C.B. Ruger P. Jucknischke U. Schneider T. Huber R. Bossemeyer D. Engh R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 1021-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this work, we observed that a residue not directly involved in ATP site contacts (Gln-181) can adopt a new conformation and obstruct the ATP site after mutation of Val-123 to the smaller alanine of PKB; an additional PKA to PKB mutation (Q181K) was required to eliminate this effect. Rho-kinase, like PKB, possesses a lysine at the position equivalent to Gln-181, although the PKA to Rho-kinase mutation of V123M does not create a cavity, as does the PKA to PKB mutation of V123A, and T183A does expand the ATP site cavity. Therefore, the exchange Q181K was included in the present mutagenesis analysis as a control. PKA-Cα and PKA mutants with single exchanges or with combinations of exchanges were expressed in E. coli, purified, and analyzed in an enzyme-coupled kinetic kinase assay (26Cook P.F. Neville Jr., M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski Jr., R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). GST-Rho-kinase was purified after expression in insect cells and subsequently kinetically characterized. Four single point mutants were produced: PKAR(T183A), PKAR(L49I), PKAR(V123M), and PKAR(E127D). Double mutants were made with PKAR(T183A) as a template: PKAR(Q181K/T183A), PKAR(L49I/T183A), and PKAR(V123M/T183A). Triple mutants were made with PKAR(Q181K/T183A) as template: PKAR(L49I/Q181K/T183A) and PKAR(V123M/ Q181K/T183A). Finally, quadruple and quintuple mutants were made: PKAR(V123M/L49I/Q181K/T183A) and PKAR(L49I/V123M/E127D/Q181K/T183A). Rho-kinase and PKA-specific Inhibitors—The inhibitors used in this study (Fig. 1B) originate from three different chemical classes. The Rho-kinase-specific inhibitors fasudil, hydroxyfasudil, and H1152P are isoquinoline sulfonamide derivatives. Relative to fasudil, hydroxyfasudil has an additional hydroxyl group in the position 1 of the isoquinoline ring (29Ito K. Shimomura E. Iwanaga T. Shiraishi M. Shindo K. Nakamura J. Nagumo H. Seto M. Sasaki Y. Takuwa Y. J. Physiol. Lond. 2003; 546: 823-836Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and H1152P has two additional methyl groups, one at the isoquinoline ring, and the other at the homopiperazine ring that confer higher selectivity and specificity for Rho-kinase. The PKA-specific inhibitor KT5720 is identical to staurosporine in the extended planar portion of the inhibitor but differs especially in its possession of a fatty acid side chain, extending from a furanose instead of a pyranose ring. Y-27632 is from a third chemical class, as a pyridine ring linked via an amide to a para-aminoethylcyclohexane ring. For the majority of the eleven mutant PKA-Cα kinases (PKARs), as well as for PKA-Cα and GST-Rho-kinase-CAT, we determined Km values for ATP and IC50 values for five inhibitors. To test the extent to which the PKAR mutants mimic Rho-kinase-specificity, IC50 values were measured for the three Rho-kinase-specific inhibitors HA1077, H1152P, and Y-27632, for the PKA-specific inhibitor KT5720, and for the pan-kinase inhibitor staurosporine. The kinetic data of the 72 measurements, conducted in triplicate, and corresponding literature values are presented in Table 2. Additional measurements were made with hydroxyfasudil (HA1100) for PKA-Cα and PKAR3.TABLE 2Overview of Km and IC50 values: comparison of all Km and IC50 values measured for PKA-Cα, eleven PKARs, and Rho-kinase in comparison to literature data for PKA-Cα and Rho-kinaseKm ATPHA1077H1152PY-27632KT5720StaurosporineμmnmμmnmPKA-Cα-lit13aLiterature data were collected from Ishizaki et al.

Neurochem. 2002; 81: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab At first, we validated our kinetic measurements by comparing PKA-Cα and Rho-kinase Km and IC50 values to the corresponding literature values. IC50 values were transformed to Ki values using the Cheng and Prusoff equation (30Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar) to compare our IC50 data to literature Ki data. With the exception of the IC50 for PKA-Cα with H1152P, which deviated from the literature value by a factor of three, all values were within an acceptable range of the literature data (less than a factor of two) (Table 1). As is the case for PKA-Cα and Rho-kinase, measuring staurosporine inhibition in the Cook assay posed a problem, because staurosporine inhibited almost all of our kinases below the detection limit of the system (∼45 nm), and IC50 values are marked accordingly as <45 nm. The kinetic data of PKAR(T183A), PKAR(L49I), PKAR3, and PKAR5 will now be described in more detail. PKAR(T183A) and PKAR(Q181K/T183A)—As we have previously analyzed (22Breitenlechner C. Gassel M. Hidaka H. Kinzel V. Huber R. Engh R.A. Bossemeyer D. Structure. 2003; 11: 1595-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), a PKA to Rho mutation of threonine to alanine at position 183 would enlarge the ATP binding pocket and, consequently, favor binding of similarly enlarged inhibitors, such as H1152P. We made the corresponding mutant PKAR(T183A) and measured the inhibitor binding strengths. In addition, we made the double mutant PKAR(Q181K/T183A) to test whether the expansion of the binding pocket by the T183A mutation could influence the conformation of Gln-181, as seen with PKA to PKB hybrid mutants. Fig. 2 shows the results of Km and IC50 measurements for PKAR(T183A) and PKAR(Q181K/T183A). The IC50 values for PKAR(T183A) and PKAR(Q181K/T183A) with HA1077 and H1152P are very close to the corresponding values for Rho-kinase (Fig. 2A). The IC50 values for PKAR(T183A) and PKAR(Q181K/T183A) with Y-27632 show considerably enhanced binding of the inhibitor compared with PKA-Cα albeit being intermediate between PKA and Rho-kinase. The Km values for ATP of the mutant kinases are also intermediate between the values of PKA-Cα and Rho-kinase. No changes in inhibitor binding between the different enzymes could be measured for the inhibitor staurosporine. The IC50 values for PKAR(T183A) and PKAR(Q181K/T183A) with KT5720 show no apparent differences compared with the corresponding values of PKA-Cα but are in stark contrast to the corresponding value of Rho-kinase (Fig. 2B). The kinetic data of PKAR(T183A) and PKAR(Q181K/T183A) show no significant differences, indicating that there is no refolding of Gln-181 in PKAR(T183A). Taken together, these data confirm that most of the specificity of HA1077 and H1152P for Rho-kinase in contrast to PKA arises from the steric hindrance of Thr-183 in PKA. Removal of the steric hindrance does not, however, significantly affect the binding of the PKA-specific KT5720, for which increased Rho-kinase-like behavior would mean lowered binding strength. Binding of the pankinase inhibitor staurosporine was not measurably affected by the T183A mutation, because the IC50 values for the various proteins remained below 45 nm. PKAR(L49I)—A role for the exchange L49I was, in contrast to T183A, less clear, because there was no net change in side-chain volume. We proposed that an isoleucine residue at position 49 could explain in part Rho-kinase selectivity properties due to the altered shape of the binding surface. As can be seen in Fig. 3A, this may hold true for the binding of the inhibitor HA1077 to PKAR(L49I), because the IC50 value for the L49I mutant PKA was intermediate between the corresponding values of PKA-Cα and Rho-kinase. It appears to hold true especially for KT5720, because the IC50 value for PKAR(L49I) showed binding to be weakened even beyond that of Rho-kinase (Fig. 3B). It follows that the KT5720-pocket shape mismatch in PKAR(L49I) can be partially compensated for by other PKA mutations. PKAR3 (PKAR(L49I/Q181K/T183A))—As described above, the amino acid residue 183 seems to govern specific binding of inhibitors to Rho-kinase (HA1077, H1152P, and Y-27632) and does not affect specific binding of inhibitors to PKA (KT5720). Amino acid residue 49 displays the contrary effect on inhibitor binding, showing little effect on IC50 values for Rho-kinase-specific inhibitors (with the exception of HA1077) and a strong effect on the IC50 value for PKA-specific inhibitors. Regarding the effort to create a surrogate kinase for Rho-kinase, it now seemed plausible to us to build a kinase combining those kinetic features by exchanging residue Thr-183 to alanine, Gln-181 to lysine, and Leu-49 to isoleucine in PKA-Cα, thus creating PKAR3. Fig. 4 (A and B) displays the combined kinetic data for PKAR3. The IC50 values for PKAR3 with HA1077 and H1152P are indeed very close to the corresponding values for Rho-kinase, and to a lesser degree with Y-27632, all with considerably enhanced binding of the inhibitor compared with PKA-Cα. The effect was confirmed by additional measurements of the binding of hydroxyfasudil (HA1100) with PKAR3 (IC50 1.37 μm) and PKA-Cα (IC50 6 μm), reproducing the ratio of Ki values (Rho-kinase 0.56 μm, PKA 2.5 μm) described in the literature (29Ito K.

https://openalex.org/W1977976322,"The expression of the Spi-1/PU.1 transcription factor is tightly regulated as a function of the hematopoietic lineage. It is required for myeloid and B lymphoid differentiation. When overexpressed in mice, Spi-1 is associated with the emergence of transformed proerythroblasts unable to differentiate. In the course of a project undertaken to characterize the oncogenic function of Spi-1, we found that Spi-1 interacts with proteins of the spliceosome in Spi-1-transformed proerythroblasts and participates in alternative splice site selection. Because Spi-1 is a transcription factor, it could be hypothesized that these two functions are coordinated. Here, we have developed a system allowing the characterization of transcription and splicing from a single target. It is shown that Spi-1 is able to regulate alternative splicing of a pre-mRNA for a gene whose transcription it regulates. Using a combination of Spi-1 mutants and Spi-1-dependent promoters, we demonstrate that Spi-1 must bind and transactivate a given promoter to favor the use of the proximal 5' alternative site. This establishes that Spi-1 affects splicing decisions in a promoter binding-dependent manner. These results provide new insight into how Spi-1 may act in the blockage of differentiation by demonstrating that it can deregulate gene expression and also modify the nature of the products generated from target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2095074105,"Somatostatin receptor SST5 is an inhibitory G protein-coupled receptor that exerts a strong cytostatic effect on various cell types. We reported previously that the SST5 anti-proliferative effect results in the inhibition of mitogen-induced increases in intracellular cGMP levels and MAPK activity. This study was conducted to define the early molecular events accountable for the SST5-mediated anti-proliferative effect. Here, we demonstrate that, in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing SST5 (CHO/SST5 cells), somatostatin inhibited cell proliferation induced by nitric oxide donors and overexpression of the neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) protein isoform. Accordingly, nNOS activity and dimerization were strongly inhibited following SST5 activation by the somatostatin analog RC-160. In CHO/SST5 cells, nNOS was dynamically recruited by the SST5 receptor and phosphorylated at tyrosyl residues following RC-160 treatment. RC-160 induced SST5-p60src kinase complex formation and subsequent p60src kinase activation. Coexpression of an inactive p60src kinase mutant with SST5 blocked RC-160-induced nNOS phosphorylation and inactivation and prevented the SST5-mediated anti-proliferative effect. In CHO/SST5 cells, p60src kinase associated with nNOS to induce its inactivation by phosphorylation at tyrosyl residues following RC-160 treatment. Using recombinant proteins, we demonstrated that such phosphorylation prevented nNOS homodimerization. Next, surface plasmon resonance and mutation analysis revealed that p60src directly associated with nNOS phosphorylated Tyr604. SST5-mediated inhibition of nNOS activity was demonstrated to be essential to the RC-160 anti-proliferative effect on pancreatic endocrine tumor-derived cells.

SST5 activation results in inhibition of soluble guanylate cyclase, decreased intracellular cGMP levels, MAPK activity, and cell proliferation of CHO-K1 cells stimulated by cholecystokinin (11Cordelier P. Estève J.-P. Bousquet C. Delesque N. O'Carroll A.-M. Schally A.V. Vaysse N. Susini C. Buscail L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9343-9348Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In mice, SST5 mediates somatostatin inhibition of pancreatic insulin secretion and contributes to the regulation of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity (12Strowski M.Z. Kohler M. Chen H.Y. Trumbauer M.E. Li Z. Szalkowski D. Gopal-Truter S. Fisher J.K. Schaeffer J.M. Blake A.D. Zhang B.B. Wilkinson H.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, deficiency of SST5 leads to subtype-selective sexually dimorphic changes in the expression of both brain and pancreatic somatostatins (13Ramirez J.L. Grant M. Norman M. Wang X.P.

Nitric oxide (NO) regulates a number of physiological processes, including smooth muscle contractility, platelet reactivity, neurotransmission, and the cytotoxic activity of immune cells. Three isoforms of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) that generate NO from l-arginine have been characterized and named according to the cell type or conditions under which they were first identified. Both endothelial NOS and neuronal NOS (nNOS) are constitutively expressed, whereas expression of inducible NOS requires transcriptional activation. Because of its ubiquitous nature, inappropriate release of NO has been linked to a number of pathological conditions. In recent years, a growing body of evidence has depicted NO as a modulator of cell proliferation and/or survival of several normal and tumor systems such as vascular and airway smooth muscle cells, myoblasts, glomerular mesangial cells, pancreatic tumor cells, aortic adventitial fibroblasts, and neuronal cells (14Sarkar R.

Anim. 1999; 35: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, signaling pathways involved in NO-mediated control of cell proliferation are still poorly understood and debated. We identified nNOS as a novel critical partner for somatostatin receptor SST2-induced cell growth arrest (39Lopez F. Ferjoux G. Cordelier P. Saint-Laurent N. Estève J.-P. Vaysse N. Buscail L. Susini C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2300-2302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following SST2 activation by the somatostatin analog RC-160, protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 rapidly recruits nNOS to induce its dephosphorylation at tyrosyl residues and subsequent activation. The resulting NO production activates guanylate cyclase and inhibits cell proliferation of CHO-DG44 cells stably expressing the SST2 receptor (39Lopez F. Ferjoux G. Cordelier P. Saint-Laurent N. Estève J.-P. Vaysse N. Buscail L. Susini C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2300-2302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, somatostatin has been recently demonstrated to modulate NO production through SST1, SST2, and SST3 (40Arena S. Pattarozzi A. Corsaro A. Schettini G. Florio T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, participation of NO in the SST5-mediated signaling pathway is not known. We demonstrated previously that, in CHO-K1 cells, cell proliferation is stimulated through an nNOS/NO/cGMP-dependent pathway elicited by cholecystokinin following protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 activation of nNOS by dephosphorylation at tyrosyl residues (41Cordelier P. Estève J.-P. Rivard N. Marletta M. Vaysse N. Susini C. Buscail L. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2037-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Parallel work from the laboratory demonstrated that treatment of CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the SST5 receptor with the somatostatin analog RC-160 results in a marked reduction of cell proliferation induced by cGMP and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (11Cordelier P. Estève J.-P. Bousquet C. Delesque N. O'Carroll A.-M. Schally A.V. Vaysse N. Susini C. Buscail L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9343-9348Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The present study was conducted to investigate whether somatostatin can act antagonistically in regulating nNOS activity following binding to the SST5 receptor subtype. Molecular mechanisms involved in such regulation and subsequent inhibition of cell proliferation were investigated. Reagents—RC-160, a somatostatin analog, was a kind gift from Dr. A. V.

Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) was from Euromedex (Souffelweyersheim, France). Polyclonal antibody against SST5 was generated in rabbits immunized with peptide EPRPDR, corresponding to amino acids 334–339 of the human SST5 C-terminal end (42Vezzosi D. Bennet A. Rochaix P.

Cell Lines—Human pancreatic carcinoid BON cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS, (1 × 105 units/liter penicillin, 0.5 mg/liter Fungizone, and 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine. CHO-K1 cells were cultured in α-MEM containing 5% FCS. The human SST5 cDNA, subcloned into the pcDNA1/AMP vector (Invitrogen) (3O'Carroll A.-M. Lolait S.J. Konig M. Mahan L.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 939-946PubMed Google Scholar), was stably cotransfected into CHO cells with the pSV2neo vector (Clontech) using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen). Stable transfectants were selected in α-MEM containing Geneticin at 600 μg/ml. Geneticin-resistant clones expressing the SST5 somatostatin receptor (CHO/SST5 cells) were selected by somatostatin binding using [125I-Tyr11]somatostatin-14 as the tracer (43Buscail L. Delesque N. Estève J.-P. Saint-Laurent N. Prats H. Clerc P. Robberecht P. Bell G.I. Liebow C. Schally A.V. Vaysse N. Susini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After selection, cells were cultured in α-MEM containing 5% FCS and 400 μg/ml Geneticin. The pSV2neo vector-alone stable transfectants were used as control clones. All cultures were tested mycoplasma-free. Plasmids and Cell Transfection—Rat nNOS cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. M.

Rouet, INSERM U586, Toulouse, France) to make pCMV5/nNOS, in which nNOS expression is under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. A catalytically inactive p60src mutant (K295R) (44Twamley-Stein G.M. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7696-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) subcloned into the pSGT vector (pSGT/Δp60src) was a generous gift from Dr. S. Roche (Centre de Recherches de Biochimie Macromoléculaire, CNRS, Montpellier, France). The primers used for site-directed mutagenesis of nNOS p60src SH2 domain-binding sites (Y604F) were as follows: 5′-aac tct cga ttc aac atc ctc gag gaa gta gc-3′ and 5′-gct act tcc tcg agg atg ttg aat cga gag tt-3′. Mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. For transient transfection, CHO/SST5 cells were grown for 8hin α-MEM containing 5% FCS. After the α-MEM-containing serum was removed, cells were transfected in low serum-containing medium for 16 h with the pCMV5/nNOS and/or pSGT/Δp60src vector at the concentrations indicated using FuGENE 6 (3 μl/μg of DNA) as described previously (41Cordelier P. Estève J.-P. Rivard N. Marletta M. Vaysse N. Susini C. Buscail L. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2037-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with the pCMV5 vector were used as a control. Under these conditions of transient transfection, the percentage of cells transfected at 24 h was 48 ± 4 (mean ± S.E., n = 3) as quantified by green fluorescent protein expression (driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter) using a VisioLab 2000 image analysis system (Biocom, Paris, France) (41Cordelier P.

Briefly, cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer (60 strokes at 4 °C) in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 20 μm leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 0.1% CHAPS. 25 μg of cellular proteins were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 50 μm l-[14C]arginine (150,000 cpm, specific activity of 58.7 Ci/mmol), 10 mm β-NADPH, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μm FMN, 4 μm FAD, 10 μm BH4, 2 μg of calmodulin, and 1 mm CaCl2 in a final volume of 200 μl. The reaction was terminated by addition of 500 μl of Dowex AG-50W-X8 (sodium form) pre-equilibrated in 50 mm (v/v) Hepes (pH 5.5) overnight at 4 °C. The mixture was gently agitated for 15 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Radioactivity in the supernatant was measured by liquid scintillation counting. BON cells were plated for 24 h in 8-chamber slides at 50 × 103 cells/chamber in DMEM containing 10% FCS (0.25 ml/chamber). Following overnight serum starvation, cells were washed twice with serum-free medium before treatment for 30 min with 10 nm RC-160. Real-time cell-associated NOS activity was monitored using an NOS fluorometric detection system (Sigma) with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope at the times indicated following the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Growth Assay—CHO/SST5 cells were cultured in α-MEM containing 5% FCS and plated in 35-mm diameter dishes at 50 × 103 cells/ml (2 ml/dish). After an overnight attachment phase and/or transient transfection, the cell medium was changed to serum-free α-MEM with or without different agents tested at the times and concentrations indicated. Cell growth was measured after 24 h of culture by cell counting using a Model ZM Coulter counter as described previously (6Buscail L. Estève J.-P. Saint-Laurent N. Bertrand V. Reisine T.

For cell growth assays, treatment with exogenous l-arginine was carried out in l-arginine-free α-MEM. For viability assays, BON cells were plated for 24 h in flat-bottomed 96-well plates at 10 × 103 cells/well in DMEM containing 10% FCS (0.1 ml/well). Following overnight serum starvation, cells were treated in triplicate for 24 h with 100 μl of 10% FCS-containing medium in the presence or absence of RC-160 (10 nm) or the nNOS inhibitor α-guanidinoglutaric acid (0.1 μm). Cell viability was measured at 490 nm using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay (Promega Corp.) following the manufacturer's instructions. p60src Kinase Activity Assay—CHO/SST5 cells were plated in 100-mm diameter dishes at 75 × 103 cells/ml (10 ml/dish) in α-MEM containing 5% FCS. After an 18-h period of serum deprivation and/or transient transfection, cells were or were not treated with RC-160 at the times and concentrations indicated. CHO/SST5 cells were then washed twice with 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.5 mm orthovanadate (buffer A). p60src activity was quantitated as described previously (45Roche S. Koegl M. Barone M.V. Roussel M.F. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some minor modifications. Briefly, cells were scrapped and solubilized at 4 °C for 15 min in buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 2.5 mm EDTA, 20 μm leupeptin, and 1% aprotinin. Supernatant-containing soluble proteins were obtained by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Soluble proteins (250 μg) were incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C without agitation with 0.5 μg of anti-p60src kinase antibody or preimmune serum prebound to protein A-Sepharose beads prewashed with buffer A as a control. The beads were then washed once with buffer A and once with 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm MnCl2 and 1.5 mm orthovanadate (buffer B). The reaction was initiated by addition of 20 μl of buffer B containing 50 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-33P] ATP, and 4 μg of heat-denatured enolase. The reaction was carried out for 15 min at 30 °C and terminated by addition of 30 μl of protein loading buffer containing 3% SDS and β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were air-dried and exposed on a PhosphorImager screen for 16 h. Phosphorylated enolase was visualized using a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare) and quantified by image analysis using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—CHO/SST5 cells were plated in 100-mm diameter dishes at 100 × 103 cells/ml (10 ml/dish) for 8 h in α-MEM containing 5% FCS before transient transfection and serum starvation. BON cells were plated in 100-mm diameter dishes at 150 × 103 cells/ml (10 ml/dish) for 16 h in DMEM containing 10% FCS. Cells were or were not treated with RC-160 with or without other agents tested at the times and concentrations indicated. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and scrapped on ice with 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer C) in the presence of 1.5% CHAPS, 0.05% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate. The mixture was gently agitated for 30 min at 4 °C and thereafter centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Soluble proteins (500 μg to 1 mg) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:100 dilution of polyclonal anti-nNOS, monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine, polyclonal anti-p60src kinase, or polyclonal anti-SST5 antibody prebound to protein A-Sepharose beads prewashed with buffer C in the presence of 0.1% CHAPS, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 0.3% bovine serum albumin (buffer D). Immunoprecipitation with preimmune serum was used as a control. Following incubation, beads were washed twice with buffer D and resuspended in 35 μl of protein loading buffer containing 3% SDS prior to electrophoresis. For immunoblotting, solubilized (50 μg) or immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on 7.5 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels before transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking at room temperature for 2 h in PBS (pH 7.4), 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% dry milk, blots were immunoprobed overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal anti-nNOS (1:1000), polyclonal anti-nNOS (1:500), monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (1:1000), polyclonal anti-human SST5 (1:500), or anti-p60src kinase (1:500) antibody diluted in PBS (pH 7.4), 0.05% Tween 20, and 1% dry milk. The corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Perbio Science, Brebières, France) diluted 1:20,000 in PBS (pH 7.4), 0.05% Tween 20, and 1% dry milk were added, and blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Each antibody incubation was followed by extensive washing with PBS (pH 7.4) and 0.05% Tween 20. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using a SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate system (Perbio Science) and by image analysis using ImageQuant software. To visualize nNOS dimerization, low temperature SDS-PAGE was performed as described (41Cordelier P. Estève J.-P. Rivard N. Marletta M. Vaysse N. Susini C. Buscail L. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2037-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm orthovanadate, 0.05% soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, and 1% CHAPS and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. After addition of protein loading buffer containing 3% SDS under nonreducing conditions, 100 μg of solubilized proteins were resolved by discontinuous gradient 5–15% SDS-PAGE performed at a constant current of 30 mA. Gels and buffers were equilibrated at 4 °C prior to electrophoresis, which was performed below 15 °C. Immunoblotting was performed using monoclonal antihuman nNOS antibody as described previously (41Cordelier P. Estève J.-P. Rivard N. Marletta M. Vaysse N. Susini C. Buscail L.

Surface Plasmon Resonance—The binding kinetics of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were measured with a Biacore 3000 biosensor. Binding of GST fusion protein mass to immobilized peptide was quantified as resonance units, where 1000 resonance units represent 1 ng of protein bound per mm2 of flow cell surface. Samples were diluted in Hank's balanced salt running buffer. 50 resonance units of biotinylated nNOS peptides phosphorylated at either tyrosyl residue 604 or 1336 were immobilized on streptavidin-coated carboxymethylated dextran chips and then subjected to 1–100 nm GST-p60src SH2 domain fusion protein (a kind gift of Dr. S. Roche) at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at 25 °C. GST fusion protein binding to the non-phosphorylated biotinylated peptide was subtracted.

https://openalex.org/W2041704811,"Protein biotinylation and lipoylation are post-translational modifications, in which biotin or lipoic acid is covalently attached to specific proteins containing biotin/lipoyl attachment domains. All the currently reported natural proteins containing biotin/lipoyl attachment domains are multidomain proteins and can only be modified by either biotin or lipoic acid in vivo. We have identified a single domain protein with 73 amino acid residues from Bacillus subtilis strain 168, and it can be both biotinylated and lipoylated in Escherichia coli. The protein is therefore named as biotin/lipoyl attachment protein (BLAP). This is the first report that a natural single domain protein exists as both a biotin and lipoic acid receptor. The solution structure of apo-BLAP showed that it adopts a typical fold of biotin/lipoyl attachment domain. The structure of biotinylated BLAP revealed that the biotin moiety is covalently attached to the side chain of Lys35, and the bicyclic ring of biotin is folded back and immobilized on the protein surface. The biotin moiety immobilization is mainly due to an interaction between the biotin ureido ring and the indole ring of Trp12. NMR study also indicated that the lipoyl group of the lipoylated BLAP is also immobilized on the protein surface in a similar fashion as the biotin moiety in the biotinylated protein.

The biotin/lipoyl attachment domain (IPR000089) is a signature structural motif, which has a conserved lysine residue that can bind biotin or lipoic acid. This domain can be found in enzymes that require biotin or lipoic acid as cofactor (1.Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Biotin plays a catalytic role in carboxyl transfer reactions. It is covalently attached to a lysine residue, via an ϵ-amino group, in enzymes such as pyruvate carboxylase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and propionyl-CoA carboxylase, etc. (2.Alban C. Job D. Douce R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 17-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This process, called biotinylation, is catalyzed by biotin-protein ligase (BPL) 2The abbreviations used are: BPL, biotin-protein ligase; BLAP, biotin/lipoyl attachment protein; LPL, lipoate-protein ligase; BCCP, biotin carboxyl carrier protein; MS, mass spectrometry; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; btl-BLAP, biotinylated BLAP; lpl-BLAP, lipoylated BLAP; WT, wild-type; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy.

Lipoic acid can serve as cofactor in a variety of proteins, such as E2 acyltransferases (E2p) in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and H-protein of the glycine cleavage system (4.Jones D.D.

Biochem. 1996; 236: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is also covalently bound via an amide linkage to a lysine group. This process, named lipoylation, is catalyzed by lipoate-protein ligase (LPL) (1.Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 6.Fujiwara K.

Mammalian biotinyl domain can be biotinylated by bacterial BPL and vice versa. The situation for LPLs is also similar (1.Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The structures of several biotin/lipoyl attachment domains have been determined. Two of them are biotinyl domains, the C-terminal domain of Escherichia coli biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) and the biotinyl domain of 1.3 S subunit of transcarboxylase from Propionibacterium shermanii (7.Athappilly F.K.

All biotinyl domains and lipoyl domains share a very similar overall fold, which is a flattened β-barrel formed by two β-sheets. The conserved lysine residue is located at the tip of a tight β-turn. Although biotinyl and lipoyl domains are quite similar in their three-dimensional structures, there is no natural protein currently reported to be recognized by both BPL and LPL. However, it is found that the biotinyl domain of E. coli BCCP can be lipoylated after its protruding thumb is removed, and the removal does not affect its biotinylation property (16.Reche P.A. Perham R.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2673-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). All the proteins containing a biotin/lipoyl attachment domain, reported so far, are multidomain proteins. The other domains are required for them to be functional (10.Reddy D.V. Shenoy B.C. Carey P.R. Sonnichsen F.D.

Here we report the identification and the structural characterization of a single domain protein (GenBank™ accession number NP_570905) with 73 amino acid residues from Bacillus subtilis strain 168. Because the size of this protein only corresponds to the sizes of the biotin/lipoyl attachment domains and can be both biotinylated and lipoylated in E. coli, we named it as biotin/lipoyl attachment protein (BLAP). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of BLAP—The gene of BLAP was amplified from B. subtilis strain 168 genome by PCR and cloned into protein expression vector pET-21a(+). The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS for protein expression. A single colony of the bacteria was cultured overnight in 2 ml of LB medium at 35 °C, with 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 34 mg/liter chloramphenicol. The cells were collected by centrifugation and transferred into 250 ml of M9 minimal medium to continue incubation. When the cell density reached A600 of 1.0, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm to induce protein expression. d-Biotin was added into M9 medium to express the biotinylated protein, and α-lipoic acid was added for the lipoylated protein production. 15NH4Cl and [13C]glucose were used in M9 medium for preparing 15N/13C-labeled protein samples. BLAP was purified with a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column followed by gel filtration using ACTA fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). Reverse Transcription-PCR—The total mRNA was extracted from cells of B. subtilis strain 168 grown in LB media with 600 mg/liter streptomycin and harvested at A600 of 0.6. Reverse transcription was carried out with 2.5 μg of total RNA using superscript II reverse transcriptase and random hexamers as primers. Real time PCR was performed using the Qiagen SYBR Green™ PCR master mix kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. Each reaction was repeated three times. Western Blot—The primary antibody was from the rabbit serum after 45 days of immunization by four times intramuscular injection of purified recombinant BLAP protein. Anti-Rb IgG (H + L) horseradish peroxidase was used as secondary antibody. Western blot analysis was performed according to the standard method (20.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.60-18.75Google Scholar) with purified BLAP as positive control. NMR Spectroscopy—All the NMR samples contained about 1.2 mm protein in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with 1 mm EDTA and 0.01% NaN3, in 90:10% H2O/D2O. 2,2-Dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid was added as the chemical shift reference. All the NMR spectra were collected at 298 K on a Bruker AVANCE 600 MHz NMR spectrometer. The backbone chemical shift assignments were obtained based on two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC, three-dimensional HNCACB, three-dimensional CBCA(CO)NH, three-dimensional HNCA, and three-dimensional HNCO experiment data, whereas the side chain resonance assignments were obtained from two-dimensional 1H-13C HSQC, three-dimensional HCCH-COSY, three-dimensional HBHA(CO)NH, three-dimensional 15N total correlation spectroscopy-HSQC, three-dimensional HCC(CO)NH, and three-dimensional CC(CO)NH experiment data (21.Sattler M.

The side chain assignments of aromatic residues were obtained based on three-dimensional 13C-NOESY-HSQC experiment data for the aromatic carbons.

Clubb R.T. J. Biomol.

One-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum, two-dimensional NOESY, and double quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy data were used for obtaining the proton chemical shifts of free lipoic acid. The steady state heteronuclear {1H}-15N NOE experiments (25.Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar) were performed in the presence and absence of a 3-s proton pre-saturation period (26.Markley J.L. Horsley W.J. Klein M.P. J. Chem.

All NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipe (28.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NMRView (29.Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). Structure Calculations—The solution structures were calculated using CYANA (30.Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar) and refined with AMBER (31.Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.R. Cheatham III, T.E. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2671) Google Scholar). The distance restraints were obtained from analysis of NOESY data using SANE (32.Duggan B.M. Legge G.B. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 19: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Dihedral angle restraints (φ and ψ) were determined based on analysis results from TALOS (33.Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar) and CSI (34.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). χ1 angles and stereo-specific assignments of Hβ were determined based on NOE intensity information from three-dimensional 15N-NOESY-HSQC and three-dimensional 13C-NOESY-HSQC data. Hydrogen bond constraints were used based on NOE analysis and the secondary structure predictions by CSI. A total of 200 structures was calculated with CYANA, and 100 of them with the lowest target functions were selected for further refinement with AMBER. The final 20 structures with the lowest AMBER energies were selected for structure representation. The final structures were analyzed using MOLMOL (35.Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK-NMR (36.Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4430) Google Scholar). The root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) data were calculated using SUPPOSE (37.Maiti R. Van Domselaar G.H. Zhang H. Wishart D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W590-W594Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The mean structures were generated using SUPPOSE and energy-minimized with AMBER. Cloning and Recombinant Expression of BLAP in E. coli—The DNA fragment encoding BLAP was successfully amplified from the genome DNA of B. subtilis strain 168 and was ligated into pET expression vector. DNA sequencing results showed that the coding sequence of the cloned BLAP gene is identical to the published sequence in the NCBI data base (GenBank™ accession number NC_000964). BLAP was expressed in E. coli with a typical protein yield of 60-80 mg/liter. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis showed that the molecular mass of the purified protein is 7913 Da, which is 128 Da less than the theoretical value. This mass difference is because of the missing of the first methionine, which was confirmed by N-terminal protein sequencing analysis. The MS data indicated that the expressed BLAP is without any post-translational modification. When the bacteria were grown in M9 minimal medium supplied with 40 mg/liter biotin, both apo and biotinylated (btl) BLAP were obtained. Apo-BLAP and btl-BLAP can be separated on an anion exchange column because btl-BLAP has one less positive charge than apo-BLAP. At pH 9.0, btl-BLAP was eluted from the Q-Sepharose column at 80 mm NaCl, and apo-BLAP was eluted at 130 mm NaCl. Interestingly, lipoylated (lpl) BLAP was produced when the cells were cultured in M9 minimal medium with 40 mg/liter lipoic acid. The molecular masses of both btl-BLAP and lpl-BLAP were verified by MS. The molecular weight difference between btl-BLAP and apo-BALP is 225.9 Da and that between lpl-BLAP and apo-BLAP is 188.5 Da. These values agreed with the corresponding theoretical values. The amount of btl-BLAP or lpl-BLAP produced in E. coli is dependent on the incubation time after isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. When the bacteria were incubated for 6.5 h after induction, about 10% BLAP was biotinylated (∼50% lipoylated). When it was elongated to 16 h, about 50% BLAP was biotinylated (∼75% lipoylated). The rates of biotinylation and lipoylation for BLAP in E. coli are comparable with the biotinylation rate of the biotinyl domain of E. coli BCCP and the lipoylation rate of the lipoyl domain of E. coli E2p, respectively (38.Reche P.A. Li Y.-L. Fuller C. Eichhorn K. Perham R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Verification of BLAP Expression in B. subtilis—To determine whether BLAP is expressed in B. subtilis, we first tried to detect the mRNA of BLAP in B. subtilis total mRNA extraction. After reverse transcription, real time PCR was carried out, and the results showed that the mRNA of BLAP has a transcription level close to that of B. subtilis 16 S rRNA gene rrnO (data not shown). The fluorescence threshold was set at 0.02, and the threshold cycle (CT) for BLAP coding sequence and rrnO is 28.8 and 28.2, respectively. Melting curve analysis indicated that the PCR product is a single fraction, which means no nonspecific PCR occurred. Western blot was used to verify the protein expression of BLAP in B. subtilis. Cells of B. subtilis strain 168 were cultured in 500 ml of LB media until the A600 reached 1.5. The bacteria were harvested, and the cells were broken by using a French press. The supernatant was then loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column at pH 9.0, and the fraction eluted with 0.2 m NaCl was collected and concentrated to 0.5 ml. 7.5 μl of this concentrated fraction was used for Western blot analysis. A single band was detected from this sample by immunoblot using multiclonal antibody generated against the recombinant BLAP. This single band appeared at exactly the same position as the purified recombinant BLAP. Solution Structure of Apo-BLAP—Nearly all the chemical shift assignments were obtained for apo-BLAP except for Asn70, whose NH signal was missing in the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum. The solution structure of apo-BLAP was calculated based on NOE, dihedral angle, and hydrogen bond restraints (Table 1). The superimposition of the final 20 structures with the lowest AMBER energies for apo-BLAP, together with a ribbon diagram of the energy minimized mean structure, are shown in Fig. 1. Residues 2-69 of apo-BLAP form a well defined structure, whereas the last four residues are flexible. Structural statistics indicated the solution structure is in very good quality (Table 1).TABLE 1Restraints and structural statistics for apo- and btl-BLAPApo-BLAPbtl-BLAPDistance restraintsIntra-residue (|i - j| = 0)10931191Sequential (|i - j| = 1)678721Medium (2 ≤ |i - j| ≤4)260313Long range (|i - j| ≥5)10031129Ambiguous697806Total37314160Dihedral angle restraintsφ3435ψ3437ϰ14145Total109117Hydrogen bond2830Structure statistics (20 structures)ViolationNOE violation (>0.2 Å)00Maximum NOE violation (Å)0.140Torsion angle violation (>5°)00EnergyMean restraint violation energy (kcal mol−1)2.985.35Mean AMBER energy (kcal mol−1)−3746.74−3890.90PROCHECK statisticsResidues in core regions (%)86.783.9Residues in allowed regions (%)13.315.6Residues in generously allowed regions (%)00.5Residues in disallowed regions (%)00r.m.s.d. from mean structure (residues 2-69)Backbone heavy atoms (Å)0.32 ± 0.070.30 ± 0.10All heavy atoms (Å)0.91 ± 0.130.89 ± 0.14 Open table in a new tab Apo-BLAP adopts a typical biotin/lipoyl attachment domain fold, which is a flat barrel formed by two β-sheets (Fig. 1). Residues 3-4 (β1), 21-22 (β3), 46-47 (β6), 48-51(β7), and 64-68 (β9) form one anti-parallel β-sheet (S1), whereas residues 9-14 (β2), 27-33 (β4), 36-41 (β5), and 58-59 (β8) compose another anti-parallel β-sheet (S2). Strands β4 and β5 are connected by a type III′ β-turn, and the conserved active site MKM residues are located at this β-turn in S2. Lys35 at the tip of this β-turn is fully exposed with its flexible side chain sticking out. Solution Structure of btl-BLAP—We obtained nearly complete chemical shift assignments for btl-BLAP except Val3 and the NH of Asn70. An extra signal appeared in the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of btl-BLAP, which was assigned to the ϵ-NH of the biotin-attached Lys35. Comparing the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of btl-BLAP with that of apo-BLAP, it is found that the backbone NH signal of Lys35 has the largest chemical shift change (Fig. 2). Meanwhile, NH signals from residues near Lys35 (Ile30-Ile38) have significant chemical shift changes because of the biotinylation. Chemical shift changes are also observed for NH signals of residues 7, 9-15, 28, 56, and 60, as well as the NH2 signals of Asn10 (Fig. 2). The 1H chemical shifts of the attached biotin were all assigned and are listed in Table 2 and Structure 1. The attached biotin moiety showed significant 1H chemical shift changes as compared with free biotin. Most of the 1H chemical shifts of the attached biotin are decreased, and generally, those further to the carboxyl group have larger decrease in chemical shift. The chemical shifts for HN3 and one proton of H10 are increased.TABLE 21H chemical shift assignments for free and bound biotinResonanceaThe IUPAC nomenclature for the biotin is as shown in Structure 1.Free biotinbThe chemical shifts are from Ref. 39.Bound biotinHN26.526.09HN36.396.72H54.602.81H44.442.57H63.00, 2.772.32, 2.00H23.352.56H71.71, 1.591.46, 1.17H81.41, 1.411.17, 1.01H91.60, 1.601.56, 1.16H102.19, 2.192.25, 2.12a The IUPAC nomenclature for the biotin is as shown in Structure 1.b The chemical shifts are from Ref. 39.Reddy D.V.

Open table in a new tab The superimposition of the 20 btl-BLAP structures with the lowest AMBER energies is shown in Fig. 3A. The structural statistics for btl-BLAP are listed in Table 1. The structures of apo-BLAP and btl-BLAP are very similar (Fig. 3B). The r.m.s.d. (residues 2-69) for backbone heavy atoms between the mean structures of the two forms is 0.83 Å. The major structural displacement occurs at the end of β4, the biotin-attached turn, and the first half of β5. The β-turn with the attached biotin is converted into a type I′ β-turn from a type III′ β-turn in apo-BLAP. As a result, the end of β4 moves closer to the beginning of β2. The biotinylation of BLAP stabilizes the side chain of Lys35, which leads to the side chain heavy atom r.m.s.d. of Lys35 (not including biotin moiety) for the ensemble of structures reduced from 1.72 Å in apo-BLAP to 0.69 Å in btl-BLAP. Conformation of the Attached Biotin—The biotin moiety is well defined in the btl-BLAP structure. The heavy atom r.m.s.d. from mean for the biotin group is 0.61 Å in the ensemble of structures. The bicyclic ring of the attached biotin is folded back and immobilized on the protein surface, mainly on top of β4. The side chains of Glu32 (on β4) and Glu37 (on β5) are pushed away from the biotin for its bicyclic ring to fit (Fig. 4, A and B). The NH2 signals of Asn10 in the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of btl-BLAP show a very large shift compared with those of apo-BLAP. In the btl-BLAP structure, the side chain of Asn10 moves toward the side chain of Glu32, and the NH2 group of Asn10 is in a position to form a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group of Glu32 in all 20 structures of btl-BLAP. Most interestingly, the indole ring of Trp12 turns almost 90° toward the biotin to face its ureido ring. The conformation changes for the side chains of Asn10 and Trp12 on β2 are probably responsible for the NH chemical shift changes for residues 9-15. The small chemical shift changes observed for NH signals of Val28, Gly56, and Asn60 could be attributed to a secondary effect from the conformation changes of Asn10 and Trp12 side chains, because of the hydrogen bond network of the S2 β-sheet. The binding site of the biotin bicyclic ring is mainly negatively charged (Fig. 3C), and no specific interaction (hydrogen bond, hydrophobic interaction, etc.) between the biotin bicyclic ring and the protein can be identified. Analysis of NOEs between the biotin and the protein showed that all the protons on the biotin bicyclic ring have NOEs with the indole ring of Trp12. The distance between the center of the Trp12 hexagon ring and the center of the biotin ureido ring is about 3.8 Å, and the angle between the planes of the two rings is 29.5° in the mean structure. The protons on the biotin bicyclic ring and those close to this ring, whose chemical shifts decrease significantly, must be within the shielding cone of the indole ring of Trp12. Their chemical shift decreases should be a result of aromatic ring current effect, although the HN3 of biotin is probably located outside of the shielding cone and therefore has an increased chemical shift. The distances between H10 protons and the centers of either the pentagon or the hexagon rings of the indole group are over 10 Å. Therefore, the chemical shift changes for H10 are probably related to local conformation change because of the immobilization of biotin. The steady state heteronuclear {1H}-15N NOE value of the ϵ-NH of Trp12 changes from 0.50 ± 0.02 in apo-BLAP to 0.71 ± 0.02 in btl-BLAP. This indicates that the motion of the indole ring is somewhat restricted upon the attachment of biotin. As only this indole ring moved toward biotin and all other nearby side chains moved away, we suspected that the immobilization of the biotin is mainly due to an interaction between the Trp12 indole ring and the biotin ureido ring. To test this hypothesis, we mutated Trp12 to a methionine (W12M) and studied the W12M BLAP mutant with NMR. Comparing the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of wild-type (WT) apo-BLAP with that of W12M apo-BLAP, it was found that all residues with significant NH chemical shift changes are located near the mutated residue 12 (Fig. 5A). Comparison of 1Hα chemical shifts between W12M apo-BLAP and WT apo-BLAP showed that the 1Hα chemical shift differences for most residues are smaller than 0.02 ppm, except that the 1Hα chemical shift differences for Lys13 and Glu37 are over 0.13 ppm. In addition, residue 12 has the largest 1Hα chemical shift change (0.38 ppm) because of the W12M mutation. These indicate that the W12M mutation causes little structural change to the protein. In the structure of WT apo-BLAP, the side chains of Lys13 and Glu37 are flanking the indole ring of Trp12. The large NH chemical shift changes of Lys13 and Glu37 are caused by the mutation of this aromatic residue. The W12M mutation did not cause any change to the protein biotinylation in E. coli. Fig. 5B shows the overlay of the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra of W12M apo- and btl-BLAP. For W12M BLAP, biotinylation only causes chemical shift changes for the backbone NH signals of residues at the biotin-attaching site, residues 34-37. Unlike the situation in WT BLAP, the backbone NH chemical shifts for residues 9-15 in W12M BLAP almost have no change upon biotinylation. The NH2 signals of Asn10 are shifted upon biotinylation, but the scales of change are much smaller than those in WT BLAP. In addition, the steady state heteronuclear {1H}-15N NOE value of the ϵ-NH of Lys35 is -0.54 ± 0.02 for W12M btl-BLAP, whereas it is 0.54 ± 0.02 for WT btl-BLAP. These values imply that the biotin moiety and the side chain of Lys35 are flexible in W12M btl-BLAP, and it is a result of a single residue mutation, W12M. Indeed, the interaction between the indole ring of Trp12 and the biotin ureido ring is responsible for the immobilization of the biotin moiety in WT BLAP. The nature of this interaction is probably electrostatic interaction. NMR Study of lpl-BLAP—Backbone resonance assignments were carried out for lpl-BLAP. Except that Asn70 lacked an NH signal, all the possible backbone NH and side chain NH2 resonances in the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum were assigned. The ϵ-NH signal of the lipoate attached Lys35 was also identified (Fig. 6). Similar to btl-BLAP, the residues with obvious NH chemical shift changes because of lipoylation mainly exist in two regions as follows: one is near Lys35 (Ile30, Glu32-Ile38) and the other is near Trp12 (Asn10-Lys13). Val14, Gly56, and Asn60 also show small chemical shift changes. The residues with obvious chemical shift variations because of biotinylation or lipoylation are almost identical. Actually, the NH chemical shift differences between lpl-BLAP and btl-BLAP are much smaller than those between them and the apo-BLAP for residues with very large NH chemical shift changes (residues 10δ, 35 and 36) (Fig. 6). The 1H chemical shifts of the attached and free lipoic acid were also assigned (Table 3 and Structure 2). All the 1H chemical shifts are decreased for the attached lipoic acid compared with those of the free lipoic acid except for H9. Those further from the carboxyl group have larger chemical shift changes. This is similar to the case of the attached biotin in btl-BLAP. The significant chemical shift decreases are probably also because of the ring current effect of Trp12.TABLE 31H chemical shift assignments for free and bound lipoic acidResonanceaThe IUPAC nomenclature for the biotin is given in Structure 2.Chemical shift (ppm)Free lipoic acidbChemical shifts for free lipoic acid was determined in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7, at 298 K.Bound lipoic acidH33.18, 3.252.09, 2.43H42.00, 2.491.14, 1.72H53.723.33H61.76, 1.641.20, 1.17H71.42, 1.421.17, 1.04H81.58, 1.581.55, 1.45H92.18, 2.182.19, 2.17a The IUPAC nomenclature for the biotin is given in Structure 2.b Chemical shifts for free lipoic acid was determined in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7, at 298 K. Open table in a new tab The steady state heteronuclear {1H}-15N NOE value of the ϵ-NH of Trp12 increases from 0.50 ± 0.02 in apo-BLAP to 0.61 ± 0.02 in lpl-BLAP. Therefore, we believe that the attached lipoate moiety is also immobilized on the protein surface, and it is in a similar conformation as the attached biotin in btl-BLAP. We suspected that the immobilization of lipoate moiety is also mainly due to an electrostatic interaction between the rings of lipoic acid and Trp12. The Existence of BLAP—The B. subtilis BLAP (GenBank™ accession number NP_570905) was initially annotated as a BCCP. Unlike other bacterial BCCPs that normally have 150-160 amino acid residues, BLAP is only 73 residues in length. So its size is about the same as those of biotinyl domains of bacterial BCCPs. The sequence identities between BLAP and the biotinyl domains of BCCPs of B. subtilis and E. coli are 23.9 and 26.1%, respectively. The entry for GenBank™ accession number NP_570905 was later discontinued in the NCBI protein data base after we have cloned the gene of BLAP. In this study, we have proved the existence of BLAP in B. subtilis at both the mRNA level and the protein level. About 30 homologous protein sequences were found when we searched the nonredundant protein data base with the B. subtilis BLAP sequence on Biology Workbench. These protein sequences all have over 60% positive matches with the B. subtilis BLAP, and their sequence lengths are all less than 90 amino acid residues (Fig. 7). The MKM motif and the glutamic acid at the -3 position with respect to the target lysine, which is very important for biotinylation, are highly conserved (Fig. 7). All of them are from prokaryotes, except one is from Danio rerio (GenBank™ accession number XP_701405). Therefore, BLAP is not only restricted to B. subtilis but also exists in other species. Immobilization of the Biotin—The bicyclic ring of biotin is also attached on the protein surface near the protruding thumb of the biotinyl domain of E. coli BCCP (7.Athappilly F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It was first proposed that a hydrogen bond between the HN2 of biotin and the Oγ of Thr94 was the reason for the immobilization of biotin based on the crystal structure (7.Athappilly F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), although NMR study results of the biotinyl domain of E. coli BCCP did not support this hydrogen bond in solution structure (9.Roberts E.L. Shu N. Howard M.J. Broadhurst R.W. Chapman-Smith A. Wallace J.C. Morris T. Cronan Jr., J.E. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5045-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the immobilization of the attached biotin in E. coli BCCP was generally attributed to the interaction between biotin and the protruding thumb (8.Yao X. Wei D. Soden J.C. Summers M.F. Beckett D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15089-15100Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 9.Roberts E.L. Shu N. Howard M.J. Broadhurst R.W. Chapman-Smith A. Wallace J.C. Morris T. Cronan Jr., J.E. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5045-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10.Reddy D.V. Shenoy B.C. Carey P.R. Sonnichsen F.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2509-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). By Examining the structure of the biotinylated biotinyl domain of E. coli BCCP, we found that Tyr92 of E. coli BCCP is in a similar position to Trp12 of btl-BLAP. The phenyl ring of Tyr92 in E. coli BCCP is also facing the ureido ring of biotin, and the distance between the centers of the two rings is 3.7 Å (Fig. 4C). In addition, it is also reported that extensive NOEs have been observed between the phenyl ring of Tyr92 and every proton of the biotin bicyclic ring (9.Roberts E.L. Shu N. Howard M.J. Broadhurst R.W. Chapman-Smith A. Wallace J.C. Morris T. Cronan Jr., J.E. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5045-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Based on this information, we propose that the immobilization of the biotin moiety in E. coli BCCP is also because of an interaction between the phenyl ring of Tyr92 and the biotin ureido ring, similar to the case for btl-BLAP described above. On the other hand, it has been reported that the attached biotin is flexible in the biotinyl domain of the 1.3 S subunit of transcarboxylase from P. shermanii (39.Reddy D.V. Shenoy B.C. Carey P.R. Sonnichsen F.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14676-14682Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The structure of the biotinyl domain of the 1.3 S subunit shows that there is no aromatic residue in similar positions as Trp12 of BLAP or Tyr92 of E. coli BCCP (Fig. 4D). This should explain the flexibility of the attached biotin in the biotinyl domain of the 1.3 S subunit. Substrate Recognition by BPL and LPL—Although biotinyl domains and lipoyl domains share a very similar overall fold, it is a general belief that BPL and LPL enzymes can distinguish biotinyl and lipoyl domains as substrates (1.Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Several studies have been carried out to reveal the mechanisms for the enzyme specificities of BPL and LPL (16.Reche P.A. Perham R.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2673-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 38.Reche P.A. Li Y.-L. Fuller C. Eichhorn K. Perham R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 40.Wallis N.G. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 41.Chapman-Smith A. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1449-1457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis study has shown that removing the protruding thumb, which lipoyl domains do not have, from the biotinyl domain of E. coli BCCP made it an efficient substrate for LPL, and it still retained the ability to be recognized by BPL (16.Reche P.A. Perham R.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2673-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). So the protruding thumb of E. coli BCCP prevents it from being lipoylated. Also, based on sequence and structure comparisons, it has been proposed that loop 1 between strands 1 and 2 is responsible for BPL not recognizing lipoyl domains (42.Polyak S.W. Chapman-Smith A. Mulhern T.D. Cronan Jr., J.E. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3037-3045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This loop in lipoyl domains is generally a few residues longer than that in biotinyl domains. BLAP can be both biotinylated and lipoylated, which indicates that it has the structural characteristics recognized by both BPL and LPL. In Fig. 8, the structure of BLAP is compared with two biotinyl domain structures and three lipoyl domain structures. The fact that BLAP lacks the protruding thumb and has shorter loop 1 makes it a good substrate for both BPL and LPL. The protruding thumb of the biotinyl domain of E. coli BCCP is not a common feature for all biotinyl domains. It only exists in the biotinyl domains of bacterial acetyl-CoA carboxylase (1.Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Other biotinyl domains, such as that of the 1.3 S subunit from P. shermanii, have much shorter loops at the corresponding places, as does BLAP. It is possible that this kind of biotinyl domain can also be an effective substrate for LPL. Biological Implications—Being both biotinylated and lipoylated efficiently does not mean that BLAP is involved in carboxylase or dehydrogenase complex, as the biotin/lipoate attachment domain cannot function independently. The N domain and the linker fragment of E. coli BCCP are indispensable for the assembly and function of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex in vivo (10.Reddy D.V. Shenoy B.C. Carey P.R. Sonnichsen F.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2509-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18.Choi-Rhee E. Cronan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30806-30812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Similarly, an active dehydrogenase can never assemble if it lacks the binding domain and the catalytic domain on the E2 component (19.de Kok A. Hengeveld A.F. Martin A. Westphal A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1385: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because BLAP is a single domain protein, its biological function should be different from currently known biotinyl/lipoyl domain-containing proteins. The fact that BLAP can be both biotinylated and lipoylated in E. coli suggests that it can compete with the biotinyl/lipoyl domain-containing proteins for biotin or lipoic acid. Thus, it is possible for BLAP to play some kind of regulatory role. In summary, we have identified a new protein (BLAP) from B. subtilis that can be both biotinylated and lipoylated. Unlike all other biotin/lipoyl attachment domain-containing proteins, it is a single domain protein. However, its biological function is still not clear, and further studies are needed to reveal the biological role of BLAP.
