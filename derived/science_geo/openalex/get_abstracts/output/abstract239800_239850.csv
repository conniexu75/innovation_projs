https://openalex.org/W2061070237,"Wound healing and cancer are both characterized by cell proliferation, remodeling of extracellular matrix, cell invasion and migration, new blood vessel formation, and modulation of blood coagulation. The mechanisms that link wound healing and cancer are poorly understood. We report here that Stat3, a common signaling mechanism involved in oncogenesis and tissue injury, regulates a common set of genes involved in wound healing and cancer. Using oligonucleotide gene arrays and quantitative real-time PCR, we evaluated changes in global gene expression resulting from expression of Stat3 in lung epithelial cells. We report here previously uncharacterized genes induced by Stat3 implicated in signaling pathways common to both wound healing and cancer including cell invasion and migration, angiogenesis, modulation of coagulation, and repression of interferon-inducible genes. Consistent with these results, we found increased Stat3 activity associated with wound healing in chronically inflamed mouse lungs and increased Stat3 activity was identified at the leading edge of lung tumors invading adjacent nontumor stroma. These findings provide a molecular basis for understanding cancer as a deregulation of normal wound healing processes."

https://openalex.org/W1984376253,"Telomerase represents a relevant target for cancer therapy. Molecules able to stabilize the G-quadruplex (G4), a structure adopted by the 3′-overhang of telomeres, are thought to inhibit telomerase by blocking its access to telomeres. We investigated the cellular effects of four new 2,6-pyridine-dicarboxamide derivatives displaying strong selectivity for G4 structures and strong inhibition of telomerase in in vitro assays. These compounds inhibited cell proliferation at very low concentrations and then induced a massive apoptosis within a few days in a dose-dependent manner in cultures of three telomerase-positive glioma cell lines, T98G, CB193 and U118-MG. They had also antiproliferative effects in SAOS-2, a cell line in which telomere maintenance involves an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism. We show that apoptosis was preceded by multiple alterations of the cell cycle: activation of S-phase checkpoints, dramatic increase of metaphase duration and cytokinesis defects. These effects were not associated with telomere shortening, but they were directly related to telomere instability involving telomere end fusion and anaphase bridge formation. Pyridine-based G-quadruplex ligands are therefore promising agents for the treatment of various tumors including malignant gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2087636717,"Aneurysmal bone cysts (ABC) are locally aggressive bone tumors that often feature chromosome 17p13 rearrangements. One of the ABC 17p13 rearrangements – t(16;17)(q22;p13) – was recently shown to create a CDH11-USP6 fusion in which the USP6/TRE17 oncogene is overexpressed through juxtaposition with the CDH11 promoter. Herein, we characterize four different ABC translocations involving 17p13, and we show that each is associated with a novel USP6 fusion oncogene. Specifically, we demonstrate that t(1;17), t(3;17), t(9;17), and t(17;17) result in USP6 fusions with TRAP150 (thyroid receptor-associated protein 150), ZNF9 (ZiN c Finger 9), Osteomodulin, and COL1A1 (Collagen 1A1), respectively. The oncogenic mechanism in these fusion genes is akin to CDH11-USP6, with the USP6 coding sequences juxtaposed to the promoter regions in each of the four novel translocation partners. The novel fusion partners appear well suited to drive USP6 transcription in the bone/mesenchymal context: osteomodulin is expressed strongly in osteoblastic lineages, and the COL1A1 promoter has an oncogenic role in the mesenchymal cancer dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. In summary, these studies show that USP6 oncogenic activation results from heterogeneous genomic mechanisms involving USP6 transcriptional upregulation by juxtaposition with ectopic promoters."

Hormone resistance of prostate cancer develops, in part, from upregulation of antiapoptotic genes after androgen deprivation. Given the accumulating evidence that Survivin, a new member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family, is associated with both cancer progression and drug resistance, we hypothesized that Survivin plays a potentially important role in hormone therapy resistance, and that targeting of Survivin may enhance sensitivity to antiandrogen therapy in prostate cancer. Patterns of Survivin expression were assessed in three prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, PC-3, and DU-145 using quantitative Western analysis. All three cell lines were found to strongly express Survivin. In LNCaP cells with intact androgen receptors (ARs), it was observed that androgen stimulation with 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) increased Survivin expression. Conversely, treatment with Flutamide decreased Survivin expression in LNCaP cells. We next studied the functional effect of Survivin on sensitivity to Flutamide. LNCaP cells were infected with replication-deficient adenoviruses encoding either wild-type Survivin pAd-S(WT) or a phosphorylation-defective Survivin Thr34 → Ala dominant-negative mutant pAd-S(T34A), and then treated with Flutamide. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed in vitro and in vivo. It was determined that Survivin can mediate resistance to such antiandrogen therapies based on our assays. Direct androgen stimulation resulted in pan-cell cycle expression of Survivin, which was found to be mediated by AKT, as it was determined that exogenous insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a known activator of AKT signaling, could increase Survivin expression and result in pan-cell cycle expression even in AR-negative prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and DU-145. Given this alternative mechanism of Survivin expression and our findings that Survivin can mediate resistance to Flutamide treatment, we further investigated whether IGF-1-mediated activation of Survivin via AKT could mediate resistance to antiandrogen therapy. Both in vitro and in vivo, this was found to be the case, supporting a novel mechanism of resistance to antiandrogen therapy. Our study indicates that upregulation of Survivin via IGF-1 signaling confers resistance to Flutamide in prostate cancer cells. Targeted inhibition of Survivin appears to enhance the therapeutic effects of Flutamide in vitro and in vivo, revealing a novel strategy to enhance sensitivity to androgen ablation therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1969534054,"Aberrant Wnt signaling, mainly through mutations of APC and in some cases of CTNNB1 or AXIN2, has been found in the majority of colorectal cancers. Recently, frequent promoter hypermethylation was identified to cause silencing of the secreted frizzled-related protein (sFRP) family in colorectal cancer. Restoration of sFRP in colorectal cancer cells attenuates Wnt signaling even in the presence of downstream mutations. Here we show that Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF-1), a different secreted antagonist of Wnt signaling, is also silenced by promoter hypermethylation in colorectal cancer cells. Restoration of WIF-1 function, Wnt-1 siRNA, or a monoclonal anti-Wnt-1 antibody that we developed attenuates Wnt-1 signaling and induces significant apoptosis in these cells containing downstream mutations and expressing Wnt-1. In addition, this monoclonal anti-Wnt-1 antibody showed synergistic effects with docetaxel in treating these colorectal cancer cells and great efficacy in treating primary colorectal cancer cultures freshly prepared from patients. Therefore, our data support the hypothesis that constitutive Wnt signaling may be required to complement downstream mutations in the evolution of colorectal cancer. Furthermore, our results suggest that blockade of the Wnt signal may have a therapeutic role in the treatment of colorectal cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2069603887,"The SNAIL-related zinc-finger transcription factor, SLUG (SNAI2), is critical for the normal development of neural crest-derived cells and loss-of-function SLUG mutations have been proven to contribute to piebaldism and Waardenburg syndrome type 2 in a dose-dependent fashion. While aberrant induction of SLUG has been documented in cancer cells, relatively little is known about the consequences of SLUG overexpression in malignancy. To investigate the potential role of SLUG overexpression in development and in cancer, we generated mice carrying a tetracycline-repressible Slug transgene. These mice were morphologically normal at birth, and developed mesenchymal tumours (leukaemia and sarcomas) in almost all cases examined. Suppression of the Slug transgene did not rescue the malignant phenotype. Furthermore, the BCR–ABL oncogene, which induces Slug expression in leukaemic cells, did not induce leukaemia in Slug-deficient mice, implicating Slug in BCR–ABL leukaemogenesis in vivo. Overall, the findings indicate that while Slug overexpression is not sufficient to cause overt morphogenetic defects in mice, they demonstrate a specific and critical role for Slug in the pathogenesis of mesenchymal tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2083941386,"Neuroblastoma is the second most common pediatric malignancy, characterized by a high rate of unexplained spontaneous remissions. Much progress has been made in understanding neuroblastoma differentiation triggered by certain agents such as retinoic acid. However, little is known about the signalling pathways that lead to differentiation of neuroblastoma cells due to serum withdrawal. We found that in Neuro2a neuroblastoma cells, EGFR, ERK1/2 and Akt showed increased phosphorylation after serum withdrawal, and that the activation of EGFR was necessary for the activation of Akt and ERK1/2. Inhibition of EGFR, ERK1/2 and PI3K blocked neuroblastoma differentiation after serum withdrawal. Interestingly, addition of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) abrogated serum-withdrawal induced neuroblastoma differentiation, as well as the activation of EGFR. Our results demonstrate a novel role for serum-derived lipoproteins in the control of receptor tyrosine kinase activity."

https://openalex.org/W2133406385,"Microsatellite instability (MSI) occurs in most hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancers (HNPCC) and less frequently in sporadic tumors as the result of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency. Instability at coding microsatellites (cMS) in specific target genes causes frameshift mutations and functional inactivation of affected proteins, thereby providing a selective growth advantage to MMR deficient cells. At present, little is known about Selective Target Gene frameshift mutations in preneoplastic lesions. In this study, we examined 30 HNPCC-associated MSI-H colorectal adenomas of different grades of dysplasia for frameshift mutations in 26 cMS-bearing genes, which, according to our previous model, represent Selective Target genes of MSI. About 30% (8/26) of these genes showed a high mutation frequency (> or =50%) in colorectal adenomas, similar to the frequencies reported for colorectal carcinomas. Mutations in one gene (PTHL3) occurred significantly less frequently in MSI adenomas compared to published mutation rates in MSI carcinomas (36.0 vs 85.7%, P=0.023). Biallelic inactivation was observed in nine genes, thus emphasizing the functional impact of cMS instability on MSI tumorigenesis. Some genes showed a high frequency of frameshift mutations already at early stages of MSI colorectal tumorigenesis that increased with grade of dysplasia and transition to carcinoma. These include known Target Genes like BAX and TGFBR2, as well as three novel candidates, MACS, NDUFC2, and TAF1B. Overall, we have identified genes of potential relevance for the initiation and progression of MSI tumorigenesis, thus representing promising candidates for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches directed towards MMR-deficient tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2113829215,"Treatment of the breast cancer cell line, MDAMB468 with the DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-azacytidine (5-AzaC) results in growth arrest, whereas the growth of the normal breast epithelial line DU99 (telomerase immortalized) is relatively unaffected. Comparing gene expression profiles of these two lines after 5-AzaC treatment, we identified 36 genes that had relatively low basal levels in MDAMB468 cells compared to the DU99 line and were induced in the cancer cell line but not in the normal breast epithelial line. Of these genes, 33 have associated CpG islands greater than 300 bp in length but only three have been previously described as targets for aberrant methylation in human cancer. Northern blotting for five of these genes (α-Catenin, DTR, FYN, GADD45a, and Zyxin) verified the array results. Further analysis of one of these genes, GADD45a, showed that 5-AzaC induced expression in five additional breast cancer cell lines with little or no induction in three additional lines derived from normal breast epithelial cells. The CpG island associated with GADD45a was analysed by bisulfite sequencing, sampling over 100 CpG dinucleotides. We found that four CpG's, located approximately 700 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site are methylated in the majority of breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors but not in DNA from normal breast epithelia or matched lymphocytes from cancer patients. Therefore, this simple method of dynamic transcriptional profiling yielded a series of novel methylation-sensitive genes in breast cancer including the BRCA1 and p53 responsive gene, GADD45a."
https://openalex.org/W2022386076,"Replication-competent oncolytic viruses are being developed for human cancer therapy. We previously reported that an attenuated adenovirus (OBP-301, ‘Telomelysin’), in which the hTERT promoter element drives expression of E1A and E1B genes linked with an IRES, could replicate in cancer cells, and causes selective lysis of cancer cells. We further constructed OBP-405 (‘Telomelysin-RGD’) that contains an RGD motif in the HI loop of the fiber knob. We examined whether OBP-405 could be effective in overcoming the limitations of OBP-301, specifically their inefficient infection into cells lacking the primary receptor, the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR). By flow cytometric analysis, H1299 (lung) and SW620 (colorectal) tumor cells showed high levels of CAR expression, whereas LN444 (glioblastoma), LNZ308 (glioblastoma), and H1299-R5 (lung) tumor cells were negative for CAR expression. A quantitative real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that fiber-modified OBP-405 infected more efficiently than OBP-301, although the intracellular replication rate of both viruses was consistent. The comparative antitumor effect of fiber-modified OBP-405 and unmodified OBP-301 for human cancer cells was evaluated in vitro by XTT assay as well as in vivo by using athymic mice carrying xenografts. OBP-405 had a profound oncolytic effect on human cancer cell lines compared to OBP-301, in particular on cells with low CAR expression. Intratumoral injection of 107 plaque-forming units of OBP-405 into CAR-negative H1299-R5 lung tumor xenografts in nu/nu mice resulted in a significant inhibition of tumor growth and long-term survival in all treated mice. Moreover, selective replication of OBP-405 in the distant, uninjected H1299-R5 tumors was demonstrated. Our results suggest that fiber-modified replication-competent adenovirus OBP-405 exhibits a broad target range by increasing infection efficiency, an outcome that has important implications for the treatment of human cancers."

https://openalex.org/W2039871999,"Vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin is exclusively expressed at interendothelial junctions of normal and tumour vessels. In this report, we characterized the transcriptional activity of the human VE-cadherin promoter. Transient transfection assays revealed that sequences at positions −1135/−744 and −166/−5 base pairs are critical for promoter activity in endothelial cells. We show that specific sequences in the proximal region interact with Ets and Sp1 family members. Transgenic mice were created and the human VE-cadherin promoter was able to confer correct temporal and spatial expression on the LacZ gene in embryos. In adults, the transgene was specifically and strongly expressed in the lung, heart, ovary, spleen and kidney glomeruli, whereas expression was weak or absent in the vasculature of other organs, including the brain, thymus, liver and skeletal muscle. Neovessels in tumour grafts and Matrigel implants harboured strong stainings, indicating that promoter activity is enhanced in angiogenic situations. Furthermore, Matrigel and transfection assays showed that VE-cadherin promoter is subjected to bFGF induction. Transgene expression was also noticed in extravascular sites of the central nervous system, suggesting that silencer elements may be located elsewhere in the gene. These results are a first step towards addressing the organ- and tumour-specific regulation of the VE-cadherin gene."
https://openalex.org/W2066289540,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is linked to poor outcome in breast cancer, and resistance to hormonal therapy is often accompanied by activation of growth factor receptors. To investigate the mechanism(s) by which EGFR becomes activated in breast cancer, we screened a cDNA expression library for genes that mediate EGF-independent proliferation of human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). We isolated the NSEP1 cDNA encoding Y-box-binding protein 1 (YB-1), a multifunctional transcriptional and translational regulator. This cDNA conferred growth factor independence to HMECs. YB-1-transduced cells overexpressed EGFR, but ErbB-2 (Her-2/neu) levels were unchanged. Moreover, EGFR was constitutively phosphorylated in the absence of exogenous ligand. In these cells, an EGFR-blocking antibody failed to inhibit proliferation, conditioned medium activity could not be detected, and the synthesis of EGFR ligands was reduced compared to parental cells. This suggests that EGFR is activated in a ligand-independent fashion. However, cell growth could be blocked with an ErbB kinase inhibitor, indicating that EGFR signaling plays a major role in YB-1-induced growth factor independence. Taken together, our results demonstrate that YB-1 overexpression can induce EGF independence in HMECs via activation of the EGFR pathway. This could represent one of the mechanisms by which YB-1 contributes to breast tumor aggressiveness."

https://openalex.org/W2047841120,"The E2F1 transcription factor regulates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis and DNA repair. Following DNA damage, E2F1 is phosphorylated and stabilized, but the physiological role of E2F1 in the response to DNA damage is unclear. We find that mice lacking E2F1 have increased levels of epidermal apoptosis compared to wild-type mice following exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. Moreover, transgenic overexpression of E2F1 in basal layer keratinocytes suppresses apoptosis induced by UVB. Inhibition of UVB-induced apoptosis by E2F1 is unexpected given that most studies have demonstrated a proapoptotic function for E2F1. E2F1-mediated suppression of apoptosis does not involve alterations in mitogen-activated protein kinase activation or Bcl-2 downregulation in response to UVB and is independent of p53. Instead, inhibition of UVB-induced apoptosis by E2F1 correlates with a stimulation of DNA repair. Mice lacking E2F1 are impaired for the removal of DNA photoproducts, while E2F1 transgenic mice repair UVB-induced DNA damage at an accelerated rate compared to wild-type mice. These findings suggest that E2F1 participates in the response to UVB by promoting DNA repair and suppressing apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2085799419,"The S-phase kinase-associated protein-2 (SKP2) plays a key role in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, which results in the progression of cells from a quiescence to proliferative state. SKP2 is overexpressed in a variety of tumors. In this study, we used small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to inhibit the SKP2 expression in lung cancer cells and thereby investigate the role of SKP2 in lung tumorigenesis. Three lung cancer cell lines were transfected with siRNAs targeted against SKP2. SKP2-siRNAs specifically and efficiently reduced the levels of the SKP2 protein by 90% 48 h after transfection in all cell lines. In the A549 and H1792 cells, p27 expression was increased and the increase was inversely proportional to the level of SKP2; cell proliferation was reduced to 12 and 28%, respectively; apoptosis was increased to 36 and 30%, respectively; 36 and 28% of cells accumulated in the sub-G1 phase, respectively; and the population of cells in the G1 phase was decreased to 37 and 41%, respectively. In addition, the SKP2-depleted A549 and H1792 cells showed decreased levels of cyclin E/CDK2. Correspondingly, only 4 and 6% of the treated A549 and H1792 cells had multiple centrosomes, respectively, compared with 43 and 46% of the control cells, respectively. These results imply that SKP2 plays an oncogenic role in lung cancer and that SKP2 silencing may be useful in the treatment of lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1993920050,"Germline mutations in the BRCA1 gene are associated with an increased susceptibility to the development of breast and ovarian cancers. Evidence suggests that BRCA1 protein plays a key role in mediating DNA damage-induced checkpoint responses. Several studies have shown that ectopic expression of BRCA1 in human cells can trigger cellular responses similar to those induced by DNA damage, including G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. While the effects of ectopic BRCA1 expression on the G2/M transition and apoptosis have been extensively studied, the factors that dictate the balance between these two responses remain poorly understood. We have recently shown that ectopic expression of BRCA1 in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells resulted in activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and G2/M cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, inhibition of BRCA1-induced ERK1/2 activation using mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 and 2 (MEK1/2)-specific inhibitors resulted in increased apoptosis, suggesting a potential role of ERK1/2 kinases in BRCA1-mediated G2/M checkpoint response. In this study, we assessed the role of ERK1/2 kinases in the regulation of BRCA1-mediated G2/M cell cycle arrest. Results indicate that BRCA1-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and ERK1/2 activation correlate with changes in the level and/or activity of several key regulators of the G2/M checkpoint, including activation of Chk1 and Wee1 kinases, induction of 14-3-3, and down-regulation of Cdc25C. Furthermore, inhibition of ERK1/2 kinases using MEK1/2-specific inhibitors results in a marked attenuation of the BRCA1-induced G2/M arrest. Biochemical studies established that ERK1/2 inhibition abolished the effects of BRCA1 on components of the G2/M checkpoint, including regulation of Cdc25C expression and activation of Wee1 and Chk1 kinases. These results implicate a critical role of ERK1/2 signaling in the regulation of BRCA1 function on controlling the G2/M checkpoint responses."

https://openalex.org/W2078280660,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a distinct subtype of acute myeloid leukemia characterized by a block of differentiation at the promyelocytic stage. APL patients respond to pharmacological concentrations of all-trans retinoic acid (RA) and disease remission correlates with terminal differentiation of leukemic blasts. The PML/RAR oncogenic transcription factor is responsible for both the pathogenesis of APL and for its sensitivity to RA. In order to identify physiological targets of RA therapy, we analysed gene expression profiles of RA-treated APL blasts and found 1056 common target genes. Comparing these results to those obtained in RA-treated U937 cell lines revealed that transcriptional response to RA is largely dependent on the expression of PML/RAR. Several genes involved in the control of differentiation and stem cell renewal are early targets of RA regulation, and may be important effectors of RA response. Modulation of chromatin modifying genes was also observed, suggesting that specific structural changes in local chromatin domains may be required to promote RA-mediated differentiation. Computational analysis of upstream genomic regions in RA target genes revealed nonrandom distribution of transcription factor binding sites, indicating that specific transcriptional regulatory complexes may be involved in determining RA response."

https://openalex.org/W2046554377,"A variety of experimental evidence including findings in various mouse models indicates that the BCR-ABL oncogene is the cause of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Since normal hematopoietic cells in marrow and spleen are replaced with proliferating leukemic blasts, we determined whether this is an active process mediated by the leukemia cells. The lipocalin 24p3 was reported to be secreted by mouse hematopoietic cells deprived of IL-3, resulting in apoptosis induction in a variety of hematopoietic cells including bone marrow cells. Here, we show that BCR-ABL+ mouse hematopoietic cells induced persistent expression and secretion of 24p3. Importantly, BCR-ABL+ hematopoietic cells were resistant to the apoptotic effects of 24p3. The expression of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein and its tyrosine kinase were required for induction of 24p3 expression. Co-culture studies showed that BCR-ABL+ cells induced apoptosis in BCR-ABL negative cells. Antisense 24p3/siRNA expression reduced the level of 24p3 protein in both BCR-ABL+ cells and in conditioned medium (CM) obtained from these cells. CM from BCR-ABL+ cells expressing antisense 24p3/siRNA had reduced apoptotic activity for target cells; 24p3 antibody also reduced the apoptotic activity of the CM. Leukemic mice induced by BCR-ABL+ cells expressing either antisense 24p3 or 24p3 siRNA had increased levels of normal hematopoiesis and reduced invasion of leukemia cells in marrow and spleen tissues. These findings indicate that suppression of normal hematopoiesis in BCR-ABL-induced leukemia is an active process involving secretion of the cell death-inducing factor 24p3 by mouse leukemia cells, raising the possibility that similar factors are involved in BCR-ABL+ CML."

https://openalex.org/W2132144858,"We have used cultured human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) and breast tumor-derived lines to gain information on defects that occur during breast cancer progression. HMEC immortalized by a variety of agents (the chemical carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene, oncogenes c-myc and ZNF217, and/or dominant negative p53 genetic suppressor element GSE22) displayed marked upregulation (10-15 fold) of the telomere-binding protein, TRF2. Upregulation of TRF2 protein was apparently due to differences in post-transcriptional regulation, as mRNA levels remained comparable in finite lifespan and immortal HMEC. TRF2 protein was not upregulated by the oncogenic agents alone in the absence of immortalization, nor by expression of exogenously introduced hTERT genes. We found TRF2 levels to be at least twofold higher than in control cells in 11/15 breast tumor cell lines, suggesting that elevated TRF2 levels are a frequent occurrence during the transformation of breast tumor cells in vivo. The dispersed distribution of TRF2 throughout the nuclei in some immortalized and tumor-derived cells indicated that not all the TRF2 was associated with telomeres in these cells. The process responsible for accumulation of TRF2 in immortalized HMEC and breast tumor-derived cell lines may promote tumorigenesis by contributing to the cells' ability to maintain an indefinite lifespan."
https://openalex.org/W2120646353,"Tumor cell invasion is a highly integrated and complex process comprising several biologically distinct functions such as cell adhesion, motility, proteolysis, etc. Visinin-like protein-1 (VILIP-1), a member of the neuronal EF-hand calcium-sensor protein family, plays a role in regulating tumor cell invasiveness of mouse squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). VILIP-1 enhances cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels through PKA induction. However, the mechanism by which VILIP-1 reduces cell invasiveness is not well understood. In this study, we show that VILIP-1 decreased cell adhesion and migration/invasiveness of highly invasive mouse SCC cells. Forced expression of VILIP-1 reduced cell adhesion to fibronectin in parallel to downregulating αv and α5 integrin subunit levels. VILIP-1 overexpression also led to decreased migration ability. Conversely, short hairpin RNA-mediated VILIP-1 knock-down of SCC cells' characterized by little or no invasiveness, correlated with increased adhesion to fibronectin and enhanced expression of αv and α5 integrin subunits together with increased cell migration. Function-blocking assays with inhibitory anti-α5 and anti-αv integrin antibodies showed that both subunits contributed to cell adhesion, migration, and invasiveness of highly invasive SCC cell lines. These results point to a critical role of VILIP-1 in regulating cell adhesion and migration by downregulation of fibronectin receptor expression. Decreased or absent VILIP-1 expression in SCC cell subpopulations may lead to a more advanced malignant phenotype characterized by changes in adhesive ability and increased cell motility, suggestive of a tumor suppressor function."
https://openalex.org/W2023592256,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a minimally invasive treatment for cancer and several noncancerous proliferating cell diseases. PDT relies on the uptake of a photosensitizing compound by the pathologic tissue followed by a selective irradiation with visible light, which leads to oxidative stress-mediated cell death. However, some studies showed that PDT induces the release of proangiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, and/or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), thereby promoting cancer cell regrowth following PDT. In this work, we focused on the molecular mechanisms regulating COX-2 expression after low-dose PDT in two cancer cell lines, namely HeLa and T24. We report that PDT induces COX-2 expression in these cells and this expression is mainly due to nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)-dependent transcription of cox-2 gene without any post-transcriptional regulation. However, the transduction mechanism leading to NF-κB activation and subsequent cox-2 gene transcription differs in both cell types. In T24, NF-κB activation occurs through a protein kinase C (PKC)α- and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent I kappa B kinase (IKK) complex activation, whereas in HeLa cells, NF-κB activation is mediated by PKC- and PI3K-independent IKK complex activation."

https://openalex.org/W2085870808,"The tumor suppressor Rb (retinoblastoma protein) is known to regulate p53-dependent apoptosis, but the mechanisms involved are unclear. In a rat fibroblast model, we previously observed that caspase inhibition potentiates p53-dependent apoptosis and prevents the Rb cleavage associated with p53 activation. These results suggested that a caspase(s) can antagonize p53-mediated apoptosis via the production of a protective Rb truncated form. Here, we identify caspase-9 as the caspase that interferes, upstream of the mitochondrion, with p53-induced apoptosis in both immortalized and primary fibroblasts. This caspase can be detected as a p38 processed form in living cells, in the absence of apoptosome formation and apoptotic signal. We also provide evidence that the involvement of caspase-9 in a pre-mitochondrial protective pathway results from the previously undescribed cleavage of Rb, at a LExD site, into a p76Rb form, which antagonizes p53-induced apoptosis. These results establish that a truncated form of Rb can display an antiapoptotic activity, rather than just being a by-product of Rb degradation."

Little is known about the role of Mayven in cancer. Here, we report that Mayven expression was abundant and diffuse in primary human epithelial breast tumor cells as compared to normal breast epithelial cells, where Mayven was detected in the normal breast layer of the mammary ducts. Overexpression of Mayven resulted in an induction of c-Jun protein levels, as well as increased AP-1 (activating protein 1) transcriptional activity in MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells through its BTB/POZ domain. Furthermore, Mayven activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase in breast cancer cells. Mayven, through its BTB/POZ domain, induced cyclin D1 expression and cyclin D1 promoter activity and promoted cell cycle progression from the G1 to S phase. MCF-7 cells transduced with the recombinant retroviral sense Mayven (pMIG-W-Mayven) showed significant induction of c-Jun and cyclin D1 mRNA expression and activities as compared to the retroviral vector alone, while MCF-7 cells transduced by the recombinant retroviral antisense Mayven (pMIG-W-Mayven-AS) demonstrated a significant decrease in c-Jun and cyclin D1 expression and activities. Given the crucial functions of cyclin D1 and AP-1 signaling in oncogenesis, our results strongly suggest that overexpression of Mayven may promote tumor growth through c-Jun and cyclin D1."

https://openalex.org/W2022440282,"Transformation of chick embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) by the v-Jun oncoprotein correlates with a downregulation of the alpha 2 (I) collagen gene. To investigate whether this gene constitutes a direct target of v-Jun, an analysis of a large proximal fragment of the promoter, extending from position −1080 to +109, was performed. Transient transfections with −1080/+109 and deleted derivatives revealed that a short proximal fragment, −433/+11, is the target for repression by v-Jun. Extensive analysis, conducted in CEFs and in Sp1/3-deficient Drosophila SL2 cells, further showed that (i) high constitutive activity of −433/+11 requires a direct binding of the ubiquitous Sp1 and/or Sp3 transcription factors acting on two distinct motifs, that is, a proximal TCC-rich region and an upstream GC box, and that (ii) repression by v-Jun does not require any direct binding of the oncoprotein to the DNA, but an indirect binding within a v-Jun–Sp1/3–DNA chromatin-associated complex. This situation is reminiscent of a situation previously reported with the tata-less, SPARC (secreted protein, acidic, and rich in cysteine) target promoter that regulates the expression of another extracellular matrix component in the same model of cell transformation. Taken together, these data reinforce the view that, at least in CEFs, v-Jun downregulates a family of direct target genes by binding to the DNA indirectly through Sp1/3."
