The nine known FGF ligands and the four signaling FGF receptors (and their alternatively spliced variants) are expressed in specific spatial and temporal patterns. The activity of this signaling pathway is regulated by ligand binding specificity, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and the differential signaling capacity of individual FGF receptors. To determine potentially relevant ligand-receptor pairs we have engineered mitogenically responsive cell lines expressing the major splice variants of all the known FGF receptors. We have assayed the mitogenic activity of the nine known FGF ligands on these cell lines. These studies demonstrate that FGF 1 is the only FGF that can activate all FGF receptor splice variants. Using FGF 1 as an internal standard we have determined the relative activity of all the other members of the FGF family. These data should serve as a biochemical foundation for determining developmental, physiological, and pathophysiological processes that involve FGF signaling pathways.

INTRODUCTIONFibroblast growth factor (FGF) 1The abbreviations used are: FGFfibroblast growth factorFGFRfibroblast growth factor receptor. was identified as an activity that stimulates the proliferation of NIH3T3 cells (1Gospodarowicz D. Moran J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 66: 451-457Google Scholar). Currently, FGFs comprise a family of nine structurally related proteins (FGF 1–9). FGFs are expressed in specific spatial and temporal patterns and are involved in developmental processes, angiogenesis, wound healing, and tumorigenesis (2Folkman J. Klagsbrun M.

A. 1992; 89: 3305-3309Google Scholar), and alternative mRNA splicing leads to isoforms of these receptors which have unique ligand binding properties (15Werner S. Duan D.-S.R. de Vries C. Peters K.G. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 82-88Google Scholar, 17Miki T. Bottaro D.P. Fleming T.P. Smith C.L. Burgess W.H. Chan A.M.-L. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

An additional mechanism regulating FGF activity involves heparin or heparan sulfate proteoglycans, molecules which facilitate ligand-receptor interactions (12Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Google Scholar, 19Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Google Scholar, 20Pantoliano M.W. Horlick R.A. Springer B.A. Van Dyk D.E. Tobery T. Wetmore D.R. Lear J.D. Nahapetian A.T. Bradley J.D. Sisk W.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10229-10248Google Scholar). FGFRs contain an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular domain determines ligand binding specificity and mediates ligand-induced receptor dimerization. Dimerization in turn results in one or more trans-phosphorylation events and the subsequent activation of the receptor (21Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Google Scholar).The extracellular region of the FGFR contains three immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains (6Lee P.L. Johnson D.E. Cousens L.S. Fried V.A. Williams L.T. Science. 1989; 245: 57-60Google Scholar). Alternative mRNA splicing creates several forms of the FGF receptor which differ in their extracellular sequence and have unique ligand binding properties. One splicing event results in the skipping of exons encoding the amino-terminal Ig-like domain (domain I) resulting in a “short” two Ig-like domain form of the receptor (22Johnson D.E. Lu J. Chen H. Werner S. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4627-4634Google Scholar). The ligand binding properties of the short (two Ig-like domain) and long (three Ig-like domain) FGFRs are similar. 2D. M. Ornitz, M. Goldfarb, and A. Chellaiah, unpublished data. However, the short form of the receptor may have a higher affinity for some FGFs than the long form (23Wang F. Kan M. Yan G. Xu J. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10231-10235Google Scholar). Changes in this alternative splicing pattern may correlate with the progression of several tumors toward malignancy (24Yamaguchi F. Saya H. Bruner J.M. Morrison R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 484-488Google Scholar, 25Kobrin M.S. Yamanaka Y. Friess H. Lopez M.E. Korc M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4741-4744Google Scholar).Another RNA splicing event utilizes one of two unique exons and results in three alternative versions of Ig-like domain III (referred to as domains IIIa, IIIb, IIIc) in FGFRs 1–3 (15Werner S. Duan D.-S.R. de Vries C. Peters K.G. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 82-88Google Scholar, 18Chellaiah A.T. McEwen D.G. Werner S. Xu J. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol.

FGFRs containing alternatively spliced Ig-like domains IIIb (“b”) and IIIc (“c”) are expressed on the cell surface and bind FGF ligands. The IIIa (“a”) splice form of the FGFR terminates within Ig-like domain III to yield a secreted extracellular FGF-binding protein with no known signaling capability (26Duan D.-S.R. Werner S. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16076-16080Google Scholar). DNA encompassing the carboxyl-terminal half of Ig-like domain III in FGFRs 1, 2, and 3 have a remarkable conservation in both the number and arrangement of the intron/exon boundaries (18Chellaiah A.T. McEwen D.G. Werner S. Xu J. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11620-11627Google Scholar, 27Champion-Arnaud P. Ronsin C. Gilbert E. Gesnel M.C. Houssaint E. Breathnach R.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 249-252Google Scholar). Expression of these receptor isoforms appears to be regulated in a tissue-specific manner with b exon expression restricted to epithelial lineages and c exon expression restricted to mesenchymal lineages (29Avivi A. Yayon A. Givol D. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 249-252Google Scholar, 30Orr-Urtreger A. Bedford M.T. Burakova T. Arman E. Zimmer Y. Yayon A. Givol D. Lonai P. Dev.

Biol. 1993; 13: 5461-5468Google Scholar). Unlike FGFRs 1–3, FGFR 4 is not alternatively spliced in this region (34Vainikka S. Partanen J. Bellosta P. Coulier F. Basilico C. Jaye M. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4273-4280Google Scholar).Receptor binding specificity is an essential mechanism for regulating FGF activity. Specificity is determined by sequence differences among individual FGFRs, by alternative splicing, and by sequence differences among the nine FGF ligands. Knowledge of the paired interactions between the nine known FGFs and the major splice forms of the four known FGF receptors is essential to begin to discern the functions of FGFs during development. In this report we analyze the mitogenic activity of each FGF on BaF3 cell lines that express unique FGFRs. For the known FGFs, we have assembled the available published mitogenic activity data for BaF3 cells (35Mathieu M. Chatelain E. Ornitz D. Bresnick J. Mason I. Kiefer P. Dickson C. J. Biol.

A. 1990; 87: 1596-1600Google Scholar) on the b and c splice forms of the FGFRs 1–3 and on FGFR 4.DISCUSSIONFGFs compose a family of growth factors that play key roles in a variety of developmental events. Many of the FGFs are expressed only in embryonic tissues. However, some of the FGFs continue to be expressed in adult tissues and may be important for maintaining normal tissue homeostasis. FGFs are also involved in mediating a physiological response to injury (3Klagsbrun M. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1989; 1: 207-235Google Scholar). Diffusion of FGFs from their site of synthesis is limited by their affinity for cell surface and extracellular matrix heparan sulfate (56Flaumenhaft R. Moscatelli D. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1651-1659Google Scholar). Therefore, the tissue-specific expression of FGFs and FGF receptors are critical factors that regulate the activation of the FGF receptor signaling pathway.Ectopic expression of an FGF ligand or aberrant splicing of an FGF receptor can result in the activation of an autocrine signaling pathway and ensuing uncontrolled cell proliferation. Consistent with this, several of the FGFs are oncogenic when aberrantly expressed in humans or mice (57Delli Bovi P. Curatola A.M. Kern F. Greco A. Ittmann M. Basilico C. Cell. 1987; 50: 729-738Google Scholar, 58Dickson C. Smith R. Brookes S. Peters G. Cell. 1984; 37: 529-536Google Scholar, 59Zhan X. Bates B. Hu X. Goldfarb M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3487-3495Google Scholar). Additionally, switching in expression from FGFR 2b to FGFR 2c has been implicated in the progression of prostate cancer from a non-malignant, stromal-dependent, epithelial tumor to an invasive, stromal-independent, undifferentiated tumor (32Yan G. Fukabori Y. McBride G. Nikolaropolous S. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4513-4522Google Scholar). This splice form change alters the ligand binding profile of FGFR 2 for both FGF 2 and FGF 7. Coincident with the change in receptor expression, up-regulation of alternative ligands such as FGF 2 has been observed within these epithelial cells (32Yan G. Fukabori Y. McBride G. Nikolaropolous S. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4513-4522Google Scholar).All seven FGFR-expressing BaF3 cell lines respond to FGF 1. This observation is consistent with previously published data (7Dionne C.A. Crumley G. Bellot F. Kaplow J.M. Searfoss G. Ruta M. Burgess W.H. Jaye M. Schlessinger J.

A. 1991; 88: 7625-7629Google Scholar). FGF 1 thus appears to be a universal FGFR ligand and may functionally define a core FGF-binding domain. FGF 1 was therefore used as a positive control and to normalize the mitogenic activity of the other FGFs. Notably, no other FGF ligand could activate all FGFRs.The expression patterns of FGF receptors 1, 2, and 3 are distinct and analysis of the alternative splicing pattern of these receptors demonstrates that the utilization of either the b or c exon is dependent upon cell lineage. The b exon appears to be expressed in epithelial tissues while the c exon is expressed in mesenchymal tissues (29Avivi A. Yayon A. Givol D. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 249-252Google Scholar, 32Yan G.

Biol. 1993; 13: 5461-5468Google Scholar). The activity of several of the FGFs toward FGFR isoforms can be divided along these lines. FGF 3 activates the b splice forms of FGFRs 1 and 2, and FGF 7 activates the b splice form of FGFR 2. Expression studies demonstrate that FGF 3 and FGF 7 are expressed in mesenchymal tissues and thus may be paracrine effectors of the overlying epithelia (60Wilkinson D.G. Peters G. Dickson C. McMahon A.P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 691-695Google Scholar, 61Wilkinson D.G. Bhatt S. McMahon A.P. Development. 1989; 105: 131-136Google Scholar, 62Finch P.W. Rubin J.S. Miki T. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1989; 245: 752-755Google Scholar). In contrast, FGFs 4, 5, 6, and 8 specifically activate c receptor splice forms. Expression studies localize FGF 8 to epithelial tissues and thus FGF 8 may be a paracrine inducer of underlying mesenchyme (36MacArthur C.A. Lawshé A. Xu J. Santos-Ocampo S. Heikinheimo M. Chellaiah A.T. Ornitz D.M. Development. 1995; 121: 3603-3613Google Scholar, 63Heikinheimo M. Lawshé A. Shackleford G.M. Wilson D.B. MacArthur C.A. Mech. Dev. 1994; 48: 129-138Google Scholar, 64Crossley P.H. Martin G.R. Development. 1995; 121: 439-451Google Scholar). FGFs 4, 5, and 6 are expressed in both epithelial and mesenchymal lineages and may therefore have either autocrine or paracrine roles (65deLapeyriere O. Ollendorff V. Planche J. Ott M.O. Pizette S. Coulier F. Birnbaum D. Development. 1993; 118: 601-611Google Scholar, 66Hébert J.M. Boyle M. Martin G.R. Development. 1991; 112: 407-415Google Scholar, 67Drucker B.J. Goldfarb M. Mech. Dev. 1993; 40: 155-163Google Scholar, 68Niswander L. Martin G.R. Development. 1992; 114: 755-768Google Scholar). FGFs 2 and 9 preferentially activate c splice forms; however, FGF 2 shows some activity toward FGFR 1b, and FGF 9 shows some activity toward FGFR 3b. Like FGFs 4, 5, and 6, these FGFs may have both autocrine and paracrine roles.The diversity in the binding specificity of FGF receptors for FGFs clearly can lead to a large combinatorial set of possible interactions. In addition to the interactions shown in Table III, heterodimers may form between FGF ligands and between FGF receptors. Heterodimers may further increase the repertoire of interactions between FGFs and FGF receptors. Furthermore, the interactions of FGF ligands with heparan sulfate proteoglycans may further affect specificity toward FGF receptors. The concentration of heparin chosen for these studies was such that the activity of FGFs that are known to require relatively high heparin concentrations is optimal. Also, at this concentration, heparin is unlikely to have significant inhibitory activity toward an FGF since the maximum mitogenic activity of individual FGFs is comparable to that of FGF 1 on one or more of the receptor-specific cell lines. With these caveats in mind, this study is nevertheless the first attempt to compare the receptor-specificity of all the FGFs under identical experimental conditions. The important next step will be to determine which ligand-receptor pairs are important in development, in tissue homeostasis and in disease.

An additional mechanism regulating FGF activity involves heparin or heparan sulfate proteoglycans, molecules which facilitate ligand-receptor interactions (12Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P.

FGFRs contain an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular domain determines ligand binding specificity and mediates ligand-induced receptor dimerization. Dimerization in turn results in one or more trans-phosphorylation events and the subsequent activation of the receptor (21Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Google Scholar).The extracellular region of the FGFR contains three immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains (6Lee P.L. Johnson D.E. Cousens L.S. Fried V.A. Williams L.T. Science. 1989; 245: 57-60Google Scholar). Alternative mRNA splicing creates several forms of the FGF receptor which differ in their extracellular sequence and have unique ligand binding properties. One splicing event results in the skipping of exons encoding the amino-terminal Ig-like domain (domain I) resulting in a “short” two Ig-like domain form of the receptor (22Johnson D.E. Lu J. Chen H. Werner S. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4627-4634Google Scholar). The ligand binding properties of the short (two Ig-like domain) and long (three Ig-like domain) FGFRs are similar. 2D. M. Ornitz, M. Goldfarb, and A. Chellaiah, unpublished data. However, the short form of the receptor may have a higher affinity for some FGFs than the long form (23Wang F. Kan M. Yan G. Xu J. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10231-10235Google Scholar). Changes in this alternative splicing pattern may correlate with the progression of several tumors toward malignancy (24Yamaguchi F. Saya H. Bruner J.M. Morrison R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 484-488Google Scholar, 25Kobrin M.S. Yamanaka Y. Friess H. Lopez M.E. Korc M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4741-4744Google Scholar).Another RNA splicing event utilizes one of two unique exons and results in three alternative versions of Ig-like domain III (referred to as domains IIIa, IIIb, IIIc) in FGFRs 1–3 (15Werner S. Duan D.-S.R. de Vries C. Peters K.G. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 82-88Google Scholar, 18Chellaiah A.T. McEwen D.G. Werner S. Xu J. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol.

FGFRs containing alternatively spliced Ig-like domains IIIb (“b”) and IIIc (“c”) are expressed on the cell surface and bind FGF ligands. The IIIa (“a”) splice form of the FGFR terminates within Ig-like domain III to yield a secreted extracellular FGF-binding protein with no known signaling capability (26Duan D.-S.R. Werner S. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16076-16080Google Scholar). DNA encompassing the carboxyl-terminal half of Ig-like domain III in FGFRs 1, 2, and 3 have a remarkable conservation in both the number and arrangement of the intron/exon boundaries (18Chellaiah A.T.

Expression of these receptor isoforms appears to be regulated in a tissue-specific manner with b exon expression restricted to epithelial lineages and c exon expression restricted to mesenchymal lineages (29Avivi A.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4273-4280Google Scholar).Receptor binding specificity is an essential mechanism for regulating FGF activity. Specificity is determined by sequence differences among individual FGFRs, by alternative splicing, and by sequence differences among the nine FGF ligands. Knowledge of the paired interactions between the nine known FGFs and the major splice forms of the four known FGF receptors is essential to begin to discern the functions of FGFs during development. In this report we analyze the mitogenic activity of each FGF on BaF3 cell lines that express unique FGFRs. For the known FGFs, we have assembled the available published mitogenic activity data for BaF3 cells (35Mathieu M. Chatelain E. Ornitz D. Bresnick J. Mason I. Kiefer P. Dickson C. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1974248631,"Caveolae are microdomains of the plasma membrane that have been implicated in signal transduction. Caveolin, a 21–24-kDa integral membrane protein, is a principal component of the caveolae membrane. Recently, we and others have identified a family of caveolin-related proteins; caveolin has been retermed caveolin-1. Caveolin-3 is most closely related to caveolin-1, but caveolin-3 mRNA is expressed only in muscle tissue types. Here, we examine (i) the expression of caveolin-3 protein in muscle tissue types and (ii) its localization within skeletal muscle fibers by immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation. For this purpose, we generated a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb) probe that recognizes the unique N-terminal region of caveolin-3, but not other members of the caveolin gene family. A survey of tissues and muscle cell types by Western blot analysis reveals that the caveolin-3 protein is selectively expressed only in heart and skeletal muscle tissues, cardiac myocytes, and smooth muscle cells. Immunolocalization of caveolin-3 in skeletal muscle fibers demonstrates that caveolin-3 is localized to the sarcolemma (muscle cell plasma membrane) and coincides with the distribution of another muscle-specific plasma membrane marker protein, dystrophin. In addition, caveolin-3 protein expression is dramatically induced during the differentiation of C2C12 skeletal myoblasts in culture. Using differentiated C2C12 skeletal myoblasts as a model system, we observe that caveolin-3 co-fractionates with cytoplasmic signaling molecules (G-proteins and Src-like kinases) and members of the dystrophin complex (dystrophin, α-sarcoglycan, and β-dystroglycan), but is clearly separated from the bulk of cellular proteins. Caveolin-3 co-immunoprecipitates with antibodies directed against dystrophin, suggesting that they are physically associated as a discrete complex. These results are consistent with previous immunoelectron microscopic studies demonstrating that dystrophin is localized to plasma membrane caveolae in smooth muscle cells."

Here, we have studied the effects of various mediators on the expression of the PAR-2 and the thrombin receptor in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Stimulation with the cytokines tumor necrosis factor α or interleukin-1 α as well as bacterial lipopolysaccharide elevated the expression of PAR-2 in a dose-dependent manner. The time course of induction after cytokine stimulation was similar to those published for the adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. After 20 h of stimulation, PAR-2 mRNA and protein levels were increased to 5–10-fold basal values, and, in the continued presence of tumor necrosis factor α, PAR-2 mRNA expression was found to remain elevated for up to 4 days. In contrast, the thrombin receptor gene was not induced by any of these inflammatory mediators. The responses to phorbol ester treatment also differed between the two genes. Thrombin receptor mRNA levels decreased steadily up to 20 h, whereas PAR-2 mRNA levels first rose to about 3-fold basal values at 4 h before decreasing again. Cell surface protein levels of both receptors were decreased after 20 h of phorbol ester stimulation. Elevating intracellular cAMP levels by treatment with forskolin resulted in decreased expression of both receptors, and inhibition of cAMP degradation appeared to blunt the cytokine-induced increase in PAR-2 expression.

Furthermore, α-hordothionin caused permeabilization of fungal hyphae to the non-metabolite α-aminoisobutyric acid and, in addition, altered the electrical properties of artificial lipid bilayers, consistently leading to rupture of the lipid bilayers. The plant defensins did not form ion-permeable pores in artificial membranes and did not exhibit substantial hyphal membrane permeabilization activity.

Now, using Northern hybridization and RNase protection assay, we provide evidence that the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) gene, which encodes a human GS-X pump, is expressed at higher levels in cisplatin-resistant (HL-60/R-CP) cells than in sensitive cells, whereas amplification of the MRP gene is not detected by Southern hybridization. Culturing HL-60/R-CP cells in cisplatin-free medium resulted in reduced MRP mRNA levels, but these levels could be induced to rise within 30 h by cisplatin and heavy metals such as arsenite, cadmium, and zinc. The increased levels of MRP mRNA were closely related with enhanced activities of ATP-dependent transport of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) in plasma membrane vesicles.

https://openalex.org/W1542447612,"The oncogene product Bcl-2 effectively spares cells from programmed cell death (apoptosis). The molecular mechanism underlying this death-protective activity has, however, remained enigmatic. Here we show that induction of Bcl-2 expression is consistently associated with a retardation of mammalian cell proliferation due to a prolongation of the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Whereas cells lacking Bcl-2 expression die from any point of the cell cycle in response to apoptotic agents, Bcl-2-overexpressing cells accumulate in the G0/G1 phase and are protected from cell death. Co-expression of Bax, a negative regulator of Bcl-2, reverts both the cell death protective and proliferation retarding activities of Bcl-2. Moreover, a Bcl-2 mutant defective in death protection does not affect cell division. These findings indicate that Bcl-2 contributes to cell survival by diminishing the rate of cell proliferation.

Programmed cell death (apoptosis) exhibits a series of morphological features in common with mitosis. These include cell rounding, surface blebbing, nuclear lamina disassembly, and chromatin condensation (1Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6586) Google Scholar, 2Ucker D.S. Obermiller P.S. Eckhart W. Apgar J.F. Berger N.A. Meyers J. Mol. Cell.

In addition, a variety of gene products involved in the transition from quiescence to proliferation (immediate early genes) are activated during apoptosis (4Sen S. D'Incalci M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 5Colombel M. Olsson C.A. Ng P.-Y. Buttyan R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4313-4319PubMed Google Scholar). Fundamental differences have, however, been noted between mitosis and apoptosis. For a proper proceeding of mitosis, cell cycle components such as cyclins, protein kinases, and phosphatases have to be activated and inactivated in limited amounts at specific time points (6King R.W. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 563-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), and cells can pass to the next phase of the cell cycle only when the previous one has been successfully completed (checkpoint controls) (7Murray A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 872-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). By contrast, during apoptosis, cell cycle components are frequently activated prematurely, leading to an abortive cell cycle that fails to enter S phase (8Scott D.W. Livnat D. Pennell C. Keng P. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 9Warner G.L. Ludlow J.W. Nelson D.A. Gaur A. Scott D.W. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 175-181PubMed Google Scholar) or to perturb G2 or M phases (10Ishigami T. Kim K.-M. Horiguchi Y. Higaki Y. Hata D. Heike T. Katamura K. Mayumi M. Mikawa H. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 360-368PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, DNA damage is mostly left unrepaired due to an improper functioning of the repair machinery and/or the activation of specific endonucleases that cleave DNA into large (50-300-kilobase) or small (200-base pair) fragments (11Oberhammer F. Wilson J.W. Dive C. Morris I.D. Hickman J.A. Wakeling A.E. Walker P.R. Sikorska M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, 12Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4089) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that cycling cells often encounter a crossroads of apoptosis and mitosis where the decision for the subsequent fate is made. If anti-apoptotic survival factors act at this point, cells are rescued from apoptosis (13Harrington E.A. Bennett M.R. Fanidi A. Evan G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). This can be due to a direct inhibition of positive regulators of apoptosis such as proteases and endonucleases, as has been shown for the survival factors cowpox virus serpin cytokine response modifier A (crmA) (14Ray C.A. Black R.A. Kronheim S.R. Greenstreet T.A. Sleath P.R. Salvesen G.S. Pickup D.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 597-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar) or the baculovirus p35 (15Xue D. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1995; 377: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Alternatively, survival factors may actively interfere with cell proliferation in order to diminish the chance of a cell to encounter the crossroads of mitosis and apoptosis. The oncogene product Bcl-2 effectively saves cells from apoptosis (16Reed J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2342) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of its death-sparing activity has been proposed to be an antioxidant function (17Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.-M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3230) Google Scholar). However, the findings that Bcl-2 still protects cells from apoptosis under anaerobic conditions (18Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kosaka H. Kamiike W. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1995; 374: 811-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 19Jacobson M.D. Raff M. Nature. 1995; 374: 813-816Crossref Scopus (628) Google Scholar) suggest yet other molecular functions of Bcl-2. Here we test a possible anti-proliferative function of Bcl-2 and find that overexpression of Bcl-2 indeed markedly retards cell division of several mammalian cell lines under nonstressed and apoptotically stressed conditions. This effect is specific since co-expression of the Bcl-2 antagonist Bax mitigates both the anti-proliferative and anti-apoptotic activities of Bcl-2, and a survival-deficient Bcl-2 mutant has no effect on cell division. Vector control and Bcl-2-overexpressing rat 6 (R6) embryo fibroblasts, murine L929 fibroblasts, and murine PB3c mast cells were generated by retroviral transduction of the pMV12hygro vector lacking or containing the murine Bcl-2 cDNA as described previously (20Borner C. Martinou I. Mattmann C. Irmler M. Schaerer E. Martinou J.-C. Tschopp J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 expression is constitutively driven by the retroviral long terminal repeats. Following hygromycin selection, single clones were picked, expanded, and analyzed for Bcl-2 expression by immunoblotting of total cellular protein using a polyclonal anti-murine Bcl-2 antiserum (20Borner C. Martinou I. Mattmann C. Irmler M. Schaerer E. Martinou J.-C. Tschopp J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Low and high Bcl-2-expressing R6 (low, R6-Bcl-2#5; high, R6-Bcl-2#9) and L929 cell clones (L929-Bcl-2#5) as well as vector control counterparts (R6-pMV12#5, L929-pMV12#5) were chosen for cell proliferation analysis. For PB3c cells, a hygromycin-resistant mixed population was analyzed instead (PB3c-pMV12mix, PB3c-Bcl-2mix). Vector control and Bcl-2-overexpressing human JILY B lymphoblasts and U937 monocytes were generated by transfection of the Epstein Barr virus-based, episomal expression vector pMEP (Invitrogen) lacking or containing the murine Bcl-2 cDNA. Bcl-2 expression is driven by a zinc-inducible metallothionein promoter. Following transfection, cells were selected in 400 µg/ml hygromycin. Mixed populations (uncloned) of resistant cells were established (JILY-pMEPmix, JILY-Bcl-2mix, U937-pMEPmix, U937-wtBcl-2mix) and analyzed for Bcl-2 expression as described above. The U937 cells co-expressing Bax and Bcl-2 (U937-Bax/wtBcl-2mix) were generated as follows: 5 × 105 U937-wtBcl-2mix cells were transfected with the expression plasmid pCB6neo (21Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) containing the human Bax cDNA. A mixed population of G418-resistant transfectants was established and probed for the expression of Bax by immunoblotting using a polyclonal anti-human Bax antiserum provided by J. C. Reed (22Krajewski S. Blomqvist C. Franssila K. Krajewska M. Wasenius V.-M. Niskanen E. Nordling S. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4471-4478PubMed Google Scholar). U937-Bax/wtBcl-2 cells were re-examined for Bcl-2 expression by immunoblotting and revealed similar basal and zinc-induced Bcl-2 levels as U937-wtBcl-2mix cells. Anti-Bcl-2 and anti-Bax immunoblots were performed with extracts from cells treated with or without zinc for 24 h. R6 embryo fibroblasts co-overexpressing Bcl-2 and Bax were created by transfecting the pCB6neo plasmid containing the mouse Bax cDNA into the Bcl-2-overexpressing R6-Bcl-2#9 cell line (20Borner C. Martinou I. Mattmann C. Irmler M. Schaerer E. Martinou J.-C. Tschopp J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). G418 (for Bax)- and hygromycin (for Bcl-2)-resistant clones were expanded into cell lines and analyzed for Bcl-2 and Bax expression by immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-mouse Bcl-2 (20Borner C. Martinou I. Mattmann C. Irmler M. Schaerer E. Martinou J.-C. Tschopp J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and anti-mouse Bax antibodies (23Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Shabaik A. Miyashita T. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1323-1336PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. The clone R6-Bax/Bcl-2#1 was selected because it expressed approximately equal amounts of Bcl-2 and Bax (data not shown). Cells were seeded at a density of 0.5-1 × 105 cells per 35-mm plate (diameter) in 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum (without hygromycin). They were counted on triplicate plates with media changes every 2nd day. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Extraction of total protein and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (20Borner C. Martinou I. Mattmann C. Irmler M. Schaerer E. Martinou J.-C. Tschopp J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The mutant Bcl-2 (G142E) was created by site-directed mutagenesis using the Transformer™ kit of Clontech according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The mutagenic primer was GGGGTGAACTGGGAGAGGATTGTGGCC which changed glycine to glutamic acid at position 142 of murine Bcl-2. This point mutation lies within the conserved BH1 region of the Bcl-2 family members and has previously been shown to mitigate the survival activity of Bcl-2 (24Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). The mutant Bcl-2 cDNA was subcloned into pMEP and transfected into U937 cells creating U937-mutBcl-2mix cells as described above. For flow cytometry, subconfluent cells were untreated or treated with 100 nM staurosporine for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were harvested, permeabilized, stained with 20 µM propidium iodide for 15 min, and analyzed by flow cytometry as described (25Darzynkiewicz Z. Li X. Gong J. Hara S. Traganos F. Cell Growth and Apoptosis: a Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1995: 143Google Scholar). Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. For the induction of DNA synthesis by thymidine incorporation, serum-starved subconfluent R6pMV12#5 and R6-Bcl-2#9 cells were either stimulated or not with 10% fetal calf serum, and, 12-24 h later, [3H]thymidine incorporation into the DNA of these cells was determined exactly as described (26Hoshina S. Ueffing M. Weinstein I.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 145: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We initially observed that slowly proliferating subclones of the rat 6 embryo fibroblast (R6) cell line were more resistant to cell death (apoptosis) than rapidly proliferating subclones of the same cell line (data not shown). To substantiate this inverse correlation between cell proliferation and cell survival, we introduced into five different mammalian cell lines the mouse counterpart of the survival factor Bcl-2. Cloned cell lines and mixed cell populations which stably overexpressed Bcl-2 (Fig. 1, insets) all grew slower than their vector control counterparts as measured by cell counting (Fig. 1). A direct correlation between the degree of proliferation and the level of Bcl-2 overexpression was difficult to assess because the endogenous expression of factors which impede Bcl-2 function were unknown. The most dramatic step down of cell proliferation following Bcl-2 overexpression was seen in transformed cell lines (L929 fibroblastoid, JILY lymphoblastoid, or U937 monocytic lymphoma) (Fig. 1B). In these cells, only low to moderate expression levels of Bcl-2 could be achieved following Bcl-2 cDNA transfer (Fig. 1B) suggesting that the clonal outgrowth of transformed cells is impeded by Bcl-2 overexpression. To test whether diminished cell proliferation is a direct consequence of Bcl-2 expression, we created U937 cells in which Bcl-2 expression was inducible. For that purpose we used the expression vector pMEP which contains a zinc-inducible metallothionein promoter. When U937 cells transfected with the vector alone were treated with 100 µM ZnSO4, the rate of proliferation was the same as with untreated cells (compare Figs. 1B and 2A, control + zinc). U937 cells carrying the pMEP vector with the wild-type murine Bcl-2 cDNA were slightly compromised in cell division due to a basal expression level of Bcl-2 (Fig. 2A, wtBcl-2). This impediment on cell proliferation was strongly accentuated when the latter cells were exposed to 100 µM ZnSO4 to further induce Bcl-2 expression (Fig. 2A, wtBcl-2 + zinc). Importantly, induced expression of the inactive Bcl-2 mutant G142E (24Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar) did not cause retardation of U937 cell proliferation (Fig. 2A, mutBcl-2 + zinc). Bax is a Bcl-2 homolog that mitigates the survival activity of Bcl-2, presumably through heterodimerization with Bcl-2 (27Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5687) Google Scholar). We therefore generated cell lines which constitutively overexpressed Bax to investigate whether this would revert the inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 on cell proliferation. Parental, vector control, and Bcl-2-overexpressing U937 cells all displayed low endogenous expression levels of Bax (Fig. 2B, inset). Transfection of human Bax into U937-Bcl-2mix cells yielded a mixed population of hygromycin- and G418-resistant cells (U937-Bax/wtBcl-2mix) which constitutively overexpressed Bax (Fig. 2B, inset) and could still be induced by zinc to express high levels of Bcl-2 (data not shown). In the presence of 100 µM ZnSO4, the U937-Bax/wtBcl-2mix cells grew at a rate similar to vector control cells, indicating that Bax had reverted the inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 on cell proliferation (Fig. 2B, Bax/wtBcl-2 + zinc). This is most likely due to a neutralization of the Bcl-2 activity by heterodimerization with Bax since overexpression of Bax alone did not accelerate U937 cell proliferation (data not shown). If Bax neutralized the negative impact of Bcl-2 on cell proliferation, it should also allow the cloning of transformed cells with high Bcl-2 expression levels. Indeed, Bcl-2 cDNA transfection into Bax-overexpressing L929 cells now yielded hygromycin-resistant clones which expressed Bcl-2 at 4-10 times higher levels than in the absence of Bax overexpression (data not shown). Next we wanted to know whether the impact of Bcl-2 on the retardation of cell proliferation is linked to its survival activity. For that purpose, we concomitantly monitored the survival capacity and the cell cycle state of cells which had been treated with the apoptotic agent staurosporine. Similar results were obtained when cells were exposed to other apoptotic substances such as brefeldin A, okadaic acid or tumor necrosis factor α. As evidenced by thymidine incorporation unstressed, Bcl-2-overexpressing R6 cells (R6-Bcl-2#9) exhibited a longer G1 phase of the cell cycle than vector control cells (R6-pMV12#5) (Fig. 3C). This was confirmed by flow cytometry of the DNA content of asynchronous cell populations (Fig. 3A). Whereas vector control cells randomly distributed throughout the cell cycle with 58% in G1 phase, 24% in S phase, and 18% in G2/M phase, Bcl-2-overexpressing cells displayed a higher accumulation in the G1 phase (70%) with lower mitotic figures (18%). This G1 prolongation effect was not seen with either the overexpression of the inactive Bcl-2 mutant G142E (data not shown) or the co-overexpression of Bcl-2 and Bax (R6-Bax/Bcl-2#1) (60% G1, 22% S, 18% G2/M) (Fig. 3A). Treatment of R6-pMV12#5 with 100 nM staurosporine led to a drastic decrease in cell survival within the first 24 h (Fig. 3D). Flow cytometry after 24 h revealed a high percentage of cells with less than 2n DNA indicating that nuclear/cellular fragmentation into apoptotic bodies had occurred (Fig. 3B) (25Darzynkiewicz Z. Li X. Gong J. Hara S. Traganos F. Cell Growth and Apoptosis: a Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1995: 143Google Scholar). A significant amount of cells still had DNA contents corresponding to the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 3B). This result is consistent with previous reports that stressed cells do not necessarily pass through G0/G1 before they undergo apoptosis but die in any phase of the cell cycle (13Harrington E.A. Bennett M.R. Fanidi A. Evan G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 28Lindenboim L. Diamond R. Rothenberg E. Stein R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1242-1247PubMed Google Scholar). However, R6 cells overexpressing Bcl-2 did not display DNA fragmentation and were spared from staurosporine-induced cell death for the first 24 h (Fig. 3D). These cells exclusively accumulated in the G0/G1 phase during cell death protection (Fig. 3B). Again, Bax co-expression mitigated the effect of a G0/G1 accumulation in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3B), and cells died in a way similar to vector control cells (Fig. 3D). Thus, cells appear to survive better if the G0/G1 phase is prolonged and Bcl-2 actively contributes to achieve this condition. Indeed, arresting R6-pMV12#5 cells in G0/G1 phase by thymidine block or isoleucine starvation partially rescued the cells from staurosporine-induced apoptosis (data not shown) as had been reported previously for other cell death systems (29Belizario J.E. Dinarello C.A. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2379-2385PubMed Google Scholar, 30Meikrantz W. Gisselbrecht S. Tam S.W. Schlegel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3754-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Cell death protection by cell cycle blockers has, however, never been as efficient as if Bcl-2 was overexpressed indicating that Bcl-2 controls yet other molecular mechanisms than the cell cycle to save cells from apoptosis. Our findings support the concept that the susceptibility of a cell to apoptosis is influenced by its proliferative state (29Belizario J.E. Dinarello C.A. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2379-2385PubMed Google Scholar, 30Meikrantz W. Gisselbrecht S. Tam S.W. Schlegel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Apoptosis is associated with the activation of growth-related immediate early gene products (c-Fos, c-Myc, c-Jun, etc.) (4Sen S. D'Incalci M.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5922-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), cell death appears to be caused by driving the cells from a quiescent G0 state into the cell cycle, which they are then unable to complete (abortive mitosis). Conversely, arresting cells early in G1 offers protection from apoptosis (29Belizario J.E. Dinarello C.A. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2379-2385PubMed Google Scholar, 30Meikrantz W. Gisselbrecht S. Tam S.W. Schlegel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3754-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). This is best illustrated by the retinoblastoma gene product (41Haas-Kogan D.A. Kogan S.C. Levi D. Dazin P. T'Ang A. Fung Y.-K.T. Israel M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and the Abl tyrosine kinase (34Evans C.A. Owen-Lynch P.J.

Cell. 1994; 77: 121-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), both of which keep cells in G0/G1 and act as potent cell survival factors. Here we add the survival factor Bcl-2 to the list of proteins which can prolong the G0/G1 phase. Indeed, it has previously been seen that colon cancer cells overexpressing Bcl-2 are inhibited in their proliferation (43Pietenpol J.A. Papadopoulos N. Markowitz S. Willson K.V. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3714-3717PubMed Google Scholar), and that IL-3 removal from Bcl-2-overexpressing BAF3 cells irreversibly arrests the cells in G1 phase (44Marvel J. Perkins G.R. Lopez-Rivas A. Collins M.K. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1117-1122PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that the retardation in cell proliferation is a direct consequence of Bcl-2 overexpression and inhibitable by its negative regulator Bax. How Bcl-2 performs this action is unknown. Due to its nuclear membrane localization (45Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar), Bcl-2 may interfere with the nuclear transport of critical S phase progression factors as has been shown for Cdc2 and Cdk2 (30Meikrantz W. Gisselbrecht S. Tam S.W. Schlegel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3754-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Bcl-2 could impede the Ca2+ signaling required for both apoptosis and proliferation since Bcl-2-overexpressing cells were found to display diminished Ca2+ fluxes across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (46Lam M. Dubyak G. Chen L. Nunez G. Miesfeld R.L. Distelhorst C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6569-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). By whatever mechanism, by slowing down cell division Bcl-2 may diminish the chance of a cell to encounter a crossroads of mitosis and apoptosis or to allow cells to better deal with the repair of protein, lipid, and DNA which are damaged during apoptotic stresses. The present results also provide an explanation why hematopoietic tumors such as non-Hodgkin follicular lymphomas and B-CLL which overexpress Bcl-2 are typically of low-grade nature and contain a high portion of cells in a resting or prolonged G1 state (47Poppema S. Kaleta J. Hugh J. Visser L. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 126: 163-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Perhaps Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in promoting the survival of slowly proliferating tumors.

Concentrations of 8-epi-PGF2α in the range 1 nM to 1 µM induce a dose-dependent increase in platelet shape change, in calcium release from intracellular stores [Ca2+]i and in inositol phosphates; it also causes irreversible platelet aggregation, dependent on thromboxane generation, when incubated with subthreshold concentrations of ADP, thrombin, collagen, and arachidonic acid. Much higher concentrations of 8-epi-PGF2α (10–20 µM) alone induce weak, reversible aggregation.Although these effects are prevented by pharmacological thromboxane receptor antagonists, they are unlikely to be mediated by thromboxane receptors. Thus, 8-epi-PGF2α does not compete for binding at the stably expressed placental or endothelial isoforms of the thromboxane receptor or for binding of thromboxane ligands to human platelets. Furthermore, the response to 8-epi PGF2α exhibits structural specificity versus 8-epi PGF3α and PGF2α. Concentrations in the range that evoke its effects on platelets do not desensitize the aggregation response stimulated by thromboxane or PGH2 analogs. Unlike primary prostaglandins, which are rapidly metabolized to inactive products, 8-epi PGF2α circulates in plasma. However, the systemic concentrations found in healthy volunteers (median 48 pmol/liter) and in patients with hepatic cirrhosis (median 147 pmol/liter), a syndrome of oxidant stress in vivo, fall well below those which modulate platelet function.8-Epi PGF2α may amplify the response to platelet agonists in syndromes where oxidant stress and platelet activation coincide. Despite blockade by thromboxane antagonists, 8-epi PGF2α does not activate either of the thromboxane receptor isoforms described in platelets. Activation of a distinct receptor would be consistent with the enzymatic formation of 8-epi PGF2α by cyclooxygenases. However, incidental activation of such a receptor by systemic concentrations of 8-epi PGF2α is unlikely to occur, even in syndromes of excessive free radical generation in vivo. 8-epi-Prostaglandin (PG) F2α may be formed by cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 or by a free radical catalyzed process as an isoprostane.

Similar effects have been ascribed to 8-epi PGE2 (14Longmire A.W. Roberts L.J. Morrow J.D. Prostaglandins. 1994; 48: 247-256Google Scholar). prostaglandin cyclooxygenase enzyme platelet-rich plasma washed platelets placental thromboxane receptor endothelial thromboxane receptor human embryonic kidney cells thromboxane Hanks' balanced salt solution. We have recently developed a stable isotope dilution assay for 8-epi PGF2α, using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (15Delanty N. Reilly M. Praticò D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). We have demonstrated the potential utility of measuring this compound in human urine as an index of oxidant stress in vivo (16Reilly M. Delanty N. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Circulation. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar, 17Delanty N. Reilly M. Lawson J.A. McCarthy J. Fitzgerald D.J. FitzGerald G.A. Circulation. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have found that 8-epi PGF2α, unlike other F2 isoprostanes, can be formed in a free radical or cyclooxygenase (COX)-dependent manner. It is a minor product of the COX-1 enzyme in human platelets (18Praticò D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9800-9808Google Scholar) and a somewhat more abundant product of COX-2 in human monocytes (19Praticò D. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8919-8924Google Scholar). Despite these observations, enzymatic pathways account for a trivial component of overall formation of 8-epi PGF2αin vivo, even in syndromes of COX activation (16Reilly M. Delanty N. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Circulation. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar, 20Wang Z. Ciabattoni G. Creminon C. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Patrono C. Maclouf J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 94-100Google Scholar). However, such a mechanism of formation might be consistent with a local autacoidal or systemic hormonal function, mediated via distinct receptors. The present study was designed to address the hypothesis that 8-epi PGF2α might exert biological effects at the concentrations which circulate in vivo. We decided to explore its effects on platelets in particular, as reports of its effects on this cell type have been conflicting. The platelet, which possesses the ability to form the compound enzymatically, might be a likely target for a receptor mediated activation in vivo, either in the local microenvironment or in the systemic circulation. Finally, we wished to determine if 8-epi PGF2α was likely to exert its effects on platelets and, by implication, on other cells, via a newly described (21Raychowdhury M.K. Yukawa M. Collins L.J.

Coller, Mt. Sinai Hospital, New York. Venous blood was collected from the antecubital veins of nonsmoking, healthy volunteers who had abstained from medications for at least 2 weeks prior to the study. Blood was collected into plastic syringes containing 3.8% sodium citrate as anticoagulant (ratio 9:1). Platelet aggregation was examined in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and in washed platelets (WP) by light transmission at 37°C, as described previously (18Praticò D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9800-9808Google Scholar). Briefly, citrated whole blood was centrifuged at 160 × g for 10 min, and the PRP was removed. Platelet-poor plasma was prepared by spinning the remaining blood at 900 × g for 10 min. WP were prepared from PRP after centrifugation and resuspended in calcium and magnesium-free HBSS at pH 7.4. Unless otherwise stated, platelet number was always adjusted at 3 × 108 platelet/ml with platelet-poor plasma or HBSS. Platelet aggregation was performed in 500-µl aliquots (Biodata PAP-4, Biodata Corp., Hatboro, PA) using threshold concentration of agonists. Threshold is defined as the lowest concentration that evokes irreversible aggregation, with an amplitude between 65 and 85% of the potential maximum deflection in light transmission (22Praticò D. Iuliano L. Pulcinelli F.M. Gazzaniga P.P. Bonavita M.S. Violi F. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1992; 119: 364-370Google Scholar). Platelet aggregation was also studied using subthreshold concentrations of agonists. Subthreshold concentrations are defined as the highest dose that induces less than a 10% increase in light transmission (22Praticò D. Iuliano L. Pulcinelli F.M. Gazzaniga P.P. Bonavita M.S. Violi F. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1992; 119: 364-370Google Scholar). Blood anticoagulated with 5 mM EDTA and containing indomethacin (5 µg/ml) was centrifuged at 160 × g for 10 min. The PRP was removed. The platelets were desensitized by incubation for 30 min with U46619 (1 µM), I-BOP (100 nM), or 8-epi PGF2α (1 µM). The presence of EDTA prevents activation during the incubation with the desensitizing agonist. The desensitized platelets were then washed twice by centrifugation and resuspended in HBSS buffer. Platelet TxA2 production was assessed, 3 min after the stimulus, as its hydrolysis product TxB2, using a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry assay, as described previously (23Reilly I. FitzGerald G.A. Blood. 1987; 69: 180-186Google Scholar). Platelet shape change was determined in 500-µl aliquots of PRP by light transmission. Platelet aggregation was prevented by prior addition of 7E3 10 µg/ml, a Fab(2′) fragment of an antibody to the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (24Coller B.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 101-108Google Scholar). Agonists and antagonists were added in volume of 5% or less to avoid dilution artifacts. The signal was amplified and recorded as the maximum reduction in light transmission within 2 min of adding the agonist, as described previously (10Takahara K. Murray R. FitzGerald G.A. Fitzgerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6836-6844Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cells were plated in 100-mm culture dishes 24 h prior to transfection at a density of 1.5 × 106 cell/dish. The cDNAs encoding the placental (TPα) (25Hirata M. Hayashi Y. Ushikubi F. Yokota Y. Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Narumiya S. Nature. 1991; 349: 617-620Google Scholar) or endothelial (TPβ) human thromboxane receptor isoforms were subcloned into the EcoRI-EcoRI or the EcoRI-XbaI site, respectively, of the G418-resistant mammalian expression vector pcDNAIII (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Cells were transfected by cationic liposome mediated transfer (DOTAP, Boehringer Mannheim) with 10 µg of DNA/dish, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 6 h after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing G418 (1 mg/ml). Cell lines were grown from single colonies which were apparent after approximately 10 days in culture. Receptor expression was verified in several cells lines by Northern analysis using the respective cDNAs as probes. The TPβ cDNA was a generous gift of Dr. Anthony Ware (21Raychowdhury M.K. Yukawa M. Collins L.J. McGrail S.H. Kent K.C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19256-19261Google Scholar). HEK cells stably expressing the TPα or TPβ cDNAs were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (without calcium and magnesium), harvested in HED buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µM indomethacin), and lysed by sonication. Membranes were prepared by centrifugation (130,000 × g) for 1 h at 4°C. The pellets were resuspended in HEDG buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µM indomethacin, 10% glycerol, 100 mM NaCl) and were stored at −80°C. Receptors (25–50 µg of membrane protein/reaction) were radiolabeled with 0.5 nM125I-BOP (∼350 cpm/fmol; ∼16,000 cpm/tube) for 30 min at 30°C in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of competing ligand (26Dorn II, G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4240-4246Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 4 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% BSA) and immediate filtration through G/FC filters (Whatman International Ltd., Maidstone, UK) which had been soaked in ice-cold wash buffer and radioactivity associated with the filters was counted using a scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments). Blood was anticoagulated with EDTA 5 mM and indomethacin (5 µg/ml). PRP was prepared as described above. The platelets were resuspended in Tris buffer, pH 7.4 (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM dextrose). 3H-SQ29,548 (0.5 nM) (27Ogletree M.L. Harris D.V. Greenberg R. Haslanger M.F. Nakane M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1985; 234: 435-441Google Scholar) was incubated with platelets in the presence of varying concentrations of unlabeled I-BOP, U46619, 8-epi PGF2α, and PGF2α to assess competitive displacement of the agonist ligand. Platelets were incubated with excess of unlabeled SQ29,548 (10 µM) to determine the nonspecific binding. Incubations were performed as described above. Washed platelets were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (Tris-HCl 20 mM, EDTA 5 mM, indomethacin 1 mg/ml, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to prepare platelet membranes. They were resuspended again in hypotonic buffer and allowed to stand for 20 min on ice. Following sonication, they were centrifuged at 130,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C and resuspended in buffer (Tris-HCl 20 mM, MgCl2 10 mM, EDTA 5 mM) pH 7.4. The protein concentration was determined by using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay system (Bio-Rad). One hundred micrograms of the membrane protein were then incubated with various concentrations of I-BOP, U46619, 8-epi PGF2α, PGF2α, and SQ29,548 as described above. To address the possibility that 8-epi PGF2α stimulation of human platelets might involve a phospholipase coupled with a toxin-sensitive G protein, WP were incubated with saponin (15 µg/ml) and pertussis toxin (15 µg/ml) for 5 min at 37°C, then different stimuli added, as described previously (28Watson S.P. Ruggiero M. Abrahams S.L. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5368-5372Google Scholar). PRP was incubated with 2 µM Fura-2/AM at 37°C for 45 min, washed in order to remove the extracellular Fura-2, and resuspended in HBSS, pH 7.4. Fluorescence measurement was carried out at 37°C in a Perkin-Elmer LS 50-B spectrofluorimeter equipped with magnetic stirrer (Perkin-Elmer, Buckinghamshire, UK). The fluorescence signal was monitored at 510 nm with the excitation wavelength of 340 and 380 nm. The ratios of maximum and minimum fluorescence were determined by the addition of 250 µM digitonin in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2 and in the presence of 10 mM EGTA (pH >8.5), respectively, as described previously (22Praticò D. Iuliano L. Pulcinelli F.M. Gazzaniga P.P. Bonavita M.S. Violi F. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1992; 119: 364-370Google Scholar). Platelets were labeled with myo-[3H]inositol and the formed inositol phosphates were extracted from the cells by chloroform/methanol/HCl and separated by Dowex-1 anion exchange chromatography, as described previously (29Lapetina E.G. Siess W. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 141: 176-192Google Scholar). Briefly, WP were incubated with myo-[2-3H]inositol (50 µCi/ml) at 37°C for 3 h, then washed and resuspended in HBSS, pH 7.4, containing 10 mM LiCl. These conditions inhibit conversion of inositol phosphates to free inositol. The platelets were then incubated for 10 min at 37°C, prior to their stimulation by agonists. Total inositol phosphates were separated on a Dowex 1-X8 AG anion exchange resin (formate form). Following elution of [3H]inositol and [3H]glycerophosphorylinositol with 60 mM ammonium formate containing 5 mM disodium tetraborate, total inositol phosphates were eluted with 12 ml of 1 M ammonium formate containing 100 mM formic acid. An aliquot (2 ml) of the elution was taken, 8 ml of scintillation liquid were added, and the radioactivity was determined by using a scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments). Plasma levels of 8-epi PGF2α were assayed as described previously (18Praticò D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9800-9808Google Scholar) using a stable isotope dilution assay by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Blood anticoagulated with EDTA and immediately centrifuged to separate the plasma, was obtained from 10 healthy volunteers (30–55 years of age; six were men), and from eight patients with hepatic cirrhosis (40–60 years of age, five men). In all patients the diagnosis of cirrhosis was confirmed by histology. Their clinical characteristics are defined elsewhere (30Praticò D. Basili S. Cordova C. Iuliano L. Ferro D. Camastra C. FitzGerald G.A. Violi F. J. Invest. Med. 1996; 44: 301AGoogle Scholar). Data were subjected to analysis of variance prior to pairwise comparisons as appropriate. A nonparametric approach was employed to avoid assumptions as to the distribution of the parameters under study. The data are presented as the mean ± the standard error of the mean (S.E.). Initially, we examined the effect of 8-epi PGF2α on platelet shape change at various concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 10 µM. 8-Epi PGF2α induced a dose-dependent platelet shape change with an EC50 of 0.6 ± 0.2 µM (Fig. 1). SQ29,548 (1 µM) completely inhibited the shape change induced by 8-epi PGF2α, in contrast to aspirin (100 µM) or indomethacin (10 µM), which did not modify the response. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin (15 µg/ml) also failed to prevent 8-epi PGF2α induced shape change (data not shown). A structural isomer of 8-epi PGF2α, 8-epi PGF3α, did not evoke platelet shape change at concentrations up to 50 µM (data not shown). The effects of 8-epi PGF2α and that of the PGH2 analog, U46619, on the shape change were additive (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Platelet shape change induced by U46619 and 8-epi PGF2α. Human platelets pretreated with 7E3 (10 µg/ml) to prevent aggregation were stimulated with U46619 (0.4 µM) alone or in combination with increasing concentrations of 8-epi PGF2α. Each point represents the mean ± S.E. of four different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) 8-Epi PGF2α alone failed to induce irreversible aggregation or a rise in platelet TxB2 at concentrations up to 100 µM. Weak, reversible aggregation was evoked by concentrations in excess of 20 µM (Fig. 3A). Because 8-epi PGF2α seemed to act as weak platelet agonist, we decided to investigate if it could modulate the platelet response to more common agonists. No significant effect on the maximal aggregation response to threshold concentrations of ADP (2 µM), thrombin (1 unit/ml), U46619 (1 µM), collagen (2 µg/ml), or arachidonic acid (100 µM) was observed when 8-epi PGF2α was coincubated with these ligands. However, the lag phase of the response to collagen was shortened (Fig. 3B). We noted that, when 8-epi PGF2α was combined with arachidonic acid or collagen, there was a significant increase of TxB2 production above that seen when these agonists were used alone (Table I).Table I.Platelet aggregation and TxB2 production by human platelets stimulated with threshold concentrations of agonists with without 8-epi PGF2αConditionsa8-Epi PGF2α (1 µM) was always added 15 s after arachidonic acid (100 µM) or collagen (2 µg/ml).

Open table in a new tab To address further the possibility that 8-epi PGF2α might amplify the platelet response to conventional agonists, we explored its effects on the response to subthreshold concentrations of these compounds which are insufficient to induce full aggregation when used alone. 8-Epi PGF2α dose-dependently increased the magnitude of the platelet aggregation response when combined with the subthreshold concentrations of the agonists. The EC50 values for ADP, arachidonic acid, U46619, and collagen were, under these conditions, 0.8, 0.2, 0.6, and 0.5 µM, respectively (Table II). Furthermore, platelet TxB2 production was commensurately increased when 8-epi PGF2α was combined with subthreshold concentrations of the agonists (data not shown). Both effects were prevented by aspirin or SQ29,548 (data not shown).Table II.Effect of increasing concentrations of 8-epi PGF2α on platelet aggregation induced by subthreshold concentration of platelet agonistsConditionsa8-Epi PGF2α was always added 15 s after the agonists.

Open table in a new tab The thromboxane analog, I-BOP, dose-dependently displaced 125I-BOP from the TPα and TPβ isoforms which were stably expressed in HEK 293 cells. 8-Epi PGF2α, in contrast, failed to displace the agonist ligand from either isoform (Fig. 4). I-BOP and U46619 both competed with SQ29,548 on WP membranes with an IC50 values of 10 nM (n = 4) and 100 nM (n = 4), respectively. 8-Epi PGF2α, by contrast, was much (IC50 = 100 µM) less effective than I-BOP or U46619 at displacing 3H-SQ29,548 from its binding sites. PGF2α was an even less effective competitor for the binding sites identified by I-BOP than was 8-epi PGF2α (Fig. 5A). Similar results were obtained in platelet membranes. I-BOP and U46619 both exhibited high affinity for the binding site identified by SQ29,548 with IC50 values of 10 nM (n = 4) and 100 nM (n = 4) respectively. Competition binding studies with 8-epi PGF2α at concentrations up to 100 µM failed to displace 3H-SQ29,548 completely (Fig. 5B). To address further the possibility that 8-epi PGF2α activates receptors distinct from these activated by PGH2 or thromboxane A2, we studied its ability to desensitize the platelet response to these ligands. Concentrations of 8-epi PGF2α in the range (EC50 100 nM to 1 µM) which evokes platelet shape change, failed to desensitize the shape change response to either U46619 or I-BOP (Fig. 6A). Very high concentrations of 8-epi PGF2α (50 µM) caused a small decrease in the shape change response to U46619 (not shown). Preincubation of platelets with similar concentrations of 8-epi PGF2α failed to modulate the aggregation responses to either U46619 or I-BOP (Fig. 6B). Each of these two ligands induced homologous desensitization of their own shape change and aggregation responses. Human platelets loaded with Fura-2/AM and stimulated with 8-epi PGF2α respond with a rapid, transient, increase in intracellular calcium, which coincides with platelet shape change. The EC50 for this response was 3.1 ± 1.0 µM (Fig. 7). To investigate whether the increase in calcium induced in platelets by 8-epi PGF2α was of extracellular or intracellular origin, Fura-loaded human platelets were pretreated with 1 mM CaCl2 to increase a potential influx of extracellular calcium. Similarly, they were pretreated with 2 mM EGTA to chelate extracellular calcium. No change in the 8-epi PGF2α evoked calcium signal were observed upon treatment with either 1 mM CaCl2 or EGTA in comparison with untreated platelets. This result implies that 8-epi PGF2α induces mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores. This mobilization of intracellular calcium evoked by 8-epi PGF2α was unaffected by pretreatment with the relatively nonspecific (COX-1 versus COX-2) (31Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. DeWitt D.L. Hla T. Funk C.D. Smith W.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 927-934Google Scholar) COX inhibitors, indomethacin (10 µM), or aspirin (100 µM). The thromboxane receptor antagonist SQ29,548 (1 µM) was able to prevent it completely (data not shown)"
https://openalex.org/W2031640084,"Light dependence and kinetics of reversible phosphorylation of the D1 reaction center protein of Photosystem II was studied in pumpkin leaves. At growth light, maximal phosphorylation of D1 was observed after illumination of 1 h, with higher phosphorylation rates at stronger irradiances. 70–85% of D1 became phosphorylated, corresponding to the proportion of the protein in appressed thylakoid membranes. Comparison of the kinetics of D1 phosphorylation and photoinactivation of Photosystem II revealed that D1 phosphorylation became saturated before any significant photoinhibition of Photosystem II could be detected. Dephosphorylation of D1 in both dim light and darkness was determined in leaves preilluminated with high light for various periods. Similar rates of D1 dephosphorylation were observed after short preillumination conditions that induce no significant loss of functional Photosystem II centers. In contrast, photodamage to Photosystem II centers significantly decreased the dephosphorylation rate of D1 in darkness, and no dephosphorylation occurred in leaves containing mainly damaged Photosystem II centers. Darkness also blocked the degradation of damaged D1 after photoinhibitory preillumination. Degradation of damaged D1 could be prevented even in dim light by sodium fluoride, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases, indicating that dephosphorylation is a prerequisite for D1 proteolysis. We conclude that in higher plants (i) high light induced photodamage to Photosystem II occurs in the centers containing phosphorylated D1. (ii) Dephosphorylation of phosphorylated and photodamaged D1 is associated with the repair cycle of inactivated Photosystem II and is a light-dependent reaction in vivo. (iii) Dephosphorylation of D1 in functional Photosystem II centers, however, occurs rapidly and independent of light. We suggest that two reversible phosphorylation cycles with spatially segregated protein phosphatases are involved in dephosphorylation of functional and damaged phosphorylated D1, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1965490540,"Histone acetylation is maintained through the action of histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases and has been correlated with increased gene activity. To investigate the functional role of these enzymes in the regulation of transcription, we have purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae two histone deacetylase activities, HDA and HDB, with molecular masses of ∼350 and 600 kDa, respectively. In vitro, the HDA activity deacetylates all four core histones, has a preference for histone H3, and is strongly inhibited by trichostatin A (a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylases). HDB is considerably less sensitive to trichostatin A. We report the extensive purification of the HDA activity and the identification of peptides (p75, p73, p72, and p71) whose presence correlates with deacetylase activity on native polyacrylamide gels. An antibody to p75 immunoprecipitates peptides with molecular masses similar to those in the 350-kDa complex. Additionally, antibodies to p75 and p71 specifically precipitate histone deacetylase activity and co-immunoprecipitate each other. Gene disruptions of p75 (HDA1) or p71 (HDA3) cause the loss of the 350-kDa (but not the 600-kDa) activity from our chromatography profiles. These data argue strongly that HDA1 and HDA3 are subunits of the HDA complex, which is structurally distinct from the second, HDB complex. Histone acetylation is maintained through the action of histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases and has been correlated with increased gene activity.

https://openalex.org/W1982977272,"Abstract A fluorescent vinblastine derivative, vinblastine-4′-anthranilate, has been shown to inhibit polymerization of rat brain tubulin (IC50 = 4.8 μM). Binding of the drug to tubulin increases fluorescence intensity, causes a small emission blue shift, and has a quantum yield of 0.037. Fluorescence increases as a function of drug concentration, with a high affinity site and an undetermined number of lower affinity sites. Photolabeling, by exciting the fluorescent drug-tubulin complex at the absorption maximum of anthranilate, yields a covalent adduct confined to β-tubulin. Its formation is specific in that it is blocked by maytansine or vinblastine. Tryptic hydrolysis identifies a single fluorescent β-peptide coinciding with residues 175–213. The interactions between various ligands at this central portion of β-tubulin are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2067415612,"We and others have shown that Cbl, the protein product of the c-cbl proto-oncogene, is an early target of tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation through the immune cell surface receptors, which signal through noncovalently associated cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. Using human mammary epithelial cells that express a natural epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and require EGF as an essential growth factor, we demonstrate here that Cbl is a prominent target of tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation through the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Phosphorylation of Cbl was EGF dose-dependent, rapid (detectable as early as 5 s and maximal by 2 min), and relatively sustained (detectable even after 1 h). Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that Cbl became associated with the EGF receptor in an EGF-dependent manner. Cbl was basally associated with the adaptor protein growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 (Grb2), and this interaction was further enhanced by EGF stimulation; however, the interaction was entirely mediated via the Grb2 Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, suggesting that binding of Grb2 SH2 domain to EGF receptor provides one mechanism of Cbl's association with the EGF receptor. EGF stimulation also induced the association of Cbl with Src homology and collagen (Shc) protein, p85 subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Crk proteins, in particular with the CrkL isoform. Interactions of Cbl with the EGF receptor and multiple downstream signaling proteins suggest a role for this proto-oncogene product in mitogenic signaling through growth factor receptor kinases."

The combination of subunits and splice variants determines the pharmacological and physiological properties of the receptor. In the present study we investigated the relationship between NR1 splice variants and NR2 subunits in rat brain using a series of antibodies selective for the four NR1 cassettes, which vary in the NR1 splice variants, and for NR2A and NR2B. Sodium deoxycholate at pH 9.0 solubilized about 35% of the receptor, which was intact based on co-immunoprecipitation of NR1 and NR2 subunits and chemical cross-linking of the solubilized receptor. The cross-linked product contained three high molecular weight components, Mr = 603,000, 700,000, and 750,000, which were immunolabeled with antibodies to NR1 and to NR2 subunits. Immunoprecipitation analyses using antibodies selective for NR2A and NR2B showed no preferential assembly between NR2 subunits and NR1 splice variants. There was little co-immunoprecipitation of NR2A and NR2B, suggesting that most NMDA receptor complexes contain only one of these subunits. However, receptor complexes can contain at least two different NR1 splice variants. In developing conditions for the solubilization of intact NMDA receptor complexes, we observed a differential solubilization of NR1 and NR2 subunits. NR2 was nearly insoluble in Triton X-100 in both microsomal and synaptic membrane fractions, while NR1 was readily soluble in the microsomal fraction but insoluble in the synaptic membrane fraction. These results suggest that the NR1 subunit is modified when it is incorporated into the synaptic membrane, possibly by strengthening its interaction with NR2 or another synaptic protein.

While the NR1 subunit is functional in expression systems in a homomeric form, the NR2 subunits are not and require the NR1 subunit to form a functional complex (2Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev.

However, the mechanisms regulating the assembly of the NMDA receptor complex are not well characterized, and it is not known if multiple NR1 and NR2 subunits are present in each complex and whether or not different splice variants or NR2 subunits can be present in the same complex.

Recent studies have indicated that NR1 splice variants may differ in their abilities to form clusters and in their interactions with the postsynaptic density (PSD) protein PSD-95. Only variants containing the C1 cassette formed receptor-rich aggregates on the plasma membrane when expressed in cultured fibroblasts; splice variants lacking this domain were distributed throughout the cytoplasm (35Ehlers M.D. Tingley W.G. Huganir R.L. Science. 1995; 269: 1734-1737Google Scholar). All NR2 subunits contain an amino acid sequence at their C termini that is the target of interaction with PSD-95, while only NR1 variants with the C2′ cassette contain the sequence for anchoring to PSD-95 (36Kornau H.-C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Google Scholar). With immunoprecipitation with antibodies selective for the N1 and C1 cassettes, Sheng et al. (37Sheng M. Cummings J. Roldman L.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 368: 144-147Google Scholar) suggested that certain splice variants may be selectively associated with different NR2 subunits. Together, these findings suggest NMDA receptor complexes may be selectively targeted to, and stabilized at, postsynaptic locations based on particular splice variants of NR1 present in the complex, and that the NR2 subunits present in the complex may be related to the NR1 splice variants. Multiple NMDA receptor complexes, with different splice variant and subunit compositions, may be present in a neuron with only some destined for synaptic expression. Such an interpretation would be consistent with the relatively large intracellular pool of receptor seen for most subtypes of glutamate receptors, including NMDA receptors (28Petralia R.S.

The objective of the present work was to study the biochemical properties of the NMDA receptors and to characterize the relationship between NR1 splice variants and the NR2 subunits in brain. We developed antibodies selective for the four cassettes of NR1, which are present or absent in the eight splice variants, and antibodies selective for the NR2 subunits, NR2A and NR2B. Conditions for the optimal detergent solubilization of intact NMDA receptor complexes were determined to allow immunoprecipitation analyses of NR1 splice variants and NR2 subunits. Synthetic peptides with amino acid sequences corresponding to the specific areas of the NMDA receptor subunits (Table I) were produced commercially (Peptide Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). Conjugation of the peptides to bovine serum albumin with glutaraldehyde and production and purification of the antibodies were performed as described previously (42Wenthold R.J. Yokotani N. Doi K.

The homogenate was subfractionated by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15 min and the supernatant S1 removed and further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. Synaptic membranes were obtained as described (46Gurd J.W. Jones L.R. Mahler H.R. Moore W.J. J. Neurochem. 1973; 22: 281-290Google Scholar). The P2 pellet was resuspended in hypotonic buffer B (0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mM AEBSF, 10 µM EDTA, 10 µM leupeptin, 1 µM pepstatin) and incubated for 30 min on ice, briefly sonicated, and 2 M sucrose was added to make a final concentration of 1.3 M. The lysate was overlaid with a layers of 0.8 M sucrose and 0.32 M sucrose and centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 20 min. Synaptic membranes were recovered from the 1.3 M and 0.8 M sucrose interface and stored at −70°C. Subfractionation of the S2 supernatant to obtain microsomal fractions was performed as described (46Gurd J.W. Jones L.R. Mahler H.R. Moore W.J. J. Neurochem. 1973; 22: 281-290Google Scholar). The S2 fraction was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant recovered and centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 120 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended at 0.32 M sucrose and layered over a discontinuous sucrose gradient (0.8, 1.0, 1.3, and 2.0 M sucrose) and centrifuged at 97,000 × g for 120 min. The interfaces between 1.0 M and 0.8 M, and 0.8 M and 0.32 M sucrose layers were used. Synaptic membranes were resuspended in buffer B (pH 7.5 or 9.0 as indicated) at protein concentrations of 4–6 mg/ml, and detergents were added to final concentrations as indicated. The RIPA buffer composition was: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (DOC), 0.1% SDS (37Sheng M. Cummings J. Roldman L.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 368: 144-147Google Scholar). The solubilization was carried out at 4°C or at 37°C for 60 min, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4°C. Affinity-purified antibody (20 µg) was attached to 50 µl of Protein A-agarose beads (Pierce) by incubating in 0.5 ml of buffer B containing 0.1% Triton X-100 overnight, followed by washing three times with the same buffer. The detergent-soluble portion of synaptic membranes was dialyzed against buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100 overnight. When solubilized with DOC, the pH was adjusted to pH 8.0, and Triton X-100 was added to the soluble portion to a final concentration of 0.1% prior to the dialysis. The dialyzed solution was centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and 1 ml of the supernatant mixed with Protein A-agarose bead-antibody complex and mixed for 5 h at 4°C. The beads were washed three times with buffer B containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and then were boiled in 100 µl of SDS-PAGE dissolving solution (2-fold concentration) for 15 min. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (47Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) using gels 8 cm in length with 4–12% acrylamide gradients. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described (48Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). Membranes were treated with 3% nonfat instant powdered milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST: 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween 20). Membranes were washed with TBST and treated with 0.5-1 µg/ml primary antibody in TBST. The incubation was carried out at room temperature for 2 h. The secondary antibody was either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Amersham Corp.) or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated (Promega). The protein levels detected with enhanced chemiluminescence were quantitatively analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. Protein fractions for cross-linking were prepared at a final protein concentration of 4–6 mg/ml in buffer in which HEPES was substituted for Tris. Dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP; Pierce) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 100 mg/ml and added to final concentrations of 0, 50, and 250 µM; cross-linking was done at room temperature for 30 min with vigorous shaking. The reaction was stopped by adding Tris to a final concentration of 0.1 M or by adding directly equal amounts of 2 × SDS-PAGE dissolving solution without reducing agents. To disrupt the cross-linked proteins, dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to the SDS-PAGE dissolving solution at a final concentration 0.2 M. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 15 min followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 20°C. Supernatants were recovered and electrophoresis was carried out as described, except that the running time was prolonged until the prestained phosphorylase b (105,000 Da) reached the bottom of the gel. The molecular mass standards, ferritin (450,000 Da), thyroglobulin (670,000 Da), and human IgM (950,000 Da), were detected with Coomassie Blue stain. Antibodies to NR1 splice variants were raised against peptides corresponding to either the entire sequence or parts of the four cassettes, N1, C1, C2, and C2′ (Table I). The specificity of the antibodies was tested using immunoblots of membranes of cells transfected with NR1 splice variants NR1-1a, which contains cassettes C1 and C2, and NR1-4b, which contains cassettes N1 and C2′. As seen in Fig. 1, the antibodies are selective for their respective splice variant, and also do not recognize NR2A or 2B. The NR1 pan antibody recognizes both NR1-1a and NR1-4b. All antibodies recognize a corresponding band in hippocampus; in many cases (for example, NR1 pan), a broad immunoreactive band is seen in which multiple minor bands can be discerned and probably represent different splice variants. Antibodies to NR2A and NR2B, made to peptides corresponding to sequences near their C termini (Table I), are selective for their respective subunit, while the antibody to NR2A/B recognizes both subunits as previously reported (39Petralia R.S. Wang Y.-X. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6102-6120Google Scholar). The doublet seen in membranes of NR2B-transfected cells, as detected with both NR2B-selective antibodies and NR2A/B antibodies, is consistent with the presence of both glycosylated and deglycosylated forms of the subunit, as reported previously (28Petralia R.S. Yokotani N. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 667-696Google Scholar). Some antibodies do recognize additional bands as seen in immunoblots of the hippocampus. These appear to be unrelated proteins that share the epitopes recognized by the antibodies in the NMDA receptors, since no pattern of staining of these bands is apparent when two or more antibodies to the same subunit are used. All antibodies, except those selective for NR2A and NR2B and NR1 C1, were effective in immunoprecipitating the detergent-solubilized receptor from rat brain, as well as detecting the receptor on Western blots. The optimal conditions for solubilization of the NMDA receptor complex from synaptic membranes was determined using various combinations of detergents, ionic conditions, and pH. Unlike conditions for solubilization of AMPA and kainate receptors (42Wenthold R.J. Yokotani N. Doi K. Wada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 501-507Google Scholar, 43Wenthold R.J. Trumpy V.A. Zhu W.-S. Petralia R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1332-1339Google Scholar), Triton X-100 was not effective in solubilizing NMDA receptors (Fig. 2). Increasing ionic strength with 1 M NaCl increased NR1 solubilization, but had little effect on NR2. Including DTT slightly increased the solubilization of NR2. RIPA, which has been used previously to solubilize NMDA receptors, was only marginally effective. Harsher conditions of extraction, such as including chaotropic agents (1 M KI) were only marginally better that NaCl in solubilizing either subunit (data not shown). We found DOC at pH 9.0 to be most effective in solubilizing both NR1 and NR2 subunits, with solubilization at 37°C considerably better than at 4°C. While solubilization with DOC was better at pH 9.0 than pH 7.5, the pH alone was not a critical factor since Triton X-100 was no more effective at pH 9.0 that at pH 7.5. The differential solubility of NR1 and NR2 subunits observed with 1% Triton X-100, 1 M NaCl (Fig. 2A, lane 2) suggested that the NMDA receptor complex is dissociated more readily than it is solubilized. To determine if the NR1/NR2 receptor complex is intact after solubilization with DOC, co-immunoprecipitation and chemical cross-linking analyses were done. The solubilized receptor complex was immunoprecipitated with an antibody selective for the NR1 C2 cassette and the immunoprecipitate stained with anti-NR2A/B antibodies (Fig. 2B). After solubilization with DOC, NR2 subunits co-immunoprecipitated with NR1, while solubilization with Triton X-100 or RIPA showed little co-immunoprecipitation. To determine the size of the detergent-solubilized complex, and to determine if NR1 and NR2 subunits are present in the same complex, the DOC-solubilized complex from the synaptic membrane fraction was cross-linked with DSP. With increasing concentrations of DSP, three high molecular weight bands (Mr = 603,000 ± 7000; 700,000 ± 30,000; 750,000 ± 10,000) are stained with either anti-NR1 antibodies or anti-NR2A/B antibodies, concomitant with a decrease in the staining of the monomer (Fig. 3). The identical patterns and sizes of the cross-linked complexes suggest that the NR1 and NR2 subunits are present in the same complex. This was established for the highest molecular weight band by using the same immunoblot and stripping after the first antibody and reprobing with the second antibody. Because of the relatively low abundance in the lower molecular weight cross-linked bands, this approach was not effective in establishing that both subunits were present in these complexes (data not shown). Treatment of the cross-linked receptor with DTT restored staining of the monomer (data not shown). Cross-linking the receptor in synaptic membranes, before solubilization with detergent, produced large complexes that did not enter the gel suggesting a direct cross-linking with other components of the synaptic membranes. This result is consistent with a recent report (36Kornau H.-C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Google Scholar) showing a direct interaction of the NR2 subunit with PSD-95, a major component of the PSD. Preliminary analyses of NMDA receptor solubilization in total membrane fractions from brain showed a somewhat higher solubility of NR1 in 1% Triton X-100 compared to that observed in the synaptic membrane fraction. 2J. Blahos II and R. J. Wenthold, unpublished observation. This was explored further by comparing the Triton X-100 solubility of the microsome fraction and the synaptic membrane fraction (Fig. 4A). A pronounced difference in Triton X-100 solubility was observed between the two fractions with the NR1 from microsomes being nearly completely solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, while NR1 in synaptic membranes was nearly completely insoluble. The NR2 subunits were equally insoluble in both fractions. One possible explanation for these results is that the NR1 splice variants have different solubilities in Triton X-100, and that they are very differently distributed in microsomal and synaptic membrane fractions. To address this, the distribution of splice variants was analyzed in these two fractions, and no different distribution was found (Fig. 4B). To determine if there is a pattern of assembly between certain NR1 splice variants and NR2 subunits, co-immunoprecipitation analyses were done using antibodies made to fusion proteins of NR2A and NR2B. These antibodies have been previously characterized (45Wang Y.-H. Bosy T.Z. Yasuda R.P. Grayson D.R. Vicini S. Pizzorusso T. Wolfe B.B. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 176-183Google Scholar) and are specific for their respective subunits. Our results show that all NR1 splice variants are co-immunoprecipitated with both NR2A and NR2B (Fig. 5A), indicating no selective association between particular splice variants and NR2 subunits. Interestingly, however, our results showed very little co-immunoprecipitation of NR2A and NR2B subunits, suggesting that these two subunits may only rarely be part of the same receptor complex. To determine if similar conditions held for NR1 splice variants, we took advantage of the fact that NR1 subunits have either the C2 or the C2′ cassettes, but never both, and asked if these two variants co-immunoprecipitated. Our results show co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5B), indicating that at least two NR1 splice variants are found in a NMDA receptor complex and that different NR1 splice variants can be part of the same complex. In the present study we characterized the relationship between the NR1 splice variants and the NR2 subunits, NR2A and NR2B, using a series of antibodies selective for the subunits and splice variants. Three major findings are presented: 1) NMDA receptor subunits differ in their detergent solubilities. NR2 is nearly insoluble in Triton X-100 in both microsomal and synaptic membrane fractions, while NR1 in the microsomal fraction is Triton X-100-soluble but is insoluble in the synaptic membrane fraction. These results suggest a modification in the NR1 subunit when it is integrated into the synaptic membrane. 2) No pattern of assembly between NR1 splice variants and NR2 subunits was found. However, our results show complexes containing NR2A and NR2B are minor, suggesting that most receptor complexes contain only a single NR2 subunit or that assembly is regulated such that only one type of NR2 subunit is allowed in each complex. At least two different NR1 splice variants can be present in the same complex. 3) Chemical cross-linking of the detergent-solubilized receptor yields three high molecular weight complexes, Mr = 603,000, 700,000, and 750,000, all of which stain with antibodies to NR1 or to NR2 subunits. While the NMDA receptor subunits have been cloned and their properties studied using in vitro expression systems, knowledge of the biochemistry and cell biology of NMDA receptors in neurons is limited. Many of these studies depend on the detergent solubilization of the intact receptor complex. We find deoxycholate to be the most effective detergent with 35% of both NR1 and NR2 subunits solubilized at pH 9.0. Under these conditions the complex is intact, based on both co-immunoprecipitation data and cross-linking analyses showing 3 high molecular weight complexes that stain with antibodies to NR1 or NR2 subunits. Our findings are consistent with those of earlier studies, which assessed the detergent solubility of [3H]MK-801 ligand binding activity and found deoxycholate to be the only detergent which produced receptor complexes capable of binding the ligand (49McKernan R.M. Castro S. Poat J.A. Wong E.H.F. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 777-785Google Scholar, 50Ogita K. Yoneda Y. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1515-1520Google Scholar). Cross-linking the deoxycholate-solubilized receptor yielded complexes migrating at Mr = 603,000, 700,000, and 750,000. While these results are consistent with the receptor complex being comprised of multiple NR1 and NR2 subunits, the resolution is not sufficient to determine the number or exact composition of subunits. A previous study (22Brose N. Gasic G.P. Vetter D.E. Sullivan J.M. Heinemann S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22663-22671Google Scholar), in which the receptor was cross-linked in the synaptic membrane, showed the largest cross-linked component migrating at Mr = 730,000. Using non-denaturing gels, Chazot et al. (51Chazot P.L. Coleman S.K. Cik M. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24403-24409Google Scholar) determined a size of 780–850,000 daltons for the NMDA receptor complex formed in cells transfected with NR1 and NR2C or with NR1, NR2A, and NR2C. These data and ours would fit a complex of 4–6 subunits. In determining optimal conditions for solubilization of intact NMDA receptor complexes, we unexpectedly found that the NR1 and NR2 subunits are soluble to different degrees in Triton X-100. While receptors in the synaptic membranes were generally Triton X-100-insoluble, including 1 M NaCl with the detergent increased NR1 solubility but NR2 remained insoluble. More striking were results obtained on the microsomal fraction where NR1 is readily soluble in 1% Triton X-100 in low ionic strength buffer while NR2 is insoluble. In microsomes, even lower concentrations of Triton X-100 are effective in solubilizing NR1. A study of the detergent solubilities of other glutamate receptors,2 shows that NR1 is typical, having a detergent-soluble fraction associated with the microsomes and a detergent-insoluble fraction associated with synaptic membranes. This is consistent with the relatively large pool of receptor associated with intracellular membranes, which is seen for all glutamate receptors, including NMDA (28Petralia R.S. Yokotani N. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 667-696Google Scholar, 29Huntley G.W. Vickers J.C. Janssen W. Brose N. Heinemann S.F. Morrison J.H. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3603-3619Google Scholar, 38Petralia R.S. Wenthold R.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1992; 318: 329-354Google Scholar, 39Petralia R.S. Wang Y.-X. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6102-6120Google Scholar, 40Vickers J.C. Huntley G.W. Edwards A.M. Moran T. Rogers S.W. Heinemann S.F. Morrison J.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2982-2992Google Scholar, 41Martin L.J. Blackstone C.D. Levey A.I. Huganir R.L. Price D.L. Neuroscience. 1993; 53: 327-358Google Scholar). Thus, the Triton X-100-soluble pool may be that associated with intracellular membranes and the insoluble pool associated with synaptic membranes. The Triton X-100 insolubility of the NR2 subunit, therefore, differs from that of other glutamate receptor subunits. A possible explanation is that NR2 is linked to PSD-95 (36Kornau H.-C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Google Scholar), identified as a component of the postsynaptic density (52Cho K.-O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Google Scholar), through its C terminus. If the insolubility of NR2 is due to its interaction with PSD-95, it would imply that this interaction occurs well before NR2 is associated with the PSD since it is insoluble in the microsomal fraction. As an explanation for its insolubility, we cannot rule out the possibility of nonspecific aggregation or an artifactual association with PSD-95 during the homogenization or solubilization. In an attempt to control for the latter possibility, tissue was homogenized, incubated with antibodies to the C terminus of NR2A and NR2B with the objective to block the association of NR2 subunits with PSD-95, and then solubilized. However, this did not increase the detergent solubility of the NR2 subunit.2 The solubility of NR1 in microsomes with Triton X-100, while NR2 remains insoluble, suggests that the NMDA receptor complex is relatively easily disrupted. This is unlike that seen for either AMPA or kainate receptors, which are both optimally solubilized from brain using 1% Triton X-100 in high ionic strength buffer (42Wenthold R.J. Yokotani N. Doi K. Wada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 501-507Google Scholar, 43Wenthold R.J. Trumpy V.A. Zhu W.-S. Petralia R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1332-1339Google Scholar); the solubilized AMPA and kainate receptors retain their ligand binding properties, an indication of an intact receptor. It is possible that the solubility of NR1 in microsomes is due to the presence of homomeric NR1 receptors in this fraction, but unlikely since most of the NR1 (85%) is solubilized. A more likely explanation is that NR1 is modified when it is incorporated into the synaptic membrane to produce a Triton X-100-insoluble complex, which could be formed through a tighter interaction with NR2 or with another PSD protein. Such a phenomenon has been observed for connexin-43, which assembles into gap junctions (53Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1357-1374Google Scholar). Intracellular connexin-43 is soluble in 1% Triton X-100, but becomes insoluble after phosphorylation and incorporation into gap junctions. Our results may suggest that the NMDA receptor complex is not fully assembled until it reaches the synapse, and one must even entertain the possibility that NR1 and NR2 are transported to the synapse as two separate molecular complexes, and that the final complex is assembled at the synapse. It has been demonstrated that integral membrane proteins can assemble into oligomers outside the endoplasmic reticulum as demonstrated for the α and β subunits of Na,K-ATPase (54DeTomaso A.W. Blanco G. Mercer R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 55-69Google Scholar); Sf9 cells individually infected with α or β subunits formed functional ATPase when the cells were fused. Such a mechanism would provide another level of regulation of the expression of functional NMDA receptors. The NR1 splice variants and NR2 subunits have distinct developmental and regional patterns of expression, and the distribution of these forms correlates with that of functionally different NMDA receptors (23Butler A.L. Larson H.C. Schneider B.E. Beaton J.A. Morrisett R.A. Monaghan D.T. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5471-5484Google Scholar). However, the patterns overlap, and many neurons express multiple NR1 splice variants and perhaps two or three NR2 subunits. For example, motor neurons of the lumbar spinal cord express all NR1 splice variants except NR1-3 (26Tölle T.R. Berthele A. Laurie D.J. Seeburg P.H. Zieglgänsberger W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1235-1244Google Scholar), and hippocampal pyramidal cells express both NR2A and NR2B (20Zukin R.S. Bennett M.V.L. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 306-313Google Scholar). Therefore, multiple functionally distinct NMDA receptors could be assembled within the same neurons and targeted to different populations of synapses. One possibility would be for specific assembly between an NR2 subunit and an NR1 splice variant, as has been suggested previously (37Sheng M. Cummings J. Roldman L.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 368: 144-147Google Scholar). Our immunoprecipitation results do not support such a mechanism since antibodies selective for NR2A and NR2B both co-immunoprecipitated all splice variants of NR1, with no apparent quantitative differences. However, the lack of co-immunoprecipitation of NR2A and NR2B subunits suggests that most receptor complexes contain only NR2A or NR2B subunits. The simplest way for a neuron that expresses both subunits to produce a complex containing only NR2A or NR2B is to limit the complex to a single NR2 subunit. If multiple NR2 subunits are present in each complex, other mechanisms would be needed to regulate the assembly process. While in situ hybridization studies show several areas of apparent NR2A and NR2B co-expression (31Standaert D.G. Testa C.M. Young A.B. Penney Jr., J.B. J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 343: 1-16Google Scholar, 32Akazawa C. Shigemoto R. Bessho Y. Nakanishi S. Mizuno N. J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 347: 150-160Google Scholar, 33Monyer H. Burnashev N. Laurie D.J. Sakmann B.

It is possible that neurons that appear to express both subunits in fact contain subpopulations that express only a single NR2 subunit. Since we find a slight co-immunoprecipitation of NR2A and NR2B, our results may simply reflect the fact that very few neurons express both subunits. Expression studies in HEK293 cells have shown that NMDA receptor complexes can be formed, which contain both NR2A and NR2C (21Wafford K.A. Bain C.J. LeBourdelles B. Whiting P.J. Kemp J.A. Neuroreport. 1993; 4: 1347-1349Google Scholar, 51Chazot P.L. Coleman S.K. Cik M. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24403-24409Google Scholar), and whether or not this is unique to the NR2C subunit awaits further study. We thank Drs. M. Hollmann, S. Heinemann, P. Seeburg, and S. Nakanishi for providing cDNA clones; Dr. B. B. Wolfe for the NR2A and NR2B antibodies; and Dr. R. Petralia for critically reading this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1998277512,"The human p55 tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (TR55) initiates at least two independent signaling cascades. The acidic sphingomyelinase (A-SMase) pathway involves a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C, an endosomal A-SMase, and controls expression of multiple TNF-responsive genes through induction of transcription factors such as NF-κB. The neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) pathway comprises a membrane-bound N-SMase, proline-directed protein kinases, as well as phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> and appears critical for the inflammatory responses induced by TNF. While the domain of TR55 that induces A-SMase is probably identical to the death domain, the exact location and extent of a putative N-SMase activation domain are still unknown. Structure-function analysis of TR55 deletion mutants revealed a novel region of 11 amino acids at position 309–319 that is both necessary and sufficient for activation of N-SMase. The N-SMase activation domain is distinct from the death domain and incapable of induction of A-SMase, NF-κB, and cytotoxicity. Taken together, our results suggest that a functionally independent region of TR55 is responsible for selectively initiating the N-SMase pathway that couples to an important inflammatory signaling cascade."

In order to begin to investigate the factors controlling rat liver sodium-dependent bile acid cotransporter (ntcp) gene expression, we isolated ≈30 kilobase pairs of rat genomic DNA in three overlapping λphage clones. The rat ntcp gene is distributed over 16.5 kilobase pairs as five exons. Primer extension analysis revealed two closely spaced transcription initiation sites, 27 and 41 nucleotides downstream of a TATA sequence. Regulation of transcription was investigated first by transfection of primary rat hepatocytes by a series of 5′-deleted rat ntcp promoter-driven luciferase constructs (from ≈−6 kilobase pairs to −59 base pairs of upstream sequences, terminating at nucleotide +47), identifying a minimal promoter element: nucleotide −158 to +47. This minimal promoter was active in transfected HepG2, but inactive in NIH3T3, Caco-2, and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, indicating that the determinants of hepatocyte-specific expression reside within this region. The individual elements within the minimal promoter were investigated via transfection of HepG2 cells by a series of 20 mutant plasmids, each containing a 10-base pair sequential block mutation. Eight mutant constructs profoundly suppressed promoter activity; encompassing sequences from −66 to +4 nt, and +15 to +24 nucleotides, while no other 10-base pair mutation significantly interfered with minimal promoter activity.

INTRODUCTIONThe flow of bile is fundamentally dependent upon the synthesis, transport, and recirculation of bile acids (reviewed in 1Nathanson M.H. Boyer J.L. Hepatology. 1991; 14: 551-566Google Scholar and 2Suchy F.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 1993; 13: 235-247Google Scholar). Bile acids are synthesized exclusively in the liver via a multistep transformation of cholesterol precursor molecules (3Russell D.W. Setchell K.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4737-4749Google Scholar, 4Vlahcevic Z.R. Heuman D.M. Hylemon P.B. Hepatology. 1991; 13: 590-600Google Scholar). Once synthesized and amidated, bile acids are transported across the canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte to participate in the intraluminal digestion and absorption of a variety of hydrophobic compounds. In addition, the polar flux of bile acids across the canalicular membrane is central to the generation and maintenance of bile flow, and thus essential to the proper excretion of drugs and toxins into the biliary tract. Bile acids are absorbed throughout the small intestine, with the principal component being an efficient, active, sodium-dependent transporter residing on the apical surface of ileal enterocytes (5Hofmann A.F. Schteingart C.D. Lillienau J. Ann. Med. 1991; 23: 169-175Google Scholar). Bile acids are then returned to the liver via the portal circulation, and reenter the hepatocyte across the basolateral membrane via predominantly a sodium-dependent mechanism (2Suchy F.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 1993; 13: 235-247Google Scholar, 6Boyer J.L. Meier P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 517-533Google Scholar). This process is remarkably efficient, with less than 5% of bile acids fecally excreted, and appears to be highly regulated by several factors including development, diet, hormones, cholesterol homeostatsis, and neural mechanisms (7Hofmann A.F.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1340-1347Google Scholar). Screening of appropriate cDNA libraries have also resulted in the cloning and initial characterizations of sodium-dependent transporters from human liver (NTCP) (11Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1326-1331Google Scholar) and rat ileum (Asbt) (12Shneider B.L. Dawson P.A. Christie D.M. Hardikar W. Wong M.H. Suchy F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 745-754Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization of these cloned transport proteins in heterologous systems revealed close parallels to transport properties first described in vivo. Moreover, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated appropriate membrane-restricted localization of these transporters (12Shneider B.L. Dawson P.A. Christie D.M. Hardikar W. Wong M.H. Suchy F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 745-754Google Scholar, 13Ananthanarayanan M. Ng O.C. Boyer J.L. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G637-G643Google Scholar, 14Stieger B. Hagenbuch B. Landmann L. Hochli M. Schroeder A. Meier P.J. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 1781-1787Google Scholar). Of particular interest are the similarities of both DNA sequences and proposed protein secondary structure of the Ntcp and ileal apical transporters (10Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Craddock A.L. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1340-1347Google Scholar). By hydropathy analyses, both proteins contain seven similarly placed potential membrane-spanning domains. The rat ntcp and human NTCP genes have been localized to syntenic chromosomes rat 6 (location q24) (15Cohn M.A. Rounds D.J. Karpen S.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 60Google Scholar) and human 14 (11Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1326-1331Google Scholar).The factors regulating the developmental and tissue-specific expression of these genes are largely unknown, but appear to focus at the level of control of mRNA transcription (12Shneider B.L. Dawson P.A. Christie D.M. Hardikar W. Wong M.H. Suchy F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 745-754Google Scholar, 16Boyer J.L. Hagenbuch B. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl.

Numerous studies over the past decade have demonstrated that transcription is directed and regulated by the coordinated interplay of nuclear DNA-binding proteins recognizing cognate binding sites encoded in DNA, typically, but not exclusively, clustered in the 5′-flanking region (20Locker J. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Gene Transcription: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, OxfordUK1993: 321Google Scholar, 21Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Google Scholar). An understanding of the mechanisms regulating transcription relies first upon the cloning and characterization of the gene structure before functional analyses may proceed. Here we present the genomic cloning, exon/intron organization, and analysis of the 5′-upstream flanking DNA sequence of the first of the cloned bile acid transporters: the rat ntcp gene. Furthermore, we present evidence that basal expression resides in a relatively short minimal promoter region that also directs liver-specific expression. Three elements within this minimal promoter element were determined to contribute significantly, and individually, to the expression of the rat ntcp gene promoter: a TATA element, an HNF1 binding site, and a novel palindrome bound by an unknown liver-enriched factor.DISCUSSIONWe present here the genomic cloning of the first cloned bile acid transporter, the rat ntcp gene, as well as initial structural and functional studies of its promoter region. Three overlapping λphage clones of rat genomic DNA were identified and subjected to restriction enzyme mapping, and exons as well as exon/intron boundaries were sequenced. The rat ntcp gene spans 16.5 kb of rat chromosome 6q24 (15Cohn M.A. Rounds D.J. Karpen S.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 60Google Scholar), represented as 5 exons separated by four introns (Fig. 1 and Table II). No discrepancies were noted between the DNA sequences determined during the course of these studies and those published for the ntcp cDNA (8Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Foguet M. Lubbert H. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10629-10633Google Scholar). All exon/intron junctions conformed to known consensus splice donor and splice acceptor motifs (36Mount S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 459-472Google Scholar). Exons did not interrupt any of the seven proposed computer-generated TM domains of this membrane bound protein. The organization is similar to the organization of other membrane transporters, including the human Na+/glucose cotransporter gene (SGLT1) (59Turk E. Martin M.G. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15204-15209Google Scholar), which is the only other sodium-dependent transporter genomically cloned. Unlike the putative TM domains in the SGLT1 gene, where 11 of 12 are each individually encoded within separate exons, those in the rat ntcp gene are clustered. This type of organization is similar to that of the seven membrane spanning protein rhodopsin, which is also divided into five exons (60Nathans J. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1983; 34: 807-814Google Scholar). The evolutionary, phylogenetic, and structural importance of the exon/intron organization of the rat ntcp gene will depend upon features uncovered by genomic cloning of homologous transporters. For example, it would not be surprising if significant homologies are identified by comparing the genomic organization of the rat ntcp gene and the recently cloned ileal Na+-dependent bile acid transporter (10Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Craddock A.L. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1340-1347Google Scholar, 12Shneider B.L. Dawson P.A. Christie D.M. Hardikar W. Wong M.H. Suchy F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 745-754Google Scholar) given the significant amino acid similarities and virtually superimposable hydropathy plot analyses of these two genes.One of the principal goals of characterizing the regulation of the rat ntcp gene is to understand the factors involved in directing its tissue-restricted and developmental patterns of expression. In general, basal, tissue-specific, and developmental expression of eukaryotic genes is driven by the complex interaction of sequence-specific trans-acting factors with their cognate recognition sequences (21Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Google Scholar, 61Maniatis T. Goodbourn S. Fischer J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1237-1245Google Scholar). These regulatory elements are usually grouped as those that act in proximity to the mRNA start site (i.e. promoter elements), and those that act at a distance (enhancer elements). By employing 5′-deletional analysis (Fig. 4), the sequence from −158 to +47 nt supplied essentially the same level of expression of a reporter gene as that of 5′-flanking regions up to 6 kb in size. Consequently, this 205-bp fragment was identified as a minimal rat ntcp promoter and indicates that no significant distal elements exist to direct basal expression in transfected HepG2 and primary rat hepatocyte cultures. It is quite possible that such enhancer elements exist either further upstream than 6 kb or downstream of nt +47, and would not be evaluated with these constructs. Moreover, elements within 6 kb of the start of transcription might be important in vivo, which could best be evaluated by experiments involving the creation of transgenic mice possessing appropriate constructs.The minimal promoter directs expression only in primary rat hepatocytes, and cells derived from human hepatoblastoma, HepG2 cells, suggesting that it contains all necessary cis-acting factors for liver-restricted expression (Fig. 5). Although no construct was significantly expressed in NIH3T3 cells, there was a small amount of expression from the larger constructs in Caco-2 and MDCK cells, perhaps from the recognition of cryptic elements by factors in these epithelially derived cells, but the minimal promoter was inactive in these cells. Both cell lines derive from tissues that can transport bile acids (12Shneider B.L. Dawson P.A. Christie D.M. Hardikar W. Wong M.H. Suchy F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 745-754Google Scholar), and might therefore possess factors that can recognize elements in the rat ntcp promoter. Interestingly, DNase I footprinting with nuclear extracts from expressing and nonexpressing cells revealed similar patterns (see below).The nucleotide sequence of the immediate upstream region of the rat ntcp gene contains several features characteristic of a liver-specific promoter (Fig. 3), both within and upstream of the minimal promoter. Analysis of the DNA sequence in the 5′-flanking region revealed potential binding sites for many well characterized transcription factors, including some which are widely expressed, and others more restricted to gut-derived tissues. Although not necessary for basal activity in transfected cells, the region upstream of the minimal promoter contains homologies to several factor binding sites. The ubiquitously expressed OCT, CAAT, NF1, and Sp1 which have been implicated in the cooperative regulation of several liver-specific genes, including the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-2 (62Boisclair Y.R. Brown A.L. Casola S. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24892-24901Google Scholar), tyrosine aminotransferase (63DeVack C. Lupp B. Nichols M. Kowenz-Leutz E. Schmid W. Schutz G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 459-465Google Scholar), α1 acid glycoprotein (64Ray B.K. Ray A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 147: 253-258Google Scholar), and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase gene (65Lemaigre F.P. Durviaux S.M. Rousseau G.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1099-1106Google Scholar) seem to be unimportant for basal rat ntcp promoter expression. Also in this region are potential binding sites for factors involved in the regulation of gene expression by cholesterol (SRE) and bile acids (BARE). SREs are present in the promoter region of cholesterol 7α- hydroxylase (C7α-OH) genes (66Crestani M. Galli G. Chiang J.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 451-460Google Scholar, 67Tzung K.W. Ishimura-Oka K. Kihara S. Oka K. Chan L. Genomics. 1994; 1: 244-247Google Scholar, 68Molowa D.T. Chen W.S. Cimis G.M. Tan C.P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2539-2544Google Scholar), as is a site homologous to a recently proposed bile acid response element (BARE, Fig. 3). The presence of common elements in C7α-OH and ntcp promoter regions leads to the speculation that a linkage between the regulation of bile acid synthesis and transport gene expression might involve common ligands: steroids, thyroid hormone (S/TRE in Fig. 3), or perhaps even sterols or bile acids. We have preliminary evidence of transcriptional suppression of the rat ntcp promoter by bile acids, but the actual regulatory element has not been determined (18Karpen S. Ananthanarayanan M. Hagenbuch B. Meier P. Suchy F.J. Gastroenterology. 1993; 104: A925Google Scholar). Studies directed toward uncovering these potential links are currently underway.Since the minimal promoter appears to contain both basal and liver-restricted elements for expression, a systematic investigation of individual elements and DNA-protein interactions was undertaken. By a combination of 10-bp block mutations, DNase I footprinting, and gel mobility shift assays three regions are of principal importance were identified-sequences represented within footprints A and B, and the TATA box. Sequences bound in footprint C do not appear important for basal rat ntcp promoter activity since no mutation in this region was of functional significance. Perhaps universally expressed factors that recognize the sequence AGGTCA (members of the steroid/thyroid/retinoic acid receptor family) provide a footprint in vitro, yet are unnecessary for basal expression in transfected cells.We have provided evidence that members of the HNF1 family binds within footprint A, and that such interactions are integral for rat ntcp expression (mutants −16 and −6 in Fig. 7). This binding pattern is formed in nuclear extracts from all cells except spleen and NIH3T3 cells in both DNase I footprinting (Fig. 8) and gel mobility shift assays (Fig. 9). Previous studies have documented that HNF1α is expressed in liver and intestinal cells (56Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Hsieh C.L. Francke U. Crabtree G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9838-9842Google Scholar, 57Wu G.D. Chen L. Forslund K. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17080-17085Google Scholar), while HNF1β is expressed in lung, kidney, and intestine (54Mendel D.B. Hansen L.P. Graves M.K. Conley P.B. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1042-1056Google Scholar). Both proteins bind to the same series of recognition sites and could explain the virtually identical nature of footprints and shifted bands in liver, HepG2, Caco-2, and MDCK cells.Rat ntcp expression follows a developmental profile that just precedes functional sodium-dependent bile acid transport (19Hardikar W. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20841-20846Google Scholar). Rat ntcp mRNA is detectable on day 18 of rat gestation, with adult levels quickly reached by one week of life (16Boyer J.L. Hagenbuch B. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 435-438Google Scholar, 19Hardikar W. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20841-20846Google Scholar). Interestingly, the developmental expression of HNF1α virtually parallels that of rat ntcp mRNA, suggesting it plays a significant part in rat ntcp developmental expression (69Van den Hoff M.J. Vermeulen J.L. De Boer P.A. Lamers W.H. Moorman A.F. Histochem. J. 1994; 26: 20-31Google Scholar).Finally, the binding site within footprint B appears to be recognized by a liver-enriched sequence-specific nuclear factor(s) of unknown identity. The binding site contains a palindrome 5′-CATAAGGTTATG-3′, which, when disrupted, is unable to bind factor(s) from liver nuclear extracts (Fig. 10). Two closely migrating specific complexes formed with the wild type probe −56 to −37, yet 3-bp mutations in either half of the palindrome eliminated this sequence's ability to form such complexes. There are several possible explanations for these findings. The lower band could represent the trivial consequence of proteolytic digestion of a single binding protein, despite inclusion of four protease inhibitors in each step of extract preparation. The two bands could represent two different proteins have the same recognition sequence requiring an intact palindrome. There could be one protein that binds to the palindrome, and another factor is bound by protein:protein interactions to the first. The top band could be a covalent modification of a single DNA-binding protein. And finally, the presence of a palindrome may suggest the possibility of a factor that binds as a monomer or dimer. The identity of the factor(s) binding to the palindrome in Footprint B awaits further biochemical characterizations.In summary, these studies provide evidence that multiple nuclear proteins regulate the transcription of the rat ntcp gene promoter. Moreover, a relatively small 5′-flanking region contains all necessary elements to direct basal and liver-restricted expression. At least three factors are necessary for full rat ntcp promoter activity in transfected cells: a TATA element, an HNF1 binding site, and a novel palindrome in footprint B that is bound by unknown liver-enriched factor(s). These experiments should provide direction for future studies on the developmental and hormonal regulation of bile acid transport, as well as on the interactive role of common regulatory proteins in bile acid transport and synthesis gene expression. INTRODUCTIONThe flow of bile is fundamentally dependent upon the synthesis, transport, and recirculation of bile acids (reviewed in 1Nathanson M.H. Boyer J.L. Hepatology. 1991; 14: 551-566Google Scholar and 2Suchy F.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 1993; 13: 235-247Google Scholar). Bile acids are synthesized exclusively in the liver via a multistep transformation of cholesterol precursor molecules (3Russell D.W. Setchell K.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4737-4749Google Scholar, 4Vlahcevic Z.R. Heuman D.M. Hylemon P.B. Hepatology. 1991; 13: 590-600Google Scholar). Once synthesized and amidated, bile acids are transported across the canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte to participate in the intraluminal digestion and absorption of a variety of hydrophobic compounds. In addition, the polar flux of bile acids across the canalicular membrane is central to the generation and maintenance of bile flow, and thus essential to the proper excretion of drugs and toxins into the biliary tract. Bile acids are absorbed throughout the small intestine, with the principal component being an efficient, active, sodium-dependent transporter residing on the apical surface of ileal enterocytes (5Hofmann A.F. Schteingart C.D. Lillienau J. Ann. Med. 1991; 23: 169-175Google Scholar). Bile acids are then returned to the liver via the portal circulation, and reenter the hepatocyte across the basolateral membrane via predominantly a sodium-dependent mechanism (2Suchy F.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 1993; 13: 235-247Google Scholar, 6Boyer J.L. Meier P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 517-533Google Scholar). This process is remarkably efficient, with less than 5% of bile acids fecally excreted, and appears to be highly regulated by several factors including development, diet, hormones, cholesterol homeostatsis, and neural mechanisms (7Hofmann A.F. Sleisenger M.H. Fordtran J.S. Gastrointestinal Disease: Pathophysiology/Diagnosis/Management. 5th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1993: 127Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1999327905,"Expansion of CTG repeat sequences is associated with several human genetic diseases. We have examined the consequences of CTG repeat expansion for nucleosome assembly and positioning. Short CTG repeats are found within the most favored DNA sequences yet defined for nucleosome assembly. We find that as few as six CTG repeats will facilitate nucleosome assembly to a similar extent as the 50 or more repeats found in disease genes. Thus an increase in nucleosome stability on expansion of existing triplet repeats is unlikely to explain the acquisition of the disease phenotype. However, the CTG repeat sequence is efficiently wrapped around the histone octamer, preferring to associate with histones at the nucleosomal dyad. Thus short segments CTG repeat sequence will facilitate the assembly of a stable positioned nucleosome which might contribute to the expansion phenomenon and the functional organization of chromatin.

The CTG trinucleotide repeats are found associated with certain genes whose products are necessary for correct cell function. Aberrant gene expression or the synthesis of a mutant protein from the gene following expansion of the number of CTG trinucleotide repeats, leads to the disease phenotype. The molecular mechanisms leading the number of CTG repeats to increase from the range of 6 to 50 found in normal individuals to the greater than 50 repeats found in the chromosomes of diseased individuals are unknown. Recent attention has focussed on the biophysical properties of expanded CTG trinucleotide repeats, the nucleoprotein complexes that they might assemble in vivo and their potential influence on transcription and replication (Kohwi et al. 26Kohwi Y. Wang H. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 21: 5651-5655Google Scholar; Chastain et al., 7Chastain P.D. Eichler E.E. Kang S. Nelson D.L. Levene S.D. Sinden R.R.

CTG repeats from genes associated with various diseases confer anomalous rapid electrophoretic gel mobility on DNA (Chastain et al., 7Chastain P.D. Eichler E.E. Kang S. Nelson D.L. Levene S.D. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16125-16131Google Scholar). Anomalous gel mobility is consistent with a 20% increase in DNA persistence length. This is most simply explained by a reduction in DNA flexibility and/or intrinsic curvature relative to mixed-sequence DNA (Chastain et al., 7Chastain P.D. Eichler E.E. Kang S. Nelson D.L. Levene S.D. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16125-16131Google Scholar). Consistent with this result, CTG repeats exhibit no rotational preference in wrapping around the histones within a nucleosome (Satchwell et al., 47Satchwell S.C. Drew H.R. Travers A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 659-675Google Scholar). This lack of rotational preference for wrapping around the core histones coupled to an apparent increase in DNA persistence length is remarkable, since other experiments indicate that expanded CTG repeat sequences create the strongest known natural core histone-binding sequences and nucleosome positioning elements (Wang et al., 55Wang Y.-H. Amirhaeri S. Kang S. Wells R.D. Griffith J.D. Science. 1995; 265: 669-671Google Scholar; Wang and Griffith, 54Wang Y.-H. Griffith J. Genomics. 1995; 25: 570-573Google Scholar). Previously documented DNA sequences that favor interaction with core histones and direct nucleosome positioning contain intrinsically curved or flexible DNA (Shrader and Crothers, 49Shrader T.E. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7418-7422Google Scholar; Wolffe and Drew, 57Wolffe A.P. Drew H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus there is an apparent contradiction between the reduction in DNA flexibility and/or curvature in expanded CTG repeats (Chastain et al., 7Chastain P.D. Eichler E.E. Kang S. Nelson D.L. Levene S.D. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16125-16131Google Scholar) and the increase in affinity for the histone octamer within the nucleosome (Wang and Griffith, 54Wang Y.-H. Griffith J. Genomics. 1995; 25: 570-573Google Scholar). An increase in nucleosomal stability over expanded CTG repeats could potentially explain the increased protection of DNA segments containing triplet repeat expansions from DNase I cleavage observed in vivo (Otten and Tapscott, 39Otten A.D. Tapscott S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5465-5469Google Scholar), the decline in expression of disease genes containing such expansions within the transcription unit (Carango et al., 6Carango P. Noble J.E. Marks H.G.

Ishikawa Y. Shimano H. Osada S. Nishihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20898-20900Google Scholar). Nucleosomes are known to protect DNA from nucleases (Noll, 36Noll M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1974; 1: 1573-1578Google Scholar), to potentially impede the progression of RNA polymerase II (Izban and Luse, 24Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 683-696Google Scholar; Verdin et al., 53Verdin E. Paras Jr., P. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Google Scholar), and to repress transcription initiation over promoters (Knezetic and Luse, 25Knezetic J.A. Luse D.S. Cell. 1986; 45: 95-104Google Scholar; Workman and Roeder, 60Workman J.L. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1987; 51: 613-622Google Scholar; Lorch et al., 29Lorch Y. La Pointe J.W. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1987; 49: 203-210Google Scholar). In this paper we examine the number of CTG repeats necessary to facilitate association of the histone octamer and the influence of flanking DNA sequences. We determine the structural features of this DNA in the nucleosome and the favored position of CTG repeat sequences within the nucleosome. We find that the phenomenon of nucleosome stability (Wang and Griffith, 54Wang Y.-H. Griffith J. Genomics. 1995; 25: 570-573Google Scholar) is conferred by relatively few CTG repeats such as found within normal individuals, and that expansion of CTG repeats does not increase the stability of histone-DNA interactions. The preference of CTG repeats to associate with core histones at the dyad axis of the nucleosome may contribute to the increased affinity of these sequences for interaction with core histones and the phenomenon of nucleosome positioning (Wang et al., 55Wang Y.-H. Amirhaeri S. Kang S. Wells R.D. Griffith J.D. Science. 1995; 265: 669-671Google Scholar). DNA at the dyad axis of the nucleosome is known to have a relatively straight path in spite of histone association and to adopt an unusual helical periodicity (Hayes et al., 17Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7405-7409Google Scholar, 19Hayes J.J. Clark D.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plasmids containing a portion of the human DRPLA 1The abbreviations used are: DRPLAdentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophyPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s). (dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy) gene were a kind gift of Dr. Shoji Tsuji of the Brain Research Institute, Niigata University, Japan. These were obtained by PCR amplification of patient DNA and contained the region of the DRPLA gene between +1659 and +1784 (Nagafuchi et al., 35Nagafuchi S. Yanagisawa H. Ohsaki E. Shirayama T. Tadokoro K. Inoue T. Yamada M. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8 (b): 177-182Google Scholar). This region was cloned into a pT7Blue (R) vector (Novagen) by the T-vector cloning method (Marchuk et al., 31Marchuk D. Drumm M. Saulino A. Collins F.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1154Google Scholar). The amplified fragment used in this study derived from patients not having the disease contains a (CTG)10 segment, the plasmid incorporating this fragment is referred to as pCTG10. The fragments amplified from DRPLA patients contain 55 and 62 CTG repeats; incorporated into plasmids pCTG55 and pCTG62, respectively. Bluescript plasmid (Stratagene) containing the Xenopus histone gene cluster (Xlh3a-BS) (Perry et al., 40Perry M. Thomsen G.H. Roeder R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 479-499Google Scholar) was a kind gift of R. Roeder. The Xenopus borealis 5 S RNA gene was contained in plasmid XP-10 (Wolffe et al., 59Wolffe A.P. Jordan E. Brown D.D. Cell. 1986; 44: 381-389Google Scholar). dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy polymerase chain reaction base pair(s). Plasmids were cut with the indicated restriction enzymes, labeled using a fill-in reaction, and the appropriate fragments were gel-isolated. Reconstitution was as described (Shrader and Crothers, 49Shrader T.E. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7418-7422Google Scholar) except that 10 ng of labeled DNA, 1 µg of cores, and 1 µg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA was used. All volumes were scaled down appropriately and incubation was at 37°C instead of room temperature. Separation on nondenaturing gels was as described (Godde et al., 15Godde J.S. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4557-4564Google Scholar) and quantitation was by densitometeric analysis. DNA from 3 × 100-µl PCR reactions (10 µg) was purified using a PCR clean-up kit (Promega) and used to reconstitute nucleosomes by dialysis (Camerini-Otero et al., 5Camerini-Otero R.D. Sollner-Webb B. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1976; 8: 333-347Google Scholar). Histones were purified from HeLa cells (O'Neill et al., 37O'Neill T.E. Roberge M. Bradbury E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 67-78Google Scholar) and were used at a ratio of 0.8 µg of histones/1 µg of DNA. The histone-DNA mixture was made 2 M NaCl (100 µl total) and dialyzed overnight into 2 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. After this step, dialysis was into 1.2, 1, and 0.75 M NaCl in the above buffer with changes occurring every 2 h. Finally, the sample was dialyzed overnight into the above buffer without salt or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride added. Sixteen µl of the resulting sample was made 1 mM CaCl2 and digested for 5 min at room temperature with 0.075-0.15 units of micrococcal nuclease (Worthington). The reaction was stopped with a 2.5 × molar excess of EDTA and made 0.25% SDS and 0.3 M sodium acetate followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The resulting fragments were labeled with kinase and run on a 6% polyacrylamide gel for isolation of the 146-bp band reflecting DNA within the nucleosome core that represents a stable kinetic intermediate in the digestion of nucleosomal DNA (Noll, 36Noll M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1974; 1: 1573-1578Google Scholar; van Holde, 1989). Isolated DNA was cut with restriction enzymes as indicated and run on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel for analysis (see Godde et al. (15Godde J.S. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4557-4564Google Scholar)). Nucleosome particles used for footprinting were assembled by the exchange reaction as described previously (Tatchell and van Holde, 52Tatchell K.E. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1977; 24: 5295-5303Google Scholar; Godde et al., 15Godde J.S. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4557-4564Google Scholar). The isolation of the chicken erythrocyte mononucleosomes used in this reaction as well as the details of DNase I footprinting were also as described previously (Hayes et al., 19Hayes J.J. Clark D.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88 (b): 6829-6833Google Scholar). Hydroxyl radical reactions were as described (Wolffe and Hayes, 58Wolffe A.P. Hayes J.J. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 314-330Google Scholar). Autoradiographs were scanned using a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer; data was read using Microsoft Excel, plotted using Cricket Graph, and presented in its final form using MacDraw II. The display of rotational setting was created by assigning peak values to densitometer plots, aligning these to the gene sequence using the G-reaction data, and by graphing this information using Microsoft Excel. One of the most preferred natural DNA fragments for association with the histone octamer and one of the strongest natural nucleosome positioning sequences is found within the X.borealis somatic 5 S RNA gene (Rhodes, 44Rhodes D. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3473-3482Google Scholar; Hayes et al., 17Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7405-7409Google Scholar; Schild et al., 48Schild C. Claret F.-X. Wahli W. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 423-433Google Scholar). The precise determinants of preferential histone association and the mechanism by which the histone octamer is positioned relative to the 5 S RNA gene sequence are not entirely understood (FitzGerald and Simpson, 11FitzGerald P.C. Simpson R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15318-15324Google Scholar; Schrader and Crothers, 1989; Hayes et al., 18Hayes J.J. Bashkin J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30 (a): 8434-8440Google Scholar). However, hydroxyl radical cleavage has shown that the naked 5 S DNA contains a region of intrinsic structure that is located 15–70 bp downstream of the region of dyad symmetry and which is retained once DNA is wrapped in a nucleosome (Hayes et al., 17Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7405-7409Google Scholar). This leads to the hypothesis that pre-existing elements of DNA structure might facilitate the highly constrained wrapping of DNA within the nucleosome (Hayes et al., 18Hayes J.J. Bashkin J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30 (a): 8434-8440Google Scholar, 19Hayes J.J. Clark D.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88 (b): 6829-6833Google Scholar). It has recently been described how DNA sequences containing trinucleotide repeats in the form of CTGn position nucleosomes with greater affinity than any previously described DNA sequence, including the X.borealis 5 S RNA gene (Wang and Griffith, 54Wang Y.-H. Griffith J. Genomics. 1995; 25: 570-573Google Scholar). We wished to examine the direct contribution of the CTGn repeats to histone-DNA interactions within the nucleosome. We made use of the Xenopus laevis histone gene cluster which contains a stretch of six CTG trinucleotide repeats downstream of the coding sequence for histone H4 (Perry et al., 40Perry M. Thomsen G.H. Roeder R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 479-499Google Scholar). We have tested whether the segment of the Xenopus H4 gene containing the six CTG repeats would preferentially assemble nucleosomes. The standard assay for preferential formation was pioneered by 49Shrader T.E. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7418-7422Google Scholar and involves reconstitution of nucleosomes by an exchange reaction in the presence of both the labeled sequence of interest and unlabeled competitor DNA, followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The association of the histone H4 gene fragment containing the six CTG repeats with the histone octamer is favored (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 4) compared to the formation of nucleosomes on the 5 S RNA gene (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 9) (see Table I for a quantification of the results). Comparable high efficiencies of nucleosome formation are obtained with a fragment of the human DRPLA gene containing 10 CTG repeats (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 5). Thus relatively short tracts of CTG repeats can facilitate nucleosome assembly.Table IComparative free energies in nucleosome formationDNAFree energycal/mol5 S RNA gene−1750Histone H4 gene−3206H4 ΔCTG−1958H4 ΔCTG/CGG−1885CTG10−2942CTG55−2707CTG62−2801Mononucleosomal DNA0 Open table in a new tab We next examined the consequences of deleting the trinucleotide repeat sequences from the Xenopus H4 gene on preferential nucleosome assembly. The Xenopus histone H4 gene contains not only a stretch of CTG trinucleotides as in the DRPLA gene but also a stretch of CGG repeats upstream of the CTG trinucleotides. Interestingly, this almost exactly mimics the arrangement of the triplet repeats found in the human gene which causes Huntington's Disease (Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993). Deletion of the CTG repeats from the Xenopus H4 gene reduced the efficiency of nucleosome assembly (Fig. 1A, lane 7). The relative free energy of nucleosome formation on the H4 gene fragment following deletion of the CTG repeats is comparable to that of the 5 S RNA gene (Table I). We next deleted the CGG repeats as well as the CTG repeats. This deletion reduces the efficiency of nucleosome assembly of the H4 gene fragment to the level of the 5 S RNA gene (Fig. 1A, lane 8; Table I). We conclude that the CTG and CGG repeats make a major contribution toward the preferential association of the H4 gene fragment with the histone octamer. Since a deletion of trinucleotide repeats within the Xenopus H4 gene leads to a decrease in the efficiency with which the histone octamer associates with this DNA (Table I), we next wished to investigate the effects on nucleosome formation of an expansion of these repeats. It has been reported that expanded repeats in the myotonic dystrophy gene lead to nucleosome formation efficiencies roughly twice that observed (Table I) for the “normal” DRPLA gene containing 10 CTG repeats (Wang and Griffith, 54Wang Y.-H. Griffith J. Genomics. 1995; 25: 570-573Google Scholar). We next determined the effects of increasing the number of CTG repeats from 10 to either 55 or 62 repeats. This was done using DNA derived from patients exhibiting disease symptoms (Nagafuchi et al. (35Nagafuchi S. Yanagisawa H. Ohsaki E. Shirayama T. Tadokoro K. Inoue T. Yamada M. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8 (b): 177-182Google Scholar), gift of Shoji Tsuji). The propensity to form nucleosomes is not increased as the length of the trinucleotide repeats is expanded (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–4; see Table I). The Xenopus 5 S RNA gene was again used as a standard for nucleosome affinity (Fig. 1B, lane 1). We conclude that within the DRPLA gene as few as 10 CTG repeats enhance nucleosome assembly and that further expansion of the number of CTG repeats to that found in disease states does not contribute to a direct increase in the efficiency of nucleosome assembly. We wished to understand the determinants of favored nucleosome assembly on DNA fragments containing CTG triplet repeats. We first examined the potential positioning of a nucleosome including a fragment of the Xenopus histone H4 gene containing CTG triplet repeats at high resolution. Rotational settings of DNA on the histone octamer within the reconstituted nucleosomes were examined using hydroxyl radical cleavage or DNase I digestion. A clear 10–11 bp repeat in hydroxyl radical cleavage is apparent over the intact histone H4 gene fragment following nucleosome reconstitution (Fig. 2, histone H4 gene, compare lanes 4 and 5). This is indicative of rotational positioning of DNA on the surface of the histone octamer. Although this periodicity is retained after deletion of the CTG sequence (Fig. 2, ΔCTG, lanes 4 and 5), it appears to be somewhat weaker in the construct in which both CTG and CGG repeats have been deleted (Fig. 2, ΔCTG/CGG, lanes 4 and 5; see Fig. 3, Fig. 4). DNase I digestions are consistent with hydroxyl radical cleavage patterns for naked and nucleosomal DNA (compare lane 2 with lane 3 for each of the constructs). Although the CTG repeats are rotationally positioned on the surface of the histone octamer this analysis does not reveal the CTG repeats as naked DNA to have any intrinsic structure that is detected by the hydroxyl radical (Fig. 2, histone H4 gene, lane 5). Moreover the CTG repeats are clearly not essential for the rotational positioning of this DNA sequence on the surface of the histone octamer.Fig. 3Densitometer tracings of Xenopus H4 gene footprints. Line graphs of the data contained in Fig. 2. 3′ and 5′ ends of the DNA strand are marked at the top of each group of tracings as is an open box representing the area of CTG repeats and a solid bar indicative of a region of intrinsically structured DNA.

A, data from Fig. 3 is plotted relative to the sequence of the histone H4 gene constructs used in hydroxyl radical footprinting of nucleosomal DNA. Dotted lines are drawn through the regions of maximal cleavage in the H4 gene in order to facilitate comparison.

B, rotational settings of CTG and CGG trinucleotide repeats found in a reconstituted nucleosome on the histone H4 gene. Histone contacts are also shown, using translational position data from Fig. 5. Histone contacts are derived from histone octamer crystal structure (see Pruss et al. (43Pruss D. Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 161-170Google Scholar), for details). Different core histones are marked at their amino- and carboxyl-terminal extension, a dotted line being an approximate position of a flexible tail not defined in the crystal structure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The DNase I and hydroxyl radical cleavage patterns due to the rotational positioning of DNA on the surface of the histone octamer were examined more closely (Fig. 3). The densitometer tracings clearly reveal the differential accessibilities of hydroxyl radical and DNase I to different regions of the wild type and mutant H4 gene fragments including the CTG repeats (Fig. 3A, open box). An interesting feature apparent on the tracings is a region of DNA structure within naked DNA falling to one side of the trinucleotide repeat boundaries (Fig. 3A, solid bar). This structural region spans an area that encompasses over four helical turns of DNA. The modulation in hydroxyl radical cleavage is consistent with variations in minor groove width (Hayes et al., 18Hayes J.J. Bashkin J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30 (a): 8434-8440Google Scholar), these variations are maintained and exaggerated following incorporation of this DNA segment into a nucleosome (Fig. 3A, compare Oct-DNA and Naked DNA tracings for hydroxyl radical cleavage). The presence of this element of intrinsic DNA structure may explain why even a deletion of both trinucleotide repeat sequences from the H4 gene does not entirely eliminate rotational positioning of DNA on the surface of the histone octamer (Fig. 3, B and C) and does not reduce the free energy of nucleosome formation to the level of bulk mononucleosomal DNA (see Fig. 1 and Table I). Although the segment of intrinsic structure is not as apparent in the scans of hydroxyl radical cleavage of the deletion mutants (Fig. 3, compare A with B and C), expansions of the scans reveal the modulations in hydroxyl radical cleavage to be maintained (not shown). However, the modulations of hydroxyl radical cleavage for nucleosomal DNA assembled using the deletion constructs are reduced relative to the cleavage patterns obtained with nucleosomes assembled using the intact histone H4 gene segment (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). DNase I and hydroxyl radical cleavage data have been aligned with the sequence of the histone H4 gene (Fig. 4). A DNA fragment derived from the native H4 gene and the same DNA in which the CTG repeats have been deleted organize DNA with nearly the same rotational phasing with respect to the histone surface, however, removal of both CTG and CGG repeats clearly alter the rotational frame of DNA with respect to the histone surface (Fig. 4A). The exact rotational positions of the individual bases in the repeat sequences within the intact histone H4 gene fragment are shown in the context of DNA wrapping on the nucleosome (Fig. 4B). Histone contacts have been included based on the translational positioning data discussed below (see Pruss et al., 43Pruss D. Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 161-170Google Scholar). The same triplet sequences are present both at sites where the minor groove is widened and where it is narrowed through the distortion of the double helix around the histone octamer (Morse and Simpson, 33Morse R.H. Simpson R.T. Cell. 1988; 54: 285-287Google Scholar). Our next experiments mapped the translational positions of nucleosomes reconstituted on the histone H4 gene. Translational position refers to exactly where DNA-histone contacts begin and end with respect to DNA sequence. This is a much more stringent test of the nucleosome positioning ability of a given sequence, since it is not uncommon for DNA sequences associated with genes to have a rotational preference with respect to the surface of the histone octamer within a nucleosome, but DNA sequences which lead to the assembly of a single translationally positioned nucleosome upon in vitro reconstitution are rare (Meersseman et al., 32Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bradbury E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 89-100Google Scholar; Wolffe, 56Wolffe A.P. Chromatin: Structure and Function. Academic Press,"
https://openalex.org/W2152920546,"Cellular DNA damage results in the increased expression and accumulation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein within the nucleus which leads to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. In some cases, however, wild-type p53 and some mutant forms of p53 reside in the cytoplasm of cancer cells. To understand the mechanism responsible for its cytoplasmic retention, studies were undertaken to determine if unique proteins form a complex with mutant p53 within the cytoplasm of transformed cells. One protein, with an apparent molecular mass of 92 kDa (p92), was observed to form a complex with a temperature-sensitive mutant p53 (TSp53Val-135) in the cytoplasm of transformed rat embryo fibroblasts at the non-permissive temperature. p92 copurified with TSp53Val-135 on a p53-specific immunoaffinity column and a gel filtration column. The protein was purified to homogeneity and identified as hsp84 by partial amino acid sequence analysis. hsp84 is a member of the hsp90 class of proteins. At the non-permissive temperature, TSp53Val-135 and hsp84 colocalized in the cytoplasm near the nuclear envelope. At the permissive temperature, TSp53Val-135 resides in the nucleus and expresses a “wild-type like” conformation. Under these conditions hsp84 continued to reside in the cytoplasm and little or no hsp84 formed a complex with p53. The results suggest that hsp84 binds mutant p53 in a spatial and/or conformation dependent manner.

They participate in agonist recognition and must interact, directly or indirectly, for proper receptor function. The thrombin receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by a novel proteolytic mechanism. Thrombin binds to and cleaves its receptor's amino-terminal exodomain to unmask a new amino terminus. This then functions as a tethered peptide ligand, binding intramolecularly to the body of the receptor to effect signaling (1Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Google Scholar, 2Vu T.-K.H. Wheaton V.I. Hung D.T. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 674-677Google Scholar, 3Chen J. Ishii M. Wang L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides that mimic the tethered ligand domains of the thrombin receptor behave as peptide agonists, activating the receptor independent of thrombin and receptor proteolysis (1Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Google Scholar, 4Scarborough R.M. Naughton M. Teng W. Hung D.T. Rose J. Vu T.-K.H. Wheaton V.I. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13146-13149Google Scholar). Identification of the interactions by which the tethered ligand domain of the thrombin receptor causes transmembrane signaling is critical for understanding signaling by this receptor and perhaps other members of the vast G protein-coupled receptor family. Such information may also foster the development of drugs that block the thrombotic, inflammatory, and proliferative actions of thrombin (5Fenton II, J.W. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1988; 14: 234-240Google Scholar, 6Coughlin S.R. Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 351-355Google Scholar). With the goal of identifying such docking interactions, we previously exploited the different agonist specificities of the human and Xenopus laevis thrombin receptors (7Gerszten R.E. Chen J. Ishii M. Ishii K. Wang L. Nanevicz T. Turck C.W. Vu T.-H.K. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1994; 368: 648-651Google Scholar, 8Nanevicz T. Ishii M. Wang L. Chen M. Chen J. Turck C.W. Cohen F. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21619-21625Google Scholar). The tethered ligand sequences in these receptors are distinct: SFLLRN in human and TFRIFD in Xenopus. Synthetic “agonist peptides” mimicking these sequences are selective for their respective receptors. A detailed analysis of gain-of-function human-Xenopus thrombin receptor chimeras suggested that Arg5 in the human agonist peptide is recognized by the Glu260 region in the second extracellular loop (ECL) of the receptor. Moreover, loss of function mutations at agonist position 5 could be complemented by mutations in the Glu260 region of the receptor, and specific mutations in the Glu260 region of the human receptor caused constitutive receptor activation (9Nanevicz T. Wang L. Chen M. Ishii M. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 702-706Google Scholar). These observations suggest a probable role for this receptor domain in agonist recognition and receptor activation. However, these studies focused on identifying receptor domains which distinguished between the human and Xenopus agonist peptides and could not address where important structures that are conserved between these agonists might dock. Recently, a second protease-activated receptor (PAR2) that is 30% identical to the thrombin receptor in its amino acid sequence was described (10Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Wahlestedt C. Sundelin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9208-9212Google Scholar, 11Nystedt S. Larsson A.K. Aberg H. Sundelin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5950-5955Google Scholar). Like the thrombin receptor, PAR2 is activated by limited proteolysis of its amino-terminal exodomain, and the synthetic peptide SLIGRL that mimics the newly created amino terminus is an agonist for PAR2 (10Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Wahlestedt C. Sundelin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9208-9212Google Scholar). The human-Xenopus chimera studies described above identified a probable recognition site for position 5 in the human thrombin receptor agonist peptide. Position 5 in the PAR2 and human thrombin receptor agonist peptides, SLIGRL and SFLLRN, is a conserved arginine. Glu260, the putative docking site for Arg5, is also conserved in these receptors. These observations suggested that PAR2-human thrombin receptor chimeras might be useful for identifying docking interactions not probed in the human-Xenopus chimera studies. We, therefore, investigated the specificity of the thrombin receptor and PAR2 for their respective agonists and exploited their different specificities with receptor chimeras. Our results suggest that thrombin receptor and PAR2 use similar strategies for agonist recognition in that ECL2 is a critical determinant of the specificity of both receptors. Our results also reveal a requirement for interactions among the extracellular domains of these receptors for proper receptor function. Thus, the extracellular domains of G protein-coupled receptors make important contributions to receptor structure and function and are not simply passive links between transmembrane domains. Murine PAR2 receptor cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription of mouse kidney mRNA followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification using primers based on the published cDNA sequence (11Nystedt S. Larsson A.K. Aberg H. Sundelin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5950-5955Google Scholar): primer N206, 5′-TTGAAGCTTTGTGCTCAGAGTAGGGCTCCGAGTTTCGA; and primer C776, 5′-CATCAAGCGGAATTCACATCCTCAGGTACAGCTCAGTA. The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into pBLOG (12Chen J. Bernstein H.S. Chen M. Wang L. Ishii M. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23398-23401Google Scholar), and its nucleotide sequence was obtained by dideoxy sequencing. Polymerase chain reaction-induced errors in the sequence were corrected to match the published sequence (11Nystedt S. Larsson A.K. Aberg H. Sundelin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5950-5955Google Scholar) using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (13Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Google Scholar, 14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding an epitope-tagged PAR2 was generated by introducing a sequence encoding the FLAG epitope (DYKDDD) after residue Thr25, i.e. just carboxyl to the putative signal peptidase site (15von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Google Scholar). Mutant receptor cDNAs were generated using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (13Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A.

A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). Specific constructs are described in Fig. 1. In the native thrombin receptor cDNA and all chimeric receptor cDNAs, the native thrombin receptor signal peptide was replaced by a prolactin signal peptide sequence, and a FLAG epitope (DYKDDD) sequence was inserted at the amino terminus of the mature receptor protein (17Ishii K. Hein L. Kobilka B. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9780-9786Google Scholar). The responses of wild-type and mutant receptors to agonist peptides were assayed in X. laevis oocytes as described (1Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Google Scholar, 7Gerszten R.E. Chen J. Ishii M. Ishii K. Wang L. Nanevicz T. Turck C.W. Vu T.-H.K. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1994; 368: 648-651Google Scholar, 18Williams J.A. McChesney D.J. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. Logsdon C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4939-4943Google Scholar). Briefly, cRNA was transcribed from wild-type or mutant receptors subcloned into pFROG (1Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Google Scholar) and from PAR2 subcloned into pBLOG. Oocytes were microinjected with cRNA encoding chimeric receptors or wild-type thrombin receptor at 12.5-25 ng/oocyte and cultured for 24 h. Receptor expression on the oocyte surface was measured as the binding of M1 monoclonal antibody (Kodak; Scientific Imaging Systems) to the FLAG epitope. The quantity of cRNA injected was adjusted to maintain chimeric receptor expression within 50–150% of the wild-type thrombin receptor control. Oocytes microinjected with 12.5-25 ng of wild-type PAR2 cRNA showed high basal signaling compared to oocytes microinjected with the same quantity of cRNA encoding wild-type thrombin receptor or any of the receptor chimeras tested. For this reason, only 0.25 ng of PAR2 cRNA was microinjected per oocyte. PAR2 surface expression under these conditions ranged from 5–20% of that of wild-type thrombin receptor, but agonist-stimulated responses were similar (see below). Oocytes were loaded with 45CaCl2, and agonist peptide-induced 45Ca release, a reflection of agonist-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis, was assayed as described previously (1Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Google Scholar, 18Williams J.A. McChesney D.J. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. Logsdon C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4939-4943Google Scholar). The agonist peptides SFLLRN and SLIGRL were synthesized in the carboxy amide form and purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography before use (4Scarborough R.M. Naughton M. Teng W. Hung D.T. Rose J. Vu T.-K.H. Wheaton V.I. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13146-13149Google Scholar). EC50 values for the activation of wild-type or mutant receptors by SFLLRN or SLIGRL were estimated from concentration-response curves generated with four or five concentrations of agonist up to a maximum of 300 or 1000 µM, respectively (7Gerszten R.E. Chen J. Ishii M. Ishii K. Wang L. Nanevicz T. Turck C.W. Vu T.-H.K. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1994; 368: 648-651Google Scholar, 8Nanevicz T. Ishii M. Wang L. Chen M. Chen J. Turck C.W. Cohen F. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21619-21625Google Scholar). A concentration-response curve for wild-type thrombin receptor response to SFLLRN and SLIGRL was run in parallel with curves for each mutant receptor in each experiment. Maximal response was defined as maximum agonist-stimulated fold increase in 45Ca release over basal for each construct. In this system, the maximal responses of thrombin receptor and PAR2 to their respective agonist peptides were similar, approximately 35–50 times baseline. Similarly, with the exception of ECL3 and ATE+2, all chimeric receptors tested mediated maximal responses to agonist peptide or thrombin that were within 80–120% of the maximal response of the wild-type thrombin receptor, allowing meaningful comparisons of their EC50 values. The loss of function in ECL3 and ATE+2 is discussed below. Thrombin receptor (1Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Google Scholar, 4Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9208-9212Google Scholar, 11Nystedt S. Larsson A.K. Aberg H. Sundelin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5950-5955Google Scholar) can be activated by peptides that mimic their respective tethered ligand domains, SFLLRN and SLIGRL. To determine the specificity of these receptors for their respective “agonist peptides,” thrombin receptor and PAR2 were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and their responses to SFLLRN and SLIGRL were determined. Marked differences in agonist specificities were noted. Oocytes expressing thrombin receptor showed robust responses to the thrombin receptor agonist peptide SFLLRN, but such oocytes were virtually unresponsive to the PAR2 agonist SLIGRL (Fig. 2a and Table I). By contrast, oocytes expressing PAR2 showed robust responses to both SLIGRL and SFLLRN (Fig. 2b and Table I). In addition to providing an approach for defining the structures responsible for agonist specificity, these results point out an important caution in interpreting responses to SFLLRN in cell lines or tissues. Such responses cannot be automatically attributed to thrombin receptor, given the ability of SFLLRN to activate PAR2.Table IActivation of thrombin receptor, PAR2, and chimeric receptors by thrombin receptor and PAR2 agonists: domains responsible for agonist specificity and evidence for exodomain interactionsTable IActivation of thrombin receptor, PAR2, and chimeric receptors by thrombin receptor and PAR2 agonists: domains responsible for agonist specificity and evidence for exodomain interactions To identify the receptor domains responsible for the differing agonist specificities of thrombin receptor and PAR2, we examined the ability of SLIGRL and SFLLRN to activate thrombin receptor-PAR2 chimeras. Because SLIGRL had little activity at the thrombin receptor, we built PAR2 domains into the thrombin receptor and looked for a gain of responsiveness to the PAR2 agonist. We first asked whether the differing specificities of PAR2 and thrombin receptor were a function of the exodomains or transmembrane segments of the receptor. A striking change in agonist specificity was conferred by replacing the ATE of the thrombin receptor and all three ECL with the cognate PAR2 sequences. This extracellular domain swap conferred more than a 35-fold increase in responsiveness to SLIGRL and an almost 8-fold decrease in responsiveness to SFLLRN (Fig. 2c and Table I). Thus, the extracellular faces of PAR2 and thrombin receptor appear to be responsible for distinguishing their respective agonists. To identify which extracellular domains conferred this remarkable switch in agonist specificity, we generated four chimeric receptors. In each, a single extracellular domain of the thrombin receptor was replaced by the cognate segment of PAR2 (Fig. 1). Replacement of the second ECL of the thrombin receptor was sufficient to confer a marked change in agonist specificity: a more than 10-fold gain of responsiveness to SLIGRL and an approximately 7-fold loss of responsiveness to SFLLRN (Table I). Thus, most of the change in agonist specificity accomplished by substituting the entire extracellular domain of PAR2 for the cognate thrombin receptor structure was accounted for by ECL2. This result is analogous to that obtained using human-Xenopus thrombin receptor chimeras and suggests that PAR2 and thrombin receptor use similar strategies for agonist recognition. Indeed, at least one possible agonist-receptor interaction may operate in both systems. The human-Xenopus thrombin receptor chimera studies suggested a possible interaction between Arg5 in SFLLRN and Glu260 in the second ECL of the human thrombin receptor (8Nanevicz T. Ishii M. Wang L. Chen M. Chen J. Turck C.W. Cohen F. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21619-21625Google Scholar). These amino acids are conserved in PAR2; thus, an Arg5-Glu260 interaction might also operate in recognition of SLIGRL by PAR2. However, the different specificities of thrombin receptor and PAR2 suggest that other direct or indirect interactions between agonist and ECL2 must be responsible for distinguishing the PAR2 and thrombin receptor agonists. Unlike the ECL2 substitution, the substitution of the ECL1 of PAR2 for the cognate thrombin receptor structure conferred a gain of responsiveness to both SLIGRL and SFLLRN (Table I). Thus, rather than changing agonist specificity, the ECL1 substitution caused a general change in signaling properties and was not informative. Surprisingly, the substitution of either ECL3 or ATE individually yielded a remarkable loss of receptor function (Table I), despite the fact that substitution of all PAR2 exodomains for the cognate thrombin receptor domains yielded a functional receptor with PAR2-like specificity. This result suggested that ECL3 and ATE must interact, directly or indirectly, with other extracellular domains or with each other to permit proper receptor function. Toward identifying such interactions, we attempted to complement the loss of function caused by the ECL3 or ATE substitutions by making pairwise substitutions of ECL3 or ATE with the other PAR2 exodomains. Strikingly, a chimeric receptor 3+ATE that contained both loss of function PAR2 extracellular domain substitutions was more responsive to agonist than the chimeras containing either substitution alone (Table I). Specifically, the chimeric receptor 3+ATE had an EC50 for activation by SFLLRN that was more than 5-fold lower than the chimera containing only ECL3 and 4-fold lower than the chimera containing only ATE. Consistent with this and more striking still, chimeric receptors containing the second ECL of PAR2 and either ATE or ECL3 were virtually nonfunctional, but chimeras which contained the second ECL of PAR2 and both ECL3 and ATE of PAR2 yielded a receptor with signaling properties similar to those of PAR2 itself (Table I). These data strongly suggest that a direct or indirect interaction of the ATE and ECL3 domains is required for receptor structure or function. Such an interaction may be simply at the level of structural compatibility, i.e. it is possible that ATE and ECL3 of PAR2 are simply incompatible with ECL3 and ATE of the thrombin receptor, respectively, and that substitution of both PAR2 exodomains merely removes such incompatibility. Alternatively, specific interactions between the ATE and ECL3 domains in each receptor may be required for receptor structure or function. Regardless, these receptors somehow recognize an appropriate pairing of ATE and ECL3 domains, and the most parsimonious model of how this might occur is via direct interaction of these domains. The three-dimensional structure of G protein-coupled receptors has not been solved at high resolution, and even the arrangement of the transmembrane helices with respect to one another is uncertain (19Schertler G.F. Villa C. Henderson R. Nature. 1993; 362: 770-772Google Scholar, 20Donnelly D. Findlay J.B.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 582-589Google Scholar). The results described above suggest that the ATE and third ECL of the thrombin receptor are in close proximity, which in turn suggests that transmembrane domain 1 must be near transmembrane domain 6 or 7. This arrangement is compatible with several current models of G protein-coupled receptor structure (19Schertler G.F. Villa C. Henderson R. Nature. 1993; 362: 770-772Google Scholar and 21Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Google Scholar; Fig. 3) and thus supports those models. Other recent experimental observations also support proximity of transmembrane domains 1 and 7 (22Mizobe T. Maze M. Lam V. Suryanarayana S. Kobilka B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2387-2389Google Scholar, 23Suryanarayana S. von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21991-21994Google Scholar). In summary, these studies report the specificity of the related protease-activated receptors PAR2 and thrombin receptor for their respective agonist peptides. The observation that PAR2 responded not only to its own agonist SLIGRL but also to thrombin receptor agonist peptide SFLLRN points up an important caution in interpreting responses of cells or tissues to SFLLRN. Such responses cannot be automatically attributed to the thrombin receptor. The observation that thrombin receptor failed to respond to the PAR2 agonist SLIGRL provided an opportunity to make gain-of-function chimeras to identify the receptor domains which distinguish the two agonists. These studies pointed to receptor ECL2 as a critical determinant of agonist specificity. This result is reminiscent of that obtained with human-Xenopus thrombin receptor chimeras and suggests that thrombin receptor and PAR2, perhaps not surprisingly, use a similar strategy for recognizing their respective agonist peptide domains. In this regard, the human-Xenopus chimeric receptor studies (7Gerszten R.E. Chen J. Ishii M. Ishii K. Wang L. Nanevicz T. Turck C.W. Vu T.-H.K. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1994; 368: 648-651Google Scholar, 8Nanevicz T. Ishii M. Wang L. Chen M. Chen J. Turck C.W. Cohen F. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21619-21625Google Scholar) suggested a possible docking interaction between an arginine at position 5 in the human agonist peptide SFLLRN and negatively charged residues, especially Glu260, in the second ECL of the human receptor. These residues are conserved in human thrombin receptor and PAR2; thus, it is possible that an Arg5-Glu260 interaction also occurs when SLIGRL docks with PAR2. However, given the gain of responsiveness to SLIGRL and decreased responsiveness to SFLLRN conferred by the substitution of the second ECL of PAR2 for the cognate thrombin receptor structure, the second ECL of these receptors must also specify distinct interactions with their respective agonists. Most interestingly, substitution of either ATE or third ECL of PAR2 for the cognate thrombin receptor domains caused loss of receptor function, but the corresponding double substitution permitted robust receptor function. This functional complementation was especially dramatic if the second ECL of PAR2 was included (see above). These observations demonstrate that the extracellular domains of these G protein-coupled receptors are more than simply passive links between transmembrane domains. They participate in agonist recognition and must interact, directly or indirectly, for proper receptor function. Because thrombin-induced platelet activation and mesenchymal cell proliferation may play important roles in vascular disease (24Coughlin S.R. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1993; 4: 77-83Google Scholar, 25Baykal D. Schmedtje J.J. Runge M.S. Am. J. Cardiol. 1995; 75: 82B-87BGoogle Scholar), the thrombin receptor has become a target for pharmaceutical development. The development of competitive antagonists for protease-activated receptors may prove difficult, given the irreversibility of the proteolytic activation mechanism and the proximity of tethered ligand and docking sites (17Ishii K. Hein L. Kobilka B. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9780-9786Google Scholar). However, the studies described above suggest that non-competitive antagonists might be developed as drugs that disrupt interactions among the extracellular domains of the receptor that are critical for receptor function. a portion of the amino-terminal exodomain (see Fig. 1) extracellular loop(s) proteinase-activated receptor type 2."

Although much is known about the structure and function of Cα, few studies have addressed the possibility of a distinct role for the Cβ proteins. The present study is a detailed comparison of the biochemical properties of these two isoforms, which were initially expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Cβ1 demonstrated higher Km values for some peptide substrates than did Cα, but Cβ1 was insensitive to substrate inhibition, a phenomenon that was observed with Cα at substrate concentrations above 100 µM. Cα and Cβ1 displayed distinct IC50 values for the α and β isoforms of the protein kinase inhibitor, protein kinase inhibitor (5Huang Y.-Y. Kandel E.R. Varshavsky L. Brandon E.P. Qi M. Idzerda R.L.

Occupation of the cyclic nucleotide binding sites of the R subunits by cAMP results in relief of R subunit inhibition of the C subunits and dissociation of the holoenzyme complex. The dissociated, active C subunit can then affect the cell physiology via phosphorylation of a wide variety of protein substrates (1Krebs E.G. Beavo J.A. Annu. Rev.

One possible explanation for the diversity of cellular responses to cAMP is the presence of multiple isoforms of cAK. Three C and four R mammalian subunit isoforms have been described to date: Cα, Cβ, Cγ, RIα, RIβ, RIIα, and RIIβ. Splice variants of the prototypic Cβ protein (Cβ1) also have been reported, giving rise to Cβ2 and Cβ3 isoforms (4Wiemann S. Kinzel V. Pyerin W. J. Biol.

Cα and Cβ1 have been cloned from numerous sources (6Uhler M.D. Carmichael D.F. Lee D.C. Chrivia J.C. Krebs E.G. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Jahnsen T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 465-475Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of Cα and Cβ1 within a given species are 91% identical (7Uhler M.D. Chrivia J.C. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15360-15363Google Scholar); however, the amino acid identity of Cα proteins from different species is significantly greater (98–100%) (7Uhler M.D. Chrivia J.C. McKnight G.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 15202-15207Google Scholar), suggesting that each kinase plays a distinct role(s) in cellular regulation (7Uhler M.D. Chrivia J.C. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15360-15363Google Scholar, 12Olsen S.R. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18662-18666Google Scholar). Furthermore, Cα is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues, whereas Cβ1 is most highly expressed in brain and reproductive tissues (7Uhler M.D. Chrivia J.C. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15360-15363Google Scholar, 13Cadd G. McKnight G.S. Neuron. 1989; 3: 71-79Google Scholar). Despite these differences, no biochemical property specific to either C subunit isoform has been detected to date. The four R subunit isoforms also have been cloned and shown to possess different tissue distributions (13Cadd G. McKnight G.S. Neuron. 1989; 3: 71-79Google Scholar, 14Clegg C.H. Cadd G.G.

Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12352-12361Google Scholar). In addition, the RII isoforms but not the RI isoforms can be tethered within the cell via interactions with cAK anchoring proteins (17Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Google Scholar, 18Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Google Scholar). The resulting localization of type II holoenzymes to subcellular compartments may provide a means for selectively activating the type II cAK or influencing substrate availability (18Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Google Scholar, 19Rosenmund C. Carr D.W. Bergeson S.E. Nilaver G. Scott J.D. Westbrook G.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 853-855Google Scholar). Unlike the C subunit isoforms, intrinsic differences between the R subunits have been shown to confer distinct biochemical properties upon holoenzymes. For example, whereas each RI isoform has an alanine at the phosphoacceptor site in the pseudosubstrate sequence, the RII isoforms have a phosphorylatable serine or threonine at this position (20Doskeland S.O. Maronde E. Gjertsen B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 249-258Google Scholar). Furthermore, cAK holoenzymes containing RIβ demonstrated a decreased (3–7-fold) Ka value for cAMP when compared with holoenzymes formed with RIα (21Cadd G.G. Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19502-19506Google Scholar, 22Solberg R. Tasken K. Wen W. Coghlan V.M. Meinkoth J.L. Scott J.D. Jahnsen T. Taylor S.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 595-605Google Scholar). The increased cAMP sensitivity of type Iβ holoenzymes offered a biochemical basis for the functional effects observed in mice that selectively lacked RIβ (23Brandon E.P. Zhuo M. Huang Y.-Y. Qi M. Gerhold K.A. Burton K.A. Kandel E.R. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8851-8855Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the gene encoding RIβ in mice resulted in severe defects in hippocampal long term depression and depotentiation at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses (23Brandon E.P. Zhuo M. Huang Y.-Y. Qi M. Gerhold K.A. Burton K.A. Kandel E.R. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1211-1222Google Scholar). These effects were observed despite a compensatory increase in hippocampal RIα, suggesting that holoenzymes with increased cAMP sensitivity may be required for discrete physiological functions (5Huang Y.-Y. Kandel E.R. Varshavsky L. Brandon E.P. Qi M. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Bourtchouladze R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1211-1222Google Scholar, 23Brandon E.P. Zhuo M. Huang Y.-Y. Qi M. Gerhold K.A. Burton K.A. Kandel E.R. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8851-8855Google Scholar). Recent data generated from Cβ1 knockout mice have provided the first evidence that Cβ1 serves an in vivo function distinct from Cα (5Huang Y.-Y. Kandel E.R. Varshavsky L. Brandon E.P. Qi M. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Bourtchouladze R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1211-1222Google Scholar, 24Qi M. Zhuo M. Skalhegg B.S. Brandon E.P. Kandel E.R. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1571-1576Google Scholar). The Cβ1-deficient mice had unaltered total brain kinase activity yet lacked both long term depression and depotentiation and showed significant decreases in the late phase of long term potentiation at hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. In addition, mossy fiber long term potentiation was essentially abolished. The phenotypic similarities between the RIβ and Cβ1 mutant mice are striking and may reflect a common biochemical property of holoenzymes possessing either of these subunit isoforms. To determine whether catalytic or regulatory differences exist between Cα and Cβ1, we expressed the two proteins in Escherichia coli, purified them, and compared their affinities for nucleotide, substrate, and inhibitors. In addition, holoenzymes formed with recombinant RIIα and Cα or Cβ1 were purified by gel filtration, and Ka values for cAMP were obtained. We chose to investigate the type II holoenzyme because an earlier study showed no difference in Ka(cAMP) values for type I holoenzymes containing Cα or Cβ1 (21Cadd G.G. Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19502-19506Google Scholar). Significant differences between RIIα2Cα2 and RIIα2Cβ12 revealed by in vitro experiments were then confirmed in an in vivo transfection system. The results show that Cα and Cβ1 have distinct enzymatic properties. Furthermore, Cβ1, like RIβ, can increase holoenzyme cAMP sensitivity, most likely through novel R-C interactions distal to the catalytic site. Together, this work comprises the first detailed comparison of the Cα and Cβ isoforms and demonstrates the first biochemical differences between the two isoforms. Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside, restriction enzymes, and DNA-modifying enzymes were from Life Technologies, Inc. PKIα(5–24) (Thr-Thr-Tyr-Ala-Asp-Phe-Ile-Ala-Ser-Gly-Arg-Thr-Gly-Arg-Arg-Asn-Ala-Ile-His-Asp) and Kemptide (Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly) were from Bachem (Torrance, CA), and CREBtide (Lys-Arg-Arg-Glu-Ile-Leu-Ser-Arg-Arg-Pro-Ser-Tyr-Arg) and IP3Rtide (Gly-Arg-Arg-Glu-Ser-Leu-Thr-Ser-Phe-Gly) were from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Radiochemicals were purchased from ICN. All other chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. pET9d (Novagen) was digested with BamHI and filled in using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase. The treated pET9d vector was digested further with NcoI and isolated. Next, the vector pMTCβ1(G1A) (25Huggenvik J.I. Collard M.W. Stofko R.E. Seasholtz A.F. Uhler M.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 921-930Google Scholar) was digested with NcoI and SspI, yielding a 1210-base pair Cβ1 cDNA fragment, which was isolated and ligated into the prepared pET9d vector. The resulting plasmid, pET9d.Cβ1(G1A), was sequenced using the dideoxy termination procedure to ensure that the open reading frame was intact (26Sanger F. Coulson A.R. Barrell B.G. Smith A.J.A. Roe B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 161-178Google Scholar). The pET9d.Cβ1(G1A) plasmid was electroporated into E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS in order to express the Cβ1 protein. The E. coli cultures containing the Cβ1 expression plasmid were grown and induced as described previously (27Baude E.J. Dignam S.S. Olsen S.R. Reimann E.M. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2316-2323Google Scholar). Using carboxymethyl-Sepharose and gel filtration chromatography (27Baude E.J. Dignam S.S. Olsen S.R. Reimann E.M. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2316-2323Google Scholar), the Cβ1 protein was purified to homogeneity as determined by silver staining (28Merril C.R. Goldman D. Van Keuren M.L. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 104: 441-447Google Scholar) of SDS-PAGE gels (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The purification of Cα is described elsewhere (27Baude E.J. Dignam S.S. Olsen S.R. Reimann E.M. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2316-2323Google Scholar). The purified C subunits (3 nM) were assayed for phosphotransferase activity (11Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15202-15207Google Scholar) using Kemptide (30Kemp B.E. Graves D.J. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4888-4894Google Scholar), CREBtide (31Colbran J.L. Roach P.J. Fiol C.J. Dixon J.E. Andrisani O.M. Corbin J.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 1277-1282Google Scholar), or IP3Rtide (32Komalavilas P. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8701-8707Google Scholar) as the phosphoacceptor peptides. The apparent Km values for the peptides were measured using 200 µM ATP and varying peptide concentrations, whereas the apparent Km values for ATP were ascertained by varying the ATP concentration in the presence of 100 µM Kemptide. The remaining components of the phosphotransferase assay mix were as described (11Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15202-15207Google Scholar). One unit in these experiments is defined as 1 µmol of phosphate transferred to the peptide substrate per min at 30°C. The apparent Michaelis constants for the peptide substrates and for ATP were graphically determined by double reciprocal plots of the primary data (33Lineweaver H. Burk D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-666Google Scholar). C subunits (50 pM) were incubated for 10 min in the presence of increasing concentrations of PKIα(5–24), MBP-PKIα (27Baude E.J. Dignam S.S. Olsen S.R. Reimann E.M. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2316-2323Google Scholar), or MBP-PKIβ1 (27Baude E.J. Dignam S.S. Olsen S.R. Reimann E.M. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2316-2323Google Scholar) in the phosphotransferase assay mix (11Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15202-15207Google Scholar). MBP-PKIα and MBP-PKIβ1 are fusion proteins between the E. coli MBP and the coding regions of human PKIα or mouse PKIβ1. MBP has been shown to have no effect on the inhibitory activity of PKI (34Gamm D.M. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7227-7232Google Scholar). After the preincubation, Kemptide was added to a final concentration of 100 µM to initiate the assay. The reaction was terminated after a 2-h incubation at 30°C. Control activities were 7.4 units/mg for Cα and 7.3 units/mg for Cβ1. The titrations of RIIα activity were determined as before (35Baude E.J. Dignam S.S. Reimann E.M. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18128-18133Google Scholar) with the modification of using 100 µM Kemptide in the assay. The C subunit concentration in the assay was 50 pM. RIIα2Cα2 and RIIα2Cβ12 holoenzymes were formed and purified by gel filtration as described by Yang et al. (36Yang S. Fletcher W.H. Johnson D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6267-6271Google Scholar) using 8 µg of purified RIIα and a 2-fold excess of either purified Cα or Cβ1. Under these conditions, holoenzyme was formed equally well in the presence or the absence of 4 mM ATP and 6 mM magnesium acetate. Maximal cAMP-dependent kinase activity eluted from a Sephacryl S-200 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at the same volume for both Cα- and Cβ1-containing type II holoenzyme. Peak cAMP-independent kinase activity, representing free C subunit, eluted at a significantly higher and identical volume for Cα and Cβ1. Purified RIIα2Cα2 and RIIα2Cβ12 were assayed separately in the presence of 200 µM ATP, 11 nM [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 200 cpm/pmol), magnesium acetate (10 mM), Kemptide (30 or 100 µM), and varying concentrations of cAMP. Holoenzymes were formed and purified immediately prior to each assay, and the amount of purified holoenzyme used in these experiments (2 µl of a 1-ml fraction) was within the linear range of the assays. The reaction was terminated after 30 min, and radioactivity incorporated into Kemptide was determined by scintillation counting. The Ka value for cAMP is defined as the concentration of cAMP required to achieve one-half the Vmax value. Control activities for RIIα2Cα2 and RIIα2Cβ12 were 5.0 and 4.2 units/ml, respectively. The plasmid pCMV.RIIα was constructed by subcloning the RIIα cDNA insert from pET16b.RIIα (35Baude E.J. Dignam S.S. Reimann E.M. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18128-18133Google Scholar) into the BglII site of pCMV.Neo (25Huggenvik J.I. Collard M.W. Stofko R.E. Seasholtz A.F. Uhler M.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 921-930Google Scholar). The pCMV.Cα, pCMV.Cβ1, and pSV2.βgal expression vectors have been described previously (25Huggenvik J.I. Collard M.W. Stofko R.E. Seasholtz A.F. Uhler M.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 921-930Google Scholar). The human chorionic gonadotropin-luciferase expression vector used as a cAMP-responsive reporter (37Mellon P.L. Clegg C.H. Correll L.A. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4887-4891Google Scholar) was a gift of Dr. Stan McKnight (University of Washington). COS-1 cells were transfected at 20% confluency on 10-cm plates with a total of 30 µg of plasmid DNA using the calcium phosphate method (38Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). The experiments shown used 6 µg of pCMV.Cα or pCMV.Cβ1, 0.5 µg of human chorionic gonadotropin-luciferase, 2.0 µg of pSV2.βgal, and the indicated amounts of pCMV.RIIα. The total amount of plasmid DNA transfected was always brought to 30 µg with the parental pCMV.Neo plasmid. 24 h after transfection the cells were washed and treated with forskolin or 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP for another 24 h before harvesting. Extracts were prepared by sonicating the cells in 500 µl of a 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 1 mM dithiothreitol, after which the extracts were assayed for β-galactosidase and luciferase activities as described (39Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 9.7.12Google Scholar). In an earlier study, the α and β1 isoforms of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase were purified from stably transfected cell lines (12Olsen S.R. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18662-18666Google Scholar). The purification process, however, yielded only microgram amounts of protein, and the Vmax values (12Olsen S.R. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18662-18666Google Scholar) were lower than other published reports (30Kemp B.E. Graves D.J. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4888-4894Google Scholar, 40Whitehouse S. Feramisco J.R. Casnellie J.E. Krebs E.G. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3693-3701Google Scholar). In order to investigate whether the C subunit isoforms have unique properties, we took advantage of a system already used to express and purify Cα from E. coli to obtain large amounts of soluble Cα and Cβ1 for biochemical characterization (41Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20940-20946Google Scholar, 42Yonemoto W.M. McGlone M.L. Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 581-596Google Scholar). Murine Cβ1 was expressed in E. coli and purified using ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”) (27Baude E.J. Dignam S.S. Olsen S.R. Reimann E.M. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2316-2323Google Scholar). In a previous report, the expression of Cβ1 at 37°C in the bacterial host strain BL21(DE3) resulted in mostly insoluble protein (43Gosse M.E. Fleischmann R. Marshall M. Wang N. Garges S. Gottesman M.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 79-85Google Scholar). However, this was not observed when Cβ1 was produced at room temperature in BL21(DE3)/pLysS bacteria, an E. coli strain that allowed minimal promoter leakage (see “Experimental Procedures”). Also, the expression of Cα at room temperature resulted in significantly more soluble C subunit than when cultures were grown at 37°C (41Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20940-20946Google Scholar, 42Yonemoto W.M. McGlone M.L. Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 581-596Google Scholar). The purified, soluble Cβ1 migrates slower than Cα during SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). This migration difference also was observed in immunoblots of Cα and Cβ1 from stably expressed cell lines using C subunit antibodies (11Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15202-15207Google Scholar) and with pure preparations of Cα and Cβ1 (12Olsen S.R. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18662-18666Google Scholar). The calculated Mr of unmodified Cβ1(G1A) (40,590 Da) is only 122 Da larger than Cα(G1A) (40,468 Da), a difference that should not be detectable under most conditions of SDS-PAGE. Because the C subunits are phosphoproteins, it was possible that the slower migration of Cβ1 was due to differential phosphorylation. However, phosphoamino acid analysis did not reveal any difference in phosphothreonine or phosphoserine levels between Cα and Cβ1 (data not shown), and the phosphorylation of Cα was similar to that reported previously (27Baude E.J. Dignam S.S. Olsen S.R. Reimann E.M. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2316-2323Google Scholar). To determine if Cβ1 purified from E. coli is kinetically competent and to assess whether Cβ1 and Cα have different affinities for substrate, the apparent Michaelis constants were determined for various peptide substrates and for ATP. The peptides used in these experiments were derived from cAK phosphorylation sites in pyruvate kinase (Kemptide, LRRALG) (30Kemp B.E. Graves D.J. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4888-4894Google Scholar), the cAMP response element binding protein (CREBtide, KRREILSRRPYR) (31Colbran J.L. Roach P.J. Fiol C.J. Dixon J.E. Andrisani O.M. Corbin J.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 1277-1282Google Scholar), or the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3Rtide, GRRELTSFG) (32Komalavilas P. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8701-8707Google Scholar). The Km values of Cα for Kemptide and IP3Rtide are 2.4- and 5.0-fold lower than those of Cβ1, respectively, whereas the Km values of the two isoforms for CREBtide are not statistically different (Fig. 2A and Table I). The Vmax value of Cα for IP3Rtide is slightly (1.7-fold) higher than that of Cβ1, although the Vmax values of Cα and Cβ1 for Kemptide and CREBtide are essentially identical (Fig. 2A and Table I). These results raise the possibility that Cα and Cβ1 may exhibit distinct but subtle substrate selectivities.Table IApparent kinetic constants of recombinant Cα and Cβ1 for peptide substrates and ATPC subunit isoformKmVmaxKemptideCREBitheIP3RtideATPKemptideCREBtideIP3RtideATPµmµmol/min·mgCα14.0 ± 4.111.7 ± 2.98.0 ± 2.641.7 ± 16.16.7 ± 3.08.4 ± 1.65.7 ± 1.09.1 ± 2.7Cβ133.5 ± 12.713.3 ± 2.940.0 ± 10.044.7 ± 9.97.7 ± 1.38.1 ± 1.03.4 ±"

The open reading frame of the mRNA contains 10 UGAs that presumably code for selenocysteine residues. Using heparin-Sepharose, we isolated two of the protein forms from immunoaffinity-purified selenoprotein P. One of the forms, Se-P45B, migrates at 45 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the other, Se-P57B, migrates at 57 kDa. These two forms were cleaved with cyanogen bromide, and both yielded 40-kDa fragments that were consistent with those fragments being an inter-methionine peptide near the N terminus of the predicted polypeptide. A 20-kDa fragment present in the cleavage products of Se-P57B was absent from the products of Se-P45B. This result suggested that Se-P45B lacks the C-terminal region of the predicted polypeptide. Carboxypeptidase P digestion of Se-P45B indicated that its C-terminal amino acid is Ser244, the amino acid immediately upstream from the predicted second selenocysteine. C-terminal analysis of Se-P57B indicated that its final residue is Asn366, the last amino acid predicted by the cDNA sequence. Amino acid composition analyses of the two forms were consistent with both arising from the same mRNA. Immunoaffinity-purified selenoprotein P was digested with proteases, and the resulting peptides were separated and sequenced. Only amino acid sequences predicted by the cDNA were found, and 80% of the predicted amino acid sequence was confirmed. These results are compatible with Se-P45B arising from termination of translation at the second in-frame UGA codon and all of the 10 in-frame UGA codons being read through to produce Se-P57B. These findings demonstrate that selenoprotein P isoforms of differing peptide lengths are present in plasma.

We now show that ceruloplasmin also increases LDL oxidation by vascular cells. In metal ion-free medium, human ceruloplasmin increased bovine aortic SMC- and EC-mediated LDL oxidation by up to 30- and 15-fold, respectively. The maximal response was at 100–300 µg ceruloplasmin/ml, a level at or below the unevoked physiological plasma concentration.

Three lines of evidence indicated a critical role for cellular superoxide (O2) in ceruloplasmin-stimulated oxidation. First, the rate of production of O2 by cells correlated with their rates of LDL oxidation. Second, superoxide dismutase effectively blocked ceruloplasmin-stimulated oxidation by both cell types. Finally, O2 production by SMC quantitatively accounted for the observed rate of LDL oxidation. To show this, the course of O2 production by SMC was simulated by repeated addition of xanthine and xanthine oxidase to culture medium under cell-free conditions.

Here, we have analyzed the relationship between ganglioside synthesis and the development of axons and dendrites in polarized neurons, using hippocampal neurons cultured in such a way that axons and dendrites are generated by a defined sequence of events and in which there is virtually no contamination by glial cells. Neurons were labeled with [4,5-3H]dihydrosphingosine, which was rapidly incorporated into cells and metabolized to 3H-labeled glycosphingolipids. The rate of 3H-labeled glycosphingolipid synthesis was directly proportional to the initial rate of [4,5-3H]dihydrosphingosine uptake and was linear versus time for up to 9 h of incubation. The major changes in 3H-labeled ganglioside synthesis occurred during the period of axonogenesis and rapid axon growth. During axonogenesis, there was a significant increase in the synthesis of complex gangliosides (i.e. GM1, GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b) with a corresponding reduction in the synthesis of glucosylceramide and ganglioside GD3. During the stage of rapid axon growth, the ratio of a- to b-series gangliosides increased significantly. However, during dendritogenesis, dendrite growth, and synaptogenesis, there was little change in ganglioside synthesis, with a small and gradual increase in the ratio of a- to b-series gangliosides and an increase in the synthesis of gangliosides GD1a and GT1b.

We have previously shown that in cells irreversibly committed to DNA synthesis by FGF-1, approximately 15% of cell surface FGFR-1 traffics to a perinuclear locale as a structurally intact and functional tyrosine kinase (Prudovsky, I., Savion, N., Zhan, X., Friesel, R., Xu, J., Hou, J., McKeehan, W. L., and Maciag, T. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 31720-31724). In order to define the structural requirement for association of FGFR-1 with the nucleus, the expression and trafficking of FGFR-1 in FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β L6 myoblast transfectants was studied. Although FGFR-1α was expressed as p145 and p125 forms, FGFR-1β was expressed as p120 and p100 forms in the L6 myoblast transfectants. Tunicamycin and N-glyconase experiments suggest that these forms of FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β are the result of differential glycosylation. However, only the p145 form of FGFR-1α and the p120 form of FGFR-1β were able to bind FGF-1 and activate tyrosine phosphorylation. Pulse-chase analysis of FGFR-1 biosynthesis suggests that the p125 and p100 proteins are the precursor forms of p145 FGFR-1α and p120 FGFR-1β, respectively. Because ligand-chase analysis demonstrated that FGFR-1β L6 myoblast transfectants exhibited a reduced efficiency of nuclear translocation of exogenous FGF-1 when compared with FGFR-1α transfectants, the intracellular trafficking of the FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β isoforms was studied using an in vitro kinase assay to amplify immunoprecipitated FGFR-1.

Biochem. 1993; 62: 453-482Google Scholar). The ability of the FGF prototypes to initiate DNA synthesis requires the continual exposure of the target cell to exogenous FGF during the entire G1 phase of the cell cycle in vitro (5Zhan X. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9611-9620Google Scholar, 6Gualandris A. Urbinati C. Rusnati M. Ziche M. Presta M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 149-159Google Scholar). Throughout this period, receptor-mediated internalization of FGF-1 results in its partition between the nucleus and cytosol (5Zhan X. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9611-9620Google Scholar, 7Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.O. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Cell. 1994; 76: 1039-1051Google Scholar) including the perinuclear trafficking of FGFR-1 (8Prudovsky I. Savion N. Zhan X. Friesel R. Xu J. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31720-31724Google Scholar). fibroblast growth factor fibroblast growth factor receptor polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. In addition to the exogenous signaling pathway, there also appears to be an endogenous pathway for mediating the intracellular traffic of FGF-1, FGF-2, and FGF-3 (9Jans D.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 841-847Google Scholar, 10Moroianu J. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12535-12539Google Scholar). Indeed, sequences responsible for nuclear localization have been characterized in FGF-1 (7Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.O. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4126-4136Google Scholar). Interestingly, a nucleolar localization sequence has recently been characterized in FGF-3 as an endogenous protein (17Kiefer P. Dickson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4364-4374Google Scholar) and the intranuclear trafficking of FGF-1, 2J. Shi, S. Friedman, and T. Maciag, unpublished observation. FGF-2 (18Quarto N. Talarico D. Florkiewicz R.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4364-4374Google Scholar) as endogenous intracellular proteins have been correlated with a decrease in proliferation potential in vitro. In addition, the nuclear trafficking of endogenous FGF-2 (19Bugler B. Amalric F. Prats H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 573-577Google Scholar, 20Florkiewicz R.Z. Sommer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Peters G. Dickson C. Nature. 1990; 343: 662-665Google Scholar) but not FGF-1 appears to be further complicated by the presence of alternative 5′-CUG translational start sites. In contrast, however, the biological significance of the nuclear trafficking properties of exogenous FGF is not clear, although the internalization of exogenous FGFs is receptor-dependent and correlates with an increased proliferative potential in vitro (1Burgess W.H.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12535-12539Google Scholar). Indeed, the forced secretion of the FGF prototypes yields either a prominent transformed phenotype in vitro (24Forough R. Zhan X. MacPhee M. Friedman S. Engleka K.A. Sayers T. Wiltrout R.H. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2960-2968Google Scholar) or exaggerated hyperplasia in vivo (25Nabel E.G. Yang Z.-Y. Plautz G. Forough R. Zhan X.

Development. 1995; 121: 505-514Google Scholar), and many of the signal peptide-containing FGF gene family members have been characterized as oncogenes (2Mason I.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 547-552Google Scholar, 3Friesel R.E. Maciag T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 919-925Google Scholar). It therefore appears that there may be distinct intracellular trafficking pathways for endogenous and exogenous FGFs that lead to different cellular phenotypes, which are dependent upon the ability of the ligand to interact with its receptor. The expression of the FGFR genes as translation products is regulated by alternative splicing (27Chellaiah A.T. McEwen D.G. Werner S. Xu J. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11620-11627Google Scholar, 28Cheon H.-G. Larochelle W.J. Bottaro D.P. Burgess W.H. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 989-993Google Scholar, 29Hou J.Z. Kan M.K.

Lu J. Chen H. Werner S. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4627-4634Google Scholar), and the two isoforms of FGFR-1 serve as an example. FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β have been characterized as containing three and two Ig-like structures in the amino-terminal ectodomain of their translation products (29Hou J.Z. Kan M.K. McKeehan K. McBride G. Adams P. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1991; 251: 665-668Google Scholar, 30Johnson D.E. Lee P.L. Lu J. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4728-4736Google Scholar, 31Johnson D.E. Lu J. Chen H. Werner S. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4627-4634Google Scholar). The differential expression of the FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β isoforms may be biologically significant because it has recently been shown that malignant astrocytomas express both forms of FGFR-1, whereas normal fetal and adult brain express only FGFR-1α (32Yamaguchi F. Saya H. Bruner J.M. Morrison R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 484-488Google Scholar). Further, similar FGFR-2α and β isoforms are differentially expressed during amphibian development (33Shi D-L. Launay C. Fromentoux V. Feige J.-J. Boucaut J.-C. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 173-182Google Scholar), and it has been demonstrated that the FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β isoforms exhibit different affinities for ligand and heparin (34Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Google Scholar, 35Zimmer Y. Givol D. Yayon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7899-7903Google Scholar). We have shown that FGFR-1 is translocated to a perinuclear locale as a structurally intact and functional tyrosine kinase during the G1 transition period in NIH 3T3 cells in vitro (8Prudovsky I. Savion N. Zhan X. Friesel R. Xu J. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31720-31724Google Scholar). Because ligand-induced FGFR-1 trafficking may be a component of the FGF-1 signaling pathway, we compared the intracellular trafficking of the FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β isoforms using stable L6 myoblast transfectants and report that unlike the perinuclear association of FGFR-1α, FGFR-1β does not traffic to a perinuclear locale. L6 myoblasts (a gift from Dr. Lewis Williams, University of California-San Francisco) were grown in DMEM supplemented with either 10% (v/v) bovine serum or 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and were density arrested in DMEM containing 0.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum for 18 h. Quiescent cells were stimulated with 40 ng/ml of recombinant human FGF-1 expressed and purified as described previously (11Imamura T. Engleka K. Zhan X. Tokita Y. Forough R. Roeder D. Jackson A. Maier J.A.M. Hla T. Maciag T. Science. 1990; 249: 1567-1570Google Scholar) in the presence of heparin (10 µg/ml). L6 myoblasts were transfected with expression constructs encoding FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β. The cDNA encoding human FGFR-1 with the two Ig-like disulfide loops, pZip-FGFR-1 (29Hou J.Z. Kan M.K. McKeehan K. McBride G. Adams P. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1991; 251: 665-668Google Scholar), was digested with BamHI and inserted into the pMEXneo plasmid under the control of the murine sarcoma virus LTR (36Martin-Zanca D. Oskam R. Mitra G. Copeland T. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 24-33Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the human three Ig-like disulfide loop form of FGFR-1 in a pBluescript SK plasmid was digested with BamHI and inserted into the pMEXneo plasmid. Cell transfection was performed using calcium phosphate according to the recommended protocol from Stratagene. Rabbit antiserum recognizing a carboxyl-terminal sequence in FGFR-1 was prepared against a synthetic peptide based on residues 764–776 of the deduced amino acid sequence of Xenopus FGFR-1 (FR-1) as described (37Friesel R. Dawid I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2481-2488Google Scholar). The FGFR-1α-specific monoclonal antibody M2F12 was raised against the bacterially expressed extracellular domain of the 50-kDa FGFR-1 three Ig-like disulfide loop antigen with a recognition domain on the first Ig loop (residues 50–79) as described (38Xu J. Nakahara M. Crabb J.W. Shi E. Matuo Y. Fraser M. Kan M. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17792-17803Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-vinculin antibodies (Sigma, V-4505) were used for immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, containing 300 mM sucrose, 60 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM sodium vanadate (nuclear preparation buffer), and the cytosolic fraction and nuclear pellet were prepared as described (8Prudovsky I. Savion N. Zhan X. Friesel R. Xu J. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31720-31724Google Scholar). The purity of nuclear preparations was determined by the presence of less than 2% acid phosphatase activity in the nuclear fraction of the total cell lysate activity. Transmission electron microscopic analysis also demonstrated the absence of cytoplasmic membranes and organelles in the nuclear fraction. The nuclei were solubilized in 0.25 ml of nuclear preparation buffer containing 0.4% (w/v) SDS, 1 mM MgCl2, and 10 units DNase 1 (Promega) for 3 min at 4°C followed by the addition of 0.75 ml of nuclear preparation buffer. The nuclear extract was incubated at 37°C for 5 min and at room temperature for an additional 10 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. In experiments with the antibody M2F12, the nuclei were solubilized by ultrasonication (10 pulses, 0.5 s each) in 1 ml of nuclear preparation buffer because SDS prevents the binding of M2F12 to FGFR-1α. Aliquots of the nuclear and cytosolic fractions (0.5 ml each) were immunoprecipitated with the appropriate anti-FGFR-1 antibody as described previously (5Zhan X. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9611-9620Google Scholar). The various FGFR-1·;antibody complexes were precipitated using Protein A-Sepharose beads and washed, and the in vitro kinase reaction was initiated by the incubation of the precipitates with 10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (8Prudovsky I. Savion N. Zhan X. Friesel R. Xu J. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31720-31724Google Scholar). [125I]FGF-1 was prepared as described previously (8Prudovsky I. Savion N. Zhan X. Friesel R. Xu J. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31720-31724Google Scholar). Transfected L6 cells in 100-mm diameter dishes were incubated for 20 min at 22°C with 4 ml of binding buffer containing 10 ng of [125I]FGF-1/ml in the presence or the absence of 1 µg of unlabeled FGF-1/ml as described (39Friesel R. Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1857-1865Google Scholar). Cells were transferred to 37°C for 5 min and then rapidly washed at 37°C in phosphate-buffered saline and disuccinimidyl suberate added to a final concentration of 0.3 mM. Dishes were incubated for an additional 15 min at 37°C and then rapidly washed as described (39Friesel R. Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1857-1865Google Scholar). Cell lysates were analyzed by 7.5% (w/v) SDS-PAGE and prepared for autoradiography. Cell lysates from L6 myoblast FGFR-1 transfectants were resolved by 7.5% (w/v) SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The filters were processed with either the affinity-purified anti-FGFR-1 carboxyl-terminal antibody (FR-1) or a monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) as described previously (5Zhan X. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9611-9620Google Scholar). Transfected L6 myoblasts were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in methionine-free DMEM for 20 min, after which [35S]methionine was added for 30 min followed by the addition of an excess of cold methionine (in DMEM) for the specified times. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitation performed as described above. Ligand-chase analysis was used to assess the kinetics of [125I]FGF-1 nuclear trafficking and was performed as described previously (5Zhan X. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9611-9620Google Scholar, 12Friedman S. Zhan X. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 1203-1208Google Scholar). Briefly, serum-starved (48 h in DMEM containing 10 µg/ml of insulin and 10 µg/ml of transferrin) FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β L6 myoblast transfectants were exposed to 10 ng/ml of cold FGF-1 and 10 units/ml of heparin for various periods of time; the cells were washed with 10 µg/ml of heparin and exposed to [125I]FGF-1 (5 ng/ml) for 2 h after which cytosol; and nuclear fractions were obtained. The intracellular content of [125I]FGF-1 was analyzed by 15% (w/v) SDS-PAGE, and cells maintained at 4°C served as a negative control (5Zhan X. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9611-9620Google Scholar). Serum-starved and FGF-1-stimulated FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β L6 myoblast transfectants were grown on coverslips, fixed for 3 min in acetone (−80°C), air-dried, incubated for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Buffer A), and incubated with anti-vinculin monoclonal AB (Sigma) for 1 h in Buffer A. The coverslips were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 1 h with fluorescein-conjugated goat-anti-mouse Ig, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and mounted in 50% (v/v) glycerol on microscope slides. Microscopy was performed with an Olympus fluorescent microscope. Stable L6 myoblast FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β transfectants were obtained, and all exhibited a significant increase in DNA synthesis in response to either 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum or 10 ng/ml of FGF-1 in vitro (data not shown). The L6 myoblast FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β transfectants were also unable to form myotubes at high cell density, a characteristic of the parental cell line (40Yaffe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 477-483Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of lysates from the L6 myoblast FGFR-1α transfectants (Fig. 1A) using a FGFR-1 antibody directed against the carboxyl terminus of the protein (FR-1) revealed the presence of two polypeptides, p145 and p125, that were not detected in lysates derived from the nontransfected L6 myoblast controls. Immunoblot analysis of lysates from L6 myoblast FGFR-1β transfectants under similar conditions also revealed the presence of two polypeptides, p120 and p100 (Fig. 1A). Similar data were also obtained using NIH 3T3 cell transfectants (data not shown). Because the FR-1 antibody recognizes a common carboxyl-terminal domain between FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β, the multiple Mr forms of FGFR-1 expressed in L6 myoblast FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β transfectants are likely to represent different amino-terminal ectodomain FGFR-1 isoforms. In order to determine whether the various forms of the FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β translation products are able to associate with extracellular FGF-1, covalent [125I]FGF-1 cross-linking experiments were performed. We utilized L6 myoblast transfectants because the endogenous FGFR population is quite low in contrast with the FGFR population present on the surface of other cell lines such as the NIH 3T3 cell (5Zhan X. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9611-9620Google Scholar, 39Friesel R. Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1857-1865Google Scholar). Although attempts to covalently cross-link [125I]FGF-1 to nontransfected L6 myoblasts were not successful, multiple covalently cross-linked bands were readily visible in both FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β L6 myoblast transfectants (Fig. 1B). The FGFR-1α L6 myoblast transfectants exhibited a major band with an apparent Mr between 160–165 kDa, which correlates with a competitive ligand-receptor complex between FGF-1 and the p145 form of FGFR-1α. Interestingly, we were not able to detect a cross-linked band that would correlate with a complex between [125I]FGF-1 and the p125 form of FGFR-1α. In contrast, competitive [125I]FGF-1 covalent cross-linking analysis of the FGFR-1β L6 myoblast transfectants revealed the presence of two bands, a major band with an apparent Mr between 135 and 140 kDa and a minor band with a Mr of approximately 100 kDa (Fig. 1B). Although it is likely that the high Mr band represents a covalent complex between [125I]FGF-1 and p120, we were unable to detect a band that would correlate with a covalent complex between [125I]FGF-1 and p100 (approximate Mr of 120 kDa). Although we do not know the identity of the p100 band, it may represent a degradation product of the high Mr FGFR-1β·;[125I]FGF-1 complex. These data suggest that the high Mr forms of FGFR-1α (p145) and FGFR-1β (p120) but not the low Mr forms of FGFR-1α (p125) and FGFR-1β (p100) are able to associate with exogenous FGF-1. Because the data obtained from competitive [125I]FGF-1·;FGFR-1 covalent cross-linking analysis suggested that only the high Mr forms of FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β are able to bind FGF-1, we were curious whether this discriminatory pattern would also be evident in the ability of FGF-1 to induce FGFR-1 autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues. Therefore, FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β L6 myoblasts were treated with exogenous FGF-1, and the cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FGFR-1 antiserum followed by immunoblot analysis using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 2, we were only able to detect the presence of p145 and p120 as phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in the FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β L6 myoblast transfectants, respectively. Thus, our failure to detect p125 and p100 bands as phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in the FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β L6 myoblast transfectants is consistent with the prior observation that only the high Mr forms of FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β are able to associate with exogenous FGF-1. Because the low Mr form of FGFR-1α (p125) and FGFR-1β (p100) are unable to respond to exogenous FGF-1 and autophosphorylate on tyrosine residues, we examined the possibility that there existed a product-precursor relationship between the high and low Mr forms of FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β. In order to address this issue, pulse-chase analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β L6 myoblasts was performed. Using FGFR-1 immunoprecipitation of the FGFR-1α L6 myoblast transfectants, we observed that after a 15-min incubation with [35S]methionine, the radiolabel was present only in the p125 of FGFR-1α (Fig. 3). After 1 h, the p145 form of FGFR-1α was detected, and after 165 min, the label was present exclusively in the p145 form of FGFR-1α. The use of this strategy with FGFR-1β-transfected L6 myoblasts revealed a similar relationship between the early appearance of the p100 form of FGFR-1β and a significant increase in the presence of the p120 form of FGFR-1β very late in the chase (Fig. 3). These data suggest that the p125 form is the precursor of the p145 product of FGFR-1α, and similarly, the p100 form is the precursor of the p120 product of FGFR-1β. Because the high Mr forms of FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β are derived from their corresponding low Mr forms and FGFR-1 does contain N-glycosylation sites (41Lee P.L. Johnson D.E. Cousens L.S. Fried V.A. Williams L.T. Science. 1989; 245: 57-60Google Scholar), we questioned whether the high Mr forms of FGFR-1α (p145) and FGFR-1β (p120) are post-translational modifications of the low Mr forms of FGFR-1α (p125) and FGFR-1β (p100). Pretreatment of [35S]methionine-labeled FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β L6 myoblast transfectants with tunicamycin followed by immunoprecipitation with FGFR-1 antiserum revealed that FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β are synthesized as proteins with apparent Mr of 110 and 95 kDa, respectively (Fig. 4). In addition, we did not observe high Mr forms of FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β under these conditions. Similarly, using an in vitro kinase assay, it was possible to demonstrate that treatment of the FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β immunoprecipitates with N-glyconase yielded a significant decrease in Mr in which the p145 and p125 form of FGFR-1α were converted to p110 and the p120 and p100 forms of FGFR-1β were converted to p95 (data not shown). These data suggest that the p145 and p125 forms of FGFR-1α and the p120 and p100 forms of FGFR-1β are synthesized as a result of post-translational N-glycosylation of the p110 and p95 forms of FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β, respectively. We examined the FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β L6 myoblast transfectants for FGF-1-dependent morphological changes. As shown in Fig. 5 (A and B), the treatment of the FGFR-1α L6 myoblast transfectants with FGF-1 did not result in a change in monolayer phenotype. In contrast, similar treatment of the FGFR-1β L6 myoblast transfectants exhibited a pronounced morphologic change as manifested by the less flattened monolayer appearance and the presence of well rounded yet anchored cells (Fig. 5, C and D). This phenotype was exhibited in at least 50% of the FGFR-1β L6 myoblast transfectant population. Immunofluorescence analysis using anti-vinculin antibodies revealed a significant decrease in the level of focal adhesion sites in the FGFR-1β (Fig. 5, E and F) but not in the FGFR-1α (data not shown) L6 myoblast transfectants. It is well described that the exogenous FGF prototypes traffic to a nuclear locale in a receptor-dependent manner during the entire G1 transition period (5Zhan X. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol.

In an attempt to determine the contribution of the FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β isoforms as potential mediators of this trafficking event, FGFR-1α and FGFR-1β L6 myoblast transfectants were examined for their ability to partition exogenous [125I]FGF-1 between cytosol and nuclear fractions during the immediate-early (2 h) and mid-to-late (6 h) G1 phase of the cell cycle. In these experiments, the transfected L6 myoblasts were pretreated at 37°C with cold FGF-1 for the periods of time described in Fig. 6, washed with heparin, and treated with [125I]FGF-1 for 2 h, after which the cells were lysed and cytosol and nuclear fractions prepared. As shown in Fig. 6, FGFR-1α L6 myoblast transfectants exhibited a significant level of nuc"
https://openalex.org/W1974084499,"We have recently provided morphological evidence that a key event in the assembly of vaccinia virus is the formation of a novel cisternal domain of the intermediate compartment (IC) between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex (Sodeik, B., Doms, R. W., Ericsson, M., Hiller, G., Machamer, C. E., van't Hof, W., van Meer, G., Moss, B., and Griffiths, G. (1993) J. Cell Biol. 121, 521–541). This tightly apposed cisternal domain incompletely surrounds the spherical immature virus that matures into the first of the two distinct infectious forms of vaccinia, the intracellular mature virus (IMV). In this study we describe the characterization of an abundant membrane protein of the IMV, the gene product of A17L, a 21-kDa protein that has recently been shown to be essential for the formation of the viral membranes (Rodriguez, D., Esteban, M., and Rodriguez, J. R. (1995) J. Virol. 69, 4640-4648). Upon translation in vitro, p21 associated with rough microsomal membranes in a co-translational manner. Using NH2- and COOH-terminal specific antibodies, we show that both in vitro as well as in vivo, p21 adopts a topology where the NH2 and COOH termini are cytoplasmically orientated. Immunocytochemical experiments demonstrated that p21 is a component of the inner of the two cisternal membranes of the immature virus as well as of membranes of the IC, identified using antibodies against Rab1.Taken together, these data provide the first molecular evidence in support of our assembly model; they show that an essential membrane protein of the IMV inserts into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, but gets efficiently targeted to the IC and membranes of the viral factory.

Vaccinia virus, the best characterized member of the orthopoxviridae is a double-stranded DNA virus, whose genomic size approaches 200 kilobases, that encodes for over 200 proteins. Approximately half of these proteins are part of the structure of the infectious particles, while the non-structural proteins carry out a variety of complex viral functions (Moss, 36Moss B. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Chanock R.M. Hirsch M.S. Melnick J.L. Monath T.P. Roizman B. Fields Virology. Raven Press Ltd., New York1990: 2079Google Scholar). This virus family is unique in having two different infectious forms, the intracellular mature virus (IMV) 1The abbreviations used are: IMVintracellular mature virusEEVextracellular enveloped virusIVimmature virusICintermediate compartmentERendoplasmic reticulumGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateSRPsignal recognition particleVVvaccinia virusDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFCSfetal calf serumPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered salineDTTdithiothreitolPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. and the more complex extracellular enveloped virus (EEV) which is enclosed by one additional membrane relative to the IMV (Griffiths and Rottier, 20Griffiths G. Rottier P.J.M. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 367-381Google Scholar). intracellular mature virus extracellular enveloped virus immature virus intermediate compartment endoplasmic reticulum guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate signal recognition particle vaccinia virus Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal calf serum polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline dithiothreitol phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The first morphological signs of the infection process is the appearance, at approximately 3 h after infection, of large structures enriched in DNA in the infected host cell, easily visualized by DNA dyes (Cairns, 7Cairns H.J.F. Virology. 1960; 11: 603-623Google Scholar). These structures are the sites of DNA replication and transcription (Moss, 36Moss B. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Chanock R.M. Hirsch M.S. Melnick J.L. Monath T.P. Roizman B. Fields Virology. Raven Press Ltd., New York1990: 2079Google Scholar). The first ultrastructural evidence for viral membrane assembly is the presence of rigid, curved membrane structures (the crescents) that, although still open to the cytoplasm (Sodeik et al., 58Sodeik B. Doms R.W. Ericsson M. Hiller G. Machamer C.E. van't Hof W. van Meer G. Moss B. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 521-541Google Scholar) can give rise to perfectly spherical profiles (the so-called immature virus (IV)) as seen by thin section EM (Dales, 10Dales S. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 18: 51-72Google Scholar). These structures then enclose the viral DNA (Morgan, 35Morgan C. Science. 1976; 193: 591-592Google Scholar) to form the IMV whose DNA is completely protected from the outside environment. A long standing dogma in the vaccinia field proposed that the viral membranes, were the result of a poorly defined de novo mechanism of membrane synthesis (see 11Dales S. Pogo B.G.T. Virol. Monogr. 1981; 18: 1-109Google Scholar, 34Mohandas A.R. Dales S. Virology. 1995; 214: 494-502Google Scholar, and Wilton et al. (66Wilton S. Mohandas A.R. Dales S. Virology. 1995; 214: 503-511Google Scholar)). We have recently challenged this view and provided evidence that the crescents and the IVs are composed of not one, but two, tightly apposed membranes reminiscent of cellular junctions. Moreover, structural and immunocytochemical data showed that the viral-induced cisternal membranes are continuous with membranes of the intermediate compartment (IC) between the rough ER and the Golgi complex. In conjunction with lipid analysis showing that the lipids of the IMV membranes resembled the ER more than other organelles (Sodeik et al., 58Sodeik B. Doms R.W. Ericsson M. Hiller G. Machamer C.E. van't Hof W. van Meer G. Moss B. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 521-541Google Scholar), these data led to a unique model of the assembly of vaccinia postulating that the process depended on the formation of a newly synthesized, vaccinia-dependent, cisternal domain arising from the IC. One consequence of this mechanism is that the outer surface of the IMV is topologically equivalent to the cytoplasmic surface of cellular membranes, rather than the luminal domain, as in most other enveloped viruses that bud at intracellular membranes. A prediction of this assembly mechanism based on known cell biological principles (Griffiths and Rottier, 20Griffiths G. Rottier P.J.M. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 367-381Google Scholar) was that the process would require the presence of vaccinia-encoded membrane protein(s) that behaved as markers of the IC. Thus, the model required that at least one vaccinia-encoded membrane protein would insert into the rough ER and, following folding and assembly, be transported to and retained in the IC. Since the IVs curve in one direction, a further requirement of this model is the need for the cisterna to be polarized such that two distinct classes of vaccinia integral membrane proteins would be sorted to the outer and inner membrane profile of the IC-derived cisterna, that is evident in thin section EM. Supporting this view is our recent data showing that two peripheral membrane proteins, p14 (gene A27L) and p65 (D13L; the target of the drug rifampicin, which reversibly blocks IV assembly) (Moss et al., 37Moss B. Rosenblum E.N. Katz E. Grimley P.M. Nature. 1969; 224: 1280-1284Google Scholar; Baldick and Moss, 3Baldick C.J. Moss B. Virology. 1987; 156: 138-145Google Scholar; Tartaglia et al., 62Tartaglia J. Piccini A. Paoletti E. Virology. 1986; 150: 45-54Google Scholar), are differentially targeted to the outer and inner membrane, respectively (Sodeik et al., 59Sodeik B. Griffiths G. Ericsson M. Moss B. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1103-1114Google Scholar, 60Sodeik B. Cudmore S. Ericsson M. Esteban M. Niles E.G. Griffiths G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3560-3574Google Scholar). Presumably, these peripheral membrane proteins are binding to two distinct integral membrane proteins in the two cisternal bilayers. The IC (also referred to as the cis-Golgi network and ERGIC) is the focus of considerable controversy, since the realization that a number of antigens localized specifically to membrane structures distal to the rough ER and proximal to the first Golgi compartment (Hauri and Schweizer, 24Hauri H.-P. Schweizer A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 600-608Google Scholar; Saraste and Svensson, 54Saraste J. Svensson K. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 415-430Google Scholar; Hobman et al., 25Hobman T.C. Woodward L. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 795-811Google Scholar; Griffiths and Rottier, 20Griffiths G. Rottier P.J.M. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 367-381Google Scholar). We define the latter as the site where the trimming of mannose residues on N-linked oligosaccharides down to five mannose residues occurs, as well as the compartment where the acquisition of sensitivity to digestion with endoglycosidase-D by this class of oligosaccharides takes place (Krijnse- Locker et al., 26Ichihashi Y. Takahashi T. Oie M. Virology. 1994; 202: 834-843Google Scholar). A key finding in this field has been to show that the entry from the ER into the first Golgi compartment is blocked at 15°C (Saraste and Kuismanen, 53Saraste J. Kuismanen E. Cell. 1984; 38: 535-549Google Scholar) or by energy blocks (Balch et al., 2Balch W.E. Elliott M.M. Keller D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14681-14689Google Scholar). Furthermore, genetic, biochemical, and electron microscopical data argue strongly for a minimum of one vesicular transport step between the ER and the Golgi in both mammalian cells and in yeast (see Beckers et al. (4Beckers C.J.M. Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18298-18310Google Scholar) and 45Rexach M.F. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 219-229Google Scholar). We have recently shown that, at 15°C or in the presence of GTPγS, β cop-containing (or cop I) buds accumulate in the IC (Krijnse Locker et al., 27Krijnse-Locker J. Ericsson M. Rottier P. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 55-70Google Scholar; Griffiths et al., 22Griffiths G. Pepperkok R. Krijnse-Locker J. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2839-2856Google Scholar) and have provided data arguing that the membranes of the IC are physically and functionally continuous with the rough ER. Moreover, these cop I buds contained the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus when the entry of the latter was blocked at 15°C (Griffiths et al., 22Griffiths G. Pepperkok R. Krijnse-Locker J. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2839-2856Google Scholar). This model of structural and functional continuity between the rough ER and a complex IC network, extending into the periphery of the Golgi stack, is also supported by a large number of classical ultrastructural studies (see 8Claude A. J. Cell Biol. 1970; 47: 745-766Google Scholar, Lindsey and Ellisman (31Lindsey J.D. Ellisman M.H. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5 (a): 3111-3123Google Scholar, 32Lindsey J.D. Ellisman M.H. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5 (b): 3124-3134Google Scholar), Sesso et al. (57Sesso A. de Faria F.P. Iwamura E.S. Correa H. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 517-528Google Scholar), and Clermont et al. (9Clermont Y. Rambourg A. Hermo L. Anat. Rec. 1994; 240: 469-480Google Scholar), as well as a recent study using defined markers (Stinchcombe et al., 61Stinchcombe J.C. Nomoto H. Cutler D.F. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1387-1401Google Scholar)). In spite of these extensive ultrastructural data, alternative views persist (Pelham, 40Pelham H.R. Cell. 1994; 79: 1125-1127Google Scholar; Aridor et al., 1Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 875-893Google Scholar). The membrane protein p21 (A17L) of vaccinia seemed a good candidate to test our model on the production of VV membranes from the IC. This protein was recently shown to be essential for virus assembly, and in its absence no IVs are formed (Rodriguez et al., 47Rodriguez D. Esteban M. Rodriguez J.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4640-4648Google Scholar). It is a non-glycosylated integral membrane protein made as a 23-kDa precursor that is cleaved at a later step of IMV assembly (Rodriguez et al., 46Rodriguez D. Rodriguez J.R. Esteban M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3435-3440Google Scholar; Whitehead and Hruby, 64Whitehead S.S. Hruby D.E. Virology. 1994; 200: 154-161Google Scholar). Moreover, this protein has been shown to form specific complexes with the peripheral, outer membrane protein p14 (Rodriguez et al., 46Rodriguez D. Rodriguez J.R. Esteban M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3435-3440Google Scholar). In this study we show that p21 of vaccinia has the hallmarks of a resident protein of the IC that is co-translationally inserted (SRP-dependent) into the rough ER. HeLa cells (CCL2) were obtained from ATTC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing penicillin and streptomycin and 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (DMEM/FCS). For most experiments a deletion mutant of VV strain Western Reserve, vRB12 (a kind gift of Dr. B. Moss) was used. This mutant virus lacks the 37-kDa EEV protein and therefore cannot make IEV and EEV (Blasco and Moss, 6Blasco R. Moss B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5910-5920Google Scholar). The virus was propagated in HeLa cells and purified as described (Roos et al., 48Roos N. Cyrklaff M. Cudmore S. Blasco R. Krijnse Locker J. Griffiths G. EMBO J. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Since vRB12 does not make plaques on cell monolayers, the stocks were titrated by immunofluorescence. Peptide antibodies were raised against the following peptides: SYLRYYNMLDDFSAG (NH2-terminal, residues 2–16) and KPYTAGNKVDVDIPTFNSLNTDDY (COOH-terminal, residues 180–203). These peptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Rabbits were immunized and bled as described and the serum collected and stored at −20°C. 2S. Cudmore, R. Blasco, R. Vincentelli, B. Sodeik, G. Griffiths, and J. Krijnse-Locker, manuscript in preparation. Antibodies recognizing a 39-kDa core protein (A4L) were from Dr. M. Esteban (Maa and Esteban, 33Maa J.-S. Esteban M. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3910-3919Google Scholar). The NH2- and COOH-terminal specific antibodies recognizing the mouse hepatitis virus M protein have been described previously (Krijnse Locker et al., 28Locker J.K. Rose J.K. Horzinek M.C. Rottier P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21911-21918Google Scholar). VRB12 infected cells, grown in 6-cm dishes, were starved in methionine/cysteine-free DMEM at 6.5 h post-infection. The cells were pulse-labeled for 5 min at 7 h post-infection with 200 µCi/dish EXPRE35S35S (DuPont NEN), washed once with PBS, and chased in DMEM for 30, 60, and 120 min. The cells were lysed as before in 500 µl lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (Krijnse Locker et al., 28Locker J.K. Rose J.K. Horzinek M.C. Rottier P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21911-21918Google Scholar). The lysate was immunoprecipitated using 5 µl of the NH2-terminal antibody as described by Krijnse Locker et al. (28Locker J.K. Rose J.K. Horzinek M.C. Rottier P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21911-21918Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed in a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For the two-dimensional gel blot of p21, purified IMV was incubated for 30 min at 37°C in first dimension lysis buffer (9.8 M urea, 2% ampholines (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) pH 7–9, 4% Nonidet P-40, 100 mM DTT) and subsequently isoelectric focused using a Bio-Rad mini-two-dimensional gel system and a pH gradient from 3 to 7 and run in the second dimension on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Two 10-cm dishes of HeLa cells were infected with vRB12 for 1 h at 37°C, after which the inoculum was replaced by DMEM/FCS containing 100 µg/ml rifampicin. At 9 h post-infection, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped from the dish in PBS, and gently pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 1 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 350 µl of 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 9, and the cells broken by 15–20 strokes of a 2-ml Dounce homogenizer. The nuclei were removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 3000 rpm. The post-nuclear supernatant was treated with 100 and 200 µg/ml trypsin (Sigma) and protease K (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), for 30 min at 37°C or at 4°C, respectively. Trypsin treatment was stopped with aprotinin (4 µg/ml; Sigma) and trypsin inhibitor (200 µg/ml; Sigma), and to the protease K-treated samples PMSF (4 µg/ml; Sigma) was added. The digested and untreated post-nuclear supernatant were run on SDS-PAGE and p21 was detected by Western blotting using the NH2-terminal antibody at 1:400 and the COOH-terminal antibody at 1:1000 as described (Ericsson et al., 13Ericsson M. Cudmore S. Shuman S. Condit R.C. Griffiths G. Krijnse Locker J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7072-7086Google Scholar). The protease treatment of purified IMV was carried out as described before (Roos et al., 48Roos N. Cyrklaff M. Cudmore S. Blasco R. Krijnse Locker J. Griffiths G. EMBO J. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Purified vRB12 was briefly sonicated and incubated for 30 at 37°C with 20 mM DTT in 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 9. Then an equal volume of 2% Nonidet P-40, 40 mM DTT was added and the incubation continued for another 30 min. After a brief second sonication, the sample was layered onto 50 µl of 36% (w/v) sucrose in 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 9, and centrifuged for 30 min at 24 p.s.i. in a Beckman Airfuge. The upper phase was concentrated by acetone precipitation and, like the pellet, dissolved in LSB. The samples were run on 15% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose, and p21 was detected as described above. A recombinant plasmid, pUCA17L, containing the gene A17L of VV strain WR, was obtained from Dr. M. Esteban. The gene had been polymerase chain reaction-amplified from the VV WR genome using the following primers: 5′-CCGGATCCCCCATGAGTTATTTAAGATATT-3′ (upstream) and 5′-TATCTGCTATTCCTGGTG-3′ (downstream). The BamHI restriction site in the upstream primer and a PvuII site downstream of the gene were digested and used to clone the gene into BamHI/SmaI-digested pUC19. Subsequently, the gene was cut from this vector using SalI and SacI and positioned downstream of the T7 RNA polymerase promotor of plasmid pBSSK (Stratagene) to generate T7 expression vector pBSA17L. Sequence analysis of the A17L gene in pBSA17L showed that its sequence was completely identical to the previously published sequence of VV Copenhagen strain (Goebel et al., 18Goebel S.J. Johnson G.P. Perkus M.E. Davis S.W. Winslow J.P. Paoletti E. Virology. 1990; 179: 247-266Google Scholar). To create a second expression vector, which allowed expression driven by a cellular promotor, the A17L gene was cut from pBSA17L using XbaI and KpnI and cloned downstream of the α-globin promotor of vector pCMUII, a derivative of pC81G (Pääbo et al., 39Pääbo S. Weber F. Nilsson T. Schaffner W. Petterson P.A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1921-1927Google Scholar) a kind gift of Dr. T. Nilsson. The generation of pTz vector bearing the MHV-M protein has been described before (Krijnse Locker et al., 28Locker J.K. Rose J.K. Horzinek M.C. Rottier P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21911-21918Google Scholar). For the indirect immunofluorescence, HeLa cells grown on coverslips were infected with vRB12 and fixed at 7.5 h, post-infected by a 5-min incubation at −20°C with precooled methanol. The cells were rinsed with PBS and blocked with 5% FCS in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. To detect p21 by indirect immunofluorescence, we used the COOH-terminal antibody at 1:150 and a goat anti-rabbit conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate from Dianova (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). The labeled cells were subsequently incubated with 5 µg/ml Hoechst B2883 (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature to label the DNA. Cryosections of HeLa cells infected for 7.5 h were prepared as described before (Ericsson et al., 13Ericsson M. Cudmore S. Shuman S. Condit R.C. Griffiths G. Krijnse Locker J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7072-7086Google Scholar). Transfection of p21 was performed as follows. HeLa cells either grown on coverslips (for IF) or in 6-cm dishes (for EM) were infected with VVT7-3 (a kind gift of Dr. B. Moss) for 45 min at 37°C. The inoculum was removed and replaced by serum-free DMEM containing 5 mM hydroxyurea (Sigma). The cells were left for 15 min at 37°C before transfection. The infected cells were transfected using DOTAP (Boehringer GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and 2 µg of CsCl purified pBsA17L/3.5-cm dish, in serum-free DMEM containing hydroxyurea. Infected and transfected cells were fixed for either IF or EM at 6 h post-transfection. The pre-embedding labeling was performed as follows. Six-cm dishes of HeLa cells, infected for 6 h, were incubated for approximately 5 min at room temperature in water. When the cells were sufficiently swollen, the water was quickly replaced by 4% paraformaldehyde in 250 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4. This sudden change of osmolarity caused the cells to break open while being fixed. The cells were fixed in this solution for 10 min at room temperature, rinsed extensively with PBS and 20 mM glycine, blocked with PBS/glycine containing 5% FCS for 2 h at 4°C, and incubated overnight at 4°C with the antibodies (diluted in PBS/glycine-FCS; NH2-terminal 1:100, COOH-terminal 1:300). After thorough washing with PBS/glycine, the cells were incubated for 3 h at 4°C with protein A-gold diluted in PBS/glycine-FCS, washed extensively before fixation with 1% glutaraldehyde and embedding into Epon. The quantitation of the labeling was done as follows. For each antibody, 100 IVs or crescents were counted that were labeled by at least one gold particle. Gold particles were classified as being either on the inner or outer membrane when the labeling was not further than 20 nm from the IV membrane (Griffiths, 19Griffiths G. Fine Structure Immunocytochemistry. Springer -Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1993Google Scholar). For the immunofluorescence in permeabilized cells, infected and rifampicin-blocked cells were permeabilized with streptolysin O and immunolabeled as described previously (Krijnse Locker et al., 29Krijnse Locker J. Parton R.G. Fuller S.D. Griffiths G. Dotti C.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1315-1332Google Scholar), except that 2 units/ml SLO was used instead of 3 units/ml and that GTPγS was omitted. The cytoplasmically exposed domains were visualized using the NH2- (1:100) and COOH-terminal (1:150) antibodies. In vitro translation of pBSA17L was done using the T7-coupled transcription and translation system provided by Promega (Promega, Madison, WI). Dog pancreatic rough microsomes were a kind gift of Katja Schroeder and Dr. Bernard Dobberstein. To remove endogenous mRNAs, the microsomes were treated with micrococcal nuclease. Rough microsomes were diluted in RM buffer (50 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mM KOAC, 2 mM MgAc, 250 mM sucrose, and 1 mM DTT) to an A280 of 20. To this CaCl2 to 1 mM, 150 units/ml micrococcal nuclease (Sigma) and 2 mM PMSF were added and incubated for 10 min at 25°C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2 mM EGTA. The microsomes were layered on top of 500 µl of 0.5 M sucrose in RM buffer and spun for 30 min at 35,000 rpm in a TLS55 Beckman tabletop centrifuge rotor. The pellet was resuspended in 450 µl of RM buffer and the A280 measured against the untreated microsomes. As a control we used the mouse hepatitis M protein, which has been shown to associate with efficiencies of up to 95% with rough microsomal membranes (Rottier et al., 50Rottier P. Brandenburg D. Armstrong J. van der Zeijst B.A.M. Warren G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1421-1425Google Scholar, 51Rottier P.J.M. Armstrong J. Meyer D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4648-4652Google Scholar). The M and p21 protein were translated in vitro according to the instructions of the manufacturer using a 25-µl system. When microsomes were added they were used at 100 A280 units/translation. To test for the membrane insertion, translation mixtures were loaded on top of a 75-µl cushion of 0.5 M sucrose in RM-buffer. The samples were spun for 10 min at 26 p. s. i. in a Beckman Airfuge. The supernatant and the pellet were diluted in 500 µl of lysis buffer (see above) containing 0.2% SDS, and the proteins they contained immunoprecipitated with the COOH-terminal specific antibodies to p21. When testing for the post-translational insertion of p21, 200 µg/ml cycloheximide and microsomes were added at the end of the translation and the incubation continued for 45 min at 30°C, after which the samples were spun as above. For protease treatment of the microsomes, the samples were mixed after translation with an equal volume of protease K diluted in RM buffer at the indicated concentrations and incubated for 30 min on ice. After addition of PMSF, the samples were immunoprecipitated with the NH2- and COOH-terminal specific antibodies. In order to characterize the vaccinia gene A17L, a 21-kDa membrane protein of the IMV, we produced peptide antibodies recognizing its 15 NH2- and 24 COOH-terminal amino acids, respectively. Purified IMV was separated on two-dimensional gels, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with the NH2-terminal peptide serum. Several spots were detected, all running around 21–25 kDa and ranging in pI between 4.5 and 4.1 (Fig. 1). This is consistent with the predicted molecular mass of the protein of around 21 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.2. The COOH-terminal antibody, however, seemed to recognize only the spots running at 25 kDa (not shown), suggesting that the 21-kDa form may be a processed form lacking the extreme COOH terminus (see below). As pointed out in the introduction a critical test of our assembly model is the need to find at least one membrane protein which behaved as a typical marker of the IC and that is targeted to the IC after insertion into the rough ER. Although this may seem a trivial point, we noticed during the mapping of the membrane proteins of the IMV that the virus lacks any typical class I or class II (von Heijne and Gavel, 63von Heijne G. Gavel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 671-678Google Scholar) membrane proteins (see “Discussion”). Also, several of the IMV proteins, which behave like membrane proteins in infected cells, failed to associate with rough microsomal membranes upon in vitro translation. Examples of such proteins are p39 (A4L)2 and p32 (D8L; data not shown) (Niles and Seto, 38Niles E.G. Seto J. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3772-3778Google Scholar), which only associate with membranes in the context of a viral infection. The sequence of p21 contains a very hydrophobic central domain long enough to span a bilayer four times. A recently described secondary structure prediction program was applied to the p21 sequence, focusing especially on predicting putative transmembrane domains (PHDhtm; 49Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Google Scholar). This analysis predicted the four stretches of the sequence between the amino acids 61–77, 81–98, 118–138, and 141–161 to be α-helical, a property of transmembrane domains, suggesting that the protein may span the membrane four times. Moreover, these predicted α-helical regions coincide with the hydrophobic stretches as determined by a Kyte and Doolittle plot (see Rodriguez et al. (46Rodriguez D. Rodriguez J.R. Esteban M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3435-3440Google Scholar)). The p21 protein is not predicted to have a hydrophobic region at its extreme NH2 terminus, nor does a program designed to predict consensus sequences for signal peptidase (according to von Heijne rules) predict that p21 has an NH2-terminal cleavable signal. The p21 sequence thus resembles that of a class of multi-spanning membrane proteins that generally lack cleaved NH2-terminal sequences and that make use of internal hydrophobic domains for insertion (Friedlander and Blobel, 14Friedlander M. Blobel G. Nature. 1985; 318: 338-343Google Scholar; Krijnse Locker et al., 28Locker J.K. Rose J.K. Horzinek M.C. Rottier P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21911-21918Google Scholar) (see 44Rapoport T.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 20: 73-137Google Scholar for a review). To assess whether p21 was able to insert into micosomal membranes, the protein was translated in vitro either in the presence or absence of dog rough microsomes. p21 clearly inserted into microsomes; about 80% pelleted with the membranes, while the protein remained in the supernatant when microsomes were not added to the translation mixture (Fig. 2). If the membranes were added after blocking translation with cycloheximide p21 did not pellet, indicating that the insertion into mic"
https://openalex.org/W2092665603,"We recently reported that a functional ligand-binding site of an alpha-amino-5-methyl-3-hydroxy-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA)-selective glutamate receptor (GluR)-D subunit can be expressed in insect cells as a soluble, N-glycosylated fusion protein consisting of two segments (S1 and S2) that are related by amino acid sequence to bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (Kuusinen, A., Arvola, M., and Keinanen, K., EMBO J. 14, 6327-6332). In an attempt to further characterize the structural determinants for ligand binding, we have now expressed the ligand-binding sites of GluR-B and GluR-D subunits in Escherichia coli as soluble periplasmic proteins. The bacterially expressed S1-S2 fusion proteins bound [3H]AMPA with a high affinity (Kd of 12 nM for GluR-B, Kd of 60 nM for GluR-D) and with a ligand pharmacology typical of native AMPA receptors, indicating that N-linked glycosylation is not required for the formation or the maintenance of the ligand-binding site. The flip and flop splice variants of the GluR-D S1-S2 fusion protein bound [3H]AMPA with equal affinities, whereas deletion of the C-terminal one-third of the S2 segment including the flip/flop sequence resulted in a loss of binding activity. Our results highlight the potential of bacterial expression for the analysis of the binding site and support a close structural similarity between glutamate receptors and bacterial proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2120001912,"N-terminal peptides of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related peptide (PTHRP) elicit a wide variety of biological responses in target cells, including the inhibition of Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 activity in renal cells. This response is believed to be mediated by ligand binding to a common receptor (i.e. PTH/PTHRP receptor type I) and activation of cAMP-dependent and/or Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinases (PKA and PKC, respectively). However, the mechanism of action of these N-terminal peptides is now unclear because of recent data reporting the existence of additional receptor isoforms. Therefore, to directly examine the ligand binding and signaling characteristics of the PTH/PTHRP receptor type I and its ability to elicit a biological response, cDNAs encoding the rat type I receptor and the rat NHE3 isoform were transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (AP-1) cells that lack endogenous expression of these proteins. Competition binding assays using [125I-Tyr36]PTHRP-(1–36)-NH2 radioligand indicated that several biologically active human N-terminal PTH and PTHRP fragments (PTH-(1–34), PTH-(3–34), PTH-(28–42), PTH-(28–48), and PTHRP-(1–34)) were capable of binding to the type I receptor. Both PTH-(1–34) and PTHRP-(1–34) stimulated adenylate cyclase and PKC activities in these cells, whereas PTH-(3–34), PTH-(28–42), and PTH-(28–48) selectively enhanced only PKC activity. PTHRP-(1–16), a biologically inert fragment, was incapable of binding to this receptor and influencing either the PKA or PKC pathway. Furthermore, all the analogues with the exception of PTHRP-(1–16) inhibited NHE3 activity. Inhibition of PKC by the potent antagonist chelerythrine chloride abolished the depression of NHE3 activity by PTH-(3–34), PTH-(28–42), and PTH-(28–48) but did not alleviate the effects of PTH-(1–34). Likewise, antagonism of PKA by H-89 was unable to prevent the inhibition caused by PTH-(1–34). However, inhibition of both PKA and PKC by the nonselective protein kinase antagonist H-7 abolished the reduction of NHE3 activity by PTH-(1–34). These data indicate that discrete N-terminal analogues of PTH and PTHRP can interact with the classical PTH/PTHRP receptor type I and activate PKA and/or PKC.

PTH-related peptide (PTHRP), and their N-terminal analogues influence plasma calcium and phosphate homeostasis by regulating a variety of membrane ion channels and transporters within target cells, including Ca2+ channels (1Yamaguihi D.T. Hahn T.J. Iida-Klein A. Kleeman C.R. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7711-7718Google Scholar), Cl− channels (2Chesnoy-Marchais D. Fritsch J. Pflügers Arch. 1989; 415: 104-114Google Scholar), Na+/Pi cotransporters (3Malmström K. Stange G. Murer H. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 207-213Google Scholar, 4Bringhurst F.R. Jüppner H. Guo J. Ureña P. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Abou-Samra A.-B. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2090-2098Google Scholar), and Na+/H+ exchangers (5Pollock A.S. Warnock D.G. Strewler G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: F217-F225Google Scholar, 6Helmle-Kolb C. Montrose M.H. Stange G. Murer H. Pflügers Arch. 1990; 415: 461-470Google Scholar, 7Azarani A. Goltzman D. Orlowski J. J. Biol.

This multiplicity of actions is generally believed to reflect ligand binding to a common heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptor that is linked to multiple effector systems (i.e. adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C) (9Abou-Samra A.-B. Jüppner H. Force T. Freeman M.W. Kong X.F. Schipani E. Ureña P. Richards J. Bonventre J.V. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2732-2736Google Scholar). This is exemplified in renal proximal tubule OK cells where N-terminal peptide fragments of PTH and PTHRP (i.e. PTH-(1–34), PTH-(3–34), PTH-(28–42), PTH-(28–48), and PTHRP-(1–34)) rapidly inhibit the activity of the apically localized Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 isoform by a mechanism involving cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (PKC) (7Azarani A. Goltzman D. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20004-20010Google Scholar). This regulation is remarkable given that PTH (an 84-amino acid peptide) and PTHRP (a 139–173-amino acid peptide depending on the species) (10Orloff J.J. Wu T.L. Stewart A.F. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 476-495Google Scholar) share minimal identity in primary structure, with only 8 of the 13 N-terminal amino acids being common between these two peptides. PTH and PTHRP require the first two N-terminal amino acids and amino acids 25–34 to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity (11Goltzman D. Peytremann A. Callahan E. Tregear G.W. Potts Jr., J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3199-3203Google Scholar, 12Rabbani S.A. Kaiser S.M. Henderson J.E. Bernier S.M. Mouland A.J. Roy D.R. Zahab D.M. Sung W.L. Goltzman D. Hendy G.N.

Med. 1986; 315: 1004-1013Google Scholar). In contrast, amino acids 3–34 and even smaller regions (amino acids 28–34) appear sufficient to activate PKC translocation to the plasma membrane (15Fujimori A. Cheng S.L. Avioli L.V. Civitelli R. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 29-36Google Scholar, 16Jouishomme H. Whitfield J.F. Chakravarthy B. Durkin J.P. Gagnon L. Isaacs R.J. Maclean S. Neugebauer W. Willick G. Rixon R.H.

Res. 1994; 9: 943-949Google Scholar).However, the universality of this signaling paradigm to account for the diverse actions of N-terminal analogues of PTH and PTHRP is no longer tenable in view of recent data reporting the existence of additional related receptors. Usdin et al. (18Usdin T.B. Gruber C. Bonner T.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15455-15458Google Scholar) recently isolated and characterized a unique receptor (called PTH2) from a rat brain cDNA library that shares 70% amino acid identity to the classical PTH/PTHRP receptor (type I). PTH2 mRNA is expressed predominantly in brain and pancreas, and to a much lesser extent in placenta and testis. PTH2 is also functionally distinguished from the type I receptor by its selective binding of PTH and by its potent activation of adenylate cyclase activity.In addition, biochemical studies in normal keratinocytes and squamous carcinoma cell lines suggest the existence of a novel PTH/PTHRP receptor (type II) that differs qualitatively in its intracellular signaling properties from those of the type I receptor and PTH2 (19Orloff J.J. Kats Y. Ureña P. Schipani E. Vasavada R.C. Philbrick W.M. Behal A. Abou-Samra A.-B. Segre G.V. Jüppner H. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3016-3023Google Scholar). This potential receptor is activated by N-terminal peptide fragments of both PTH and PTHRP, leading to increases in intracellular Ca2+ but not cAMP. These cells also express multiple mRNA transcripts that hybridize to type I receptor cDNA probes, yet differ significantly in size from the type I receptor mRNA present in human bone SaOS-2 cells. Differently sized transcripts are also observed in rat kidney, liver, skin, and testes (20Ureña P. Kong X.F. Abou-Samra A.-B. Jüppner H. Kronenberg H.M. Potts Jr., J.T. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 617-623Google Scholar). These data have been interpreted to indicate the presence of a distinct gene product or an alternatively spliced variant of the type I receptor.Other circumstantial evidence also supports the existence of multiple receptors. A C-terminal peptide of human PTH (i.e. PTH-(53–84)) elicits a number of biological responses in rat osteosarcoma cells (21Murray T.M. Rao L.G. Muzaffar S.A. Ly H. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 1097-1099Google Scholar, 22Kaji H. Sugimoto T. Kanatani M. Miyauchi A. Kimura T. Sakakibara S. Fukase M. Chihara K. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1897-1904Google Scholar) yet fails to bind to the human PTH/PTHRP receptor type I stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells (23Pines M. Adams A.E. Stueckle S. Bessalle R. Rashti-Behar V. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Suva L.J. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1713-1715Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the biological activity of some of these N- and C-terminal analogues is actually elicited by selective binding to other, as yet uncharacterized, PTH/PTHRP receptors. Understanding the signaling mechanism of these PTH/PTHRP analogues is of physiological relevance as parathyroid cells normally secrete peptide fragments of PTH (24MacGregor R.R. Jilka R.L. Hamilton J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1929-1934Google Scholar).In view of these data, we tested the hypothesis that N-terminal analogues of PTH and PTHRP can bind to and activate the PTH/PTHRP receptor type I, stimulate PKA and PKC, and acutely regulate the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 isoform, as is believed to occur in renal cells. This was accomplished by transient and stable transfection of cDNAs encoding the rat PTH/PTHRP receptor type I and the rat Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 isoform into Chinese hamster ovary AP-1 cells that are devoid of endogenous Na+/H+ exchanger activity and lack responsiveness to PTH or PTHRP. The data clearly demonstrate that the AP-1-transfected cells were able to bind the various PTH and PTHRP analogues, stimulate production of multiple second messengers, and elicit biological responses in a manner that precisely mimics the responses observed in renal OK cells. Although the data do not exclude the presence of other PTH/PTHRP receptors in OK cells, it suggests that the PTH/PTHRP receptor type I is sufficient to mediate the diverse biological actions of these N-terminal PTH and PTHRP analogues in these cells.DISCUSSIONThe PTH/PTHRP receptor type I has been cloned from many tissues such as bone and kidney (9Abou-Samra A.-B.

Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Google Scholar). Common features of these receptors include similar membrane topology (i.e. seven membrane-spanning segments) and the ability to activate G-proteins that modulate the adenylate cyclase-cAMP-PKA and/or phospholipase C-diacylglycerol-PKC pathways.Until recently, the ability of a single PTH/PTHRP receptor (i.e. type I) to couple to multiple effector systems was generally believed to account for the pleiotropic effects of PTH and PTHRP and their respective analogues in various target tissues (9Abou-Samra A.-B. Jüppner H. Force T. Freeman M.W. Kong X.F. Schipani E. Ureña P. Richards J. Bonventre J.V. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2732-2736Google Scholar). However, this paradigm is no longer tenable following the discovery of a second receptor, PTH2, that is expressed primarily in brain and pancreas and is distinguished by its ability to bind only PTH and to activate the PKA pathway (18Usdin T.B. Gruber C. Bonner T.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15455-15458Google Scholar).Other lines of investigation also indicate that additional PTH/PTHRP receptors may exist. 1) N-terminal analogues of PTH and PTHRP activate PKC activity in ROS 17/2 osteosarcoma cells in a biphasic manner, with one peak of activity obtained at low picomolar concentrations and the other at nanomolar concentrations (16Jouishomme H. Whitfield J.F. Chakravarthy B. Durkin J.P. Gagnon L. Isaacs R.J. Maclean S. Neugebauer W. Willick G. Rixon R.H. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 53-60Google Scholar, 17Jouishomme H. Whitfield J.F. Gagnon L.

Neugebauer W. Willick G. Rixon R.H. Chakravarthy B. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 497-503Google Scholar). Only the latter concentrations are coupled to adenylate cyclase activity. 2) Treatment of normal keratinocytes and squamous carcinoma cell lines with N-terminal peptide fragments of both PTH and PTHRP leads to increases in intracellular Ca2+ but not cAMP (19Orloff J.J. Kats Y. Ureña P. Schipani E. Vasavada R.C. Philbrick W.M. Behal A. Abou-Samra A.-B. Segre G.V. Jüppner H. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3016-3023Google Scholar). The absence of a cAMP response is not a consequence of a dysfunctional signaling pathway, as squamous carcinoma cells stably transfected with the type I receptor show increased cAMP accumulation in response to PTH and PTHRP. These cells also express multiple mRNA transcripts that hybridize to type I receptor cDNA probes, yet differ significantly in size from the type I receptor mRNA present in human bone SaOS-2 cells. Differently sized transcripts are also observed in rat kidney, liver, skin, and testes (20Ureña P. Kong X.F. Abou-Samra A.-B. Jüppner H. Kronenberg H.M. Potts Jr., J.T. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 617-623Google Scholar). 3) C-terminal analogues of human PTH, such as PTH-(53–84), do not directly bind to the human PTH/PTHRP receptor type I and are unable to alter intracellular cAMP and Ca2+ levels, yet apparently retain the ability to stimulate alkaline phosphatase activity, osteoclast-like cell formation, and bone-resorbing activity by mature osteoclasts (21Murray T.M. Rao L.G. Muzaffar S.A. Ly H. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 1097-1099Google Scholar, 22Kaji H. Sugimoto T. Kanatani M. Miyauchi A. Kimura T. Sakakibara S. Fukase M. Chihara K.

Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1713-1715Google Scholar). 4) Likewise, C-terminal analogues of human PTHRP, such as PTHRP-(107–139), also do not bind to the PTH/PTHRP receptor type I, yet appear to signal by increasing intracellular Ca2+, but not cAMP, in hippocampal neurons (45Fukayama S. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Davis J.N. Chisholm J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10182-10186Google Scholar). 5) Radioligand and affinity cross-linking studies have identified a 90-kDa protein in rat osteosarcoma (ROS 17/2.8) and rat parathyroid (PT-r3) cells that selectively binds with high affinity to the C-terminal region of PTH-(1–84) (46Inomata N.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4732-4740Google Scholar). 6) Apical and basolateral membranes isolated from rat renal cortical cells contain PTH/PTHRP receptors that differ quantitatively in their coupling to G-proteins and second messenger systems (47Kaufmann M. Muff R. Stieger B. Biber J. Murer H. Fischer J.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1173-1178Google Scholar). These data have been interpreted to indicate the existence of a novel PTH/PTHRP receptor(s) or an alternatively spliced variant of the type I receptor, although other explanations, such as differences in the membrane environment or the signaling repertoire of the cell, may also explain some of the data.Nevertheless, in view of the above observations, it was important to establish whether the regulation of the apical Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 isoform by synthetic N-terminal analogues of PTH and PTHRP in renal OK cells could be solely accounted for by activation of the PTH/PTHRP receptor type I known to be expressed in this cell line. The data in this study clearly demonstrate that structurally diverse N-terminal analogues of PTH and PTHRP (i.e. PTH-(1–34), PTH-(3–34), PTH-(28–42), PTH-(28–48), and PTHRP-(1–34)) are able to directly bind to the rat PTH/PTHRP receptor type I, activate distinct second messenger systems, and elicit biological responses (i.e. inhibition of rat NHE3 activity) in a heterologous mammalian expression system.Examination of these N-terminal analogues complement and extend previous studies that have tested the effects of PTH-(1–34), PTH-(3–34), or PTH-(7–34) on second messenger production in transiently transfected COS-7 cells (9Abou-Samra A.-B.

In total, these data clearly establish that the N-terminal domains of PTH and PTHRP, despite having different amino acid sequences, probably share sufficient tertiary structure to bind to the type I receptor and activate the PKA and/or PKC pathways. Whether these analogues bind to the same or different regions of the receptor is unknown. The molecular mechanism by which some of these analogues can selectively activate PKC but not PKA is an area of particular interest. Recent structural studies of the type I receptor indicate that amino acids near the N terminus (residues 31–47) and within the third extracellular loop (residues 431–440) are important for ligand-receptor interactions (48Jüppner H. Schipani E. Bringhurst F.R. McClure I. Keutmann H.T. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Abou-Samra A.-B. Segre G.V. Gardella T.J. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 879-884Google Scholar, 49Lee C. Gardella T.J.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 281-285Google Scholar).In this study, significant differences were observed in the concentration of PTH-(1–34) required to induce PTH/PTHRP receptor type I activation of adenylate cyclase (K0.5∼10−10M) and PKC (K0.5 <10−11M) activities. As only one type of receptor is present in these cells, this difference appears to be an intrinsic feature of the protein and likely reflects differential sensitivities of the two signaling pathways to fractional occupancy of a single receptor. These kinetic differences mimic that observed in the opossum renal proximal tubule OK cell line which expresses endogenous PTH/PTHRP receptor type I and apical NHE3 activity (7Azarani A. Goltzman D. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20004-20010Google Scholar, 37Jüppner H. Abou-Samra A.-B. Freeman M. Kong X.F. Schipani E. Richards J. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Hock J. Potts Jr., J.T.

Although the results do not exclude the presence of other PTH/PTHRP receptors in OK and other renal proximal tubule cells, it suggests that the PTH/PTHRP receptor type I is sufficient to mediate the diverse biological actions of these N-terminal PTH and PTHRP analogues in these and possibly other cell types.

PTH-related peptide (PTHRP), and their N-terminal analogues influence plasma calcium and phosphate homeostasis by regulating a variety of membrane ion channels and transporters within target cells, including Ca2+ channels (1Yamaguihi D.T.

Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Abou-Samra A.-B. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2090-2098Google Scholar), and Na+/H+ exchangers (5Pollock A.S. Warnock D.G. Strewler G.J. Am. J.

This multiplicity of actions is generally believed to reflect ligand binding to a common heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptor that is linked to multiple effector systems (i.e. adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C) (9Abou-Samra A.-B. Jüppner H. Force T. Freeman M.W. Kong X.F. Schipani E. Ureña P. Richards J. Bonventre J.V. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2732-2736Google Scholar). This is exemplified in renal proximal tubule OK cells where N-terminal peptide fragments of PTH and PTHRP (i.e. PTH-(1–34), PTH-(3–34), PTH-(28–42), PTH-(28–48), and PTHRP-(1–34)) rapidly inhibit the activity of the apically localized Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 isoform by a mechanism involving cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (PKC) (7Azarani A. Goltzman D. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20004-20010Google Scholar). This regulation is remarkable given that PTH (an 84-amino acid peptide) and PTHRP (a 139–173-amino acid peptide depending on the species) (10Orloff J.J. Wu T.L. Stewart A.F. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 476-495Google Scholar) share minimal identity in primary structure, with only 8 of the 13 N-terminal amino acids being common between these two peptides. PTH and PTHRP require the first two N-terminal amino acids and amino acids 25–34 to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity (11Goltzman D. Peytremann A. Callahan E. Tregear G.W. Potts Jr., J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3199-3203Google Scholar, 12Rabbani S.A. Kaiser S.M. Henderson J.E. Bernier S.M. Mouland A.J. Roy D.R. Zahab D.M. Sung W.L. Goltzman D. Hendy G.N.

Med. 1986; 315: 1004-1013Google Scholar). In contrast, amino acids 3–34 and even smaller regions (amino acids 28–34) appear sufficient to activate PKC translocation to the plasma membrane (15Fujimori A. Cheng S.L. Avioli L.V. Civitelli R. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 29-36Google Scholar, 16Jouishomme H. Whitfield J.F. Chakravarthy B. Durkin J.P. Gagnon L. Isaacs R.J. Maclean S. Neugebauer W. Willick G. Rixon R.H.

Res. 1994; 9: 943-949Google Scholar).However, the universality of this signaling paradigm to account for the diverse actions of N-terminal analogues of PTH and PTHRP is no longer tenable in view of recent data reporting the existence of additional related receptors. Usdin et al. (18Usdin T.B. Gruber C. Bonner T.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15455-15458Google Scholar) recently isolated and characterized a unique receptor (called PTH2) from a rat brain cDNA library that shares 70% amino acid identity to the classical PTH/PTHRP receptor (type I). PTH2 mRNA is expressed predominantly in brain and pancreas, and to a much lesser extent in placenta and testis. PTH2 is also functionally distinguished from the type I receptor by its selective binding of PTH and by its potent activation of adenylate cyclase activity.In addition, biochemical studies in normal keratinocytes and squamous carcinoma cell lines suggest the existence of a novel PTH/PTHRP receptor (type II) that differs qualitatively in its intracellular signaling properties from those of the type I receptor and PTH2 (19Orloff J.J. Kats Y. Ureña P. Schipani E. Vasavada R.C. Philbrick W.M. Behal A. Abou-Samra A.-B. Segre G.V. Jüppner H. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3016-3023Google Scholar). This potential receptor is activated by N-terminal peptide fragments of both PTH and PTHRP, leading to increases in intracellular Ca2+ but not cAMP. These cells also express multiple mRNA transcripts that hybridize to type I receptor cDNA probes, yet differ significantly in size from the type I receptor mRNA present in human bone SaOS-2 cells. Differently sized transcripts are also observed in rat kidney, liver, skin, and testes (20Ureña P. Kong X.F. Abou-Samra A.-B. Jüppner H. Kronenberg H.M. Potts Jr., J.T. Segre G.V.

https://openalex.org/W2015179997,"The two known receptors mediating the actions of cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin, CCK type A (CCKAR) and CCK type B (CCKBR) receptors, are G protein-coupled receptors having approximately 50% amino acid homology. Both the CCKAR and CCKBR have high affinity for sulfated CCK peptides, while only the CCKBR has high affinity for gastrin peptides. To determine the structural basis for the selectivity of the CCKBR for gastrin, we first constructed a series of CCKB/AR chimeras in which restriction endonuclease-defined segments of the CCKBR were replaced with the corresponding segments of the CCKAR. Chimeras transiently expressed in COS-1 cells were screened for the selective loss of gastrin affinity according to the displacement of 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter-CCK-8 binding by gastrin-17-I and CCK-8. The sequence spanning from transmembrane domain III (TM III) to TM V was the only segment that resulted in the selective loss of gastrin affinity. This segment could account for 100 of the expected 300-fold lower affinity of gastrin-17-I observed for the control CCKAR compared to the control CCKBR. Using site-directed mutagenesis in this segment of the CCKBR, we identified a sequence of 5 amino acids in the second extracellular loop responsible for this 100-fold selective loss in gastrin affinity. 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter-CCK-8 binding displacement by L365,260 (a CCKBR selective antagonist) was unaffected by the changes in these 5 amino acids. These results present for the first time the identification of the amino acid sequence of the CCKBR conferring the majority of the selectivity for gastrin."

Doolittle G.M. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1983: 523Google Scholar). When animal cells are depleted of cholesterol, they do not synthesize appreciable amounts of cholesteryl esters, owing in part to a lack of cholesterol substrate in the ER. When cholesterol enters cells in the core of low density lipoprotein (LDL), the rate of cholesteryl ester synthesis increases markedly (2Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 897-930Google Scholar). This is due to the provision of cholesterol substrate and possibly to an activation of the enzyme's catalytic capacity. New protein synthesis is not required (1Chang T.Y. Doolittle G.M. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1983: 523Google Scholar, 2Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1975; 250: 4025-4027Google Scholar). 25-Hydroxycholesterol itself is esterified, and it also stimulates the esterification of cholesterol, indicating that oxysterols somehow make cholesterol more available to the enzyme (3Brown M.S.

A major step in the molecular understanding of ACAT came from the cDNA cloning of the human enzyme by Chang et al. (4Chang C.C.Y. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Google Scholar). These workers used a clever selection technique to obtain a line of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, designated AC29, that is deficient in ACAT activity and therefore fails to accumulate cholesteryl ester droplets when incubated with LDL or 25-hydroxycholesterol (5Cadigan K.M. Heider J.G. Chang T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 274-282Google Scholar). They were able to reverse this defect by transfection of human genomic DNA into the cells (6Cadigan K.M. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2201-2210Google Scholar). This eventually led to the isolation of a human cDNA encoding ACAT (4Chang C.C.Y. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Google Scholar). The protein turned out to be hydrophobic with areas of homology to other acyltransferases. Expression of this protein in insect Sf9 cells, which do not themselves express ACAT, yielded a high level of ACAT activity, confirming that the cDNA encoded the catalytic component (7Cheng D. Chang C.C.Y. Qu X. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 685-695Google Scholar). The AC29 cell line that Chang et al. (4Chang C.C.Y. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Google Scholar) used as a recipient in the cloning studies has two defects, 1) it lacks the ACAT enzyme (8Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29532-29540Google Scholar); and 2) it is resistant to feedback repression of cholesterol biosynthesis and LDL receptor activity by 25-hydroxycholesterol (5Cadigan K.M. Heider J.G. Chang T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 274-282Google Scholar, 6Cadigan K.M. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2201-2210Google Scholar). These two defects arose independently. The cells were first selected for 25-hydroxycholesterol resistance, and they were subsequently selected for ACAT deficiency (5Cadigan K.M. Heider J.G. Chang T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 274-282Google Scholar). The molecular nature of the mutation that abolishes ACAT expression and the nature of the defect that leads to a failure of 25-hydroxycholesterol regulation in AC29 cells are unknown. Our laboratory also isolated a mutant CHO cell line, designated SRD-4 cells, with the same two defects, 1) lack of ACAT activity; and 2) resistance to 25-hydroxycholesterol-mediated feedback regulation (9Metherall J.E. Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12734-12740Google Scholar). Although the SRD-4 cells emerged from a single step selection, we concluded that they also had two independent mutations because treatment of wild-type cells with an ACAT inhibitor blocked cholesterol esterification, but it did not reproduce the 25-hydroxycholesterol resistance phenotype (9Metherall J.E. Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

These proteins are synthesized as integral components of the membranes of the ER and nuclear envelope (12Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L.

Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Google Scholar). In sterol-depleted cells, a protease clips each protein to release an NH2-terminal fragment of ∼500 amino acids that contains a basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper motif and a transcription activating domain (12Wang X.

This fragment, designated the “mature” form of SREBP, enters the nucleus and binds to sterol regulatory elements in the enhancer regions of the genes encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase, an early enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, the LDL receptor (10Yokoyama C.

Binding leads to transcriptional activation, which allows cells to increase their rate of de novo cholesterol synthesis and uptake of cholesterol from LDL through LDL receptors (10Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Google Scholar, 11Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

SREBP-1 also activates transcription of the genes encoding acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase, two enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis (16Lopez J.M. Bennett M.K. Sanchez H.B.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Google Scholar). When LDL-derived cholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol overaccumulates in cells, the proteolysis of SREBPs is reduced, the proteins remain membrane-bound, and transcription of the target genes declines (10Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Google Scholar, 11Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad.

We previously described three mutant lines of CHO cells, designated SRD-1, −2, and −3 cells, that constitutively transcribe the genes encoding enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis and the LDL receptor (18Yang J. Sato R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1910-1919Google Scholar, 19Yang J. Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12152-12161Google Scholar, 20Metherall J.E.

Chem. 1991; 266: 9128-9134Google Scholar). These cells show virtually no suppression when 25-hydroxycholesterol is added. In contrast to the SRD-4 cells, the SRD-1, −2, and −3 cells have normal ACAT activity that is stimulated normally by LDL or 25-hydroxycholesterol (20Metherall J.E. Goldstein J.L. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15634-15641Google Scholar, 21Dawson P.A. Metherall J.E. Ridgway N.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9128-9134Google Scholar). The SRD-1, −2, and −3 cells have each undergone genomic recombinations that yield rearranged mRNAs encoding a truncated form of SREBP-2 that terminates before the membrane attachment domain (18Yang J. Sato R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1910-1919Google Scholar, 19Yang J. Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12152-12161Google Scholar). Because the truncated SREBP-2 is never attached to the membrane, it does not require proteolysis, and, therefore, it is always active; 25-hydroxycholesterol cannot suppress its activity. The SRD-4 cells, like the SRD-1, −2 and −3 cells, show nonregulated expression of the enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis and the LDL receptor (9Metherall J.E. Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12734-12740Google Scholar). We do not know whether the defect in these cells is caused by the production of a truncated form of SREBP. Moreover, we do not know the reason why these cells, in contrast to the SRD-1, −2 and −3 cells, lack ACAT activity. In the current experiments we have used the human cDNA clone of Chang et al. (4Chang C.C.Y. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Google Scholar) to isolate a cDNA encoding wild-type hamster ACAT. We have found that the SRD-4 cells produce a form of ACAT with a point mutation that changes a conserved amino acid and abolishes activity of the enzyme. We also show that the SRD-4 cells do not produce a truncated form of SREBP; rather, they continue to process both SREBP-1 and −2 to mature nuclear forms even in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol. Finally, we show that correction of the ACAT defect by transfection with wild-type ACAT fails to correct the regulatory response to 25-hydroxycholesterol in SRD-4 cells, confirming that these two abnormalities arose from independent mutations. We obtained HSV-Tag™ monoclonal antibody from Novagen. [14C]Oleate (55 mCi/mmol) and [14C]oleoyl-CoA (53mCi/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN. Standard molecular biology techniques were used (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed with the dideoxy chain termination method on an Applied Biosystems model 373A DNA sequencer. Probes were radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP by the random primer method using the Prime-It® II kit (Stratagene). Plasmids were prepared with Qiagen (midi or maxi prep) or Promega (mini prep) plasmid kits. CHO-7 and SRD-4 cells were described previously (9Metherall J.E. Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12734-12740Google Scholar). Expression plasmids for HSV-tagged human SREBP-1 and SREBP-2, designated pTK-HSV-BP1 and pTK-HSV-BP2, respectively, were described previously (14Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Google Scholar, 23Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10379-10384Google Scholar). Human LDL (d 1.019-1.063 g/ml) and newborn calf lipoprotein-deficient serum (d > 1.215 g/ml) were prepared as described previously (24Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Google Scholar). A λgt22A cDNA library from hamster SRD-2 cells (13Sato R. Yang J. Wang X. Evans M.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17267-17273Google Scholar) was screened with a 32P-labeled 1.8-kb BamHI/NotI cDNA fragment encoding human ACAT (4Chang C.C.Y. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Google Scholar) at 42°C overnight in 35% (v/v) formamide, 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 100 µg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 0.5% SDS. The blots were washed twice with 2 × SSC for 30 min at 50°C and once with 0.5 × SSC at 50°C. Among 5 × 105 plaques screened, four positive clones were identified. The clone with the longest insert, 3.0 kb, was subcloned into the pBK-CMV vector (Stratagene), sequenced on both strands, and subcloned into the CMV-driven, neo-containing expression vector pRc/CMV7SB (13Sato R. Yang J. Wang X. Evans M.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17267-17273Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid is designated pCMV-ACAT. Poly(A+) RNA was isolated with oligo(dT) cellulose (Stratagene) and loaded onto a 1.5% agarose gel in 40 mM MOPS. After electrophoresis at 50 mA for 4 h at room temperature, the RNAs were transferred overnight onto Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Corp.) in 20 × SSC, cross-linked with UV light, prehybridized for 30 min, and hybridized for 2 h at 65°C in Rapid-hyb Buffer (Amersham Corp.) with a 32P-labeled 1.6-kb PCR fragment corresponding to the coding region of the hamster ACAT cDNA (1 × 106 cpm/ml). The blot was washed at room temperature with 2 × SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS for 20 min, and 0.5 × SSC/0.1% SDS twice at 65°C for 20 min, followed by autoradiography. Genomic DNA was isolated from CHO-7 and SRD-4 cells with a DNA Extraction Kit (Stratagene). Aliquots of DNA (10 µg) were digested with restriction enzymes at 37°C for 2 h and subjected to electrophoresis on a 0.7% agarose gel. The DNAs were transferred to Hybond-N+ membranes, cross-linked with UV light, and blotted with 1 × 106 cpm/ml of the 32P-labeled 1.6-kb hamster ACAT probe (see above) in Rapid-hyb Buffer. The blot was then washed twice with 0.2 × SSC at 42°C, followed by autoradiography. To detect mutations in the hamster ACAT mRNA in SRD-4 cells, poly(A+) RNA from SRD-4 and CHO-7 cells was reverse-transcribed with the Stratascript™ reverse transcription-PCR Kit (Stratagene). The resulting RNA/DNA hybrids from each cell line were used as templates with [32P]dCTP in eight separate PCR reactions that were designed to cover the entire 1.6-kb coding region of hamster ACAT. The resulting eight 32P-labeled PCR products spanning the ACAT cDNA in both CHO-7 and SRD-4 cells were then subjected to SSCP analysis as described (25Orita M. Suzuki Y. Sekiya T. Hayashi K. Genomics. 1989; 5: 874-879Google Scholar). One of the PCR products in the region of codon 265 gave an abnormal pattern in the SSCP analysis. To localize the mutation in this region, we subjected SRD-4 mRNA to PCR with primers from the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the ACAT mRNA. A specific primer corresponding to codons 201–208 was used to sequence this region of the PCR product. In vitro mutagenesis was done with a Muta-gene M13 In Vitro Mutagenesis Kit (Bio-Rad). A point mutation (Ser → Leu) at amino acid residue 265 in the wild-type ACAT cDNA was produced using a 27-base pair mutagenic oligonucleotide, 5′-CTCTCTGACAAACAAGTGAGCCTTCAT-3′. The replication form DNA of the mutant cDNA (cloned in M13mp 19) was digested with SalI and NotI, and the insert was subcloned into pRc/CMV7SB (13Sato R. Yang J. Wang X. Evans M.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17267-17273Google Scholar). This plasmid was designated pCMV-ACAT(S265L). The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Monolayers of human embryonic kidney 293 cells were set up on day 0 at 4 × 105 cells/60-mm dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with low glucose supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. After incubation for 48 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator, the cells were transfected with the wild-type or mutant pCMV-ACAT plasmid using a MBS Transfection Kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation for 3 h at 35°C in a 3% CO2 incubator, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, refed with fresh medium containing 10% newborn calf lipoprotein-deficient serum (medium A), returned to a 37°C/5% CO2 incubator, and used for experiments 16 h later. Cells were seeded on day 0 at a density of 5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 5% newborn calf lipoprotein-deficient serum and transfected on day 1 with 5 µg of hamster wild-type pCMV-ACAT using the MBS Transfection Kit as described above. Stable transformants from two dishes were selected by growth in medium supplemented with 700 µg/ml G418. G418-resistant colonies were picked and screened for incorporation of [14C]oleate into cholesteryl [14C]oleate by intact monolayers (see below). Positive colonies were cloned by dilution plating and rescreened. Four clones that stably expressed ACAT were isolated, and one of these, designated Tr. 10–9, was used for experiments. Protein concentrations were measured with a BCA kit (Pierce). After SDS electrophoresis in a 12% gel, the proteins were transferred to Hybond-C extra transfer membrane (Amersham Corp.). Immunoblot analysis was carried out with Enhanced Chemiluminescence Western blotting Detection Kit (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications (14Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Google Scholar, 23Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10379-10384Google Scholar). Filters were exposed to Reflection™ NEF film (DuPont). Immunodetection of hamster ACAT was carried out with 10 µg/ml rabbit polyclonal antibody (IgG fraction) directed against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids 1–140 of hamster ACAT. Immunodetection of endogenous hamster SREBP-1 and −2 was carried out with 3 µg/ml monoclonal IgG-2A4 (13Sato R. Yang J. Wang X. Evans M.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17267-17273Google Scholar) and 5 µg/ml monoclonal IgG-7D4 (19Yang J. Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12152-12161Google Scholar). Immunodetection of transfected HSV-tagged human SREBP-1 and −2 was carried out with 0.5 µg/ml of HSV-Tag™ monoclonal antibody (14Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Google Scholar, 23Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10379-10384Google Scholar). The rate of incorporation of [14C]oleate into cholesteryl [14C]oleate and [14C]triglycerides by intact cell monolayers was measured as described previously (24Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Google Scholar). ACAT activity in membranes from cell extracts was assayed by measuring the rate of conversion of [1-14C]oleoyl-CoA to cholesteryl [14C]oleate as described previously (3Brown M.S. Dana S.E. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4025-4027Google Scholar, 9Metherall J.E. Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12734-12740Google Scholar) with several modifications. The 2,000 × g cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (50 mM potassium phosphate and 2 mM dithiothreitol at pH 7.4), homogenized by 10 passages through a 25-gauge needle, and subjected to centrifugation at 105× g for 1 h at 4°C to yield a total cell membrane fraction. This fraction was suspended in buffer A. Membrane fractions (25–100 µg of protein) were incubated in a final volume of 0.2 ml for 20 min at 37°C in buffer A containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, followed by incubation for 20 min at 37°C with 10 µg/ml cholesterol (added in 2 µl of ethanol). [14C]Oleoyl-CoA (20 dpm/pmol) was then added to a final concentration of 75 µM, and the incubations were continued for 1 h at 37°C. Reactions were terminated by addition of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) continued 20,000 dpm [3H]cholesteryl oleate as a recovery control. Neutral lipids were extracted and resolved by thin layer chromatography as described previously (24Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Google Scholar). We isolated a cDNA encoding hamster ACAT by probing a λgt22A cDNA library prepared from SRD-2 cells (13Sato R. Yang J. Wang X. Evans M.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17267-17273Google Scholar), a line of CHO cells that has high ACAT activity, owing to overproduction of cholesterol as a result of a dominant positive mutation in SREBP-2 (19Yang J. Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12152-12161Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that the amino acid sequence of hamster ACAT, as deduced from the cDNA sequence, is 88 and 92% identical to the human and mouse homologues, respectively. The hamster and mouse proteins are each slightly shorter than the human sequence (546 and 540 amino acids, respectively, versus 550 amino acids), owing to deletions of blocks of four or six residues. Fig. 2 shows a Northern blot showing that the wild-type CHO-7 cells and the SRD-4 cells each produced a single ACAT mRNA of ∼3 kb (Fig. 2). The relative abundance was similar in the two cell lines, but a 2-fold difference could not have been detected by this technique. To search for a point mutation in the ACAT mRNA in SRD-4 cells, we made a cDNA copy of the mRNA with reverse transcriptase, and then we used oligonucleotide primers with [32P]dCTP to amplify by PCR eight overlapping segments that covered the entire 1.6-kb coding region. The PCR products were denatured and subjected to electrophoresis in nondenaturing gels so as to detect single-strand conformational polymorphisms (SSCPs) (25Orita M. Suzuki Y. Sekiya T. Hayashi K. Genomics. 1989; 5: 874-879Google Scholar). Seven of the amplified fragments were identical for the cDNAs from CHO-7 and SRD-4 cells (data not shown). The eighth fragment consistently showed a slight mobility difference between the two cell strains (Fig. 3). After denaturation, both strands of the SRD-4 cDNA (lane 4) were displaced relative to the CHO-7 strands (lane 3), and there was no evidence of any wild-type strands. To identify the putative point mutation in the SRD-4 ACAT, the entire coding region of the mRNA was PCR-amplified, and the DNA sequence in the region of the abnormal SSCP was determined. This sequence showed a single nucleotide abnormality (C → T) at the central position of codon 265, changing the amino acid from Ser to Leu. The sequence of the PCR product showed only a T and no C at this position, indicating that the SRD-4 cells produced only the abnormal species of mRNA and none of the normal transcript (data from automated sequencer not shown). It is noted that Ser-265 is conserved in ACAT from all three known species (asterisk in Fig. 1). To confirm the mutation in the SRD-4 mRNA, we cloned the entire PCR-amplified coding region of the mRNA into a TA vector and isolated 9 independent recombinant plasmids (Table I). The DNA sequence of each of these plasmids was determined in the region of codon 265, and all of them showed the C → T change.Table IClonal analysis of PCR products amplified from ACAT mRNA and genomic DNA from SRD-4 cellsTemplate for PCRDNA sequence at codon 265Wild-type TCG (Ser)Mutant TTG (Leu)number of PCR clonesPoly(A+) RNA09Genomic DNA22 Open table in a new tab The data from the SSCP analysis (Fig. 3), the direct sequencing of the PCR product, and the subsequent analysis of cDNA clones (Table I) all indicated that the SRD-4 cells produced only the mutant form of the mRNA. To analyze the situation at the genomic level, we PCR-amplified the region of the gene containing codon 265 and cloned the products into a plasmid vector. Four independent colonies were isolated, and the plasmids were subjected to sequencing. Two of these plasmids showed the wild-type sequence at codon 265 (TCG), and the other two showed the mutant sequence (TTG) (Table I). We conclude that the SRD-4 cells are compound heterozygotes. One allele contains a C → T substitution at codon 265 and produces a mutant ACAT mRNA. The second allele contains a wild-type sequence at codon 265, but it is a silent allele that is not transcribed into mRNA. Southern blots of genomic DNA, probed with the full-length cDNA, failed to reveal an abnormal fragment in the SRD-4 gene after digestion with several restriction enzymes, indicating that the silent allele does not have a gross deletion or rearrangement (data not shown). Using techniques of in vitro mutagenesis, we introduced the C → T mutation at codon 265 into the full-length wild-type cDNA (S265L mutant). To visualize the ACAT protein, we prepared a polyclonal rabbit antibody against a fusion protein containing amino acids 1–140 of hamster ACAT. Fig. 4 shows that this antibody failed to detect a protein in the size range of ACAT (50 kDa) (8Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29532-29540Google Scholar) on immunoblotting of extracts of human 293 cells when the cells were incubated either in the absence or presence of sterols (lanes 1 and 2, respectively). When the 293 cells were transfected with a cDNA encoding wild-type hamster ACAT under control of the CMV promoter, a band in the correct size range was detected, and this was not altered by the addition of sterols (lanes 5 and 6). Transfection of the mutant cDNA produced a much lighter band (lanes 3 and 4). This experiment was replicated several times, and we interpreted it to indicate that the S265L mutation renders the protein unstable. To determine whether the S265L mutant has enzymatic activity, we transfected 293 cells with 5 µg of mutant ACAT plasmid and 1 µg of wild-type plasmid so as to obtain approximately the same amount of protein (see immunoblot in Fig. 5). The cells were lysed, a membrane pellet was prepared, and ACAT activity was measured with varying amounts of membranes using [14C]oleoyl-CoA and unlabeled cholesterol as substrates. Membranes from 293 cells transfected with an empty vector had endogenous ACAT activity (open triangles, Fig. 5). Transfection with 1 µg of wild-type ACAT cDNA led to a severalfold increase in enzyme activity (closed symbols). In contrast, transfection with 5 µg of the mutant cDNA produced no detectable increase over the endogenous activity (open triangles). Similar results were obtained in four separate experiments. We conclude that the S265L mutant of hamster ACAT is both unstable and inactive. We next conducted studies to determine whether the ACAT defect in SRD-4 cells causes the defect in sterol-mediated inhibition of the cleavage of SREBPs and whether this latter defect would be corrected by correction of the ACAT defect. For this purpose, we transfected the wild-type ACAT cDNA into SRD-4 cells under control of the CMV promoter and isolated a permanent line of SRD-4 cells, designated Tr.10-9, that expresses the wild-type enzyme. Table II shows that monolayers of CHO-7 cells incorporated [14C]oleate into cholesteryl [14C]oleate and that the reaction was stimulated by addition of sterols in the form of 25-hydroxycholesterol plus LDL. The SRD-4 cells synthesized only a trace amount of cholesteryl [14C]oleate and there was no stimulation by sterols. The Tr.10-9 cells had a 2-fold increased rate of cholesteryl [14C]oleate synthesis in the absence of sterols, and the rate rose to the same level as CHO-7 cells in the presence of sterols. Similar results were obtained in several independent experiments. None of these manipulations affected the incorporation of [14C]oleate into [14C]triglycerides (Table II).Table IISRD-4 cells stably transfected with wild-type hamster ACAT cDNACell line[14C]Oleate incorporated intoCholesteryl [14C]oleate[14C]Triglycerides−Sterols+Sterols−Sterols+Sterolspmol · h−1· mg protein−1CHO-7871718275,89088,827SRD-49010871,00171,081Transfected clone Tr.10-92131665260,12953,176 Open table in a new tab To assess the sterol-regulated cleavage of SREBPs, we incubated cells in the presence of lipoprotein-deficient serum plus varying concentrations of 25-hydroxycholesterol for 16 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to electrophoresis and immunoblotting with antibodies against SREBP-1 or −2 (Fig. 6). CHO-7 cells incubated in the absence of lipoproteins had detectable amounts of SREBP-1 and −2 in the nucleus (lane 1, upper and lower panels). The size of the protein was consistent with the known size of the transcriptionally active NH2-terminal fragment. Addition of 0.1 µg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol markedly reduced the amount of this nuclear fragment, and the protein virtually disappeared at 0.3 µg/ml (lanes 2 and 3). The SRD-4 cells also exhibited nuclear forms of SREBP-1 and −2, but neither protein was reduced when the cells were incubated with 25-hydroxycholesterol at concentrations as high as 1 µg/ml, which was 10-fold higher than the concentration that produced a detectable decrease in the CHO-7 cells (lanes 5–8). This defect in sterol-mediated regulation persisted in the Tr.10-9 cells (lanes 9–12). The experiment of Fig. 6 indicates that the loss of sterol-mediated regulation of SREBP processing in SRD-4 cells is not caused by the loss of ACAT activity. However, the experiment does not rule out the possibility that the regulatory defect is caused by some dominant property of the mutant ACAT enzyme. To rule out this possibility, we introduced expressible cDNAs encoding wild-type or S265L mutant ACAT into 293 cells by transient transfection together with expression plasmids encoding epitope-tagged versions of SREBP-1 or −2. The cells were incubated in the absence or presence of sterols (Fig. 7). Nuclear extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against the epitope tag on SREBP-1 or −2. The nuclear forms of both SREBPs were down-regulated by sterols whether the cells were transfected with an empty vector (lanes 1 and 2), a vector encoding wild-type ACAT (lanes 3 and 4), or the S265L mutant of ACAT (lanes 5 and 6). Thus, there was no evidence that the S265L mutant interfered with the sterol-mediated regulation of processing of SREBPs. The current data indicate that the SRD-4 cells contain at least three independent defects as follows: 1) a mutant allele at the ACAT locus that contains a C → T substitution, changing codon 265 from serine to leucine and producing an inactive enzyme; 2) a silent allele at the other ACAT locus that does not produce mRNA; and 3) a mutation at an unknown locus that prevents 25-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol from inhibiting the cleavage of SREBP-1 and −2. All of these abnormalities appear to have arisen independently, and all of them act together to allow the SRD-4 cells to survive selection in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol. The amino acid substitution in the ACAT protein reduces activity by two mechanisms. 1) It reduces the amount of ACAT protein, most likely because the mutant protein is unstable. 2) It severely reduces the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The first abnormality became manifest when we transfected 293 cells with a cDNA encoding the S265L mutant ACAT and found that it produced much lower levels of protein than the cDNA encoding the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4). We were unable to measure the amount of ACAT protein in the SRD-4 cells themselves because our current antibodies do not have the requisite sensitivity, but we suspect that these cells must also have a reduced level of ACAT protein. The second abnormality was manifest when we transfected 293 cells with a 5-fold excess of plasmid encoding the mutant form of ACAT as compared with the wild-type form so as to obtain approximately equal levels of ACAT protein (Fig. 5). Although the amount of protein was similar, membranes from the cells transfected with the mutant cDNA failed to show an increase in ACAT activity, whereas membranes from cells transfected with the wild-type cDNA showed a clear increase. The most likely explanation for the silent ACAT allele in the SRD-4 cells is that this allele is in a region of a chromosome that is heavily methylated. Many genes in CHO cells are heavily methylated and thereby silenced from expression leaving the cells functionally hemizygous at many loci (reviewed in 26Holliday R. Mutat. Res. 1991; 250: 351-363Google Scholar and 27Holliday R. Ho T. New Biol. 1990; 2: 719-726Google Scholar). The third abnormality in the SRD-4 cells, namely an inability of 25-hydroxycholesterol to suppress cleavage of either SREBP-1 or −2, is so far unique. In previous studies of three independent CHO cell lines that were selected for 25-hydroxycholesterol resistance, we found that each one produced a truncated form of SREBP-2 that terminated at amino acid 460 and was therefore constitutively active (18Yang J. Sato R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1910-1919Google Scholar, 19Yang J. Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12152-12161Google Scholar). Whereas the mature form of SREBP-2 was found in the nucleus under all conditions, only trace amounts of SREBP-1 were found there, owing to an apparent down-regulation of the cleavage of SREBP-1 by the truncated SREBP-2 (18Yang J. Sato R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1910-1919Google Scholar, 19Yang J. Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12152-12161Google Scholar). The situation with the SRD-4 cells is markedly different. In these cells we find approximately equal amounts of the cleaved forms of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 in the nucleus under inducing conditions, and neither is suppressed when 25-hydroxycholesterol is added (Fig. 6). It is likely that the SRD-4 cells have a mutation in a gene whose product is necessary for sterol-mediated inhibition of proteolysis of both SREBPs. This putative protein is not ACAT because correction of the ACAT deficiency by transfection of the wild-type ACAT cDNA failed to correct the regulatory abnormality (Fig. 6). We also considered the possibility that the point mutation in ACAT might produce a dominant effect that prevented 25-hydroxycholesterol from regulating proteolysis of SREBPs. Against this hypothesis is the experiment of Fig. 7, which shows that cleavage of epitope-tagged SREBPs is regulated normally in 293 cells that have been transfected with a cDNA encoding the S265L ACAT mutant. An interesting sidelight to these studies is the observation of a high basal rate of cholesteryl ester synthesis in SRD-4 cells transfected with the wild-type ACAT cDNA (Table II). The rate was more than 2-fold above normal when the cells were deprived of exogenous sterols, and it was equal to normal when the reaction was stimulated with 25-hydroxycholesterol and LDL. The high rate of esterification in the absence of sterols is most likely due to a high rate of cholesterol synthesis, owing to the defect in feedback suppression. Previous studies with SRD-1, −2, and −3 cells showed that these cells also have a high rate of cholesterol synthesis and esterification in the absence of exogenous cholesterol (20Metherall J.E. Goldstein J.L. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15634-15641Google Scholar, 21Dawson P.A. Metherall J.E. Ridgway N.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9128-9134Google Scholar). Presumably the sterol feedback regulatory system operates to some degree even in the absence of exogenous sterol, and this is abolished in the sterol-resistant cells. It is of interest that the only two cell lines so far described with ACAT deficiency both have concurrent defects in sterol regulation of transcription. These are the SRD-4 cells of the current paper and the AC29 cells of Cadigan et al. (5Cadigan K.M. Heider J.G. Chang T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 274-282Google Scholar, 6Cadigan K.M. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2201-2210Google Scholar). This coincidence raises the possibility that the defects in ACAT and the defect in sterol regulation somehow interact to improve survival of cells in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol. It is straightforward to rationalize how an ACAT deficiency might help cells resist killing by 25-hydroxycholesterol (9Metherall J.E. Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12734-12740Google Scholar). The sterol kills cells by suppressing the cleavage of SREBPs, thereby preventing transcription of genes encoding LDL receptors and enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. The resultant cholesterol deficiency is made worse because 25-hydroxycholesterol also activates ACAT, which esterifies some of the residual free cholesterol, preventing it from being used for membrane synthesis. A deficiency in ACAT would ameliorate this problem partially by abolishing esterification of cholesterol, thereby making more cholesterol available for membrane function. We thank T. Y. Chang for providing the human ACAT cDNA; our colleagues Juro Sakai, Jianxin Yang, and Helen Hobbs for helpful comments; Gloria Brunschede for excellent technical assistance; Michelle Laremore and Jeff Cormier for DNA sequencing; and Jacqueline Le and Lisa Beatty for invaluable help with tissue culture."

The mechanisms by which RA exerts its actions are not fully understood, but several classes of proteins involved in mediating the cellular response to RA have been identified. These cellular mediators include at least two families of nuclear retinoid receptors (RARs and RXRs) and two cellular retinoic acid-binding proteins (CRABPI and CRABPII). The nuclear receptors are members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily and act as high affinity ligand-dependent transcription factors (20Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P.

In this study, the regulatory properties of a 696-base pair region, that contains the promoter II and is situated immediately upstream of exon II of the human aromatase gene, were investigated. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) functional studies with DNA segments derived from this genomic region and primer-extension analysis revealed the presence of a second promoter which is functional in adipose stromal cells and in breast cancer cells. Detailed DNase-1 footprinting analysis, DNA mobility shift assays, and CAT functional studies of this genomic region were performed and led to the identification of a segment (B1) that could act as a promoter (probably promoter I.3) in adipose stromal and breast cancer cells. The study revealed further that the B1 region could be divided into two domains which were designated RE1 and RE2. RE1 was found to have the promoter activity, and RE2 was found to regulate the promoter activity of RE1, but in different manners in MCF-7 cells (as an example of breast cancer cells) and in adipose stromal cells. RE2 was found to function as a positive regulatory element in MCF-7 cells and as a negative regulatory element in adipose stromal cells, respectively. DNA mobility shift and UV-cross-linking experiments with BrUrd-substituted B1 fragment and nuclear extracts isolated from two types of cells were performed.

Alkalinization of the extracellular space occurred concomitantly with <i>myo</i>-inositol influx. Correlation of membrane currents with radiolabeled <i>myo</i>-inositol flux revealed that one positive charge is translocated with each molecule of <i>myo</i>-inositol, consistent with cotransport of one proton. The transport concentration dependence on both species suggested ordered binding of a proton followed by a molecule of <i>myo</i>-inositol. In the absence of <i>myo</i>-inositol, a voltage-dependent capacitance was observed that correlated with the transporter expression level. This charge movement obeyed a Boltzmann function, which was used to estimate a turnover of 0.70 ± 0.06 s<sup>−1</sup> at −60 mV. The pH and voltage dependence of the charge movements were simulated with a model involving alternating access of internal and external protons to sites within an occluded pore."

We have used ethanol to block the production of phospholipase D (PLD)-derived PA and DG (from PA hydrolysis) to study their role in signal transduction. In MDCK cells, TPA-stimulated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis was inhibited by ethanol at concentrations which inhibit PA and DG formation. In addition, TPA elicited a prolonged increase in PGE2 synthesis that is dependent upon continuous activation of PLD. The TPA-stimulated translocation of protein kinase Cα (PKCα) from cytosol to membrane was unaffected by ethanol. This suggests that PLD-derived products act downstream of PKC in TPA-stimulated prostaglandin synthesis. The calcium ionophore, A23187, did not activate PLD, and PGE2 synthesis in response to A23187 was unaffected by ethanol. TPA increased prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase (PGHS) activity and increased the amount of immunodetectable prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase 2 (PGHS-2). A23187 did not induce PGHS-2 and A23187-stimulated PGE2 synthesis appears to be due to the constitutively expressed PGHS-1. Blocking the formation of PLD-derived products, PA and DG, inhibited the induction of PGHS-2 by TPA. These results indicate that prolonged PGE2 synthesis in response to TPA is due to the continuous induction of PGHS-2, which is dependent upon PLD activation. In contrast, induction of PGHS-2 by epidermal growth factor was not affected by ethanol. Epidermal growth factor did not induce PKCα translocation nor activate PLD. Taken together, these data suggest that PLD-derived PA or DG act as second messengers in the induction of PGHS-2 by PKC-dependent pathways.

The half-life of RHAMM mRNA was increased by 3 fold in cells treated with TGF-β<sub>1</sub>, indicating that growth factor regulation of RHAMM gene expression at least in part involves a posttranscriptional mechanism. Our studies demonstrated that a unique 30-nucleotide (nt) region that has three copies of the sequence, GCUUGC, was the TGF-β<sub>1</sub>-responsive region in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) that mediated message stability. This region interacted specifically with cytoplasmic <i>trans</i>-factors to form multiple protein complexes of approximately 175, 97, 63, 26, and 17 kDa post-TGF-β<sub>1</sub> treatment, suggesting a role for these complexes in the mechanism of action of TGF-β<sub>1</sub>-induced message stabilization. Insertion of the 3′-UTR into the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene conferred TGF-β<sub>1</sub> induced stability of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-hybrid RNA in stably transfected cells, while the same insert carrying a deletion containing the 30-nt region had no significant effect on mRNA stability. These results provide a model of RHAMM message regulation in which TGF-β<sub>1</sub>-mediated alteration of RHAMM message stability involves the up-regulation of multiple protein interactions with a 30-nt <i>cis</i>-element stability determinant in the 3′-UTR. This model also suggests that this 30-nt base region functions in <i>cis</i> to destabilize RHAMM mRNA in resting normal cells."

In vitro, purified NFL can self-assemble into filaments of normal morphology, whereas NFM and NFH only form irregular filamentous aggregates.

Hajarian H. Tran T. Alipourjeddi P. Noveen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9334-9339Google Scholar). For keratins, which are heteropolymers of a type I and a type II keratin, the first step of assembly is the formation of a heterodimer. The type III IF proteins (vimentin, desmin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and peripherin), which self-assemble in vitro as well as in vivo, form homodimers in the first step of polymerization, although heterodimers between different type III IF proteins can also be formed (14Steinert P.M. Idler W.W. Cabral F. Gottesman M.M. Goldman R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3692-3696Google Scholar, 15van den Heuvel R.M.M. van Eys G.J.J.M. Ramaekers F.C.S. Quaz W.J. Vree Egberts W.T.M. Schaart G. Cuypers H.T.M. J. Cell Sci. 1987; 88: 475-482Google Scholar). As to the NFTPs, there is evidence for the existence of tetramers that contain mixtures of NFL and NFM (13Cohlberg J.A. Hajarian H. Tran T. Alipourjeddi P. Noveen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9334-9339Google Scholar); however, there is not yet any conclusive evidence as to the identity of the first-formed dimer. This dimer can be a homodimer, a heterodimer, or both. In the case of NFL, which can self-assemble in vitro, one would expect that it is able to form homodimers. In the formation of copolymers of NFL and NFM (or NFH), either homodimers of NFM (or NFH) or heterodimers of NFL/NFM (or NFL/NFH) could be formed, which could then interact with NFL homodimers to form filaments. Although there is no direct evidence indicating that NFL/NFM or NFL/NFH heterodimers can be formed, the results of an antibody labeling study of bovine neurofilaments suggested the possible formation of heterodimers of NFL with NFM or NFH (16Mulligan L. Balin B.J. Lee V.M.-Y. Ip W. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 106: 145-160Google Scholar). This study showed that an epitope in the NFL tail, which was accessible in NFL homopolymers, was masked in native filaments. This phenomenon can be explained by the hypothesis that NFL/NFM and NFL/NFH heterodimers are the initial building blocks in native NFs. The elucidation of this first step of NFTP polymerization is important because it will help explain the detailed arrangement of the protein chains within the neurofilament. To determine if the NFTPs preferentially form homodimers or heterodimers, one would like to be able to compare the relative affinities of an NFTP monomer for its own kind and for other NFTP monomers. However, these studies are confounded by the difficulty of stopping the polymerization at the dimerization step. In order to circumvent this problem, we have employed the yeast two-hybrid system to measure the relative strengths of the NFTPs to interact with their own kind and with each other, as well as with vimentin. For each transformation, yeast strain SFY526 (MATα, ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, lys2-801, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, canr, gal4-542, gal80-538, URA3::GAL1-lacZ) was grown and manipulated according to the MATCHMAKER Two-Hybrid System protocol (Clontech). Briefly, the two-hybrid vectors were co-transformed into the yeast cells by lithium acetate method, and the transformants were selected on the minus Trp-Leu synthetic dropout synthetic plates for 4 days at 30°C. All cDNAs were cloned into plasmids, pGBT9 and pGAD424 (Clontech), using standard molecular biology techniques (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The plasmid constructs, pGBT-NFL24-542 and pGAD-NFL24-542 (generously provided by Dr. S. Chin, Columbia University), respectively encoded for the GAL4 DNA binding and activation domain fused to the rat NFL from amino acid 24 to 542. To construct pGBT-NFL24-415 and pGAD-NFL24-415, the 0.5-kb SacI-SalI fragment was removed from pGBT-NFL24-542 and pGAD-NFL24-542; the resulting linearized plasmid DNAs were purified and blunted before setting up for self-ligation. The pGBT-NFL1-415 was made by replacing the 1-kb SmaI-KpnI fragment of pGBT-NFL24-415 with the 1.1-kb BglI (blunted)-KpnI fragment of pRSVi-NFL (8Chin S.S.M. Liem R.K.H. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3714-3726Google Scholar). The 1.3-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment of the resulting pGBT-NFL1-415 construct was then cloned into pGAD424 to create pGAD-NFL1-415. To clone pGBT-NFM and pGAD-NFM, a 2.6-kb blunted EcoRI fragment containing the full-length rat NFM cDNA was isolated from pNFM2D (18Napolitano E.W. Chin S.S.M. Colman D.R. Liem R.K.H. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2590-2599Google Scholar) and was inserted at the SmaI site of the pGBT9 and pGAD424. For construction of pGBT-NFM1-421 and pGAD-NFM1-421, the 1.2-kb SacII-HindIII (blunted) fragment from M1-421 (6Chin S.S.M. Liem R.K.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 50: 475-490Google Scholar) was used to replace the 2.5-kb SacII-BamHI (blunted) fragment of pGBT-NFM and pGAD-NFM. In order to create another frame for cloning, pGBT9 and pGAD424 were allowed to self-ligate after filling in the EcoRI-digested ends by Klenow. The new vectors were designated as pΔGBT9 and pΔGAD424. To make pGBT-NFM44-421 and pGAD-NFM44-421, the 1.2-kb SacII (blunted)-SalI fragments of pGBT-NFM1-421 and pGAD-NFM1-421 were ligated to SmaI-SalI-digested pΔGBT9 and pΔGAD424. For cloning of pGBT-NFH and pGAD-NFH, the 3.4-kb NotI (blunted)-BamHI fragment encoding the entire rat NFH was isolated from pGEM3-NFH (8Chin S.S.M. Liem R.K.H. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3714-3726Google Scholar) and ligated to the SmaI-BamHI-digested pGBT9 and pGAD424. To obtain the pGBT-NFH1-415 and pGAD-NFH1-415, the 2-kb Tth111I-BamHI fragments were removed from pGBT-NFH and pGAD-NFH; the linear plasmid DNAs were purified, blunted, and set up for self-ligation. To generate pGBT-Vim and pGAD-Vim, the BstBI (blunted)-BamHI fragment of pGEM-Vim (6Chin S.S.M. Liem R.K.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 50: 475-490Google Scholar) carrying the rat vimentin cDNA was cloned into the SmaI-BamHI-digested pGBT-9 and pGAD424. All plasmids were sequenced to ascertain reading frame with Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Interactions of proteins in the two-hybrid system can be monitored both qualitatively and quantitatively. Filter lift assays were performed for the qualitative measurement of β-galactosidase activity. Transformed yeast colonies were patched onto filters layered over minus Trp-Leu synthetic dropout synthetic agar plates overnight at 30°C. Filters were submerged in liquid nitrogen for 10 s and placed on other filters that were presoaked in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactoside solution containing 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 10 mM KCl, and 1 mM MgSO4. Filters were then incubated at 30°C and periodically examined for the appearance of blue colonies. Quantitative assays were performed on liquid cultures. Cultures of 2.0 ml were grown to mid-log phase in minus Trp-Leu media. Cells were spun and resuspended into 0.5 ml of 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, and 50 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, and 50 µl of CHCl3 and SDS were added to permeabilize the cells. 100 µl of Chlorophenol red-β-D-galactopyranoside solution (4 mg/ml in 0.1 M phosphate buffer) was used as the substrate. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30°C for 1–2 h and finally quenched by adding 0.25 ml of 1 M Na2CO3. A β-galactosidase unit is defined as 103× A574/min of reaction for 1 ml of culture at 1 A600 unit (19Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The reported results were means and standard deviations of four independent transformants. In this study, we have utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to characterize the interactions between the NFTPs. The mechanism of the system has been described by Fields and Song in detail (20Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-247Google Scholar) and takes advantage of the properties of the GAL4 protein of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In essence, the two domains necessary for transcriptional activation are separated into a GAL4 DNA binding domain and an activation domain. Various proteins are then expressed either as a hybrid with the GAL4 DNA binding domain or with the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain. The ability of two proteins to interact can then be determined by co-transformation into a yeast strain, which contains an integrated copy of a GAL1-LacZ indicator gene. If the two proteins interact, the two domains of GAL4 are brought into close physical proximity and allow activation of transcription from the lacZ gene, whose gene product can be readily detected. The cDNAs encoding amino acids 24–542 of NFL, as well as the full-length NFH and NFM, were cloned into the pGBT9 and pGAD424 vectors. Since the assembly of NFL from which the amino-terminal 23 amino acids are deleted was comparable with that of the full-length NFL in transfected fibroblasts (21Chin S.S.M. Macioce P. Liem R.K.H. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 335-350Google Scholar), we assumed that the interaction strengths of the NFL24-542 hybrids would also be comparable with the full-length NFL hybrids. Different combinations of the NFTP hybrid constructs were co-transformed into the yeast strain SFY526 and selected on the minus Trp-Leu synthetic dropout synthetic plates for 4 days. Interactions between the hybrid proteins were determined by filter assays measuring the β-galactosidase activities of transformed yeast colonies, and the results are summarized in Table I. None of the NFTP-containing chimeric proteins showed nonspecific activation of the lacZ reporter gene. β-Galactosidase activity could readily be detected when GAL4 transcriptional activation hybrids of NFL24-542 were co-transformed with GAL4 DNA binding hybrids of NFL24-542, NFM, and NFH, indicating the interactions of NFL with NFL, NFM, and NFH. Surprisingly, even though both NFH and NFM contain rod domains that potentially interact, they did not interact with themselves or with each other in the two-hybrid system.Table IInteractions between NFTPs with each other and with vimentin on β-galatosidase filter assayspGAD424pGBT9EmptyNFHNFMNFL24-542VimentinEmpty−−−−−NFH−−−−++NFM−−−−++NFL24-542−+++++++++++Vimentin−++++ Open table in a new tab When the hybrid combinations for NFL, NFM, and NFH were reversed, i.e. GAL4 transcriptional activation hybrids of NFM or NFH were co-transformed with GAL4 DNA binding hybrids of NFL24-542, no β-galactosidase activity could be detected on filters. In order to determine whether this inconsistency was due to the lack of expression or improper folding of the activation domain-fused NFM and NFH, we also tested for their interactions with vimentin. We reasoned that since each of the NFTPs co-assembles with vimentin in transfected fibroblasts (9Ching G.Y. Liem R.K.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1323-1335Google Scholar, 10Lee M.K. Xu Z. Wong P.C. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1337-1350Google Scholar), it was possible that these proteins would interact to form a heterodimer with vimentin in the yeast two-hybrid system. As shown in Table I, all of the NFTPs hybrids interacted with vimentin, although stronger interactions were detected when vimentin was expressed as a hybrid with the GAL4 DNA binding domain. The discrepancy of the results due to switching the vectors may indicate that the GAD-vimentin hybrid is less well expressed than the GBT-vimentin hybrid. A lower level of expression of GAD-vimentin could also account for the apparently stronger interactions between GBT-vimentin and the GAD-NFTP hybrids than between GBT-vimentin and GAD-vimentin. In any case, our results imply that interactions of NFL with NFL, NFM, and NFH can occur, and in addition each of the NFTPs can interact with vimentin. The lack of interactions between NFM and NFH with themselves and the interactions observed between the GAD-NFL hybrid with the GBT-NFM and GBT-NFH hybrid are consistent with the tentative conclusion that NFL/NFM and NFL/NFH heterodimers are formed in preference to NFM/NFM and NFH/NFH homodimers; however, this conclusion is tempered, because GBT-NFL did not interact with GAD-NFM or GAD-NFH. One problem with the previous results may be that the large size of the NFH and NFM tails in the hybrids may interfere with the activation of transcription of the lacZ reporter gene resulting in the lack of detection of their self-interactions by the β-galactosidase assay. To eliminate this possibility, we constructed tailless NFTPs in pGBT9 and pGAD424 to characterize all the possible interactions in dimer formation between the NFTPs. The tailless NFL (LΔ) and NFH (HΔ) constructs contained cDNA of rat NFL and NFH from amino acids 1 to 415 and the tailless NFM construct (MΔ) coded for amino acids 1–421. All the different combinations of the tailless constructs were co-transformed into yeast cells, and the interactions were monitored both by the filter assays and the liquid β-galactosidase assays. Yeast that had been co-transformed with combinations of hybrids containing NFTPs turned blue quickly after being permeabilized on filters, indicating that the tailless constructs interacted more strongly than the full-length hybrid proteins (Table II). Since we were not able to determine the relative strengths of interaction between the different NFTPs from the qualitative filter assays, we did the quantification using liquid assays with Chlorophenol red-β-D-galactopyranoside as the substrate. The results are illustrated in Fig. 1. Except for the pair of pGBT-L1-415 and pGAD-M1-421, co-transformation of hybrids of tailless NFL with any of the NFTPs yielded higher β-galactosidase activity than MΔ/MΔ, HΔ/HΔ, or MΔ/HΔ. It is interesting to notice that combinations with tailless NFL fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (GBT-LΔ) showed much lower β-galactosidase activities than those with tailless NFL fused to the GAL4 activation domain (GAD-LΔ). This phenomenon is consistent with the results shown in Table I, in which full-length NFTPs were used for hybrid construction. The cloning of NFL in the pGBT9 vector may thus account for the low β-galactosidase activity of GAD-M1-421 with GBT-L1-415 (Fig. 1), as well as the lack of detection of interaction between GBT-L24-524 and GAD-NFM or GAD-NFH (Table I). These results suggest that NFL is capable of forming homodimers as well as heterodimers with NFH and NFM. Furthermore, the formation of NFL/NFH and probably NFL/NFM heterodimers appears to be preferred to the formation of homodimers of NFH and NFM.Table IIInteractions between tailless NFTPs on β-galatosidase filter assayspGAD424pGBT9HΔMΔLΔHΔ++++++++++MΔ+++++++++LΔ++++++++++++ Open table in a new tab To determine whether the head domains of the NFTPs have an effect on the interactions observed in these assays, we removed a portion of the head domain from the tailless NFL construct and then tested for the resulting partial headless/tailless NFL hybrid (ΔLΔ) for its interaction with the other tailless NFTPs constructs. The results of the quantitative assays of different combinations are shown in Fig. 2A. From comparisons with the results shown in Fig. 1, it is apparent that the partial removal of part of the NFL head domain did not prevent NFL from interacting with the NFTPs. These results support the hypothesis that the formation of NFTP dimers is mostly mediated by the rod domains although the remaining head domain of NFL could still play a role in these interactions. We also deleted part of the head domain from the tailless NFM construct to see if the resulting partial headless/tailless NFM (ΔMΔ) would be able to interact with the other NFTPs constructs. The results show that the ΔMΔ has a similar interaction profile with the other NFTPs (Fig. 2B) as the tailless NFM (Fig. 1) and that lower β-galactosidase activities were observed when the ΔMΔ construct is fused to the GAL4 activation domain than when it is fused to the binding domain. However, the interactions between tailless NFL (LΔ) with ΔMΔ are stronger than the self-interaction of ΔMΔ regardless of which vector the NFM construct was cloned (compare ΔMΔ/LΔ and LΔ/ΔMΔ with ΔMΔ/ΔMΔ in Fig. 2). In a recent study of the interactions between different domains of vimentin using the yeast two-hybrid system, Meng et al. (22Meng J. Khan S. Ip W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1599-1604Google Scholar) showed that vimentin dimers and tetramers both exist in the transformed yeast cells. This result raises the possibility that tetramers are also formed in our system and that part of the β-galactosidase activities of yeast co-transformed with NFL and NFM (or NFL and NFH) is due to the interactions between NFL homodimers and NFM (or NFH) homodimers. However, our results show that the self-interactions of NFM and NFH are weak (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Therefore, if tetramers are formed in this system, they are more likely to consist of either two NFL/NFM (or NFL/NFH) heterodimers or an NFL/NFL homodimer and an NFL/NFM (or NFL/NFH) heterodimer rather than NFL/NFL and NFM/NFM (or NFH/NFH) homodimers. Overall, the results from the two-hybrid system show that the interactions between NFL and NFL, NFL and NFH, and also very likely NFL and NFM are stronger than the interactions of NFM with NFM, NFH with NFH, or NFH with NFM. We therefore would predict that in the presence of all three NFTPs, these higher interaction affinities would cause NFL to self-polymerize and co-polymerize with NFM and NFH into filaments, whereas NFM and NFH would be less likely to form homopolymers or NFM/NFH heteropolymers than NFM/NFL or NFL/NFH heteropolymers. These results are therefore consistent with the ability of NFL to self-polymerize in vitro but are in apparent contradiction with the transfection results which show that NFL alone does not assemble into filaments in transfected cells (9Ching G.Y. Liem R.K.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1323-1335Google Scholar, 10Lee M.K. Xu Z. Wong P.C. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1337-1350Google Scholar). However, the data are consistent with the results that showed that NFL is present only in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of transfected cells, even in the absence of a filamentous network, whereas relatively higher amounts of NFM and NFH are present in the soluble fraction (9Ching G.Y. Liem R.K.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1323-1335Google Scholar). Thus NFL is able to form higher order filamentous structures, but not a filamentous network, which would require NFM and NFH (in the form of NFL/NFM and NFL/NFH heterodimers) to interact with the NFL homodimers. Our results also show that the NFTPs are able to interact with vimentin in the two-hybrid system and imply that in transfected cultured cells they could co-polymerize with vimentin via the formation of heterodimers. Finally, our results suggest that during the assembly process of neurofilaments, both homodimers and heterodimers of the various NFTPs are present, but for NFM and NFH, heterodimer formation with NFL would be more preferred to formation of homodimers.

In resting platelets, the major PLCs such as PLCβ2, PLCβ3a (155 kDa), and PLCγ2 and the minor PLCs (PLCβ1 and PLCγ1) were located in the Triton X-100-soluble (Tx·Sol) fraction and the membrane skeleton, whereas PLCβ3b (140 kDa) was present only in Tx·Sol fraction when examined by Western immunoblotting. Thrombin stimulation caused a rapid and transient translocation of PLCβ3a and PLCβ3b and a slower accumulation of PLCβ2 and PLCγ2 in the reorganized CSK. The translocation to CSK of both PLCβ3a and PLCβ3b, but not PLCβ2, was dependent on integrin αIIbβ3-mediated aggregation. Furthermore, an actin polymerization inhibitor, cytochalasin D, or a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, abolished the CSK association of αIIbβ3, PLCβ3a, and PLCβ3b. In the genistein-pretreated platelets, pp60c-src, Gq, and protein kinase Cα were no longer able to associate with CSK. In contrast, these agents had no or marginal inhibitory effects on the CSK association of PLCβ2 and Gi2. The late diacylglycerol generation induced by thrombin stimulation was significantly reduced by the genistein treatment. These results suggest that the integrin αIIbβ3-mediated cytoskeletal association of PLCβ3 is regulated by protein tyrosine kinase and also that the activation of the relocated PLC may play a role in the late platelet-to-platelet aggregation in thrombin-stimulated human platelets.

Integrins have recently been known to play important roles in cellular functions, e.g. adhesion, migration, cell proliferation, and differentiation (1Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 is involved in bi-directional signaling across the plasma membrane (2Zhang J. Fry M.J.

When platelets are stimulated by agonists such as thrombin, intracellular signal transduction (intracellular calcium increase and protein kinase C activation) can be activated, leading to a conformational change in the extracellular domains of integrin αIIbβ3 that increases its affinity for adhesive ligands, for example fibrinogen, resulting in platelet aggregation. Conversely, ligand binding to integrin αIIbβ3 is involved in outside-in signals; its association with cytoskeleton causes biochemical changes including tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, increase in intracellular calcium level, and activation of the calcium-dependent neutral protease (calpain) (6Yamaguchi A.

Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17321-17326Google Scholar). The role of PI 3-kinase in integrin-induced changes in cell behavior is not fully understood. However, the finding that wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, blocks thrombin-induced actin rearrangement suggests a possible involvement of the kinase in a signaling event that occurs upon ligand engagement of integrin and platelet aggregation evoked by thrombin (20Guinebault C. Payrastre B. Racaud-Aultan C. Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Google Scholar). PI 4-kinase and PLC activities are increased in the reorganized cytoskeletal complex produced by thrombin stimulation (2Zhang J. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Jaken S. Liao L. Fox J.E.B. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4686-4692Google Scholar, 8Grondin P. Plantavid M. Sultan C. Breton M. Mauco G. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15705-15709Google Scholar). The increased amount of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate caused by integrin engagement would be important for the polymerization of actin, because besides the principal role as the preferred substrate for PLC, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate can regulate actin polymerization by binding to actin-binding proteins such as profilin and gelsolin. Our previous study indicated evidence suggesting that thrombin activation of human platelets causes cleavage of PLCβ3 by calpain leading to its enhanced activity by Gβγ subunits (21Banno Y. Nakashima S. Hachiya T. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4318-4324Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear if there would be functional consequences of association of PLCβ3 with CSK. The co-localization of signaling molecules with the CSK raises the intriguing possibility that CSK may be intimately involved in signal transduction induced by integrin-ligand interaction. Therefore, this study was undertaken to examine the CSK association of different PLC isozymes and also the regulatory mechanisms of the cytoskeletal reorganization that occur as a consequence of integrin-ligand interaction in thrombin-stimulated human platelets. Monoclonal antibody to integrin β3 (mAb-INβ3) B6A3 was kindly supplied from Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Tsukuba, Japan). Calpain inhibitor, calpeptin, was kindly provided by Dr. Jun-ichi Kambayashi (Osaka University Medical School, Japan). Polyclonal antibodies to PLC isozymes (β1, β2, β4, γ1, γ2, δ1, δ2), Gqα, PKCα, Gβ, and c-Src were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (San Francisco, CA). Anti-Gi2α antibody was from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Polyclonal antibodies to PLCβ3 (Ab-PLCβ3C and Ab-PLCβ3M) were prepared as described previously (21Banno Y. Nakashima S. Hachiya T. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4318-4324Google Scholar). The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham Corp. Thrombin, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS), and genistein were purchased from Sigma. Washed human platelets were prepared by the method described previously (21Banno Y. Nakashima S. Hachiya T. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4318-4324Google Scholar). Human blood was drawn by venipuncture, and platelet-rich plasma was obtained. Platelets were isolated by gel filtration on a Sepharose 2B column. Washed platelets were resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 109 platelets/ml in Hepes-Tyrode's buffer (129 mM NaCl, 8.9 mM NaHCO3, 0.8 mM KH2PO4, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 5.6 mM dextrose, and 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4). Washed platelet suspension (0.5 ml) was incubated with stirring at 37°C in an aggregometer (Frenius, Bad Homburg, Germany). CaCl2 (1 mM) was added 30 s prior to addition of 1 unit/ml thrombin. Aggregation was measured by percentage change in light transmission. In some experiments, as indicated, platelets were preincubated for 15 min with synthetic peptide consisting of the sequence RGDS (0.5 mM) or with mAb-INβ3 (50 µg/ml). In some experiments, platelets were pretreated with calpain inhibitor calpeptin (30 µM), cytochalasin D (20 µM), or genistein (100–150 µM), or Me2SO (0.2%, control) for 5–20 min at 37°C prior to addition of 1 unit/ml thrombin. Washed platelets (1 × 109/ml) were pretreated with Me2SO (0.3%, control) or genistein (150 µM) at 37°C for 20 min and stimulated with thrombin (1 unit/ml) for 2 min and terminated by adding 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v). Lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-918Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol (DAG) mass content was by the conversion of DAG into [32P]phosphatidic acid by Escherichia coli DAG kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, according to the method as described previously (23Nakashima S. Suganuma A. Matsui A. Nozawa Y. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 355-361Google Scholar). Platelets were lysed by addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 2 × Triton lysis buffer containing 50 mM Hepes-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM EGTA, leupeptin (20 µg/ml), 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mMβ-glycerophosphate, and 2% Triton X-100 and left on ice for 30 min. The Triton X-100-soluble (Tx·Sol) and -insoluble fractions (cytoskeleton; CSK and membrane skeleton; MSK) were isolated as described (24Fox J.E.B. Boyles J.K. Berndt M.C. Steffen P.K. Anderson L.K. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1525-1538Google Scholar). The CSK and MSK fractions were washed once in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. For immunoblotting with anti-PLC antibodies, the CSK and MSK fractions were resuspended in 200 and 150 µl of LIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% cholate, 0.5% SDS, 10 mM EGTA, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin), respectively, plus 50 µl of 5 × sample buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl, 8.2% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8), and heated at 95°C for 10 min. The Tx·Sol fraction was mixed at a ratio of 4:1 with 5 × sample buffer and boiled. Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 6% polyacrylamide, transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and then incubated with antibodies against PLC isozymes. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with the chemiluminescence (ECL) method (Amersham Corp.). The intensities of the bands were quantitated by densitometry (ATTO Densitograph AE-6900M) and quantitations were performed within the linear range. To know actin amounts in the CSK fraction, proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%), followed by staining of the gel with 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the bands corresponding to actin were measured by the densitometry. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as standard. We have previously demonstrated that human platelets contained two PLCβ3 forms that are different in molecular mass (PLCβ3a, 155 kDa and PLCβ3b, 140 kDa) when analyzed by using the Ab-PLCβ3C against the C-terminal (amino acids 1202-1217) of PLCβ3 and Ab-PLCβ3M against the 550–561 amino acid residue of PLCβ3 (21Banno Y. Nakashima S. Hachiya T. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4318-4324Google Scholar). The PLCβ3b was only detected with Ab-PLCβ3M but not Ab-PLCβ3C, suggesting that there is C-terminal proteolysis. As indicated in Fig. 1, the distribution of these two PLCβ3 forms was different in the resting platelets; PLCβ3a was present in the Tx·Sol and MSK, whereas PLCβ3b was only present in Tx·Sol fraction. PLCβ2, PLCβ3a, and PLCγ2 were present in both Tx·Sol and MSK fractions but absent in CSK fraction. A small amount of PLCγ1 was present and PLCβ1 was hardly detectable. PLCβ4, PLCδ1, and PLCδ2 were unable to be detected under the conditions used here. The same volume (20 µl) from each fraction (Tx·Sol, 1.0 ml; MSK, 0.15 ml; and CSK, 0.2 ml) was subjected to densitometric analysis of immunoblots (n = 4). It has been shown that 90% of PLCβ2, 87% of PLCβ3a, and 90% of PLCγ2 were located in the Tx·Sol fraction, whereas 9, 10, and 8% of each PLC isozyme were in the MSK fraction. In contrast, PLCβ3b was entirely distributed in the Tx·Sol fraction. Upon platelet stimulation with 1 unit/ml thrombin for 30 s, all PLC isozymes appeared in the CSK at different levels. The extents of CSK association of PLCβ3a and PLCβ3b were increased 24- and 80-fold, respectively, while those of PLCβ2 and PLCγ2 were 3- and 10-fold. At 30 s after stimulation with thrombin, approximately one-fourth of total PLCβ3b was translocated to CSK. The time course of translocations of PLC isozymes in thrombin-stimulated platelets displayed decreases of PLCβ3(a, b) in the Tx·Sol fraction (Fig. 2, left panels) and increases in the CSK fraction, reaching a maximum at 30 s after stimulation (Fig. 2, right panels). No significant changes of PLCs were seen in the MSK fraction (Fig. 2, middle panels). These results suggested that the PLCs translocated to CSK were originated from Tx·Sol but not from MSK. The marked decreases of PLCβ3(a, b) in the CSK after 30 s stimulation were compatible with our previous observations that PLCβ3(a, b) were proteolytically degraded to 100 kDa by the activation of calpain in thrombin-stimulated platelets (21Banno Y. Nakashima S. Hachiya T. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4318-4324Google Scholar). This truncated form (100 kDa) was detected in CSK (data not shown). Although PLCβ2 and PLCγ2 were also translocated to CSK from the Tx·Sol fraction by thrombin stimulation, the extents were much smaller compared with those of PLCβ3. Interestingly, unlike PLCβ3, both PLCβ2 and -γ2 underwent progressive accumulation in CSK (Fig. 2, right panels) The total amounts of these two PLCs (β2, γ2) in the Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions were consistent, indicating that they are resistant to proteolytic attack by calpain. Aggregation requires fibrinogen binding to the activated integrin αIIbβ3 in thrombin-stimulated platelets (2Zhang J. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Jaken S. Liao L. Fox J.E.B. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4686-4692Google Scholar, 3Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.A. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Google Scholar, 4Clark E.A. Shattil S.J. Brugge J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 464-469Google Scholar, 5Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1863-1871Google Scholar). To examine involvement of the fibrinogen binding to the integrin in the CSK association of PLCs, platelets were pretreated with the fibrinogen antagonist peptide RGDS or with the inhibitory monoclonal integrin β3 antibody (mAb-INβ3) (25Yano S. Suzuki K. Katoh M. Sugita Y. Kaku S. Kawamura K. Masuho Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 778-786Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that the thrombin stimulation caused an increase of protein content in CSK in a time-dependent manner and reached a plateau at 30–60 s after stimulation (Fig. 3). The increased proteins contain mainly polymerized actin as well as MSK proteins (3Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.A. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Google Scholar). The enhancement of actin polymerization was prevented by RGDS or mAb-INβ3, thereby leading to considerable inhibition of thrombin-induced aggregation. Under these conditions we have examined the CSK association of different PLC isozymes. It has been known that integrin αIIbβ3 is located in MSK in resting platelets and then translocated to the reorganized actin-rich CSK by platelet aggregation (3Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.A. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Google Scholar, 24Fox J.E.B. Boyles J.K. Berndt M.C. Steffen P.K. Anderson L.K. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1525-1538Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, the integrin αIIbβ3 appeared in CSK at 15 s after thrombin stimulation and reached the maximal level at 120 s when platelets were nearly fully aggregated. The relocation of αIIbβ3 to the actin-rich CSK was inhibited by RGDS or mAb-INβ3. The time course of PLC translocation to CSK showed a good correlation with that of the integrin αIIbβ3 translocation. Interestingly, the pretreatment of platelets with RGDS or mAb-INβ3 caused differential inhibition in CSK association of PLC isozymes (Table I). The CSK association of PLCβ3(a, b) was almost completely prevented by either RGDS or mAb-INβ3, but the association of PLCγ2 and β2 was much less affected. The PLC isozymes, PLCβ2, PLCβ3a, and PLCγ2, in MSK of resting platelets were unaffected with these treatments (data not shown). These results suggested the differential regulation in the integrin αIIbβ3-mediated cytoskeletal association of PLC isozymes.Fig. 4Effects of RGDS and mAb-INβ3on CSK association of PLC isozymes and integrin αIIbβ3in thrombin-stimulated platelets. Washed platelets were pretreated with RGDS (0.5 mg/ml) or mAb-INβ3 (50 µg/ml) and then stimulated by thrombin (1 unit/ml) for 30 s. Control platelets without the pretreatments were stimulated with thrombin for the indicated times. The CSK fractions were prepared, lysed, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described in Fig. 1. Data are representative of three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IInhibition of PLCs translocation to CSK by RGDS and mAb-INβ3Inhibition (%)RGDSmAb-INβ3PLCβ218.1 ± 3.316.1 ± 2.3PLCβ3a84.7 ± 8.580.3 ± 6.5PLCβ3b90.6 ± 5.988.6 ± 4.9PLCγ264.8 ± 5.640.5 ± 7.6αIIbβ395.0 ± 1.290.0 ± 1.2 Open table in a new tab As seen in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, during a concomitant increase in aggregation, there were decreases in CSK association of PLCβ3(a, b) after the peak at 30 s after stimulation. In our previous study, similar decreases of these PLCβ3(a, b) enzymes have been observed in intact platelets stimulated with thrombin, which were thought to be induced by calpain activation (21Banno Y. Nakashima S. Hachiya T. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4318-4324Google Scholar). Then we examined whether the translocation of PLCs to CSK are associated with calpain activation. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, calpeptin, a specific calpain inhibitor, did not interfere with relocation of all PLCs to CSK, thus indicating that once translocated to the reorganized CSK, PLCβ3(a, b) were proteolytically modified by calpain. It has been demonstrated that the extracellular triggering of integrin response involves hierarchies of protein interactions upon tyrosine phosphorylation and actin polymerization (26Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Google Scholar). To examine whether the CSK association of PLCs is dependent on actin integrity or protein tyrosine phosphorylation, platelets were pretreated with cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, or genistein, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor. As indicated in Fig. 5B, an increase of polymerized actin in CSK fraction was reduced to 27% by cytochalasin D pretreatment. The same treatment caused the decreased CSK association of PLCβ3(a, b) to 23 and 14% of the untreated control, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, no inhibition by cytochalasin D was observed in the CSK association of PLCβ2. These results indicated that actin polymerization is involved in the CSK association of PLCβ3(a, b). Experiments with tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A, has indicated that tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins is required for the cytoskeletal attachment of integrin αIIbβ3 (15Schoenwaelder S.M. Jackson S.P. Yuan Y. Teasdale M.S. Salem H.H. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32479-32487Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the effect of genistein on the cytoskeletal association of PLC enzymes in thrombin-stimulated platelets. Genistein (100 µM) pretreatment of platelets caused a marked reduction (80%) in the thrombin-induced CSK association of αIIbβ3 (Fig. 5, A and B). Similar inhibitory effects were observed in PLCβ3(a, b), although genistein had no effect on actin polymerization. There was no inhibition for PLCβ2 translocation. Moreover, it was shown that pp60c-src and protein kinase Cα were translocated to the CSK fraction in thrombin-stimulated platelets (Fig. 6). However, this event was blocked by pretreatment of genistein. Heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins, Gi2 and Gq, as detected by specific antibodies, were also translocated to the reorganized CSK in thrombin-stimulated platelets. The translocation to CSK was regulated differently; the CSK association of Gq was inhibited by treatment of genistein but that of Gi2 was not. These findings that genistein selectively inhibited the αIIbβ3-mediated cytoskeletal association of signaling molecules raise the possibility that tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in their differential translocation to CSK. Our previous study indicated that thrombin stimulation of human platelets induced a biphasic accumulation of DAG by PLC activation; the early phase showed a sharp rapid peak at 10 s after stimulation, and the subsequent second phase DAG formation is slow and sustained, reaching a maximum at 2 min, where platelets are fully aggregated (23Nakashima S. Suganuma A. Matsui A. Nozawa Y. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 355-361Google Scholar). Since genistein prevented the translocation to CSK of PLCβ3(a, b) (Fig. 5), effect of genistein on DAG formation was examined at 2 min after thrombin stimulation. As shown in Fig. 7, a significant reduction of DAG formation was observed in genistein-pretreated platelets. Similar inhibition of DAG formation was also caused by another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A (data not shown). These results suggested that the late DAG formation could be partly due to PI hydrolysis via the PLCβ3(a, b) translocated to the reorganized CSK. At the present time, we do not have relevant interpretation for the role of PLCβ3 activation at the reorganized CSK in the late stage of platelet aggregation (platelet-to-platelet aggregation). However, a recent report has shown that the αIIbβ3-mediated signaling regulated by protein tyrosine phosphorylation participates in formation of fibrin polymers (15Schoenwaelder S.M. Jackson S.P. Yuan Y. Teasdale M.S. Salem H.H. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32479-32487Google Scholar). In fact, we also have observed the inhibition of the thrombin-induced clot retraction in genistein-treated platelets (data not shown). Several lines of evidence indicate that integrins are involved in bi-directional signaling across the plasma membrane (1Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Google Scholar). In platelets, the agonist stimulation causes activation of αIIbβ3 integrin by unique signal transduction (inside-out signaling), and the subsequent fibrinogen binding to the αIIbβ3 integrin, leading to cytoskeletal rearrangement and platelet aggregation, causes tyrosine kinase activation including pp125FAK and pp60c-src (outside-in signaling) (1Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Google Scholar, 3Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.A. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Google Scholar, 4Clark E.A. Shattil S.J. Brugge J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 464-469Google Scholar, 27Fox J.E.B. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 344: 175-185Google Scholar). The ability of αIIbβ3 to undergo cytoskeletal rearrangement is blocked by the monoclonal antibody to integrin β3 or the fibrinogen antagonist, RGDS (27Fox J.E.B. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 344: 175-185Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent study has shown that protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein or herbimycin A, and actin polymerization inhibitor, cytochalasin D, prevent the association of various signaling molecules with integrin (26Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the integrin αIIbβ3 is anchored to underlying cytoskeletal molecules and that the association of αIIbβ3 with cytoskeletal proteins is regulated by activation of protein tyrosine kinases. In the present study, we have demonstrated that in thrombin-stimulated human platelets, the PLCβ3(a, b) were preferentially relocated to the detergent-insoluble actin-rich CSK (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). This translocation was dependent on the integrin αIIbβ3 activation (Fig. 4 and Table I). Furthermore, it is inhibited by either cytochalasin D or genistein (Fig. 5, Fig. 6), suggesting that the translocation of PLCβ3(a, b) to CSK is mediated by formation of microfilament-dependent complexes containing αIIbβ3 protein tyrosine kinase and their substrates in aggregated platelets. The decreases in the PLCβ3(a, b) level were observed in CSK after the peak at 30 s of thrombin stimulation (Fig. 2, right panels). In our earlier report it was indicated that PLCβ3 is one of the substrates for calpain in thrombin-stimulated human platelets (21Banno Y. Nakashima S. Hachiya T. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4318-4324Google Scholar). Thus it was conceivable that the decreased PLCβ3 level reflects its cleavage by calpain. In fact, calpeptin, a calpain inhibitor, blocked the cleavage of PLCβ3(a, b), although the inhibitor did not inhibit their translocation to CSK mediated by αIIbβ3 activation. In addition to the PLCβ3, some other proteins also are cleaved by calpain in the late aggregation phase, and their products are located in CSK (28Ezumi Y. Takayama H. Okuma M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11927-11934Google Scholar, 29Earnest J.P. Santos G.F. Zuerbig S. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27259-27265Google Scholar). The calpain activation has been known to be dependent on αIIbβ3-ligand interaction (7Fox J.E.B. Taylor R.G. Taffarel M. Boyles J.K. Goll D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1501-1507Google Scholar). The fibrinogen antagonist RGDS or antibody mAb-INβ3 could prevent the cleavage of PLCβ3 (data not shown). Therefore, it can be assumed that the cleavage by calpain of PLCβ3(a, b) may be associated with the integrin activation. We have previously shown in in vitro experiments that the cleavage of purified PLCβ3a by calpain produced a 100 kDa PLC and that this truncated PLC was, to a greater extent, activated by Gβγ subunits than its original forms (30Banno Y. Asano T. Nozawa Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 185-188Google Scholar). The present study using intact platelets indicated that heterotrimeric G proteins (Gi2 and Gq) involving PLCβ3 activation were translocated to the reorganized CSK (Fig. 6). The location of the heterotrimeric G protein in the cytoskeleton was described in a previous report that demonstrated that Gγ5 was co-localized with vinculin in association with focal adhesions (31Hasen C.A. Schroering A.G. Carey D.J. Robishaw J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 811-819Google Scholar). Moreover, it was recently shown that Gqα/G11α was recovered in the actin-rich fraction in agonist-stimulated rat mammary tumor (WRK) cells and that cytochalasin D inhibited G protein-induced PLC activation, suggesting an important role of the actin-rich cytoskeleton in the G protein-regulated PLC activation (32Ibarrondo J. Joubert D. Dufour M.N. Cohen-Solal A. Homburger V. Jard S. Guillon G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8413-8417Google Scholar). Accordingly, PLCβ3(a, b) translocated to CSK was assumed to be activated by the G proteins in thrombin-stimulated platelets. There was DAG production with a peak at 2 min after stimulation. This late DAG formation was reduced by genistein pretreatment which blocked the translocation of PLCβ3 and Gq (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). Our previous study has suggested that thrombin stimulates a biphasic accumulation of DAG, with an early phase reaching a peak at 10 s and a later phase at 2–3 min, and that the second phase of DAG accumulation may be derived from PIs in human platelets (23Nakashima S. Suganuma A. Matsui A. Nozawa Y. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 355-361Google Scholar). These results lead us to speculate that the integrin-ligand interaction induces translocation to the actin-rich CSK of PLCβ3(a, b) and Gq, resulting in DAG accumulation by activated PLCβ3 in the late aggregation step. Several lines of evidence suggest that protein tyrosine kinases such as pp60c-src are required for the cytoskeletal attachment of integrin αIIbβ3 (9Horvath A.R. Muszbek L. Kellie S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 855-861Google Scholar, 26Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Google Scholar, 33Soriano P. Montgomery G. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Google Scholar) and also for the retraction of fibrin polymers in thrombin-stimulated platelets (15Schoenwaelder S.M. Jackson S.P. Yuan Y. Teasdale M.S. Salem H.H. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32479-32487Google Scholar). We have demonstrated here that the pretreatment of platelets with genistein prevented the CSK association of various signaling molecules, such as PLCβ3(a, b), pp60c-src, Gq, PKCα, and αIIbβ3, thus leading to inhibition of the PLC activation. These findings have led us to postulate that the translocation of PLCβ3 to CSK which was controlled by protein tyrosine kinase may play a role in the late aggregation (formation of large platelet-to-platelet aggregation). It has been known that platelets have at least two adhesive glycoprotein receptors, integrin α2β1 (GPIa-IIa) and αIIbβ3 (GPIIb-IIIa), which mediate transmembrane signaling (3Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L.

The β1 or β2 family of integrins induces activation of the tyrosine kinase PLCγ1 pathway (37Nishibe S. Wahl M.I. Hernandez-Sotomayor S.M. Tonks N.K. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. Science. 1990; 250: 1253-1256Google Scholar, 38Kanner S.B. Grosmaire L.S. Ledbetter J.A. Damle N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7099-7103Google Scholar). Recently, PLCγ2, but not γ1, was shown to be activated via tyrosine phosphorylation in platelets stimulated by collagen but not by thrombin (39Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Smith J.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 617-622Google Scholar, 40Blake R.A. Schieven G.L. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 212-216Google Scholar). Our data obtained in this study demonstrated that in the cytoskeletal association of thrombin-stimulated platelets, PLCγ2 is distinct from PLCβ3 in that PLCβ3 is entirely integrin αIIbβ3-dependent and inhibited by cytochalasin D. Thus, PLCγ2 appears to play a role in the transmembrane signaling initiated through α2β1 rather than αIIbβ3 in platelet aggregation. In addition, PLCβ2, which is most abundant in platelets, also becomes associated with CSK by aggregation with thrombin, but its association was independent of αIIbβ3 and not inhibited by cytochalasin D and genistein, suggesting that PLCβ2 participates in the early stage of agonist-induced signaling but not in the integrin-mediated signaling pathway in human platelets. However, the activation mechanisms and exact roles of different PLC isozymes in these two pathways remain to be disclosed. We thank Dr. J. Kambayashi (Osaka University Medical School, Osaka, Japan) for the supply of calpain inhibitor, calpeptin, and Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

The pC-collagen II was then used as a substrate to generate collagen II fibrils by cleavage with procollagen C-proteinase at 37°C. Electron microscopy of the fibrils demonstrated that, at the early stages of fibril assembly, very thin fibrils were formed. As the system approached equilibrium over 7–12 h, however, the thin fibrils were largely but not completely replaced by thick fibrils that had diameters of about 240 nm and a distinct D-period banding pattern. One typical fibril was photographed and analyzed in its entirety. The fibril was 776 D-periods (52 µm) long. It had a central shaft with a uniform diameter that was about 516 D-periods long and two tips of about 100 D-periods each. Most of the central shaft had a symmetrical banding pattern flanked by two transition regions of about 30 D-periods each. Measurements by scanning transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the mass per unit length from the tips to the shafts increased linearly over approximately 100 D-periods from the fibril end. The linear increase in mass per unit length was consistent with previous observations for collagen I fibrils and established that the tips of collagen II also had a near paraboloidal shape. However, the orientation of monomers in the tips differed from the tips of collagen I fibrils in that the C termini instead of the N termini were directed toward the tips. The thin fibrils that were present at early stages of assembly and at equilibrium were comparable to the collagen II fibrils seen in embryonic tissues and probably represented intermediates on the pathway of thick fibrils formation. The results indicated that the molecular events in the self-assembly of collagen II fibrils are apparently similar to those in self-assembly of collagen I fibrils, but that there are also important differences in the structural information contained in collagen I and collagen II monomers.

C., Ping-Sheng, L., Shen, T. Y., and Mensa-Wilmot, K. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 2517-2524). A set of novel fluorinated 2-deoxy-Ins-1-O-dodecylphosphonates were tested against PI-PLC, with potent competitive inhibition by 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-scyllo-Ins-1-O-dodecylphosphonate (VP-616L) (Xi(50) = 0.09). 2-Deoxy-2-fluoro-myo-Ins-1-O-dodecylphosphonate and 2-deoxy-2,2-difluoro-myo-Ins-1-O-dodecylphosphonate were 8.3-fold and 4.8-fold less effective, respectively, than VP-616L. Methyl 2-deoxy-2,2-difluoro-myo-Ins-1-O-dodecylphosphonate was inactive. Also, a hundredfold less PI-PLC is required to cleave a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) than is needed to cleave PI. Implied in these observations are the following: (i) in powerful inhibitors an active site residue probably interacts with the equatorially oriented fluoro substituent; (ii) substrate recognition requires a negative charge on the phosphoryl at the Ins-1 position, and (iii) a GPI is better substrate than PI, for PI-PLC. Aminoglycoside antibiotics kanamycin A, gentamycin, and G418 stimulated PI-PLC cleavage of the GPI anchor of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) from Trypanosoma brucei 2- to 4-fold. G418, which appears to act on the enzyme·;substrate complex, increased kcat and Km 6.4-fold and 9.9-fold, respectively. PI-PLC was activated by G418 even in the presence of the inhibitor VP-616L. In control experiments, the lectin concanavalin A (ConA), which probably acts by substrate sequestration, inhibited both PI-PLC (Xi(50) = 0.00025) and GPI-specific phospholipase D (Xi(50) = 0.00018). G418 failed to activate PI-PLC when ConA was present. These observations indicate that G418 is an allosteric activator of Bacillus cereus PI-PLC. Since G418 stimulates a purified enzyme that is not involved in aminoglycoside metabolism, we propose that binding of aminoglycosides to cellular proteins could contribute to the development of the nephrotoxicity associated with the use of these aminoglycoside antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W2022855757,"Four colicin A double-cysteine mutants possessing a disulfide bond in their pore-forming domain were constructed to study the translocation and the pore formation of colicin A.

These results indicate that α-helices 1, 2, 3, and 10 remain at the membrane surface after application of a membrane potential. Colicin A is a bacteriocin that kills sensitive Escherichia coli cells by forming voltage-gated ion channels in cytoplasmic membranes. Like many toxins, colicin A is organized into structural domains, each of them carrying one function associated with the toxin's lethal activity (1Baty D. Frenette M. Lloubès R. Géli V. Howard S.P. Pattus F. Lazdunski C. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 807-811Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain is involved in the translocation through the E. coli envelope, the central domain is responsible for the binding to a receptor on the bacterial surface, and the C-terminal domain possesses the pore-forming activity. The soluble form of this C-terminal domain obtained by mild proteolytic digestion was crystallized, and its three-dimensional structure was determined at 2.4 Å resolution. This molecule consists of a bundle of eight amphipathic α-helices surrounding two hydrophobic α-helices completely buried within the protein (2Parker M.W. Pattus F. Tucker A.D. Tsernoglou D. Nature. 1989; 337: 93-96Google Scholar, 3Parker M.W. Postma J.P.M. Pattus F. Tucker A. Tsernoglou D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 639-657Google Scholar). In vitro, the pore formation is divided into several steps including a voltage-independent membrane insertion and a voltage-dependent channel opening (4Duché D. Parker M.W. González-Mañas J.M. Pattus F. Baty D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6332-6339Google Scholar). The first step is initiated by an electrostatic interaction between colicin A and negatively charged phospholipids (5Massotte D. Dasseux J.L. Sauve P. Cyrklaff M. Leonard K. Pattus F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7713-7719Google Scholar, 6Van der Goot F.G. Didat N. Pattus F. Dowhan W. Letellier L. Eur. J.

Two models have been proposed to picture the conformational changes required for the colicin membrane insertion. In the first model, called the “umbrella model,” the three layers of helices that form the soluble structure are rearranged so that the hydrophobic hairpin of helices 8 and 9 traverses the membrane, whereas the helical pair 1 and 2 folds out on the surface in the opposite direction to helices 4–7 (8Parker M.W. Tucker A.D. Tsernoglou D. Pattus F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 126-129Google Scholar, 9Song H.Y. Cohen F.S. Cramer W.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2927-2934Google Scholar, 10Shin Y.-K. Levinthal C. Levinthal F. Hubbel W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 960-963Google Scholar). In the second model, called the “penknife model,” the hydrophobic helical hairpin lies parallel to the membrane plane (4Duché D. Parker M.W. González-Mañas J.M. Pattus F. Baty D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6332-6339Google Scholar, 11Lakey J.H. Duché D. González-Mañas J.-M. Baty D. Pattus F. J. Mol.

Colicin channels inserted in planar lipid bilayers are opened by applying a trans-negative potential over a certain threshold voltage (13Schein S.J. Kagan B.L. Finkelstein A. Nature. 1978; 276: 159-163Google Scholar, 14Collarini M. Amblard G. Lazdunski C. Pattus F. Eur. Biophys. J. 1987; 14: 147-153Google Scholar). The voltage gating of colicins involves the translocation of parts of the protein across the membrane exposing different domains to the cis and trans solutions in the open and closed states (15Raymond L. Slatin S.L. Finkelstein A. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 92: 255-268Google Scholar, 16Slatin S.L. Raymond L. Finkelstein A. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 92: 247-254Google Scholar). Recently, Slatin et al. (17Slatin S.L. Qiu X.Q. Jakes K.S. Finkelstein A. Nature. 1994; 371: 158-161Google Scholar) have demonstrated that large domains of colicin Ia can reversibly flip across the membrane. In a previous paper, we have discussed the effect of introducing four disulfide bonds in the colicin A pore-forming domain in order to analyze the voltage independent membrane insertion and the voltage dependent channel opening of the colicin A pore formation (4Duché D. Parker M.W. González-Mañas J.M. Pattus F. Baty D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6332-6339Google Scholar). These results suggested that the α-helices 8 and 9 did not cross the membrane without membrane potential and that the channel opening allowed drastic changes in the conformation of the pore-forming domain. In this paper we have used the same methodology to study the role of the first three helices of the colicin A pore-forming domain. The new double-cysteine mutants were tested for their capacity to promote K+ efflux from E. coli cells, to insert into lipid vesicles, and to form a conducting channel in planar lipid bilayers. The results obtained confirm the penknife model and suggest that the first three helices of the colicin A pore-forming domain are required to complete the colicin A translocation. The E. coli strain W3110 and plasmid pLR1 have been described (4Duché D. Parker M.W. González-Mañas J.M. Pattus F. Baty D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6332-6339Google Scholar). The W3110 strain containing the various mutated plasmids was grown in LB medium and used for construction of the mutants. In order to measure the K+ efflux induced by the colicin's activity, E. coli W3110 strain was grown at 37°C to an A650 of 0.5 (5 × 108 cells/ml) in LB medium, washed, resuspended in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), and kept on ice at a density of 5 × 1010 cells/ml. All single-cysteine mutants were obtained by the insertion of paired oligonucleotides into the plasmid pLR1 between restriction sites (4Duché D. Parker M.W. González-Mañas J.M. Pattus F. Baty D. J.

All single or double-cysteine mutants were expressed at the same level as the wild type colicin A. Colicin A single-cysteine mutants and double-cysteine mutants were purified from the extracellular medium, and their thiol groups were titrated as described previously (4Duché D. Parker M.W. González-Mañas J.M. Pattus F. Baty D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6332-6339Google Scholar).

To increase the intracellular potassium concentration above 400 nmol/mg dry weight, the cells (2 × 109/ml) were incubated for 5 min at 37°C in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing glucose (0.2%, w/v) and 0.5 mM KCl. The purified double-cysteine mutants were reduced with 5 mM DTT 1The abbreviations used are: DTTdithiothreitolBr-DOPGbrominated dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol. at 37°C for 10 min in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer and added to the E. coli cells at a multiplicity (number of colicins/cell) of 400.

The quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of colicin A by Br-DOPG vesicles was used to follow the membrane insertion kinetics of colicin A (20González-Mañas J.M. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7294-7300Google Scholar). The synthesis of Br-DOPG, the vesicle preparations, and the fluorescence measurements were carried out as described previously (4Duché D. Parker M.W.

Planar bilayers were formed in a small hole connecting two aqueous compartments using the Mueller-Rudin technique (22Mueller P. Rudin D.O. Ti Tien H. Wescott W.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 979-980Google Scholar). The phospholipids were Sigma Type II-S soybean L-α phosphatidylcholine. The hole was pretreated with a solution of phospholipids in decane (10 mg/ml). Membranes were then formed with the same solution by the brush technique. All conductance measurements were performed in 1 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris acetate (pH 4.0), 2 mM CaCl2. Known voltages were applied across the membrane, before colicin addition, to the cis side compartment under stirring, and the resulting current responses were measured. The trans compartment was connected to virtual ground. 50 ng/ml of wild type or double-cysteine mutants, treated with or without DTT, were added to the cis side of a lipid bilayer. Alternatively, 1 ng of protein could be added to record unitary currents. Potential sites for cysteine residue pairs that might form disulfide bonds were selected using the method of Hazes and Dijkstra (23Hazes B. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 119-126Google Scholar). Briefly, potential residue pairs were initially selected on the basis of appropriate Cβ-Cβ distances. Sulfur positions were generated for these residues, and it was checked whether certain stereochemical criteria were obeyed. A major criterion was that the χ−3 angles could not deviate by more than 30° from the observed preferences. Selected pairs were subjected to energy minimization and energetically favorable conformations were chosen (less than 10 kcal/mol) (Table II). Success of this method relies on the assumption that main chain conformations are very similar between wild type and mutant. Calculations were based on the refined model of the colicin A C-terminal domain (3Parker M.W. Postma J.P.M. Pattus F. Tucker A. Tsernoglou D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 639-657Google Scholar). This model has been refined to an R-factor of 0.18 at 2.4 Å resolution with good stereochemistry.Table IIPredicted geometries of engineered disulfides in colicin AMutantsMonomer AMonomer Bχ−3Energyχ−3Energydegreeskcal/moldegreeskcal/molH1/H2−723.4−863.5H2/H101265.11355.8H3/H9−932.7−1053.3H3/H101305.91265.7 Open table in a new tab The disulfide bonds were chosen to connect the first three helices of the colicin A C-terminal domain to the neighboring helices. These bonds, Ile19→ Cys/Ala42→ Cys (H1/H2), Lys33→ Cys/Glu198→ Cys (H2/H10), Ile66→ Cys/Ala181→ Cys (H3/H9), and Ser62→ Cys/Ala192→Cys (H3/H10) connected helices 1 and 2, helices 2 and 10, helices 3 and 9, and helices 3 and 10, respectively (Fig. 1). To introduce these disulfide bonds, we used the LR1 plasmid, which encodes the entire colicin A protein (4Duché D. Parker M.W. González-Mañas J.M. Pattus F. Baty D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6332-6339Google Scholar). From this plasmid, cassette mutagenesis was performed to introduce the cysteine residues (Table I). All the mutant proteins were expressed at the wild type level and were purified. Disulfide bond formation of the double-cysteine mutants was analyzed by sulfhydryl titrations. The purified proteins were first denatured in 8 M urea in order to expose the buried thiol groups, and then they were incubated with or without a reducing agent such as DTT and finally incubated with a thiol-specific reagent monobromobimane. The thiol groups were titrated with the monobromobimane only after the reduction of the double-cysteine mutants by DTT (Fig. 2). The double-cysteine mutants that reacted with the monobromobimane migrated slower than either the wild type or the nonreactive double-cysteine mutants in a nonreducing 7 M urea gel (Fig. 2). These results indicate that without a reducing agent the two thiol groups of the double-cysteine mutants form a disulfide bond. The effect of the disulfide bonds on the colicin A pore-forming activity were tested in E. coli cells by using a K+/valinomycin selective electrode. It has been previously described that colicin A, when added to E. coli sensitive cells, induced an efflux of cytoplasmic K+ that was correlated with the activity of the pore. The rate of this K+ efflux saturated at about 400 molecules/cell (18Bourdineaud J.-P. Boulanger P. Lazdunski C. Letellier L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1037-1041Google Scholar). At this multiplicity, the double-cysteine mutants did not cause a K+ efflux in contrast to the corresponding single-cysteine mutants (Table III). However, when these inactive mutants were preincubated with 5 mM DTT before their addition to the cells, their ability to induce a cytoplasmic K+ efflux was restored to the wild type level (Table III). This result indicates that the disulfide bonds block the in vivo colicin A pore-forming activity.Table IIIIn vivo activities of the cysteine mutantsMutantsInitial rate of K+ efflux−DTT+DTTnmol min−1 mg−1Wild type400410H1390420H2b380370H1/H29320H2a370380H10b390380H2/H1015335H3b410390H9420410H3/H920425H3a390400H10a400380H3/H1015400 Open table in a new tab Different steps can be blocked by the disulfide bonds. We examined the effect of the disulfide bond on the colicin A reception on the bacterial surface and translocation through the E. coli envelope. The K+ efflux induced by colicin A is preceded by a lag that corresponds to the time required for its binding to BtuB and OmpF and for its translocation through the envelope (18Bourdineaud J.-P. Boulanger P. Lazdunski C. Letellier L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1037-1041Google Scholar). At a multiplicity of 400 and at 37°C, the lag time equaled 27 s for the wild type colicin A and 29, 32, 28, and 30 s, respectively, for the H1/H2, H2/H10, H3/H9, and H3/H10 mutants whose disulfide bonds were reduced before their addition to the cells (data not shown). After incubation of the oxidized colicins with cells during 1 min at the multiplicity of 400 and at 37°C, the addition of 5 mM DTT resulted in a K+ efflux whose initial rate was identical to that of the colicin mutant reduced in vitro (data not shown). Interestingly, the time elapsing between the DTT addition and the K+ efflux equaled 8–10 s (data not shown). This time is shorter than the time required for the colicins translocation (see above). It is likely that this time represents the time needed for DTT action. Indeed, the time required for full in vitro reduction of the mutants treated with 5 mM DTT equaled 3–8 min (data not shown). Because colicin A is unfolded during its translocation, the time required for DTT action is shorter in vivo than in vitro (19Duché D. Baty D. Chartier M. Letellier L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24820-24825Google Scholar, 24Bénédetti H. Lloubès R. Lazdunski C. Letellier L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 441-447Google Scholar). This result indicates that the mutated colicins were fully translocated despite the presence of their disulfide bonds. The ability of the disulfide bonds to prevent the colicin A membrane insertion was tested with brominated phospholipid vesicles. Liposomes made of brominated phospholipids are an efficient system for studying colicin A membrane insertion. Indeed, the bromine atoms located at the midpoint of the phospholipid acyl chain quench the intrinsic fluorescence of the inserted colicin A (20González-Mañas J.M. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7294-7300Google Scholar, 21González-Mañas J.M. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 625-633Google Scholar). The quenching is due to a collisional mechanism or to a short distance resonance energy transfer (25Bolen E.J. Holloway P.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9638-9643Google Scholar). From these quenching experiments, the insertion kinetic constant (k) and the residual tryptophan fluorescence (RF) can be calculated (4Duché D. Parker M.W. González-Mañas J.M. Pattus F. Baty D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6332-6339Google Scholar). The disulfide bond that connects helices 2 and 10 was the only one able to prevent the colicin A membrane insertion (Fig. 3, top). Reduction of the disulfide bond with DTT restored the ability of the H2/H10 mutant to insert into Br-DOPG vesicles. The H1/H2, H3/H9, and H3/H10 mutants were able to insert into Br-DOPG vesicles without preincubation with DTT (Fig. 3, bottom). The insertion kinetic constant and the residual fluorescence of the oxidized H3/H9 and H3/H10 mutants and reduced H2/H10 mutant were quite similar to those of the colicin A wild type (Table IV). However, the insertion kinetic constant of the oxidized H1/H2 mutant was higher as compared with the wild type. A similar behavior was encountered previously with cysteine mutation, which destabilized the colicin A conformation (26Izard J. Parker M.W. Chartier M. Duché D. Baty D. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1495-1500Google Scholar) and favored its membrane insertion (4Duché D. Parker M.W. González-Mañas J.M. Pattus F. Baty D. J. Biol.

As described previously (14Collarini M. Amblard G. Lazdunski C. Pattus F. Eur. Biophys. J. 1987; 14: 147-153Google Scholar), adding the wild type colicin A to the cis side of the bilayer resulted in voltage-dependent currents. The current activated at large depolarizations (e.g., +90 mV in Fig. 4A) and deactivated upon repolarization. Both activating and deactivating rates were strongly voltage-dependent. Once incorporated in a functional state, the channel opened and closed at a rate determined by the membrane polarization. The H1/H2 and H3/H10 mutants were found able to form functional channels without the need of preincubation with DTT (Fig. 4B). The overall behavior of the resulting macroscopic current was similar to that of the wild type colicin A. Unitary currents (insets in Fig. 4, A and B) of the wild type, H1/H2, and H3/H10 mutants had similar amplitude corresponding to a unitary conductance of 5.1 ± 0.6 pS. By contrast, the disulfide bonds connecting either helices 3 and 9 or helices 2 and 10 prevented the formation of functional channels, even in a permanently depolarized bilayer (first part of current trace in Fig. 4C). Preincubating the mutants with DTT or adding DTT to the mutant-containing cis side of the bilayer (Fig. 4C) restored the ability of the protein to incorporate in the bilayer. The resulting channel had a unitary conductance similar to that of wild type colicin A (inset in Fig. 4C). This process was, however, slow, and several depolarizations were required for the mutants to induce large currents. Although we did not performed a systematic study, it appeared that the voltage gating of the reduced H3/H9 and H2/H10 mutants differed from that of the wild type protein, with fast flickering in the open state and incomplete deactivation at large negative potentials (not illustrated). Soluble pore-forming colicins undergo conformational changes during their membrane insertion. They are unfolded during their reception and translocation through the E. coli envelope (19Duché D. Baty D. Chartier M. Letellier L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24820-24825Google Scholar, 24Bénédetti H. Lloubès R. Lazdunski C. Letellier L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 441-447Google Scholar). In the presence of membrane potential, the colicin A C-terminal domain inserts into the membrane and forms a conducting channel (4Duché D. Parker M.W. González-Mañas J.M. Pattus F. Baty D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6332-6339Google Scholar, 17Slatin S.L. Qiu X.Q. Jakes K.S. Finkelstein A. Nature. 1994; 371: 158-161Google Scholar, 27Abrams C.K. Jakes K.S. Finkelstein A. Slatin S.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 77-93Google Scholar, 28Lakey J.H. González-Mañas J.-M. Van der Goot F.G. Pattus F. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 26-29Google Scholar). In order to analyze the conformational changes associated with these different steps, four disulfide bonds were introduced in the colicin A C-terminal domain. The disulfide bonds were designed to connect the first three helices of the pore-forming domain to neighboring helices. The aim of these disulfide bonds was to restrict the degree of freedom of the first three helices of the colicin A C-terminal domain and to determine the influence of these helices in the colicin A translocation, membrane insertion, and/or channel formation. In the first part of this paper we demonstrated that all the disulfide bonds were able to prevent the in vivo colicin A activity without affecting the colicin A translocation through the E. coli envelope. Indeed, the oxidized colicins were inactive, but as DTT was added in vitro, they recovered full channel activity as judged from their capacity to induce an efflux of cytoplasmic K+ of the same amplitude as the wild type colicin. Channel activity was also recovered by incubating the oxidized colicins with E. coli cells and then adding DTT. The translocation of the wild type colicin A and the mutants required 27–32 s. Interestingly, when the oxidized colicins were incubated with bacteria for a time longer than that needed for full translocation (see above), the efflux of K+ started only 8–10 s after DTT addition. This short delay, which represents the time needed for DTT action, indicated that the oxidized colicins were translocated and already close to the inner membrane when DTT was added to the external medium. This result is similar to that obtained with four other disulfide bonds connecting helices 1 and 9, helices 5 and 6, helices 7 and 8, and helices 9 and 10 (4Duché D. Parker M.W. González-Mañas J.M. Pattus F. Baty D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6332-6339Google Scholar, 19Duché D. Baty D. Chartier M. Letellier L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24820-24825Google Scholar). In the second part of this paper, we have studied the effect of the disulfide bonds on the colicin A membrane insertion and channel opening in vitro. The results confirm that the pore formation includes at least two steps: a voltage-independent membrane insertion and a voltage-dependent channel opening. The disulfide bond that connects helices 3 and 9 did not prevent the colicin A membrane insertion but blocked the channel opening. The same result has been previously described with the disulfide bonds connecting helices 5 and 6, helices 7 and 8, and helices 9 and 10, respectively (4Duché D. Parker M.W. González-Mañas J.M. Pattus F. Baty D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6332-6339Google Scholar). In the following discussion, we will first analyze the implication of this work on the voltage-independent membrane insertion of colicin A into the membrane and how this is compatible with the umbrella model described by Parker et al. (3Parker M.W. Postma J.P.M. Pattus F. Tucker A. Tsernoglou D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 639-657Google Scholar, 8Parker M.W. Tucker A.D. Tsernoglou D. Pattus F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 126-129Google Scholar) and supported by experiments on colicin E1 (9Song H.Y. Cohen F.S. Cramer W.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2927-2934Google Scholar, 10Shin Y.-K. Levinthal C.

Duché D. González-Mañas J.-M. Baty D. Pattus F. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1055-1067Google Scholar) and supported by experiments on colicin A (12Jeanteur D. Pattus F. Timmins P.A. J. Mol.

The fluorescence quenching assay with brominated lipid vesicles has been analyzed in detail by González-Mañas et al. (20González-Mañas J.M. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7294-7300Google Scholar, 21González-Mañas J.M. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 625-633Google Scholar). This method detects the actual membrane insertion and not the adsorption of colicin to the vesicle surface. The charged amphipathic helices 3–7, which contain the three tryptophan residues of the pore-forming domain of colicin A, most probably sit in the membrane with the apolar region facing the hydrophobic core of the bilayer, exposing the fluorophores to the bromine, and the polar face in contact with the solvent protecting the tryptophans from soluble quenchers (21González-Mañas J.M. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 625-633Google Scholar, 33Lakey J.H. Massotte D. Heitz F. Faucon J.-F. Dasseux J.L. Parker M.W. Pattus F Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 169: 599-607Google Scholar). The two models considered that the voltage-independent membrane insertion is driven by the opening of the molecule extending helices 1 and 2 away from the other helices. In agreement with these models, locking helices 2 and 10 together prevents the colicin A membrane insertion, whereas locking helices 1 and 2 and helices 3 and 10 has no measurable effect on membrane insertion. The result obtained with the disulfide bond connecting helices 3 and 9 supports the penknife model. Indeed, the umbrella model predicts a large distance increase between helix 3 and 9 upon membrane insertion. This is not compatible with the ability of the H3/H9 mutant to insert into the membrane. In contrast, the penknife model suggests that the hydrophobic helices 8 and 9 remain close together with helices 3–7 and helix 10 upon membrane insertion. Our results confirm those obtained with the disulfide bonds previously introduced in the colicin A C-terminal domain. Indeed, the disulfide bonds that connect helices 1 and 9 prevented the colicin A membrane insertion, whereas the disulfide bonds that connect helices 5 and 6, helices 7 and 8, and helices 9 and 10 did not (4Duché D. Parker M.W. González-Mañas J.M. Pattus F. Baty D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6332-6339Google Scholar). In the presence of membrane potential, some helices of the colicin C-terminal domain insert into the membrane and form a conducting channel. Many studies have focused on the identification of the helices forming the open state of the channels (17Slatin S.L. Qiu X.Q. Jakes K.S. Finkelstein A. Nature. 1994; 371: 158-161Google Scholar, 26Izard J. Parker M.W. Chartier M. Duché D. Baty D. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1495-1500Google Scholar, 29Merrill A.R. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8529-8534Google Scholar, 34Qiu X.-Q. Jakes K.S. Finkelstein A. Slatin S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7483-7488Google Scholar). On the basis of biochemical labeling experiments, Merill and Cramer have proposed that the colicin E1 channel was formed by four helices, the hydrophobic helical hairpin and an amphipathic helical hairpin composed by helices 5 and 6 (29Merrill A.R. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8529-8534Google Scholar). This amphipathic helical hairpin has been identified as the voltage-sensitive segment. Subsequent experiments have confirmed this result (27Abrams C.K. Jakes K.S. Finkelstein A. Slatin S.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 77-93Google Scholar, 35Jakes K.S. Abrams C.K. Finkelstein A. Slatin S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6984-6991Google Scholar). Recently, Slatin et al. (17Slatin S.L. Qiu X.Q. Jakes K.S. Finkelstein A. Nature. 1994; 371: 158-161Google Scholar) have demonstrated that at least 31 amino acids of the colicin Ia C-terminal domain were translocated across the membrane after application of a trans-negative potential. This result indicates that the voltage gating is not only associated with the insertion of a helical hairpin into the membrane but also with the translocation of part of the protein across the membrane. The results obtained in this paper suggest that helices 1, 2, 3, and 10 remain at the membrane surface after application of a trans-negative voltage. Indeed, the disulfide bonds that connected helices 1 and 2 and helices 3 and 10 did not prevent the membrane insertion or the channel opening. In contrast, the disulfide bond between helices 3 and 9 did not prevent the membrane insertion but prevents the channel opening, suggesting that helix 9 should move away from helix 3 upon channel opening by the membrane potential. Probably, the helical hairpin (helices 8 and 9) becomes perpendicular to the plane of the lipid bilayer. The same interpretation could be given with the results obtained with the disulfide bonds connecting helices 9 and 10 and helices 7 and 8 (4Duché D. Parker M.W. González-Mañas J.M. Pattus F. Baty D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6332-6339Google Scholar) and could suggest that helix 7 is also at the membrane surface. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility of helix 7 forming part of the channel. Taking together these results, we can postulate that the open state of the colicin A channel is formed by four helices, helices 8 and 9 and helices 5 and 6. It has been previously described that the first three helices of the colicin A C-terminal domain were not involved in ion conduction through the channel (36Baty D. Lakey J. Pattus F. Lazdunski C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 409-413Google Scholar). According to this result, the two disulfide bonds connecting helices 1 and 2 and helices 3 and 10 did not prevent the in vitro channel opening of the toxin. However, these disulfide bonds blocked the in vivo activity of the colicin A without affecting its translocation through the E. coli envelope. Previous results have indicated that colicin A and Ia remained in contact with the outer membrane when they formed a channel in the inner membrane of sensitive cells (24Bénédetti H. Lloubès R. Lazdunski C. Letellier L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 441-447Google Scholar, 37Duché D. Letellier L. Géli V. Bénédetti H. Baty D. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4935-4939Google Scholar, 38Mel S.F. Falick A.M.

In order to explain the results obtained with the disulfide bonds connecting helices 1 and 2 and helices 3 and 10, we can speculate that helices 1, 2, and 3 span the periplasm of E. coli and connect the central domain of the toxin fixed to the outer membrane to helices 4–9 of the C-terminal domain inserted into the inner membrane.

(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 11723-11726). Moreover, we found that Rap1B as well as Ki-Ras and Ha-Ras stimulate the B-Raf activity. Since B-Raf contains a cysteine-rich domain originally found in protein kinase C as a domain responsible for interaction with phosphatidylserine (PS) and diacylglycerol or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, we have examined here the effect of these compounds on the Ki-Ras-, Ha-Ras-, and Rap1B-induced activation of bovine brain B-Raf. Bovine brain PS enhanced Ki-Ras-stimulated B-Raf activity. Phosphatidic acid was slightly active, but other phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol (PI), PI-4-monophosphate, PI-4,5-bisphosphate, and PI-3,4,5-trisphosphate, were inactive. However, none of the above phospholipids affected the Ha-Ras-stimulated B-Raf activity, whereas PI, PS, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidic acid inhibited the Rap1B-stimulated B-Raf activity. Phosphatidylcholine or PI-4-monophosphate did not show any effect on the Rap1B-stimulated B-Raf activity. Synthetic PS with two unsaturated fatty acids, such as 1,2-dioleoyl-PS or 1,2-dilinoleoyl-PS, showed the same effect toward the Ki-Ras- and Rap1B-stimulated B-Raf activities, but synthetic PS with two saturated fatty acids, such as 1,2-distearoyl-PS, was inactive. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate did not affect the stimulatory or inhibitory effect of PS on the Ki-Ras- and Rap1B-stimulated B-Raf activities, respectively. PS did not affect the Ki-Ras-, Ha-Ras-, or Rap1B-independent basal B-Raf activity or the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity. These results indicate that various phospholipids differently affect Ki-Ras-, Ha-Ras, and Rap1B-induced B-Raf activation.

Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Google Scholar), interacts with c-Raf-1 in a yeast two-hybrid system (12Zhang X.-F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Google Scholar), and the structure of a complex of Rap1A with the Ras-binding domain of c-Raf-1 has been determined by x-ray crystal structure analysis (22Nassar N. Horn G. Herrman C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether Rap1 affects Ras-dependent Raf activation. We have found that Rap1B as well as Ki-Ras and Ha-Ras stimulates the B-Raf activity and that Rap1B does not antagonize the Ras-stimulated B-Raf activity (23Ohtsuka T. Shimizu K. Yamamori B. Kuroda S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1258-1261Google Scholar). The Raf protein kinase family consists of c-Raf-1, A-Raf, and B-Raf in mammals (4Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.-W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Google Scholar). Raf is also evolutionally highly conserved in Drosophila (24Ambrosio L. Mahowald A.P. Perrimon N. Nature. 1989; 342: 288-291Google Scholar, 25Nishida Y. Hata M. Ayaki T. Ryo H. Yamagata M. Shimizu K. Nishizuka Y. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 775-781Google Scholar) and Caenorhabditis elegans (26Han M. Golden A. Han Y. Sternberg P.W. Nature. 1993; 363: 133-140Google Scholar). Structurally, Raf displays significant similarity to the PKC superfamily (27Kazanietz M.G. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Kolch W. Mischak H. Wong G. Pettit G.R. Bruns J.D. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11590-11594Google Scholar). The PKC superfamily is classified into three families, the conventional PKC, new PKC, and atypical PKC families (for a review, see 28Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Google Scholar). The conventional PKC family contains two cysteine-rich domains and one Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding domain; the former is responsible for its activation by diacylglycerol or tumor-promoting phorbol ester, such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, in the presence of anionic phospholipid. The latter is responsible for its activation by Ca2+ in the presence of anionic phospholipid, such as PS. The new PKC family contains two cysteine-rich domains responsible for its activation by diacylglycerol or tumor-promoting phorbol ester in the presence of anionic phospholipid (28Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Google Scholar). In contrast, the atypical PKC family contains only one cysteine-rich domain, but its activity is not affected by diacylglycerol or phorbol ester (28Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Google Scholar). PKCζ, a member of the atypical PKC family, has been shown to be enhanced by PS and PI-3,4,5-trisphosphate (29Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Google Scholar). Structurally, the Raf family resembles the atypical PKC family; it contains only one cysteine-rich domain in the amino-terminal region and a catalytic domain in the carboxyl-terminal region and lacks the Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding domain. Recently, it has been shown that c-Raf-1 binds to PS liposomes, although it does not bind to phorbol ester (30Ghosh S. Xie W.Q. Quest A.F.G. Mabrouk G.M. Strum J.C. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10000-10007Google Scholar), and that membrane phospholipid enhances the recombinant c-Raf-1 activity (31Dent P. Reardon D.E. Morrison D.K. Sturgill T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4125-4135Google Scholar). However, since a cell-free assay system for the Ras- or Rap1-dependent Raf activation was not available, phospholipid effect on the Ras- or Rap1-dependent Raf activation has not been studied. In this study, we have examined phospholipid effects on Ras- and Rap1-dependent B-Raf activation and found that PS further enhances Ki-Ras-stimulated, but not Ha-Ras-stimulated, B-Raf activation, and that PI, PS, and PE inhibit Rap1B-stimulated activation. Post-translationally lipid-modified Ki-Ras, Ha-Ras, and Rap1B were prepared as described (32Mizuno T. Kaibuchi K. Yamamoto T. Kawamura M. Sakoda T. Fujioka H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6442-6446Google Scholar). GST-MEK and GST-ERK2 were prepared as described (17Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Yamamori B. Matsuda S. Imazumi K. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2460-2465Google Scholar, 33Itoh T. Kaibuchi K. Masuda T. Yamamoto T. Matsuura Y. Maeda A. Shimizu K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3025-3028Google Scholar, 34Shimizu K.

GTPγS-Ki-Ras, GDP-Ki-Ras, GTPγS-Ha-Ras, GDP-Ha-Ras, GTPγS-Rap1B, and GDP-Rap1B were prepared as described (32Mizuno T. Kaibuchi K. Yamamoto T. Kawamura M. Sakoda T. Fujioka H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6442-6446Google Scholar). An anti-B-Raf polyclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and myelin basic protein were purchased from Sigma. PS, PI-4-monophosphate, and PI-4,5-bisphosphate were purchased from Sigma. PA, phosphatidylcholine, PE, and PI were purchased from Serdary Research Laboratories (Ontario, Canada). PI-3,4,5-trisphosphate was kindly provided by Dr. T. Takenawa (Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan). 1,2-Dioleoyl-PS, 1,2-dilinoleoyl-PS, and 1,2-distearoyl-PS were purchased from Funakoshi Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). The purity of the respective lipids was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography as described (35Herbette L. Blasie J.K. Defoor P. Fleischer S. Bick R.J. van Winkle W.B. Tate C.A. Entman M.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 234: 235-242Google Scholar, 36Horwitz J. Perlman R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 141: 169-175Google Scholar). The required amounts of phospholipids in chloroform were dried under a stream of N2, suspended in 20 mM Tris/HCl at pH 7.5 by vortexing, and sonicated for 30 s four times. The B-Raf activity was assayed by measuring the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein by recombinant GST-ERK2 in the presence of recombinant GST-MEK as described (17Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Yamamori B. Matsuda S. Imazumi K. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2460-2465Google Scholar, 18Yamamori B. Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Fukui K. Ohtsuka T. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22917-22920Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 µl of GTPγS-Ki-Ras, GTPγS-Ha-Ras, or GTPγS-Rap1B, 15 µl of B-Raf, and 5 µl of phospholipid to be tested were mixed in this order. The concentrations of these compounds used were indicated in each experiment. After 15 µl of GST-MEK and 10 µl of a reaction mixture containing 120 µM ATP were added, incubation was continued for 10 min at 30°C. After the incubation, 10 µl of GST-ERK2 was added and the incubation was continued for a further 20 min at 30°C. Then 20 µl of a reaction mixture containing 100 µM [γ-32P]ATP (300 cpm/pmol) and 220 µM myelin basic protein was added. After further incubation for 10 min at 30°C, 30 µl of the mixture were spotted onto a phosphocellulose paper sheet. The sheet was washed with 75 mM phosphoric acid, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Bovine brain B-Raf was purified as described (18Yamamori B. Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Fukui K. Ohtsuka T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11723-11726Google Scholar). Briefly, bovine brain cytosol was subjected to Mono S column chromatography and the active fractions were collected. They were subjected to Mono Q column chromatography, and the active fractions were collected. These fractions, containing B-Raf complexed with 14–3–3 proteins, were used. Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as a standard protein by the method of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). The effect of various phospholipids on GTPγS-Ki-Ras-, GTPγS-Ha-Ras-, and GTPγS-Rap1B-dependent B-Raf activation was first examined. In the presence of GTPγS-Ki-Ras, PS synergistically stimulated B-Raf activity (Fig. 1A). PA slightly stimulated it, but other phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine, PE, PI, and PI-4-monophosphate, did not. The Ka value for PS in the presence of GTPγS-Ki-Ras, giving a half-maximal activation, was about 12.5 µg/ml. In the absence of GTPγS-Ki-Ras, PS was not active. The other phospholipids were also inactive. PI-4,5-bisphosphate and PI-3,4,5-trisphosphate were inactive irrespective of the presence and absence of GTPγS-Ki-Ras (data not shown). When similar experiments were performed with GTPγS-Ha-Ras, none of the phospholipids examined affected the B-Raf activity (Fig. 1B). When similar experiments were done with GTPγS-Rap1B, PI inhibited the Rap1B-stimulated B-Raf activity (Fig. 1C). PS and PE also inhibited it, but they were slightly less active than PI. PA slightly inhibited it. The other phospholipids were inactive. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate did not affect the B-Raf activity irrespective of the presence and absence of GTPγS-Ki-Ras, GTPγS-Ha-Ras, GTPγS-Rap1B, and PS (data not shown). The effect of PS in the presence of various concentrations of GTPγS-Ki-Ras and GTPγS-Rap1B was next examined. In the presence of PS, Ki-Ras stimulated the B-Raf activity in a dose-dependent manner (18Yamamori B. Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Fukui K. Ohtsuka T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11723-11726Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). PS enhanced the maximal Ki-Ras-stimulated B-Raf activity but did not affect the Ka value for GTPγS-Ki-Ras. The Ka values for GTPγS-Ki-Ras in the presence and absence of PS were the same, about 12.5 nM. On the other hand, in the absence of PS, Rap1B stimulated the B-Raf activity in a dose-dependent manner (23Ohtsuka T. Shimizu K. Yamamori B. Kuroda S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1258-1261Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B), whereas, in the presence of PS, the Rap1B-stimulated B-Raf activity was markedly inhibited. The PS examined above was a pure sample obtained from bovine brain. The effect of synthetic phospholipids on GTPγS-Ki-Ras-and GTPγS-Rap1B-dependent B-Raf activation was then examined. Synthetic PS with two unsaturated fatty acids, such as 1,2-dioleoyl-PS or 1,2-dilinoleoyl-PS, stimulated GTPγS-Ki-Ras-dependent B-Raf activation (Fig. 3A). 1,2-Dilinoleoyl-PS was slightly less active than 1,2-dioleoyl-PS. On the other hand, synthetic PS with two saturated fatty acids, such as 1,2-distearoyl-PS, was inactive. When similar experiments were performed with GTPγS-Rap1B, synthetic PS with two unsaturated fatty acids, such as 1,2-dioleoyl-PS or 1,2-dilinoleoyl-PS, inhibited GTPγS-Rap1B-dependent B-Raf activation (Fig. 3B). Synthetic PS with two saturated fatty acids, such as 1,2-distearoyl-PS, was inactive. In the absence of B-Raf, PS did not stimulate the GST-MEK or GST-ERK2 activity irrespective of the presence or absence of GTPγS-Ki-Ras (Table I). The basal activity in the B-Raf fraction may not be derived from any contaminating kinase but possibly from B-Raf itself, because the activity was eliminated by immunodepletion of B-Raf by an anti-B-Raf antibody (data not shown). Moreover, PS did not affect the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein in the absence of GST-MEK.Table I.Effect of PS on MEK, ERK, and B-Raf activitiesMBP phosphorylation−aIndicates −PS or +PS.+aIndicates −PS or +PS.−bIndicates −GTPγS-Ki-Ras or +GTPγS-Ki-Ras and −PS.+bIndicates −GTPγS-Ki-Ras or +GTPγS-Ki-Ras and −PS.−cIndicates −GTPγS-Ki-Ras or +GTPγS-Ki-Ras and +PS.+cIndicates −GTPγS-Ki-Ras or +GTPγS-Ki-Ras and +PS.cpmB-Raf + MEK + ERK16,65038,85016,25069,950MEK + ERK9301,0509901,100B-Raf + ERK3,2703,4503,3303,770a Indicates −PS or +PS.b Indicates −GTPγS-Ki-Ras or +GTPγS-Ki-Ras and −PS.c Indicates −GTPγS-Ki-Ras or +GTPγS-Ki-Ras and +PS. Open table in a new tab We have shown that, of the various phospholipids examined, PS, PI, PA, and PE showed different effects on Ki-Ras-, Ha-Ras-, and Rap1B-dependent B-Raf activation. For instance, PS stimulated Ki-Ras-dependent B-Raf activation, whereas PS inhibited the Rap1B-dependent B-Raf activation and showed no effect on Ha-Ras-dependent B-Raf activation. Although it has recently been shown that c-Raf-1 binds to PS liposomes (30Ghosh S. Xie W.Q. Quest A.F.G. Mabrouk G.M. Strum J.C. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10000-10007Google Scholar), we have shown here that no phospholipid, including PS, affects the basal activity of B-Raf in the absence of small GTP-binding proteins. Moreover, we have found that PS does not affect the MEK or ERK activity. Therefore, these results suggest that the effective phospholipids do not affect the downstream molecules of B-Raf and that they do not simply interact with B-Raf alone to affect its enzymatic activity. It is possible that the effective phospholipids interact with Ki-Ras or Rap1B alone or their complex with B-Raf so that the small GTP-binding protein-stimulated B-Raf activity is modulated. It is currently unknown which is the case. We have, moreover, shown here that synthetic PS with two unsaturated fatty acids, such as 1,2-dioleoyl-PS or 1,2-dilinoleoyl-PS, affects Ki-Ras- and Rap1B-dependent B-Raf activation, but synthetic PS with two saturated fatty acids, such as 1,2-distearoyl-PS, is inactive. These results suggest that not only the polar head groups of phospholipids but also their acyl moieties are important for affecting Ki-Ras and Rap1B-dependent B-Raf activation. However, the precise mechanism of how the effective phospholipids affect Ki-Ras- and Rap1B-dependent B-Raf activation remains to be clarified. Ki-Ras, Ha-Ras, and Rap1B are bound to membrane phospholipids through their C-terminal regions (for a review, see 38Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Google Scholar). In the case of Ki-Ras, the farnesyl moiety and the clustered basic amino acids are important for Ki-Ras to interact with the plasma membrane. Ha-Ras interacts with the plasma membrane through the farnesyl and palmitoyl moieties, and Rap1B interacts with the plasma membrane through the geranylgeranyl moiety and the clustered basic amino acids. The GDP-bound form of Ki-Ras and Ha-Ras is activated by conversion to the GTP-bound form on the plasma membrane by the action of GDP/GTP exchange proteins such as SOS and Cdc25 (for a review, see 39McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 71-76Google Scholar). SOS is activated by Grb2, which interacts with the tyrosine kinase-type membrane receptors, such as platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptors (39McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 71-76Google Scholar), whereas Cdc25 is activated by the Ca2+-calmodulin complex in cortical neurons (40Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Google Scholar). The GDP-bound form of Rap1B has recently been shown to be converted to the GTP-bound form on the plasma membrane by the action of C3G, which is activated by the action of Crk (41Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Google Scholar, 42Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Google Scholar). Crk is shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated by c-Abl, BCR/Abl, and insulin-like growth factor I receptor (43Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Google Scholar, 44ten Hoeve J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5187-5190Google Scholar). It has been shown, on the other hand, that, when Ras is activated by membrane receptors, c-Raf-1 is translocated from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and that the artificial attachment of the CAAX box to c-Raf-1, which makes c-Raf-1 undergo lipid modifications, causes its translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and its subsequent activation by some membrane factors even in the absence of Ras activation (46Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Google Scholar, 47Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Google Scholar). On the basis of these observations, it has been proposed that the GTP-bound form of Ras produced on the plasma membrane plays a role just in recruiting c-Raf-1 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where it is activated by some factors in the plasma membrane different from Ras. However, we have previously shown that Ki-Ras, Ha-Ras, and Rap1B activate purified B-Raf even in the absence of any membrane components (16Itoh T. Kaibuchi K. Masuda T. Yamamoto T. Matsuura Y. Maeda A. Shimizu K. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 975-979Google Scholar, 18Yamamori B. Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Fukui K. Ohtsuka T. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Gelb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26347-26351Google Scholar), and we have shown here that this activation is differently affected by membrane phospholipids and that any membrane phospholipids alone thus far studied do not affect the basal B-Raf activity in the absence of small GTP-binding proteins. It is not known whether B-Raf as well as c-Raf-1 is translocated from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, when Ras is activated by membrane receptors. It has not been shown either that purified c-Raf-1 is activated by Ras or Rap1 in a cell-free system free from any membrane components. However, our earlier and present results suggest that, when Ras or Rap1 is activated on the plasma membrane, c-Raf-1 or B-Raf is recruited to the plasma membrane, where they are activated by the GTP-bound form of Ras or Rap1, and that this activation is modulated differently by various phospholipids of the plasma membrane. Further studies are necessary to establish whether phospholipid plays this role in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W2154214219,"Fibronectin has been shown to bind to integrin αIIbβ3 in Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-dependent and -independent manners. A recent study has indicated that a 29-kDa dispase-digestive fragment from the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of human plasma fibronectin (lacking RGD sequence) inhibits binding of fibronectin to thrombin-stimulated platelets and ADP-induced aggregation (Tanabe, J., Fujita, H., Iwamatsu, A., Mohri, H., and Ohkubo, T. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 27143-27147). We provide here the evidence that a peptide corresponding to residues from Ala1704 to Glu1718 (designated F1) from this fragment inhibited binding of 125I-labeled 29-kDa fragment of fibronectin to thrombin-stimulated platelets and ADP-induced aggregation. The F1 peptide bound directly to αIIbβ3 integrin receptor. These results indicate that a novel binding site in the C-terminal heparin-binding region of fibronectin is localized within the residues from Ala1704 to Glu1718. Binding of 125I-labeled 29-kDa fragment of fibronectin to thrombin-stimulated platelets was not inhibited by RGDS peptide and the 12-residue peptide from the cell-binding domain of fibronectin, suggesting that binding site in the C-terminal heparin-binding domain may be different from those of RGDS and the 12-residue peptide. This additional αIIbβ3-binding domain(s) in fibronectin may also play some role for prevention of thrombus formation by direct interaction with αIIbβ3.

Adhesion and aggregation of platelets involve the specific interactions of platelet membrane glycoproteins with adhesive molecules in plasma or subendothelium or with those released from platelet α-granules. The interaction of von Willebrand factor with platelet membrane glycoprotein Ib is crucial for the initiation of platelet adhesion (1Weiss H.J. Hawiger J. Ruggeri Z.M. Turitto V.T. Thiagarajan P. Hoffman T. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 288-297Google Scholar, 2Ikeda Y. Handa M. Kawano K. Kamata T. Murata M. Araki Y. Ando H. Kawai Y. Watanabe K. Itagaki I. Sakai K. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1234-1240Google Scholar). Platelet integrin receptor of αIIbβ3 is widely recognized as a receptor for fibrinogen, which is thought to link the aggregating platelets together (3Parise L.V. Philips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10698-10707Google Scholar). Other adhesive proteins, including fibronectin, may also contribute to platelet adhesion (4Houdijk W.P.M. Sakariassen K.S. Nievelstein P.F.E.M. Sixma J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 531-540Google Scholar, 5Parise L.V. Philips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14011-14017Google Scholar) and aggregation (6Mohri H. Ohkubo T. Peptides (Elmsford). 1993; 14: 861-865Google Scholar) by interaction with αIIbβ3. Previous studies have indicated that fibronectin has a capacity to bind to αIIbβ3 in a divalent cation-dependent manner (7Gardner J.M. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1985; 42: 439-448Google Scholar, 8Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9477-9482Google Scholar). Binding of fibronectin to platelets also was inhibited by anti-αIIbβ3 monoclonal antibodies (9Plow E.F. McEver R.P. Coller B.S. Woods V. Marguerie G.A. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 1985; 66: 724-727Google Scholar) and by short peptides (10Ginsberg M.H. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Marguerie G.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3931-3936Google Scholar, 11Gartner T.K. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11891-11894Google Scholar). These short peptides contain a sequence of Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) from the cell-binding domain of fibronectin (12Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Google Scholar). Furthermore, RGD-containing peptides also block binding of fibronectin to unstimulated platelets (13Piotrowicz R.S. Yamada K.M. Kunicki T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1359-1364Google Scholar). These studies suggest that binding of fibronectin to αIIbβ3 is mediated mainly by RGDS sequence. Recently, additional binding site(s) in fibronectin to αIIbβ3 have been demonstrated in an RGD-independent manner (14Bowditch R.D. Halloran C.E. Aota S. Obara M. Plow E.F. Yamada K.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23323-23328Google Scholar, 15Tanabe J. Fujita H. Iwamatsu A. Mohri H. Ohkubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27143-27147Google Scholar). One site is located in the N-terminal region of the cell-binding domain of fibronectin corresponding to the residues from Ile1359 to Ser1436. This recombinant fragment of fibronectin inhibited binding of fibronectin to αIIbβ3 and ADP-induced platelet aggregation (14Bowditch R.D. Halloran C.E. Aota S. Obara M. Plow E.F. Yamada K.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23323-23328Google Scholar). Further studies using synthetic peptides have shown that a novel binding site to αIIbβ3 in this region is located within the residues from His1377 to Ile1382 (16Bowditch R.D. Hariharan M. Tominna E.F. Smith J.W. Yamada K.M. Getzoff E.D. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10856-10863Google Scholar, 17Mohri H. Tanabe J. Katoh K. Okubo T. Peptides (Elmsford). 1995; 16: 263-268Google Scholar). The other additional binding site to αIIbβ3 has been demonstrated in a monomeric 29-kDa dispase-digestive fragment from the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin corresponding to residues from Ala1597 to Glu1963 (15Tanabe J. Fujita H. Iwamatsu A. Mohri H. Ohkubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27143-27147Google Scholar). This fragment lacks RGD sequence, inhibits binding of fibronectin to thrombin-stimulated platelets as well as heparin and ADP-induced platelet aggregation and binds to immobilized αIIbβ3. These results suggest that three different binding sites in fibronectin may involve the interaction with platelets and that fibronectin may also play some role in thrombosis formation and/or prevention. For the present series of experiments, the entire sequence of the 29-kDa fragment of fibronectin corresponding to residues 1597-1963 was reproduced with synthetic peptides. A novel 15-residue peptide corresponding to residues from Ala1704 to Glu1718 (designated F1) from the 29-kDa fragment in the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin was identified to bind directly to αIIbβ3 and to inhibit both fibronectin and fibrinogen bindings. Moreover, the binding site of this peptide on αIIbβ3 might be different from those of RGDS and the sequence in the N-terminal region of cell-binding domain of fibronectin. These peptides will be then used to probe the structural and functional organization of the domains of fibronectin to αIIbβ3. Human plasma fibronectin was purchased from Bachen Chemical Co. Ltd. (Torrance, CA). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Na125I was purchased from Amersham Corp. Anti-αIIbβ3 monoclonal antibody (designated LJ-CP8), which inhibits binding of fibrinogen to αIIbβ3 (18Lombardo V.T. Hodson E. Roberts J.R. Kunicki T.J. Zimmerman T.S. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1950-1958Google Scholar), was obtained from the Scripps Institute (La Jolla, CA). Polyclonal antibody against purified αIIbβ3 was raised in rabbits. This antibody reacted with two main bands of relative molecular mass 140 and 90 kDa, similar to those of αIIb and β3 (data not shown). Immunoglobulin G was purified from ascitic fluid and serum by affinity chromatography on protein A-Sepharose CL-6B (Sigma) as described previously (19Ey P.L. Prowse S.J. Jenkin C.R. Immunochemistry. 1978; 15: 91-93Google Scholar). Generation and characterization of a monomeric 29-kDa dispase-digestive fragment of human fibronecitn has been described elsewhere (15Tanabe J. Fujita H. Iwamatsu A. Mohri H. Ohkubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27143-27147Google Scholar, 20Fujita H. Mohri H. Kanamori H. Iwamatsu A. Okubo T. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 484-489Google Scholar). In brief, fibronectin was incubated with dispase (0.3 mg/mg of fibronectin: neutral protease, grade I, Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) for 6 h at 22°C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 0.01 M EDTA. The 29-kDa fragment was purified by affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose CL-6B. αIIbβ3 was purified from fresh platelets by KYGRGDS-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described elsewhere (21Lam S.C.- Plow E.F. Smith M.A. Andrieux A. Rockwaert J.-J. Marguerie G. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 947-950Google Scholar). Purified αIIbβ3 was characterized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and immunoblotting. A comparison of published amino acid sequence (22Peterson T.E. Thogersen H.C. Skorstengaard K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Sahl P. Sottrup-Jensen L. Magnusson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 137-141Google Scholar, 23Schwarzbauer J.E. Tamkun J.W. Lemischka I.R. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1983; 35: 421-431Google Scholar) from the entire sequence of the 29-kDa fragment of fibronectin corresponding to residues from Ala1597 to Glu1963 is shown in Fig. 1. Peptides were synthesized at TANA Bio-System LC, using a peptide synthesizer (Houston, TX). A 12-residue peptide in the cell-binding domain of fibronectin (Arg-Glu-Asp-Arg-Val-Pro-His-Ser-Arg-Asn-Ser-Ile; REDRVPHSRNSI) that inhibited binding of fibronectin to αIIbβ3 was also synthesized at TANA Biosystem LC. Peptides RGDS, RGES, and GQQHHLGGAKQAKGDV at the C terminus of the fibrinogen chain were purchased from Bachem Fine Chemicals, Inc. (Torrance, CA). Lyophilized crude peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC 1The abbreviation used is: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. on a C-18 column, using elution gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The purity and composition of the peptides was verified by HPLC analysis of hydrolysates prepared by treating the peptides under nitrogen in 6 N HCl containing 0.1% phenol at 160°C. high performance liquid chromatography. Blood from medication-free healthy volunteers was drawn through a 19-gauge needle into acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD) anticoagulant and centrifuged at 200 × g to obtain platelet-rich plasma. The platelets were washed by albumin density-gradient technique described elsewhere (24Walsh P.N. Mills D.C.B. White J.G. Br. J. Haematol. 1977; 36: 281-287Google Scholar). Washed platelets were resuspended in modified Tyrode's buffer (5 mM HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 12 mM NaHCO3, 5.5 mM glucose), pH 7.3, containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Purified proteins were labeled with carrier-free 125I (Amersham Corp.) using IODO-GEN (Pierce) according to the method described by Fracker and Speck (25Fracker D.J. Speck J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-856Google Scholar). Unbound reagent was removed by gel filtration on a 0.5 × 20-cm column of Sepharose G-25 equilibrated with TBS (20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.3). Peptides (20 mg) were cross-linked to 1 ml of CNBr-activated CL 4B-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The remaining active sites on the Sepharose were blocked with 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Platelets were isolated from 40 ml of fresh blood. After the platelets were pelleted at 1,500 × g for 10 min and were washed six times in 0.05 M citrate buffer, pH 6.2. Platelets resuspended in citrate buffer were biotinylated by addition of 100 µl of 0.1 M biotin-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) in dimethyl sulfoxide, and incubated at 22°C for 2 h with gentle rocking. 100 µl of 1 M NH4Cl was added, and the platelets were further incubated for 15 min. The platelets were centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 5 min. Pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of platelet lysis buffer consisting of 10 mM HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 50 mM n-octyl-D-glucopyranoside, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µM leupeptin, 1 mg/ml N-ethylmaleimide, pH 7.4, and incubated for 16 h at 4. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min and 2 ml of supernatant loaded onto 1 ml of active peptide (designated F1) affinity, control peptide (a scrambled version of F1) affinity, or control Sepharose columns. The columns were incubated 16 h at 4°C with gentle agitation. The columns were washed five times with platelet lysis buffer and eluted with platelet lysis buffer containing 10 mM EDTA. Samples were analyzed by 7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transfer to nitrocellulose, and visualization of biotinylated proteins using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacture's directions. Blotting of eluted platelet membrane protein to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) was performed according to the technique of Towbin et al. (26Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar) with some modifications (27Hashimoto Y. Tanabe J. Mohri H. Ohkubo T. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1994; 101: 370-374Google Scholar). Binding of the 29-kDa fragment of fibronectin to thrombin-stimulated washed platelets was performed as described previously (8Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9477-9482Google Scholar) with some modification. In brief, washed platelets (final concentration: 1 × 108/ml) were activated by thrombin at a concentration of 0.1 unit/ml in the presence of 1.0 mM CaCl2. Following incubation for 10 min at 22°C, thrombin activity was blocked with a 30-fold excess of hirudin (Sigma). Various concentrations of ligand and labeled protein (the 29-kDa fragment of fibronectin, 20 µg/ml; fibronectin, 5 µg/ml; or fibrinogen, 10 µg/ml) were then added. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 22°C without agitation. The interaction was quantitated by separating bound from free ligand by centrifugation through 20% sucrose solution at 12,000 × g for 4 min. Binding was expressed as a percentage of that measured in a control mixture in the absence of inhibitor, after subtracting the nonspecific binding. Nonspecific binding was evaluated in each experiment by adding a 50-fold excess of unlabeled ligand. The concentration of a competing substance required to inhibit specific binding by 50% (IC50) was then calculated from dose-response curves in which the percentage of residual binding was plotted against the logarithm of competing ligand concentration. Platelet aggregation was carried out in siliconized cuvettes as described previously (28Mohri H. Am. J. Hematol. 1986; 22: 391-401Google Scholar) using an NNK platelet aggregation tracer (Nikkou Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan) and Unicorder U-626 DS (Nippon Denshi Kagaku, Tokyo, Japan) at 37°C and stirred at 1,000 rpm. Purified fibrinogen (0.5 mg/ml, 1.5 µM) and CaCl2 (1.0 mM) were added to washed platelets (3 × 108/ml) together with various concentrations of synthetic peptides. ADP (5 × 10−6µM) was then added. Aggregation was recorded as the increase in the light transmission through the mixture. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed as described previously (29Berlinger S. Niiya K. Roberts J.R. Hougten R.A. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7500-7505Google Scholar). Polystyrene microtiter wells were coated overnight with purified αIIbβ3 at a final concentration of 2 µg/ml (100 µl/well) in a pH 7.4 buffer containing 0.04 M phosphate, 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2. Purified IgG, at a concentration sufficient to give an optical density of approximately 1.0, was incubated with various concentrations of fibronectin, the 29-kDa fragment, or synthetic peptides. The mixture was then added to the αIIbβ3-coated wells and incubated for 1 h at 22°C. The wells were washed three times with a pH 7.4 buffer containing 0.04 M phosphate, 0.15 M NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (phosphate-buffered saline/Nonidet P-40) and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Zymed, Inc., San Francisco, CA; 1:500 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline/Nonidet P-40) for 1 h at 22°C. The wells were washed three times, the peroxidase substrate (O-phenylenediamine, Zymed) was added, and the absorbance at 492 nm was recorded. Protein concentrations were measured by Bradford's method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Peptides were sometimes poorly soluble; a macroscopic sediment could be seen following centrifugation of the solution at 12,000 × g for 5 min. For this reason, the actual peptide concentration was measured using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. A dispase-digestive 29-kDa fragment of human fibronectin extending from Ala1597 to Glu1963 bound to αIIbβ3 in a divalent cation-dependent manner (15Tanabe J. Fujita H. Iwamatsu A. Mohri H. Ohkubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27143-27147Google Scholar). To identify a minimal peptide ligand that participates in recognition of αIIbβ3, 22 synthetic peptides spanning this region were synthesized. Twenty of these peptides were soluble in aqueous buffers, and we tested their capacity to inhibit binding of the 125I-labeled 29-kDa fragment of fibronectin to thrombin-stimulated platelets at two different concentrations. A solution of peptide comprised of Ala-Thr-Glu-Thr-Thr-Ile-Thr-Ile-Ser-Trp-Arg-Thr-Lys-Thr-Glu (ATETTITISWRTKTE), corresponding to residues Ala1704 to Glu1718 (designated F1), was found to inhibit binding of the 29-kDa fragment to thrombin-stimulated platelets. In contrast, other peptides tested did not substantially block binding of the 29-kDa fragment to thrombin-stimulated platelets (Fig. 1). A dose-dependent inhibitory study showed that F1 peptide inhibited this interaction with IC50 of 280 ± 35 µM. To verify the specificity of F1 peptide binding to thrombin-stimulated platelets, we then synthesized a scrambled version of the F1 peptide, which was comprised of Thr-Ile-Lys-Ile-Ser-Glu-Thr-Thr-Thr-Ala-Try-Glu-Thr-Arg-Thr (TIKISETTTAWETRT), as a negative control peptide. This control peptide inhibited neither binding of the 29-kDa fragment nor that of fibronectin to thrombin-stimulated platelets. RGDS peptide and the 12-residue peptide from the cell-binding domain of fibronectin (residues 1371-1382) had no effect on the 29-kDa fragment binding to thrombin-stimulated platelets (Fig. 2A), although these two peptides indeed inhibited interaction of fibronectin to αIIbβ3 with IC50 values of 2.6 ± 0.7 and 92 ± 12 µM (Fig. 2B). Then the effect of these peptides on ADP-induced platelet aggregation was evaluated. Peptide F1 inhibited ADP-induced aggregation of platelets in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of approximately 50% was achieved at a 810 ± 56 µM. RGDS and the 12-residue peptide from the cell-binding domain of fibronectin also inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation (Fig. 3). However, the control peptide of a scrambled version of F1 peptide did not inhibit ADP-induced aggregation (data not shown). It should be noted that the RGDS peptide was the most potent inhibitor of ADP-induced aggregation. Inhibitory effects of these peptides on binding of fibrinogen to thrombin-stimulated platelets support the aggregation studies. These three peptides inhibited binding of fibrinogen to thrombin-stimulated platelets in a dose-dependent manner, while the control peptide (a scrambled version of F1 peptide) did not (Fig. 2C). F1 peptide, the 12-residue peptide of the cell-binding domain and RGDS inhibited fibrinogen binding with IC50 values of 108 ± 21, 48 ± 7.6, and 1.2 ± 0.4 µM, respectively. The RGDS peptide was the most potent inhibitory effect on this binding. To evaluate the integrin receptor on platelets to peptide F1, a detergent extract of platelets applied to immobilized F1 peptide and the bound proteins eluted with EDTA. Polypeptides matching the apparent Mr for αIIb (140 kDa) and β3 (90 kDa) were specifically eluted. These proteins were not detected after EDTA elution of a scrambled F1 peptide column or a control Sepharose column (Fig. 4A). Moreover, Western blot analysis using anti-αIIbβ3 polyclonal antibody showed that the elute from immobilized F1 peptide was indeed αIIbβ3 (Fig. 4B). A selected monoclonal antibody (LJ-CP8) has recognized and inhibited binding of fibrinogen to αIIbβ3 (18Lombardo V.T. Hodson E. Roberts J.R. Kunicki T.J. Zimmerman T.S. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1950-1958Google Scholar). We examined a capacity of fibronectin, the 29-kDa fragment of fibronectin, or synthetic peptides to inhibit binding of LJ-CP8 to immobilized αIIbβ3 (Fig. 5A). Preincubation of fibronectin or the 29-kDa fragment of fibronectin showed dose-dependent inhibitory effect on antibody binding to immobilized αIIbβ3. The results were the same when synthetic peptides, including F1, RGDS, and the γ chain peptide of fibrinogen, were used, although the inhibitory activity was less potent. The control peptide of the scrambled version of F1 peptide had no effect on this interaction (Fig. 5B). In this study, we have studied the interaction of synthetic peptides derived from the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin with integrin receptor αIIbβ3. There are three key findings: (a) an active binding site of the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin that inhibited binding of the 29-kDa fragment to αIIbβ3 was a sequence corresponding to the residues from Ala1704 to Glu1718; (b) a peptide including this binding site (designated F1) inhibited both bindings of fibronectin and fibrinogen to αIIbβ3 in a dose-dependent manner; (c) a binding site of this peptide on αIIbβ3 may be different from that of RGDS and of the 12-residue peptide in the cell-binding domain of fibronectin. Recent studies indicate that multiple sites in fibronectin are involved in its recognition by αIIbβ3 (14Bowditch R.D. Halloran C.E. Aota S. Obara M. Plow E.F. Yamada K.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23323-23328Google Scholar, 15Tanabe J. Fujita H. Iwamatsu A. Mohri H. Ohkubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27143-27147Google Scholar, 31Ginsberg M.H. McDonagh J. Fibronectin: Its Role in Coagulation and Fibrinolysis. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1986: 86Google Scholar). A major binding site of fibronectin to stimulated platelets is believed to be the RGD sequence, or a closely related sequence (31Ginsberg M.H. McDonagh J. Fibronectin: Its Role in Coagulation and Fibrinolysis. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1986: 86Google Scholar), that interacts directly with β3 (32Ginsberg M.H. Painter R.G. Forsyth J. Birdwell C. Plow E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1049-1053Google Scholar). RGD-independent binding sites to αIIbβ3 have been demonstrated in the cell-binding domain of fibronectin corresponding to residues 1359-1436 (14Bowditch R.D. Halloran C.E. Aota S. Obara M. Plow E.F. Yamada K.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23323-23328Google Scholar) and in the 29-kDa fragment localized in the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin (15Tanabe J. Fujita H. Iwamatsu A. Mohri H. Ohkubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27143-27147Google Scholar). These binding sites also inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation (14Bowditch R.D. Halloran C.E. Aota S. Obara M. Plow E.F. Yamada K.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23323-23328Google Scholar, 15Tanabe J. Fujita H. Iwamatsu A. Mohri H. Ohkubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27143-27147Google Scholar). As the RGD-independent binding domains to platelets are present in fibronectin, the novel integrin recognition sites should be clarified. Studies using synthetic peptides showed that the integrin recognition site in the cell-binding domain of fibronectin is located within the residues His1377-Thr1383 (16Bowditch R.D. Hariharan M. Tominna E.F. Smith J.W. Yamada K.M. Getzoff E.D. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10856-10863Google Scholar, 17Mohri H. Tanabe J. Katoh K. Okubo T. Peptides (Elmsford). 1995; 16: 263-268Google Scholar). This novel recognition sequence inhibited binding of fibronectin to αIIbβ3 as well as ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Moreover, recognition of the His1377-Thr1383 in fibronectin may involve the αIIb subunit (16Bowditch R.D. Hariharan M. Tominna E.F. Smith J.W. Yamada K.M. Getzoff E.D. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10856-10863Google Scholar). A similar situation exists in fibrinogen, in which RGDS, RGDF, and γ 400–411 peptides compete with one other for binding to αIIbβ3 (21Lam S.C.- Plow E.F. Smith M.A. Andrieux A. Rockwaert J.-J. Marguerie G. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 947-950Google Scholar, 33Santoro S.A. Lawing Jr., W.J. Cell. 1987; 48: 867-873Google Scholar, 34Mohri H. Ohkubo T. Peptides (Elmsford). 1993; 14: 353-357Google Scholar). γ 400–411 peptides have been shown by chemical cross-linking to bind in close proximity to the αIIb subunit (33Santoro S.A. Lawing Jr., W.J. Cell. 1987; 48: 867-873Google Scholar), and the RGD cross-linking site has been located at the β3 corresponding to residues 109–171, which was close to the second calcium-binding site (35D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Lam S.C.- Plow E.F. Science. 1988; 242: 91-93Google Scholar) and residues 211–221 (36Steiner B. Trzeciak A. Pfenninger G. Kouns W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6870-6873Google Scholar). The present study showed that a novel synthetic peptide corresponding to the residues from Ala1704 to Glu1718 (designated F1) inhibited binding of the 29-kDa fragment of fibronectin to thrombin-stimulated platelets as well as ADP-induced aggregation of platelets. Our platelet aggregation study indicates that this novel peptide can bind to fibrinogen receptors as well as fibronectin receptors. Inhibition of fibrinogen binding by this peptide also provides evidence that this region of fibronectin has an ability to binds to fibrinogen receptor. F1 novel synthetic peptide inhibited binding of anti-αIIbβ3 monoclonal antibody to immobilized αIIbβ3, which indicates that the receptor of this peptide is αIIbβ3. However, differences were found in the ability of three synthetic peptides (F1 peptide, RGDS, the 12-residue peptide) to inhibit binding of the 29-kDa fragment of fibronectin to thrombin-stimulated platelets. RGDS and the 12-residue peptide did not substantially inhibit this binding. The evidence strongly suggests that binding site in the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin to thrombin-stimulated platelets may be quite different from that of RGDS and of the 12-residue peptide in the cell-binding domain of fibronectin, even though the receptor is αIIbβ3. The 29-kDa fragment of fibronectin also interacts with proteoglycans and α4β1 integrin (37Iida J. Skubitz A.P.N. Furcht L.T. Wayner E.A. McCarthy J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 431-444Google Scholar, 38McCarthy J.B. Skubitz A.P.N. Zhao Q. Yi X.-Y. Mickelson D.J. Klein D.J. Furcht L.T. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 777-787Google Scholar). Indeed, a sequence corresponding to residues from Thr1705 to Ser1712 (TETTITIS) in the F1 peptide has been indicated a region to be required for an unusual heparin binding (39Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Migliori M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 242-246Google Scholar). Binding sites to integrin α4β1 in the C-terminal heparin-binding domains of fibronectin identified previously (38McCarthy J.B. Skubitz A.P.N. Zhao Q. Yi X.-Y. Mickelson D.J. Klein D.J. Furcht L.T. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 777-787Google Scholar, 40Mould A.P. Humphries M.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4089-4095Google Scholar) are quite different from that to αIIbβ3 presented here. A direct comparison of fibronectin recognition specificity of αIIbβ3 and α4β1 will be of interest. In conclusion, our present studies demonstrate that a novel RGD-independent binding site to αIIbβ3 in the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin is located in a sequence corresponding to residues Ala1704-Glu1718. Definition of αIIbβ3 binding sites in fibronectin may be useful for understanding the mechanism of formation and/or prevention of thrombosis. Our results may provide clues for future efforts aimed at more precisely the chemical bases of fibronectin involved in platelet thrombus formation."
