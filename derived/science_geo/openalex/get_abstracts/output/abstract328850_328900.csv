https://openalex.org/W4237391075,"Although the concept of an artificial photosynthetic reaction center that mimics natural electron-and energy-transfer processes is an old one, in recent years major advances have occurred. In this review, some relatively simple molecular dyads that mimic certain aspects of photosynthetic electron transfer and singlet or triplet energy transfer are described. Dyads of this type have proven to be extremely useful for elucidating basic photochemical principles. In addition, their limitations, particularly in the area of temporal stabilization of electronic charge separation, have inspired the development of much more complex multicomponent molecular devices. The use of the basic principles of photoinitiated electron transfer to engineer desirable properties into the more complex species is exemplified. The multiple electrontransfer pathways available with these molecules make it possible to fine-tune the systems in ways that are impossible with simpler molecules. The study of these devices not only contributes to our understanding of natural photosynthesis, but also aids in the design of artificial solar energy harvesting systems and provides an entry into the nascent field of molecular electronics."

Excess pore pressures were generated once horizontal acceleration exceeded a threshold value."

https://openalex.org/W2030545015,"A nearly complete skeleton of the archaic pinniped Enaliarctos, found in late Oligocene or early Miocene rocks (approximately 23 million years old) of California, provides new evidence on the origin of pinnipeds. Enaliarctos retains many primitive features expected in the hypothesized common ancestor of pinnipeds. Skeletal modifications seen in Enaliarctos document swimming adaptations and indicate that pinnipeds primitively used the axial skeleton and both fore and hindflippers as sources of propulsion. Elongate hindlimbs with prominent bony processes (reflecting powerful musculature) suggest that Enaliarctos was more active on land than modern pinnipeds."
https://openalex.org/W2121583153,"The distribution of the bismuth atoms over the cation sites in the 2212 Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O superconductor has been determined by anomalous scattering synchrotron crystallography. The analysis of reflection pairs measured at wavelengths of 0.9243 and 0.9600 angstrom shows a delocalization of the bismuth atoms over the calcium and strontium sites. The ""mixed"" plane between the CuO(2) layers contains 6.0(1.4) percent bismuth (where the number in brackets represents the statistical standard deviation derived from the least-squares refinement of the data), and a much smaller amount of strontium than often assumed. The strontium deficiency is charge-compensated by the creation of electron holes in the CuO(2) layer. The result supports the view that neither extra oxygen nor overlap of the bismuth 6p and copper 3d bands is needed to account for the holes, which are an essential feature of the superconductivity mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2032295853,"Lower Cretaceous cold-seep fossil assemblages have been found in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Serpulid worm tubes and bivalves are most abundant in these communities; in contrast, fossils are scarce in the surrounding strata. The fossils are contained in an isotopically light (delta(13)C = -25 to -50 per mil) carbonate rock groundmass that is interpreted to have formed from bacterial oxidation of methane. The rocks were deposited at intermediate depth (</=400 meters) in a cold marine environment; nearby normal faults may have provided a conduit for seeping methane and hydrogen sulfide needed to fuel chemosynthetic bacteria, and in turn, the higher life forms."
