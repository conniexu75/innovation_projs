https://openalex.org/W2747592475,"From medicines to materials, small organic molecules are indispensable for human well-being. To plan their syntheses, chemists employ a problem solving technique called retrosynthesis. In retrosynthesis, target molecules are recursively transformed into increasingly simpler precursor compounds until a set of readily available starting materials is obtained. Computer-aided retrosynthesis would be a highly valuable tool, however, past approaches were slow and provided results of unsatisfactory quality. Here, we employ Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to efficiently discover retrosynthetic routes. MCTS was combined with an expansion policy network that guides the search, and an ""in-scope"" filter network to pre-select the most promising retrosynthetic steps. These deep neural networks were trained on 12 million reactions, which represents essentially all reactions ever published in organic chemistry. Our system solves almost twice as many molecules and is 30 times faster in comparison to the traditional search method based on extracted rules and hand-coded heuristics. Finally after a 60 year history of computer-aided synthesis planning, chemists can no longer distinguish between routes generated by a computer system and real routes taken from the scientific literature. We anticipate that our method will accelerate drug and materials discovery by assisting chemists to plan better syntheses faster, and by enabling fully automated robot synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W4244519408,"Studies of galaxy surveys in the context of the cold dark matter paradigm have shown that the mass of the dark matter halo and the total stellar mass are coupled through a function that varies smoothly with mass. Their average ratio M_{halo}/M_{stars} has a minimum of about 30 for galaxies with stellar masses near that of the Milky Way (approximately 5x10^{10} solar masses) and increases both towards lower masses and towards higher masses. The scatter in this relation is not well known; it is generally thought to be less than a factor of two for massive galaxies but much larger for dwarf galaxies. Here we report the radial velocities of ten luminous globular-cluster-like objects in the ultra-diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2, which has a stellar mass of approximately 2x10^8 solar masses. We infer that its velocity dispersion is less than 10.5 kilometers per second with 90 per cent confidence, and we determine from this that its total mass within a radius of 7.6 kiloparsecs is less than 3.4x10^8 solar masses. This implies that the ratio M_{halo}/M_{stars} is of order unity (and consistent with zero), a factor of at least 400 lower than expected. NGC1052-DF2 demonstrates that dark matter is not always coupled with baryonic matter on galactic scales."

https://openalex.org/W2795241132,"Individuals with metabolic syndrome have increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We aimed to test the hypothesis that a high level of cardiorespiratory fitness (CR-fitness), counteracts accumulation of visceral fat, decreases inflammation and lowers risk factors of the metabolic syndrome.The study sample included 1,293 Danes (age 49-52 years) who from 2009 to 2011 participated in the Copenhagen Aging and Midlife Biobank, including a questionnaire, physical tests, and blood samples. Multiple linear regression models were performed with CR-fitness as exposure and plasma levels of cytokines and high sensitive C-reactive protein as outcomes and measures of abdominal obesity were added to test if they explained the potential association. Similarly, multiple linear regression models were performed with CR-fitness as exposure and factors of the metabolic syndrome as outcomes and the potential explanation by inflammatory biomarkers were tested. All models were adjusted for the effect of age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, socio-economic status, and acute inflammatory events within the preceding two weeks.CR-fitness was inversely associated with high sensitive C-reactive protein, Interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-18, and directly associated with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, but not associated with tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma or IL-1β. Abdominal obesity could partly explain the significant associations. Moreover, CR-fitness was inversely associated with an overall metabolic syndrome score, as well as triglycerides, glycated haemoglobin A1c, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and directly associated with high-density lipoprotein. Single inflammatory biomarkers and a combined inflammatory score partly explained these associations.Data suggest that CR-fitness has anti-inflammatory effects that are partly explained by a reduction in abdominal obesity and a decrease in the metabolic syndrome risk profile. The overall inflammatory load was mainly driven by high sensitive C-reactive protein and IL-6."
https://openalex.org/W2795307994,"In humans, six α(1,3)-fucosyltransferases (α(1,3)-FTs: FT3/FT4/FT5/FT6/FT7/FT9) reportedly fucosylate terminal lactosaminyl glycans yielding Lewis-X (LeX; CD15) and/or sialyl Lewis-X (sLeX; CD15s), structures that play key functions in cell migration, development, and immunity. Prior studies analyzing α(1,3)-FT specificities utilized either purified and/or recombinant enzymes to modify synthetic substrates under nonphysiological reaction conditions or molecular biology approaches wherein α(1,3)-FTs were expressed in mammalian cell lines, notably excluding investigations using primary human cells. Accordingly, although significant insights into α(1,3)-FT catalytic properties have been obtained, uncertainty persists regarding their human LeX/sLeX biosynthetic range across various glycoconjugates. Here, we undertook a comprehensive evaluation of the lactosaminyl product specificities of intracellularly expressed α(1,3)-FTs using a clinically relevant primary human cell type, mesenchymal stem cells. Cells were transfected with modified mRNA encoding each human α(1,3)-FT, and the resultant α(1,3)-fucosylated lactosaminyl glycoconjugates were analyzed using a combination of flow cytometry and MS. The data show that biosynthesis of sLeX is driven by FTs-3, -5, -6, and -7, with FT6 and FT7 having highest potency. FT4 and FT9 dominantly biosynthesize LeX, and, among all FTs, FT6 holds a unique capacity in creating sLeX and LeX determinants across protein and lipid glycoconjugates. Surprisingly, FT4 does not generate sLeX on glycolipids, and neither FT4, FT6, nor FT9 synthesizes the internally fucosylated sialyllactosamine VIM-2 (CD65s). These results unveil the relevant human lactosaminyl glycans created by human α(1,3)-FTs, providing novel insights on how these isoenzymes stereoselectively shape biosynthesis of vital glycoconjugates, thereby biochemically programming human cell migration and tuning human immunologic and developmental processes."
https://openalex.org/W2795343038,"Protein trafficking within cilia is mediated by the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery composed of large protein complexes. The BBSome consists of eight BBS proteins encoded by causative genes of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), and has been implicated in the trafficking of ciliary membrane proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), by connecting the IFT machinery to cargo GPCRs. Membrane recruitment of the BBSome to promote cargo trafficking has been proposed to be regulated by the Arf-like small GTPase ARL6/BBS3, through its interaction with the BBS1 subunit of the BBSome. We here investigated how the BBSome core subcomplex composed of BBS1, BBS2, BBS7, and BBS9 assembles and interacts with ARL6, and found that the ARL6-BBS1 interaction is reinforced by BBS9. BBS1-knockout (KO) cells showed defects in the ciliary entry of other BBSome subunits and ARL6, and in ciliary retrograde trafficking and the export of the GPCRs, Smoothened and GPR161. The trafficking defect of these GPCRs was rescued by the exogenous expression of wild-type BBS1, but not by its mutant lacking BBS9-binding ability. Our data thus indicate that the intact BBSome is required for retrograde trafficking of GPCRs out of cilia."
https://openalex.org/W2794929078,"The tendon is a mechanosensitive tissue, but little is known about how mechanical stimulation selectively signals tenogenic differentiation and neo-tendon formation. In this study, we compared the impact of uniaxial and biaxial mechanical loading on tendon-derived stem cells (TDSCs). Our data show that there are variations in cell signaling and cell differentiation of mouse TDSCs in response to uniaxial and biaxial loading in monolayer culture. Whereas uniaxial loading induced TDSCs toward tenogenic and osteogenic differentiation, biaxial loading induced osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation of TDSCs. Furthermore, by applying uniaxial loading on 3-dimensional (3D) TDSC constructs, tenogenic-specific differentiation and neo-tendon formation were observed, results that were replicated in human TDSCs. We also showed that uniaxial loading induced PKB (AKT) phosphorylation (pAKT), whereas biaxial loading induced pERK. Most importantly, we found that inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway could attenuate tenogenic differentiation and tendon formation in 3D TDSC constructs subjected to uniaxial loading. Taken together, our study highlights the importance of appropriate mechanobiological stimulation in 3D cell niches on tendon-like tissue formation and demonstrates that uniaxial mechanical loading plays an essential role in tenogenic differentiation and tendon formation by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.-Wang, T., Thien, C., Wang, C., Ni, M., Gao, J., Wang, A., Jiang, Q., Tuan, R.

https://openalex.org/W2795198395,"Aranbaltza is an archaeological complex formed by at least three open-air sites. Between 2014 and 2015 a test excavation carried out in Aranbaltza III revealed the presence of a sand and clay sedimentary sequence formed in floodplain environments, within which six sedimentary units have been identified. This sequence was formed between 137–50 ka, and includes several archaeological horizons, attesting to the long-term presence of Neanderthal communities in this area. One of these horizons, corresponding with Unit 4, yielded two wooden tools. One of these tools is a beveled pointed tool that was shaped through a complex operational sequence involving branch shaping, bark peeling, twig removal, shaping, polishing, thermal exposition and chopping. A use-wear analysis of the tool shows it to have traces related with digging soil so it has been interpreted as representing a digging stick. This is the first time such a tool has been identified in a European Late Middle Palaeolithic context; it also represents one of the first well-preserved Middle Palaeolithic wooden tool found in southern Europe. This artefact represents one of the few examples available of wooden tool preservation for the European Palaeolithic, allowing us to further explore the role wooden technologies played in Neanderthal communities."
https://openalex.org/W2795222330,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease with gastrointestinal dysfunction as well as comorbidities such as inflammation-induced bone loss and impaired immune response. Current treatments for IBD all have negative, potentially severe side effects. We aimed to test whether exogenous treatment with irisin, a novel immunomodulatory adipomyokine, could ameliorate IBD-induced lymphatic and bone alterations. Irisin treatment improved both gut and bone outcomes by mitigating inflammation and restoring structure. In the gut, IBD caused colonic lymphatic hyperproliferation into the mucosal and submucosal compartments. This proliferation in the rodent model is akin to what is observed in IBD patient case studies. In bone, IBD increased osteoclast surface and decreased bone formation. Both gut and osteocytes in bone exhibited elevated levels of TNF-a and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) protein expression. Exogenous irisin treatment restored normal colonic lymphatic architecture and increased bone formation rate concurrent with decreased osteoclast surfaces. After irisin treatment, gut and osteocyte TNF-α and RANKL protein expression levels were no different from vehicle controls. Our data indicate that the systemic immunologic changes that occur in IBD are initiated by damage in the gut and likely linked through the lymphatic system. Additionally, irisin is a potential novel intervention mitigating both local inflammatory changes in the gut and distant changes in bone.—Narayanan, S. A., Metzger, C. E., Bloomfield, S. A., Zawieja, D. C. Inflammation-induced lymphatic architecture and bone turnover changes are ameliorated by irisin treatment in chronic inflammatory bowel disease.

https://openalex.org/W2794589613,"Pinaceae, the largest family of conifers, has a diversified organization of chloroplast (cp) genomes with two typical highly reduced inverted repeats (IRs). In the current study, we determined the complete sequence of the cp genome of an economically and ecologically important conifer tree, the loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.), using Illumina paired-end sequencing and compared the sequence with those of other pine species. The results revealed a genome size of 121,531 base pairs (bp) containing a pair of 830-bp IR regions, distinguished by a small single copy (42,258 bp) and large single copy (77,614 bp) region. The chloroplast genome of P. taeda encodes 120 genes, comprising 81 protein-coding genes, four ribosomal RNA genes, and 35 tRNA genes, with 151 randomly distributed microsatellites. Approximately 6 palindromic, 34 forward, and 22 tandem repeats were found in the P. taeda cp genome. Whole cp genome comparison with those of other Pinus species exhibited an overall high degree of sequence similarity, with some divergence in intergenic spacers. Higher and lower numbers of indels and single-nucleotide polymorphism substitutions were observed relative to P. contorta and P. monophylla, respectively. Phylogenomic analyses based on the complete genome sequence revealed that 60 shared genes generated trees with the same topologies, and P. taeda was closely related to P. contorta in the subgenus Pinus. Thus, the complete P. taeda genome provided valuable resources for population and evolutionary studies of gymnosperms and can be used to identify related species."
https://openalex.org/W2795052379,"Background Risk prediction is crucial in many areas of medical practice, such as cardiac transplantation, but existing clinical risk-scoring methods have suboptimal performance. We develop a novel risk prediction algorithm and test its performance on the database of all patients who were registered for cardiac transplantation in the United States during 1985-2015. Methods and findings We develop a new, interpretable, methodology (ToPs: Trees of Predictors) built on the principle that specific predictive (survival) models should be used for specific clusters within the patient population. ToPs discovers these specific clusters and the specific predictive model that performs best for each cluster. In comparison with existing clinical risk scoring methods and state-of-the-art machine learning methods, our method provides significant improvements in survival predictions, both post- and pre-cardiac transplantation. For instance: in terms of 3-month survival post-transplantation, our method achieves AUC of 0.660; the best clinical risk scoring method (RSS) achieves 0.587. In terms of 3-year survival/mortality predictions post-transplantation (in comparison to RSS), holding specificity at 80.0%, our algorithm correctly predicts survival for 2,442 (14.0%) more patients (of 17,441 who actually survived); holding sensitivity at 80.0%, our algorithm correctly predicts mortality for 694 (13.0%) more patients (of 5,339 who did not survive). ToPs achieves similar improvements for other time horizons and for predictions pre-transplantation. ToPs discovers the most relevant features (covariates), uses available features to best advantage, and can adapt to changes in clinical practice. Conclusions We show that, in comparison with existing clinical risk-scoring methods and other machine learning methods, ToPs significantly improves survival predictions both post- and pre-cardiac transplantation. ToPs provides a more accurate, personalized approach to survival prediction that can benefit patients, clinicians, and policymakers in making clinical decisions and setting clinical policy. Because survival prediction is widely used in clinical decision-making across diseases and clinical specialties, the implications of our methods are far-reaching."
https://openalex.org/W2794673766,"The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) plays a central role in cardiovascular disease (CVD) by degrading hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). As such, loss-of-function (LOF) PCSK9 variants that fail to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) increase hepatic LDLR levels and lower the risk of developing CVD. The retention of misfolded protein in the ER can cause ER stress and activate the unfolded protein response (UPR). In this study, we investigated whether a variety of LOF PCSK9 variants that are retained in the ER can cause ER stress and hepatic cytotoxicity. Although overexpression of these PCSK9 variants caused an accumulation in the ER of hepatocytes, UPR activation or apoptosis was not observed. Furthermore, ER retention of endogenous PCSK9 via splice switching also failed to induce the UPR. Consistent with these in vitro studies, overexpression of PCSK9 in the livers of mice had no impact on UPR activation. To elucidate the cellular mechanism to explain these surprising findings, we observed that the 94-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP94) sequesters PCSK9 away from the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), the major activator of the UPR. As a result, GRP94 knockdown increased the stability of GRP78–PCSK9 complex and resulted in UPR activation following overexpression of ER-retained PCSK9 variants relative to WT secreted controls. Given that overexpression of these LOF PCSK9 variants does not cause UPR activation under normal homeostatic conditions, therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking the autocatalytic cleavage of PCSK9 in the ER represent a viable strategy for reducing circulating PCSK9.

However, it remains unclear whether socioeconomic disparity in caregiver burdens exists under a public, universal long-term care insurance (LTCI) system. This study examined income-based inequalities in caregiving time and depressive symptoms in Japanese older family caregivers. We further compared inequality in depressive symptoms with that of non-caregivers to evaluate whether family caregiving exacerbates this disparity.Data were obtained from a cross-sectional, nationwide survey conducted by the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study in 2013. Participants were functionally independent older adults aged ≥65 years (N = 21,584). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Geriatrics Depression Scale (GDS); caregiving hours per week, household income, and other covariates were also assessed.Family caregivers occupied 8.3% of the total. A Poisson regression model revealed that caregivers in lower income groups (compared to those in the highest) were 1.32 to 1.95 and 1.63 to 2.68 times more likely to engage in ≥36 and ≥72 hours/week of caregiving, respectively. As for the GDS (≥5), an excess risk was found in the caregivers in lower (compared to higher) income groups (adjusted prevalence ratio: 1.57-3.10). However, an interaction effect of income by caregiving role indicated no significant difference in inequality between caregivers and non-caregivers (p = .603). The excess risk for GDS (≥5) in the caregivers compared to non-caregivers was observed across income groups.Our findings revealed a possible disparity in family caregivers under the public LTCI system. Further studies should examine factors associated with longer caregiving hours in lower income households. Our findings also suggest the necessity for more efforts to alleviate depressive symptoms in family caregivers under the LTCI system regardless of income level, rather than exclusively supporting those with a low income."
https://openalex.org/W2794709531,"Increasing use of factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors necessitates effective reversal agents to manage bleeding. Andexanet alfa, a novel modified recombinant human FXa, rapidly reverses the anticoagulation effects of direct and indirect FXa inhibitors.To evaluate the ability of andexanet to reverse anticoagulation in vitro and reduce bleeding in rabbits administered edoxaban.In vitro studies characterized the interaction of andexanet with edoxaban and its ability to reverse edoxaban-mediated anti-FXa activity. In a rabbit model of surgically induced, acute hemorrhage, animals received edoxaban vehicle+andexanet vehicle (control), edoxaban (1 mg/kg)+andexanet vehicle, edoxaban+andexanet (75 mg, 5-minute infusion, 20 minutes after edoxaban), or edoxaban vehicle+andexanet prior to injury.Andexanet bound edoxaban with high affinity similar to FXa. Andexanet rapidly and dose-dependently reversed the effects of edoxaban on FXa activity and coagulation pharmacodynamic parameters in vitro. In edoxaban-anticoagulated rabbits, andexanet reduced anti-FXa activity by 82% (from 548±87 to 100±41 ng/ml; P<0.0001), mean unbound edoxaban plasma concentration by ~80% (from 100±10 to 21±6 ng/ml; P<0.0001), and blood loss by 80% vs. vehicle (adjusted for control, 2.6 vs. 12.9 g; P = 0.003). The reduction in blood loss correlated with the decrease in anti-FXa activity (r = 0.6993, P<0.0001) and unbound edoxaban (r = 0.5951, P = 0.0035).These data demonstrate that andexanet rapidly reversed the anticoagulant effects of edoxaban, suggesting it could be clinically valuable for the management of acute and surgery-related bleeding. Correlation of blood loss with anti-FXa activity supports the use of anti-FXa activity as a biomarker for assessing anticoagulation reversal in clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2794737948,"The fornicata (fornicates) is a eukaryotic group known to consist of free-living and parasitic organisms. Genome datasets of two model fornicate parasites Giardia intestinalis and Spironucleus salmonicida are well annotated, so far. The nuclear genomes of G. intestinalis assemblages and S. salmonicida are small in terms of the genome size and simple in genome structure. However, an ancestral genomic structure and gene contents, from which genomes of the fornicate parasites have evolved, remains to be clarified. In order to understand genome evolution in fornicates, here, we present the draft genome sequence of a free-living fornicate, Kipferlia bialata, the divergence of which is earlier than those of the fornicate parasites, and compare it to the genomes of G. intestinalis and S. salmonicida. Our data show that the number of protein genes and introns in K. bialata genome are the most abundant in the genomes of three fornicates, reflecting an ancestral state of fornicate genome evolution. Evasion mechanisms of host immunity found in G. intestinalis and S. salmonicida are absent in the K. bialata genome, suggesting that the two parasites acquired the complex membrane surface proteins on the line leading to the common ancestor of G. intestinalis and S. salmonicida after the divergence from K. bialata. Furthermore, the mitochondrion related organelles (MROs) of K. bialata possess more complex suites of metabolic pathways than those in Giardia and in Spironucleus. In sum, our results unveil the process of reductive evolution which shaped the current genomes in two model fornicate parasites G. intestinalis and S. salmonicida."

Protease activity is tightly regulated via control of gene expression, enzyme and substrate compartmentalization, zymogen activation, enzyme inactivation, and substrate availability. Emerging evidence suggests that proteolysis can also be regulated by substrate glycosylation and that glycosylation of individual sites on a substrate can decrease or, in rare cases, increase its sensitivity to proteolysis. Here, we investigated the relationship between site-specific, mucin-type (or GalNAc-type) O-glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage of extracellular proteins. Using in silico analysis, we found that O-glycosylation and cleavage sites are significantly associated with each other. We then used a positional proteomic strategy, terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS), to map the in vivo cleavage sites in HepG2 SimpleCells with and without one of the key initiating GalNAc transferases, GalNAc-T2, and after treatment with exogenous matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) or neutrophil elastase. Surprisingly, we found that loss of GalNAc-T2 not only increased cleavage, but also decreased cleavage across a broad range of other substrates, including key regulators of the protease network. We also found altered processing of several central regulators of lipid homeostasis, including apolipoprotein B and the phospholipid transfer protein, providing new clues to the previously reported link between GALNT2 and lipid homeostasis.

However, defining physiologically relevant protein substrates and cleavage sites for each protease is nontrivial. Protease substrates can be identified in vitro using biochemical assays and high-throughput screens, whereas yeast two-hybrid methods or immobilized inactive protease domains can be used to probe more complex exosite-driven interactions (5Overall C.M. Blobel C.P. In search of partners: linking extracellular proteases to substrates.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Using these methods, homologous proteases often display broad and overlapping specificities, which are not necessarily recapitulated in vivo. This disparity arises because, in the cellular setting, protease activity is tightly regulated by control of gene expression; compartmentalization and sequestering of enzyme activity; zymogen activation and enzyme inactivation; substrate availability and specificity; and post-translational modification (PTM) 4The abbreviations used are:PTMpost-translational modificationADAMA disintegrin and metalloproteinaseMMPmatrix metalloproteinaseGalNAc-TGalNAc transferaseTAILSterminal amine isotopic labeling of substratesSCSimpleCellsFDRfalse discovery rateTIMPtissue inhibitor of metalloproteinasesAMPNaminopeptidase NGOgene ontologyKOknockoutHPG-ALDIIhyperbranched polyglycerol polyaldehyde-derivatized polymer. of the enzyme or substrate.

Similarly, dense mucin-type or O-N-acetylgalactosamine (O-GalNAc) O-glycosylation (herein referred to as O-glycosylation) has long been proposed to nonspecifically shield proteins from degradation in the extracellular space (19Kozarsky K.

However, it is increasingly apparent that individual O-glycosites present on substrates can also exert fine control over protease specificity. The first example of this was the inhibition of proprotein processing of pro-opiomelanocortin by O-glycosylation at Thr-45 (20Mains R.E.

More recently, increased proprotein processing resulting from loss of O-glycosylation has been associated with familial tumoral calcinosis (23Kato K. Jeanneau C. Tarp M.A. Benet-Pagès A.

Such cross-talk between O-glycosylation and proprotein convertases may be a general phenomenon, as peptide assays indicate that O-glycans can inhibit cleavage by furin on multiple substrates (26Schjoldager K.T. Vester-Christensen M.B. Goth C.K. Petersen T.N. Brunak S. Bennett E.P. Levery S.B. Clausen H.

Furthermore, regulation of proteolysis by O-glycosylation is not limited to an individual protease family, as shedding by members of the A disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) subfamily is also inhibited by site-specific O-glycosylation (27Goth C.K.

Indeed, O-glycosylation of a growing number of substrates has been shown to alter their sensitivity to proteases of the aspartic (β-secretase), serine (furin, chymotrypsin), or metallo (ADAMs and metalloproteinases (MMPs)) families, suggesting that cross-talk between these PTMs may occur independently of the mechanism of catalysis (29Schjoldager K.T.

However, this does not indicate that O-glycosylation is an indiscriminate inhibitor of proteolysis. Indeed, glycosylation of specific Ser or Thr residues may generate disparate responses ranging from complete inhibition to activation even within the same protease family, as has been demonstrated in the case of ADAM proteases (28Goth C.K. Halim A. Khetarpal S.A. Rader D.J. Clausen H. Schjoldager K.T. A systematic study of modulation of ADAM-mediated ectodomain shedding by site-specific O-glycosylation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Moreover, in vitro peptide assays and cell-based reporter constructs support a model in which the O-glycan is located within or close to the binding cleft, and, at least in the case of furin, the closer the glycan is to the scissile bond, the greater its inhibitory effect (26Schjoldager K.T.

Given that recent developments in MS, within our laboratory and others, have shown that over 85% of proteins transiting through the secretory pathway are likely to be O-glycosylated (30Steentoft C. Vakhrushev S.Y. Joshi H.J. Kong Y. Vester-Christensen M.B. Schjoldager K.T. Lavrsen K. Dabelsteen S. Pedersen N.B. Marcos-Silva L. Gupta R. Bennett E.P. Mandel U. Brunak S.

In the present study, we investigated the relationship between site-specific O-glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage of extracellular proteins. O-Glycosylation is unique, as it is initiated by a family of 20 N-acetylgalactosamine transferases (GalNAc-Ts), each of which displays a partly overlapping but distinct substrate specificity (31Wandall H.H.

Although GalNAc-T enzymes have not been shown to respond dynamically to changes in the cellular environment to date, they display markedly different expression profiles between cell types and during differentiation (34Tian E.

Given the emerging evidence that glycosylation can alter substrate sensitivity to proteolysis, we hypothesized that alternate site-specific glycosylation could be used to globally fine-tune protein sensitivity to proteolysis in a protease- and cell-specific manner. To investigate whether there was evidence for this hypothesis, we first performed a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of known O-glycosylation sites with known proteolytic cleavage sites in the entire human proteome and found a significant association between O-glycosylation sites and cleavage sites. We next asked whether lack of a subset of O-glycosylation sites would alter the global proteolytic cleavage pattern, and if so, whether we could identify certain classes of proteolytic cleavage sites that were particularly affected. To address this question, we used a robust positional proteomic strategy, terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS) (40Kleifeld O. Doucet A. Prudova A. auf dem Keller U. Gioia M.

GalNAc-T2 has been shown to be a major driver of O-glycosylation (42Schjoldager K.T. Joshi H.J. Kong Y. Goth C.K. King S.L. Wandall H.H. Bennett E.P. Vakhrushev S.Y. Clausen H. Deconstruction of O-glycosylation–GalNAc-T isoforms direct distinct subsets of the O-glycoproteome.EMBO Rep. 2015; 16 (26566661): 1713-172210.15252/embr.201540796Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and several examples of interplay between GalNAc-T2–specific O-glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage have been described (27Goth C.K.

With this strategy, we identified 189 proteolytic cleavage sites altered by the lack of a subset of O-glycosylation sites. We identified substrates where loss of O-glycans caused increased cleavage, indicating an expected shielding of the cleavage site, and, most unexpectedly, we also identified a second subset of substrates where loss of O-glycans caused decreased cleavage. Overall, our studies reveal that O-glycosylation can both decrease and also increase substrate cleavage. Despite evidence of cross-talk between GalNAc-type O-glycosylation and mainly proprotein convertases and ADAM metalloproteases, it is unknown which other proteases are subject to regulation by site specific O-glycosylation. Moreover, it is not clear to what degree site-specific O-glycosylation contributes to the overall substrate degradome of a particular protease. To address these questions, we first identified candidate proteases that targeted O-glycoproteins. We performed an unbiased in-silico screen using the TopFIND knowledgebase (44Fortelny N. Yang S. Pavlidis P. Lange P.F. Overall C.M. Proteome TopFIND 3.0 with TopFINDer and PathFINDer: database and analysis tools for the association of protein termini to pre- and post-translational events.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 (25332401): D290-D29710.1093/nar/gku1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the protein termini and cleavage site knowledge base, and selected proteases with well-defined degradomes (>40 cleavages in >20 proteins). We found that all proteases cleaved O-glycoproteins. However, the proportion of O-glycoprotein substrates varied from 2 to 69% (Fig. 1A). MMPs, neutrophil elastase, thrombin, plasmin, kallikrein, and proprotein convertases were among the proteases that targeted O-glycoproteins most frequently, with O-glycoproteins constituting >35% of their substrates. Having identified a set of well-characterized proteases that were demonstrated to cleave O-glycoproteins, we next determined whether O-glycosylation occurred in the vicinity of the cleavage site. We found that on O-glycoprotein substrates, more than 25% of MMP (MMP3, -7, -9, and -14), neutrophil elastase, thrombin, and plasmin cleavage sites were flanked by O-glycans within 10 residues up- or downstream of the scissile bond. In many cases, flanking regions carried multiple O-glycosites (Fig. 1B). There was little evidence for prime or nonprime (N- or C-terminal) bias in O-glycosylation, and if multiple O-glycans were present, they were frequently located on both sides of the scissile bond. Given the abundance of O-glycosylation around this subset of cleavage sites, we next asked whether O-glycans were under- or overrepresented at specific positions. To achieve this, we conceptualized O-glycosylated amino acids as a unique amino acid, X, and assessed the frequency with which they occurred using heat maps (Fig. 1C). Analysis was performed both with and without correction for protein disorder, as O-glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage occur more often in disordered loops (30Steentoft C. Vakhrushev S.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2795090341,"The Tiber valley is a prominent feature in the landscape of ancient Rome and an important element for understanding its urban development. However, little is known about the city’s original setting. Our research provides new data on the Holocene sedimentary history and human-environment interactions in the Forum Boarium, the location of the earliest harbor of the city. Since the Last Glacial Maximum, when the fluvial valley was incised to a depth of tens of meters below the present sea level, 14C and ceramic ages coupled with paleomagnetic analysis show the occurrence of three distinct aggradational phases until the establishment of a relatively stable alluvial plain at 6–8 m a.s.l. during the late 3rd century BCE. Moreover, we report evidence of a sudden and anomalous increase in sedimentation rate around 2600 yr BP, leading to the deposition of a 4-6m thick package of alluvial deposits in approximately one century. We discuss this datum in the light of possible tectonic activity along a morpho-structural lineament, revealed by the digital elevation model of this area, crossing the Forum Boarium and aligned with the Tiber Island. We formulate the hypothesis that fault displacement along this structural lineament may be responsible for the sudden collapse of the investigated area, which provided new space for the observed unusually large accumulation of sediments. We also posit that, as a consequence of the diversion of the Tiber course and the loss in capacity of transport by the river, this faulting activity triggered the origin of the Tiber Island."
https://openalex.org/W2794592225,"Prolactin (PRL), whose principal role is regulation of lactation, is mainly synthesized and secreted by lactotroph anterior pituitary cells. Its signaling is exerted via a transmembrane PRL receptor (PRLR) expressed in a wide variety of tissues, including the anterior pituitary. Dopamine, which is secreted by tuberoinfundibular hypothalamic neurons, is the major inhibitory regulator of prolactin secretion. Although PRL is well established to stimulate hypothalamic dopamine secretion, thereby exerting a negative feedback regulation on its own release, autocrine or paracrine actions of PRL on lactotroph cells have also been suggested. Within the pituitary, PRL may inhibit both lactotroph proliferation and secretion, but in vivo evaluation of these putative functions is limited. To determine whether the autocrine actions of prolactin have a significant role in the physiologic function of lactotrophs in vivo, we examined the consequences of conditional deletion of Prlr in lactotroph cells using a novel mouse line with loxP sites flanking the Prlr gene (Prlrloxl/lox) and Cre-recombinase (Cre) expressed under the control of the pituitary-specific Prl promoter. Prlrlox/lox/Prl-Cre mice have normal PRL levels and did not develop any pituitary lactotroph adenoma, even at 20 mo of age. Nevertheless, Prlrloxl/loxlPrl-Cre mice displayed an increased dopaminergic inhibitory tone compared with control Prlrlox/lox mice. These results elegantly confirm an autocrine/paracrine feedback of PRL on lactotroph cells in vivo, which can be fully compensated by an intact hypothalamic feedback system.—Bernard, V., Lamothe, S., Beau, I., Guillou, A., Martin, A., Le Tissier, P., Grattan, D., Young, J., Binart, N.

https://openalex.org/W2794543459,"Crystal structures of two bacterial metal (Zn2+)-dependent d-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) aldolases in complex with substrate, analogues, and triose-P reaction products were determined to 1.5-2.0 Å resolution. The ligand complexes cryotrapped in native or mutant Helicobacter pylori aldolase crystals enabled a novel mechanistic description of FBP C3-C4 bond cleavage. The reaction mechanism uses active site remodeling during the catalytic cycle, implicating relocation of the Zn2+ cofactor that is mediated by conformational changes of active site loops. Substrate binding initiates conformational changes triggered upon P1 phosphate binding, which liberates the Zn2+-chelating His-180, allowing it to act as a general base for the proton abstraction at the FBP C4 hydroxyl group. A second zinc-chelating His-83 hydrogen bonds the substrate C4 hydroxyl group and assists cleavage by stabilizing the developing negative charge during proton abstraction. Cleavage is concerted with relocation of the metal cofactor from an interior to a surface-exposed site, thereby stabilizing the nascent enediolate form. Conserved residue Glu-142 is essential for protonation of the enediolate form prior to product release. A d-tagatose 1,6-bisphosphate enzymatic complex reveals how His-180-mediated proton abstraction controls stereospecificity of the cleavage reaction. Recognition and discrimination of the reaction products, dihydroxyacetone-P and d-glyceraldehyde 3-P, occurs via charged hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl groups of the triose-Ps and conserved residues, Asp-82 and Asp-255, respectively, and are crucial aspects of the enzyme's role in gluconeogenesis. Conformational changes in mobile loops β5-α7 and β6-α8 (containing catalytic residues Glu-142 and His-180, respectively) drive active site remodeling, enabling the relocation of the metal cofactor."
https://openalex.org/W2794716314,"Additive manufacturing has been a cornerstone of the product development pipeline for decades, playing an essential role in the creation of both functional and cosmetic prototypes. In recent years, the prospects for distributed and open source manufacturing have grown tremendously. This growth has been enabled by an expanding library of printable materials, low-cost printers, and communities dedicated to platform development. The microfluidics community has embraced this opportunity to integrate 3D printing into the suite of manufacturing strategies used to create novel fluidic architectures. The rapid turnaround time and low cost to implement these strategies in the lab makes 3D printing an attractive alternative to conventional micro- and nanofabrication techniques. In this work, the production of multiple microfluidic architectures using a hybrid 3D printing-soft lithography approach is demonstrated and shown to enable rapid device fabrication with channel dimensions that take advantage of laminar flow characteristics. The fabrication process outlined here is underpinned by the implementation of custom design software with an integrated slicer program that replaces less intuitive computer aided design and slicer software tools. Devices are designed in the program by assembling parameterized microfluidic building blocks. The fabrication process and flow control within 3D printed devices were demonstrated with a gradient generator and two droplet generator designs. Precise control over the printing process allowed 3D microfluidics to be printed in a single step by extruding bridge structures to ‘jump-over’ channels in the same plane. This strategy was shown to integrate with conventional nanofabrication strategies to simplify the operation of a platform that incorporates both nanoscale features and 3D printed microfluidics."
https://openalex.org/W2794696477,"Tensile strength and fracture toughness, important parameters of the rock for engineering applications are difficult to measure. Thus this paper selected three kinds of granite samples (grain sizes = 1.01mm, 2.12mm and 3mm), used the combined experiments of physical and numerical simulation (RFPA-DIP version) to conduct three-point-bending (3-p-b) tests with different notches and introduced the acoustic emission monitor system to analyze the fracture mechanism around the notch tips. To study the effects of grain size on the tensile strength and toughness of rock samples, a modified fracture model was established linking fictitious crack to the grain size so that the microstructure of the specimens and fictitious crack growth can be considered together. The fractal method was introduced to represent microstructure of three kinds of granites and used to determine the length of fictitious crack. It is a simple and novel method to calculate the tensile strength and fracture toughness directly. Finally, the theoretical model was verified by the comparison to the numerical experiments by calculating the nominal strength σn and maximum loads Pmax."
https://openalex.org/W2793530112,"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an approved therapy for treatment of epilepsy and depression. While also shown to be promising in several preclinical and clinical studies to treat cardiovascular diseases, optimal therapeutic stimulation paradigms are still under investigation. Traditionally, parameters such as frequency, current, and duty cycle are used to adjust the efficacy of VNS therapy. This study explored the effect of novel stochastic VNS (S-VNS) on acute heart rate (HR) dynamics. The effect of S-VNS was evaluated in Sprague Dawley rats by comparing the acute HR and HR variability (HRV) responses to standard, periodic VNS (P-VNS) across different frequencies (FREQs, 10–30 Hz). Our results demonstrate that both S-VNS and P-VNS produced negative chronotropic effects in a FREQ-dependent manner with S-VNS inducing a significantly smaller drop in HR at 10 Hz and 20 Hz compared to P-VNS (p<0.05). S-VNS demonstrated a FREQ-dependent drop in the SD1/SD2 ratio, a measure of HRV, which was absent in P-VNS, suggesting that S-VNS may acutely modulate the nonlinear relationship between short- and long-term HRV. In conclusion, S-VNS is a novel stimulation procedure that may provide different physiological outcomes from standard P-VNS, as indicated by our analysis of HR dynamics. Our study provides a rationale for further detailed investigations into the therapeutic potential of S-VNS as a novel neuromodulation technique."
https://openalex.org/W2795222548,"Methionine residues in proteins provide antioxidant defense by reacting with oxidizing species, which oxidize methionine to methionine sulfoxide. Reduction of the sulfoxide back to methionine is catalyzed by methionine sulfoxide reductases, essential for protection against oxidative stress. The nonmyristoylated form of methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MSRA) is present in mitochondria, whereas the myristoylated form has been previously reported to be cytosolic. Despite the importance of MSRA in antioxidant defense, its in vivo binding partners and substrates have not been identified. Starting with a protein array, and followed by immunoprecipitation experiments, colocalization studies, and subcellular fractionation, we identified the late endosomal protein, StAR-related lipid transfer domain–containing 3 (STARD3), as a binding partner of myristoylated MSRA, but not of nonmyristoylated MSRA. STARD3 is known to have both membrane-binding and cytosolic domains that are important in STARD3-mediated transport of cholesterol from the endoplasmic reticulum to the endosome. We found that the STARD3 cytosolic domain localizes MSRA to the late endosome. We propose that the previous conclusion that myristoylated MSRA is strictly a cytosolic protein is artifactual and likely due to vigorous overexpression of MSRA. We conclude that myristoylated MSRA is a late endosomal protein that may play a role in lipid metabolism or may protect endosomal proteins from oxidative damage.

https://openalex.org/W2795297029,"Polyploidization has played an important role in the evolution of vertebrates, particularly at the base of Teleostei-an enormously successful ray-finned fish group with additional genome doublings on lower taxonomic levels. The investigation of post-polyploid genome dynamics might provide important clues about the evolution and ecology of respective species and can help to decipher the role of polyploidy per se on speciation. Few studies have attempted to investigate the dynamics of repetitive DNA sequences in the post-polyploid genome using molecular cytogenetic tools in fishes, though recent efforts demonstrated their usefulness. The demonstrably monophyletic freshwater loach family Botiidae, branching to evolutionary diploid and tetraploid lineages separated >25 Mya, offers a suited model group for comparing the long-term repetitive DNA evolution. For this, we integrated phylogenetic analyses with cytogenetical survey involving Giemsa- and Chromomycin A3 (CMA3)/DAPI stainings and fluorescence in situ hybridization with 5S/45S rDNA, U2 snDNA and telomeric probes in representative sample of 12 botiid species. The karyotypes of all diploids were composed of 2n = 50 chromosomes, while majority of tetraploids had 2n = 4x = 100, with only subtle interspecific karyotype differences. The exceptional karyotype of Botia dario (2n = 4x = 96) suggested centric fusions behind the 2n reduction. Variable patterns of FISH signals revealed cases of intraspecific polymorphisms, rDNA amplification, variable degree of correspondence with CMA3+ sites and almost no phylogenetic signal. In tetraploids, either additivity or loci gain/loss was recorded. Despite absence of classical interstitial telomeric sites, large blocks of interspersed rDNA/telomeric regions were found in diploids only. We uncovered different molecular drives of studied repetitive DNA classes within botiid genomes as well as the advanced stage of the re-diploidization process in tetraploids. Our results may contribute to link genomic approach with molecular cytogenetic analyses in addressing the origin and mechanism of this polyploidization event."
https://openalex.org/W2794687139,"L-carnitine is important for the catabolism of long-chain fatty acids in the mitochondria. We investigated how the triacylglycerol (TAG)-lowering drug 2-(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic acid (1-triple TTA) influenced lipid metabolism in carnitine-depleted, 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazinium)propionate dehydrate (Mildronate; meldonium)-treated male Wistar rats. As indicated, carnitine biosynthesis was impaired by Mildronate. However, TAG levels of both plasma and liver were decreased by 1-triple TTA in Mildronate-treated animals. This was accompanied by increased gene expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial activity and proliferation and reduced mRNA levels of Dgat2, ApoB and ApoCIII in liver. The hepatic energy state was reduced in the group of Mildronate and 1-triple TTA as reflected by increased AMP/ATP ratio, reduced energy charge and induced gene expression of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3. The increase in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation was observed despite low plasma carnitine levels, and was linked to strongly induced gene expression of carnitine acetyltransferase, translocase and carnitine transporter, suggesting an efficient carnitine turnover. The present data suggest that the plasma TAG-lowering effect of 1-triple TTA in Mildronate-treated rats is not only due to increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation reflected by increased mitochondrial biogenesis, but also to changes in plasma clearance and reduced TAG biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2795103092,"Chemistry researchers are frequently evaluated on the perceived significance of their work with the citation count as the most commonly-used metric for gauging this property. Recent studies have called for a broader evaluation of significance that includes more nuanced bibliometrics as well as altmetrics to more completely evaluate scientific research. To better understand the relationship between metrics and peer judgements of significance in chemistry, we have conducted a survey of chemists to investigate their perceptions of previously published research. Focusing on a specific issue of the Journal of the American Chemical Society published in 2003, respondents were asked to select which articles they thought best matched importance and significance given several contexts: highest number of citations, most significant (subjectively defined), most likely to share among chemists, and most likely to share with a broader audience. The answers to the survey can be summed up in several observations. The ability of respondents to predict the citation counts of established research is markedly lower than the ability of those counts to be predicted by the h-index of the corresponding author of each article. This observation is conserved even when only considering responses from chemists whose expertise falls within the subdiscipline that best describes the work performed in an article. Respondents view both cited papers and significant papers differently than papers that should be shared with chemists. We conclude from our results that peer judgements of importance and significance differ from metrics-based measurements, and that chemists should work with bibliometricians to develop metrics that better capture the nuance of opinions on the importance of a given piece of research."
https://openalex.org/W2794555555,"The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway transports folded proteins across bacterial membranes. Tat precursor proteins possess a conserved twin-arginine (RR) motif in their signal peptides that is involved in the binding of the proteins to the membrane-associated TatBC receptor complex. In addition, the hydrophobic region in the Tat signal peptides also contributes to TatBC binding, but whether regions beyond the signal-peptide cleavage site are involved in this process is unknown. Here, we analyzed the contribution of the early mature protein part of the Escherichia coli trimethylamine N-oxide reductase (TorA) to productive TatBC receptor binding. We identified substitutions in the 30 amino acids immediately following the TorA signal peptide (30aa-region) that restored export of a transport-defective TorA[KQ]-30aa-MalE precursor, in which the RR residues had been replaced by a lysine-glutamine pair. Some of these substitutions increased the hydrophobicity of the N-terminal part of the 30aa-region and thereby likely enhanced hydrophobic substrate-receptor interactions within the hydrophobic TatBC substrate-binding cavity. Another class of substitutions increased the positive net charge of the region's C-terminal part, presumably leading to strengthened electrostatic interactions between the mature substrate part and the cytoplasmic TatBC regions. Furthermore, we identified substitutions in the C-terminal domains of TatB following the transmembrane segment that restored transport of various transport-defective TorA-MalE derivatives. Some of these substitutions most likely affected the orientation or conformation of the flexible, carboxy-proximal helices of TatB. Therefore, we propose that a tight accommodation of the folded mature region by TatB contributes to productive binding of Tat substrates to TatBC."
https://openalex.org/W2794888368,"The languages developed by deaf communities are unique for using visual signs produced by the hand. In the present study, we explored the cognitive effects of employing the hand as articulator. We focused on the arbitrariness of the form-meaning relationship-a fundamental feature of natural languages-and asked whether sign languages change the processing of arbitrary non-linguistic stimulus-response (S-R) associations involving the hand. This was tested using the Simon effect, which specifically requires such type of associations. Differences between signers and speakers (non-signers) only appeared in the Simon task when hand stimuli were shown. Response-time analyses revealed that the distinctiveness of signers' responses derived from an increased ability to process memory traces of arbitrary S-R pairs related to the hand. These results shed light on the interplay between language and cognition as well as on the effects of sign language acquisition."
https://openalex.org/W2795211122,"Background The management of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) with rate-lowering or anti-arrhythmic drugs has markedly changed over the last decade, but it is unknown how these changes have affected patients with NVAF with a permanent pacemaker (PPM). Methods Through Danish nationwide registries, patients with NVAF and a PPM were identified from 2001 to 2012. Changes in concomitant pharmacotherapy and comorbidities were tested using the Cochran–Armitage trend test and linear regression. Patients with NVAF were identified to calculate the proportional amount of PPM implants. Results A total of 12,231 NVAF patients with a PPM were included in the study, 55.6% of which were men. Median age was 78 years (interquartile range 70–84). From 2001 to 2012, the number of NVAF patients with a PPM increased from 850 to 1344, while the number of NVAF patients increased from 67,478 to 127,261. Thus, the proportional amount of NVAF patients with a PPM decreased from 1.3% to 1.1% (p = 0.015). Overall 45.9% had atrial fibrillation (AF) duration less than one year and the proportion declined from 55.5% to 42.4% (p <0.001). Diabetes mellitus increased from 7.2% to 16.8% (p <0.001). Heart failure (HF) decreased from 36.7% to 29.3% (p = 0.010) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) decreased from 32.4% to 26.1% (p <0.001). Beta-blocker use increased from 38.1% to 58.0% (p <0.001), while digoxin and anti-arrhythmic drug use decreased over time. Conclusion From 2001 to 2012, the absolute number of NVAF patients with a PPM increased while the proportional amount decreased. The number of NVAF patients receiving a PPM within one year of AF diagnosis decreased. The prevalence of DM increased, while the prevalence of HF and IHD was high but decreasing. The use of beta-blockers increased markedly, while use of digoxin and anti-arrhythmic drugs decreased over time."

https://openalex.org/W2794750698,"Understanding the regulation of insulin biosynthesis is important as it plays a central role in glucose metabolism. The mouse insulin gene2 (Ins2) has two splice variants; long (Ins2L) and short (Ins2S), that differ only in their 5'UTR sequence and Ins2S is the major transcript which translate more efficiently as compared to Ins2L. Here, we show that cellular factors bind preferentially to the Ins2L 5'UTR, and that PABP and HuD can bind to Ins2 splice variants and regulate its translation. In vitro binding assay with insulin 5'UTR and different HuD isoforms indicate that the 'N' terminal region of HuD is important for RNA binding and insulin translation repression. Using reporter assay we showed that specifically full-length HuD A isoform represses translation of reporter containing insulin 5'UTR. We further show that PABP and HuD interact with each other in RNA-dependent manner and this interaction is affected by glucose and PDI (5'UTR associated translation activator). These results suggest that PABP interacts with HuD in basal glucose conditions making translation inhibitory complex, however upon glucose stimulation this association is affected and PABP is acted upon by PDI resulting in stimulation of insulin translation. Together, our findings snapshot the mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of insulin biosynthesis."
