https://openalex.org/W2069089843,"RNA-seq data from single cells are mapped to their location in complex tissues using gene expression atlases based on in situ hybridization. Spatial localization is a key determinant of cellular fate and behavior, but methods for spatially resolved, transcriptome-wide gene expression profiling across complex tissues are lacking. RNA staining methods assay only a small number of transcripts, whereas single-cell RNA-seq, which measures global gene expression, separates cells from their native spatial context. Here we present Seurat, a computational strategy to infer cellular localization by integrating single-cell RNA-seq data with in situ RNA patterns. We applied Seurat to spatially map 851 single cells from dissociated zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and generated a transcriptome-wide map of spatial patterning. We confirmed Seurat's accuracy using several experimental approaches, then used the strategy to identify a set of archetypal expression patterns and spatial markers. Seurat correctly localizes rare subpopulations, accurately mapping both spatially restricted and scattered groups. Seurat will be applicable to mapping cellular localization within complex patterned tissues in diverse systems."

Current technologies allow whole-transcriptome sequencing of spatially identified cells but lack the throughput needed to characterize complex tissues. Here we present a high-throughput method to identify the spatial origin of cells assayed by single-cell RNA-sequencing within a tissue of interest. Our approach is based on comparing complete, specificity-weighted mRNA profiles of a cell with positional gene expression profiles derived from a gene expression atlas. We show that this method allocates cells to precise locations in the brain of the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii with a success rate of 81%. Our method is applicable to any system that has a reference gene expression database of sufficiently high resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2135604972,"Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1) is an example of a functional long noncoding RNA involved in many biologic processes. However, the mechanisms for Malat1 in myogenesis are unclear. Serum response factor (SRF) is a pivotal transcription factor for muscle proliferation and differentiation and is reported to be a target gene for muscle-specific microRNA-133 (miR-133). In this study, we initially found that silencing Malat1 in the mouse myoblast C2C12 cell line inhibited myocyte differentiation and decreased Srf at both the RNA and protein levels. Srf silencing decreased Malat1 expression as well. Further study revealed that Malat1 contained an miR-133 functional target site, and the interplay between Malat1 and Srf was miR-133 dependent. We demonstrated that Malat1 modulates Srf through miR-133 as a competing endogenous RNA and established a novel connection among Malat1, miR-133, and Srf in myoblast differentiation."

Most preclinical rodent studies are skewed toward the use of male mice to study obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction because of a similar protection observed in female mice. How sex differences in obesity-induced inflammatory responses contribute to these observations is unknown. We have compared and contrasted the effects of high fat diet-induced obesity on glucose metabolism and leukocyte activation in multiple depots in male and female C57Bl/6 mice. With both short term and long term high fat diet, male mice demonstrated increased weight gain and CD11c+ adipose tissue macrophage content compared with female mice despite similar degrees of adipocyte hypertrophy. Competitive bone marrow transplant studies demonstrated that obesity induced a preferential contribution of male hematopoietic cells to circulating leukocytes and adipose tissue macrophages compared with female cells independent of the sex of the recipient. Sex differences in macrophage and hematopoietic cell in vitro activation in response to obesogenic cues were observed to explain these results. In summary, this report demonstrates that male and female leukocytes and hematopoietic stem cells have cell-autonomous differences in their response to obesity that contribute to an amplified response in males compared with females.Background: Diet-induced obesity leads to a chronic low grade inflammation with production of activated macrophages associated with systemic sexually dimorphic metabolic dysfunction.Results: Males have enhanced myelopoiesis and a proinflammatory response to obesity compared with females.Conclusion: Sex differences in myelopoiesis result in dimorphic responses to obesity-induced inflammation.Significance: Given differences in inflammatory responses, targeted treatment strategies are probably required for males and females.

Obesity and its medical sequelae contribute to individual morbidity and are a burden to healthcare costs. Although obesity is rising in prevalence and incidence in the United States, not all obese individuals are at equal risk for obesity-induced cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. For example, reproductive aged women are relatively protected from cardiovascular disease compared with age-matched men (1Meyer M.R. Haas E. Barton M. Gender differences of cardiovascular disease: new perspectives for estrogen receptor signaling.Hypertension. 2006; 47: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Estrogen receptor signaling probably contributes to many of these effects, but because estrogen replacement therapy alone is not sufficient to improve health, other mechanisms are likely involved (2Barrett-Connor E. Women and heart disease: neglected directions for future research.J. Cardiovasc. Transl. Res. 2009; 2: 256-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Sex differences in adipose tissue depot development, cell intrinsic differences in preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation, and modulatory effects of sex steroids on adipocytes have been proposed to contribute to the sexually dimorphic differences in obesity-associated metabolic disease (3Karastergiou K. Smith S.R. Greenberg A.S. Fried S.K. Sex differences in human adipose tissues: the biology of pear shape.Biol. Sex Differ. 2012; 3: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Advances in the field of immunometabolism have established strong connections between the chronic inflammation induced by obesity and diseases such as atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and autoimmune diseases (4Gregor M.F. Hotamisligil G.S. Inflammatory mechanisms in obesity.Ann. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 29: 415-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (2503) Google Scholar). Activation of myeloid cells (monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils) is a prominent signature of human and animal models of obesity both systemically and in tissues such as adipose tissue (5Olefsky J.M. Glass C.K. Macrophages, inflammation, and insulin resistance.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2010; 72: 219-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). Recent investigations have shown that enhanced myelopoiesis with high fat diet exposure in male mice is a significant mechanism in the generation of obesity-induced inflammation (6Singer K.

These monocytes traffic to obese adipose tissue and form CD11c+ M1-like adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) producing activated cytokines and an inflammatory environment that contributes to insulin resistance (11Lumeng C.N.

One aspect that has not been thoroughly investigated is the role that sex differences in inflammatory responses may play in obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Several preclinical studies in rodents identify a blunted pattern of inflammatory gene expression in female visceral adipose tissue with diet-induced obesity (DIO) (12Grove K.L. Fried S.K. Greenberg A.S. Xiao X.Q. Clegg D.J. A microarray analysis of sexual dimorphism of adipose tissues in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice.Int. J.

This correlates with a decrease in crown-like structures, hallmarks of adipose tissue inflammation, in obese female mice compared with males, but the mechanisms that generate this difference have not been elucidated. Sex differences in inflammatory responses in other settings agree with this and suggest that intrinsic differences in innate immunity may regulate metabolism. A wide range of reports have demonstrated sex differences in innate immune responses and hematopoiesis (15Pennell L.M. Galligan C.L. Fish E.N. Sex affects immunity.J. Autoimmun. 2012; 38: J282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Although females have a robust humoral immune mediated response in many autoimmune diseases (15Pennell L.M. Galligan C.L. Fish E.N. Sex affects immunity.J. Autoimmun. 2012; 38: J282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), compared with males, females have attenuated innate immune responses to systemic infections and a lower incidence of severe sepsis (16Marriott I. Huet-Hudson Y.M. Sexual dimorphism in innate immune responses to infectious organisms.Immunol. Res. 2006; 34: 177-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Peripheral blood monocytes from female patients produce less TNFα in response to LPS activation compared with males (17Imahara S.D. Jelacic S. Junker C.E. O'Keefe G.E. The influence of gender on human innate immunity.Surgery. 2005; 138: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Understanding sex differences in metainflammation induced by obesity is required to improve our interpretation of preclinical studies in animal models of obesity. The majority of studies evaluating the inflammatory effects of high fat diet (HFD) report data from either male or female mice exclusively (18Shi H. Kokoeva M.V. Inouye K. Tzameli I. Yin H.

Med. 2011; 17: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar), making it difficult to understand the broader applicability of these observations. This is especially relevant to obesity research, where patients seeking bariatric surgery for obesity treatment are overwhelmingly female (21Pratt G.M. Learn C.A. Hughes G.D. Clark B.L. Warthen M. Pories W. Demographics and outcomes at American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Centers of Excellence.Surg. Endosc. 2009; 23: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because few studies have directly evaluated the metainflammatory response to DIO based on gender, we compared and contrasted innate immune cell activation and hematopoiesis in response to DIO feeding in age-matched male and female C57Bl/6J mice. Our studies identify cell intrinsic enhancement in myeloid cell production from hematopoietic stem cells in male mice as a mechanism that contributes to the sexual dimorphic responses to obesity. Mice used in these experiments were male and female C57Bl/6J or CD45.1 CD57 Bl/6J mice (B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ) purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Heterozygous CD45 1.2 mice were bred for BMT experiments. Mice were fed ad libitum either a control normal diet (ND) consisting of 13% fat (5001, LabDiet) or a HFD of 60% of calories from fat (D12492, Research Diets, Inc.) starting at 6 weeks of age for 6 or 16 weeks duration. Glucose tolerance testing was performed after 6 h of fasting. Animals were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and given free access to food and water. All animal use was in compliance with the Institute of Laboratory Animal Research Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals at the University of Michigan (Animal welfare assurance number A3114-01). Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS; Columbus Instruments) analysis of metabolism in individually housed mice was performed at the University of Michigan Metabolomics and Obesity Center Animal Phenotyping Core. Adipose tissue fractionation and flow cytometry analysis were performed as described previously (22Morris D.L. Oatmen K.E. Wang T. DelProposto J.L. Lumeng C.N. CX3CR1 deficiency does not influence trafficking of adipose tissue macrophages in mice with diet-induced obesity.Obesity. 2012; 20: 1189-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). SVF cells were stained with CD64 PE, CD45.1 PECy7, CD45.2 e450, and CD11c-PE-Cy7 (eBioscience) (23Lumeng C.N. DelProposto J.B. Westcott D.J. Saltiel A.R. Phenotypic switching of adipose tissue macrophages with obesity is generated by spatiotemporal differences in macrophage subtypes.Diabetes. 2008; 57: 3239-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), and gating was performed for macrophage populations and by CD45 gates to determine donor or recipient cell populations. Bone marrow from one femur was flushed with PBS and, using a syringe, made into a single cell suspension and spun. Pellet was then treated with RBC lysis solution for 5 min. After resuspension in PBS and washing, cells were stained with lineage markers on APC (CD4, CD5, CD8, CD11b, B220 (CD45R), Gr1, Ter119, and CD41), CD117-APCCy7, Sca1-PECy7, CD16/32 PerCP5.5 (eBioscience), CD150-PE, and Endoglin-Pacific Blue (Biolegend) and gating as described by Pronk et al.

Bone marrow from a femur was flushed with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. This marrow was then treated with fatty acid-free BSA or palmitic acid (10 μm; purchased from Sigma) in fatty acid-free BSA for 1 h at 37 ºC. Cells were then resuspended in methocult medium and plated at 10,000 cells/plate/protocol (Stem Cell Technologies, Inc.). After 7 days, colonies were counted. Bone marrow cells were isolated from donor groups (25Erickson J.C. Clegg K.E. Palmiter R.D. Sensitivity to leptin and susceptibility to seizures of mice lacking neuropeptide Y.Nature. 1996; 381: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar) and injected retro-orbitally into lethally irradiated (900 rads) 6-week-old recipient mice (10 million cells/mouse). Animals were treated with antibiotics (polymyxin and neomycin) for 4 weeks post-BM transplantation. Following 2 weeks of normal chow diet, they were started on ND or HFD diets as detailed under “Results.” Glucose tolerance testing was performed as described (10Westcott D.J. Delproposto J.B. Geletka L.M. Wang T. Singer K. Saltiel A.R. Lumeng C.N. MGL1 promotes adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance by regulating 7/4hi monocytes in obesity.J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206: 3143-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) after 6 h of fasting with an intraperitoneal injection of 0.7 g/kg dextrose. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. Two-way analysis of variance was performed with factors of sex and diet. If there was a main effect for either factor, then t tests were performed for male versus female differences within each diet or for diet groups within each sex, respectively. To assess sex differences in inflammatory responses to obesity, 6-week-old male and female C57Bl/6J mice were fed control ND or HFD (60% kcal from fat) ad libitum (Fig. 1A). To assess when divergent inflammatory responses to obesity occur between male and female mice, we assessed sex differences in metabolism and inflammatory cell activation in short term (6-week) and long term (16-week) DIO paradigms. After 6 weeks, ND-fed males and females gained similar amounts of body weight (p = 0.78). HFD-fed males gained 54% and females gained 42% of their original weight (p = 0.046) (Fig. 1B) associated with a significant increase in gonadal fat pad weight (gonadal white adipose tissue; GWAT) in males compared with females (Fig. 1C). Body composition assessment at 9 weeks showed that ND-fed females had a higher percentage of body fat compared with ND-fed males (Fig. 1D). Both HFD-fed male and female mice showed a significant increase in percentage of body fat compared with ND-fed controls. In HFD conditions, male mice had a higher percentage of body fat and lower percentage of lean mass than female mice. To evaluate the mechanism for the differential response to HFD between sexes, mice were assessed for food intake and energy expenditure in metabolic cages. Males and females had the same daily caloric intake regardless of diet (Fig. 1E). Female mice on ND had increased total energy expenditure (Fig. 1F) compared with their male counterparts. HFD-fed female mice had higher energy expenditure compared with males (Fig. 1F). The respiratory exchange ratio was similar between sexes and was decreased in HFD-fed mice compared with ND in both sexes. There were no significant differences in fat or glucose oxidation between sexes in ND-fed mice. However, HFD-fed female mice had increased glucose oxidation compared with male mice and a significant increase in oxygen consumption (VO2) and activity (Fig. 1G). After 16 weeks of HFD, there was significant weight gain in both sexes (Fig. 1H). HFD-fed male mice gained more weight and were significantly heavier than female mice at the end of the study (Fig. 1I, p < 0.0001). HFD induced significant hypertrophy of GWAT in both sexes, with GWAT weighing more in males compared with females (Fig. 1J). However, when corrected for total body weight, GWAT was expanded equally between male and female mice with HFD (Fig. 1K). When subcutaneous inguinal fat pads (inguinal white adipose tissue; IWAT) were evaluated, HFD induced a significant expansion of IWAT in male mice that was more profound compared with female mice (Fig. 1L), especially when expressed as a percentage of total body weight (Fig. 1M). Assessment of adipocyte cross-sectional area demonstrated the induction of adipocyte hypertrophy in GWAT in both sexes with HFD. After 6 weeks of diet, female mean adipocyte size was smaller then male adipocytes (Fig. 1N), but the average size and degree of adipocyte hypertrophy was similar between sexes after 16 weeks of HFD (Fig. 1O). Evaluation of the size distribution showed that HFD-fed female mice had an increase in the proportion of medium sized adipocytes compared with males (Fig. 1O). Overall, these studies demonstrate that the relative protection from DIO in female mice is evident as early as 4–6 weeks and is due to an increase in energy expenditure characterized by increased fat and glucose oxidation as well as activity. Fasting glucose levels were elevated to a similar degree in both males and females after 4 weeks of diet (Fig. 2A). Fasting insulin levels were not changed with HFD feeding in either sex during this short term diet challenge, but they were lower for all female groups compared with males (Fig. 2B). After 10 weeks of diet challenge, serum glucose and insulin were assessed in the long term HFD feeding. HFD-fed male mice had significantly higher fasting blood glucose and insulin levels compared with ND controls (Fig. 2C). At this time, no significant differences in fasting glucose and insulin levels were seen in HFD females compared with ND-fed controls. A glucose tolerance test was performed at 12 weeks of feeding after 6 h of fasting. No significant differences in glucose tolerance testing were seen between ND-fed male and female mice (Fig. 2D). Both HFD-fed male and female mice had glucose intolerance compared with sex-matched ND controls (Fig. 2E). Compared with HFD females, HFD-fed male mice demonstrated more glucose intolerance, primarily in the later stages of the glucose tolerance test. At 16 weeks of HFD, serum analysis showed significantly higher fed glucose levels in HFD-fed animals (Fig. 2F). Females had lower insulin levels than males (Fig. 2G). Liver microsteatosis was noted in male HFD mice as early as at 6 weeks of HFD challenge (Fig. 2H). Liver steatosis at 16 weeks of diet was prominent in male mice on HFD but not females (Fig. 2I). These results demonstrate that short term DIO induces similar degrees of fasting hyperglycemia in males and females, with male mice showing increased adipose tissue hypertrophy. With long term DIO, hyperinsulinism and liver steatosis are more prominent in males despite similar increases in adipocyte hypertrophy and adiposity in females. Given this, we next examined how inflammatory responses to DIO differed between males and females as a contributor to the metabolic dysfunction seen in males. Crown-like structures are a hallmark of obesity-induced inflammation and ATM accumulation in adipose tissue. Histologic analysis of GWAT from 16-week HFD-fed mice demonstrated a significant induction of crown-like structures in male mice but not females (Fig. 3A) despite similar adipocyte hypertrophy. Gene expression analysis demonstrated an increase in several proinflammatory genes (Il1b, Nos2, and Tgfb) in GWAT in male HFD mice, whereas Il10 was unchanged (Fig. 3B). Consistent with the observed differences in the recruitment of monocyte/macrophages into GWAT, Ccl2/Mcp1 expression was increased in males on HFD but not females (Fig. 3C). Expression of leptin (Lep) was increased to similar degrees in males and females with HFD (Fig. 3C). Pparg was increased in males on HFD but not females. Adipoq was increased in HFD females but not males (Fig. 3C). In IWAT, a different pattern in gene expression was observed. Il1b was reduced on HFD, and Nos2 was increased in both males and females on HFD (Fig. 3D), with no difference in Il10. Ccl2 increased with HFD but with much lower levels of expression and lower levels in female mice (Fig. 3E). Lep had expression patterns similar to those of GWAT, but Pparg was higher in IWAT of females and Adipoq was higher in GWAT. Overall, these data show that the activation of inflammatory gene expression in GWAT with HFD is more prominent in males compared with females. To date, few, if any, studies have systematically compared adipose tissue leukocytes in diet-matched male and female mice. To assess this, we examined ATM induction in GWAT from 16-week-fed mice by flow cytometry (Fig. 4A). ATMs were defined using CD64, a recently identified specific marker for murine macrophages (26Gautier E.L. Shay T. Miller J. Greter M. Jakubzick C. Ivanov S. Helft J. Chow A. Elpek K.G. Gordonov S. Mazloom A.R. Ma'ayan A. Chua W.J. Hansen T.H. Turley S.J. Merad M. Randolph G.J. Gene-expression profiles and transcriptional regulatory pathways that underlie the identity and diversity of mouse tissue macrophages.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 1118-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). Total CD45+ leukocytes in the SVF were similar in male and female ND-fed mice (Fig. 4B). With HFD, CD45+ cells were induced in males but not females. In ND-fed mice, males had more total CD64+ ATMs in the SVF compared with females (Fig. 4C) even when normalized to fat pad weight (Fig. 4D). The difference between HFD male and female ATMs was primarily driven by the substantial induction of CD11c+ ATMs in male GWAT that was absent from HFD females (Fig. 4, E and F). Interestingly, female mice demonstrated an increase in CD11c− ATMs with HFD, which are primarily composed of a resident macrophage population (Fig. 4G). This induction was not seen in males. These changes resulted in an increase in the ratio of CD11c+ to CD11c− ATMs in male obese mice but not females (Fig. 4H). Dendritic cell populations were higher in females compared with males and were only induced in male GWAT with HFD (Fig. 4I). Overall, this demonstrates that HFD generates different patterns of ATM accumulation in GWAT in males and females. The increase in CD11c+ ATMs in male mice occurred despite similar adipocyte and GWAT hypertrophy between sexes. This suggests that a mechanism of increased adipose tissue inflammation in males relates to enhancement in the myeloid machinery that promotes ATM trafficking to adipose tissue, the primary mechanism of CD11c+ ATM accumulation (9Weisberg S.P. Hunter D. Huber R. Lemieux J. Slaymaker S. Vaddi K. Charo I. Leibel R.L. Ferrante Jr., A.W. CCR2 modulates inflammatory and metabolic effects of high-fat feeding.J. Clin.

MGL1 promotes adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance by regulating 7/4hi monocytes in obesity.J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206: 3143-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Obesity is associated with increases in circulating myeloid cells (neutrophils and monocytes) in human and mouse models (10Westcott D.J. Delproposto J.B. Geletka L.M. Wang T. Singer K. Saltiel A.R. Lumeng C.N. MGL1 promotes adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance by regulating 7/4hi monocytes in obesity.J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206: 3143-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Since CD11c+ ATMs are primarily generated by recruitment from BM-derived monocytes, we next examined whether alterations in circulating leukocytes may be a mechanism that contributes to the differences seen with chronic HFD feeding in male and female mice. Whereas ND female and male mice had similar CD115+ monocytes in the blood (Fig. 4J), HFD increased the total circulating monocyte pool in males but not females. Classical Ly6chi monocytes trended toward being higher in lean males compared with females (Fig. 4K). HFD feeding decreased the quantity of circulating Ly6chi monocytes in males after 16 weeks but not in females. The accumulation of ATMs might be potentiated in males based on fundamental differences in myeloid cell function or production from the bone marrow. To assess this, we quantified hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow of the mice. In ND-fed male and female mice, no significant differences were noted in the quantity of lineage-negative progenitors, LSK (Lin− Sca1+ Kit+) stem cell-enriched populations, or long term HSCs (Lin− Sca+ Kit+ Endoglin+ CD150+). However, with HFD exposure, there was a significant increase in Lin−, granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP), pre-granulocyte-macrophage, and HSC populations in males on HFD, with a marginally significant increase in LSK in males but not in females (Fig. 4L). This demonstrates a coupling between the HFD-induced accumulation of CD11c+ ATMs and myeloid progenitor expansion in male mice that was not observed in female mice. Given that during short term diet exposure, males and females had similar weight gain and hyperglycemia without the generalized obesity and obesity-induced hyperinsulinemia, we wanted to use this paradigm to assess whether inflammation occurred in a sexually dimorphic fashion before obesity. Gene expression analysis identified significant increases in Tnfa and Il6 in males but not females with short term HFD. HFD increased H2Ab1 expression in GWAT in both sexes. As in long term diets, Il10 was not changed significantly by 6 weeks of HFD (Fig. 5A). We next evaluated ATM accumulation in this short term paradigm. At this younger age, males and females had s"

Here, to explore the role of Fut8 expression in hepatocarcinogensis, we established the chemical-induced HCC models in the male wild-type (WT; Fut8+/+), hetero (Fut8+/-), and knockout (KO; mice by use of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and pentobarbital (PB). In the Fut8+/+ and Fut8+/- mice, multiple large and vascularized nodules were induced with an increased expression of Fut8 after DEN and PB treatment. However, the formation of HCC in Fut8-/- mice was suppressed almost completely. This potent inhibitory effect of Fut8 deficiency on tumorigenesis was also confirmed by the abolished tumor formation of Fnt8 KO human hepatoma cell line cells by use of a xenograft tumor model. Furthermore, loss of the Fut8 gene resulted in attenuated responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in the HepG2 cell line, which provides the possible mechanisms for the contribution of Fut8 to hepatocarcinogensis. Taken together, our study clearly demonstrated that core fucosylation acts as a critical functional modulator in the liver and implicated Fut8 as a prognostic marker, as well as a novel, therapeutic target for HCC.—Wang, Y., Fukuda, T., Isaji, T., Lu, J., Im, S., Hang, Q., Gu, W., Hou, S., Ohtsubo, K., Gu, J.

https://openalex.org/W2035457551,"Background It is possible that cross-over studies included in current systematic reviews are being inadequately assessed, because the current risk of bias tools do not consider possible biases specific to cross-over design. We performed this study to evaluate whether this was being done in cross-over studies included in Cochrane Systematic Reviews (CSRs). Methods We searched the Cochrane Library (up to 2013 issue 5) for CSRs that included at least one cross-over trial. Two authors independently undertook the study selection and data extraction. A random sample of the CSRs was selected and we evaluated whether the cross-over trials in these CSRs were assessed according to criteria suggested by the Cochrane handbook. In addition we reassessed the risk of bias of these cross-over trials by a checklist developed form the Cochrane handbook. Results We identified 688 CSRs that included one or more cross-over studies. We chose a random sample of 60 CSRs and these included 139 cross-over studies. None of these CSRs undertook a risk of bias assessment specific for cross-over studies. In fact items specific for cross-over studies were seldom considered anywhere in quality assessment of these CSRs. When we reassessed the risk of bias, including the 3 items specific to cross-over trials, of these 139 studies, a low risk of bias was judged for appropriate cross-over design in 110(79%), carry-over effects in 48(34%) and for reporting data in all stages of the trial in 114(82%).Assessment of biases in cross-over trials could affect the GRADE assessment of a review’s findings. Conclusion The current Cochrane risk of bias tool is not adequate to assess cross-over studies. Items specific to cross-over trials leading to potential risk of bias are generally neglected in CSRs. A proposed check list for the evaluation of cross-over trials is provided."
https://openalex.org/W1970094205,"Human growth hormone (hGH) plays critical roles in pubertal mammary gland growth, development, and sexual maturation. Accumulated studies have reported that autocrine/paracrine hGH is an orthotopically expressed oncoprotein that promotes normal mammary epithelial cell oncogenic transformation. Autocrine/paracrine hGH has also been reported to promote mammary epithelial cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely obscure. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are reported to be involved in regulation of multiple cellular functions of cancer. To determine whether autocrine/paracrine hGH promotes EMT and invasion through modulation of miRNA expression, we performed microarray profiling using MCF-7 cells stably expressing wild type or a translation-deficient hGH gene and identified miR-96-182-183 as an autocrine/paracrine hGH-regulated miRNA cluster. Forced expression of miR-96-182-183 conferred on epithelioid MCF-7 cells a mesenchymal phenotype and promoted invasive behavior in vitro and dissemination in vivo. Moreover, we observed that miR-96-182-183 promoted EMT and invasion by directly and simultaneously suppressing BRMS1L (breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1-like) gene expression. miR-96 and miR-182 also targeted GHR, providing a potential negative feedback loop in the hGH-GHR signaling pathway. We further demonstrated that autocrine/paracrine hGH stimulated miR-96-182-183 expression and facilitated EMT and invasion via STAT3 and STAT5 signaling. Consistent with elevated expression of autocrine/paracrine hGH in metastatic breast cancer tissue, miR-96-182-183 expression was also remarkably enhanced. Hence, we delineate the roles of the miRNA-96-182-183 cluster and elucidate a novel hGH-GHR-STAT3/STAT5-miR-96-182-183-BRMS1L-ZEB1/E47-EMT/invasion axis, which provides further understanding of the mechanism of autocrine/paracrine hGH-stimulated EMT and invasion in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W588559152,"The tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is frequently mutated in colon cancer. However, the potential contribution of loss of PTEN to colon cancer progression remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that PTEN overexpression or knockdown in Lovo colon cancer cells decreased or increased paxillin expression, respectively. Moreover, paxillin reversed PTEN-mediated inhibition of Lovo cell invasion and migration. Overexpression of PTEN in an orthotropic colon cancer nude mice model inhibited tumor formation and progression. In addition, PTEN protein level was negatively correlated with that of paxillin in human colon cancer tissues. Mechanistically, we identified three NF-κB binding sites on paxillin promoter and confirmed that paxillin was a direct transcriptional target of NF-κB. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which PTEN inhibits the progression of colon cancer by inhibiting paxillin expression downstream of PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway. Thereby, PTEN/PI3K/AKT/NF-κB/paxillin signaling cascade is an attractive therapeutic target for colon cancer progression."

Reactivation of these latently infected cells may result in three fates: 1) cell death due to a viral cytopathic effect, 2) cell death due to immune clearance, or 3) a retreat into latency. Uncovering the dynamics of HIV gene expression and silencing in the latent reservoir will be crucial for developing an HIV-1 cure. Here we identify and characterize an intracellular circuit involving TRIM32, an HIV activator, and miR-155, a microRNA that may promote a return to latency in these transiently activated reservoir cells. Notably, we demonstrate that TRIM32, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promotes reactivation from latency by directly modifying IκBα, leading to a novel mechanism of NF-κB induction not involving IκB kinase activation."
https://openalex.org/W2106471405,"Introduction FEM-PrEP did not demonstrate a reduction in HIV acquisition because of low study pill adherence. Yet, plasma and intracellular drug concentrations indicated that some participants had evidence of recent pill use. We conducted a follow-up study to identify, among other topics, participants’ reasons for taking the study pill. Methods Qualitative, semi-structured interviews (SSIs) were conducted with 88 FEM-PrEP participants. Participants were purposefully selected based on their adherence drug concentrations collected during FEM-PrEP and placed into three adherence interview groups: “high,” “moderate,” and “none/scarce.” Participants in the high and moderate groups described reasons why they adhered most or some of the time, including factors that facilitated their adherence. Participants in all groups described what they believed made it possible for other FEM-PrEP participants to adhere. In addition, 224 FEM-PrEP participants reported on their reasons for taking the study pills through a quantitative, audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI). Thematic analysis and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the qualitative and quantitative data, respectively. Results Five themes were identified from the SSIs as facilitating factors of adherence: 1) participants’ support for the research, 2) HIV risk reduction, 3) routine formation and use of tools, 4) adherence counseling, and 5) partner awareness and support. Participants described similar facilitators when they spoke about other participants’ adherence. Among the 172 participants who reported in ACASI that they had taken a study pill, wanting to help answer the research question was the most frequently stated reason for taking the pills (94%, n = 161). We also found evidence of preventive misconception. Conclusions Adherence was facilitated by personal motivations, such as risk reduction and interest in the research outcome, and by adherence strategies consisting of external cues, reminders, and support. These findings can inform future HIV prevention clinical trials and the rollout of effective antiretroviral-based HIV prevention technologies for women."
https://openalex.org/W2074913439,"The development of insulin resistance (IR) in the liver is a key pathophysiologic event in the development of type 2 diabetes. Although insulin loses its ability to suppress glucose production, it largely retains its capacity to drive lipogenesis. This selective IR results in the characteristic hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia of type 2 diabetes. The delineation of two branched pathways of insulin receptor (InsR) signaling to glucose versus triglyceride production, one through FoxO and the other through SREBP-1c, provides a mechanism to account for this pathophysiological abnormality.

Following attachment to collagen-coated cultureware, cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 3 h in Medium 199 + 10% FBS (Life Technologies). Cells were then washed twice and incubated overnight in serum-free medium (see below) prior to the experimental assays described below. For CHI treatment, 100 nm insulin (Novolog) was added to the culture medium at each of the above steps. Serum-free medium (Medium 199 + 1% BSA) was replaced with glucose production medium (glucose- and phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 1% BSA, 3.3. g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 20 mm calcium lactate, and 2 mm sodium pyruvate). Cells were incubated with 100 μm 8-CPT-cAMP (Sigma), cAMP + insulin (1 or 10 nm), or vehicle for 5 h. Glucose released into the culture medium was measured via peroxidase-glucose oxidase assay (Sigma) and normalized to protein content. Cells to be incubated with cAMP + insulin were pretreated with insulin for 1 h in serum-free medium prior to the addition of glucose production cocktails. For S961 and Akti-1/2 treatment, inhibitors were added to serum-free medium for a 30-min pretreatment period prior to pretreatment with insulin (or vehicle), and then added again when medium was replaced with glucose production cocktail. Additional cells were treated in parallel to be used for measurement of gluconeogenic gene expression (see below). Following overnight serum starvation (Medium 199 + 0.25% fatty acid-free BSA (Fisher)), medium was replaced with fresh serum-free medium containing insulin (1 or 10 nm) or vehicle. For S961 and Akti-1/2 treatment, inhibitors were added to serum-free medium for a 30-min pretreatment prior to medium replacement and then added again with subsequent medium changes. Following a 2-h insulin treatment period, cells were washed twice with PBS and radiolabeling was carried out in Medium 199 + 0.25% fatty acid-free BSA spiked with 0.6 μCi/ml [1,2-14C]acetic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with or without insulin and/or inhibitors over 3 h. Lipids were extracted using 3:2 hexane:isopropyl alcohol, dried in scintillation vials under N2 gas, and resuspended in 2:1 chloroform:methanol. Radiocarbon labeling of resuspended lipids was determined by liquid scintillation counting (PerkinElmer) and normalized to total cellular protein content. Additional cells were treated in parallel without radiolabeling to be used for measurement of lipogenic gene expression (see below). Following overnight serum starvation, cells were washed twice with PBS and replaced with serum-free medium (Medium 199 + 1% BSA) containing insulin at the concentrations indicated in the figures for 30 min. For S961 and Akti-1/2 treatment, inhibitors were added to serum-free medium 30 min prior to insulin treatment and then added again along with insulin. Following insulin treatment, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2% NP-40, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 30 mm Na4P2O7, 0.2% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with protease/phosphatase inhibitors (Cell Signaling). Protein concentration was assessed by bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma). Antibodies used were all purchased from Cell Signaling with the exception of SREBP-1c (Novus Biologicals) and glucokinase, which was a gift of Mark Magnuson (Vanderbilt University). Densitometric analysis was performed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Total RNA was isolated from hepatocytes treated as above using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using the GoScript reverse transcription system (Promega). cDNAs were diluted 1:10, and RT-PCR was performed using a DNA Engine Opticon 2 System (Bio-Rad) with SYBR Green (Promega). Primer sequences are available upon request. Gene expression levels were normalized to TATA-binding protein (Tbp) using the 2−ΔΔCt method (20.Pajvani U.B. Qiang L. Kangsamaksin T. Kitajewski J.

Although precedent exists for down-regulation of InsR in vivo in humans, there has been some controversy regarding its relevance in rodent models of obesity (21.Hurrell D.G. Pedersen O. Kahn C.R.

Some of the variability in the data may stem from differences in the age of the mice, or the cause or degree of obesity. We have therefore assessed for liver expression of InsR in Insr+/− mice, a lean model of insulin resistance exhibiting compensatory hyperinsulinemia without hyperglycemia (22.Accili D. Drago J.

We treated mouse primary hepatocytes with 100 nm insulin for 24 h to mimic CHI, followed by acute (30-min) treatment with 10 nm insulin (10.Shimomura I. Matsuda M. Hammer R.E. Bashmakov Y. Brown M.S.

CHI treatment resulted in an ∼50% reduction in InsR protein levels, indicating InsR down-regulation (Fig. 1C). Expectedly, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt at Thr-308 and Ser-473 was markedly reduced, although basal levels of Akt phosphorylation were higher than in controls (Fig. 1C) (9.Gonzalez E.

Phosphorylation of Akt substrates FoxO1 (as evidenced by electrophoretic mobility shift), GSK3β, and mTOR was similarly reduced, as was insulin-stimulated cleavage of SREBP-1c (Fig. 1C). We next assessed insulin suppression of cAMP-induced GP. CHI treatment did not affect basal or maximal cAMP-induced GP but abrogated its suppression by insulin (Fig. 2A). Moreover, CHI treatment significantly dampened cAMP-induced expression of G6pc and Pck1 as well as their inhibition by insulin (Fig. 2, B and C). Conversely, insulin-stimulated de novo lipogenesis was unchanged relative to vehicle treatment (Fig. 2D), consistent with previous data in rat hepatocytes (11.Amatruda J. M Newmeyer H. W Chang C.L. Insulin-induced alterations in insulin binding and insulin action in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes.Diabetes. 1982; 31: 145-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, CHI-treated cells showed a non-significant trend toward increased rates of DNL in the basal and insulin-stimulated states relative to control cells. Although expression of the genes for glucokinase and SREBP-1c did not respond to insulin over the time course of the DNL assay in these cells, baseline expression of these genes increased following CHI (Fig. 2, E–G). These findings were borne out at the protein level (Fig. 1). Thus, we conclude from these experiments that CHI treatment renders primary hepatocytes selectively resistant to the effects of insulin on glucose production. The recapitulation of selective IR in response to CHI treatment is consistent with findings in hyperinsulinemic humans (26.Kahn C. R Neville Jr., D. M Gorden P. Freychet P. Roth J. Insulin receptor defect in insulin resistance: studies in the obese-hyperglycemic mouse.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and mice (26.Kahn C. R Neville Jr., D. M Gorden P. Freychet P. Roth J.

Invest. 1981; 68: 957-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). To independently test the hypothesis, we used a competitive peptide inhibitor of InsR, S961 (17.Schäffer L. Brand C.L. Hansen B.F. Ribel U. Shaw A.C. Slaaby R. Sturis J. A novel high-affinity peptide antagonist to the insulin receptor.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 376: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We treated cells with a range of concentrations of S961 and assessed its inhibition of the actions of a fixed dose of insulin (10 nm) on glucose and lipid production. S961 treatment dose-dependently inhibited phosphorylation of IRS1 (as evidenced by electrophoretic mobility shift) and Akt at Thr-308 and Ser-473, as well as of Akt targets FoxO1 and GSK3β (Ser-9) (Fig. 3, A and B). Based on densitometric analysis of the Western blot findings in Fig. 3A, we determined that the IC50 of S961 for the phosphorylation of Akt was 0.9 nm at Thr-308 and 2.7 nm at Ser-473, and for the phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser-9, the IC50 was 1.0 nm (Fig. 3B). Levels of total InsRβ were unaffected. SREBP-1c cleavage was also not notably affected by antagonist treatment. These effects on the InsR phosphorylation cascade translated into reduced ability of insulin to suppress GP (Fig. 3C). Insulin decreased cAMP-induced GP by 31% in control cells, but this effect was lost in the presence of 10−6 and 10−7 m S961. Even at the lowest concentration of antagonist tested (10−10 m), insulin inhibition of GP was only 76% of control. Antagonist treatment did not affect maximal cAMP-induced GP. S961 treatment also dose-dependently blunted insulin's inhibition of G6pc and Pck1 expression (Fig. 3, D and E). However, unlike in the case of GP, insulin reduced expression of these genes to control levels even at 10−9 m S961. As in the case of GP, treatment with S961 did not alter basal de novo lipogenesis (Fig. 3F). In control cells, insulin stimulated lipogenesis by 78%. This effect was blocked by maximal doses of S961. However, unlike the lowering of GP, insulin-stimulated lipogenesis was unchanged from control even at 10−9 m S961. The calculated IC50 values were 2.3 nm for GP and 10.5 nm for de novo lipogenesis (Fig. 3G). Thus, there exists a nearly 5-fold difference in the dose of antagonist required to affect insulin's action on GP as compared with lipogenesis. These findings reveal inherent differences in the insulin responsiveness of GP and de novo lipogenesis in isolated hepatocytes. Previous studies indicate that Akt represents the most distal shared element of InsR signaling to glucose and lipid metabolism (28.Matsumoto M. Pocai A. Rossetti L. Depinho R.A. Accili D.

Integrated control of hepatic lipogenesis versus glucose production requires FoxO transcription factors.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of inhibiting Akt on GP and DNL using the chemical inhibitor Akti-1/2 in primary hepatocytes (18.Lindsley C.W. Zhao Z. Leister W.H. Robinson R.G. Barnett S.F. Defeo-Jones D. Jones R.E. Hartman G.D. Huff J.R. Huber H.E. Duggan M.E. Allosteric Akt (PKB) inhibitors: discovery and SAR of isozyme selective inhibitors.Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005; 15: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Akti-1/2 treatment blocked insulin-dependent Akt phosphorylation and decreased phosphorylation of FoxO1, GSK3β, and mTOR without affecting IRS2 (Fig. 4A). Of note, treatment with the inhibitor was without notable effect on SREBP-1c cleavage. Akti-1/2 treatment prevented insulin's ability to significantly inhibit cAMP-induced GP at all but the lowest concentration (1 μm) of inhibitor tested (Fig. 4B). Similar to the effect of CHI treatment, Akti-1/2 inhibition decreased the maximal cAMP-induced expression of G6pc and Pck1 (Fig. 4, C and D). Although Akti-1/2 prevented the lowering of G6pc expression to normal levels by insulin, it did allow for an ∼50% repression (Fig. 4C), whereas Akti-1/2 did not prevent the lowering of Pck1 expression to basal levels by insulin (Fig. 4D), similar to previous findings (31.Logie L. Ruiz-Alcaraz A.J. Keane M. Woods Y.L. Bain J. Marquez R. Alessi D.R. Sutherland C.

Finally, treatment with the highest dose of Akti-1/2 resulted in a non-significant trend to increased basal de novo lipogenesis. At this concentration of inhibitor, however, insulin treatment was unable to further induce DNL relative to vehicle-treated control. Unlike in the case of GP, insulin tre"

Under natural growth conditions, all bacteria continually face changing nutrient availability, and consequently they must strategically adapt their metabolic capabilities in response to such changes. In addition to utilizing various storage compounds, the capacity to take up and use dissolved carboxylic acids, such as acetate, lactate, pyruvate, and succinate, from the surrounding environment is important for sustainable growth under many conditions (1.Kreth J. Lengeler J.W. Jahreis K. Characterization of pyruvate uptake in Escherichia coli K-12.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e67125Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 2.Pinchuk G.E. Geydebrekht O.V. Hill E.A.

The enzymic interconversion of acetate and acetyl-coenzyme A in Escherichia coli.J. Gen. Microbiol. 1977; 102: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The ability to assimilate organic carbons also exists in some autotrophic bacteria, including cyanobacteria, even though most are able to synthesize all essential precursor metabolites from CO2 (4.Ihlenfeldt M.J. Gibson J. Acetate uptake by the unicellular cyanobacteria Synechococcus and Aphanocapsa.Arch. Microbiol. 1977; 113: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The assimilation of dissolved carboxylic acids by heterotrophic bacteria has been known and studied for decades (5.Kay W.W. Kornberg H.L. The uptake of C4-dicarboxylic acids by Escherichia coli.Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 18: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 6.Gutowski S.J. Rosenberg H. Succinate uptake and related proton movements in Escherichia coli K12.Biochem. J. 1975; 152: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Acetate is one of the most common and important carbon sources for many bacteria, and acetate is frequently used as a carbon source by eukaryotic microalgae (7.Wright R.T. Hobbie J.E. Use of glucose and acetate by bacteria and algae in aquatic ecosystems.Ecology. 1966; 47: 447-464Crossref Google Scholar, 8.Gibbs M. Gfeller R.P. Chen C. Fermentative metabolism of Chlamydomonas reinhardii III. Photoassimilation of acetate.Plant Physiol. 1986; 82: 160-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once acetate is transported into the cytosol, it is first converted by acetyl-CoA synthetase to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), 2The abbreviations used are: acetyl-CoAacetyl coenzyme AFaRLiPfar-red light photoacclimationICLisocitrate lyasePCCPasteur Culture CollectionPHBpoly-3-hydroxybutyrateTCAtricarboxylic acid. which can then be used by the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle or the glyoxylate cycle to produce other important precursor metabolites, such as 2-oxoglutarate and oxaloacetate (9.Kornberg H.

Sir Hans Adolf Krebs, who also established the urea/ornithine cycle as well as the TCA cycle, discovered the glyoxylate cycle (11.Kornberg H.L. Krebs H.A. Synthesis of cell constituents from C2-units by a modified tricarboxylic acid cycle.Nature. 1957; 179: 988-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 12.Kornberg H. Krebs and his trinity of cycles.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The glyoxylate cycle is usually described as a modified TCA cycle, because it shares the activities of malate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and aconitase with the TCA cycle (Fig. 1). However, the difference lies in the two key enzymes that are used in the glyoxylate cycle but which are not used in the TCA cycle, namely isocitrate lyase (AceA) and malate synthase (AceB), which convert isocitrate and acetyl-CoA into succinate and malate (Fig. 1). In more detail, isocitrate is split into succinate and glyoxylate by isocitrate lyase, after which glyoxylate and acetyl-CoA are condensed to form malate with the release of CoA by malate synthase. Malate is further converted to oxaloacetate by malate dehydrogenase to continue the cycle, and succinate is released as the net product. Overall, the net reaction of the glyoxylate cycle, which can be used to produce precursors for amino acid or carbohydrate biosynthesis, allows cells to convert two acetyl-CoA units into succinate and avoid the CO2-releasing steps of the TCA cycle. Thus, the glyoxylate cycle enables cells to utilize C2 units (i.e. acetyl-CoA) more efficiently for biomass production. These C2 units can be derived from ethanol or acetate as the sole carbon source, and collectively these reactions are usually correlated with the ability of bacteria to assimilate acetate (13.Dunn M.F. Ramírez-Trujillo J.A. Hernández-Lucas I. Major roles of isocitrate lyase and malate synthase in bacterial and fungal pathogenesis.Microbiology. 2009; 155: 3166-3175Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The glyoxylate cycle has been found in many chlorophototrophic bacteria (14.Zhang S. Bryant D.A. Learning new tricks from an old cycle: the TCA cycle in cyanobacteria, algae and plants.Perspect. Phycol. 2014; 1: 73-86Crossref Google Scholar, 15.Tang K.-H. Tang Y.J. Blankenship R.E. Carbon metabolic pathways in phototrophic bacteria and their broader evolutionary implications.Front. Microbiol. 2011; 2: 165Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Isocitrate lyase and malate synthase are found in all chlorophototrophic members of the Chloroflexi (e.g. Chloroflexus spp., Oscillochloris trichoides, and Roseiflexus spp.). By using the glyoxylate cycle, all of these organisms are able to photoassimilate acetate, and some can even grow heterotrophically on acetate (16.Sirevåg R.

Microbiol. 2011; 77: 6181-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, the glyoxylate cycle occurs in most purple sulfur bacteria, which can also photoassimilate acetate. However, no genes encoding these enzymes have yet been identified in most purple non-sulfur bacteria (15.Tang K.-H. Tang Y.J. Blankenship R.E. Carbon metabolic pathways in phototrophic bacteria and their broader evolutionary implications.Front. Microbiol. 2011; 2: 165Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Heliobacteria, green sulfur bacteria, and Chloracidobacterium thermophilum lack isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, and thus the glyoxylate cycle is absent in these bacteria. Interesting, heliobacteria and green sulfur bacteria use a different acetate assimilation mechanism, the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA by pyruvate synthase, and thus these bacteria are thus able to assimilate both acetate and CO2 at the same time (18.Feng X. Tang K.-H. Blankenship R.E. Tang Y.J. Metabolic flux analysis of the mixotrophic metabolisms in the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobaculum tepidum.J. Biol.

Cyanobacteria are a large group of oxygenic chlorophototrophic bacteria with highly diverse metabolic capabilities, but the occurrence of the glyoxylate cycle in these organisms has remained controversial (20.Zhang S. Bryant D.A. The tricarboxylic acid cycle in cyanobacteria.Science. 2011; 334: 1551-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Although it has been reported that isocitrate lyase and/or malate synthase activities were detected in some cyanobacteria (21.Eley J.H.

Microbiol. 1967; 49: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and that some cyanobacteria were able to assimilate acetate (23.Miller J.S. Allen M.M. Carbon utilization patterns in the heterotrophic blue-green alga Chlorogloea fritschii.Arch. Mikrobiol. 1972; 86: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 24.Hoare D. Hoare S. Moore R. The photoassimilation of organic compounds by autotrophic blue-green algae.J. Gen. Microbiol. 1967; 49: 351-370Crossref Google Scholar), a recent study in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 failed to detect the enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle (25.Knoop H. Gründel M. Zilliges Y. Lehmann R. Hoffmann S. Lockau W. Steuer R. Flux balance analysis of cyanobacterial metabolism: the metabolic network of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2013; 9: e1003081Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, a recent genome sequencing study reported that two Cyanothece spp. (strains PCC 7424 and PCC 7822) have an operon encoding the isocitrate lyase and malate synthase (26.Bandyopadhyay A. Elvitigala T. Welsh E. Stöckel J. Liberton M. Min H. Sherman L.A. Pakrasi H.B. Novel metabolic attributes of the genus Cyanothece, comprising a group of unicellular nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria.MBio. 2011; 2: e00214-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, this study did not demonstrate acetate utilization or the enzyme activities of the genes in question. Database searches showed that similar operons were also found in the genomes of two Chlorogloeopsis sp., strains, PCC 6912 and PCC 9212. Consistent with the presence of these two genes and thus the glyoxylate cycle in the Chlorogloeopsis spp., one of the organisms had been reported to assimilate acetate under both light and dark conditions (23.Miller J.S. Allen M.M. Carbon utilization patterns in the heterotrophic blue-green alga Chlorogloea fritschii.Arch. Mikrobiol. 1972; 86: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Further confusing the properties of the TCA and glyoxylate cycle enzymes in cyanobacteria, no gene encoding fumarase was initially identified in the annotation of the genome of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, although a fumarase was annotated in the genome of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. BLASTP searches showed that, among all the gene products in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, the product of the open reading frame of SYNPCC7002_A2041 had the highest sequence identity (43%) to the fumarase (slr0018) from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Although it had initially been misannotated as aspartate ammonia-lyase, it thus seemed likely that this gene encodes fumarase. In this study, we describe the biochemical validation of the predicted fumarase (SYNPCC7002_A2041) from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, as well as for two genes in Chlorogloeopsis fritschii PCC 9212 that encode the key enzymes, isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, of the glyoxylate cycle. We show that C. fritschii PCC 9212 can take up acetate under both light and dark conditions, and that the organism grows faster when acetate is supplied in the medium. Whole cell transcription profiling showed that the mRNA levels of these two genes increased when cells were grown with acetate. Furthermore, C. fritschii PCC 9212 cells accumulated much higher poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) levels when cells were supplied with acetate. This observation suggested that the extra carbon supplied as acetate was mainly stored as PHB. Additionally, when the genes for isocitrate lyase and malate synthase were overexpressed in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, this cyanobacterium exhibited an enhanced capacity for acetate uptake, confirming that the glyoxylate cycle can play an important role in acetate utilization even for an organism that normally lacks this capability. Overall, this study validates the existence of the glyxoxylate cycle in cyanobacteria but demonstrates that only a small number of cyanobacteria actually have this cycle. Our studies show that the glyoxylate cycle is not a common or prominent feature of cyanobacterial metabolism, but it may nevertheless be important for acetate utilization in those few organisms that have the enzymes of this pathway. C. fritschii PCC 9212 was obtained from the Pasteur Culture Collection (PCC) and routinely grown in medium BG-11 at 26 °C (27.Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. Generic assignments, strain histories and properties of pure cultures of cyanobacteria.J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar). To emphasize the effects of acetate supplementation, cells were grown under constant irradiance of 50 μmol photons m−2 s−1, which was provided by cool white fluorescent tubes, and cultures were sparged with 1% (v/v) CO2 in air (standard growth conditions). Low CO2 growth conditions were achieved by bubbling cultures with air while keeping all other growth conditions the same. When required, the growth medium was supplemented with 10 mm sodium acetate. The wild-type strain of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 as well as a strain overexpressing the genes of the glyoxylate cycle (strain Synechococcus 7002-glyox) were grown in liquid A+ medium under standard conditions for this organism (28.Ludwig M. Bryant D.A. Transcription profiling of the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 by Next-Gen (SOLiD) sequencing of cDNA.Front. Microbiol. 2011; 2: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar): cells were grown at an irradiance of 250 μmol photons m−2 s−1 provided by cool white fluorescent lights, at 38 °C and cultures were sparged with 1% (v/v) CO2 in air. Low irradiance or low CO2 growth conditions were produced by growing cells under 50 μmol photons m−2 s−1 or by sparging cultures with air under otherwise standard conditions. When required for experiments with Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, 10 mm sodium acetate was added to the A+ medium. The concentration of acetate in the medium at different growth stages was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In detail, aliquots (0.5 ml) of cell culture were removed from the growth medium at different growth stages. After centrifugation, the supernatant was filtered through 0.2-μm sterile syringe filter (VWR, Philadelphia, PA). A 20-μl aliquot of the filtered solution was loaded directly onto a Shimadzu LC-20AB HPLC system equipped with 210-nm UV detector SPD-20A. Different components in the medium were separated on a Supelcogel C610H column (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA), using 4 mm H2SO4 as the mobile phase. The flow rate was 0.5 ml min−1 and the chromatography was performed at 30 °C. Acetate concentrations were calculated on the basis of peak area using a standard curve generated from known concentrations of sodium acetate. Open reading frames SYNPCC7002_A2041, encoding the putative fumarase of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, UYEDRAFT_02681, encoding the putative isocitrate lyase and UYEDRAFT_02682, encoding the putative malate synthase of C. fritschii PCC 9212 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and separately cloned into plasmid pAQ1Ex-PcpcBA (29.Xu Y.

Primer set ICLF-ICLR was used to amplify UYEDRAFT_02681, primer set MSF-MSR was used to amplify UYEDRAFT_02682, and primer set FUMF-FUMR was used to amplify SYNPCC7002_A2041 (Table 1). An N-terminal His10 tag was introduced into isocitrate lyase and fumarase to facilitate subsequent protein purification. Initial attempts to add a His10 tag to the N terminus of malate synthase were not successful, and subsequently, a His6 tag was successfully added to the C terminus. The resulting plasmids pAQ1Ex-PcpcBA::A2041, pAQ1Ex-PcpcBA::U02681, and pAQ1Ex-PcpcBA::U02682 were verified by DNA sequencing and transformed into Escherichia coli strain DH5-α.

Cells were disrupted by three passages through a chilled French pressure cell operated at 138 MPa. Soluble lysates were obtained by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min and loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA affinity resin (Goldbio, St. Louis, MO), which was pre-equilibrated with 10 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and washed with 30 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl. Proteins were eluted stepwise with 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl. Fractions containing the recombinant proteins were monitored by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE) and concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centriprep columns (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Purified proteins were further analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with commercial antibodies (Rockland, Limerick, PA) to the poly-His tags.

For the conversion of malate to fumarate, the reaction mixture (0.2 ml) contained 10 mm malate, 50 mm K-phosphate, pH 7.0, and 50 μg of purified SynPCC7002_A2041. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and an aliquot (20 μl) of the reaction mixture was injected into the HPLC for analysis. For the conversion of fumarate to malate, the reaction mixture (0.2 ml) contained 2.5 mm fumarate, 50 mm K-phosphate, pH 7.0, and 50 μg of purified SynPCC7002_A2041. The assay mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and an aliquot (20 μl) of the reaction mixture was injected into the HPLC for analysis.

Open reading frames UYEDRAFT_02681 (isocitrate lyase) and UYEDRAFT_02682 (malate synthase) form an apparent operon in C. fritschii PCC 9212, and the entire operon was amplified by PCR and inserted into the pAQ1-based expression system (29.Xu Y.

Briefly, parallel liquid cultures (20 ml) of C. fritschii PCC 9212 were grown to different growth stages and at selected times, the cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The pellets were washed once with double-deionized water (20 ml). The resulting cell pellets were lyophilized to obtain dried cells. The dried cells and PHB standards (Sigma) were placed into glass tubes with sealed rubber caps. Chloroform (1 ml) and acidified methanol (15% v/v H2SO4) (1 ml) were added to each sample. The samples were heated in a 97 °C water bath for 3 h to convert the PHB into 3-hydroxybutyrate methyl ester. After methanolysis, double-deionized water (1 ml) was added to each sample. Following phase separation, the bottom chloroform phase (2 μl) was extracted and loaded directly onto a GC/MS for analysis as previously described (31.Tsang T.K. Roberson R.W. Vermaas W.F.

The concentrations and inferred cellular contents of PHB were calculated on the basis of a standard curve generated with known concentrations of PHB (Sigma). Global transcriptome profiling was performed by RNA-seq as previously described (33.Gan F. Zhang S. Rockwell N.C. Martin S.S. Lagarias J.C. Bryant D.A. Extensive remodeling of a cyanobacterial photosynthetic apparatus in far-red light.Science. 2014; 345: 1312-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The C. fritschii PCC 9212 was fully adapted to acetate growth conditions by serially subculturing cells three times in liquid BG-11 medium containing 10 mm acetate. The control strain was similarly grown three times on medium without acetate, and each culture was harvested at A750 nm = 1. Total RNA was then extracted from these two strains, and rRNA depletion was performed as described (33.Gan F. Zhang S. Rockwell N.C. Martin S.S. Lagarias J.C. Bryant D.A.

The construction of cDNA libraries and Illumina sequencing (50 nucleotides, single read) were performed in the Genomic Core Facility at The Pennsylvania State University. Mapping against the C. fritschii PCC 9212 genome was performed using the BWA software package, allowing a maximal 4 mismatches per read. The resulting alignment files were further analyzed with self-developed scripts to extract relative expression levels for each gene.

On the basis of magnetic field measurements during the descent and subsequent multiple touchdown of the Rosetta lander Philae on the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P), we show that no global magnetic field was detected within the limitations of analysis. The Rosetta Magnetometer and Plasma Monitor (ROMAP) suite of sensors measured an upper magnetic field magnitude of less than 2 nanotesla at the cometary surface at multiple locations, with the upper specific magnetic moment being <3.1 × 10(-5) ampere-square meters per kilogram for meter-size homogeneous magnetized boulders. The maximum dipole moment of 67P is 1.6 × 10(8) ampere-square meters. We conclude that on the meter scale, magnetic alignment in the preplanetary nebula is of minor importance."

Although twelve Populus 14-3-3s were identified based on the Populus trichocarpa genome V1.1 in a previous study, no systematic analysis including genome organization, gene structure, duplication relationship, evolutionary analysis and expression compendium has been conducted in Populus based on the latest P. trichocarpa genome V3.0.Here, a comprehensive analysis of Populus 14-3-3 family is presented. Two new 14-3-3 genes were identified based on the latest P. trichocarpa genome. In P. trichocarpa, fourteen 14-3-3 genes were grouped into ε and non-ε group. Exon-intron organizations of Populus 14-3-3s are highly conserved within the same group. Genomic organization analysis indicated that purifying selection plays a pivotal role in the retention and maintenance of Populus 14-3-3 family. Protein conformational analysis indicated that Populus 14-3-3 consists of a bundle of nine α-helices (α1-α9); the first four are essential for formation of the dimer, while α3, α5, α7, and α9 form a conserved peptide-binding groove. In addition, α1, α3, α5, α7, and α9 were evolving at a lower rate, while α2, α4, and α6 were evolving at a relatively faster rate. Microarray analyses showed that most Populus 14-3-3s are differentially expressed across tissues and upon exposure to various stresses.The gene structures and their coding protein structures of Populus 14-3-3s are highly conserved among group members, suggesting that members of the same group might also have conserved functions.

Previous studies suggested that Na+-binding reconfigures dynamically coupled structural elements in an allosteric interaction network (AIN) responsible for function-related conformational changes, but the intramolecular pathway of this mechanism has remained uncharted. We describe a new approach for the modeling and analysis of intramolecular dynamics in the bacterial NSS homolog LeuT. From microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations and cognate experimental verifications in both LeuT and human dopamine transporter (hDAT), we apply the novel method to identify the composition and the dynamic properties of their conserved AIN.

J. 2012; 103: 878-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the simulations, the manner in which the effects of Na+ binding in the Na1 and Na2 sites lead to the transitions among the states is observed to involve the reconfiguration of dynamically coupled structural motifs and microdomains. We refer to such a network of interactions that accomplishes the allosteric effect of rearrangements distal to the site of binding as an allosteric interaction network (AIN). The composition of such an AIN, as well as its dynamic properties and functional consequences, reflect the molecular mechanisms underlying transport in a rigorous framework (see also Ref. 15.LeVine M.V. Weinstein H. NbIT: a new information theory-based analysis of allosteric mechanisms reveals residues that underlie function in the leucine transporter LeuT.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2014; 10: e1003603Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that might be compared and generalized among various members of the NSS family. In seeking to develop such a framework in terms of a specific AIN, we reasoned that various perturbations of the interaction network underlying the functional mechanism could point to the disruptive pattern changes of the key interactions, and this would identify them as elements of the AIN. Moreover, the ensemble of local changes in AIN elements would point to the manner in which conformational propagation underlying the functional mechanism is achieved. We illustrate this approach to the identification and mechanistic evaluation of the AIN with the analysis of trajectories from microsecond-scale MD simulations using LeuT as the model system. As described here, these trajectories were analyzed to determine the relation and the connectivity between specific local perturbations and distal structural elements. The structural perturbations studied in this manner are (i) the substitution of Na+ by Li+ ions that do not support transport (16.Zhao Y. Terry D.S. Shi L. Quick M. Weinstein H. Blanchard S.C. Javitch J.A. Substrate-modulated gating dynamics in a Na+-coupled neurotransmitter transporter homologue.Nature. 2011; 474: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and (ii) the Y268A and R5A mutations at the intracellular gate, which were shown experimentally to have different consequences; although both R5A and Y268A mutation led to inward opening observed with single molecule FRET imaging, R5A did not significantly impair Ala transport but Y268A did (17.Zhao Y.

Single-molecule dynamics of gating in a neurotransmitter transporter homologue.Nature. 2010; 465: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The residues at the two positions (Tyr268 and Arg5) are in a cation-π interaction at the intracellular gate, but Arg5 also forms a salt bridge with Asp369. The new protocols we developed for the analysis described here were designed to quantitatively detect significant alterations in global conformations and identify local pairwise residue interactions associated with the perturbations in the large number of MD frames calculated for the various constructs. We show how this analysis allows us to deduce the identity and dynamics of the AIN in each case and to outline the association between Na+ binding and the configuration of the distal intracellular gate, which is ∼20 Å away from the Na+ binding sites. From the consonance of the computational findings with the results we present from experimental measurements used to probe the predicted allosteric impacts on Na+ binding (specifically, of the Y268A, R5A, and D369A mutations in LeuT and the corresponding Y335A, R60A, and D436A in DAT), we gain insight into the long range propagation of effects between Na+ binding and the intracellular gate. Based on our established simulation protocols and molecular system, we carried out the MD simulations of LeuT using NAMD (18.Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E.

Briefly, all-atom simulations of LeuT immersed in explicit 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine lipid bilayer were carried out with the CHARMM27-CMAP force field (19.MacKerell Jr., A.D.

In the isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble, constant temperature (310 K) was maintained with Langevin dynamics, and 1 atm constant pressure was achieved with the hybrid Nosé-Hoover Langevin piston method (20.Feller S.E. Zhang Y. Pastor R.W. Brooks B.R. Constant pressure molecular dynamics simulation: the Langevin piston method.J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103: 4613-4621Crossref Scopus (3297) Google Scholar) applied to an anisotropic flexible periodic cell, with orthogonal pressure components computed independently. The particle mesh Ewald method was used to evaluate long range electrostatic effects. A time step of 1 fs was used for the first 30 ns and was then increased to 2 fs for the rest of the simulation. All simulations were started from the substrate-bound crystal structure (PDB code 2A65) under the conditions listed in Table 1. In the names of the conditions, the wild type transporter is denoted as WT; the mutants are denoted as Y268A, R5A, and D369A; the presence of either Na+ or Li+ is denoted as Na or Li; the absence of any bound substrate is denoted as ns; and the presence of a substrate molecule in the S1 site is denoted as Leu or Ala. Thus, for example, “Y268A.Na.ns” represents the condition in the presence of the Y268A mutation and the bound Na+ ions but in the absence of any substrate.TABLE 1List of MD simulations performed for each conditionConditionNumber of replicasTotal simulation timensWT.Na.Leu2590WT.Na.Ala1360WT.Na.ns33600WT.Li.Leu1480WT.Li.Ala1480WT.Li.ns22400Y268A.Na.Leu1600Y268A.Na.ns34320R5A.Na.ns22640D369A.Na.ns32480Total1917,950 Open table in a new tab Analysis of the results from a total of ∼18 μs of simulations (Table 1) is based on a time resolution of 240 ps and uses consistent criteria applied across the entire data set to identify equilibrated trajectory segments. We used the following definitions of subsegments in LeuT: NT (N terminus, residues 1–9), TM1i (the intracellular section (i) of TM1, residues 10–19), TM1m (the middle section (m) of TM1, residues 20–27), TM1e (the extracellular section (e) of TM1, residues 28–37), EL1 (the extracellular loop 1, residues 38–40), TM2e (residues 41–46), TM2m (residues 47–56), TM2i (residues 57–70), IL1 (the intracellular loop 1, residues 71–87), TM3i (residues 88–103), TM3m (residues 104–108), TM3e (residues 109–124), EL2 (residues 125–165), TM4e (residues 166–174), TM4i (residues 175–183), IL2 (residues 184–190), TM5i (residues 191–200), TM5e (residues 201–213), EL3 (residues 214–240), TM6e (residues 241–249), TM6m (residues 250–261), TM6i (residues 262–268), IL3 (residues 269–275), TM7i (residues 276–285), TM7m (residues 286–292), TM7e (residues 293–306), EL4a (residues 307–319), EL4b (residues 320–336), TM8e (residues 337–350), TM8m (residues 351–359), TM8i (residues 360–369), IL4 (residues 370–374), TM9i (residues 375–384), TM9e (residues 385–395), EL5 (residues 396–398), TM10e (residues 399–406), TM10m (residues 407–411), TM10i (residues 412–424), IL5 (residues 425–446), TM11i (residues 447–469), TM11e (residues 470–477), EL6 (residues 478–482), TM12e (residues 483–492), and TM12i (residues 493–515). The volume of the extracellular vestibule (EV) was assessed by the number of water molecules in the EV (see Ref. 14.Zhao C. Stolzenberg S. Gracia L. Weinstein H. Noskov S. Shi L. Ion-controlled conformational dynamics in the outward-open transition from an occluded state of LeuT.Biophys. J. 2012; 103: 878-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar for more details). Distances and dihedral angles were computed with the VMD program (21.Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. VMD: visual molecular dynamics.J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (27–28): 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38728) Google Scholar). Pairwise residue interactions are calculated according to the residue contact defined previously (22.Venkatakrishnan A.J. Deupi X. Lebon G. Tate C.G. Schertler G.F. Babu M.M. Molecular signatures of G-protein-coupled receptors.Nature. 2013; 494: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) (i.e. if the distance between any two heavy atoms from two residues is smaller than the sum of their van der Waals radii plus 0.6 Å, these two residues are considered “in contact”). However, we exclude from this calculation contact pairs that are within 4 residues in sequence, because the van der Waals interactions between a residue and its immediate neighbors are not sensitive to conformational rearrangements. To detect changes of polar interactions within 4 residues (e.g. those forming backbone hydrogen bond interactions), we complement the “contact” results with those from the polar interactions computed with the HBPLUS program (23.McDonald I.K. Thornton J.M. Satisfying hydrogen bonding potential in proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar). A pairwise residue interaction is thus defined to exist if we can detect a contact or a polar interaction between this pair. We consider a pairwise residue interaction to be significantly different between two conditions a and b if the difference in their interaction frequencies is statistically significantly different from zero. Similar to our previous analysis for WT.Na.Leu and WT.Na.ns (14.Zhao C. Stolzenberg S. Gracia L. Weinstein H. Noskov S. Shi L. Ion-controlled conformational dynamics in the outward-open transition from an occluded state of LeuT.Biophys. J. 2012; 103: 878-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), several representative frames each from of WT.Na.ns.2 (5 frames) and Y268A.Na.ns (5 frames) trajectories were used as the starting conformations for the potential of mean force (PMF) computations. The frames were selected to represent the equilibrated stages in these trajectories that have minimum average root mean square deviations from the other frames. PMF profiles for Na+ binding to the Na1 and Na1′ sites from EC bulk were computed using the CHARMM program (24.Brooks B.R. Brooks 3rd, C.L. Mackerell Jr., A.D. Nilsson L. Petrella R.J. Roux B. Won Y. Archontis G. Bartels C. Boresch S. Caflisch A. Caves L. Cui Q. Dinner A.R. Feig M. Fischer S. Gao J. Hodoscek M. Im W. Kuczera K. Lazaridis T. Ma J. Ovchinnikov V. Paci E. Pastor R.W. Post C.B.

Chem. 2009; 30: 1545-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (5828) Google Scholar). The reaction coordinate for the profiles is the Cartesian coordinate z that is perpendicular to the lipid bilayer and pointing toward the extracellular side. A z value around 0 indicates the Na+ is bound to the Na1 site, whereas a high positive z value indicates the Na+ is approaching the EC bulk. Harmonic biasing potentials with a force constant of 10 kcal/(mol·Å2) were applied to 107 windows using the MMFP module in CHARMM for umbrella sampling. The window size was 0.25 Å, starting from −1.5 Å below the Na1 site to 25.0 Å above it. The production run of 2.0 ns of MD simulation was carried out using a time step of 2 fs for each window. The first 500 ps of the MD trajectories were used to seed the initial configuration (moving the Na1 ion to the window-specified constrained position) and equilibration. The seeding procedure placed the ion in a wide range of positions within the extracellular vestibule, enabling sufficient sampling along the reaction coordinate (14.Zhao C. Stolzenberg S. Gracia L.

J. 2012; 103: 878-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A flat bottom cylindrical restraint with r = 15 Å was used to confine ion dynamics in the xy plane along the reaction coordinate. The weighted histogram method (WHAM) was then used to obtain the PMFs from the 1.5 ns samples from each window. 6A. Grossfield, WHAM: the weighted histogram analysis method, version 2.0.6. The S.E. values of the PMFs were computed by blocking the data into three blocks for each independent run. The errors are within ±1–1.5 kcal/mol, depending on the system. LeuT-WT, -R5A, -Y268A, and -D369A were produced and purified as described (2.Shi L. Quick M. Zhao Y. Weinstein H. Javitch J.A.

Scintillation proximity assay-based binding of [3H]leucine (140 Ci/mmol; Moravek) to purified LeuT variants was performed with 0.8 pmol of purified protein per assay in 50 mm Tris/Mes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 0.1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β,d-maltopyranoside, and 20% glycerol. The NaCl concentration dependence of binding of [3H]Leu or 1.92 μm [22Na]Cl (5.92 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to the indicated LeuT constructs was measured with the scintillation proximity assay after desalting the protein samples (with ZebaTM desalt spin columns; Pierce) in assay buffer composed of 100–600 mm Tris/Mes, pH 7.5 (equimolarly replaced with 0–500 mm NaCl), 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 0.1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β,d-maltopyranoside, and 20% glycerol. Purified LeuT variants were reconstituted at a 1:150 (w/w) ratio in preformed liposomes made of Escherichia coli polar lipid extract (Avanti) as described (27.Quick M. Shi L. Zehnpfennig B. Weinstein H. Javitch J.A. Experimental conditions can obscure the second high-affinity site in LeuT.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). 1 μm [3H]Ala (49.4 Ci/mmol; Moravek) transport was measured for the indicated periods of time at 22 °C in assay buffer composed of 50 mm Tris/Mes, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl and stopped by quenching the samples with ice-cold assay buffer followed by rapid filtration through 0.22-μm nitrocellulose filters (Millipore) and scintillation counting. Counts/min were transformed into mol using known amounts of [3H]Ala. Protein used for binding experiments or that was incorporated into proteoliposomes was determined with the Amido Black protein assay (28.Schaffner W. Weissmann C. A rapid, sensitive, and specific method for the determination of protein in dilute solution.Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar). For the expression and experimental assessment of Na+ dependence in DAT, all experiments were performed on intact COS7 cells transiently expressing DAT-WT, -R60A, -Y335A, or -D436A. Cell handling, molecular biology, transfection, and assessment of the apparent affinity for dopamine (DA) uptake were performed essentially as described previously (29.Loland C.J. Grånäs C. Javitch J.A. Gether U. Identification of intracellular residues in the dopamine transporter critical for regulation of transporter conformation and cocaine binding.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3228-3238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, to assess the apparent affinity for DA uptake, experiments were performed 2 days after transfection in uptake buffer (25 mm HEPES, 130 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm l-ascorbic acid, 5 mm d-glucose, and a 1 μm concentration of the catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor Ro 41-0960 (Sigma), pH 7.4) using 3,4-[ring-2,5,6–3H]dihydroxyphenylethylamine ([3H]DA) (30–60 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Prior to the addition of ([3H]DA), cells were added a concentration of unlabeled DA from 1 nm to 1 mm in 10 consecutive concentrations. Nonspecific uptake was determined using 1 μm nomifensine. At t = 0, uptake was initiated by the addition of 6 nm [3H]DA. The cells expressing DAT-WT or DAT-D436A were incubated for 5 min, whereas 10-min incubation was used for DAT-R60A and -Y335A, to achieve an uptake level of no more than 10% of total added [3H]DA. For assessment of the Na+ dependence, the NaCl in the uptake buffer was substituted with choline chloride to achieve the following Na+ concentrations: 0, 1, 5, 7.5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 75, 100, 130 and 200 mm. At t = 0, 1 μm [3H]DA was added (specific activity: 1.35 Ci/mmol), and the cells were incubated for 5 min for WT, 15 min for D436A, and 30 min for R60A and Y335A. Background levels for each Na+ concentration and [3H]DA incubation time were determined by experiments performed in parallel using cells transfected with non-coding plasmid, and the background readout was subtracted from the total uptake. All concentrations are performed in triplicate. Samples were transferred to 24-well counting plates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), to which Opti-phase Hi Safe 3 scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added prior to counting in a Wallac Tri-Lux β-scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Uptake data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). The microsecond-scale MD simulations started from the crystal structure of LeuT in the occluded state (PDB code 2A65) are listed in Table 1. The trajectories were analyzed to identify the mechanistic elements that mediate the impact of perturbations introduced by (i) the presence of Li+ (instead of the physiological coupling cation Na+) (16.Zhao Y. Terry D.S. Shi L. Quick M. Weinstein H. Blanchard S.C. Javitch J.A. Substrate-modulated gating dynamics in a Na+-coupled neurotransmitter transporter homologue.Nature. 2011; 474: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) or by (ii) the Y268A, R5A, or D369A mutation at the intracellular gate (17.Zhao Y. Terry D. Shi L. Weinstein H. Blanchard S.C. Javitch J.A. Single-molecule dynamics of gating in a neurotransmitter transporter homologue.Nature. 2010; 465: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Analysis of the trajectories for LeuT with bound Na+ but not substrate (denoted as WT.Na.ns; see “Experimental Procedures” and Table 1) had shown that LeuT transitions spontaneously from the occluded conformation to an outward-open conformation (14.Zhao C. Stolzenberg S. Gracia L. Weinstein H. Noskov S. Shi L. Ion-controlled conformational dynamics in the outward-open transition from an occluded state of LeuT.Biophys.

Here we simulated LeuT similarly in the absence of substrate but subjected it to various perturbations: either Li+ binding (replacing Na+), denoted as WT.Li.ns, or the mutation Y268A, R5A, or D369A identified as Y268A.Na.ns, R5A.Na.ns, or D369A.Na.ns, respectively.

These nAChRs exist in several stoichiometries, typically with two high affinity acetylcholine (ACh) binding sites at the interface of α4 and β2 subunits and a fifth accessory subunit. A third low affinity ACh binding site is formed when this accessory subunit is α4 but not if it is β2. Agonists selective for the accessory ACh site, such as 3-[3-(3-pyridyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl]benzonitrile (NS9283), cannot alone activate a nAChR but can facilitate more efficient activation in combination with agonists at the canonical α4β2 sites.

We expressed (α4β2)2 concatamers in Xenopus oocytes with free accessory subunits to obtain defined nAChR stoichiometries and α4/accessory subunit interfaces. We show that α2, α3, α4, and α6 accessory subunits can form binding sites for ACh and NS9283 at interfaces with α4 subunits, but β2 and β4 accessory subunits cannot.

Background: In (α4β2)2α4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, there is an agonist binding site at the α4/α4 subunit interface. Results: α2, α3, and α6 accessory subunits can form an agonist site with α4. These promote activation upon agonist binding at α4/β2 agonist sites. Conclusion: Accessory subunit agonist sites greatly influence receptor function. Significance: These sites are promising drug targets."

Previous studies demonstrated that an amitriptyline-evoked matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)/FGF receptor (FGFR)/FGFR substrate 2α (FRS2α)/ERK cascade is crucial for GDNF production, but how amitriptyline triggers this cascade remains unknown. MMP is activated by intracellular mediators such as G proteins, and this study sought to clarify the involvement of G protein signaling in amitriptyline-evoked GDNF production in rat C6 astroglial cells (C6 cells), primary cultured rat astrocytes, and normal human astrocytes. Amitriptyline-evoked GDNF mRNA expression and release were inhibited by pertussis toxin (PTX), a Gαi/o inhibitor, but not by NF449, a Gαs inhibitor, or YM-254890, a Gαq inhibitor. The activation of the GDNF production cascade (FGFR/FRS2α/ERK) was also inhibited by PTX. Deletion of Gαο1 and Gαi3 by RNAi demonstrated that these G proteins play important roles in amitriptyline signaling. G protein activation was directly analyzed by electrical impedance-based biosensors (CellKeyTM assay), using a label-free (without use of fluorescent proteins/probes or radioisotopes) and real time approach. Amitriptyline increased impedance, indicating Gαi/o activation that was suppressed by PTX treatment. The impedance evoked by amitriptyline was not affected by inhibitors of the GDNF production cascade. Furthermore, FGF2 treatment did not elicit any effect on impedance, indicating that amitriptyline targets PTX-sensitive Gαi/o upstream of the MMP/FGFR/FRS2α/ERK cascade.

Non-bulky small base lesions, derived from deamination, alkylation, or oxidation, are excised and replaced in the base excision repair pathway. The first enzymatic step in the base excision repair pathway is typically the excision of the substrate base from duplex DNA by a DNA glycosylase, one of the enzymes that catalyze the cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond between the substrate base and the 2′-deoxyribose, creating an abasic (AP) site. 5,6-dihydrouracil 2-aminopurine 1,3-diaza-2-oxophenoxazine (3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methyl phosphate human 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase helix-hairpin-helix endonuclease III.

The former is the nucleophile that attacks the C1′ atom of deoxyribose, resulting in the cleavage of the N-glycosydic bond and subsequent formation of a Schiff base covalent intermediate (Fig. 1, step 1). The following β-elimination reaction leads to the departure of the 3′-phosphate. The subsequent Schiff base hydrolysis releases the enzyme and leads to formation of a single-strand break in DNA duplex with an α-β-unsaturated aldehyde at the 3′-end and a phosphate at the 5′-end (Fig. 1, step 2). The x-ray structures of free Endo III from E. coli as well as three complexes of Endo III from Geobacillus stearothermophilus with DNA have been published (14.Thayer M.M. Ahern H. Xing D.

The overall structure of enzyme shows two similarly sized globular domains separated by a deep DNA-binding groove that contains the active site cavity (Fig. 2). Endo III binding induces gross conformational changes in DNA, in which the helix axis is bent ∼55° and the damaged nucleotide is everted to the active site of the enzyme. Although the three-dimensional structure of the Endo III-DNA complex is established, it tells us little about the mechanism of substrate recognition by this enzyme, because the DNA in the structures contains no damaged base. The overall mode of interaction of Endo III with DNA is very similar to that seen with other members of the HhH-GPD structural superfamily, making it possible to compare the kinetic and conformational features of DNA binding and damage recognition with other well studied members of this superfamily (16.Denver D.R.

It was concluded (20.Kuznetsova A.A. Kuznetsov N.A. Ishchenko A.A. Saparbaev M.K. Fedorova O.S. Step-by-step mechanism of DNA damage recognition by human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase.Biochim.

These interactions lead to DNA distortion and eversion of the oxoG base from DNA to the intermediate base-binding site (exo-site) of the enzyme. A thermodynamic analysis (21.Kuznetsov N.A. Kuznetsova A.A. Vorobjev Y.N. Krasnoperov L.N. Fedorova O.S. Thermodynamics of the DNA damage repair steps of human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase.PloS One. 2014; 9: e98495Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) argues that the initial step of the DNA substrate binding is mainly governed by a negative enthalpy change due to the formation of favorable contacts between hOGG1 and DNA, as well as due to the partial desolvation of the interface resulting in positive entropy change. The oxoG base is then fully placed into the active site and forms specific interactions within the base recognition pocket detected in the structure of the pre-catalytic hOGG1-DNA complex (22.Bruner S.D. Norman D.P. Verdine G.L. Structural basis for recognition and repair of the endogenous mutagen 8-oxoguanine in DNA.Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). In addition, Asn149 (corresponding to Gln42 in G. stearothermophilus Endo III, Fig. 3B) forms a hydrogen bond between the amide carbonyl of its side chain and the amino group of the opposite cytosine. Interestingly, hOGG1 can also guide the undamaged G base through the exo-site into the active site, albeit less efficiently, but cannot cleave its N-glycosidic bond indicating strong discrimination selectivity between damaged and undamaged DNA (23.Banerjee A.

Fedorova O.S. Thermodynamics of the DNA damage repair steps of human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase.PloS One. 2014; 9: e98495Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) reveals that the discrimination of nonspecific G base versus specific oxoG base mostly occurs at the second step of the DNA binding. At the last pre-catalytic step the enzyme-substrate complex is finally adjusted to a catalytically competent conformation. This process is characterized by large endothermicity compensated by a significant increase in entropy likely originating from dehydration of the DNA grooves. Here we present a kinetic analysis of conformational changes in DNA with another DNA glycosylase from the HhH-GPD structural superfamily, E. coli Endo III. Two fluorescent reporters, 2-aminopurine (aPu) placed 3′ to the damaged nucleotide and tCO placed opposite to the lesion were chosen for detection of DNA dynamics. Dodecamer oligodeoxyribonucleotide duplexes contained centrally placed specific lesions: dHU, the natural AP site and its uncleavable analogue (3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methyl phosphate (F) or undamaged nucleotide. The substrates containing dHU are subject to the full enzymatic cycle, which includes DNA binding, N-glycosidic bond cleavage, β-elimination, and product release. The substrates containing an AP site are limited to β-elimination and product release. The undamaged DNA duplexes and duplexes containing F reveal the conformational changes in DNA during binding with Endo III uncomplicated by catalytic steps. A comparison of fluorescence kinetic data with available structures for Endo III allowed us to propose the mechanism of Endo III interaction with specific and nonspecific sites.

The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 30 ml of the lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 40 mm NaCl), and lysed using a French press. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant was passed through a Q-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) in the same buffer but containing 250 mm NaCl. The eluate was diluted 2-fold by 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8) and loaded into a heparin column (GE Healthcare). Endo III was eluted using a 100–1500 mm NaCl gradient in 20 mm HEPES-KOH. The fractions containing Endo III were collected, glycerol was added to 50%, and the samples were stored at −20 °C. The sequences of oligodeoxyribonucleotides used in this work are listed in Table 1. The oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized by the standard phosphoramidite method using an ASM-700 synthesizer (BIOSSET, Novosibirsk, Russia) in the ICBFM Laboratory of Bionanotechnology.

All experiments were carried out at 25 °C in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 7% glycerol (v/v). An SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrometer (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK) fitted with a 150-W Xe arc lamp was used. The dead time of the instrument was 1.4 ms. The excitation wavelengths were 310 and 360 nm for the aPu and tCO fluorescent dyes, respectively. The emission was monitored using long pass wavelength filters (Corion) at 370 nm for aPu and 395 nm for tCO. Endo III was placed in one syringe of instrument and rapidly mixed with the substrate in another syringe. The concentration of substrates in all experiments was 1.0 μm, and the concentration of Endo III was varied in the 0.5–4.0 μm range. The reported concentrations of reactants are those in the reaction chamber after mixing. Typically, each trace shown is the average of four or more individual experiments; the reported rate constants represent the mean ± S.D. of such data sets. In the figures, the individual traces are manually offset for clarity. The kinetic parameters were obtained by global non-linear fitting using the DynaFit software (BioKin, Pullman, WA) (30.Kuzmic P.

The approach is based on the fluorescence intensity variation in the course of the reaction due to sequential formation and further transformation of the DNA-enzyme complex and its conformers. The software performs numerical integration of a system of differential equations with subsequent non-linear least-squares regression analysis. The response factors of the intermediates (that are essentially the products of the fluorescence quantum yields) are treated as fitting parameters in the data processing. In the evaluated mechanisms, except for the first bimolecular step, all other reactions are first order reactions. In the data processing, the kinetic information is obtained from the “temporal behavior” of the fluorescence intensity, not from the “amplitudes” of the specific signal contributions. The “response factors” for different conformers resulting from the fits were not used in the determination of the equilibrium constants, but rather provided additional information on the fluorescence intensity variations in different complexes and conformers. Processing of individual kinetic curves does not unambiguously provide the kinetic parameters; therefore, global fits of sets of kinetic curves obtained at different concentrations of the reactants was used. The fits of all relevant rate constants for the forward and reverse reactions, as well as the specific molar responses for all intermediate complexes, were optimized. After that rate constants for the forward and reverse reactions were fixed and additional optimization of the specific molar responses of intermediate complexes for individual kinetic traces was done. To analyze the products formed by Endo III, the substrates were 5′-32P labeled using phage T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and the reaction was performed under the conditions described above. The products were precipitated by adding 10 volumes of 2% LiClO4 in acetone. The precipitates were washed three times with 100 μl of acetone, dried, dissolved in 4 μl of water and 3 μl of loading buffer (80% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), and analyzed by 20% denaturing PAGE. To observe formation of the AP site after base excision, the reaction mixture was treated with 0.3 m NaOH and heated for 15 min at 75 °C to cleave the DNA backbone at AP sites. The gels were visualized using Agfa CP-BU x-ray film (Agfa-Geavert, Mortsel, Belgium), and the autoradiograms were scanned and quantified using Gel-Pro Analyzer software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD). The time course curves of product accumulation were fitted by a single exponential function using Origin software (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA) (Equation 1), [roduct]=A×[1−exp(−Kobst)](Eq. 1) where A is the amplitude, kobs is the rate constant, and t is the reaction time. The most informative approach to follow conformational transitions occurring in protein-DNA interactions through fluorescence changes involves a combination of the intrinsic protein fluorescence from tryptophan residues and DNA fluorescence from incorporated reporters. However, we were unable to detect changes in Endo III fluorescence in the reactions with any ligand or substrate, which is most likely due to suboptimal location of Trp residues or lack of significant conformation mobility in the protein molecule. Thus we have resorted to a set of fluorescent reporters to follow DNA dynamics in the complex. The fluorescent analogs of DNA bases aPu (20.Kuznetsova A.A. Kuznetsov N.A. Ishchenko A.A.

https://openalex.org/W2049757457,"Background Fungal spores and plant pollen cause respiratory diseases in susceptible individuals, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Aeroallergen monitoring networks are an important part of treatment strategies, but unfortunately traditional analysis is time consuming and expensive. We have explored the use of infrared spectroscopy of pollen and spores for an inexpensive and rapid characterization of aeroallergens. Methodology The study is based on measurement of spore and pollen samples by single reflectance attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (SR-ATR FTIR). The experimental set includes 71 spore (Basidiomycota) and 121 pollen (Pinales, Fagales and Poales) samples. Along with fresh basidiospores, the study has been conducted on the archived samples collected within the last 50 years. Results The spectroscopic-based methodology enables clear spectral differentiation between pollen and spores, as well as the separation of confamiliar and congeneric species. In addition, the analysis of the scattering signals inherent in the infrared spectra indicates that the FTIR methodology offers indirect estimation of morphology of pollen and spores. The analysis of fresh and archived spores shows that chemical composition of spores is well preserved even after decades of storage, including the characteristic taxonomy-related signals. Therefore, biochemical analysis of fungal spores by FTIR could provide economical, reliable and timely methodologies for improving fungal taxonomy, as well as for fungal identification and monitoring. This proof of principle study shows the potential for using FTIR as a rapid tool in aeroallergen studies. In addition, the presented method is ready to be immediately implemented in biological and ecological studies for direct measurement of pollen and spores from flowers and sporocarps."
https://openalex.org/W2019299314,"Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that develops early and its severity increases as renal function declines. It is mainly due to a reduced production of erythropoietin (EPO) by the kidneys; however, there are evidences that iron metabolism disturbances increase as CKD progresses. Our aim was to study the mechanisms underlying the development of anemia of CKD, as well as renal damage, in the remnant kidney rat model of CKD induced by 5/6 nephrectomy. This model of CKD presented a sustained degree of renal dysfunction, with mild and advanced glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions. Anemia developed 3 weeks after nephrectomy and persisted throughout the protocol. The remnant kidney was still able to produce EPO and the liver showed an increased EPO gene expression. In spite of the increased EPO blood levels, anemia persisted and was linked to low serum iron and transferrin levels, while serum interleukin (IL)-6 and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels showed the absence of systemic inflammation. The increased expression of duodenal ferroportin favours iron absorption; however, serum iron is reduced which might be due to iron leakage through advanced kidney lesions, as showed by tubular iron accumulation. Our data suggest that the persistence of anemia may result from disturbances in iron metabolism and by an altered activity/function of EPO as a result of kidney cell damage and a local inflammatory milieu, as showed by the increased gene expression of different inflammatory proteins in the remnant kidney. In addition, this anemia and the associated kidney hypoxia favour the development of fibrosis, angiogenesis and inflammation that may underlie a resistance to EPO stimuli and reduced iron availability. These findings might contribute to open new windows to identify putative therapeutic targets for this condition, as well as for recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO) resistance, which occurs in a considerable percentage of CKD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2076526241,"Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) polysaccharides have been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, and alterations in their amount and structure have been associated with diseases such as cancer. In this study, we probed 11 sugar analogs for their capacity to interfere with GAG biosynthesis. One analog, with a modification not directly involved in the glycosidic bond formation, 6F-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (Ga***lNAc) (Ac3), was selected for further study on its metabolic and biologic effect. Treatment of human ovarian carcinoma cells with 50 μM 6F-GalNAc (Ac3) inhibited biosynthesis of GAGs (chondroitin/dermatan sulfate by ~50-60%, heparan sulfate by ~35%), N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc)/GalNAc containing glycans recognized by the lectins Datura stramonium and peanut agglutinin (by ~74 and ~43%, respectively), and O-GlcNAc protein modification. With respect to function, 6F-GalNAc (Ac3) treatment inhibited growth factor signaling and reduced in vivo angiogenesis by ~33%. Although the analog was readily transformed in cells into the uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP)-activated form, it was not incorporated into GAGs. Rather, it strongly reduced cellular UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcNAc pools. Together with data from the literature, these findings indicate that nucleotide sugar depletion without incorporation is a common mechanism of sugar analogs for inhibiting GAG/glycan biosynthesis.—Van Wijk, X.

https://openalex.org/W1768355854,"Zinc is an essential trace element that participates in a wide range of biological functions, including wound healing. Although Zn(2+) deficiency has been linked to compromised wound healing and tissue repair in human diseases, the molecular mechanisms underlying Zn(2+)-mediated tissue repair remain unknown. Our previous studies established that MG53, a TRIM (tripartite motif) family protein, is an essential component of the cell membrane repair machinery. Domain homology analysis revealed that MG53 contains two Zn(2+)-binding motifs. Here, we show that Zn(2+) binding to MG53 is indispensable to assembly of the cell membrane repair machinery. Live cell imaging illustrated that Zn(2+) entry from extracellular space is essential for translocation of MG53-containing vesicles to the acute membrane injury sites for formation of a repair patch. The effect of Zn(2+) on membrane repair is abolished in mg53(-/-) muscle fibers, suggesting that MG53 functions as a potential target for Zn(2+) during membrane repair. Mutagenesis studies suggested that both RING and B-box motifs of MG53 constitute Zn(2+)-binding domains that contribute to MG53-mediated membrane repair. Overall, this study establishes a base for Zn(2+) interaction with MG53 in protection against injury to the cell membrane."

The platelet parameters and (1, 3)-β-D-Glucan (BG) may be useful for diagnosing IFD, but their diagnostic performance are not well characterized in neonates. We studied 63 preterm infants with IFD, 160 preterm infants without sepsis (preterm control), and 41 preterm infants with bacterial sepsis. Platelet parameters at the first day of onset of IFD and at the fourteenth day after antifungal treatment were evaluated. Serum BG was measured. Platelet count (PC), plateletcrit (PCT), and platelet distribution width (PDW) values were significantly lower, and mean platelet volume (MPV) values significantly higher in the IFD versus preterm control infants. PC and PCT values were much lower in infants with IFD versus bacterial sepsis, and there were significant differences in BG value between the two groups. After 14 days of antifungal treatment, significant elevations in PC, PCT, PDW and reductions in MPV levels in IFD group were observed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed that PC and PCT were strong predictors of IFD. The PC and PCT cut-offs for predicting IFD were 119.5 (sensitivity 78%, specificity 95%) and 0.21 (sensitivity 83%, specificity 85%), respectively. There were significant differences in PC and PCT levels between deceased and survived patients. The PC and PCT cut-offs for predicting deceased IFD were 39 (sensitivity 62%, specificity 86%) and 0.04 (sensitivity 50%, specificity 95%), respectively. The sensitivity in diagnosing IFD by a BG cutoff of ≥10pg/ml was 68.3% and specificity was 75.6%. PC and PCT levels in the BG ≥400 pg/ml group were significantly lower compared to the BG<400 pg/ml group. Platelet parameters and BG could be useful biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of neonatal IFD."
https://openalex.org/W1965783435,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze ATP-dependent covalent coupling of cognate amino acids and tRNAs for ribosomal protein synthesis. Escherichia coli isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) exploits both the tRNA-dependent pre- and post-transfer editing pathways to minimize errors in translation. However, the molecular mechanisms by which tRNAIle organizes the synthetic site to enhance pre-transfer editing, an idiosyncratic feature of IleRS, remains elusive. Here we show that tRNAIle affects both the synthetic and editing reactions localized within the IleRS synthetic site. In a complex with cognate tRNA, IleRS exhibits a 10-fold faster aminoacyl-AMP hydrolysis and a 10-fold drop in amino acid affinity relative to the free enzyme. Remarkably, the specificity against non-cognate valine was not improved by the presence of tRNA in either of these processes. Instead, amino acid specificity is determined by the protein component per se, whereas the tRNA promotes catalytic performance of the synthetic site, bringing about less error-prone and kinetically optimized isoleucyl-tRNAIle synthesis under cellular conditions. Finally, the extent to which tRNAIle modulates activation and pre-transfer editing is independent of the intactness of its 3′-end. This finding decouples aminoacylation and pre-transfer editing within the IleRS synthetic site and further demonstrates that the A76 hydroxyl groups participate in post-transfer editing only. The data are consistent with a model whereby the 3′-end of the tRNA remains free to sample different positions within the IleRS·tRNA complex, whereas the fine-tuning of the synthetic site is attained via conformational rearrangement of the enzyme through the interactions with the remaining parts of the tRNA body.Background: Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase uses cognate tRNA to stimulate hydrolysis of non-cognate aminoacyl-adenylates within the synthetic site.Results: The 3′-terminal hydroxyl groups of tRNAIle have no role in pre-transfer editing.Conclusion: The tRNAIle body, rather than the 3′-end of tRNAIle alone, promotes assembly of the improved ribonuclear protein synthetic site.Significance: Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase acts as a ribonuclear protein to adjust amino acid recognition to the cellular environment.

Factors affecting ACV formation and release remain poorly characterized; although in some cell types, the generation of extracellular vesicles is associated with up-regulation of autophagy. We sought to determine the role of autophagy in ACV production by primary articular chondrocytes. Using an innovative dynamic model with a light scatter nanoparticle counting apparatus, we determined the effects of autophagy modulators on ACV number and content in conditioned medium from normal adult porcine and human osteoarthritic chondrocytes. Healthy articular chondrocytes release ACVs into conditioned medium and show significant levels of ongoing autophagy. Rapamycin, which promotes autophagy, increased ACV numbers in a dose- and time-dependent manner associated with increased levels of autophagy markers and autophagosome formation. These effects were suppressed by pharmacologic autophagy inhibitors and short interfering RNA for ATG5. Caspase-3 inhibition and a Rho/ROCK inhibitor prevented rapamycin-induced increases in ACV number. Osteoarthritic chondrocytes, which are deficient in autophagy, did not increase ACV number in response to rapamycin.

Proinflammatory cytokine TNFα increased CREBH expression by up-regulating the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway in osteoblasts, increased the level of N-terminal fragment of CREBH in the nucleus, and inhibited BMP2 induction of osteoblast specific gene expression.

OASIS and ATF6 are structurally similar to CREBH; these three proteins belong to the ER membrane-bound bZIP transcription factor family and are collectively referred to as OASIS family members (12Lee M.W. Chanda D. Yang J. Oh H. Kim S.S. Yoon Y.S. Hong S. Park K.G. Lee I.K. Choi C.S. Hanson R.W. Choi H.S. Koo S.H. Regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis by an ER-bound transcription factor, CREBH.Cell Metab. 2010; 11: 331-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which CREBH and ATF6 sense unfolded proteins and translocate from the ER to the Golgi differ from those of other OASIS family members (13Saito A. Physiological functions of endoplasmic reticulum stress transducer OASIS in central nervous system.Anat. Sci. Int. 2014; 89: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, OASIS family members have distinct expression patterns, suggesting that these transcription factors may be associated with cell- or tissue-specific physiological responses. CREBH is induced and activated by the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-6, and LPS (14Gentile C.L. Wang D. Pfaffenbach K.T. Cox R. Wei Y. Pagliassotti M.J. Fatty acids regulate CREBh via transcriptional mechanisms that are dependent on proteasome activity and insulin.Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2010; 344: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Hence, it integrates the proinflammatory response and regulation of ER stress, thereby underlining its importance to inflammatory responses. Although these transcriptional factors have a structural similarity, they can produce an opposite effect on biological systems. In glucose metabolism, CREBH promotes gluconeogenic activity in a CRTC2-independent manner (15Lee A.H. The role of CREB-H transcription factor in triglyceride metabolism.Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2012; 23: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and ATF6 inhibits hepatic glucose output by competing with CREB for interaction with CRTC2 (16Wang Y. Vera L. Fischer W.H. Montminy M. The CREB coactivator CRTC2 links hepatic ER stress and fasting gluconeogenesis.Nature. 2009; 460: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Inflammatory cytokines inhibit BMP-induced osteogenesis and bone formation (17Gilbert L. He X. Farmer P. Boden S. Kozlowski M. Rubin J. Nanes M.S.

Tumor necrosis factor-α: molecular and cellular mechanisms in skeletal pathology.Gene. 2003; 321: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar); in fact, TNFα is a major inflammatory mediator responsible for bone loss in a number of bone-related inflammatory diseases (19Choy E.H.

TNFα inhibits BMP signaling by interfering with the DNA-binding ability of Smads via activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, regulating Runx2 expression, and inhibiting BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation (18Nanes M.S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 2695-2701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In addition, TNFα induces the expression of Smad7 and Msx2, which also inhibit BMP signaling and related osteogenesis (23Lee H.L. Yi T. Woo K.M. Ryoo H.M. Kim G.S. Baek J.H. Msx2 mediates the inhibitory action of TNF-α on osteoblast differentiation.Exp. Mol. Med. 2010; 42: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Yan X. Chen Y.G. Smad7: not only a regulator, but also a cross-talk mediator of TGF-β signalling.Biochem. J. 2011; 434: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Activation of ERK by TNFα results in inhibition of the transcription factor osterix, and TNFα-mediated induction of Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1) and Smurf2 accelerates the degradation of Runx2 protein through the proteasomal degradation pathway (25Kaneki H. Guo R. Chen D. Yao Z. Schwarz E.M. Zhang Y.E. Boyce B.F. Xing L. Tumor necrosis factor promotes Runx2 degradation through up-regulation of Smurf1 and Smurf2 in osteoblasts.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4326-4333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Despite these findings, the molecular mechanisms underlying inflammatory actions in osteoblast differentiation are not fully understood. Here, we examined the effect of CREBH on osteoblast differentiation in vitro and ectopic and orthotopic bone formation in vivo. The results indicate that CREBH functions as a modulator of TNFα-mediated inhibition of osteogenesis, and that this action is mediated mainly by Smurf1-induced degradation of Smad1. Overall, we describe a novel signaling pathway that encourages further analyses of the relationship between ER stress and bone formation. Recombinant human BMP2 was obtained from Cowellmedi Co. (Busan, Korea) and TNFα was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). BAY11-7082, an inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK), was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth, PA). Antibodies against Runx2 and β-actin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-CREBH antibody was described previously (12Lee M.W. Chanda D. Yang J. Oh H. Kim S.S. Yoon Y.S.

Res. 2010; 25: 262-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (Gibco-BRL, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; GIBCO-BRL) and antibiotics, and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Transient transfections were performed as described previously (28Jang W.G. Kim E.J. Lee K.N. Son H.J. Koh J.T. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) positively regulates osteoblast differentiation via induction of Dlx5-dependent Runx2 expression in MC3T3E1 cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

For viral infection, the cells were treated with the indicated viruses at the designated multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) under serum-free conditions. After 4 h, the medium was replaced with an equivalent volume of medium containing 10% FBS, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24–48 h. Total RNA was isolated from the cultured cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed using 1 μg of total RNA. For quantification of gene transcription, cDNA was generated with the Maxime RT PreMix Kit (iNtRon, Sungnam, Korea), and then amplified on the StepOnePlus Real-time PCR System (ABI, Abilene, TX) using the QuantiTect SYBR PCR Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and specific primers. Cycling conditions were 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 30 s. Post-run samples were analyzed using ABI software and the relative expression was quantified using the 2−ΔΔCt method with endogenous β-actin levels. The primer sequences have been described previously (29Jang W.G. Kim E.J. Koh J.T. Tunicamycin negatively regulates BMP2-induced osteoblast differentiation through CREBH expression in MC3T3E1 cells.BMB Rep. 2011; 44: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Total cells or nuclear fractions were harvested in lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Cambridge, MA) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit (Pierce Biotechnology), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantification of total protein was performed using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). Proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. After blocking using Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% milk, the membrane was incubated with specific primary antibodies. Signals were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Densitometric analysis of the membrane was performed using a LAS-4000 lumino-image analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with TNFα for the designated times and ChIP assays were performed as described previously (30Lee Y.S. Kim D.K. Kim Y.D. Park K.C. Shong M. Seong H.A. Ha H.J. Choi H.S. Orphan nuclear receptor SHP interacts with and represses hepatocyte nuclear factor-6 (HNF-6) transactivation.Biochem. J. 2008; 413: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The DNA samples were quantified by qPCR using two pairs of primers. The primer sequences for the p50 and p65 binding regions of the CREBH promoter were 5′-CCAACTCTCAAGAATCAGTCAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTTTGCATCTGTGACAGGATG-3′ (reverse). The control primer sequences were 5′-GTTCTTGCATAGACCAGGCCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGCCTGGTCTATGCAAGAAC-3′ (reverse). For quantitative comparison with qPCR, the ΔCT method was applied. A ΔCT value was calculated by subtracting the CT value of the input from that of the immunoprecipitated sample. A ΔΔCT value was then obtained by subtracting the ΔCT value of the sample immunoprecipitated with p65 or p50 antiserum from that of the corresponding control sample with normal rabbit IgG. Fold-differences were determined by raising 2 to the ΔΔCT power. For detection of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the cultured cells were fixed with 70% ethanol, rinsed three times with deionized water, and treated with BCIP®/nitro blue tetrazolium solution (Sigma) for 15 min. The stained cultures were then documented on an Epson Perfection V700 photo scanner (Seiko Epson, Nagano, Japan). For quantitative comparison, color intensities were measured from scanned images using Image J software and normalized to the value of the untreated control group. The level of osteocalcin (OC) secreted into the culture medium was determined using a mouse osteocalcin ELISA kit (Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The study was performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Chonnam National University Animal Care and Use Committee. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Daehan Biolink (Eumsung, Korea) and 6-week-old male mice were randomly assigned to each experimental group. The animals were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of Zoletil (30 mg/kg; Virbac, Carros Cedex, France) and Rompun (10 mg/kg; Bayer Korea, Seoul, Korea). For ectopic bone formation, a sagittal incision (0.8–1.0 cm) was made on the back of each mouse and the subcutaneous pocket was formed by blunt dissecting. Absorbable collagen sponges (Colladerm, Bioland, Ochang, Korea) containing Ad-BMP2 and Ad-CREBH were implanted into the pocket. For an orthotopic model, a sagittal incision was made on the scalp, and the calvarium was exposed by blunt dissection. A critical-sized defect was created by means of a 5-mm diameter trephine bur (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA) under low speed drilling and copious phosphate-buffered saline irrigation. Ad-BMP2 and Ad-CREBH were administered into the defect with absorbable collagen sponges. The total amount of viruses was adjusted by adding Ad-GFP control virus. Three weeks after the implantation, bone formation was evaluated using a three-dimensional micro-computed tomography (μCT) system (model 1172, Skyscan, Aartselaar, Belgium). For the μCT analysis, the scanned images were collected at 50 kV and 200 μA and were reconstructed using the NRecon and CT analyzer software (Skyscan). For histology study, the implant or calvarial specimens were harvested, fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, decalcified in Calci-Clear Rapid (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA), embedded in paraffin, and then cut into sections of 4 μm thickness. The sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin, and evaluated for general tissue response and bone formation. All experiments were repeated at least three times and statistical analyses were performed using a Student’s t test or analysis of variance followed by Duncan’s multiple comparison test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate independent experiments. The proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6 increase Crebh mRNA expression in hepatocytes (31Zhang K. Shen X. Wu J. Sakaki K. Saunders T. Rutkowski D.T. Back S.H. Kaufman R.J. Endoplasmic reticulum stress activates cleavage of CREBH to induce a systemic inflammatory response.Cell. 2006; 124: 587-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether CREBH expression is also regulated by TNFα in osteoblasts. Treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells with TNFα increased Crebh mRNA expression significantly, but did not affect the expression of the Atf6 and Oasis mRNAs (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the bone-forming cytokine BMP2 induced Atf6 and Oasis mRNA, as described in other studies (9Murakami T. Saito A. Hino S. Kondo S. Kanemoto S. Chihara K. Sekiya H. Tsumagari K. Ochiai K. Yoshinaga K. Saitoh M. Nishimura R. Yoneda T. Kou I. Furuichi T. Ikegawa S. Ikawa M. Okabe M. Wanaka A. Imaizumi K. Signalling mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum stress transducer OASIS is involved in bone formation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 32Jang W.G. Kim E.J. Kim D.K. Ryoo H.M. Lee K.B. Kim S.H. Choi H.S. Koh J.T. BMP2 protein regulates osteocalcin expression via Runx2-mediated Atf6 gene transcription.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), but did not alter Crebh expression (Fig. 1B). Western blot analyses using total or nuclear protein extracts showed that TNFα also increased the CREBH protein level in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, both TNFα and tunicamycin, a strong ER stress inducer, increased the amount of the cleaved (nuclear) form of CREBH protein (Fig. 1, C and D). In response to ER stress, membrane-bound transcription factors, such as ATF6 and OASIS, are cleaved and a part of the cytosolic component is translocated to the nucleus to function as a transcription factor. Therefore, we determined whether TNFα can promote the translocation of the cleaved (active) form of CREBH protein to the nucleus using a GAL4-based luciferase reporter assay. Exposure of TNFα increased the luciferase activity of GAL4-fused full-length CREBH in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these results suggest that TNFα increases CREBH expression and may enhance its transcriptional activity in the nucleus. TNFα regulates the expression of several genes related to inflammation, by activation of the NF-κB pathway (33Ghosh S. Hayden M.S. New regulators of NF-κB in inflammation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). To determine whether this pathway is involved in TNFα-induced CREBH expression in osteoblasts, MC3T3-E1 cells were co-transfected with a Crebh reporter construct (CREBH-Luc), and a plasmid expressing the p50 and/or p65 subunits of NF-κB. The overexpression of p50 and p65 increased the luciferase activity of CREBH-Luc (Fig. 2A). Treatment of BAY11-7082, a chemical inhibitor of the IKK/NF-κB pathway, decreased the TNFα-induced Crebh promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). The compound also abrogated the TNFα induction of CREBH protein expression with the reduced phosphorylation of IκB (Fig. 2C). To more confirm the involvement of specific IKK/IκBα/NF-κB pathway in the TNFα-induced CREBH expression, we examined the effects of the dnIκBα (S32A/S36A) mutant, which is unable to be phosphorylated and proteolytically degraded (23Lee H.L. Yi T. Woo K.M. Ryoo H.M. Kim G.S. Baek J.H. Msx2 mediates the inhibitory action of TNF-α on osteoblast differentiation.Exp. Mol. Med. 2010; 42: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Transfection of dnIκBα effectively blocked TNFα-increased p65 and CREBH protein levels in nucleus and Crebh mRNA expression in the cells (Fig. 2, D and E). On the other hand, TNFα inhibited BMP2-induced Alp and Oc mRNA expressions and treatment of BAY-11-7082 was partially rescued the TNFα action (Fig. 2F). An in silico analysis revealed a consensus NF-κB binding site at nucleotides −112 to −103 relative to the transcription initiation site of the Crebh gene. TNFα failed to activate the luciferase activity of a mutant form of the Crebh promoter (M-CREBH-Luc) in which four nucleotides in the NF-κB binding site were substituted, compared with the WT-CREBH-Luc activity (Fig. 2G). In addition, ChIP-qPCR analysis showed treatment of TNFα enhanced the binding of NF-κB (p50 or p65) on the Crebh promoter (Fig. 2H). Taken together, these results suggest that TNFα stimulates CREBH expression by activating the NF-κB pathway. TNFα suppresses osteoblast differentiation by inhibiting the BMP signaling pathway (21Yamazaki M. Fukushima H. Shin M. Katagiri T. Doi T. Takahashi T. Jimi E. Tumor necrosis factor alpha represses bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling by interfering with the DNA binding of Smads through the activation of NF-κB.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35987-35995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether CREBH is involved in this process using gain- or loss-of-function experiments. TNFα inhibited BMP2-induced ALP activity and OC protein production (Figs. 3, A and B). In this condition, overexpression of CREBH using adenovirus encoding the nuclear form of CREBH (Ad-CREBH-N) dramatically inhibited BMP2 induction of ALP activity and OC production, as well as expression of osteogenic markers in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, C–E). TNFα still stimulated the activity of the Crebh promoter to some extent in the presence of BMP2 (Fig. 3F). However, overexpression of CREBH did not affect the expression of the mRNAs encoding osteoprotegerin (Opg) and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (Rankl) in primary osteoblasts, indicating that the expression of CREBH in osteoblasts might not be directly related to osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 3G). Next, we examined the effect of knockdown of CREBH using adenoviruses encoding an unspecific control shRNA (Ad-USi) or a CREBH-specific shRNA (Ad-CREBHi) on BMP2-induced osteoblast differentiation. Western blot analysis confirmed that treatment of Ad-CREBHi decreased the level of CREBH protein in MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 4A). Knockdown of CREBH attenuated the TNFα-mediated suppression of BMP2-induced expression of the Alp and Oc mRNAs (Fig. 4B), as well as OC protein production (Fig."

https://openalex.org/W1967599807,"Discovery of novel drug targets may lead to improved treatment of trypanosomiasis. We characterize here 2 gene products of Trypanosoma brucei that are essential for the growth of bloodstream form (BSF) parasites, as shown by RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated down-regulation of the individual mRNAs. The primary sequences of the 2 proteins--protein encoded by gene Tb927.1.4450 (TbK1) and protein encoded by gene Tb927.9.4820 (TbK2)--indicate that both belong to the family of putative, Ca(2+)-activated potassium channels. The proteins were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and their functions investigated by use of electrophysiological techniques. Only combined expression of TbK1 and TbK2 results in the formation of sizeable currents, indicating that these proteins probably assemble into a heteromeric ion channel. The current mediated by this channel shows little time and voltage dependence and displays a permeability ratio of K(+)/Na(+) of >20. The known potassium channel blocker barium inhibits this channel with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 98 ± 15 μM. The membrane potential of trypanosomes was measured with a fluorescent dye. Individual RNAi-mediated down-regulation of TbK1 or TbK2 eliminates a potassium conductance in the plasma membrane of BSF. Thus, this heteromeric potassium channel is involved in the modulation of the plasma membrane potential and represents a novel drug target in T. brucei."
https://openalex.org/W2080112974,"GPIHBP1 is an endothelial membrane protein that transports lipoprotein lipase (LPL) from the subendothelial space to the luminal side of the capillary endothelium. Here, we provide evidence that two regions of GPIHBP1, the acidic N-terminal domain and the central Ly6 domain, interact with LPL as two distinct binding sites. This conclusion is based on comparative binding studies performed with a peptide corresponding to the N-terminal domain of GPIHBP1, the Ly6 domain of GPIHBP1, wild type GPIHBP1, and the Ly6 domain mutant GPIHBP1 Q114P. Although LPL and the N-terminal domain formed a tight but short lived complex, characterized by fast on- and off-rates, the complex between LPL and the Ly6 domain formed more slowly and persisted for a longer time. Unlike the interaction of LPL with the Ly6 domain, the interaction of LPL with the N-terminal domain was significantly weakened by salt. The Q114P mutant bound LPL similarly to the N-terminal domain of GPIHBP1. Heparin dissociated LPL from the N-terminal domain, and partially from wild type GPIHBP1, but was unable to elute the enzyme from the Ly6 domain. When LPL was in complex with the acidic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal domain of GPIHBP1, the enzyme retained its affinity for the Ly6 domain. Furthermore, LPL that was bound to the N-terminal domain interacted with lipoproteins, whereas LPL bound to the Ly6 domain did not. In summary, our data suggest that the two domains of GPIHBP1 interact independently with LPL and that the functionality of LPL depends on its localization on GPIHBP1."
https://openalex.org/W2004094447,"We recently showed that it is possible to compromise tumor vessel function and, as a consequence, suppress growth of aggressive preclinical tumors by immunizing against the tumor vascular markers extra domain-A (ED-A) or -B (ED-B) of fibronectin, using a fusion protein consisting of the ED-A or ED-B peptide fused to bacterial thioredoxin. To address the mechanism behind fusion protein-induced immunization and the specific contribution of the different vaccine constituents to elicit an anti-self-antibody response, we immunized mice with modified or unmodified self-antigens, combined with different adjuvant components, and analyzed antibody responses by ELISA in sera. Several essential requirements to circumvent tolerance were identified: (1) a potent pattern recognition receptor agonist like an oligonucleotide containing unmethylated cytosine and guanine dinucleotides (CpG); (2) a depot adjuvant to keep the CpG at the site of injection; and (3) the presence of foreign sequences in the vaccine protein. Lack of either of these factors abolished the anti-self-response (P = 0.008). In mice genetically deficient for type I IFN signaling, there was a 60% reduction in the anti-self-response compared with wild-type (P = 0.011), demonstrating a key role of this pathway in CpG-induced circumvention of self-tolerance. Identification of these mechanistic requirements to generate a potent anti-self-immune response should significantly aid the design of efficient, specific, and safe therapeutic cancer vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2089207443,"Background and Aims Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a risk factor for development and progression of heart failure (HF). CKD and HF share common risk factors, but few data exist on the prevalence, signs and symptoms as well as correlates of HF in populations with CKD of moderate severity. We therefore aimed to examine the prevalence and correlates of HF in the German Chronic Kidney Disease (GCKD) study, a large observational prospective study. Methods and Results We analyzed data from 5,015 GCKD patients aged 18–74 years with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of <60 ml/min/1.73m² or with an eGFR ≥60 and overt proteinuria (>500 mg/d). We evaluated a definition of HF based on the Gothenburg score, a clinical HF score used in epidemiological studies (Gothenburg HF), and self-reported HF. Factors associated with HF were identified using multivariable adjusted logistic regression. The prevalence of Gothenburg HF was 43% (ranging from 24% in those with eGFR >90 to 59% in those with eGFR<30 ml/min/1.73m2). The corresponding estimate for self-reported HF was 18% (range 5%-24%). Lower eGFR was significantly and independently associated with the Gothenburg definition of HF (p-trend <0.001). Additional significantly associated correlates included older age, female gender, higher BMI, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, valvular heart disease, anemia, sleep apnea, and lower educational status. Conclusions The burden of self-reported and Gothenburg HF among patients with CKD is high. The proportion of patients who meet the criteria for Gothenburg HF in a European cohort of patients with moderate CKD is more than twice as high as the prevalence of self-reported HF. However, because of the shared signs, symptoms and medications of HF and CKD, the Gothenburg score cannot be used to reliably define HF in CKD patients. Our results emphasize the need for early screening for HF in patients with CKD."

Macrophage Inhibitory Cytokine-1 (MIC-1/GDF15) is a divergent transforming growth factor - beta (TGF-β) superfamily cytokine. To uncover the underlying mechanisms of the previous finding of a negative association between MIC-1/GDF15 serum levels and cognition, the present study aimed to examine the relationship of circulating MIC-1/GDF15 levels with human brain gray matter (GM) volumes, in a community-dwelling sample aged 70-90 years over two years (Wave 1: n = 506, Wave 2: n = 327), of which the age-related brain atrophy had been previously well defined. T1-weighted MRI scans were obtained at both waves and analyzed using the FMRIB Software Library and FreeSurfer. The results showed significantly negative associations between MIC-1/GDF15 serum levels and both subcortical and cortical GM volumes. GM volumes of the whole brain, cortex, temporal lobe, thalamus and accumbens showed significant mediating effects on the associations between MIC-1/GDF15 serum levels and global cognition scores. Increases in MIC-1/GDF15 serum levels were associated with decreases in cortical and subcortical GM volume over two years. In conclusion, MIC-1/GDF15 serum levels were inversely associated with GM volumes both cross-sectionally and longitudinally."
https://openalex.org/W1565365512,"Abstract The enzyme family of heterotrimeric AMP-dependent protein kinases is activated upon low energy states, conferring a switch toward energy-conserving metabolic pathways through immediate kinase actions on enzyme targets and delayed alterations in gene expression through its nuclear relocalization. This family is evolutionarily conserved, including the presence of a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) motif in most catalytic subunits. The potential for the UBA domain to promote protein associations or direct subcellular location, as seen in other UBA-containing proteins, led us to query whether the UBA domain within the yeast AMP-dependent protein kinase ortholog, SNF1 kinase, was important in these aspects of its regulation. Here, we demonstrate that conserved UBA motif mutations significantly alter SNF1 kinase activation and biological activity, including enhanced allosteric subunit associations and increased oxidative stress resistance and life span. Significantly, the enhanced UBA-dependent longevity and oxidative stress response are at least partially dependent on the Fkh1 and Fkh2 stress response transcription factors, which in turn are shown to influence Snf1 gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2074196953,"For conservation purposes, it is important to take into account the suitability of a species to particular habitats; this information may predict the long-term survival of a species. In this sense, morphological measures of developmental stress, such as fluctuating asymmetry, can be proxies for an individual’s performance in different regions. In this study, we conducted tests to determine whether areas with different levels of suitability for a species (generated by ecological niche models) were congruent with morphological markers that reflect environmental stress and morphological variance. We generated a Maxent niche model and compared the suitability assessments of several areas with the skull morphology data (fluctuating asymmetry and morphological disparity) of populations of the Atlantic forest endemic to Brazil rodent Akodon cursor. Our analyses showed a significant negative relationship between suitability levels and fluctuating asymmetry levels, which indicates that in less suitable areas, the individuals experience numerous disturbances during skull ontogeny. We have not found an association between morphological variance and environmental suitability. As expected, these results suggest that in environments with a lower suitability, developmental stress is increased. Such information is helpful in the understanding of the species evolution and in the selection of priority areas for the conservation of species."
https://openalex.org/W2032019405,"According to the Conceptual Metaphor Theory, people understand abstract concepts depending on the activation of more concrete concepts, but not vice versa. The present research aims to investigate the role of directionality and automaticity regarding the activation of the conceptual metaphor ""good is up"". Experiment 1 tested the automaticity of the spatial-to-valence metaphoric congruency effect by having participants judge the valence of a positive or negative word that appeared either at the top or at the bottom of the screen. They performed the task concurrently with a 6-digit verbal rehearsal task in the working-memory-load (WML) blocks and without this task in the non-WML blocks. The spatial-to-valence metaphoric congruency effect occurred for the positive words in the non-WML blocks (i.e., positive words are judged more quickly when they appeared at the top than at the bottom of the screen), but not in the WML blocks, suggesting that this metaphoric association might not be activated automatically. Experiments 2-6 investigated the valence-to-spatial metaphoric association and its automaticity. Participants processed a positive or negative prime, which appeared at the center of the screen, and then identified a letter (p/q) that subsequently appeared at the top or bottom of the screen. The valence-to-spatial metaphoric congruency effect did not occur in the WML (6-digit verbal rehearsal) or non-WML blocks, whether response modality to the prime was key-press or vocal, or whether the prime was a word or a picture. The effect only unexpectedly occurred when the task was simultaneously performed with a 4-dot-position visuospatial rehearsal task. Nevertheless, the data collapsed across multiple experiments showed a null valence-to-spatial metaphoric congruency effect, suggesting the absence of the valence-to-spatial metaphoric association in general. The implications of the current findings for the Conceptual Metaphor Theory and its alternatives are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2036647353,"Background Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B viruses have co-circulated in the human population since the swine-origin human H1N1 pandemic in 2009. While infections of these subtypes generally cause mild illnesses, lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) occurs in a portion of children and required hospitalization. The aim of our study was to estimate the prevalence of these three subtypes and compare the clinical manifestations in hospitalized children with LRTI in Guangzhou, China during the post-pandemic period. Methods Children hospitalized with LRTI from January 2010 to December 2012 were tested for influenza A/B virus infection from their throat swab specimens using real-time PCR and the clinical features of the positive cases were analyzed. Results Of 3637 hospitalized children, 216 (5.9%) were identified as influenza A or B positive. Infection of influenza virus peaked around March in Guangzhou each year from 2010 to 2012, and there were distinct epidemics of each subtype. Influenza A(H3N2) infection was more frequently detected than A(H1N1)pdm09 and B, overall. The mean age of children with influenza A virus (H1N1/H3N2) infection was younger than those with influenza B (34.4 months/32.5 months versus 45 months old; p<0.005). Co-infections of influenza A/ B with mycoplasma pneumoniae were found in 44/216 (20.3%) children. Conclusions This study contributes the understanding to the prevalence of seasonal influenza viruses in hospitalized children with LRTI in Guangzhou, China during the post pandemic period. High rate of mycoplasma pneumoniae co-infection with influenza viruses might contribute to severe disease in the hospitalized children."

The addition of bacteria and nematodes and incubation time all significantly affected plant growth, plant root growth, plant nutrient concentrations, soil nutrient concentrations, soil microorganisms and soil auxin concentration. The addition of nematodes caused greater increases in these indices than those of bacteria, while the addition of the combination of bacteria and nematodes caused further increases. After 42-day growth, the increases in soil respiration differed between the additions of two kinds of nematodes because of differences in their life strategies. The effects of the bacteria and nematodes on the nutrient and hormone concentrations were responsible for the increases in plant growth.

The inner part of the IRR DNA sequence is recognized by the Mos1 DNA-binding domain of one transposase monomer, in cis (see Fig. 1C); this domain (residues 1–112) comprises two helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs connected by a minor groove-binding linker. The outer IRR sequence (containing three unpaired bases at the reactive 3′ end that mimic the product of the staggered double-strand break) is recognized by the catalytic domain of the other transposase monomer, in a trans arrangement (see Fig. 1D). Previously, it was shown that the N-terminal 150 residues of Mos1 transposase, containing the DNA-binding domain, have 5–10 times higher affinity for the right Mos1 IR sequence than the left IR (IRL) (20Zhang L.

The difference in affinity for the two ends was attributed primarily to the base difference at position 16 (15Augé-Gouillou C. Hamelin M.H. Demattei M.V. Periquet M. Bigot Y.

To understand the structural basis of this reduced binding affinity, we have determined a crystal structure of the Mos1 PEC containing the IRL transposon sequence, to a resolution of 3.1 Å. This reveals subtle differences in the interactions of the minor groove-binding linker with the IRL sequence and explains the reduced affinity of the Mos1 DNA-binding domain for this end. Surprisingly, the structure also reveals additional interactions between the guanine base at the reactive 3′ end of the IRL and Glu-345, the C-terminal amino acid of Mos1 transposase, which likely restrain the position of 3′ base and hinder transposition. We also compared the IR preferences in the subsequent steps of the transposition reaction: DNA cleavage and DNA strand transfer. To establish whether there are common features in the recognition and activity of mariner transposon ends, we compared the activities of Mos1 and Mboumar-9 transposases. We found that both transposases have a preferred end for in vitro cleavage and in vitro strand transfer. Moreover, we found that an adenine base at the reactive 3′ transposon end is optimal for both Mos1 and Mboumar-9 in vitro transposition. On this basis, we improved the efficiency of Mboumar-9 transposition by 3.9-fold. Plasmids containing a kanamycin resistance (kanR) gene flanked by two transposon IRL sequences, two IRR sequences, or one IRL and one IRR were created by first amplifying the kanR cassette from pUC4K with two primers carrying the Mos1 IRR or IRL sequences or the Mboumar-9 IRR or IRL sequences. Additionally, the primers introduced either a SacI site (with IRL) or an XbaI site (with IRR). This enabled cloning of the 1.3-kb PCR products into the pEP185.2 plasmid containing the conditional origin of replication, oriR6K. In this way six donor transposon plasmids (pEPMosLL, pEPMosLR, pEPMosRR, pEPMboLL, pEPMboLR, and pEPMboRR) were generated. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the pEPMboLL plasmid to create a new donor transposon (pEPMboLL-G3′A) in which the guanine base at the 3′ end of both IRLs was replaced by adenine. DNA sequencing confirmed the presence of the mutations. Both transposases contained the mutation T216A, previously shown to promote expression of soluble Mos1 in Escherichia coli, and were purified as described previously (17Trubitsyna M. Morris E.R.

Mboumar-9 transposase (0.5 mg/ml, 82% pure) was snap-frozen in 20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT and stored at −80 °C. Duplex IRL and IRR DNA substrates were prepared by annealing the 28-nt transferred strand (TS) with its complementary 25-nt non-transferred strand (NTS) in TEN buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). These oligonucleotides had the sequences shown in Fig. 1A and were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. For the strand transfer assays, the fluorescent label IRDye® 700 was incorporated at the 5′ end of the TS (oligonucleotides synthesized by Metabion) to enable detection. The 50-mer target DNA substrate, containing one TA dinucleotide, was prepared by annealing the sequence 5′-AGCAGTCCACTAGTGCACGACCGTTCAAAGCTTCGGAACGGGACACTGTT with its complementary strand, followed by PAGE purification. Analogous to preparation of the Mos1 PEC containing the IRR (19Richardson J.M. Finnegan D.J.

The final PEC concentration was 52 μm. Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion in hanging drops in Linbro plates at 17 °C. The well solution contained 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.8, 100 mm ammonium acetate, 450 mm KCl, and 5 mm MnCl2. To improve diffraction quality, initial crystals were used for micro-seeding. A seed stock was prepared by diluting three crushed crystals in 100 μl of well solution. Crystals were grown in hanging drops containing 1.5 μl of complex, 1.5 μl of well solution, and 1.5 μl of a seed stock and flash-frozen prior to data collection, as described previously for the Mos1 IRR PEC (19Richardson J.M.

X-ray diffraction data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) (BM14) equipped with an ADSC quantum 210 detector. The crystal displayed monoclinic P21 symmetry and diffracted x-rays to a maximum resolution of 3.1 Å. Initial phases were determined by molecular replacement using the structure of the Mos1 PEC containing IRR DNA (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 3HOS) as the model. Coot (24Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G.

Restrained refinement was performed with Refmac in the CCP4 suite (25Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 The Ccp4 suite: programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. The Ramachandran statistics were calculated using MOLPROBITY. All structural figures were prepared using PyMOL.TABLE 1X-ray diffraction data and refinement statistics Open table in a new tab The IRR and IRL DNA structures were docked onto the protein from the IRL PEC structure using AutoDock 4.2.3 (26Huey R.

To prepare the required input files, water molecules and other heteroatoms were first removed from the crystal structures. Then position-optimized hydrogen atoms were assigned using the program PDB2PQR 1.6 (27Dolinsky T.J. Czodrowski P. Li H. Nielsen J.E. Jensen J.H. Klebe G. Baker N.A. PDB2PQR: expanding and upgrading automated preparation of biomolecular structures for molecular simulations.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W522-W525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar), utilizing the optional PropKa algorithm (28Li H. Robertson A.D. Jensen J.H. Very fast empirical prediction and rationalization of protein pKa values.Proteins. 2005; 61: 704-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar) with a pH of 7.4 to predict protonation states. The AutoDock Tools 1.5.4 utilities prepare_receptor4.py and prepare_ligand4.py were used to assign Gasteiger charges to protein atoms and Gasteiger charges and hydrogen atoms to the DNA ligands, respectively. The size of the docking search space was set at 4 Å around the DNA ligands (i.e. 8 Å was added to each of the maximum x, y, and z dimensions of the molecules), with the center of the ligand defining the center of the search space. The AutoGrid grid point spacing was set at 0.2 Å. The AutoDock parameter file specified 10 Lamarckian genetic algorithm runs for each docking with 5,000,000 energy evaluations and random initial placement (translation and rotation) of the ligand. Donor transposon plasmid (5.6 kb, 500 ng, 7.24 nm) was incubated with Mos1 or Mboumar-9 transposase (protein:DNA molar ratio 5:1) in 20-μl final volume for 1 h at 30 °C in a buffer containing: 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 12.5 μg/ml BSA, 2 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 10 mm MnCl2 or MgCl2. To stop the reaction, 0.4 μl of 500 mm EDTA was added, and the products were analyzed by agarose (1% w/v) gel electrophoresis. The percentage of backbone released was calculated by comparing the intensity of the backbone bands with the total intensity in the lane averaged from four gels. Transposon donor plasmid (5.6 kb, 500 ng, 7.24 nm) was incubated with the pBSKS+ target plasmid (3 kb, 300 ng) and 72.4 nm transposase for 1 h at 30 °C in 20-μl final volume. The buffer contained 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 200 μg/ml acetylated BSA, and 10 mm MnCl2 or MgCl2. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 80 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 μg/ml proteinase K, 10 mm EDTA, and 6.25 μg/ml yeast tRNA and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. DNA was phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 10 μl of nuclease free water (Qiagen). Chemically competent cells (100 μl) E. coli DH10B (107 CFU/μg) were transfected with 10 μl of DNA, and after heat shock and recovery, half was plated out on LB agar containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) to select for transposition products. Up to 8,000 colonies per 1 μg of the donor plasmid were obtained, corresponding to a transposition efficiency of 8 × 10−4. Reactions contained 15 nm 50-mer target DNA, 1.5 nm IRR or IRL DNA and 15 nm Mos1 or Mboumar-9 transposase in a final volume of 20 μl containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm Potassium Acetate, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml BSA and 20% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Reactions were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C, and the products were separated on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel as described previously (18Richardson J.M. Colloms S.D. Finnegan D.J.

Biol. 2014; 9: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To visualize the products, the IRDye® 700 was excited at 680 nm and detected on a LI-COR Odyssey CLx system. The fluorescence intensities of the product bands were quantified using Image Studio software. The percentage of integration is calculated by dividing the intensity of the product band with the total fluorescence intensity in the lane. The 28-bp right and left IRs of Mos1 differ at four positions (Fig. 1A). Each of these involves substitution of A or T in the IRR for G or C in the IRL. Consequently, the IRR sequence has a higher AT content (64.3%) than the IRL sequence (50%). Three of the substitutions are located in the inner IR, at positions 16, 18, and 26 of the NTS. In the Mos1 IRR PEC crystal structure, T26 and its complementary base (A31 on the TS) are close to the major groove recognized by the first HTH motif (Fig. 1C). Both T16 and A18, and their complementary bases (A41 and T39, respectively), are in the region recognized by the minor groove-binding linker (Fig. 1C). None of the bases differing between the IRR and IRL are involved in direct base to side-chain interactions with the Mos1 transposase DNA-binding domain. The fourth difference between the IRR and IRL sequences is at the reactive 3′ end of the transposon IR, at position 56. In the Mos1 IRR PEC crystal structure, A56 is unpaired and makes a purine-specific contact with the side chain of Arg-183, via N7 (Fig. 1D). The 32-bp Mboumar-9 IRL and IRR sequences differ at only two positions: 6 and 20 of the non-transferred strand (Fig. 1B). The base at position 6 is A in the IRR sequence and T in the IRL sequence, whereas T20 in the IRR is C20 in the IRL sequence. The base pairs at the equivalent positions of the Mos1 IRR have no contacts with the protein in the Mos1 PEC structure. Crystals of the Mos1 IRL PEC were formed by mixing full-length Mos1 transposase (T216A mutant) with duplex IRL DNA (Fig. 1A). This had a 3-nt overhang at the 3′ end of the transferred strand, mimicking the product of staggered transposon excision. The monoclinic crystals diffracted x-rays to a maximum resolution of 3.1 Å. The crystallographic phases were determined by molecular replacement using our previous structure of the Mos1 IRR PEC as the model (PDB ID: 3HOS). The data collection, merging, and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. The Mos1 IRL PEC structure has a similar overall architecture to the Mos1 IRR PEC described previously (18Richardson J.M. Colloms S.D. Finnegan D.J. Walkinshaw M.D. Molecular architecture of the Mos1 paired-end complex: the structural basis of DNA transposition in a eukaryote.Cell. 2009; 138: 1096-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and comprises a transposase dimer bound to two IRL DNA molecules in a crossed configuration; one IRL DNA is bound by the DNA-binding domain of one monomer and the catalytic domain of the other monomer, and vice versa. As before, two additional IRL DNA duplexes interact with the catalytic domains, possibly occupying the binding sites of target DNA (30Dornan J. Grey H. Richardson J.M. Structural role of the flanking DNA in mariner transposon excision.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: 2424-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The linker between HTH1 and HTH2 binds in the minor groove of IR DNA between nucleotides 15 and 18 on the non-transferred strand primarily by shape complementarity (Figs. 1C and 2A). The lower affinity of transposase for the IRL has been attributed mainly to sequence differences in this region (15Augé-Gouillou C. Hamelin M.H. Demattei M.V. Periquet M. Bigot Y. The wild-type conformation of the Mos-1 inverted terminal repeats is suboptimal for transposition in bacteria.Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 265: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the Mos1 IRL PEC, the linker is displaced out of the minor groove, by a maximum of 1.7 Å at the amide bond between His-65 and Gly-66, as compared with its position in the IRR PEC (Fig. 2A). This is due in part to the higher GC content of the IRL sequence in this region as compared with the IRR sequence; the guanine 2-amino group adds bulk and hydrogen bond donors in the minor groove that obstruct transposase linker binding. Moreover, the pyrimidine-specific interaction between T16 O2 and the backbone amide of Lys-67 in the IRR PEC is lost in the IRL PEC because T16 is replaced by G in the IRL sequence (Fig. 2B). Additionally, the O2 of C41 (base-paired with G16) repels the backbone carbonyl of Lys-67 in the PEC IRL structure. Other features of this central IR region are similar in both the IRR and IRL PEC structures. The pyrimidine-specific interaction between O2 of C40 and HD1 of the His-65 side chain is maintained, and there are no changes in the minor groove width between the two structures, as has been observed for example in interactions of the Fis-binding protein with minor groove DNA (31Hancock S.P. Ghane T. Cascio D. Rohs R. Di Felice R. Johnson R.C. Control of DNA minor groove width and Fis protein binding by the purine 2-amino group.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 6750-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This is similar to an AT hook (palindromic consensus sequence Pro-Arg-Gly-Arg-Pro), which inserts into AT-rich minor grooves so that the Arg side chains run parallel with the groove, without bending, expanding, or unwinding the double helix (32Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. The solution structure of an HMG-I(Y)-DNA complex defines a new architectural minor groove binding motif.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). HTH1 binds in the major groove of the inner IR in both the IRL and IRR PEC structures; the side chains of Arg-48 and Lys-44 form base-specific interactions with G22 and G33, respectively (Fig. 2C). In this region, the proximity of the carboxylate side chain of Glu-47 and the N7 of A31 in the IRR sequence (4.2 Å apart) provides the potential for an additional, purine-specific interaction, mediated either by a water molecule or by protonation of the Glu-47 side-chain carboxylate. However, no such additional interaction would be possible with the IRL sequence, where A31 is replaced by C31. At the reactive 3′ end of the inverted repeat, the three unpaired bases on the transferred strand are held in place by sequence-specific interactions with the transposase clamp loop residues. Arg-118 contacts both T54 and G55, and Arg-183 interacts with the N7 of the terminal p"
https://openalex.org/W2103600898,"Background Interferon-release assays (IGRAs) for diagnosing active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) are not yet fully validated, particularly in high TB-endemic areas as the People's Republic of China (PRC). The aim of this report was to assess the performance of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube (QFT-GIT) and tuberculin skin test (TST), in addition to microbiological results, as contributors for diagnosing active PTB in the PRC. Methods/Principal Findings A total of 300 PTB patients, 41 disease controls (DC) and 59 healthy community controls (HCC) were included prospectively between May 2010 and April 2011 from two provinces of the PRC (Heilongjiang and Zhejiang). The QFT-GIT and TST yielded an overall sensitivity for active TB of 80.9% and 86.2%, and a specificity of 36.6% and 26.8%, respectively. The province of origin and smear microscopy status did not significantly impact the diagnostic values for PTB. However, using the TST with a 10 mm cut-off point, a significantly higher proportion of LTBI was observed in the DC than the HCC (p=0.01). Discordant results between the QFT-GIT and TST were found among 1/3 of the PTB, HCC and DC. Two-thirds of the individuals presented TST-positive/QFT-GIT-negative discordant results. The TST-negative/QFT-GIT-positive result was not associated with age or bacillary load. Cumulative QFT-GIT and TST positive results increased the overall sensitivity (95.9%), but it was associated with a dramatic decrease of the overall specificity (24.8%) leading to a suboptimal PPV (80.1%) and a low NPV (61.1%). Conclusions/Significance The usefulness of the QFT-GIT to diagnose active TB in high TB-endemic countries remains doubtful because like the TST, the QFT-GIT cannot distinguish between LTBI and active TB. Used as single stand-alone tests, both the QFT-GIT and TST have very limited roles in the diagnosis of active PTB. However, the combined use of SM, the TST and QFT-GIT may allow for the exclusion of ATB."
https://openalex.org/W2080804180,"Sea-level rise and frequent intense hurricanes associated with climate change will result in recurrent flooding of inland systems such as Gulf Coastal pitcher plant bogs by storm surges. These surges can transport salt water and sediment to freshwater bogs, greatly affecting their biological integrity. Purple pitcher plants (Sarracenia rosea) are Gulf Coast pitcher plant bog inhabitants that could be at a disadvantage under this scenario because their pitcher morphology may leave them prone to collection of saline water and sediment after a surge. We investigated the effects of storm surge water salinity and sediment type on S. rosea vitality, plant community structure, and bog soil-water conductivity. Plots (containing ≥1 ramet of S. rosea) were experimentally flooded with fresh or saline water crossed with one of three sediment types (local, foreign, or no sediment). There were no treatment effects on soil-water conductivity; nevertheless, direct exposure to saline water resulted in significantly lower S. rosea cover until the following season when a prescribed fire and regional drought contributed to the decline of all the S. rosea to near zero percent cover. There were also significant differences in plant community structure between treatments over time, reflecting how numerous species increased in abundance and a few species decreased in abundance. However, in contrast to S. rosea, most of the other species in the community appeared resilient to the effects of storm surge. Thus, although the community may be somewhat affected by storm surge, those few species that are particularly sensitive to the storm surge disturbance will likely drop out of the community and be replaced by more resilient species. Depending on the longevity of these biological legacies, Gulf Coastal pitcher plant bogs may be incapable of fully recovering if they become exposed to storm surge more frequently due to climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2016366552,"Glutamatergic neurotransmission is evolutionarily conserved across animal phyla. A major class of glutamate receptors consists of the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). In C. elegans, three mGluR genes, mgl-1, mgl-2, and mgl-3, are organized into three subgroups, similar to their mammalian counterparts. Cellular reporters identified expression of the mgls in the nervous system of C. elegans and overlapping expression in the pharyngeal microcircuit that controls pharyngeal muscle activity and feeding behavior. The overlapping expression of mgls within this circuit allowed the investigation of receptor signaling per se and in the context of receptor interactions within a neural network that regulates feeding. We utilized the pharmacological manipulation of neuronally regulated pumping of the pharyngeal muscle in the wild-type and mutants to investigate MGL function. This defined a net mgl-1-dependent inhibition of pharyngeal pumping that is modulated by mgl-3 excitation. Optogenetic activation of the pharyngeal glutamatergic inputs combined with electrophysiological recordings from the isolated pharyngeal preparations provided further evidence for a presynaptic mgl-1-dependent regulation of pharyngeal activity. Analysis of mgl-1, mgl-2, and mgl-3 mutant feeding behavior in the intact organism after acute food removal identified a significant role for mgl-1 in the regulation of an adaptive feeding response. Our data describe the molecular and cellular organization of mgl-1, mgl-2, and mgl-3. Pharmacological analysis identified that, in these paradigms, mgl-1 and mgl-3, but not mgl-2, can modulate the pharyngeal microcircuit. Behavioral analysis identified mgl-1 as a significant determinant of the glutamate-dependent modulation of feeding, further highlighting the significance of mGluRs in complex C. elegans behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2053441616,"Our aim was to develop a fast and accurate algorithm for constructing consensus genetic maps for chip-based SNP genotyping data with a high proportion of shared markers between mapping populations. Chip-based genotyping of SNP markers allows producing high-density genetic maps with a relatively standardized set of marker loci for different mapping populations. The availability of a standard high-throughput mapping platform simplifies consensus analysis by ignoring unique markers at the stage of consensus mapping thereby reducing mathematical complicity of the problem and in turn analyzing bigger size mapping data using global optimization criteria instead of local ones. Our three-phase analytical scheme includes automatic selection of ~100-300 of the most informative (resolvable by recombination) markers per linkage group, building a stable skeletal marker order for each data set and its verification using jackknife re-sampling, and consensus mapping analysis based on global optimization criterion. A novel Evolution Strategy optimization algorithm with a global optimization criterion presented in this paper is able to generate high quality, ultra-dense consensus maps, with many thousands of markers per genome. This algorithm utilizes ""potentially good orders"" in the initial solution and in the new mutation procedures that generate trial solutions, enabling to obtain a consensus order in reasonable time. The developed algorithm, tested on a wide range of simulated data and real world data (Arabidopsis), outperformed two tested state-of-the-art algorithms by mapping accuracy and computation time."
https://openalex.org/W2063412145,"Introduction Tamoxifen is an anti-estrogen drug used in treatment of Estrogen Receptor (ER) positive breast cancer. Effects and side effects of tamoxifen is the sum of tamoxifen and all its metabolites. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4OHtam) and 4-hydroxy-N-demethyltamoxifen (4OHNDtam, endoxifen) both have ER affinity exceeding that of the parent drug tamoxifen. 4OHNDtam is considered the main active metabolite of tamoxifen. Ndesmethyltamoxifen (NDtam) is the major tamoxifen metabolite. It has low affinity to the ER and is not believed to influence tumor growth. However, NDtam might mediate adverse effects of tamoxifen treatment. In this study we investigated the gene regulatory effects of the three metabolites of tamoxifen in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Material and Methods Using concentrations that mimic the clinical situation we examined effects of 4OHtam, 4OHNDtam and NDtam on global gene expression in 17β-estradiol (E2) treated MCF-7 cells. Transcriptomic responses were assessed by correspondence analysis, differential expression, gene ontology analysis and quantitative real time PCR (Q-rt-PCR). E2 deprivation and knockdown of Steroid Receptor Coactivator-3 (SRC-3)/Amplified in Breast Cancer 1 (AIB1) mRNA in MCF-7 cells were performed to further characterize specific effects on gene expression. Results 4OHNDtam and 4OHtam caused major changes in gene expression compared to treatment with E2 alone, with a stronger effect of 4OHNDtam. NDtam had nearly no effect on the global gene expression profile. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with 4OHNDtam led to a strong down-regulation of the CytoKeratin 6 isoforms (KRT6A, KRT6B and KRT6C). The CytoKeratin 6 mRNAs were also down-regulated in MCF-7 cells after E2 deprivation and after SRC-3/AIB1 knockdown. Conclusion Using concentrations that mimic the clinical situation we report global gene expression changes that were most pronounced with 4OHNDtam and minimal with NDtam. Genes encoding CytoKeratin 6, were highly down-regulated by 4OHNDtam, as well as after E2 deprivation and knockdown of SRC-3/AIB1, indicating an estrogen receptor-dependent regulation."

Belief and importance are conceptualized as two coordinates, together defining the belimp plane. We tested fundamental aspects of the theory using four different planes based on the life domains of appearance, family, financial security, and friendship as well as a global plane combining these four domains. The criteria were from the areas of personality (Big Five and trait emotional intelligence) and learning styles. Two hundred and fifty eight participants were allocated into the four quadrants of the belimp plane (Hubris, Motivation, Depression, and Apathy) according to their scores on four reliable instruments. Most hypotheses were supported by the data. Results are discussed with reference to the stability of the belimp classifications under different life domains and the relationship of the quadrants with the personality traits that are hypothesized to underpin them."
