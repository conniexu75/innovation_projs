https://openalex.org/W2167857702,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are responsible for the majority of cellular responses to hormones and neurotransmitters as well as the senses of sight, olfaction and taste. The paradigm of GPCR signalling is the activation of a heterotrimeric GTP binding protein (G protein) by an agonist-occupied receptor. The β(2) adrenergic receptor (β(2)AR) activation of Gs, the stimulatory G protein for adenylyl cyclase, has long been a model system for GPCR signalling. Here we present the crystal structure of the active state ternary complex composed of agonist-occupied monomeric β(2)AR and nucleotide-free Gs heterotrimer. The principal interactions between the β(2)AR and Gs involve the amino- and carboxy-terminal α-helices of Gs, with conformational changes propagating to the nucleotide-binding pocket. The largest conformational changes in the β(2)AR include a 14 Å outward movement at the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment 6 (TM6) and an α-helical extension of the cytoplasmic end of TM5. The most surprising observation is a major displacement of the α-helical domain of Gαs relative to the Ras-like GTPase domain. This crystal structure represents the first high-resolution view of transmembrane signalling by a GPCR."
https://openalex.org/W1989987141,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a family of molecules that are continuously generated, transformed and consumed in all living organisms as a consequence of aerobic life. The traditional view of these reactive oxygen metabolites is one of oxidative stress and damage that leads to decline of tissue and organ systems in aging and disease. However, emerging data show that ROS produced in certain situations can also contribute to physiology and increased fitness. This Perspective provides a focused discussion on what factors lead ROS molecules to become signal and/or stress agents, highlighting how increasing knowledge of the underlying chemistry of ROS can lead to advances in understanding their disparate contributions to biology. An important facet of this emerging area at the chemistry-biology interface is the development of new tools to study these small molecules and their reactivity in complex biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W1966776937,"In inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), intestinal barrier function is impaired as a result of deteriorations in epithelial tight junction (TJ) structure. IL-6, a pleiotropic cytokine, is elevated in IBD patients, although the role of IL-6 in barrier function remains unknown. We present evidence that IL-6 increases TJ permeability by stimulating the expression of channel-forming claudin-2, which is required for increased caudal-related homeobox (Cdx) 2 through the MEK/ERK and PI3K pathways in intestinal epithelial cells. IL-6 increases the cation-selective TJ permeability without any changes to uncharged dextran flux or cell viability in Caco-2 cells. IL-6 markedly induces claudin-2 expression, which is associated with increased TJ permeability. The colonic mucosa of mice injected with IL-6 also exhibits an increase in claudin-2 expression. The claudin-2 expression and TJ permeability induced by IL-6 are sensitive to the inhibition of gp130, MEK, and PI3K. Furthermore, expression of WT-MEK1 induces claudin-2 expression in Caco-2 cells. Claudin-2 promoter activity is increased by IL-6 in a MEK/ERK and PI3K-dependent manner, and deletion of Cdx binding sites in the promoter sequence results in a loss of IL-6-induced promoter activity. IL-6 increases Cdx2 protein expression, which is suppressed by the inhibition of MEK and PI3K. These observations may reveal an important mechanism by which IL-6 can undermine the integrity of the intestinal barrier.

One of the most important functions of gastrointestinal epithelial cells is to provide a physical barrier to the diffusion of pathogens, toxins, and antigens from the luminal environment into the circulation. This depends on the coordinated expression and interaction of proteins in cell-cell junctional complexes, including the tight junction (TJ) 2The abbreviations used are: TJtight junctionAPDCammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamateCdxcaudal-related homeoboxIBDinflammatory bowel diseaseJAMjunctional adhesion moleculeMLCKmyosin light chain kinaseTERtransepithelial electrical resistanceZOzonula occludens.

The TJ is a multi-protein complex, located around the apical end of the lateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells, which selectively regulates the paracellular passage of ions, molecules and water. Four types of integral transmembrane proteins, occludin (2Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J.

Sasaki H. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), have been identified so far. These transmembrane proteins interact with intracellular plaque proteins such as zonula occludens (ZO) proteins and cingluin, which in turn anchor the transmembrane proteins to the perijunctional actin cytoskeleton (1González-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Nava P. Jaramillo B.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 81: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). The interaction of TJ proteins with the actin cytoskeleton is vital for maintaining TJ structure and function. Numerous studies have reported that TJ permeability and TJ protein expression/cytoskeletal association are dynamically regulated by various intracellular signaling molecules, such as PKC (6Suzuki T.

Under pathophysiological conditions, the disturbance of the epithelial barrier allows contact with, or even penetration of, noxious luminal contents such as antigens or bacteria into the intestinal immune system resulting in mucosal inflammation, as is the case in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Although the pathogenesis of the barrier defect in IBD is still unclear, studies conducted in cell cultures and animal models demonstrate that some proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α (11Wang F.

However, changes in cytokine profile in inflammatory conditions are complicated, and the effects of other cytokines on barrier function require further investigation. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine whose expression is important for the host response to a number of infections, exerts antigen-specific immune responses, and has both pro- as well as anti-inflammatory effects (16Alonzi T. Fattori E. Lazzaro D. Costa P. Probert L. Kollias G. De Benedetti F. Poli V. Ciliberto G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 17Tilg H. Dinarello C.A.

In pathological states, excessive secretion and dysregulation of IL-6 and its signaling pathway may play a major role in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including IBD (18Kusugami K. Fukatsu A.

IL-6 is produced in substantially higher amounts in both the serum and tissues of IBD patients. In mice, the knock-out and blockade of IL-6 and IL-6 receptor suppress experimental colitis, indicating an important contribution of IL-6 and the IL-6 trans-signaling pathways for progression of IBD (21Yamamoto M.

Lutz H.H. Müller W. Tacke F. Trautwein C. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 3586-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The major source of IL-6 seen in IBD has been shown to be intestinal epithelial cells and lamina propria mononuclear cells (18Kusugami K. Fukatsu A. Tanimoto M. Shinoda M. Haruta J. Kuroiwa A. Ina K. Kanayama K. Ando T. Matsuura T. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1995; 40: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, the role of IL-6 in the regulation of intestinal barrier function remains poorly understood. The claudin family consists of at least 24 members (1González-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Nava P. Jaramillo B.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 81: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). In contrast to their structural similarities, the claudins perform different functions and can roughly be divided into two types, those involved in barrier formation, and those important in channel formation (25Colegio O.R. Van Itallie C.M. McCrea H.J. Rahner C. Anderson J.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 283: C142-C147Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). For example, claudin-1 is crucial for tightening the barrier in renal epithelial cells and mammalian epidermis (26Furuse M. Hata M. Furuse K. Yoshida Y. Haratake A. Sugitani Y. Noda T. Kubo A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1099-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar, 27Inai T. Kobayashi J. Shibata Y. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In contrast, claudin-2 expression decreases the tightness of the epithelial barrier, which, it has been suggested, is mediated by a paracellular channel for small cations (28Amasheh S. Meiri N. Gitter A.H. Schöneberg T. Mankertz J. Schulzke J.D. Fromm M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4969-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). It has been reported that claudin-2 expression is markedly increased in the colons of patients suffering from Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, and it seems to have an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD (29Prasad S. Mingrino R. Kaukinen K. Hayes K.L. Powell R.M. MacDonald T.T. Collins J.E. Lab. Invest. 2005; 85: 1139-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide evidence that IL-6 has a role in the regulation of intestinal epithelial TJs. Our results demonstrate that IL-6 induces claudin-2 expression through signaling pathways involving MEK/ERK and PI3K, and transcriptional factor Cdx2 expression. The following antibodies were used in this study; rabbit polyclonal anti-claudin-1, anti-claudin-2, anti-claudin-3, anti-JAM-1, anti-ZO-1, and anti-ZO-2, mouse anti-claudin-4, and HRP-conjugated anti-occludin (Life Technologies); rabbit polyclonal anti-Cdx2 and rabbit monoclonal anti-pERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), pSTAT3 (Tyr-705), pAkt (Ser-473), and mouse monoclonal anti-ERK1/2 and HA-Tag (Cell Signaling Technology); mouse monoclonal anti-gp130 (R&D Systems); mouse anti-β-actin and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse and -rabbit IgG (Sigma); AlexaFluor 488 conjugated goat polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor 546 conjugated goat polyclonal anti-mouse IgG (Life Technologies). The following signaling inhibitors were used in this study; U0126 (a MEK inhibitor), LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor), PP2 (a Src inhibitor), AG490 (a JAK inhibitor), ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (APDC, a NFκB inhibitor) were purchased from Calbiochem. All other chemicals were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries. Caco-2 (HTB-37) and T84 intestinal epithelial cells (CCL-248) purchased from American Type Cell Culture were grown under standard cell culture conditions as described (6Suzuki T. Seth A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3574-3583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 7Suzuki T. Elias B.C. Seth A. Shen L. Turner J.R. Giorgianni F. Desiderio D. Guntaka R. Rao R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on polyester membranes in Transwell and Snapwell inserts (12-mm; Corning) for 14 (Caco-2) or 7 (T84) days prior to experiments. Recombinant human IL-6 (0∼100 ng/ml; Miltenyie Biotech) was applied to the basal aspect of cells. Cell monolayers were incubated with anti-gp130 (5 and 10 μg/ml), AG490 (1 and 3 μm), U0126 (5 and 10 μm), LY294002 (12 and 25 μm), PP2 (3 and 10 μm), and APDC (10 and 30 μm) 0.5 h before IL-6 administration. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) as an indicator of TJ permeability to ionic solutes, and unidirectional flux of FITC-conjugated dextran as an indicator of TJ permeability to uncharged macromolecules were assessed in Caco-2 and T84 cell monolayers. TER was measured as described previously (6Suzuki T. Seth A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3574-3583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 7Suzuki T. Elias B.C.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) using a Millicell-ERS Electrical Resistance System (Millipore) at varying times during the experiment. Cell monolayers were incubated in the presence of FITC-dextran (4 kDa, 100 μm) in the apical well and the fluorescence in the basal well was determined using a fluorescence plate reader (ARVO X4, Perkin Elmer). The NaCl dilution potential in Caco-2 cells on Snapwell inserts were measured using a vertical diffusion chamber system (Harvard Apparatus). Each chamber was filled with 6 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 5.6 mm d-glucose and 4 mm l-glutamine. The chambers were kept at 37 °C, and 100% O2 was bubbled through the solutions. The transepithelial potential was measured using 3 m-KCl electrode and voltage-clamping device (CEZ9100, Nihon Kohden). The NaCl dilution potential was determined from the shift in the reversal potential after replacing basal solution with one in which 130 mm mannitol was substituted for the 65 mm NaCl (15Weber C.R.

The permeability ratio, PNa+/PCl−, was determined using Godlmann-Hodgkin-Katz equation as described previously (30Günzel D. Stuiver M. Kausalya P.J. Haisch L. Krug S.M. Rosenthal R. Meij I.C. Hunziker W. Fromm M. Müller D. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Liquid junction potentials measured using empty Snapwell inserts were <0.1 mV. Cell viability was monitored by assaying mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity (WST-8, Dojindo) after IL-6 treatment. A MEK1WT-HA in pMCL vector was kindly provided from Dr Natalie Ahn (University of Colorado) (31Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). Caco-2 cells were seeded on 6-well plates a day before transfection. The cells were transfected using 1 ml of antibiotics-free DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1 μg of DNA plasmid (empty and MEK1WT-HA vectors), 1 μl of Plus reagent, and 3 μl of Lipofectamine-LTX (Life Technologies) for each well. After 20 h, the cell monolayers were trypsinized and seeded in Transwell inserts. Male BALB/c mice (6-week-old) were purchased from Clea Japan. Recombinant mouse IL-6 (6 μg/mouse; Biolegend) was injected intraperitoneally 16 h prior to tissue harvest. PBS was used as the control treatment. The animal study was approved by the Hiroshima University Animal Committee, and the mice were maintained in accordance with the Hiroshima University guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Detergent-insoluble fractions and whole cell extracts were prepared as previously described. The detergent insoluble fraction corresponds to the actin cytoskeleton-associated proteins. For preparations of detergent-insoluble fractions, Caco-2 cell monolayers were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated for 5 min at 4 °C with 200 μl of lysis buffer-CS (1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EGTA in 50 mm Tris containing protease inhibitors (5 mg/liter aprotinin, 3 mg/liter leupeptin hemisulfate, 5 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, and 1 mm PMSF) and phosphatase inhibitors (25 mm glycerol-2-phosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm sodium fluoride, pH 7.4). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to precipitate the high-density actin-rich fraction. Pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer D (0.3% SDS, 10 mm Tris, and the protease and phosphatase inhibitors described above, pH 7.4). For preparation of the whole Caco-2 cell extracts, 200 μl of lysis buffer D was used after washing cell monolayers with ice-cold PBS. Mouse colon tissue (50 mg) was homogenized in 1 ml lysis buffer D using a polytron-type homogenizer. Protein concentrations in the different fractions were measured using the BCA method (Pierce Biotechnology). Cell extracts were mixed with a half volume of Laemmli sample buffer (3× concentrated; 6% (w:v) SDS, 30% (v:v) glycerol, 15% (v:v) 2-β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% (w:v) bromphenol blue in 188 mm Tris, pH 6.8) and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. Proteins (20 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blotted for ZO-1, ZO-2, JAM-1, claudin-1, claudin-2, claudin-3, claudin-4, Cdx2, pSTAT3, pERK1/2, pAkt, and β-actin, using specific antibodies in combination with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. HRP-conjugated anti-occludin antibody was used for immunoblot analysis of occludin. The blots were developed using the ECL chemiluminescence method (GE Healthcare). Quantification was performed by densitometric analysis of specific bands on the immunoblots using Image J software. Caco-2 cell monolayers were washed with ice-cold PBS, fixed in methanol at 0 °C for 5 min, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Cell monolayers were blocked in 4% nonfat milk in TBST (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, pH7.4) and incubated for 1 h with rabbit polyclonal anti-claudin-2, ZO-1, Cdx2, and mouse monoclonal anti-HA tag, gp130, and gp80 antibodies followed by incubation for 1 h with secondary antibodies (goat AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor 546-conjugated anti-mouse IgG) with DAPI. Mouse colon tissue was embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek Japan) after fixation with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Frozen sections (8 μm in thickness) were prepared on glass slides and washed with PBS. The sections were blocked in 5% normal goat serum and incubated for 1 h with rabbit polyclonal anti-claudin-2, followed by incubation for 1 h with goat AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, rhodamine-conjugated phalloidine and DAPI. The specimens were preserved in a mounting medium, and the fluorescence was visualized using Nikon ECLIPSE E600 fluorescence microscope (Nikon) and Olympus FW1000 confocal microscope (Olympus). The total RNA of Caco-2 cells was isolated using TRI reagent (Sigma), and reverse-transcribed with ReverTra Ace® qPCR RT kit (TOYOBO) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Life Technologies) and KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR kit (KAPA BIOSYSTEMS). The primer sequences used for PCR are shown in supplemental Table S1. Reactions were performed at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 3 s and 60 °C for 30 s. The dissociation stage was analyzed at 95 °C for 15 s, followed by one cycle of 60 °C for 15 s and 95 °C for 15 s. The fluorescence of the SYBR green dye was determined as a function of the PCR cycle number, giving the threshold cycle number at which amplification reached a significant threshold. Data were analyzed by the ΔΔCt method and presented as fold changes in gene expression after normalization to the internal control β-actin gene expression level. Genomic DNA was purified from Caco-2 cells using TRI reagent. The 5′ region (−1067 to −1) of the human Claudin-2 gene was amplified by PCR with gene-specific primers (forward/reverse) 5′-GAATCTTGGCAACACCGAGG-3′/5′-GGCAGACCTCTCAGTAGAAG-3′, inserted into the pGEM-T vector (Promega), and sequenced. The Claudin-2 promoter fragment with MluI and BglII sites was subcloned into the pGL3 Basic vector (Promega). In the promoter sequence, 6 putative transcription factor binding sites (4 sites for Cdx, a site for STAT, and a site for NFκB) were detected by TFSEARCH (Real World Computing Partnership). Deletion mutants for the putative transcription factor binding sites (Cdx, STAT, and NFκB) were introduced into the WT-claudin-2 promoter sequence using the KOD-Plus Mutagenesis kit (TOYOBO). The primer sequences used for mutagenesis are shown in supplemental Table S2. An hClaudin-2 promoter in a pGL3 vector driving luciferase expression was transfected to Caco-2 cells. Luciferase activity in cell lysates was assayed by the Luciferase assay system (Promega). Statistical analyses were performed using a one-way ANOVA approach followed by a Tukey-Kramer multiple range test using the general linear models procedure of the Statistical Analysis Systems program (version 6.07; SAS Institute Inc). A difference of p < 0.05 was considered significant. The degree of tightness of the TJ can be evaluated by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER, an indicator of TJ permeability to ionic solutes) and dextran flux (an indicator of TJ permeability to uncharged macromolecules). In Caco-2 cell monolayers, IL-6 decreased the TER in both a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner, indicating increased TJ permeability to ionic solutes (Fig. 1, A and B), without eliciting any changes to the permeance of the nonionic macromolecule 4 kDa dextran (Fig. 1C). Fig. 1A shows that the addition of ≥ 2.5 ng/ml IL-6 to the culture medium for 48 h induced significant decreases in the TER, and that the TER decreased to ∼70% of pretreatment level in the presence of 10 ng/ml IL-6. Fig. 1B shows that the TER readings taken after treatment with 5 ng/ml IL-6 at 24, 48, and 72 h, and after treatment with 10 ng/ml IL-6 at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, were lower than the control values at each time point. Although the induction of apoptosis is known to decrease the TER, IL-6 (∼50 ng/ml) did not affect the cell viability (Fig. 1D). IL-6 also decreased the TER in another intestinal epithelial T84 cells in a similar manner to the Caco-2 cells, indicating that the IL-6-induced effect is not confined to the Caco-2 cells (supplemental Fig. S1). To determine the ion selectivity of Caco-2 cell monolayers incubated without or with IL-6, the dilution potentials were measured under an apicobasal chemical gradient of NaCl (Fig. 1, E–G). Fig. 1, E and F show that the treatment with 10 ng/ml IL-6 increased the NaCl dilution potential in the Caco-2 cells. As calculated from the dilution potential by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation, permeability of Na+ relative to Cl− (PNa+/PCl−) was increased by IL6 treatment (Fig. 1G). Because intestinal TJ permeability is regulated by TJ structure, we examined the effect of IL-6 on both the total expression of TJ proteins and on TJ proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Treatment of cells with 10 ng/ml IL-6 for 48 h increased claudin-2 protein expression in whole cell extracts and detergent-insoluble fractions (which corresponds to the actin cytoskeletal fraction) but did not affect the levels of other TJ proteins (ZO-1, ZO-2, occludin, JAM-1, claudin-1, claudin-3, or claudin-4) (Fig. 2A). It is known that claudin-2 expression decreases the tightness of the intestinal TJ barrier, due to the fact that claudin-2 forms paracellular cation channels. Furthermore, IL-6 had no effect on the expression of E-cadherin, MLCK, or on MLC phosphorylation (Fig. 2B), indicating that IL-6 is unlikely to regulate adherence junctions or cytoskeletal contraction. Fig. 2, C and D show increases in total claudin-2 protein levels in response to IL-6, occurring both dose-dependently and time-dependently. Treatment with 2.5, 5.0, 10, and 50 ng/ml IL-6 for 48 h significantly elevated claudin-2 protein expression (Fig. 2C). Increases in claudin-2 expression in response to 10 ng/ml IL-6 became apparent 6 h after treatment, but the most pronounced increases were observed at 24 and 48 h (Fig. 2D). The IL-6-induced claudin-2 expression was also observed in the T84 cell monolayers (supplemental Fig. S1). Increases in claudin-2 protein expression in response to IL-6 were confirmed using immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2E). IL-6 enhanced the signal intensity of immunolabeled claudin-2, but not of ZO-1, in the junctional region of Caco-2 cell monolayers. To assess transcriptional regulation, claudin-2 mRNA was quantified by qPCR. Fig. 2E demonstrates that IL-6 treatment led to an increase in claudin-2 mRNA levels. These results show that the IL-6-induced increase in TJ permeability to Na+ is due to elevated claudin-2 expression in Caco-2 cells. To investigate whether IL-6 induced claudin-2 expression in vivo, we evaluated claudin-2 expression in mouse colons 16 h after IL-6 injection. Immunoblot analysis revealed that claudin-2 levels in the colons of mice injected with IL-6 were higher than those of the control mice (Fig. 3A). Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that claudin-2 expression was concentrated in the crypt epithelial cells of control mice, as previously reported (15Weber C.R. Raleigh D.R. Su L. Shen L. Sullivan E.A. Wang Y. Turner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 12037-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and the signal intensity was markedly increased after IL-6 injection (Fig. 3B). We then explored possible signaling pathways involved in IL-6-mediated increases in TJ permeability and claudin-2 expression. It has been reported that the binding of IL-6 to IL-6 receptor (gp80) induces the homodimerization of gp130, a signal-transducing subunit, which triggers several different signaling pathways including JAK/STAT, MEK/ERK, PI3K/Akt, cSrc, and NFκB. Fig. 4A shows that the IL-6-mediated decrease in TER was suppressed by anti-gp130, U0126 (a MEK inhibitor), LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor), and PP2 (a cSrc inhibitor), but not by AG490 (a JAK inhibitor) or APDC (a NFκB inhibitor) in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4B) further demonstrated that IL-6-induced claudin-2 expression was highly sensitive to the inhibition of gp130, MEK, and PI3K, but not cSrc. The results show that IL-6 induced the phosphorylation of STAT3, ERK1/2, and Akt (Fig. 4C), which were specifically or totally prevented by each inhibitor or anti-gp130 (Fig. 4D). Because of the possibility that MEK activation may have a primary role in IL-6-induced claudin-2 expression, Caco-2 cells were transiently transfected with MEK1wt-HA plasmid and triple-labeled for claudin-2 (green), MEK1-HA (red), and total DNA (blue), as shown in Fig. 4E. Cells expressing MEK1wt-HA demonstrated both enhanced expression and junctional distribution of claudin-2, while transfection of the control vector did not affect claudin-2 expression. These results indicate that the IL-6-mediated activation of the MEK/ERK and PI3K pathways, via gp130 subunit/IL-6Rα interaction, leads to enhanced claudin-2 expression res"
https://openalex.org/W2148721608,"Aberrant microglial activation has been proposed to contribute to the cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease (AD), but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain enigmatic. Fractalkine signaling, a pathway mediating the communication between microglia and neurons, is deficient in AD brains and down-regulated by amyloid-β. Although fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) on microglia was found to regulate plaque load, no functional effects have been reported. Our study demonstrates that CX3CR1 deficiency worsens the AD-related neuronal and behavioral deficits. The effects were associated with cytokine production but not with plaque deposition. Ablation of CX3CR1 in mice overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein enhanced Tau pathology and exacerbated the depletion of calbindin in the dentate gyrus. The levels of calbindin in the dentate gyrus correlated negatively with those of tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 6, suggesting neurotoxic effects of inflammatory factors. Functionally, removing CX3CR1 in human amyloid precursor protein mice worsened the memory retention in passive avoidance and novel object recognition tests, and their memory loss in the novel object recognition test is associated with high levels of interleukin 6. Our findings identify CX3CR1 as a key microglial pathway in protecting against AD-related cognitive deficits that are associated with aberrant microglial activation and elevated inflammatory cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W1981979006,"Inorganic polyphosphate (poly-P) consists of just a chain of phosphate groups linked by high energy bonds. It is found in every organism and is implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes (e.g. phosphate storage, blood coagulation, and pathogenicity). Its metabolism has been studied mainly in bacteria while remaining largely uncharacterized in eukaryotes. It has recently been suggested that poly-P metabolism is connected to that of highly phosphorylated inositol species (inositol pyrophosphates). Inositol pyrophosphates are molecules in which phosphate groups outnumber carbon atoms. Like poly-P they contain high energy bonds and play important roles in cell signaling. Here, we show that budding yeast mutants unable to produce inositol pyrophosphates have undetectable levels of poly-P. Our results suggest a prominent metabolic parallel between these two highly phosphorylated molecules. More importantly, we demonstrate that DDP1, encoding diadenosine and diphosphoinositol phosphohydrolase, possesses a robust poly-P endopolyphosphohydrolase activity. In addition, we prove that this is an evolutionarily conserved feature because mammalian Nudix hydrolase family members, the three Ddp1 homologues in human cells (DIPP1, DIPP2, and DIPP3), are also capable of degrading poly-P."

Yet, how XLF binds XRCC4 and impacts nonhomologous end joining functions has been enigmatic. Here, we report the XLF-XRCC4 complex crystal structure in combination with biophysical and mutational analyses to define the XLF-XRCC4 interactions. Crystal and solution structures plus mutations characterize alternating XRCC4 and XLF head domain interfaces forming parallel super-helical filaments. XLF Leu-115 (""Leu-lock"") inserts into a hydrophobic pocket formed by XRCC4 Met-59, Met-61, Lys-65, Lys-99, Phe-106, and Leu-108 in synergy with pseudo-symmetric β-zipper hydrogen bonds to drive specificity. XLF C terminus and DNA enhance parallel filament formation. Super-helical XLF-XRCC4 filaments form a positively charged channel to bind DNA and align ends for efficient ligation.

https://openalex.org/W2007026131,"SLC6A14, also known as ATB(0,+), is an amino acid transporter with unique characteristics. It transports 18 of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids. However, this transporter is expressed only at low levels in normal tissues. Here, we show that the transporter is up-regulated specifically in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, demonstrable with primary human breast cancer tissues and human breast cancer cell lines. SLC6A14 is an estrogen/ER target. The transport features of SLC6A14 include concentrative transport of leucine (an activator of mTOR), glutamine (an essential amino acid for nucleotide biosynthesis and substrate for glutaminolysis), and arginine (an essential amino acid for tumor cells), suggesting that ER-positive breast cancer cells up-regulate SLC6A14 to meet their increased demand for these amino acids. Consequently, treatment of ER-positive breast cancer cells in vitro with α-methyl-DL-tryptophan (α-MT), a selective blocker of SLC6A14, induces amino acid deprivation, inhibits mTOR, and activates autophagy. Prolongation of the treatment with α-MT causes apoptosis. Addition of an autophagy inhibitor (3-methyladenine) during α-MT treatment also induces apoptosis. These effects of α-MT are specific to ER-positive breast cancer cells, which express the transporter. The ability of α-MT to cause amino acid deprivation is significantly attenuated in MCF-7 cells, an ER-positive breast cancer cell line, when SLC6A14 is silenced with shRNA. In mouse xenograft studies, α-MT by itself is able to reduce the growth of the ER-positive ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells. These studies identify SLC6A14 as a novel and effective drug target for the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1979530771,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS), continuously generated as by-products of respiration, inflict more damage on the mitochondrial (mt) than on the nuclear genome because of the nonchromatinized nature and proximity to the ROS source of the mitochondrial genome.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e61Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The mtDNA encodes essential subunits of the respiratory chain, tRNA and rRNAs, all of which are critical for maintaining oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (3Anderson S. Bankier A.T.

Nature. 1981; 290: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (7684) Google Scholar). OXPHOS accounts for about 85% of oxygen consumed by the cell, and early reports estimated that under physiological conditions ∼5% of consumed oxygen is partially reduced to ROS (4Turrens J.F. J.

Although recent reports indicate a much lower level of ROS production in normal cells, even a low and persistent ROS level has long term detrimental effects (5Staniek K. Nohl H. Biochim. Biophys.

Thus, the mitochondria, the major cellular site for ROS generation, are under continuous oxidative stress that results in oxidative damage to DNA, as well as proteins and lipids (7Cadenas E.

ROS-induced DNA damage includes multitude of mutagenic oxidized bases and single-strand breaks (SSBs) containing 3′- and 5′-blocking groups in DNA, which are generated both directly or as intermediates during BER (8Wallace S.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 9Caldecott K.W. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 619-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Because of close proximity of the site of ROS generation and nonchromatinized state of the mt genome, the mutation rate in human mtDNA is 20–100-fold higher relative to the nDNA (10Pesole G. Gissi C. De Chirico A. Saccone C. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). As summarized in recent reviews (11Almeida K.H. Sobol R.W. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 695-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 12Fortini P. Dogliotti E. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 398-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 13Hegde M.L. Hazra T.K. Mitra S. Cell Res. 2008; 18: 27-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), repair of oxidized base lesions or abnormal bases is initiated with their excision by a DNA glycosylase. A monofunctional glycosylase, such as uracil-DNA glycosylase, excises U from the DNA to generate an abasic (AP) site, which is then cleaved by AP endonuclease (APE1) in mammalian cells to generate 3′-OH and nonligatable 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) residues. In the nucleus, the 5′-dRP could be removed by DNA polymerase β (pol β) via its intrinsic dRP lyase activity. In the mitochondria, the DNA polymerase γ (pol γ) with similar dRP lyase activity is also able to remove the dRP moiety (14Longley M.J. Prasad R. Srivastava D.K. Wilson S.H. Copeland W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 12244-12248Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In the case of oxidized base repair by DNA glycosylases with intrinsic AP lyase activity, such as 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (OGG1), base excision is coupled to strand cleavage at the AP site with generation of 5′-phosphate and 3′-blocking phospho-α,β-unsaturated aldehyde that is subsequently removed by the intrinsic 3′-phosphodiesterase activity of APE1. This leaves a 3′-OH that serves as the primer terminus for DNA repair synthesis. However, the absence of an aldehyde group in oxidized deoxyribose fragment at the 5′ terminus after the DNA strand break, as in the case of oxidized AP sites, precludes their removal by the dRP lyase activity of pol β and γ in the nucleus and mitochondria, respectively. In such a case, the 5′-blocking group in nDNA together with additional nucleotides are removed by flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), a 5′-exo/endonuclease. Thus, the resulting gap filling by a DNA polymerase and nick sealing by DNA ligase during BER could proceed via two subpathways as follows: single nucleotide-BER, where only the damage base is replaced, or long patch (LP)-BER, where 2–6 additional nucleotides at the 5′ terminus are removed by a 5′-exo/endonuclease followed by resynthesis. In the nucleus, DNA ligase3 (lig3) is involved in single nucleotide-BER after pol β fills in the single nucleotide gap. FEN1-mediated gap is likely to be filled in by replicative DNA polymerases δ/ϵ followed by nick sealing with DNA ligase1 (lig1), although pol β has also been implicated (15Liu Y. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 589-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In contrast to the situation in the nucleus with multiple DNA polymerases and ligases, their sole mt counterparts, pol γ and lig3, are responsible for both replication and repair of mtDNA (16Pinz K.G. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Only single nucleotide-BER activity was known in the mitochondria until we and others discovered LP-BER activity in mt extract of mammalian cells; however, the identity of the mt 5′ end-processing exo/endonuclease was not settled (17Stierum R.H.

We detected the presence of an unknown 5′-exo/endonuclease activity in mt extract of mammalian cells that generated short (2–4 nucleotides) fragments, distinct from those generated by FEN1 (18Szczesny B.

Subsequently DNA2, a helicase/nuclease, which plays various roles in the processing of nDNA intermediates during replication and repair in yeast, was shown to be present in the human mitochondria and was proposed to process 5′-flap intermediates in DNA, synergistically with FEN1 during mtDNA replication and LP-BER (21Zheng L.

In addition, another 5′-exo/endonuclease, EXOG, which localized exclusively in mitochondria, was identified as a paralog of endonuclease G (EndoG), with nuclease activity toward single-strand DNA; however, its role in the maintenance of mt genome was not determined (22Cymerman I.A. Chung I. Beckmann B.M. Bujnicki J.M. Meiss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 1369-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the role of the three mt 5′-exo/endonucleases and have shown that EXOG but not FEN1 nor DNA2 provides the critical 5′-exonuclease activity for mt BER/SSBR. EXOG depletion causing accumulation of persistent SSBs in the mt, but not in nu genome, increases oxidative stress and induces mt dysfunction, thereby activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. More importantly, we have shown for a first time that persistent SSBs in the mt genome alone trigger apoptosis in mammalian cells, which is suppressed in cells deficient in mtDNA. Those results underscore the importance of mt genome integrity in cell survival. The human lines HeLa, MCF7, and HCT 116 (p53+/+) were grown in DMEM and McCoy's media, respectively. A549 cells were grown in F-12 medium.

To optimize the siRNA concentration for maximal target depletion, preliminary transfections were carried out with 10–100 nm for each siRNA. The level of depletion was calculated by densitometric analysis of Western blots relative to loading control of three independent experiments using Gel Logic 2200 and Molecular Imaging software (Kodak). The mRNA depletion of individual nucleases was evaluated by RT-PCR using OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) per the manufacturer's recommendations, and the following pairs of primers were used: EXOG 5′-TTT TCT GAG CGG CTT CG T-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGA TCT TTT CCA GTC TGA GCA-3 (antisense); FEN1 5′-CCT GGC CAA ACT AAT TGC TGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCC CCT TTT AAA CTT CCC TG-3 (antisense); DNA2 5′-TCC GCT CTG CTG TTG ACA ATA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCA GTT TAT GTT TGG CTC TGG-3 (antisense). Preliminary assays were carried out to ensure the linearity of PCR amplification with respect to number of cycles and RNA concentration. Early apoptotic, late apoptotic, and necrotic populations were characterized using the annexin V-PE apoptosis detection kit (Pharmingen) per the manufacturer's protocol. MitoSOX Red (Molecular Probes) was used to assess the level of superoxide anion generated in the mitochondria, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Mt membrane depolarization was analyzed using the MitoProbe JC-1 assay kit (Molecular Probes). In all cases, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCanto (BD Biosciences) at the University of Texas Medical Branch Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Core). Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate were measured using a Seahorse XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA) as described previously (26Qian W. Van Houten B. Methods. 2010; 51: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, on the day before extracellular flux analysis, siRNA-transfected MCF7 cells were trypsinized and subcultured in an XF24 cell culture plate at 4 × 104 cells/well and incubated in 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for overnight. The cells were then washed, and the growth medium was replaced with unbuffered DMEM. After incubating cells for another 60 min in a 37 °C incubator without CO2, the OCR and extracellular acidification rate measurements were performed simultaneously. Gene-specific semi-quantitative PCR assays for measuring DNA damage were performed as described earlier (27Santos J.H. Meyer J.N. Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B. Methods Mol.

Preliminary assays were carried out to ensure the linearity of PCR amplification with respect to the number of cycles and DNA concentration. Damage to mtDNA was normalized to mt genome copy number determined by amplification of a 211-bp fragment. The DNA repair assay was carried out as described earlier (18Szczesny B. Tann A.W.

Briefly, the 20-μl assay mixture contained 20 μm each of four unlabeled dNTPs, 4 μCi of [α-32P]dATP, mitochondrial or nuclear protein extract (5–10 μg), and duplex oligonucleotide substrate in assay buffer. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the products were separated from the substrates by electrophoresis in a 20% acrylamide, 7 m urea gel. The radioactivity in these bands was quantitated in a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare) using ImageQuant software. Preliminary enzyme assays were carried out to ensure the linearity of the reaction with respect to both time and the amount of extract. To rule out strand displacement during LP-BER, we also performed repair assay using 3′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide (18Szczesny B. Tann A.W. Longley M.J. Copeland W.C. Mitra S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26349-26356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The specific activity of AP endonuclease was calculated as reported previously (29Izumi T. Mitra S. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 525-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recombinant EXOG was purified, and its specific activity was determined using gap- and flap-specific substrates as described earlier (18Szczesny B. Tann A.W. Longley M.J. Copeland W.C. Mitra S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26349-26356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 30Kieper J. Lauber C. Gimadutdinow O. Urbańska A. Cymerman I. Ghosh M. Szczesny B. Meiss G. Protein Exp. Purif. 2010; 73: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). At least three independent experiments were carried out in duplicate or triplicate for each assay. The results are presented as means ± S.E. and analyzed for statistical significance with one-way analysis of variance. To evaluate the role of mt 5′-exo/endonucleases, we used appropriate siRNAs to individually knock down EXOG, FEN1, and DNA2 to 10–20% of their endogenous levels at 48 h post-transfection in HeLa and HCT 116 (p53+/+) cells. The reduction in enzyme and mRNA levels was calculated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and densitometric analysis of Western blots (Fig. 1, A and B). Massive cell death was observed only after depleting EXOG, but not FEN1 nor DNA2, as assessed by plasma membrane permeability and externalization of phosphatidylserine. Such analysis discriminates early apoptotic (annexin V-positive, 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD)-negative) from late apoptotic (annexin V-positive, 7-AAD-positive) or necrotic (annexin V-negative, 7-AAD-positive) cell populations (31Patel V.A.

Cell. 2007; 25: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). We observed a significant increase in the levels of early and late apoptotic but not necrotic cell populations at 48 h post-transfection in EXOG-depleted cells for both lines, but not after depleting FEN1 nor DNA2 (Fig. 1, C and D, and supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). Only prolonged (4-day) incubation with FEN1-siRNA caused apoptosis (data not shown), presumably due to the essential role of FEN1 in maintaining integrity of the nu genome and thus cell survival (19Liu P. Qian L. Sung J.S. de Souza-Pinto N.C. Zheng L. Bogenhagen D.F. Bohr V.A. Wilson 3rd, D.M. Shen B. Demple B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4975-4987Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, we did not detect any type of cell death after DNA2 depletion, even after longer (4-day) siRNA treatment (data not shown). Although mtDNA replication is independent of the cell cycle (33Falkenberg M. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 679-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of depletion of each of the three 5′-exo/endonucleases on the level of BrdU incorporation into DNA of HCT cells stained with 7-AAD at 48 h after siRNA transfection (34Lizard G. Miguet C. Gueldry S. Monier S. Gambert P. Ann. Pathol. 1997; 17: 61-66PubMed Google Scholar). Significant increase (∼5-fold) in the sub-G1 cell population was observed only after depletion of EXOG compared with the control (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B), which further supports our conclusion that EXOG depletion activates cell death. Apoptosis typically occurs via the intrinsic or extrinsic pathways, which in turn activate the executioner caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-7, respectively (35Taylor R.C. Cullen S.P. Martin S.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar). Intrinsic apoptotic pathway usually involves loss of mt transmembrane potential and change in ROS generation (36Tait S.W. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 621-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar, 37Bratton S.B. Walker G. Srinivasula S.M. Sun X.M. Butterworth M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). We tested how EXOG deficiency activated the apoptotic pathway at various times after siRNA transfection of HeLa cells. The EXOG level was reduced by 50% at 12 h after siRNA transfection and by 80–90% after 36–48 h (Fig. 2A). This was accompanied by a significant decrease in the procaspase-9 level at 36 and 48 h post-transfection, together with activation of caspase-3 but not of caspase-8 (Fig. 2A). In addition, the 24-kDa poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage product, an apoptosis hallmark (38Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22932-22940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), was detected at 36 and 48 h after EXOG depletion (Fig. 2A). Increase in early apoptotic cells could be observed at 24 h after EXOG-siRNA transfection and late apoptosis at 36 h (Fig. 2B). The lack of an off-target effect in activation of caspase-3 was tested by co-expression siRNA-resistant EXOG, which prevented caspase-3 activation (data not shown). Depolarization of the mt membrane potential significantly increased at 36 and 48 h after transfection compared with control after depletion of EXOG but not of FEN1 nor DNA2 (supplemental Fig. 3, B–D). Moreover, superoxide generation, presumably due to the loss of mt membrane potential (40Kroemer G. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 44-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar), was observed only in EXOG-depleted cells but not FEN1- nor DNA2-depleted cells (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. 4, A and B). These results indicate that EXOG depletion causes a loss of mt functions, which in turn activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. To test whether EXOG depletion affects mt function, we knocked down EXOG in MCF7 cells and studied oxygen consumption using a Seahorse Flux analyzer. This instrument simultaneously measures the OCR, a measure of OXPHOS, and extracellular acidification rate, a measure of lactate production via glycolysis (26Qian W. Van Houten B. Methods. 2010; 51: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). MCF7 breast cancer cells were chosen for these experiments because of their caspase-3 deficiency (41Yang X.H. Sladek T.L. Liu X. Butler B.R. Froelich C.J. Thor A.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 348-354PubMed Google Scholar, 42Yang X.H. Edgerton S. Thor A.D. Int. J. Oncol. 2005; 26: 1675-1680PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore would be expected not to undergo apoptosis following loss of EXOG. Apoptosis could alter oxidative phosphorylation and might obscure any direct effects of EXOG depletion. EXOG knockdown in MCF7 cells reduced basal OCR and ATP-linked OCR by over 2-fold (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. 5). Surprisingly, these cells did not show compensatory increase in glycolysis. These data indicate that loss of EXOG causes a decline in OXPHOS capacity and therefore overall bioenergetics in the cell. To evaluate the contribution of EXOG, FEN1, and DNA2 to the maintenance of mt genomic integrity, we measured the level of damage in mt and nDNA by semi-quantitative PCR of long genomic fragments (27Santos J.H. Meyer J.N. Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 314: 183-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This assay measures the integrity of both mt and nu genome, by quantifying mostly SSBs because the majority of oxidatively damaged base lesions in the genomes are by-passed by DNA polymerases (8Wallace S.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 43Meyer J.N. Ecotoxicology. 2010; 19: 804-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The mitochondrion-specific DNA fragment in EXOG-depleted HeLa cells had 25 and 50% less amplification relative to the control at 24 and 48 h after siRNA transfection, respectively (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. 6A). In contrast, 20% less amplification was observed for a nucleus-specific DNA region in EXOG-depleted cells only at 48 h after siRNA transfection (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. 6A). The level of nDNA damage was further investigated by Comet analysis in alkaline condition of HeLa cell DNA (44Singh N.P. McCoy M.T. Tice R.R. Schneider E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (9117) Google Scholar), which showed no significant increase in the tail moment at 48 h after EXOG-siRNA transfection (supplemental Fig. S7). These results indicate that EXOG depletion causes accumulation of SSBs predominantly in the mt genome. However, FEN1 depletion did not affect the integrity of the mt genome under similar conditions, although accumulation of nDNA damage was observed (Fig. 3, A and B, and supplemental Fig. 6B). We conclude that the primary role of FEN1 is to maintain integrity of the nu genome, as was also suggested earlier (18Szczesny B. Tann A.W. Longley M.J. Copeland W.C. Mitra S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26349-26356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 20Akbari M. Visnes T. Krokan H.E. Otterlei M.

BioEssays. 2005; 27: 717-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Interestingly, DNA2 depletion had no sustained effect on the integrity of the nu genome, although an early increase in mtDNA damage was detected (at 12 h post-transfection), which appears to have been subsequently repaired (Fig. 3, A and B, and supplemental Fig. 6C). These results suggest that DNA2 is also involved in maintaining mt genome integrity, but its deficiency is eventually compensated by EXOG or other yet unknown 5′-exonuclease(s) as suggested earlier (21Zheng L. Zhou M. Guo Z. Lu H. Qian L. Dai H. Qiu J. Yakubovskaya E. Bogenhagen D.F. Demple B. Shen B. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The repair of SSBs containing 5′-blocking oxidized deoxyribose fragments in mtDNA would require 5′ end-processing by one of the 5′-exo/endonucleases, which our results so far indicate to be EXOG. To confirm that EXOG contributes most if not all of the 5′ end-processing activity, we examined repair activity of mt extract for the AP analog tetrahydrofuran (THF) incorporated in a duplex oligonucleotide (18Szczesny B. Tann A.W. Longley M.J. Copeland W.C. Mitra S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26349-26356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). THF is an AP site mimic whose repair is initiated by APE1 to generate 3′-OH and 5′-THF phosphate; the latter is resistant to 5′-AP lyase activity of pol γ. Thus, its removal prior to ligation of strand break would require a 5′-exonuclease. A 52-nt band signifying complete repair was observed with mt extract from control, FEN1-, or DNA2-depleted cells (Fig. 4A). However, a 32–34-nt band, corresponding to the repair intermediate product prior to repair synthesis, was generated with the mt extract from EXOG-depleted cells (Fig. 4A). This indicates that EXOG provides the critical 5′ end-cleaning activity that could not be substituted with FEN1 or DNA2. Thus, EXOG deficiency would generate SSBs as incomplete repair products in the mt genome as we have documented e"
https://openalex.org/W2087954426,"Innate immune response after transient ischemia is the most common cause of myocardial inflammation and may contribute to injury, yet the detailed signaling mechanisms leading to such a response are not well understood. Herein we tested the hypothesis that myocardial ischemia activates interleukin receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1), a kinase critical for the innate immune signaling such as that of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), via a mechanism that involves heat shock proteins (HSPs) and TLRs. Coronary artery occlusion induced a rapid myocardial IRAK-1 activation within 30 min in wild-type (WT), TLR2(-/-), or Trif(-/-) mice, but not in TLR4(def) or MyD88(-/-) mice. HSP60 protein was markedly increased in serum or in perfusate of isolated heart following ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). In vitro, recombinant HSP60 induced IRAK-1 activation in cells derived from WT, TLR2(-/-), or Trif(-/-) mice, but not from TLR4(def) or MyD88(-/-) mice. Both myocardial ischemia- and HSP60-induced IRAK-1 activation was abolished by anti-HSP60 antibody. Moreover, HSP60 treatment of cardiomyocytes (CMs) led to marked activation of caspase-8 and -3, but not -9. Expression of dominant-negative mutant of Fas-associated death domain protein or a caspase-8 inhibitor completely blocked HSP60-induced caspase-8 activation, suggesting that HSP60 likely activates an apoptotic program via the death-receptor pathway. In vivo, I/R-induced myocardial apoptosis and cytokine expression were significantly attenuated in TLR4(def) mice or in WT mice treated with anti-HSP60 antibody compared with WT controls. Taken together, the current study demonstrates that myocardial ischemia activates an innate immune signaling via HSP60 and TLR4, which plays an important role in mediating apoptosis and inflammation during I/R."

Here, we show that among the ATF/CREB family proteins, ATF4 is essential for the circadian expression of the Period2 (Per2) gene, a key component of the circadian clock. Transcription of the Atf4 gene was regulated by core components of the circadian clock, and its expression exhibited circadian oscillation in mouse tissues as well as embryonic fibroblasts. ATF4 bound to the CRE of the Per2 promoter in a circadian time-dependent manner and periodically activated the transcription of the Per2 gene. Consequently, the oscillation of the Per2 expression was attenuated in embryonic cells prepared from Atf4-null mice. Furthermore, the loss of ATF4 also disrupted the rhythms in the expression of other clock genes. These results suggest that ATF4 is a component responsible for sustaining circadian oscillation of CRE-mediated gene expression and also constitute a molecular link connecting cAMP-dependent signaling to the circadian clock."

Each of the three Pcdh clusters shows stochastic and combinatorial expression in individual neurons, thus generating a hugely diverse set of possible cell surface molecules. Therefore, the clustered Pcdhs are candidates for determining neuronal molecular diversity. Here, we showed that the targeted deletion of DNase I hypersensitive (HS) site HS5-1, previously identified as a Pcdh-α regulatory element in vitro, affects especially the expression of specific Pcdh-α isoforms in vivo. We also identified a Pcdh-β cluster control region (CCR) containing six HS sites (HS16, 17, 17′, 18, 19, and 20) downstream of the Pcdh-γ cluster. This CCR comprehensively activates the expression of the Pcdh-β gene cluster in cis, and its deletion dramatically decreases their expression levels. Deleting the CCR nonuniformly down-regulates some Pcdh-γ isoforms and does not affect Pcdh-α expression. Thus, the CCR effect extends beyond the 320-kb region containing the Pcdh-γ cluster to activate the upstream Pcdh-β genes. Thus, we concluded that the CCR is a highly specific regulatory unit for Pcdh-β expression on the clustered Pcdh genomic locus.

https://openalex.org/W2023224492,"The Plasmodium mitochondrial electron transport chain has received considerable attention as a potential target for new antimalarial drugs. Atovaquone, a potent inhibitor of Plasmodium cytochrome bc(1), in combination with proguanil is recommended for chemoprophylaxis and treatment of malaria. The type II NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NDH2) is considered an attractive drug target, as its inhibition is thought to lead to the arrest of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and, as a consequence, pyrimidine biosynthesis, an essential pathway for the parasite. Using the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei as an in vivo infection model, we studied the role of NDH2 during Plasmodium life cycle progression. NDH2 can be deleted by targeted gene disruption and, thus, is dispensable for the pathogenic asexual blood stages, disproving the candidacy for an anti-malarial drug target. After transmission to the insect vector, NDH2-deficient ookinetes display an intact mitochondrial membrane potential. However, ndh2(-) parasites fail to develop into mature oocysts in the mosquito midgut. We propose that Plasmodium blood stage parasites rely on glycolysis as the main ATP generating process, whereas in the invertebrate vector, a glucose-deprived environment, the malaria parasite is dependent on an intact mitochondrial respiratory chain."

To clarify the role of UCPs in mitochondrial Ca2+ handling, we down-regulated the expression of the only uncoupling protein of HeLa cells, UCP3, and measured Ca2+ and ATP levels in the cytosol and in organelles with genetically encoded probes. UCP3 silencing did not alter mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in permeabilized cells. In intact cells, however, UCP3 depletion increased mitochondrial ATP production and strongly reduced the cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ elevations evoked by histamine. The reduced Ca2+ elevations were due to inhibition of store-operated Ca2+ entry and reduced depletion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores. UCP3 depletion accelerated the ER Ca2+ refilling kinetics, indicating that the activity of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ (SERCA) pumps was increased. Accordingly, SERCA inhibitors reversed the effects of UCP3 depletion on cytosolic, ER, and mitochondrial Ca2+ responses. Our results indicate that UCP3 is not a mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter and that it instead negatively modulates the activity of SERCA by limiting mitochondrial ATP production. The effects of UCP3 on mitochondrial Ca2+ thus reflect metabolic alterations that impact on cellular Ca2+ homeostasis.

Mitochondria are multifunctional organelles that control the life and death of cells. Mitochondria are the site of oxidative phosphorylation and convert reducing equivalents into the ATP that cells use as energy source, release critical factors that induce the programmed cell death of apoptosis, and modulate cell signaling by capturing and subsequently releasing calcium ions. The ability of mitochondria to sequester Ca2+ ions released from the endoplasmic reticulum or entering across plasma membrane channels enables these organelles to shape cytosolic Ca2+ signals and to modulate the activity of membrane channels and transporters (1Szabadkai G.

Calcium uptake and release by mitochondria are therefore essential for the patterning of cytosolic Ca2+ signals and for cells to decode Ca2+ signals as either metabolic or death signals.

Ca2+ enters mitochondria across a mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) that was characterized in 2004 at the electrophysiological level as a highly selective inward rectifying mitochondrial inner membrane Ca2+ channel, inhibited by ruthenium red and Ru360 (5Kirichok Y. Krapivinsky G. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2004; 427: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). In 2007, UCP2 and UCP3 were proposed to be fundamental for the MCU (6Trenker M. Malli R. Fertschai I. Levak-Frank S. Graier W.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), based on the altered mitochondrial Ca2+ elevations ([Ca2+]mit) of cells enriched or depleted of UCP2 or UCP3 and on the defective ruthenium red-sensitive Ca2+ uptake of liver mitochondria isolated from UCP2−/− mice. This proposal was subsequently refuted by a study showing that purified liver mitochondria from UCP2−/− and UCP3−/− mice take up calcium normally (7Brookes P.S. Parker N. Buckingham J.A. Vidal-Puig A. Halestrap A.P. Gunter T.E. Nicholls D.G. Bernardi P. Lemasters J.J. Brand M.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10 (author reply 1237–1240): 1235-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In 2009, Letm1, a protein previously shown to catalyze mitochondrial K+/H+ exchange (8Nowikovsky K. Froschauer E.M. Zsurka G. Samaj J. Reipert S. Kolisek M. Wiesenberger G. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol.

Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), was shown to drive mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake by exchanging Ca2+ for H+ with a 1:1 stoichiometry (10Jiang D. Zhao L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2009; 326: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). This stoichiometry, however, contradicts earlier studies in isolated mitochondria showing that Ca2+ enters mitochondria together with two positive charges and leaves the matrix in exchange for three protons (reviewed in Ref. 4Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Letm1 is associated with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, a severe human neurological disease characterized by mental retardation and seizures (11Endele S. Fuhry M. Pak S.J. Zabel B.U. Winterpacht A. Genomics. 1999; 60: 218-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In 2010, MICU1, an inner mitochondrial membrane protein with two Ca2+-binding EF-hand domains, was shown to be required for high capacity mitochondrial calcium uptake (12Perocchi F. Gohil V.M. Girgis H.S. Bao X.R. McCombs J.E. Palmer A.E. Mootha V.K. Nature. 2010; 467: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). MICU1 is a single-pass transmembrane protein unlikely to form a channel pore and was proposed to be the calcium sensing regulatory subunit of the MCU because mutations of its EF-hand domains abrogate mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (13Hajnóczky G. Csordás G. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: R888-R891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Two proteins were reported to modulate Ca2+ extrusion from mitochondria. NCLX/NCKX6 was shown to catalyze CGP-37157-sensitive mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange (14Palty R. Silverman W.F. Hershfinkel M. Caporale T. Sensi S.L. Parnis J. Nolte C. Fishman D. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Herrmann S. Khananshvili D. Sekler I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), and SLP-2 was shown to negatively modulate the activity of the mitochondrial sodium-calcium exchanger (15Da Cruz S. De Marchi U. Frieden M. Parone P.A. Martinou J.C. Demaurex N. Cell Calcium. 2010; 47: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The successive reports of proteins essential for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake have generated some confusion about the identity and mode of operation of the MCU. The first proteins proposed to be fundamental for the MCU, UCP2 and UCP3 (16Azzu V. Brand M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 298-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), are mitochondrial inner membrane protein paralogues of UCP1, the first UCP cloned. UCP1 is almost exclusively expressed in brown adipose tissue, where it catalyzes adaptive thermogenesis by acting as a mitochondrial proton channel, thereby uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis (17Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 277-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (4525) Google Scholar). Unlike UCP1, UCP2 and UCP3 are expressed in several tissues and are present in ectothermic fishes and plants that do not require thermogenesis. The basal H+ conductance is unchanged in mitochondria isolated from UCP2 or UCP3 null mice (18Cadenas S. Echtay K.S. Harper J.A. Jekabsons M.B. Buckingham J.A. Grau E. Abuin A. Chapman H.

Goubern M. Bouillaud F. J. Biol.

Zhang C.Y. Lowell B.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 248-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), to modulate insulin secretion (21Chan C.B. MacDonald P.E. Saleh M.C. Johns D.C. Marbàn E. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and to regulate the export of fatty acids and fatty acid peroxides(22Himms-Hagen J. Harper M.E. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2001; 226: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 23Goglia F. Skulachev V.P. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1585-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The ability of UCP2/3 to act as proton leak channels seems strictly related to the presence of specific activators such as alkenyls produced by the peroxidation of membrane phospholipids (24Echtay K.S. Esteves T.C. Pakay J.L. Jekabsons M.B. Lambert A.J. Portero-Otín M. Pamplona R. Vidal-Puig A.J. Wang S. Roebuck S.J.

Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 85-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a broad consensus that UCP2 and UCP3 do not mediate adaptive thermogenesis (25Brand M.D. Esteves T.C. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 85-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 26Cioffi F. Senese R. de Lange P. Goglia F. Lanni A. Lombardi A.

Instead, the novel UCPs might act as mild uncouplers and protect against oxidative damage by attenuating the mitochondrial production of free radicals (28Arsenijevic D. Onuma H. Pecqueur C. Raimbault S. Manning B.S. Miroux B. Couplan E. Alves-Guerra M.C. Goubern M. Surwit R. Bouillaud F. Richard D. Collins S. Ricquier D. Nat.

Med. 2004; 37: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). The report that the amplitude of [Ca2+]mit elevations in intact cells directly correlates to the expression level of UCP2 and UCP3 (6Trenker M. Malli R. Fertschai I. Levak-Frank S. Graier W.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) might explain the plethoric effects attributed to UCPs because alterations in [Ca2+]mit signals are expected to impact both on mitochondria bioenergetics and on cell signaling. Whether the altered [Ca2+]mit signals are due to defective mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is unclear due to the conflicting reports obtained in isolated liver mitochondria from UCP2−/− null mice (6Trenker M. Malli R. Fertschai I. Levak-Frank S. Graier W.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 7Brookes P.S. Parker N. Buckingham J.A. Vidal-Puig A. Halestrap A.P.

These opposite datasets could be reconciled by postulating a regulatory role for UCP2 and UCP3 in intact cells that would be lost in isolated mitochondria. Importantly, the altered [Ca2+]mit signals reported by Trenker et al. (6Trenker M. Malli R. Fertschai I. Levak-Frank S. Graier W.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) in intact cells depleted or enriched of UCP2/3 have not been confirmed or disproved. To clarify the physiological role of UCPs in Ca2+ homeostasis, we used RNA interference to down-regulate UCP3, the only UCP isoform of HeLa cells (6Trenker M. Malli R. Fertschai I. Levak-Frank S. Graier W.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and measured the impact of UCP3 depletion on the Ca2+ and ATP levels in different cellular compartments. Minimal essential medium, fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent were obtained from Invitrogen. Histamine, thapsigargin (TG), antimycin A, and oligomycin were obtained from Sigma. 2,5-Di-t-butyl-1,4-benzohydroquinone (BHQ) were from Aldrich. Fura-2 AM was from Molecular Probes.

Amy Palmer and Roger Tsien (University of California, San Diego). Mitochondrial and cytosolic FRET-based ATP indicators (ATeam: adenosine 5′-triphosphate indicator based on the ϵ subunit for Analytical Measurements) were kindly provided by Drs. Hiromi Imamura (Japan Science and Technology Agency, Tokyo) and Hiroyuki Noji (Osaka University) (33Imamura H. Nhat K.P. Togawa H. Saito K. Iino R. Kato-Yamada Y. Nagai T. Noji H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 15651-15656Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). UCP2 and UCP3/mitochondria-targeted DsRed constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Wolfgang Graier (Medical University of Graz). Culturing of HeLa cells has been previously described (34Jousset H. Malli R. Girardin N. Graier W.F. Demaurex N. Frieden M. Cell Calcium. 2008; 43: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For all experiments, cells were plated on 25-mm-diameter glass coverslips and co-transfected with the plasmid (1 μg/ml) coding for Ca2+ or pH probe and dsRNA using Lipofectamine 2000. All experiments were performed 2 days after transfection. For silencing UCP3 expression, commercial double-stranded RNAs from Qiagen were used (Hi PerFect-validated siRNA S102780771). For controls, cells were transfected with nonsilencing siRNA (AllStars negative control siRNA, Qiagen 1027281). Knockdown efficiency was verified by Western blots. Whole cells were lysed for 30 min on ice in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min, and the protein content of the supernatant was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). The mitochondrial fraction was obtained by differential centrifugation as reported previously (35De Marchi U. Campello S. Szabò I. Tombola F. Martinou J.C. Zoratti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37415-37422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 50 μg of total protein (from cell lysate or isolated mitochondria) was loaded per lane of SDS-PAGE. For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and probed with the following antibodies: anti-UCP3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-7756) and anti-Tom20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-11415), anti-SERCA2 (Thermo Scientific MA3-919), and anti-actin (Chemicon). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used followed by detection by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Experiments were performed in HEPES buffer solution containing (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 20 Hepes, 10 glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH at 37 °C. Ca2+-free solution contained 1 mm EGTA instead of CaCl2. Glass coverslips were inserted in a thermostatic chamber (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), and solutions were changed by hand. Cells were imaged on an Axiovert s100 TV using a ×40, 1.3 NA oil immersion objective (Carl Zeiss AG, Feldbach, Switzerland) and a cooled, 16-bit CCD back-illuminated frame transfer MicroMax camera (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ). Cytosolic Ca2+ was measured with fura-2 (2 μm, 0.2% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 0.01% Pluronic F127, Invitrogen) followed by 20 min of de-esterification before 10 min of equilibration on the heated stage or with YC3.6cyto. Mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ levels were measured with 4mtD3cpv and D1ER, respectively. For dual emission imaging of cameleon constructs (4mtD3cpv, YC3.6cyto, and D1ER), cells were excited at 430 nm through a 455DRLP dichroic and alternately imaged with 480AF30 and 535DF25 emission filters (Omega Optical). Fura-2 was measured simultaneously with 4mtD3cpv and was excited alternately at 340 and 380 nm through a 455DRLP dichroic and 535DF25 emission filter. Images were acquired every 2 s. Fluorescence ratios were calculated in MetaFluor 6.3 (Universal Imaging) and analyzed in Excel (Microsoft) and GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad). [Ca]ER was calculated from D1ER ratios using the equation R=Rmin+[Rmax−Rmin]1+10(LogK′d−Log[Ca2+]ER)h(Eq. 1) where Rmin and Rmax are the minimal and maximal ratio obtained at pCa >8 and <2, respectively, K′d is the apparent dissociation constant, and h is the Hill coefficient derived from the in situ Ca2+ titration of the D1ER probe in semipermeabilized cells, as described previously (36Poburko D. Liao C.H. van Breemen C. Demaurex N. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). ATP imaging was performed on the epifluorescence system described above, with the genetically encoded ATP sensors ATeammito and ATeamcyto, for mitochondrial and cytosolic ATP, respectively. For the dual emission imaging of these two cameleon-based constructs, cells were excited and imaged as described previously for mitochondrial Ca2+ imaging. Images were acquired every 2 s. Fluorescence ratios were normalized on the minimum of fluorescence (Rmin), obtained after inhibition of glycolysis with 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose and in the presence of the inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP synthesis oligomycin A (10 μg/ml). Data were analyzed as described previously. Cells were washed with high K+ intracellular buffer, containing (in mm) 110 KCl, 10 NaCl, 0.5 K2HPO4, 5 succinate, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0 at 37 °C), supplemented with 5 HEDTA or 1 EGTA. For permeabilization, 100 μm digitonin was added for 1 min, and the cells were then allowed to recover in intracellular buffer before the addition of CaCl2. Free [Ca2+] was calculated with the Maxchelator program. The significance of differences between means was established using the Student's t test for unpaired samples (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). To clarify the role of UCPs in mitochondrial Ca2+ handling, we measured Ca2+ responses in the cytosol and in mitochondria in HeLa cells depleted or not of UCP3, the only novel UCP isoform expressed in this cell type (6Trenker M. Malli R. Fertschai I. Levak-Frank S. Graier W.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Consistent with earlier results (6Trenker M. Malli R. Fertschai I. Levak-Frank S. Graier W.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), this treatment decreased UCP3 protein levels by 50% (supplemental Fig. S1). Cells were then transfected with a cameleon Ca2+ probe targeted to mitochondria (Fig. 1A) or to the cytosol (Fig. 1B) to enable [Ca2+]mit and [Ca2+]cyt recordings. As shown in Fig. 1A, UCP3 depletion strongly reduced the [Ca2+]mit elevations evoked by histamine, the peak [Ca2+]mit response being reduced by 57% and the integrated response being reduced by 62%. To exclude possible off-target effects linked to siRNA transfection, we overexpressed UCP3 protein and, in another set of experiments, attempted to rescue the defect caused by UCP3 siRNA by expressing another uncoupling protein, UCP2. As shown in supplemental Fig. S2A, UCP3 overexpression significantly increased the peak and integrated [Ca2+]mit responses evoked by histamine, mirroring the effects of UCP3 depletion, whereas expression of UCP2 restored normal [Ca2+]mit responses in cells depleted of UCP3 (supplemental Fig. S3A). These data indicate that the altered mitochondrial Ca2+ signals are indeed causally related to the changes in UCP3 levels. The UCP3-dependent Ca2+ defect was not restricted to mitochondria, however, because the cytosolic Ca2+ elevations were also reduced in cells depleted of UCP3, the peak and integrated [Ca2+]cyt responses being decreased by 25 and 44%, respectively (Fig. 1B). To confirm that the alteration in Ca2+ handling affected both compartments, we measured [Ca2+]cyt and [Ca2+]mit simultaneously instead of separately. In these conditions, both the cytosolic and the mitochondrial Ca2+ responses were blunted in cells depleted of UCP3 (supplemental Fig. S4). These data indicate that UCP3 knockdown has a global effect and not only blunts mitochondrial Ca2+ elevations but also reduces cytosolic Ca2+ elevations. The novel UCPs have been recently proposed to specifically mediate the mitochondrial uptake of Ca2+ released from the ER, but not of the Ca2+ entering across SOCE channels (37Waldeck-Weiermair M. Malli R. Naghdi S. Trenker M. Kahn M.J. Graier W.F. Cell Calcium. 2010; 47: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To verify this possibility, we separated the agonist-evoked Ca2+ response into its release and influx components. Cells were stimulated with histamine in Ca2+-free conditions to mobilize Ca2+ from stores, and Ca2+ was subsequently readmitted to promote Ca2+ entry. As shown in Fig. 2, the [Ca2+]cyt and [Ca2+]mit elevations caused by Ca2+ release from stores were slightly but significantly decreased. This inhibition, however, was much smaller than the inhibition observed in Ca2+-containing medium (Fig. 1). Unexpectedly, the [Ca2+]cyt elevations evoked by Ca2+ readmission were severely blunted in cells depleted of UCP3, the integrated [Ca2+]cyt response being reduced by 82% (Fig. 2A). An opposite effect was obtained by overexpressing UCP3, the [Ca2+]cyt responses increasing slightly (14%) during Ca2+ release from stores and markedly (75%) during Ca2+ influx (supplemental Fig. S2B). Moreover, UCP2 expression restored a normal Ca2+ influx in UCP3-depleted cells (supplemental Fig. S3B), confirming that this defect was due to the depletion of an uncoupling protein. As reported previously (38Frieden M. James D. Castelbou C. Danckaert A. Martinou J.C. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22704-22714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the [Ca2+]mit elevations evoked by this Ca2+ readmission protocol were barely detectable and were not altered by UCP3 depletion (Fig. 2B). These observations indicate that UCP3 depletion slightly impairs Ca2+ release from stores and, surprisingly, strongly inhibits the cytosolic Ca2+ elevations caused by Ca2+ readmission to cells with depleted Ca2+ stores. The primary effect of UCP3 depletion thus appears to be a reduced entry of Ca2+ across SOCE channels. SOCE channels are activated by the depletion of ER Ca2+ stores, which induces the translocation of the ER-resident Ca2+ sensor STIM1 to the plasma membrane, where it binds and activates the Orai and Transient Receptor Potential channels (39Prakriya M. Immunol. Rev. 2009; 231: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The reduced Ca2+ entry of UCP3 knockdown cells suggested that the SOCE machinery was inhibited, prompting us to study the filling state of ER Ca2+ stores. We therefore measured [Ca2+]ER at rest and during store depletion with the ER-targeted cameleon Ca2+ indicator D1ER. As shown in Fig. 3A, D1ER basal ratio fluorescence levels were identical in control and UCP3-depleted cells, the basal [Ca2+]ER levels averaging 520 μm in both conditions (supplemental Fig. S5, A and B). Upon stimulation with histamine, however, [Ca2+]ER decreased much more slowly in cells depleted of UCP3, the half-time increasing from 72 to 269 s (Fig. 3B, inset). This four times slower [Ca2+]ER decrease was surprising considering that UCP3 knockdown cells released Ca2+ efficiently when stimulated with agonists (Fig. 2A). Reduced depletion of ER Ca2+ stores could reflect either a reduced passive permeability to Ca2+ or an increased Ca2+ pumping into the ER. To distinguish between these possibilities, we inhibited SERCA pumps with TG to reveal the intrinsic Ca2+ leak rates of the ER. As shown in Fig. 3C, the addition of TG elicited identical [Ca2+]ER decreases in control and UCP3 knockdown cells, indicating that the passive Ca2+ permeability of the ER was not affected by the depletion of UCP3. The addition of TG together with histamine accelerated the kinetics of [Ca2+]ER decrease by ∼2-fold in UCP3-depleted cells, but these cells still released Ca2+ more slowly than control cells (supplemental Fig. S5C). Because [Ca2+]ER decreased significantly ∼40 s after TG addition (supplemental Fig. S5D), we then added TG 40 s before histamine to ensure full inhibition of SERCA. In these conditions, the kinetics of [Ca2+]ER decrease evoked by histamine were similar in control and UCP3-depleted cells (Fig. 3D). These data indicate that the both the passive and the active (i.e. InsP3R-mediated) Ca2+ permeability of the ER are not affected by the depletion of UCP3. Similar effects were observed with the reversible SERCA inhibitor BHQ (not shown), confirming the involvement of SERCA. Of note, BHQ required more time than TG to completely inhibit SERCA pumps (supplemental Fig. S5E; see under “Discussion” to compare our results with recent data of the Graier group (37Waldeck-Weiermair M. Malli R. Naghdi S. Trenker M. Kahn M.J. Graier W.F. Cell Calcium. 2010; 47: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)). The restoration of normal ER Ca2+ release in cells depleted of UCP3 by SERCA inhibitors suggested that the activity of SERCA was increased in these cells. The expression levels of SERCA2b assessed by Western blot (Fig. 4A) and real-time quantitative PCR (not shown) were not influenced by UCP3 depletion. To directly estimate the activity of SERCA, intact cells were transiently treated with the reversible inhibitor BHQ to deplete ER Ca2+ stores, and Ca2+ was then readmitted to promote store refilling. As shown in Fig. 4B, the kinetics of ER refilling were faster in cells depleted of UCP3, the time required to reach half-maximal refilling being increased by 14 s, confirming that SERCA pumps were more active in these cells. This difference was not observed in permeabilized cells, however, the kinetics of ER refilling being identical in this condition (Fig. 4C). Our [Ca2+]ER measurements thus indicate that the activity of SERCA pumps is increased in intact cells depleted of UCP3.FIGURE 4E"
https://openalex.org/W2049559659,"Recent genetic studies in mice have established that the nuclear receptor coregulator Trim24/Tif1α suppresses hepatocarcinogenesis by inhibiting retinoic acid receptor α (Rara)-dependent transcription and cell proliferation. However, Rara targets regulated by Trim24 remain unknown. We report that the loss of Trim24 resulted in interferon (IFN)/STAT pathway overactivation soon after birth (week 5). Despite a transient attenuation of this pathway by the induction of several IFN/STAT pathway repressors later in the disease, this phenomenon became more pronounced in tumors. Remarkably, Rara haplodeficiency, which suppresses tumorigenesis in Trim24(-/-) mice, prevented IFN/STAT overactivation. Moreover, together with Rara, Trim24 bound to the retinoic acid-responsive element of the Stat1 promoter and repressed its retinoic acid-induced transcription. Altogether, these results identify Trim24 as a novel negative regulator of the IFN/STAT pathway and suggest that this repression through Rara inhibition may prevent liver cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2017945956,"The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is a member of the ENaC/degenerin superfamily. ENaC is a heteromultimer containing three homologous subunits (α, β, and γ); however, the subunit stoichiometry is still controversial. Here, we addressed this issue using atomic force microscopy imaging of complexes between isolated ENaC and antibodies/Fab fragments directed against specific epitope tags on the α-, β- and γ-subunits. We show that for α-, β- and γ-ENaC alone, pairs of antibodies decorate the channel at an angle of 120°, indicating that the individual subunits assemble as homotrimers. A similar approach demonstrates that αβγ-ENaC assembles as a heterotrimer containing one copy of each subunit. Intriguingly, all four subunit combinations also produce higher-order structures containing two or three individual trimers. The trimer-of-trimers organization would account for earlier reports that ENaC contains eight to nine subunits. The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is a member of the ENaC/degenerin superfamily. ENaC is a heteromultimer containing three homologous subunits (α, β, and γ); however, the subunit stoichiometry is still controversial.

https://openalex.org/W1996789373,"The Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and the NMDA-type glutamate receptor are key regulators of synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory. Direct binding of CaMKII to the NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B (formerly known as NR2B) (i) is induced by Ca(2+)/CaM but outlasts this initial Ca(2+)-stimulus, (ii) mediates CaMKII translocation to synapses, and (iii) regulates synaptic strength. CaMKII binds to GluN2B around S1303, the major CaMKII phosphorylation site on GluN2B. We show here that a phospho-mimetic S1303D mutation inhibited CaM-induced CaMKII binding to GluN2B in vitro, presenting a conundrum how binding can occur within cells, where high ATP concentration should promote S1303 phosphorylation. Surprisingly, addition of ATP actually enhanced the binding. Mutational analysis revealed that this positive net effect was caused by four modulatory effects of ATP, two positive (direct nucleotide binding and CaMKII T286 autophosphorylation) and two negative (GluN2B S1303 phosphorylation and CaMKII T305/6 autophosphorylation). Imaging showed positive regulation by nucleotide binding also within transfected HEK cells and neurons. In fact, nucleotide binding was a requirement for efficient CaMKII interaction with GluN2B in cells, while T286 autophosphorylation was not. Kinetic considerations support a model in which positive regulation by nucleotide binding and T286 autophosphorylation occurs faster than negative modulation by GluN2B S1303 and CaMKII T305/6 phosphorylation, allowing efficient CaMKII binding to GluN2B despite the inhibitory effects of the two slower reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2159607334,"Pathogenic bacteria use type 3 secretion systems to deliver virulence factors (type 3 effector proteins) directly into eukaryotic host cells. Similarly, type 3 effectors of certain nitrogen-fixing rhizobial strains affect nodule formation in the symbiosis with host legumes. Nodulation outer protein L (NopL) of Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 is a Rhizobium-specific type 3 effector. Nodulation tests and microscopic analysis showed that distinct necrotic areas were rapidly formed in ineffective nodules of Phaseolus vulgaris (cv. Tendergreen) induced by strain NGRΩnopL (NGR234 mutated in nopL), indicating that NopL antagonized nodule senescence. Further experiments revealed that NopL interfered with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in yeast and plant cells (Nicotiana tabacum). Expression of nopL in yeast disrupted the mating pheromone (α-factor) response pathway, whereas nopL expression in N. tabacum suppressed cell death induced either by overexpression of the MAPK gene SIPK (salicylic acid-induced protein kinase) or by SIPKDD (mutation in the TXY motif resulting in constitutive MAPK activity). These data indicate that NopL impaired function of MAPK proteins or MAPK substrates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NopL was multiply phosphorylated either in yeast or N. tabacum cells that expressed nopL. Four phosphorylated serines were confirmed by mass spectrometry. All four phosphorylation sites exhibit a Ser-Pro pattern, a typical motif in MAPK substrates. Taken together, data suggest that NopL mimics a MAPK substrate and that NopL suppresses premature nodule senescence by impairing MAPK signaling in host cells.

https://openalex.org/W2112634401,"Degradation of immunoglobulins is an effective strategy of bacteria to evade the immune system. We have tested whether human IgG is a substrate for gingipain K of Porphyromonas gingivalis and found that the enzyme can hydrolyze subclass 1 and 3 of human IgG. The heavy chain of IgG(1) was cleaved at a single site within the hinge region, generating Fab and Fc fragments. IgG(3) was also cleaved within the heavy chain, but at several sites around the CH2 region. Investigation of the enzyme kinetics of IgG proteolysis by gingipain K, using FPLC- and isothermal titration calorimetry-based assays followed by Hill plots, revealed non-Michaelis-Menten kinetics involving a mechanism of positive cooperativity. In ex vivo studies, it was shown that gingipain K retained its IgG hydrolyzing activity in human plasma despite the high content of natural protease inhibitors; that IgG(1) cleavage products were detected in gingival crevicular fluid samples from patients with severe periodontitis; and that gingipain K treatment of serum samples from patients with high antibody titers against P. gingivalis significantly hindered opsonin-dependent phagocytosis of clinical isolates of P. gingivalis by neutrophils. Altogether, these findings underline a biological function of gingipain K as an IgG protease of pathophysiological importance."
https://openalex.org/W1976623893,"This study explores the changes in expression of microRNA (miRNA) and related genes under simulated microgravity conditions. In comparison with static 1 × g, microgravity has been shown to alter global gene expression patterns and protein levels in cultured cells or animals. miRNA has recently emerged as an important regulator of gene expression, possibly regulating as many as one-third of all human genes. However, very little is known about the effect of altered gravity on miRNA expression. To test the hypothesis that the miRNA expression profile would be altered in zero gravity resulting in altered regulation of gene expression leading to metabolic or functional changes in cells, we cultured TK6 human lymphoblastoid cells in a high aspect ratio vessel (bioreactor) for 72 h either in the rotating condition to model microgravity in space or in the static condition as a control. Expression of several miRNAs was changed significantly in the simulated microgravity condition including miR-150, miR-34a, miR-423-5p, miR-22, miR-141, miR-618, and miR-222. To confirm whether this altered miRNA expression correlates with gene expression and functional changes of the cells, we performed DNA microarray and validated the related genes using quantitative RT-PCR. Expression of several transcription factors including EGR2, ETS1, and c-REL was altered in simulated microgravity conditions. Taken together, the results reported here indicate that simulated microgravity alters the expression of miRNAs and genes in TK6 cells. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report the effects of simulated microgravity on the expression of miRNA and related genes."

In this study, we extracted Lentinan (LNT-S) by ultrasonication from Lentinus edodes and report that, in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages, LNT-S glucan activated NF-κB p65 and triggered its nuclear translocation as determined by Western blotting. Moreover, LNT-S enhanced NF-κB-luciferase activity in the Dual-Luciferase gene system assay. Its upstream signaling molecules, MAPKs such as ERK1/2 and JNK1/2, were shown to be activated by assessing the level of phosphorylation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, but its downstream proinflammatory enzyme, inducible NOS, was not observed. The data evaluated using a TNF-α ELISA kit and Griess reagent further demonstrated that no proinflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and NO were produced by LNT-S stimulation in RAW 264.7 cells. In contrast, LPS significantly induced inducible NOS expression and increased NO and TNF-α production, which are associated with activation of the NF-κB p65/p50 heterodimer complex. It is possible that LNT-S did not activate NF-κB p65/p50, and the activation of NF-κB p65 was not sufficient to stimulate cytokine production.

It is possible that the different immunomodulatory reaction was highly dependent on the genotype of the host.

In contrast, the signal transduction of β-glucans, in particular water-insoluble zymosan or yeast glucan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model of immunomodulatory glucans, has been partly elucidated (32Gross O.

It has been reported that, after activation of receptor dectin-1 by zymosan, spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is recruited and induces the assembly of a scaffold consisting of the Card9 (caspase recruitment domain 9) protein and the adaptor proteins Bcl10 and Malt1; the Card9-Bcl10-Malt1 scaffold then couples dectin-1 to the canonical NF-κB pathway by activation of the IκB kinase complex, leading to nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunit p65 (32Gross O.

Therefore, in this study, we explored activation of RAW 264.7 macrophages induced by Lentinan to clarify the signal transduction pathways used by Lentinan. The dried fruiting bodies of L. edodes, a commercial product cultivated in the Fujian Province of China, were cut into small pieces and refluxed in ethyl acetate and then acetone for 8 h. After refluxing, the dried residues were dipped into 0.9% NaCl aqueous solution with continuous stirring at 25 °C for 24 h and centrifuged. This process was repeated three times, and the residues were extracted in hot water (120 °C) three times again. After the hot water extraction, the final residues were ultrasonicated (500 watts, 18 min, 25 °C) in pure water. The collected supernatant was treated with 30% H2O2 to decolorize and subjected to the method of Sevag (35Sevag M.G. Biochem. Z. 1934; 273: 419-429Google Scholar) to remove free proteins, followed by dialysis against distilled water (Mr cutoff = 8000) for 10 days. The solution was then filtered, concentrated by a rotary evaporator at reduced pressure below 45 °C, and precipitated into acetone. The precipitates were redissolved in pure water and lyophilized to obtain white pure flakes coded as Lentinan (LNT-S) 2The abbreviations used are: LNT-SLentinaniNOSinducible NOS. with a yield of 0.4%. LNT-S was identified as β-(1,3)-d-glucan with β-(1,6)-branches by GC-MS and NMR. LNT-S dissolved in PBS was sterilized at 121 °C for 20 min and used in the following experiments. Lentinan inducible NOS. DMEM (glutamine, high glucose), penicillin, streptomycin, and LPS from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies were obtained from the following sources: mouse monoclonal anti-inducible NOS (iNOS), BD Transduction Laboratories; rabbit polyclonal anti-NF-κB p65, rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2, rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-JNK1/2, and rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p38, Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); and mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin, Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). RAW 264.7 cells (a murine macrophage/monocyte-like cell line; American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in DMEM (glutamine, high glucose) supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Sekisui Medical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at 56 °C for 30 min. Subculturing was done by dislodging the cells with trypsin (0.25%) and EDTA·2Na·2H2O (0.02%), followed by centrifugation and seeding into the culture flask or dish, which was incubated at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. The cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were extracted following the procedure described previously (36Young S.H. Ye J. Frazer D.G. Shi X. Castranova V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20781-20787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, RAW 264.7 cells were plated in a 60-mm culture dish at a density of 5 × 106 cells/dish in DMEM with 10% FBS for 24 h. The cells were then rinsed with sterilized PBS and exposed to LPS (100 ng/ml) and LNT-S (0∼200 μg/ml) in DMEM without FBS. At the end of treatment, the cells were harvested by scrapping and treated with 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 mm dithiothreitol) on ice for 10 min. After a 5-min centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, the supernatant was saved as the cytoplasmic extract. The remaining nuclear pellet was washed once with the same volume of buffer without Nonidet P-40. The nuclear pellet was then treated with 40 μl of extraction buffer (500 mm KCl and 10% glycerol with the same concentrations of HEPES, PMSF, leupeptin, aprotinin, and dithiothreitol as in lysis buffer) on ice for 40 min with pipetting every 10 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was harvested as the nuclear protein extract. Both the cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts were preserved at −70 °C for Western blot assay. The protein concentration was determined using Bradford protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) and BSA (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) as the reference. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear lysates were mixed with 4× SDS sample buffer and denatured in boiling water for 5 min. Aliquots of 10∼15 μg of denatured cytoplasmic proteins and 15∼25 μg of denatured nuclear proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and then electrically transferred to a PVDF membrane (BioTrace, Pall Corp., Port Washington, NY). After blocking with 5% (w/v) BSA in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature for 1 h, the membranes were then incubated with an appropriate specific primary antibody (anti-iNOS, 1:8000; anti-ERK1/2, 1:1000; anti-JNK1/2, 1:1000; anti-p38, 1:1000; anti-NF-κB p65, 1:1000; or anti-β-actin, 1:20,000) overnight at 4 °C. The reactive bands were visualized with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:20;000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) via ECL Western blot detection reagent on a LightCapture II system (ATTO, Tokyo) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RAW 264.7 cells in 24-well plates (3 × 105 cells/well) were preincubated for 12 h and then transfected with 0.8 μl of NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter vectors using 1.56 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in 26 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) per well. After a 6-h transfection, the cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated for an additional 6 h in DMEM with 10% FBS. The cells were then stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) and LNT-S (200 μg/ml) in DMEM without FBS. Following 12-h stimulations, cells were lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assessed using a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay (Promega, Madison, WI) and a Wallac microplate luminometer (1420 ARVO Sx, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturers' instructions. NF-κB activity was expressed as -fold induction relative to the control cells without LPS treatment. NO production was determined based on the amount of nitrite present in the conditioned medium, a stable end product of NO, by the Griess reaction. Briefly, RAW 264.7 cells were seeded (5 × 105 cells/well) in 24-well plates and incubated for 24 h. The cells were rinsed with PBS and exposed to LPS (100 ng/ml) and LNT-S in DMEM without FBS. After a 24-h stimulation, each supernatant (100 μl) was mixed with an equal volume of Griess reagent (50 μl of 1% sulfanilamide in 5% phosphoric acid and 50 μl of 0.1% N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride in distilled water) at room temperature. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm using the Wallac microplate luminometer (1420 ARVO Sx), and the concentration of NO was quantified with a standard curve generated with sodium nitrite in the range of 0–100 μm. RAW 264.7 cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were seeded in 24-well plates and incubated for 24 h before stimulation. At the end of the preincubation period, cells were rinsed with PBS, and the medium was exchanged to DMEM without FBS. The cells were exposed to LPS (100 ng/ml) and LNT-S (200 μg/ml), respectively. After a 24-h stimulation, the conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged, and TNF-α levels in the supernatant were assessed using an ELISA kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All data are presented as the mean ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments unless specified otherwise. Student's t test was performed, and the differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Fig. 1 shows the concentration and time courses of iNOS, ERK1/2, and JNK1/2 activation by LNT-S in murine RAW 264.7 macrophage cells as measured by Western blotting. LPS was also used in the stimulation of RAW 264.7 cells as a positive control. Similar to the positive control, ERK1/2 was phosphorylated by LNT-S, and activation became stronger with an increase in LNT-S concentration (Fig. 1A) in 24-h stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. In the positive control, LPS induced not only ERK1/2 activation (evaluated by the level of phosphorylation, labeled by phospho-ERK1/2) but also iNOS production. However, LNT-S itself could not induce notable iNOS production at the different concentrations used in this experiment (Fig. 1A). The phosphorylation of two other MAPKs, phospho-JNK1/2 and phospho-p38, was not observed (data not shown). In the case of the time course, both phospho-JNK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2 protein bands were observed after a 15-min stimulation by LNT-S (Fig. 1B). The density of the phospho-JNK1/2 protein band peaked at 1 h and then gradually declined thereafter (Fig. 1B), which can be explained as degradation of the protein. The phosphorylation level of phospho-ERK1/2 also reached the maximal value at 1 h of stimulation and almost leveled off within 24 h. The activation of p38 MAPK was not detectable in the time course experiments (data not shown). These data demonstrate that, in murine RAW 264.7 macrophage cells, LNT-S directly triggers a rapid and strong activation of JNK1/2 and ERK1/2, but not iNOS. The transcription factor NF-κB is largely involved in immune responses and expression of proinflammation elicited by a variety of mediators, including LPS. Fig. 1B shows that the amount of NF-κB p65 observed after a 15-min activation increased with stimulation time and almost peaked at 1∼2 h and then decreased due to protein degradation. It has been reported that zymosan significantly activates NF-κB at 2 h after stimulation (36Young S.H. Ye J. Frazer D.G. Shi X. Castranova V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20781-20787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To verify that NF-κB in the nucleus was transactivated, the NF-κB activity was assessed by transfecting an NF-κB-luciferase reporter into RAW 264.7 cells using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay. Reporter activity in LNT-S-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells was elevated relative to that in unstimulated cells, similar to the positive control (LPS-stimulated cells) (Fig. 2). LNT-S directly triggers NF-κB activation in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. Murine macrophages activated by LPS in vitro express iNOS to synthesize NO (37Lorsbach R.B. Murphy W.J. Lowenstein C.J. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1908-1913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is a key molecule in the immunopharmacology of β-glucans. ERK and JNK are thought to regulate production of inflammatory cytokines and mediators such as TNF-α and NO (38Hambleton J. Weinstein S.L. Lem L. DeFranco A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 2774-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 39Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 25: 808-811Crossref Scopus (2410) Google Scholar, 40Lee J.C. Laydon J.T.

Moreover, activation of the classic NF-κB transcription factor is often associated with the production of inflammatory cytokines (42Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5563) Google Scholar, 43Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 8-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 44Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4271) Google Scholar). Because LNT-S triggers NF-κB activation and MAPKs ERK1/2 and JNK1/2, proinflammatory mediators such as NO and TNF-α were evaluated (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, LNT-S itself could not induce NO (Fig. 3A) or TNF-α (Fig. 3B) production, in contrast to LPS, which stimulated RAW 264.7 cells to produce a large amount of NO and TNF-α (Fig. 3). We can thus conclude that LPS induces production of NO and TNF-α, whereas LNT-S does not, indicating that LNT-S is not contaminated with significant levels of endotoxin. In this work, β-glucan from L. edodes (LNT-S) was shown to stimulate murine RAW 264.7 macrophage cells by activation of MAPKs ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 and transcription factor NF-κB (Fig. 1). Moreover, activation occurred in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Western blotting indicated that the nuclear titer of NF-κB p65 increased in response to LPS and LNT-S treatment of the RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 1B), which was probably due to its translocation from the cytoplasm. The increase in NF-κB-luciferase activity further demonstrated that the nuclear transcription factor was really activated by LNT-S. LPS is known to induce MAPK-dependent phosphorylation, thereby activating multiple transcription factors to translocate to the nucleus, facilitating DNA-binding activity, and leading to up-regulation of iNOS expression (41Kim J.W. Kim C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 70: 1352-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 45Tebo J.M. Chaoqun W. Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4713-4720PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, NF-κB is a major activator for TNF-α production in macrophages and a central target for activators or inhibitors of iNOS expression (46Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar, 47Xie Q.W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, zymosan-induced TNF-α production in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells is associated essentially with activation of NF-κB, similar to LPS (36Young S.H. Ye J. Frazer D.G. Shi X. Castranova V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20781-20787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Figs. 1A and 3, LNT-S showed a major difference compared with LPS and zymosan; LNT-S could not induce iNOS expression or production of NO and TNF-α regardless of its activation of MAPKs (ERK1/2 and JNK1/2) and NF-κB. This phenomenon is very similar to that of water-soluble PGG-glucan, a β-(1,3)-glucan with β-(1,6)-branches that activates NF-κB p65 without inducing inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 (48Adams D.S. Pero S.C. Petro J.B. Nathans R. Mackin W.M. Wakshull E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 865-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This was attributed to the fact that PGG-glucan increased the titer of only p65, but not other NF-κB subunits such as p50, p52, p68, and p75, and that p65 formed a heterodimer complex (called NF-κB-like transcription factor) with another unknown unit. It is well known that the activated form of NF-κB is a heterodimer, which usually consists of two proteins, a p65 (also called RelA) subunit and a p50 subunit. Other subunits, including C-Rel, RelB, v-Rel, and p52, may also be part of activated NF-κB (48Adams D.S. Pero S.C. Petro J.B. Nathans R. Mackin W.M. Wakshull E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 865-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 49Gringhuis S.I. den Dunnen J. Litjens M. van der Vlist M. Wevers B. Bruijns S.C. Geijtenbeek T.B. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Of these, the classic p65/p50 heterodimer complex has been demonstrated to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α (42Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5563) Google Scholar, 43Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 8-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 44Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4271) Google Scholar) and the proinflammatory mediator NO. On the basis of the fact discussed above and the study of PGG-glucan, we can attribute this to the following: LNT-S increased the titer of p65, which could not form a heterodimer with p52 but maybe a complex called NF-κB-like transcription factor with another unknown unit and was not sufficient to stimulate inflammatory cytokine mRNA transcription and cytokine production. Whether this is true or not will be determined in future work. As we know, the well studied zymosan particle activates β-glucan receptor dectin-1, followed by recruiting Syk, leading to activation of NF-κB and proinflammatory cytokine production, whereas water-soluble PGG-glucan activates NF-κB without production of proinflammatory cytokines. LNT-S is more similar to PGG-glucan. Water solubility likely plays an important role in the regulation of immunomodulating activity. This work is one of the first reports demonstrating that Lentinan activates ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and NF-κB p65 without production of proinflammatory cytokines. Study of the upstream signaling pathway will be continued in our future work. In summary, our results suggest that the β-glucan extracted from L. edodes by ultrasonication directly stimulated macrophages by inducing phosphorylation of MAPKs ERK1/2 and JNK1/2, but not p38. Subunit p65 of nuclear transcription factor NF-κB was shown to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and NF-κB-luciferase activity was also enhanced compared with the blank (PBS) and the positive control (LPS stimulation). However, TNF-α and NO were not produced in the supernatant of RAW 264.7 cells, which may be explained by the lack of formation of the active NF-κB p65/p50 heterodimer complex."

The data confirm that few α4β4 nAChRs, but many α4β2 nAChRs, remain in neutral intracellular compartments, mostly the ER. We observed fusion events between nAChR-containing vesicles and PM; these could be quantified in the dendritic processes. We also studied the β4R348C polymorphism, linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This mutation depressed fusion rates of α4β4 receptor-containing vesicles with the PM by ∼2-fold, with only a small decrease in the number of nAChRs per vesicle. The mutation also decreased the number of ER exit sites, showing that the reduced receptor insertion results from a change at an early stage in trafficking. We confirm the previous report that the mutation leads to reduced agonist-induced currents; in the cortical neurons studied, the reduction amounts to 2–3-fold. Therefore, the reduced agonist-induced currents are caused by the reduced number of α4β4-containing vesicles reaching the membrane. Chronic nicotine exposure (0.2 μm) did not alter the PM insertion frequency or trafficking behavior of α4β4-laden vesicles. In contrast, chronic nicotine substantially increased the number of α4β2-containing vesicle fusions at the PM; this stage in α4β2 nAChR up-regulation is presumably downstream from increased ER exit.

The expression mechanism of glycosyltransferases, however, is poorly understood.

Using an epigenetic approach, we revealed that the genomic region around the transcriptional start site of the GnT-IX gene was highly associated with active chromatin histone marks in a neural cell-specific manner, indicating that brain-specific GnT-IX expression is under control of an epigenetic “histone code.” By EMSA and ChIP analyses we identified two regulatory proteins, NeuroD1 and CTCF that bind to and activate the GnT-IX promoter. We also revealed that GnT-IX expression was suppressed in CTCF- and NeuroD1-depleted cells, indicating that a NeuroD1- and CTCF-dependent epigenetic mechanism governs brain-specific GnT-IX expression.

Glycosylation is a major post-translational modification reaction of proteins and plays various roles in mammals during early development, neural plasticity, inflammation, and disease progression (1Ohtsubo K.

For example, polysialic acid and human natural killer-1 (HNK-1) epitope are synthesized in the nervous system and involved in synaptic plasticity (4Eckhardt M. Bukalo O. Chazal G. Wang L. Goridis C.

During the last few decades, most glycosyltransferase genes have been cloned (7Taniguchi N. Honke K. Fukuda M. Handbook of Glycosyltransferases and Related Genes. Springer, Tokyo2002Crossref Google Scholar), and some of their promoters have been characterized by conventional reporter assay methods. These studies revealed that most glycosyltransferase genes have TATA-less, CpG-associated promoters; however, very limited studies have been reported on the underlying molecular mechanism by which glycans are expressed (8Chen G.Y. Osada H. Santamaria-Babi L.F. Kannagi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16894-16899Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, although epigenetic regulation mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA, are fundamental for controlling gene expression (9Goldberg A.D. Allis C.D. Bernstein E. Cell. 2007; 128: 635-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar), there have been few studies addressing the epigenetic mechanisms of tissue-specific glycosyltransferase expression. Previously, we cloned a brain-specific glycosyltransferase, GnT-IX (MGAT5B), as a homolog of GnT-V (10Inamori K. Endo T. Ide Y. Fujii S. Gu J. Honke K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43102-43109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). GnT-V, which is a well-known β1,6-branching enzyme toward the α1–6 mannose arm of N-glycan, is ubiquitously expressed and is involved in growth factor receptor signaling (11Partridge E.A. Le Roy C.

GnT-V is up-regulated by the oncogenic transcription factor, ETS1, and is associated with cancer progression (12Ko J.H. Miyoshi E. Noda K. Ekuni A. Kang R. Ikeda Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol.

O-Mannosyl glycan is a rare modification in mammals, and this glycan attached to α-dystroglycan has a pivotal role for skeletal muscle integrity through binding with extracellular proteins such as laminin and agrin (15Barresi R.

Matthews R.T. Pierce M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33026-33035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of GnT-IX in PC12 cells enhanced nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated neurite outgrowth probably by modulating integrin-extracellular matrix interaction (17Lee I. Guo H.B. Kamar M. Abbott K. Troupe K. Lee J.K. Alvarez-Manilla G. Pierce M. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These observations indicate an intrinsic and specific role of GnT-IX in the nervous system. In this study, we show that neural GnT-IX expression is under the control of neural cell-specific histone modifications (18Kouzarides T. Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7825) Google Scholar). The histone code hypothesis predicts that the post-translational modifications of histones, alone or in combination, function to direct specific and distinct DNA-templated programs and that the post-translationally modified histones serve as extremely selective binding platforms for specific regulatory proteins that drive distinct nuclear processes (19Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Cell Res. 2011; 21: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (3183) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, we identified two nuclear proteins, CTCF and NeuroD1, which bound to and activated the GnT-IX promoter in neural cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that expression of other neural glycosyltransferases is likely to be regulated by a similar epigenetic mechanism.

Human CTCF cDNA (cloned from MCF7 cells cDNA), mouse NeuroD1, NeuroD2, Math2, Neurogenin1, Olig1 and CaMKIIα cDNAs (cloned from 10-week-old mouse brain cDNA) were ligated into pCR4Blunt-TOPO (Invitrogen), then digested and ligated using EcoRI. The NeuroD1 point mutation (S336A) was generated using QuickChange II XL Site-directed Mutagenesis kit. Primers are listed in supplemental Fig. S8. Cells, plated on 6-cm culture dishes, were transfected with 1 μg of each pGV construct and 0.1 μg of pRL-TK (Toyo Ink) using FUGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche). 24 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then lysed with 500 μl of lysis buffer (PicaGene Dual SeaPansy Luminescence Kit, Toyo Ink). Luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with a luminometer, TR717 (Applied Biosystems). The luminescence value of firefly luciferase was divided by that of Renilla luciferase (pRL-TK), and the resultant value is shown in figures as “luciferase activity.” As a negative control, cells were transfected with pGV-B2 empty vector. For CTCF or NeuroD1 overexpression, 1 μg of expression plasmid was co-transfected with the luciferase vectors. For CTCF knockdown, cells at 30% confluency were transfected with 80 pmol of siRNA using 8 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 4 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium. 24 h post-transfection, the luciferase plasmids were transfected using FUGENE6 as described above. Cells (semi-confluent on 10-cm dishes) were washed twice with PBS and collected. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 300 μl of hypotonic buffer A (10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 15 min. After adding 18.75 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40, the sample was vortexed for 10 s and then centrifuged at 500 × g for 3 min. The pellet was then washed with 300 μl of buffer A and centrifuged. After repeating the wash and centrifugation, the resultant pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of high salt buffer B (20 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors) and then incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was used as a nuclear extract. Protein concentration was measured using a BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific). Oligonucleotides were biotinylated using a Biotin 3′-end DNA labeling kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The oligonucleotides used were GCGAGACTGCGGCCACCAGATGGCGCTCAGGCGCCGAGG and its complementary sequence. The labeled complementary oligonucleotides were mixed in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA and 50 mm NaCl and incubated at 95 °C for 2 min. Then, the solution was gradually cooled to facilitate annealing. The same oligonucleotides, which were not labeled, were annealed in the same way and used as a competitor. EMSA was performed using a LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce) according to the provider's protocol with modifications. Binding mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature in 20 μl of buffer containing 1× binding buffer (supplied in the kit), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnSO4, 7.5% glycerol, 10 ng/μl poly (dAdT) (Sigma), 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 4.5 μg of nuclear extract and 20 fmol of DNA probe. When competitor DNA was used, 4 pmol (200 molar excess) of DNA was added to the mixture. For antibody addition, antibody was pre-incubated with the mixture without the probe for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was electrophoresed in 4% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5× TBE buffer, and then transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche) using a semi-dry transfer blotter. Staining and detection procedures were carried out according to the kit protocol. ChIP was performed using a SimpleChIP Enzymatic Chromatin IP kit (Cell Signaling Technology). Approximately, 2 × 107 cells were used as starting material. 1% of the chromatin was reserved as input sample before immunoprecipitation. For detection, real-time PCR was performed. For tissue ChIP, 10-week-old C57BL/6 female mice were first deeply anesthetized and then sacrificed. Organs were collected and immediately minced on ice. Tissue pieces (200 mg) were incubated in 1% formaldehyde/PBS for 10 min, and then glycine was added (125 mm at final concentration) followed by incubation for 5 min. After washing twice with PBS, the tissues were homogenized in 4 ml of buffer A (supplied in the kit) with a Dounce homogenizer. Subsequent procedures were carried out as for cultured cells. All the animal experiments were approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of RIKEN. 3T3-L1 and Neuro2A cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Putative binding proteins to a given DNA sequence were searched for using JASPAR CORE Vertebrata database and MatInspector. Total RNA from cultured cells was extracted using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Total RNA from adult C57BL/6 mice was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) with random hexamers. Primers used for RT-PCR are listed in supplemental Fig. S8. Proteins were separated by 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE with the buffer system of Laemmli and then transferred to PVDF or nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 5% nonfat dried milk in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Proteins were detected with SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Scientific) using a Luminoimage Analyzer LAS-1000 (Fujifilm). For overexpression, cells, plated on 10-cm dishes at 80% confluency, were transfected with 4–8 μg of each expression vector using 10–20 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. After 4 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were used for other experiments. For knockdown, cells at 30% confluency on 10-cm dishes were transfected with 200 pmol of control siRNA (AllStars negative control siRNA, Qiagen) or mouse CTCF siRNA (5′-GGUGCAAUUGAGAACAUUATT-3′ and 5′-UAAUGUUCUCAAUUGCACCTG-3′) or mouse NeuroD1 siRNA (5′-CGAAUUUCGUGUAGCUGUATT-3′ and 5′-UACAGCUACACGAAAUUCGTG-3′) using 20 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. After 4 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium. 48 h post-transfection, cells were used for other experiments. For GnT-IX and GAPDH primers and probes, we used Assays-on-Demand gene expression products, and cDNAs were added to TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The probe for GnT-IX was labeled with FAM at its 5′-end and with quencher MGB at its 3′-end. The probe for GAPDH was labeled with VIC at its 5′-end and with quencher TAMRA at its 3′-end. The cDNAs were amplified by one cycle at 50 °C for 2 min, one cycle at 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min in a total volume of 20 μl using an ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The levels of GnT-IX mRNA were measured in duplicate and normalized to the corresponding GAPDH levels. For 3T3-L1 cells, the level of GnT-IX mRNA was indicated as a percentage relative to the level in Neuro2A cells, because endogenous GnT-IX mRNA was below the detectable limit in non-treated 3T3-L1 cells. ChIP products were quantified using the primers and probes in supplemental Fig. S8. Genomic DNA was amplified by one cycle at 50 °C for 2 min, one cycle at 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 62 °C for 1 min in a total volume of 20 μl. The amount of precipitated DNA was measured in duplicate and indicated as a relative percentage to the level of the input chromatin of each sample. These compounds were dissolved in DMSO. TSA and 5-Aza were added to the culture medium at final concentrations of 0.1 μm and 2.5 μm, respectively. In the control sample, the same amount of DMSO was added as vehicle. After 24 h, cells were used for subsequent experiments. For CTCF knockdown experiments, cells at 30% confluency were transfected with CTCF siRNA as described above. 24 h post-transfection, TSA was added to the culture medium, and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h before further analysis. Genomic DNA is extracted from mouse tissues using PureLink Genomic DNA Mini kit (Invitrogen). Unmethylated cytosines were converted to uracils using MethylCode Bisulfite Conversion kit (Invitrogen). The conversion reaction was carried out at 64 °C for 150 min using 100 ng of genomic DNA as a starting material. Then, a part of CpG island in GnT-IX promoter was amplified using MightyAmp DNA Polymerase (TAKARA) by one cycle at 98 °C for 2 min, and 42 cycles at 98 °C for 10 s, 50 °C for 20 s and 68 °C for 15 s, and then cloned and sequenced (8 clones for each tissue). Primers are ATGTTTTAGGAAGTTGTATGGTTTAG and CATTATTCCCTCTAAAAAAAC. To validate efficiency of the CT conversion, we used methylated plasmid DNA (pGV/−313 + 606). The plasmid was methylated by GCGC-specific methyltransferase HhaI (New England Biolabs), and then purified by phenol/chloroform extraction. Although human GnT-IX gene (MGAT5B) generates two mRNA sequences (10Inamori K. Endo T. Ide Y. Fujii S. Gu J. Honke K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which are generated by two alternative promoters (P1 for GnT-IX mRNA and P2 for GnT-Vb mRNA, Fig. 1A), our RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that P1-driven GnT-IX mRNA is the major form in normal brain (Fig. 1B). Consistently, P1 exhibited markedly higher promoter activity in neuroblastoma cells compared with P2 in luciferase assay (Fig. 1C). Based on these results, we focused on P1 and the GnT-IX mRNA isoform in this study. 5′-RACE revealed that GnT-IX mRNA are generated by several transcriptional start sites (TSS) (supplemental Fig. S1), and one of major TSSs are designated as +1. We detected endogenous GnT-IX mRNA in mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro2A), while 3T3-L1 cells showed no expression (Fig. 1D). Therefore, we used these cells to investigate how GnT-IX mRNA transcription is specifically regulated in the brain. We first expected GnT-IX expression to be controlled by neural specific chromatin structure, because epigenetic events play key roles for specific gene expression. To see if drugs that modify chromatin would affect GnT-IX expression, we first treated GnT-IX-negative cells (3T3-L1) with a HDAC inhibitor, TSA (20Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to forcibly remodel chromatin structure. We confirmed by ChIP analysis that TSA treatment caused a marked increase of acetylation on histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac), which corresponds to a typical active chromatin mark, around the GnT-IX TSS (Fig. 2A, left). Concomitantly, TSA treatment strongly induced GnT-IX transcription in 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 2A, right). We also treated the cells with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-Aza (22Jones P.A. Taylor S.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 85-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar), but 5-Aza treatment produced only slight GnT-IX induction. Moreover, bisulfite sequencing of genomic DNA from mouse tissues revealed that CpG sites in GnT-IX promoter are barely methylated in all tissues tested including brain (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that chromatin activation associated with histone modification but not with DNA hypo-methylation seems to be pivotal for GnT-IX transcription. From these results, we speculated that the histone tail modifications around the GnT-IX TSS region would be different between neural and non-neural cells. We, therefore, examined histone code-based chromatin activation state around the GnT-IX core promoter and the TSS region by ChIP analysis in Neuro2A and 3T3-L1 cells. In Neuro2A cells the GnT-IX TSS region was highly co-precipitated with antibodies against active chromatin marks, such as H3K9ac and trimethylated H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) (Fig. 2C, top), whereas in 3T3-L1 cells the same genomic region was highly associated with repressive chromatin marks, such as trimethylated H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and dimethylated H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) (Fig. 2C, bottom). Moreover, by tissue-ChIP analysis, we found that the same genomic region was highly associated with an active chromatin mark in mouse brain and with a repressive chromatin mark in other tissues such as liver and kidney (Fig. 2D). These results strongly suggest that the chromatin of the GnT-IX core promoter and TSS region is open and in a highly active state, specifically in neural cells, which correlates well with the predominant neural expression of GnT-IX. We next attempted the identification of transcription factors that bind to and drive the GnT-IX promoter. We cloned P1 as a 4.7 kb fragment extending upstream from the initiation ATG. We then generated serial deletion constructs and performed luciferase assays using 3T3-L1 and Neuro2A cells (Fig. 3A). The promoter activities of all the constructs tested were higher in Neuro2A cells. Although no obvious enhancer elements were found in the region upstream from −313 (Fig. S2), we found that deletion of −79 to −53 dramatically reduced promoter activity in Neuro2A cells (Fig. 3A), indicating that this element close to the TSS is important for GnT-IX expression. Bioinformatic analysis showed that this element has several consensus binding sites for DNA binding proteins (Fig. 3B). We then introduced point mutations within this element as shown in Fig. 3B and again performed luciferase assays. When we mutated the central CAG sequence (mut2), which is critical for binding of several transcription factors, including CTCF (23Schmidt D. Schwalie P.C. Ross-Innes C.S. Hurtado A. Brown G.D. Carroll J.S. Flicek P. Odom D.T. Genome Res. 2010; 20: 578-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and E-box binding proteins (N-myc, ZEB1 etc.), the promoter activity was drastically reduced in Neuro2A cells (Fig. 3C). A similar mutation (mut3), which is considered to disrupt the CTCF-site and E-box also significantly reduced the promoter activity. While another mutation (mut1 or 4), that is considered to have less or no impact on the binding of these transcription factors, had a little or no effect on the GnT-IX promoter activity. This suggests that these factors may bind to the promoter to regulate GnT-IX expression. Next, to identify proteins that bind to this sequence, EMSA were performed using an oligonucleotide that contained the identified element. Several nuclear proteins bound to this oligonucleotide, and this binding was completely inhibited by non-labeled competitor (Fig. 3D, left panel). To identify the proteins, we used several antibodies against candidate transcription factors (Fig. 3D, right panel). Addition of an anti-CTCF antibody reduced the signal intensity of the middle band. Moreover, overexpression of CTCF in Neuro2A cells clearly increased the signal intensity of this band (supplemental Fig. S3A). Based on these results, we concluded that CTCF was identified as a binding protein in vitro. We next analyzed the binding of CTCF to the GnT-IX promoter region in vivo using the ChIP assay. As shown in Fig. 3E, left graph, CTCF binding was observed in both Neuro2A and 3T3-L1 cells. Intriguingly, binding intensity appeared to be higher in Neuro2A than in 3T3-L1 cells, although the in vitro binding of CTCF in the EMSA experiment was comparable in these cell lines (Fig. 3D, left panel). Similarly, we demonstrated by tissue-ChIP that CTCF was enriched at the GnT-IX promoter in mouse brain (Fig. 3E, right graph). These observations suggest that CTCF may be preferentially recruited to the GnT-IX promoter region in neural cells. Considering the close proximity of the CTCF site to TSS, our ChIP analysis of histone modifications indicates that chromatin around the CTCF site is also activated in neural cells. We, therefore, assumed that CTCF binding to the GnT-IX promoter would be dependent on chromatin activation status. To test this hypothesis, we examined the CTCF binding after forced chromatin activation by TSA in 3T3-L1 cells. As expected, CTCF was highly recruited to the GnT-IX promoter after forced chromatin activation (Fig. 3F), indicating that CTCF binding to the GnT-IX promoter depends on chromatin activation state. CTCF has recently been reported to have multiple functions, including transcriptional regulation and insulation (24Phillips J.E. Corces V.G. Cell. 2009; 137: 1194-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). To examine whether CTCF regulates GnT-IX transcription, CTCF was overexpressed or knocked down by siRNA in Neuro2A cells and GnT-IX promoter activity was measured (supplemental Fig. S3, B and C). Overexpression of CTCF enhanced promoter activity, while siRNA treatment significantly reduced promoter activity, indicating that CTCF positively regulates GnT-IX transcription. To assess whether CTCF actually regulates endogenous GnT-IX expression in vivo, CTCF was knocked down by siRNA in Neuro2A cells and then GnT-IX mRNA levels were quantified by real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, when CTCF protein was suppressed to be ∼8% of the control level, the level of GnT-IX mRNA was reduced to ∼60% of control, indicating that CTCF positively regulates GnT-IX transcription in vivo. To further demonstrate the importance of CTCF for GnT-IX transcription, 3T3-L1 cells were treated with TSA after CTCF knockdown (Fig. 4C). In CTCF-depleted cells, up-regulation of GnT-IX mRNA by TSA was suppressed compared with TSA-treated control cells (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that transcription of GnT-IX is mediated by the binding of CTCF. We showed that depletion of CTCF by siRNA had a definite but limited effect on GnT-IX expression. Also, CTCF is almost ubiquitously expressed (25Loukinov D.I. Pugacheva E. Vatolin S. Pack S.D. Moon H. Chernukhin I. Mannan P. Larsson E. Kanduri C. Vostrov A.A. Cui H. Niemitz E.L. Rasko J.E.

https://openalex.org/W1968652594,"The mitochondrial import receptor Tom70 contains a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) clamp domain, which allows the receptor to interact with the molecular chaperones, Hsc70/Hsp70 and Hsp90. Preprotein recognition by Tom70, a critical step to initiate import, is dependent on these cytosolic chaperones. Preproteins are subsequently released from the receptor for translocation across the outer membrane, yet the mechanism of this step is unknown. Here, we report that Tom20 interacts with the TPR clamp domain of Tom70 via a conserved C-terminal DDVE motif. This interaction was observed by cross-linking endogenous proteins on the outer membrane of mitochondria from HeLa cells and in co-precipitation and NMR titrations with purified proteins. Upon mutation of the TPR clamp domain or deletion of the DDVE motif, the interaction was impaired. In co-precipitation experiments, the Tom20-Tom70 interaction was inhibited by C-terminal peptides from Tom20, as well as from Hsc70 and Hsp90. The Hsp90-Tom70 interaction was measured with surface plasmon resonance, and the same peptides inhibited the interaction. Thus, Tom20 competes with the chaperones for Tom70 binding. Interestingly, antibody blocking of Tom20 did not increase the efficiency of Tom70-dependent preprotein import; instead, it impaired the Tom70 import pathway in addition to the Tom20 pathway. The functional interaction between Tom20 and Tom70 may be required at a later step of the Tom70-mediated import, after chaperone docking. We suggest a novel model in which Tom20 binds Tom70 to facilitate preprotein release from the chaperones by competition."
https://openalex.org/W2003103534,"The RecA-dependent DNA damage response pathway (SOS response) appears to be the major DNA repair mechanism in most bacteria, but it has been suggested that a RecA-independent mechanism is responsible for controlling expression of most damage-inducible DNA repair genes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The specific reparative responses and molecular mediators involved in the DNA repair mechanism remain largely unclear in this pathogen and its related species. In this study, a mycobacterial ClpR-like regulator, corresponding to Rv2745c in M. tuberculosis and to Ms2694 in M. smegmatis mc(2)155, was found to interact with the promoter regions of multiple damage-inducible DNA repair genes. Specific binding of the ClpR-like factor to the conserved RecA-independent promoter RecA-NDp motif was then confirmed using in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays as well as in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. The ClpR knock-out experiments, in combination with quantitative real time PCR assays, demonstrated that the expression of these RecA-independent genes were significantly down-regulated in the mutant strain of M. smegmatis in response to a DNA-damaging agent compared with the wild type strain. Furthermore, the ClpR-like factor was shown to contribute to mycobacterial genomic stability. These results enhance our understanding of the function of the ClpR regulator and the regulatory mechanism of RecA-independent DNA repair in mycobacteria."

Despite the importance of iloprost in human therapy, the identity of the receptors for this drug remains to be further elucidated. Although iloprost was originally identified to function through the cell surface prostacyclin receptor (7Namba T. Oida H. Sugimoto Y. Kakizuka A. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9986-9992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), several lines of evidence indicate that iloprost is also associated with the PPAR pathway (8Hertz R. Berman I. Keppler D. Bar-Tana J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,9Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). The three PPAR subtypes (α, β/δ, and γ) are ligand-regulated transcription factors that belong to a nuclear receptor family involved in many aspects of human physiology (10Barger P.M. Kelly D.P. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 11Glass C.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As such, PPARs are effective targets for many therapeutic uses. The pharmacologic actions of PPARs are mediated first through their LBDs, which bind ligands, then recruit nuclear receptor coactivators (or corepressors) to regulate expression of the downstream target genes. Interestingly, PPARs have been revealed as important regulators in angiogenesis (12Barger P.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 13Biscetti F. Pola R. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 7-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Indeed, some effects of iloprost in vivo, like angiogenesis and up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor, function through PPARα-dependent mechanisms (14Pola R. Gaetani E. Flex A.

In addition, PPARδ is required for the antiapoptotic action of PGI2 in endothelial cells (16Liou J.Y. Lee S. Ghelani D. Matijevic-Aleksic N. Wu K.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1481-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Several eicosanoids have been shown to function through the PPAR signaling pathway (9Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl.

For example, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 was implicated as a natural ligand for PPARγ, whereas eicosapentaenoic acid is able to bind all three PPARs (20Xu H.E. Lambert M.H. Montana V.G. Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Lehmann J.M. Wisely G.B. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Milburn M.V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether iloprost binds directly to PPARs because the binding experiments failed to demonstrate the direct interaction between iloprost and PPARα (8Hertz R. Berman I. Keppler D. Bar-Tana J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Moreover, the selectivity of iloprost toward PPAR subtypes has remained puzzling to date. Clearly, the molecular basis for the interaction between PPARs and iloprost needs to be defined further to develop a PGI2-based drug design strategy targeting PPARs with more efficacious and combinatorial therapeutic potentials. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of iloprost-regulated PPAR activity, we first determined the cofactor-binding profiles for PPARγ in response to iloprost using biochemical peptide profiling. To uncover the molecular mechanism for the binding selectivity of PPARs to iloprost, the high resolution crystal structures of the PPARα LBD and PPARδ LBD complexed with iloprost were determined, respectively. Through a combination of mutagenesis, biochemical binding studies, and structural analysis, we revealed the molecular basis for the selectivity of PPARα/δ among all three PPARs for the binding of iloprost, thus providing critical perspective regarding the differential roles of three PPAR subtypes in prostacyclin signaling and cardiovascular therapeutic effects. The human PPARα LBD (residues 196–468) and PPARδ LBD (residues 170–441) were expressed as N-terminal His6 fusion protein from the expression vector pET24a (Novagen). BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with each expression plasmid were grown in LB broth at 25 °C to an A600 of ∼1.0 and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 16 °C. Cells were harvested, resuspended, and sonicated in 200 ml of extract buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 25 mm imadazole) per 6 liters of cells. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant was loaded on a 5-ml NiSO4-loaded HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with extract buffer, and the protein was eluted with a gradient of 25–500 mm imidazole. The PPARα LBD and the PPARδ LBD were further purified with a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). To prepare the protein-ligand complex, we added a 5-fold excess of the iloprost ligand to the purified protein, followed by filter concentration to 10 mg/ml. The PPARα LBD was complexed with 2-fold of PGC-1β peptide (VDELSLLQKLLLATS) before filter concentration. The crystals of the PPARα-iloprost complex were grown at room temperature in hanging drops containing 1.0 μl of the above protein-peptide solutions and 1.0 μl of well buffer containing 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0, and 20% PEG 3350, whereas the crystals of PPARδ-iloprost complex were grown in the well buffer containing 20% PEG 5000, 2% tacsimate, pH 5.0, 5% glycerol, and 100 mm sodium citrate. The crystals were directly flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection. Diffraction data were collected with a MAR225 CCD detector at the ID line of sector-21 at the Advanced Photon Source. The observed reflections were reduced, merged, and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK in the HKL2000 package (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The structures were determined by molecular replacement in the CCP4 suite. The search model for PPARα-iloprost is the 1K7L, whereas the model for PPARδ-iloprost is 3GWX in Protein Data Bank(20Xu H.E. Lambert M.H. Montana V.G. Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Brown P.J.

Manual model building was carried out with COOT (22Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23226) Google Scholar), followed by REFMAC refinement in the CCP4 suite. The binding of the various peptide motifs to PPAR LBDs in response to ligands was determined by AlphaScreenTM assays using a hexahistidine detection kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences as described before (23Li Y. Choi M. Cavey G. Daugherty J. Suino K. Kovach A. Bingham N.C. Kliewer S.A. Xu H.E. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 491-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The experiments were conducted with ∼20–40 nm receptor LBD and 20 nm biotinylated cofactor peptides in the presence of 5 μg/ml donor and acceptor beads in a buffer containing 50 mm MOPS, 50 mm NaF, 0.05 mm CHAPS, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA, all adjusted to pH 7.4. The peptides with an N-terminal biotinylation were as follows: SRC1–2, SPSSHSSLTERHKILHRLLQEGSP; SRC2–3, QEPVSPKKKENALLRYLLDKDDTKD; PGC-1α-1, AEEPSLLKKLLLAPA; CBP-1, SGNLVPDAASKHKQLSELLRGGSG; and NCOR-2, GHSFADPASNLGLEDIIRKALMGSF. COS-7 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) (24Li Y. Suino K. Daugherty J. Xu H.E. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). All mutant PPAR plasmids were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). 24-well plates were plated 24 h prior to transfection (5 × 104 cells/well). For native promoter reporter assays, the cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding full-length nuclear receptors and their cognate luciferase reporters as follows: human PPARs (α, δ, and γ) and PPAR response element-Luc; human RORα or RORγ and the Pcp2/ROR response element-Luc reporter; human glucocorticoid receptor or androgen receptor and the MMTV-Luc; human liver X receptors and TK-LXREx3-Luc; human farnesoid X receptor, and ecdysone response element-Luc. Ligands were added 5 h after transfection. Cells were harvested 24 h later for the luciferase assays. Luciferase data were normalized to Renilla activity cotransfected as an internal control. To probe the physiological roles of iloprost on PPAR signaling, we first characterize the transcriptional properties of PPARs in response to iloprost. COS-7 cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding three PPARs and various other nuclear receptor full-length receptors, respectively, together with their cognate response reporters. Consistent with previous observations, iloprost showed strong agonist activity on PPARα and PPARδ, but not on PPARγ and a variety of other nuclear receptors tested, including farnesoid X receptor, liver X receptor α and β, retinoic acid-related receptor α and γ (RORα and RORγ), mineralocorticoid receptor, or glucocorticoid receptor (Fig. 1A). Further, full dose curves revealed that iloprost activated PPARα and PPARδ in a concentration-dependent manner with an approximate EC50 of 200 nm range, suggesting that iloprost is a potent PPARα/δ dual agonist (Fig. 1B). To unravel the biochemical mechanism of PPARα/δ activation by iloprost, we determined the ability of iloprost to promote recruitment of coactivator LXXLL motifs by PPARα/δ using AlphaScreen biochemical assay, which is a widely used assay to detect ligand-dependent interaction between nuclear receptors and their coactivators(23Li Y. Choi M. Cavey G. Daugherty J. Suino K. Kovach A. Bingham N.C. Kliewer S.A. Xu H.E. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 491-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In this assay, the coactivator peptides and the three PPAR LBD proteins were, respectively, attached to donor and acceptor beads. Upon the interactions between the coactivator peptides and the PPAR LBDs, excitation with a laser beam causes the donor beads to emit single-oxygen molecules that activate the fluorophores in the acceptor beads, and light is recorded as coregulator binding activity. As shown in Fig. 2, the treatment of iloprost strongly enhanced the interaction of PPARα/δ with various coactivator LXXLL motifs from the family of steroid receptor coactivators (SRC1–2 and SRC2–3), CBP (CBP-1), and PGC-1α (PGC-1α-1), but not a corepressor motif from NCOR (NCOR-2), indicating that iloprost functions as a PPARα/δ agonist (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, iloprost has no effect on coregulator recruitment by PPARγ (Fig. 2C). These results reaffirm that iloprost is a selective PPARα/δ dual agonist and strongly suggest a direct binding of iloprost with PPARα/δ. To determine the molecular basis for the selective binding of iloprost by PPARs, we solved the crystal structures of iloprost complexed with PPARα and PPARδ, respectively (Table 1). The structures reveal that the PPARα LBD-iloprost displays a monomeric fold (Fig. 3A) whereas PPARδ LBD-iloprost forms a dimer complex with the helix 10 from each monomer forming a dimer interface (Fig. 3B). Both PPARα-iloprost and PPARδ-iloprost are folded into three-layer helical sandwiches, with the C-terminal AF-2 helix positioned in the active conformation, in agreement with the agonist nature of the iloprost ligand. The binding mode of iloprost to PPARα/δ was apparent from the highly revealing electron density map shown in Fig. 3, C and D. The iloprost adapts in the center of the ligand-binding pocket and adopts essentially the same configuration for both PPARα and PPARδ. The binding of iloprost to PPARα/δ was stabilized by a combination of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions in a similar manner (Figs. 3, C and D, and 4). All of the contacts between the iloprost ligand and receptors closely resemble each other for both PPARα and PPARδ.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsParametersPPARδ-IloPPARα-Ilo-PGC-1βData collectionSpace groupP21P21Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)49.12, 111.90, 55.0144.84, 60.97, 54.16β, β, γ (°)90.0, 93.15, 90.090.0, 108.9, 90.0Resolution (Å)50.00-2.23 (2.27-2.23)aValues in parentheses are for highest resolution shell.50.00-2.21 (2.25-2.21)RsymbRsym=Σ|Iavg − Ii|/ΣI.0.115 (0.246)0.070 (0.199)I/σ34.4 (3.9)53.5 (10.5)Completeness (%)99.2 (96.6)99.6 (95.0)Redundancy5.9 (5.1)4.9 (4.3)RefinementResolution (Å)36.90-2.3028.40-2.21No. reflections26,19113,835Rwork/RfreecRfactor = Σ|FP − FPcalc|/ΣFp, where Fp and Fpcalc are observed and calculated structure factors, Rfree was calculated from a randomly chosen 8% of reflections excluded from refinement, and Rfactor was calculated for the remaining 92% of reflections.19.1/25.917.6/23.9No. atomsProtein4,3312,221Ligand/ion5226Water40393B factorsProtein20.537.8Ligand/ion16.842.9Water23.640.8R.m.s.d.dR.m.s.d. is the root mean square deviation from ideal geometry.Bond lengths (Å)0.0080.008Bond angles (°)1.21.1a Values in parentheses are for highest resolution shell.b Rsym=Σ|Iavg − Ii|/ΣI.c Rfactor = Σ|FP − FPcalc|/ΣFp, where Fp and Fpcalc are observed and calculated structure factors, Rfree was calculated from a randomly chosen 8% of reflections excluded from refinement, and Rfactor was calculated for the remaining 92% of reflections.d R.m.s.d. is the root mean square deviation from ideal geometry.

The acidic head group of iloprost forms several hydrogen bonds with the surrounding PPARα residues, including Tyr-314 from helix 5, His-440 from helix 10, and Tyr-464 from helix 12 (Figs. 4A and 5A). These interactions are also observed between iloprost and PPARδ, thus supporting a critical conserved mechanism for ligand-mediated activation of PPARs (Fig. 4B). Indeed, the Y464L mutation decreases the activation of PPARα by both iloprost and PPARα-selective ligand GW735 in cell-based assays using a PPARα response reporter, highlighting the importance of these hydrogen-bond interactions in ligand binding (Fig. 5E). In addition to conserved contacts for all PPARα ligands, iloprost also initiates several specific interactions with PPARs using its unique structural groups. The hydrophobic side chain of Met-355 stabilizes ligand binding by making hydrophobic interactions with iloprost backbone (Figs. 4A and 5B). Mutation of this residue decreased PPARα activation by iloprost but had no effects on PPARα activation by PPARα ligand GW735 that has a hydrophilic group at this corresponding position (25Sierra M.L. Beneton V. Boullay A.B. Boyer T. Brewster A.G. Donche F. Forest M.C. Fouchet M.H. Gellibert F.J. Grillot D.A. Lambert M.H. Laroze A. Le Grumelec C. Linget J.M. Montana V.G. Nguyen V.L. Nicodème E. Patel V. Penfornis A. Pineau O. Pohin D. Potvain F. Poulain G. Ruault C.B. Saunders M. Toum J. Xu H.E. Xu R.X. Pianetti P.M. J. Med. Chem. 2007; 50: 685-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), highlighting the differential roles of this residue in recognizing iloprost and other PPARα ligands like GW735 (Fig. 5, B and E). Notably, two unique hydroxy groups from iloprost form hydrogen bonds with Thr-279 and Ser-280 of PPARα, respectively, thereby facilitating the iloprost binding to this nuclear receptor (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, the similar interactions were also observed between iloprost and PPARδ at corresponding positions of Thr-252 and Thr-253, whereas PPARα ligand GW735 and PPARδ ligand GW0472 do not form such interactions (Fig. 5, C and D). To validate further the specific impact of these hydrogen bonds on iloprost binding, we mutated these serine and threonine residues in the ligand-binding pocket surrounding the hydroxy groups of iloprost for both PPARα and PPARδ. Accordingly, all of these mutations significantly decreased the activation of both PPARα and PPARδ by iloprost but not by PPARα ligand GW735 or PPARδ ligand GW0472, respectively (Fig. 5E). Together, these data reveal the important roles of diverse interactions in the specific binding of iloprost by PPARα and PPARδ. The inactivity of iloprost to bind PPARγ raises questions as to the molecular basis for the binding selectivity of this ligand toward PPARα/δ, considering high sequence and structural homology among all three PPARs (26Xu H.E. Lambert M.H. Montana V.G. Plunket K.D. Moore L.B. Collins J.L. Oplinger J.A. Kliewer S.A. Gampe Jr., R.T. McKee D.D. Moore J.T. Willson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 13919-13924Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Notably, they all have three-arm and Y-shaped ligand-binding pockets and similar pocket size (27Li Y. Lambert M.H. Xu H.E. Structure. 2003; 11: 741-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Structural comparison revealed three key residues from the PPARγ LBD different from PPARα/δ that define a unique characteristic of the PPARγ ligand-binding pocket that discriminates the iloprost binding. PPARγ LBD contains two polar residues Tyr-327 from helix 5 (Fig. 6, A and D) and Ser-342 between helix 5 and helix 6 (Fig. 6, B and D) that show conflicts with hydrophobic nature of the iloprost backbone. Mutations of these two residues to the corresponding ones shared by both PPARα and PPARδ enable PPARγ to respond to iloprost treatment (Fig. 6E). Another key pocket residue is Phe-363 located immediate before helix 7 of PPARγ LBD (Fig. 6, C and D). Compared with the smaller isoleucine side chain in the corresponding positions of PPARα/δ, the bulky phenylalanine is predicted to interfere with the iloprost binding by reducing the pocket size. As expected, iloprost activated the transcriptional activity of PPARγ mutant carrying F363I mutation in contrast to wild-type PPARγ (Fig. 6E). Of note, all of these mutations have no effect on the transcriptional activity of PPARγ in response to ligand rosiglitazone (Fig. 6E). As such, these functional mutations reveal the important roles of the specific hydrophobic interactions with the backbone of iloprost in the selectivity of PPARα/δ for ligand binding among all three PPARs. The functional interaction between iloprost and PPAR receptors is critical for understanding its pharmacologic mechanisms as an important therapeutic agent. Here, we conducted detailed analysis of the binding between iloprost and coactivators by a combination of biochemical binding assay, mutagenesis, and structural analysis. Biochemical studies indicate that iloprost functions as a selective PPARα/δ dual agonist by inducing coactivator binding to these nuclear receptors. The crystal structures of PPARs bound to iloprost further provide an unambiguous evidence for the direct binding of iloprost with PPARα and PPARδ, shedding light on the molecular pathway of this important prostacyclin drug. In addition to conserved binding mechanisms, structural analysis also revealed specific binding of PPARα and PPARδ by iloprost through its unique structural features distinct from other PPAR ligands. Because both iloprost and PPARα/δ are involved in many physiological activities, the structure and functional relationships of iloprost and PPARα/δ signaling provide new opportunities for novel PGI2-based drug development with improved selectivity that can differentiate and enhance individual clinical effect associated with iloprost such as angiogenesis. The three PPAR subtypes (α, δ, and γ) are characterized as nuclear receptors with not only high sequence homology but also different expression pattern, reflecting distinct but also overlapping roles of the three PPARs played in human physiology (28Michalik L. Auwerx J. Berger J.P. Chatterjee V.K. Glass C.K. Gonzalez F.J. Grimaldi P.A. Kadowaki T. Lazar M.A. O'Rahilly S. Palmer C.N. Plutzky J. Reddy J.K. Spiegelman B.M. Staels B. Wahli W. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 726-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Indeed, these PPARs display differential activity profiles in response to various ligands, including eicosanoids (17Yu K. Bayona W.

Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Our observations also provide an explanation for why iloprost preferentially activates PPARα and PPARδ rather than the PPARγ subtypes. The molecular basis for the selectivity of PPARα/δ for binding iloprost thus provides critical perspective regarding the differential roles of three PPAR subtypes in prostacyclin signaling and cardiovascular therapeutic effects. Based on the above structural observations, PPARα/δ utilizes both conserved and also unique epitopes that dictate the discrimination iloprost binding from other PPAR ligands. The differential ligand binding modes of PPARα/δ versus PPARγ may allow the modulation of distinct ligand binding selectivity and affinity, thereby affecting diverse physiological outcome of different PPAR ligands. As such, the structural mechanism may provide a more rational template for designing novel compounds targeting PPARs with more favorable pharmacologic impact based on existing iloprost drugs.

https://openalex.org/W1979187576,"Carma1, a caspase recruitment domain-containing membrane-associated guanylate kinase, initiates a unique signaling cascade via Bcl10 and Malt1 in NK cells. Carma1 deficiency results in reduced phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and activation of NF-κB that lead to impaired NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine production. However, the precise identities of the downstream signaling molecules that link Carma1 to these effector functions were not defined. Here we show that transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is abundantly present in NK cells, and activation via NKG2D results in its phosphorylation. Lack of Carma1 considerably reduced TAK1 phosphorylation, demonstrating the dependence of TAK1 on Carma1 in NKG2D-mediated NK cell activations. Pharmacological inhibitor to TAK1 significantly reduced NK-mediated cytotoxicity and its potential to generate IFN-γ, GM-CSF, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES. Conditional in vivo knockdown of TAK1 in NK cells from Mx1Cre(+)TAK1(fx/fx) mice resulted in impaired NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine/chemokine production. Inhibition or conditional knockdown of TAK1 severely impaired the NKG2D-mediated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 and activation of NF-κB and AP1. Our results show that TAK1 links Carma1 to NK cell-mediated effector functions."
https://openalex.org/W2039557986,"In eukaryotic cells, maintenance of cellular ATP stores depends mainly on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which in turn requires sufficient cellular oxygenation. The crucial role of proper oxygenation for cellular viability is reflected by involvement of several mechanisms, which sense hypoxia and regulate activities of respiratory complexes according to available oxygen concentrations. Here, we focus on mouse nitric oxide-associated protein 1 (mNOA1), which has been identified as an important component of the machinery that adjusts OXPHOS activity to oxygen concentrations. mNOA1 is an evolutionary conserved GTP-binding protein that is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial protein translation and respiration. We found that mNOA1 is located mostly in the mitochondrial matrix from where it interacts with several high molecular mass complexes, most notably with the complex IV of the respiratory chain and the prohibitin complex. Knock-down of mNOA1 impaired enzyme activity I+III, resulting in oxidative stress and eventually cell death. mNOA1 is transcriptionally regulated in an oxygen-sensitive manner. We propose that oxygen-dependent regulation of mNOA1 is instrumental to adjusting OXPHOS activity to oxygen availability, thereby controlling mitochondrial metabolism."

These studies together with mass spectrometric characterization of the YbaK-catalyzed reaction products support a novel substrate-assisted mechanism of Cys-tRNAPro deacylation that prevents nonspecific Pro-tRNAPro hydrolysis. Collectively, we propose that the INS and YbaK domains co-evolved distinct mechanisms involving steric exclusion and thiol-specific chemistry, respectively, to ensure accurate decoding of proline codons. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases attach specific amino acids to cognate tRNAs. Prolyl-tRNA synthetases are known to mischarge tRNAPro with the smaller amino acid alanine and with cysteine, which is the same size as proline. Quality control in proline codon translation is partly ensured by an editing domain (INS) present in most bacterial prolyl-tRNA synthetases that hydrolyzes smaller Ala-tRNAPro and excludes Pro-tRNAPro. In contrast, Cys-tRNAPro is cleared by a freestanding INS domain homolog, YbaK. Here, we have investigated the molecular mechanism of catalysis and substrate recognition by Hemophilus influenzae YbaK using site-directed mutagenesis, enzymatic assays of isosteric substrates and functional group analogs, and computational modeling.

Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). The first step involves amino acid activation with ATP to form an aminoacyl-adenylate intermediate and concomitant pyrophosphate release. The second step involves aminoacyl transfer to the cognate tRNA via a transesterification reaction. Although aaRSs display high substrate specificity, they often misactivate structurally similar amino acids. If left unchecked, these mistakes lead to errors in protein synthesis, and accumulation of such errors can be deleterious to cells (2Lee J.W. Beebe K. Nangle L.A. Jang J. Longo-Guess C.M. Cook S.A.

To ensure high fidelity in translation, aaRSs have evolved several proofreading mechanisms (4Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hendrickson T.L. de Crécy-Lagard V. Schimmel P. Annu. Rev.

In the first type of proofreading, misactivated aminoacyl-adenylates are enzymatically hydrolyzed or selectively released from the active site followed by solvent hydrolysis, in a process termed “pretransfer” editing. Another mechanism of proofreading known as “post-transfer” editing is generally believed to function via the so-called “double-sieve” mechanism (8Fersht A.R. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. Freeman, San Francisco1977Google Scholar). The model predicted that, whereas one active site could not completely discriminate Ile and Val, two separate active sites with distinct strategies for recognition could significantly enhance fidelity. The aminoacylation active site of the aaRS would act as a “coarse” sieve for adenylate synthesis, activating the cognate amino acid but also allowing, to a lesser extent, activation of isosteric or smaller amino acids that could fit into the amino acid binding pocket. The second “fine” sieve would selectively bind misactivated amino acids for editing while excluding the original cognate amino acid. Thus, substrates synthesized in the first sieve would be further screened by the second sieve to enhance fidelity. Subsequently, biochemical and structural data validated this steric exclusion mechanism for valyl-tRNA synthetase and isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (9Fersht A.R. Dingwall C.

A recent study of AlaRS revealed an exception to the size exclusion-based double-sieve model of editing. In this case, a coordinated zinc ion in the editing site of AlaRS may help provide specificity for non-cognate serine, which is larger than cognate alanine (20Sokabe M. Okada A. Yao M. Nakashima T.

Insights into the relative contributions of pre- and post-transfer editing have also begun to emerge in several Class I and Class II synthetase systems (22Boniecki M.T. Vu M.T. Betha A.K.

Due to its unique side chain with special chemical properties, cysteine should be relatively easy for synthetases to discriminate. Similarly, proline is the only imino acid and would not be predicted to be especially problematic. Paradoxically, ProRSs from all domains of life confuse cysteine for proline (27Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30779-30785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 28Ahel I. Stathopoulos C. Ambrogelly A. Sauerwald A. Toogood H. Hartsch T. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34743-34748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). ProRSs also misactivate alanine, and the majority of bacterial ProRSs possess an editing domain (INS) that can edit mischarged Ala-tRNAPro but not Cys-tRNAPro (17Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 29An S. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42359-42362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We imagine that the smaller size of alanine relative to proline facilitates binding and catalysis by INS, whereas the editing domain rejects cysteine, which is very similar to proline in molecular volume (30Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties. Freeman, New York1996Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, the Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicus (31Kamtekar S. Kennedy W.D. Wang J. Stathopoulos C. Söll D. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1673-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and Rhodopseudomonas palustris (16Crepin T. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Cusack S. Structure. 2006; 14: 1511-1525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) ProRS structures solved in complex with Cys- and Pro-sulfamoyl-adenylates showed that the aminoacylation active site of ProRS could accommodate both adenylates in a very similar manner. Thus, it is likely that a distinct post-transfer editing mechanism that does not rely on steric exclusion is needed to clear mischarged Cys-tRNAPro. Indeed, the latter is hydrolyzed by a freestanding domain known as YbaK, which is proposed to function in collaboration with ProRS in trans (29An S. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42359-42362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 32Ruan B. Söll D. J. Biol.

Members of the YbaK superfamily share significant sequence and structural homology with the INS domain of bacterial ProRS (16Crepin T. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Cusack S.

Interestingly, in contrast to YbaK, the freestanding PrdX domain within the YbaK superfamily possesses the same substrate specificity for Ala-tRNAPro as the INS domain (37Ahel I. Korencic D. Ibba M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 15422-15427Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Freestanding editing domains have also been identified based on homology to the AlaRS and threonyl-tRNA synthetase editing domains. AlaXs generally display the same Ser- and Gly-tRNAAla editing specificity as the AlaRS protein (20Sokabe M. Okada A. Yao M. Nakashima T. Tanaka I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Thus, to date, YbaK is the only known editing domain homolog with distinct substrate specificity relative to the homologous synthetase domain. Although the phenomenon of post-transfer editing in aaRSs is well established, relatively little is known about the detailed hydrolysis mechanism of freestanding editing proteins like YbaK at the molecular level (6Mascarenhas A.P.

We were especially interested in understanding the basis for the unique Cys-tRNA specificity of YbaK and how discrimination of similar sized Pro-tRNA is achieved. The x-ray crystal structures of several members of the YbaK superfamily (PrdX, ProX, YbaK, and ProRS INS) from a variety of organisms (Protein Data Bank codes 2DXA, 1DBX, 1VJF, 1WDV, 1VKI, 2CX5, 2ZOX, 2ZOK and 2J3L) have been solved (16Crepin T.

To understand the chemical basis of the distinct substrate specificities of these homologous editing domains, we investigated the mechanism of YbaK hydrolysis. Collectively, our experimental and computational data support a mechanism of catalysis that exploits the special side chain chemistry of cysteine. All amino acids and chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. [3H]Alanine (54 Ci/mmol), [3H]proline (99 Ci/mmol), [3H]serine (33 Ci/mmol), and α-[32P]ATP were from Amersham Biosciences, and [35S]cysteine (1075 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Multiple-sequence alignments were performed using the ClustalW multiple-sequence realignment program (45Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of monomeric H. influenzae YbaK was used as the starting structure (Protein Data Bank entry 1DBX) (35Zhang H. Huang K. Li Z. Banerjei L. Fisher K.E. Grishin N.V. Eisenstein E. Herzberg O. Proteins Struct. Funct. Bioinform. 2000; 40: 86-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Missing residues 25–29 (NNQHF) in the flexible loop region were added using the template-based loop structure prediction server ArchPRED (46Fernandez-Fuentes N. Zhai J. Fiser A.

Phys. Chem. A. 2005; 109: 6634-6643Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To relax the resulting structure and to sample the flexibility of the protein, 15 ns of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed in explicit solvent (TIP3P) (48Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (30557) Google Scholar) using AMBER 9 (49Case D.A. Darden T.A. Cheatham 3rd, T.E. Simmerling C.L. Wang J. Duke R.E.

Beroza P. Mathews D.H. Schafmeister C. Ross W.S. Kollman P.A. AMBER 9. University of California, San Francisco2006Google Scholar). Twenty-five snapshots of the protein structure from the resulting MD trajectory were extracted at equal time intervals and used for molecular docking. The structure of the 5′-CCA-Cys ligand was generated using the xleap module of AMBER 9. This ligand was docked onto the 25 structures of YbaK using AutoDock 4.0 (50Huey R. Morris G.M. Olson A.J. Goodsell D.S. J. Comput. Chem. 2007; 28: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). All of the ligand torsions were kept flexible, whereas the protein torsions were fixed. Each docking simulation involved generation of 200 different conformers, which were then clustered using a root mean square deviation cut-off of 2.0 Å. Resulting clusters were manually inspected, and the five docked structures most consistent with available mutagenesis data were chosen for further analysis. These structures were minimized using the ff99 force field in AMBER 9, followed by 15 ns of MD simulation. The complex structure displaying the most stable trajectory was selected for further analysis. The final complex structure was subjected to 15 ns of MD to obtain time-averaged distance information and identify long lived H-bonds. These analyses were performed using the ptraj module in AMBER 9. All of the proteins and tRNA substrates were prepared using published protocols as described in the supplemental Methods. To test the ability of YbaK to prevent mischarging of β-aminoalanine (β-Aa) onto tRNAPro, 1.5 μm editing-defective Escherichia coli K279A ProRS was incubated with 10 μm 3′-32P-labeled tRNAPro and 150 mm β-Aa in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 4 mm ATP, 20 mm KCl, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA at 37 °C, in the absence or presence of 6 μm YbaK. For each time point, 1.5 μl of reaction mixture was quenched into 4.5 μl of 200 mm NaOAc containing 0.4 unit/μl P1 nuclease at 4 °C. After digestion for 20 min at room temperature, 1 μl of quenched mixture was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate prerun with water. Separation of β-Aa-AMP and AMP was accomplished by developing the TLC in 0.1 m ammonium acetate and 5% acetic acid. The radioactivity was analyzed by using a Typhoon PhosphorImager, and data were analyzed using Bio-Rad Quantity One software. The fraction of free tRNA was determined from the ratio of AMP formed over the total AMP plus β-Aa-AMP. Preparation of aminoacyl-tRNAs for use in deacylation assays was carried out as described (29An S. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42359-42362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, [3H]Ser-tRNAPro was prepared by incubating 2 μm E. coli AlaRS-CQ and 8 μm E. coli G1:C72/U70 tRNAPro in a reaction mixture containing [3H]serine (9.1 μm) and unlabeled serine (0.5 mm) in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 4 mm ATP, 20 mm KCl, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 25 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. [3H]Ala-tRNAPro was prepared using E. coli WT AlaRS and G1:C72/U70 tRNAPro in a similar manner. [35S]Cys-tRNAPro was prepared by incubating E. coli ProRS (8 μm), E. coli tRNAPro (8 μm) with [35S]cysteine (0.9 μm) and unlabeled cysteine (50 μm) in a reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP as described previously. [35S]Cys-tRNACys was prepared by incubating E. coli cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CysRS) (30 nm) and E. coli tRNACys (8 μm) in the same reaction buffer. 3′-End-modified (2′-dA76 or 3′-dA76) E. coli tRNACys was charged with [35S]cysteine in a similar manner, except a higher concentration of E. coli CysRS (5 μm) was used. Sec-3′-[32P]tRNACys was prepared by incubating E. coli CysRS (2 μm) and E. coli tRNACys (10 μm) with freshly prepared 50 mm selenocysteine in a reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 2 mm ATP, and 50 mm tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0) at 37 °C for 1 h. A fresh solution of 140 mm selenocysteine was prepared immediately prior to use by dissolving seleno-l-cystine (Fluka) (11.7 mg, 0.035 mmol) in ∼40 μl of 0.2 n HCl. The diselenide bond was reduced in situ by the addition of an equal volume of 0.2 m tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) (51Hondal R.J. Nilsson B.L. Raines R.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5140-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The final volume (500 μl) was made up with 0.1 m tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), and the pH of the resulting solution was adjusted to ∼7.5–8.0 with a few drops of 14 n NaOH. During ethanol precipitation of the Sec-tRNA, 50 μl of 0.1 m tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine solution was added to prevent auto-oxidation. 2-aminobutyric acid (2-Abu)-3′-[32P]tRNAPro was prepared by incubating 1.5 μm E. coli K279A ProRS with 10 μm 3′-32P-labeled tRNAPro and 150 mm 2-Abu in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 4 mm ATP, 20 mm KCl, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA at 37 °C. Deacylation assays were generally carried out at 37 °C according to published protocols. Reactions contained ∼1.0 μm G1:C72/U70 [3H]Ala-tRNAPro, 1.0 μm G1:C72/U70 [3H]Ser-tRNAPro, 0.5 μm [35S]Cys-tRNAPro, 1.0 μm [3H]Pro-tRNAPro, 0.7 μm [35S]Cys-2′-dA76-tRNACys, and 0.5 μm [35S]Cys-3′-dA76-tRNACys. Reactions were initiated with 0.5–1.0 μm WT or mutant YbaK, quenched, and worked up as described (29An S. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42359-42362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A background reaction was carried out in which buffer (0.15 m KPO4, pH 7.0) was used to initiate the reaction for each substrate. For competition assays, various concentrations of G1:C72/U70 Ser-tRNAPro were mixed with 0.5 μm [35S]Cys-tRNAPro, and reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.1 μm YbaK. In other competition assays, Sec-tRNACys, Cys-2′-dA76-tRNACys, or Cys-tRNACys (∼6–8 μm each) were mixed with 0.5 μm [35S]Cys-tRNACys, and reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.5 μm YbaK. 2-Abu-[32P]tRNAPro, Sec-[32P]tRNACys, and Cys-[32P]tRNACys deacylation assays contained a 1 μm concentration of each tRNA and 0.5–5 μm YbaK. Reactions were quenched by adding 0.4 unit/μl P1 nuclease in 200 mm NaOAc, and the deacylation level was analyzed using polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC, as described previously (52Wolfson A.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5965-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The fraction of aminoacyl-tRNA remaining was plotted as a function of time and fitted to a single-exponential equation to obtain kobs. All assays were carried out in triplicate. In some cases, analysis of reaction products was performed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and LC/MS as described in the supplemental Methods. Freestanding domains with homology to the ProRS editing domain have been identified across a variety of species and can be grouped together to constitute a “YbaK superfamily.” In addition to the INS domain of bacterial ProRS, phylogenetic analysis using available sequences in the Protein Data Bank indicates that members of this superfamily include at least five distinct freestanding protein domains designated YbaK, YeaK, ProX, PrdX, and PA2301. Despite their relatively low sequence identity, these proteins possess high structural homology (16Crepin T. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Cusack S.

Whereas the INS domain specifically hydrolyzes Ala-tRNAPro, bacterial YbaK possesses post-transfer editing activity against Cys-tRNA in vitro and in vivo (29An S. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol.

In contrast, Clostridium sticklandii PrdX has been reported to display Ala-tRNAPro deacylation specificity (37Ahel I. Korencic D. Ibba M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 15422-15427Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The chemical basis for the altered substrate specificity within the YbaK superfamily is not understood. To begin to address this question, a multiple-sequence alignment of YbaK superfamily members with known function, including YbaK, the INS domain of ProRS, and PrdX, was performed using the ClustalW multiple-sequence realignment program (Fig. 1). A separate alignment of the 105-member YbaK subfamily was also carried out (supplemental Fig. 1). As noted previously (35Zhang H. Huang K. Li Z. Banerjei L. Fisher K.E. Grishin N.V. Eisenstein E.

In addition, several other highly conserved residues in the YbaK subfamily include surface-exposed lysines and glycines in the flexible random coil regions of YbaK.

This unique carbohydrate, consisting of a sulfated trisaccharide (HSO(3)-3GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc-), is biosynthesized by the successive actions of β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (β4GalT), glucuronyltransferase (GlcAT-P and GlcAT-S), and sulfotransferase (HNK-1ST). A previous study showed that mice lacking β4GalT-II, one of seven β4GalTs, exhibited a dramatic loss of HNK-1 expression in the brain, although β4GalT-I-deficient mice did not. Here, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanism of the regulation of HNK-1 expression. First, focusing on a major HNK-1 carrier, neural cell adhesion molecule, we found that reduced expression of an N-linked HNK-1 carbohydrate caused by a deficiency of β4GalT-II is not likely due to a general loss of the β1,4-galactose residue as an acceptor for GlcAT-P. Instead, we demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and endoplasmic reticulum-retention analyses using Neuro2a (N2a) cells that β4GalT-II physically and specifically associates with GlcAT-P. In addition, we revealed by pulldown assay that Golgi luminal domains of β4GalT-II and GlcAT-P are sufficient for the complex to form. With an in vitro assay system, we produced the evidence that the kinetic efficiency k(cat)/K(m) of GlcAT-P in the presence of β4GalT-II was increased about 2.5-fold compared with that in the absence of β4GalT-II. Finally, we showed that co-expression of β4GalT-II and GlcAT-P increased HNK-1 expression on various glycoproteins in N2a cells, including neural cell adhesion molecule. These results indicate that the specific enzyme complex of β4GalT-II with GlcAT-P plays an important role in the biosynthesis of HNK-1 carbohydrate."

The physiological relationship between the two proteins was also established in global gene expression and transcriptional reporter studies in pregnant smtnl1−/− mice and by RNA interference in progesterone-sensitive cell lines. We show that the contraction-associated and progestin-sensitive genes (oxytocin receptor, connexin 43, and cyclooxygenase-2) and prolactins are down-regulated in pregnant smtnl1−/− mice.

Sequence alignments with other NRs and secondary structure predictions suggest that the FTZ-F1 LBD, like that of other NR proteins, is composed of 12 helices. Recent reports have also shown that transcriptional regulation by ligand-dependent NRs is achieved by interactions with cognate lipophilic ligands, which convert apo-NRs into the holo-conformation (8Beato M.

These studies suggest that ligand binding to NR LBDs induces a conformational change in the LBD such that the AF-2 helix, which is the last α-helix at the C terminus, reorients its position to facilitate the binding of cofactors. However, FTZ-F1 has been considered an orphan NR because no cognate ligand has yet been identified. Therefore, the molecular mechanism governing FTZ-F1 activation and regulation has remained largely unknown. Among the vertebrate NRs, those most similar to FTZ-F1 are steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1/NR5A1) and liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1/NR5A2), which share ∼40% sequence identity with FTZ-F1 in the LBD. Recently, the structure of the mouse LRH-1 LBD has been solved, revealing that the AF-2 helix forms an active conformation despite the presence of a large and empty ligand-binding pocket (LBP) (19Sablin E.P. Krylova I.N. Fletterick R.J. Ingraham H.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1575-1585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Unlike mouse LRH-1, human LRH-1 requires the putative ligand phosphatidylinositol for optimum activity (20Krylova I.N. Sablin E.P. Moore J. Xu R.X. Waitt G.M. MacKay J.A. Juzumiene D. Bynum J.M. Madauss K. Montana V. Lebedeva L. Suzawa M. Williams J.D. Williams S.P. Guy R.K. Thornton J.W. Fletterick R.J. Willson T.M. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 2005; 120: 343-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Because FTZ-F1 constitutively interacts with its co-activator FTZ, we presume that its regulation mechanism in the absence of exogenous ligand might be similar to that of mouse LRH-1. Although FTZ contains a highly conserved homeodomain that is required for DNA binding (21Desplan C. Theis J. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1988; 54: 1081-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), FTZ is capable of performing some of its functions in the absence of its homeodomain through its interaction with FTZ-F1, showing that FTZ and FTZ-F1 cooperate to regulate target gene expression (22Schwartz C.J. Sampson H.M. Hlousek D. Percival-Smith A. Copeland J.W. Simmonds A.J. Krause H.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). FTZ, like most NR co-activators, interacts with FTZ-F1 through a conserved LXXLL motif (NR box). The LXXLL motif of the co-activator interacts with the NR LBD via LBD helices H3, H4, and H12 (AF-2). The AF-2 helix, which has a tendency to switch its position in a ligand-dependent manner, forms a crucial part of the interaction surface (23Feng W. Ribeiro R.C. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.W.

Biol. 1999; 19: 3895-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Previous reports have shown that FTZ-F1 contains a highly conserved AF-2 helix that is required for FTZ binding both in vitro and in vivo (22Schwartz C.J. Sampson H.M. Hlousek D. Percival-Smith A. Copeland J.W. Simmonds A.J. Krause H.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To gain functional insight into FTZ-F1·FTZ, we performed structural and biochemical studies on the FTZ-F1·FTZ complex. Here, we present the first atomic resolution structure of the FTZ-F1·FTZ complex derived from x-ray crystallography. Our structure demonstrates the detailed binding mode of the FTZ co-activator and surprisingly reveals that the LBP of the FTZ-F1 LBD is completely occupied by the hydrophobic residues of helix 6 (H6). In combination with results from mutagenesis experiments, our data suggest that helix 6 acts as a pseudoligand and plays a critical role in FTZ-F1 function. FTZ residues 88–119 and 88–136 were generated by PCR, and resulting PCR fragments were subcloned into pGEX4T-1 (GE Healthcare) to generate expression plasmids pGEX-4T-1-FTZ (residues 88–119) and pGEX-4T-1-FTZ (residues 88–136). Plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3), grown in LB medium, and induced for 3 h with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted and lysed in Laemmli buffer. Plasmids used to express FTZ and FTZ(1–170) (pFNS) were described previously (22Schwartz C.J. Sampson H.M. Hlousek D. Percival-Smith A. Copeland J.W. Simmonds A.J. Krause H.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The N-terminal start site of the LBD was delineated by aligning sequences of FTZ-F1 homologues with Drosophila melaganoster, Bombyx mori, and Tribolium castaneum FTZ-F1 proteins, as well as with mLRH-1, mSF-1, and the closest known Drosophila NR to FTZ-F1, DHR39, using the Clustal X program. The secondary structures of these proteins were predicted by the PHD program. Based on these results, the LBD expression sequence was cloned into the pET15(b) vector (Novagen). The plasmid encoding the His-tagged Drosophila FTZ-F1 LBD (22Schwartz C.J. Sampson H.M. Hlousek D. Percival-Smith A. Copeland J.W. Simmonds A.J. Krause H.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3), which were then induced with 0.25 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and then grown at 25 °C for 6 h. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0) and then disrupted by sonication. The soluble supernatant was collected by ultracentrifugation (140,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), and His-tagged FTZ-F1 LBD protein was purified on a cobalt TALON column (BD Biosciences). After removal of the His tag using bovine thrombin (Amersham Biosciences), the FTZ-F1 LBD protein was further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the following buffer: 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 6.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol. To express SeMet-substituted FTZ-F1 LBD, FTZ-F1 LBD plasmid was transformed into E. coli B834(DE3) cells, and the protein was expressed in minimal media. A 19-residue FTZ peptide (FTZPEP) was synthesized (Anygen Co.), and the synthesized product was shown by NMR spectroscopy to be >98% pure. Crystals of the FTZ-F1 LBD·FTZPEP complex were obtained at 17 °C from a 15 mg/ml solution using the microbatch method with an equal volume of reservoir buffer (1.3 m tri-basic sodium citrate, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5). A crystal appeared after 1 day and then grew continuously to 0.6 × 0.1 × 0.05 mm in 3–5 days. The FTZ-F1 LBD·FTZPEP complex crystal contained one complex per asymmetry unit; the space group was P3(1)21. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (6B1 beamline) at three wavelengths for multiwavelength anomalous dispersion at 100 K using mother liquor supplemented with 10% glycerol for cryoprotection. All diffraction data were processed and scaled using the HKL 2000 program package (25Otwinowski Z. Minor O. Methods in Enzymology. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38526) Google Scholar).

The binding assay was performed with a constant flow rate of 10 μl/min at 25 °C with FTZPEP concentrations in the range of 15–200 μm. Surface plasmon resonance buffers and solutions were as follows: eluent buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4); μ-dispensor buffer/HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween-20, pH 7.4); and regeneration solution (10 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.35 mm EDTA, pH 8.3). Titration calorimetry experiments were performed using a VP-ITC titration calorimetric system (Microcal, Inc.). The solution in the calorimetric cell consisted of 0.04 mm FTZ-F1 LBD in 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) and was titrated at 25 °C with 0.3 mm FTZPEP, dissolved in the same buffer, in a 250-μl injection syringe. The raw calorimetry data were collected and analyzed by Origin data analysis software (version 7.0; Microcal, Inc.). The binding isotherms were fitted to a one-site binding model, yielding values for the stoichiometry (N) of the interaction, the enthalpy of binding (ΔH), and the dissociation constant (Kd). The pAc5.1-G4DBD vector, which contains the gene encoding the Gal4 DNA-binding domain followed by a multiple cloning site, was obtained from Prof. J. Choe (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology). The wild-type FTZ-F1 LBD was cloned into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of this vector to create a Gal4 DBD-FTZ-F1 LBD fusion construct. FTZ-F1(Gly-6), with the 12 residues from Leu-901 to Leu-912 replaced by six glycine residues, was synthesized (Genscript Co.) and subcloned into EcoRI/XbaI sites of the same vector. Five mutant constructs, each replacing the five leucine residues in the H6 individually with alanine (L901A, L902A, L904A, L906A, and L912A), were also subcloned into the same EcoRI/XbaI sites of the vector. Drosophila S2 cells were cultured and transfected with DNA using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described by the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). A total of 5 μg of each DNA construct was used to transfect a 3-ml culture of S2 cells. An equal amount of the appropriate empty vector was transfected for a negative control in each case. Luciferase assays were performed using a kit as suggested by the kit manufacturer (Promega) using a luminometer (Turner Designs). Values were normalized for transfection efficiency by measuring the β-galactosidase activity from a co-transfected pActin-LacZ (Promega). Anti-G4DBD (sc-577) and anti-β-tubulin (sc-20852) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. To delineate the N-terminal start site of the FTZ-F1 LBD, we made secondary structure predictions based on sequence alignments of FTZ-F1 homologues. Leu-791 was chosen as the start site of the FTZ-F1 LBD based on the following results: 1) among the insect FTZ-F1 homologues used in the alignment, the residue immediately N-terminal to Leu-791 is not conserved; 2) the α-helical secondary structure is predicted to begin a few residues C-terminal to Leu-791; and 3) as shown by Krause and colleagues (22Schwartz C.J. Sampson H.M. Hlousek D. Percival-Smith A. Copeland J.W. Simmonds A.J. Krause H.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), this construct (Leu-791–Gly-1027) is soluble and sufficient for a interaction with FTZ in vitro. Minimal FTZ fragments sufficient for binding to FTZ-F1 were determined using a similar approach. Alignments of FTZ sequences from D. melanogaster, Drosophila hydei, and T. castaneum were submitted for secondary structure prediction (supplemental Fig. S1A). Based on these alignments, GST-FTZ fusion proteins of decreasing size spanning residues 88–119 were generated (supplemental Fig. S1B). FTZ fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and used in far Western experiments with a radiolabeled FTZ-F1 LBD probe. All FTZ fragments tested bound to the FTZ-F1 LBD (supplemental Fig. S1C, lanes 2–5), whereas GST alone did not (supplemental Fig. S1C, lane 1). The amount of protein loaded is shown in the Coomassie-stained gel (supplemental Fig. S1C, lanes 6–10). Surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were used to determine the binding affinity of the LXXLL motif, corresponding to residues Val-102–Leu-120 of FTZPEP, for the FTZ-F1 LBD. Binding to the FTZ-F1 LBD was observed upon injection of different concentrations of FTZPEP, from which a dissociation constant of 0.99 × 10−6 m was calculated (supplemental Fig. S2A). Isothermal titration calorimetry was also used to confirm FTZPEP binding to the FTZ-F1 LBD (supplemental Fig. S2B). Analysis of the data showed a 1:1 binding stoichiometry with a Kd value of 1.52 × 10−6 m and an apparent ΔH of −7.568 kcal/mol. The crystal structure of the FTZ-F1 LBD·FTZPEP complex was solved using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion, and refined at 2.8 Å resolution. Parameters and properties of crystallographic refinements are summarized in Table 1. The overall structure of the FTZ-F1 LBD resembles the canonical fold of other reported NR LBDs in the NR5A family, with four α-helical sandwich layers containing 12 α-helices (Fig. 1). A well defined AF-2 helix (H12), which participates in LXXLL cofactor binding together with H3 and H4, is clearly observed (22Schwartz C.J. Sampson H.M. Hlousek D. Percival-Smith A. Copeland J.W. Simmonds A.J. Krause H.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Residues from Ser-108 to Asn-115 in the FTZPEP are observed within the co-activator binding cleft site (Fig. 1). This form is similar to that of other cofactor-bound NRs, suggesting that the FTZ-F1 LBD adopts an active conformation in the presence of cofactor FTZPEP. FTZ-F1 LBD, like other NR5A family members, has an H2 helix that constitutes the fourth helical sandwich layer. It is known that the H2 helix in NR5A family NRs stabilizes the H3 and AF-2 helices for NR activation (19Sablin E.P. Krylova I.N. Fletterick R.J. Ingraham H.A. Mol.

Cell. 2005; 17: 491-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The structure of FTZ-F1·FTZPEP confirms that all NR5A members have this distinctive and unique H2 α-helix. The most distinctive feature of the FTZ-F1 LBD is an LBP. Surprisingly, the LBP of the FTZ-F1 LBD is occupied by helix 6 (Fig. 1). FTZPEP bound in the co-activator cleft is well stabilized by both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with residues in H3, H4, and AF-2 of the FTZ-F1 LBD. An extensive hydrogen-bonding network, referred to as a charge clamp, is observed (Fig. 2A). As with the SF-1 and LRH-1 LBDs, the FTZ-F1 LBD contains well conserved canonical residues required for co-activator binding (19Sablin E.P. Krylova I.N. Fletterick R.J. Ingraham H.A. Mol.

Like the LRH-1·SF-1 LBD in complex with SHP and NcoA-2 cofactor peptides, FTZPEP also forms an amphipathic α-helix upon binding to the FTZ-F1 LBD. Residues Arg-849, Asp-860, and Glu-1019 of the FTZ-F1 LBD form hydrogen bonds with Leu-109, Arg-110, and Leu-112 of FTZPEP, respectively. Glu-1019 of H12 serves to stabilize FTZ, mainly via a hydrogen bond (Fig. 2A). The unique feature is an additional ionic interaction between Arg-110 of FTZ and Asp-860 in H4 of the FTZ-F1 LBD. This interaction is variable in both SF-1 and LRH-1 due to an amino acid substitution (Fig. 2B). The other stabilizing force comes from hydrophobic interactions between the cluster of side chains of Phe-842, Val-845, Val-859, Met-863, Leu-866, Leu-1016, and Met-1020 of the FTZ-F1 LBD, and hydrophobic residues of FTZPEP. Specifically, Leu-109 of FTZ interacts with residues Met-863 and Met-1020 of the FTZ-F1 LBD, whereas residues Leu-112 and Leu-113 of FTZ are embedded within the hydrophobic grooves formed by residues Val-859, Val-845, and Phe-842 in the FTZ-F1 LBD (Fig. 2A). Most of the NR LBD structures characterized to date, including those of SF-1 and LRH-1, exhibit a well defined LBP. In the relatively few NR LBDs that do not contain such a pocket (e.g. the NR4A orphan receptors Nurr1 and DHR38), the ligand pocket is occupied by bulky and hydrophobic side chains of residues in surrounding α-helices (36Baker K.D. Shewchuk L.M. Kozlova T. Makishima M. Hassell A. Wisely B. Caravella J.A. Lambert M.H. Reinking J.L. Krause H. Thummel C.S. Willson T.M. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Nature. 2003; 423: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The FTZ-F1 LBD structure, however, reveals an unusual LBP in which a single helix H6, comprising residues Leu-901–Leu-912, occupies the LBP, blocking the ligand from entering and occupying it (Fig. 3, A and B). Interactions between H6 and residues within the LBP are mainly stabilized by hydrophobic forces. These residues include Leu-901, Met-902, Leu-904, and Val-906 in the H6 and H9 helices, which form a hydrophobic patch (Fig. 3B). The N terminus of the loop is linked to short anti-parallel β-strands, which strongly interact at their turns with the loop between H2 and H3 through the following hydrogen bonds: Gln-897 NE2–Val-825 carbonyl oxygen, Asn-895 ND2–Val-825 carbonyl oxygen, Asn-895 ND2–Thr-821 carbonyl oxygen, and Asn-895 OD1–Thr-821 carbonyl oxygen. These hydrogen bonds play an important role in stabilizing the turn structure of the short anti-parallel β-strands. The structure of H6 is well supported through an extensive network of hydrogen bonds that includes bonding between the side chain of Ser-903 of H6 and Asn-900 of β2 (Fig. 3B). The role of H6 in the function of FTZ-F1 was confirmed by assaying transcriptional activity for FTZ-F1 in Drosophila S2 cells (Fig. 3C). Mutations in H6 residues decreased the transcriptional activity of FTZ-F1, and there was a correlation between the reduction in FTZ-F1 activity and position of the mutated residues (Fig. 3C). The results show that residues critical for transcriptional activity are located within the hydrophobic cluster in H6. The most profound effects were observed for the FTZ-F1 LBDL904D and FTZ-F1 LBDL906D mutants, which exhibited approximately a 90% decrease in transcriptional activity, suggesting that the hydrophobic patch formed by Leu-904 and Leu-906 in the LBP is essential for transcriptional activity. Consistent with this, the FTZ-F1 LBDL901D/L904D/L906D triple mutant lost virtually all transcriptional activity, as did the corresponding FTZ-F1(Gly-6) LBD mutant (Fig. 3C). Western blot analyses using an anti-G4DBD antibody showed that mutations in H6 of the FTZ-F1 LBD did not significantly affect protein expression, and CD spectra of mutants show similar folds to those observed in wild type (supplemental Fig. S3), indicating that the observed decrease in transcriptional activity is not due to structural changes in the mutant proteins. Taken together, these findings suggest that interactions between H6 and the residues of the LBP of FTZ-F1 are directly responsible for FTZ-F1 function. We performed structural superposition and sequence alignment of the FTZ-F1 LBD with the LRH-1 and SF-1 LBDs (supplemental Fig. S4 and Fig. 4A). The structure of the FTZ-F1 LBD shows two dramatic structural differences from other NRs: the position of the β-sheet and the orientation of the H6 helix (Fig. 4B). The anti-parallel β-sheet of the FTZ-F1 LBD is nearly parallel to H2 and H3, whereas those of the LRH-1 and SF-1 LBDs are oriented perpendicular to H2 and H3. This is due to the unique position of the H2 helix in the FTZ-F1 LBD, which is located in the LBP (Fig. 4B). As a result, the anti-parallel β-sheet is sterically hindered by the H2 helix, resulting in a rotation of the β-strands by 90° compared with those of the SF-1 and LRH-1 LBDs. Residues in the loop between the β-strands interact with residues in the loop between H2 and H3; forming hydrogen bonds between side chains of Asn-895 and Asn-897 with backbone atoms of the residues in the loop between H2 and H3. We propose that the amino acid sequence differences between the FTZ-F1 LBD and those of other NRs cause the conformational change of the β-sheet in FTZ-F1 (supplemental Fig. S4). Because H6 is linked to the β-sheet, this structural change in the β-sheet directly affects the H6 position. Crystal structures of human SF-1 and LRH-1 LBDs show that the LBP of these NRs are occupied by free phospholipids (20Krylova I.N. Sablin E.P. Moore J. Xu R.X. Waitt G.M. MacKay J.A. Juzumiene D.

Interestingly, the H6 helix of the FTZ-F1 LBD is found in the position occupied by the phospholipid in the structure of the LRH-1 complex, suggesting that H6 could serve as a ligand substitute in place of a natural ligand or act as a molecular placeholder in the absence of a natural ligand (Fig. 5A). The hydrophobic leucine residues in H6 of FTZ-F1 LBD interact with hydrophobic residues in the LBP (Fig. 5A). The 2Fo − Fc omit map of H6 at 1.2σ shows the quality of the final electron density in the LBP (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the relative orientation of H6 is quite different from that of the LRH-1 and SF-1 LBDs as shown in Fig. 5C. Although H6 interacts with most of the pocket-forming residues, it leaves some portion of the LBP unfilled (Fig. 5, A and C). Using the CASTp server (38Dundas J. Ouyang Z. Tseng J. Binkowski A. Turpaz Y. Liang J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W116-W118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar), we calculated volumes of the LBP of the SF-1 and LRH-1 LBDs. They are 1749.7 Å3 and 2322.7 Å3, respectively, large enough to accommodate phospholipids. However, that of the FTZ-F1 LBD is calculated as a 764.1 Å3, which is a relatively small space to accommodate phospholipid molecules. Helix H6 is oriented away from LBP in the LRH-1 and SF-1 LBDs (Fig. 5C). In contrast, H6 of the FTZ-F1 LBD is located in the LBP (Fig. 5A). The conformational uniqueness of the FTZ-F1 LBD can be compared with that of the T. castaneum USP (TcUSP) LBD (Fig. 6A) (39Iwema T. Billas I.M. Beck Y. Bonneton F. Nierengarten H. Chaumot A. Richards G. Laudet V. Moras D. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3770-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Here, the loop blocks the LBP and functions like H6 of FTZ-F1 (Fig. 6B). However, the FTZ-F1 LBD has 12 α-helices and two β-strands with a canonical nuclear receptor topology unlike TcUSP. Another interesting fact is the position of the AF-2. The position of the AF-2 of the TcUSP LBD is different from that of the AF-2 in FTZ-F1 (Fig. 6, A and B). The primary sequences of NR LBDs are relatively well conserved despite their different biological functions. The structures of the FTZ-F1 and hLRH-1 LBDs, like their primary sequences, superimpose very well, with an root mean square deviation value of 0.72 Å (Cα) for residues Leu-791–Arg-1025 of the FTZ-F1 LBD. The close alignment includes the AF-2 helix, which is in the proper orientation for cofactor binding. In both structures, an extended H2 helix stabilizes H3 in the absence of a ligand molecule, which in turn places the AF-2 helix in the active position (19Sablin E.P. Krylova I.N. Fletterick R.J. Ingraham H.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1575-1585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This orientation in the stabilized, active conformation appears to be a trait specific to the NR5A family. The structure of the FTZ-F1 LBD shows that H6 prevents binding of a ligand molecule in the LBP. These results suggest that the LBD of FTZ-F1 can adopt a fully active form in the absence of a ligand molecule by orienting its AF-2 helix. The identification of cognate ligands has proven crucial in elucidating NR functions and enabling therapeutic drug development (40Chiang J.Y. Curr. Opin Investig. Drugs. 2005; 6: 994-1001PubMed Google Scholar, 41Pearce K.H. Iannone M.A. Simmons C.A. Gray J.G. Drug Discov. Today. 2004; 9: 741-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 42Kallenberger B.C.

However, the recent structural characterization of LBD structures of several orphan NRs, showing LBPs filled with NR side chains (19Sablin E.P. Krylova I.N. Fletterick R.J. Ingraham H.A. Mol.

The discovery of phospholipid bound forms of the LRH-1 and SF-1 LBDs has suggested that these NRs, at least, may not be orphans and that they might have a ligand-dependent mode of action. On the other hand, mouse SF-1, in which a 2.7 Å salt bridge between Arg-314 (H5) and Glu-238 (H2) is disrupted with no effect on ligand binding, shows sharply diminished receptor activity (20Krylova I.N. Sablin E.P. Moore J. Xu R.X. Waitt G.M. MacKay J.A. Juzumiene D. Bynum J.M. Madauss K. Montana V. Lebedeva L. Suzawa M. Williams J.D. Williams S.P. Guy R.K. Thornton J.W. Fletterick R.J. Willson T.M.

Our structural and functional analyses of the FTZ-F1 LBD are consistent with this hypothesis. The novel use of an intramolecular helix to fill the LBP (Fig. 5C) together with additional structural modifications, such as the elongated H2, might indicate that the FTZ-F1 can form an active structure with FTZ co-activator in the absence of a ligand molecule, supporting the inclusion of FTZ-F1 in a new class of ligand-independent nuclear receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2057850318,"A zinc finger protein, ZPR9, has been identified as a physiological substrate of murine protein serine/threonine kinase 38 (MPK38), which is involved in various cellular responses, including the cell cycle, apoptosis, embryonic development, and oncogenesis. Here, ZPR9 was found to physically interact with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) through a disulfide linkage involving Cys1351 and Cys1360 of ASK1 and Cys305 and Cys308 of ZPR9. ASK1 directly phosphorylated ZPR9 at Ser314 and Thr318, suggesting that ZPR9 can act as an ASK1 substrate. Ectopic expression of wild-type ZPR9, but not an S314A/T318A mutant, stimulated ASK1 kinase activity and positively regulated ASK1-mediated signaling to both JNK and p38 kinases by destabilizing complex formation between ASK1 and its negative regulators, Trx and 14-3-3, or by increasing complex formation between ASK1 and its substrate MKK3. ZPR9 functionally stimulated ASK1-induced AP-1 transcriptional activity as well as H2O2-mediated apoptosis in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. ASK1-mediated phosphorylation of ZPR9 at Ser314 and Thr318 was also responsible for ZPR9-induced apoptosis. Moreover, ZPR9 inhibited PDK1-mediated signaling through ASK1 activation.

Ectopic expression of wild-type ZPR9, but not an S314A/T318A mutant, stimulated ASK1 kinase activity and positively regulated ASK1-mediated signaling to both JNK and p38 kinases by destabilizing complex formation between ASK1 and its negative regulators, Trx and 14-3-3, or by increasing complex formation between ASK1 and its substrate MKK3. ZPR9 functionally stimulated ASK1-induced AP-1 transcriptional activity as well as H2O2-mediated apoptosis in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. ASK1-mediated phosphorylation of ZPR9 at Ser314 and Thr318 was also responsible for ZPR9-induced apoptosis. Moreover, ZPR9 inhibited PDK1-mediated signaling through ASK1 activation. These results suggest that ZPR9 functions as a novel positive regulator of ASK1.

Many proteins, including thioredoxin (Trx), glutaredoxin, GSTμ, heat shock protein 72, 14-3-3, Akt, p21Cip1, protein serine/threonine phosphatase 5, and serine-threonine kinase receptor-associated protein (STRAP), were found to play an inhibitory role in ASK1 activity through physical interaction. Meanwhile, other ASK1-interacting proteins, including tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor, Daxx, JNK/stress-activated protein kinase-associated protein 1/JNK-interacting protein 3, calcineurin, and murine protein serine/threonine kinase 38 (MPK38), function as positive regulators of ASK1 function.

Zinc finger protein ZPR9 was originally identified as a physiological substrate of MPK38, also named maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (Melk). MPK38 is responsible for various cellular functions, including early T cell activation, embryonic development, apoptosis, and oncogenesis (19Seong H.A. Gil M. Kim K.T. Kim S.J. Ha H. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 597-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gil M. Yang Y. Lee Y. Choi I. Ha H. Gene. 1997; 195: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Heyer B.S. Warsowe J. Solter D. Knowles B.B. Ackerman S.L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 47: 148-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ZPR9 is a zinc finger protein containing three zinc finger motifs. It is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, but its interacting partner MPK38 redirects the subcellular localization of ZPR9 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus through direct interaction (19Seong H.A. Gil M. Kim K.T. Kim S.J. Ha H. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 597-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ZPR9 also interacts with B-myb and stimulates B-myb transcriptional activity (22Seong H.A. Kim K.T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9655-9662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). ZPR9 has been shown to enhance retinoic acid- or TNF-α-induced apoptosis, suggesting ZPR9 as a potential pro-apoptotic protein (22Seong H.A. Kim K.T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9655-9662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying the pro-apoptotic properties of ZPR9 are unknown at present. In this study we found that ZPR9 plays an important role in the regulation of the ASK1-mediated signaling pathway, in which it acts as a positive regulator of ASK1 by modulating complex formation between ASK1 and its negative regulators, Trx and 14-3-3, or its substrate MKK3. We also provide evidence that ASK1-mediated ZPR9 phosphorylation at Ser314 and Thr318 is critical for stimulating ASK1 activity, leading to the enhancement of JNK-mediated transactivation and H2O2-induced apoptosis.

Inducible ZPR9 shRNA stable clones were screened in the presence of 450 μg/ml G418 for ∼14 days. To confirm the knockdown of endogenous ZPR9, stable clones were isolated, treated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 72 h (18Jung H. Seong H.A. Manoharan R. Ha H. J. Biol.

In brief, wild-type ZPR9 was used as the template for amplification with either the ZPR9 forward (5′-GCGAATTCATGGCGACGTACACCTGCATA-3′) or reverse (5′-GCCTCGAGTCAGAATCTCACTTGGACCCG-3′) primer, in conjunction with one of the following mutant primers containing alterations in the nucleotide sequence of ZPR9: for C221S, forward (5′-GATGAAGAATTGGAATCTGAGGATACTGAAGCA-3′) and reverse (5′-TGCTTCAGTATCCTCAGATTCCAATTCTTCAT-3′; for C254S, forward (5′-ATCCCTATCACGGACTCCTTATTTTGTTCCCAT-3′) and reverse (5′-ATGGGAACAAAATAAGGAGTCCGTGATAGGGAT-3′); for C257S, forward (5′-ACGGACTGCTTATTTTCTTCCCATCATTCCAGC-3′) and reverse (5′-GCTGGAATGATGGGAAGAAAATAAGCAGTCCGT-3′); for C305S, forward (5′-GGTGTTGGCAAGATTTCCTTGTGGTGCAACGAG-3′) and reverse (5′-CTCGTTGCACCACAAGGAAATCTTGCCAACACC-3′); for C308S, forward (5′-AAGATTTGCTTGTGGTCCAACGAGAAAGGGAAG-3′) and reverse (5′-CTTCCCTTTCTCGTTGGACCACAAGCAAATCTT-3′); for C331S, forward (5′-AATGACAAAAGCCACTCTAAGCTCCTCACAGAT-3′) and reverse (5′-ATCTGTGAAGAGCTTAGAGTGGCTTTTGTCATT-3′); for S314A, forward (5′-GAGAAAGGGAAGGCCTTCTACTCC-3′) and reverse (5′-GGAGTAGAAGGCCTTCCCTTTCTC-3′); for T318A, forward (5′-CTTCTACTCCGCAGAAGCTGTACA-3′) and reverse (5′-TGTACAGCTTCTGCGGAGTAGAAG-3′).

The amplified PCR mixtures were subjected to a second round of PCR amplification in the absence of primers using the following parameters: 5 min at 94 °C for 1 cycle; 30 s at 94 °C, 2 min at 50 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C for 7 cycles. A third round of PCR amplification was then performed using ZPR9 forward and reverse primers and the following parameters: 5 min at 94 °C for 1 cycle; 30 s at 95 °C, 2 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C for 18 cycles. To generate the C305S/C308S double mutant, pGEX4T-1-C305S or pEBG-C305S was used as the template, and the C308S forward and reverse primers were used for PCR amplification.

Luciferase activity was measured by a luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Apoptosis analysis was performed in HEK293 cells transfected with the indicated expression vectors using green fluorescent protein (GFP) and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining for visualization as described previously (10Jung H. Seong H.A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34541-34553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was carried out using Student's t test; p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Values represent the means ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments. MPK38 has been shown to stimulate signaling downstream of ASK1 through direct interaction and phosphorylation (10Jung H. Seong H.A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34541-34553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, a previous study identified ZPR9 as a direct substrate of MPK38 (19Seong H.A. Gil M. Kim K.T. Kim S.J. Ha H. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 597-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the findings from these studies, we hypothesized that ZPR9 might affect the function of ASK1. To determine whether ZPR9 physically interacts with ASK1 in cells, cotransfection experiments were performed using GST-ZPR9 and FLAG-ASK1. ASK1 was only detected in the GST precipitate when coexpressed with GST-ZPR9 and not with control GST alone (Fig. 1A, left). The endogenous interaction between ASK1 and ZPR9 was also detected in NIH 3T3, HEK293, and HaCaT cells through coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 1A, right), supporting the functional association between these two proteins in vivo. Further non-denaturing PAGE experiments were conducted to demonstrate the direct interaction between ASK1 and ZPR9. A shift in the mobility of autophosphorylated ASK1 was detectable in the presence of recombinant ZPR9 but not in the presence of recombinant GST alone (Fig. 1B). This result indicates that ASK1 and ZPR9 interact directly with each other in vitro. Using coimmunoprecipitation experiments, it was then assessed whether ASK1 signals can affect ASK1-ZPR9 complex formation in cells. Exposure of HEK293 cells to ASK1 stimuli, including H2O2, TNF-α, thapsigargin (for endoplasmic reticulum stress), and ionomycin (for calcium overload) resulted in a remarkable increase in the endogenous interaction between ASK1 and ZPR9 compared with the untreated control (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that ZPR9 is functionally linked with ASK1 signaling. To identify the interaction domain of ASK1 involved in ZPR9 binding, in vivo binding assays were performed using three ASK1 deletion mutants (ASK1-N, comprising the amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1–648); ASK1-K, harboring the kinase domain (amino acids 649–940); ASK1-C, comprising the carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain (amino acids 941–1375) as described previously (10Jung H. Seong H.A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34541-34553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). ASK1-C was found to be responsible for ZPR9 binding, whereas ASK1-N and ASK1-K were unable to bind with ZPR9 (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal domain of ASK1 is required for ZPR9 binding. The previous observation (18Jung H. Seong H.A. Manoharan R. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 54-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that complex formation between ASK1 and its negative regulator STRAP requires cysteine residues present in each of the two proteins prompted us to investigate whether cysteine residues of ASK1 and ZPR9 participate in ASK1-ZPR9 complex formation. To this end, four cysteine-to-serine amino acid substitution mutants of ASK1-C (C1005S, C1351S, C1360S, and C1351S/C1360S) were used for in vivo binding assays to identify the potential cysteine residues of ASK1 that are responsible for ZPR9 binding. ZPR9 strongly interacted with ASK1-C and its mutant C1005S but weakly with two other mutants of ASK1-C, C1351S and C1360S. Moreover, this interaction was not detectable in the presence of the C1351S/C1360S double mutant (Fig. 2B, left). These results suggest that the Cys1351 and Cys1360 residues of ASK1 are involved in ZPR9 binding. Next, to search the potential cysteine residues of ZPR9 required for ASK1 binding, in vivo binding assays were also performed using HEK293 cells transfected with seven cysteine-to-serine amino acid substitution mutants of ZPR9 (C221S, C254S, C257S, C305S, C308S, C331S, and C305S/C308S). ASK1 interacted strongly with four ZPR9 mutants (C221S, C254S, C257S, and C331S) and weakly with two additional ZPR9 mutants (C305S and C308S). However, no ASK1 was detected when the C305S/C308S double mutant was coexpressed (Fig. 2B, right), indicating the involvement of Cys305 and Cys308 of ZPR9 in ASK1 binding. A non-denaturing PAGE analysis was then performed to confirm that the Cys1351 and Cys1360 residues of ASK1 and Cys305 and Cys308 residues of ZPR9 play key roles in complex formation. A shift in the mobility of autophosphorylated ASK1 was not detectable in the presence of the C305S/C308S ZPR9 double mutant (Fig. 2C, left). In addition, the C1351S/C1360S double mutant of ASK1-C had no effect on the mobility of 35S-labeled ZPR9 (Fig. 2C, right). These data led us to examine the importance of redox status in the interaction between ASK1 and ZPR9. The presence of the reductants dithiothreitol (DTT) and β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) decreased complex formation between ASK1 and ZPR9 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the oxidant H2O2 had no effect (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that the redox-dependent interaction of ASK1 with ZPR9 occurs in cells. Together, these data clearly indicate that ASK1-ZPR9 complex formation is mediated by cysteine residues present in each of these two proteins, Cys1351 and Cys1360 of ASK1 and Cys305 and Cys308 of ZPR9. Given that ASK1 physically interacts with ZPR9 (see Fig. 1), it is possible that ASK1 phosphorylates ZPR9 through direct interaction. To assess the extent of ASK1-mediated ZPR9 phosphorylation, immunoprecipitated wild-type and kinase-dead ASK1 was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP to allow phosphorylation of the recombinant wild-type and mutant ZPR9 proteins as part of the ASK1 kinase assay. Wild-type ASK1 induced ZPR9 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A, left), suggesting that ZPR9 may be a potential substrate of ASK1. However, ZPR9 phosphorylation was not detected in the presence of kinase dead ASK1. To determine whether ASK1 directly phosphorylates ZPR9, we carried out in vitro kinase assays using recombinant ASK1 and ZPR9 proteins. ZPR9 phosphorylation was clearly detected in the presence of ASK1, whereas the C305S/C308S double mutant, which was unable to bind with ASK1 (see Fig. 2B), was not phosphorylated by ASK1 (Fig. 3A, right). These results indicate that ASK1 is directly phosphorylating ZPR9 through physical interaction. To identify potential ASK1 phosphorylation sites on ZPR9, in vitro kinase assays were performed using three ZPR9 amino acid substitution mutants (S258A/S262A, T272A/S276A, and S314A/T318A) that were screened by searching consensus ASK1 phosphorylation sites ((S/T)XXX(S/T)) in ZPR9. As shown in Fig. 3B, the S314A/T318A double mutant completely abolished ASK1-mediated phosphorylation, whereas ASK1-mediated phosphorylation was detected in the presence of the other double mutants (S258A/S262A and T272A/S276A) as well as the two single mutants (S314A and T318A). These findings suggest that Ser314 and Thr318 of ZPR9 represent potential phosphorylation sites for ASK1. To investigate the effect of ZPR9 on ASK1 activity, ASK1 kinase activity was first examined in HEK293 cells transfected with ASK1 alone or cotransfected with ZPR9 using an in vitro kinase assay. ASK1 kinase activity was markedly increased when ASK1 was coexpressed with wild-type ZPR9 (Fig. 4A, left). Next, to determine whether direct interaction and phosphorylation between ASK1 and ZPR9 are essential for the positive regulation of ASK1 kinase activity, in vitro kinase assays were performed using two ZPR9 double mutants, C305S/C308S and S314A/T318A, which are unable to bind with ASK1 (see Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1) as well as two ZPR9 single mutants, S314A and T318A. The results showed that the two defective mutants (C305S/C308S and S314A/T318A) of ZPR9 in ASK1 binding had no effect on ASK1 kinase activity, whereas the two single mutants, S314A and T318A, were able to increase the ASK1 kinase activity (Fig. 4A, right). This result suggests that ZPR9 functions as a positive regulator of ASK1 through direct interaction and phosphorylation. The direct role of ZPR9 in ASK1 kinase activity was also confirmed using an in vitro experiment with recombinant ASK1 and ZPR9 proteins. As shown in Fig. 4B, recombinant ZPR9 increased ASK1 kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner. However, ASK1 kinase activity was not affected by recombinant ZPR9 in the presence of ASK1-K, which is defective in ZPR9 binding (see Fig. 2A), supporting again the importance of direct interaction between ASK1 and ZPR9 for the regulation of ASK1 activity. Based on these findings, it was next examined whether ZPR9 affects signaling downstream of ASK1. Endogenous ASK1, MKK3, and p38 kinase activities were determined by in vitro kinase assays using parental SK-N-BE(2)C cells and SK-N-BE(2)C cells stably expressing pCMV-ZPR9 (ZPR9(OE)). Overexpression of ZPR9 markedly increased the endogenous kinase activities of ASK1, MKK3, and p38 compared with parental SK-N-BE(2)C cells (Fig. 5A, left). These results were also confirmed in immunoblot analysis using anti-phospho-specific antibodies for ASK1 Thr845 (corresponding to Thr838 in human), MKK3/6, p38, and ATF2. ZPR9 overexpression induced higher phosphorylation levels of ASK1, MKK3/6, p38, and ATF2, which accompany ASK1-mediated signaling (Fig. 5A, right). Consistent with this, knockdown of endogenous ZPR9 showed an opposite trend in the modulation of endogenous ASK1, MKK3, and p38 kinase activities and phosphorylations (Fig. 5B), indicating that ZPR9 functions as a positive regulator of ASK1. It was also determined whether the stimulatory effect of ZPR9 on ASK1-p38/JNK signaling is dependent on ASK1 phosphorylations involved in ASK1 activation (at Thr838) and inactivation (at Ser83 and Ser967) using immunoblot analysis in ZPR9(OE) and ZPR9(KD) cells. Overexpression of ZPR9 considerably decreased ASK1 phosphorylation at Ser83 and Ser967 compared with control parental SK-N-BE(2)C cells. In contrast, ASK1 phosphorylation at Thr838 was increased by ZPR9 (Fig. 5C, left). Consistently, knockdown of endogenous ZPR9 clearly showed an opposite trend in the modulation of Ser83, Thr838, and Ser967 phosphorylation (Fig. 5C, right). These results indicate that ZPR9-mediated stimulation of ASK1 activity apparently embodies the concordant modulation of ASK1 phosphorylation at Ser83, Thr838, and Ser967. Given that Trx and 14-3-3 physically associate with ASK1 and inhibit ASK1 activity (3Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2065) Google Scholar, 14Zhang L. Chen J. Fu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8511-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), in vivo binding assays were performed using HEK293 cells transfected with FLAG-Trx (or FLAG-14-3-3), HA-ASK1, and increasing amounts of ZPR9 to investigate whether ZPR9 affects complex formation between ASK1 and Trx or 14-3-3. Complex formation was markedly decreased in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of ZPR9 (Fig. 6, A and B, left). These results suggest that the modulation of the association between ASK1 and its negative regulators, Trx and 14-3-3, is possibly involved in ZPR9-mediated regulation of ASK1 activity. Consistent with this result, knockdown of endogenous ZPR9 increased complex formation between ASK1 and its negative regulators, Trx and 14-3-3 (Fig. 6, A and B, right). Using the same approach, the effect of ZPR9 on MKK3 binding to ASK1 was also examined, as MKK3 is a direct substrate of ASK1. The results showed that ZPR9 increased ASK1-MKK3 complex formation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6C), resulting in the stimulation of ASK1 activity. A similar trend was also observed at endogenous levels in the analysis of the complex formation between ASK1 and its regulators (Trx, 14-3-3, MKK3, and ZPR9) (Fig. 6D). Together, these data indicate that ZPR9 positively regulates ASK1 activity by decreasing the association between ASK1 and its negative regulators, Trx and 14-3-3, and increasing complex formation between ASK1 and its substrate MKK3. Because ZPR9 stimulates ASK1 activity through physical interaction (see FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5), it is possible that ZPR9 can potentiate ASK1-induced AP-1 transcriptional activity. To examine this, reporter assays were performed using an AP-1 luciferase reporter gene. ZPR9 increased ASK1-induced AP-1 transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the S314A/T318A mutant of ZPR9, which is defective in ASK1-mediated phosphorylation (see Fig. 3), had no effect (Fig. 7A, top and middle). This suggested that ZPR9 phosphorylation at Ser314 and Thr318 by ASK1 plays an important role in the ZPR9-mediated enhancement of ASK1-induced AP-1 transcriptional activity. Consistently, knockdown of endogenous ZPR9 decreased AP-1 transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7A, bottom). Next, to investigate whether the ZPR9-mediated enhancement of AP-1 transcriptional activity is accompanied by ASK1-mediated JNK activation, in vitro kinase assays were also performed with c-Jun as a substrate to assess JNK activity. ZPR9 increased ASK1-mediated JNK activation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the S314A/T318A mutant had no effect (Fig. 7B, left). This result was confirmed in a ZPR9 knockdown system induced by ZPR9-specific siRNAs. JNK activity was decreased in a dose-dependent manner by ZPR9 knockdown (Fig. 7B, left). A similar trend was also observed in HEK293 cells stably expressing an shRNA targeting ZPR9 (ZPR9(KD)) (Fig. 7B, right). Together, these data suggest a critical role for ASK1-mediated phosphorylation of ZPR9 at Ser314 and Thr318 in the ZPR9-mediated enhancement of ASK1-induced AP-1 transactivation. To investigate whether ZPR9 can regulate cell death induced by an ASK1 stimulator, H2O2, the effect of ZPR9 on H2O2-induced cell death was examined using apoptosis assays as determined by GFP system and TUNEL staining (10Jung H. Seong H.A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34541-34553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Jung H. Seong H.A. Manoharan R. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 54-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) in HEK293 cells. The results showed that wild-type ZPR9 increased H2O2-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8A, top, fourth lane versus fifth and sixth lanes). A dose-dependent increase in H2O2-induced cell death was also detected in the presence of the two ZPR9 single mutants, S314A and T318A (Fig. 8A, middle). However, no difference in H2O2-induced apoptosis was observed with the S314A/T318A double mutant compared with the control, which was treated with H2O2 in the absence of ZPR9 (Fig. 8A, top and middle). These results suggest that ASK1-mediated phosphorylation of ZPR9 at Ser314 and Thr318 is essential for the regulation of H2O2-induced apoptosis. The stimulatory role of ZPR9 in H2O2-induced cell apoptosis was confirmed using a ZRP9 knockdown system. Transfection of ZPR9-specific siRNA resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in H2O2-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 8A, bottom, sixth lane versus thirteenth and fourteenth lanes), suggesting that ZPR9 functions as a positive regulator of ASK1 that is involved in H2O2-induced apoptosis. Next, to investigate the ability of ZPR9 to induce caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage, immunoblot analysis was also performed with anti-caspase-3 and anti-PARP antibodies, respectively, using HEK293 cells transfected with wild-type and mutant forms (S314A/T318A and C305S/C308S) of ZPR9 or ZPR9-specific siRNA as well as ZPR9(KD) cells stably expressing an shRNA targeting ZPR9. The results showed that ZPR9-mediated stimulation of H2O2-induced apoptosis involves in vivo caspase-3 activation, leading to proteolytic cleavage of PARP (Fig. 8, B and C). Given that ASK1 inhibits PDK1 activity through direct interaction and phosphorylation (24Seong H.A. Jung H. Ichijo H. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 2397-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), it was next assessed whether PDK1-mediated signaling suppressed by ASK1 could be regulated by ZPR9 using an inducible ZPR9 knockdown system. As expected, the knockdown of endogenous ZPR9 markedly decreased signaling downstream of ASK1 as determined by immunoblot analysis using anti-phospho-specific antibodies for ASK1 Thr845, MKK3/6, p38, and ATF2 (Fig. 9, left). However, the opposite trend in PDK1-mediated signaling was observed upon knockdown of endogenous ZPR9 (Fig. 9, right). These results clearly indicate that, physiologically, ZPR9 acts as a positive regulator of ASK1 and subsequently leads to the inhibition of PDK1-mediated signaling. In this study it was found that ZPR9, a physiological substrate of MPK38 serine/threonine kinase (19Seong H.A. Gil M. Kim K.T. Kim S.J. Ha H. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 597-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), physically interacted with ASK1 and stimulated ASK1 function. Furthermore, ZPR9 phosphorylation at Ser314 and Thr318 induced by ASK1 was critical for the regulation of ASK1-mediated signaling. The finding that ZPR9 associated with ASK1 prompted us to investigate how ZPR9 regulates ASK1 activity. To this end, it was determined whether the direct interaction and phosphorylation between ASK1 and ZPR9 plays an important role in ZPR9-mediated regulation of ASK1 activity using in vitro kinase assays (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5), luciferase reporter assays (Fig. 7), and apoptosis analyses (Fig. 8). The results showed that the S314A/T318A double mutant of ZPR9, which is defective in ASK1-mediated phosphorylation (see Fig. 3), had no effect on ASK1-mediated signaling to both JNK and p38 kinases, whereas a marked stimulation of ASK1 function was detected in the presence of wild-type ZPR9. These data strongly indicate that ZPR9-mediated stimulation of ASK1 signaling is dependent on ZPR9 phosphorylation at Ser314 and Thr318 by ASK1. In addition, it is possible that ASK1-mediated phosphorylation of ZPR9 at Ser314 and Thr318 may have an effect on the physical association between ASK1 and ZPR9. To test this, an in vivo binding assay was performed with expression vectors for GST-ASK1 and FLAG-tagged wild-type and mutant forms (S314A/T318A and C305S/C308S) of ZPR9. The results showed that the S314A/T318A double mutant, like the C305S/C308S double mutant (see Fig. 2B), failed to form a complex with ASK1 (supplemental Fig. S1), further supporting that it has an important role for the direct phosphorylation of ZPR9 at Ser314 and Thr318 in the positive regulation of ASK1 signaling. We previously showed that STRAP, a TGF-β receptor-interacting protein, physically interacts with ASK1 through cysteine residues, Cys152 and Cys270 of STRAP and Cys1351 and Cys1360 of ASK1, and inhibits ASK1 function (18Jung H. Seong H.A. Manoharan R. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 54-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, our present results show that Cys305 and Cys308 of ZPR9 and Cys1351 and Cys1360 of ASK1 are responsible for complex formation (Fig. 2), indicating that both ZPR9 and STRAP utilize the same cysteine residues (Cys1351 and Cys1360) of ASK1 for their binding to ASK1. Based on this, it was investigated whether the direct interaction between ASK1 and ZPR9, a putative positive regulator of ASK1, can influence complex formation between ASK1 and its negative regulator, STRAP, using in vivo binding assays. As expected, a marked decrease in the association between ASK1 and STRAP was observed in the presence of wild-type ZPR9 compared with the control expressing ASK1 and STRAP in the absence of ZPR9. Meanwhile, the ZPR9 double mutants (C305S/C308S and S314A/T318A) that lack the ability to bind with ASK1 had no effect on the ASK1-STRAP association (supplemental Fig. S2). These results suggest that, in addition to the modulation of known regulators of ASK1, such as Trx and 14-3-3 (Fig. 6), ZPR9 stimulates ASK1-mediated signaling by destabilizing complex formation between ASK1 and STRAP, recently identified as a negative regulator of ASK1 (18Jung H. Seong H.A. Manoharan R. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 54-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), probably through competition with STRAP. We previously found that ZPR9 was involved in TNF-α- or retinoic acid-induced apoptosis (22Seong H.A. Kim K.T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9655-9662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which ZPR9 induces apoptotic cell death remain unknown. To evaluate one possible explanation for this, the role of ASK1-mediated ZPR9 phosphorylation in the regulation of apoptosis induced by TNF-α or retinoic acid was investigated. The effect of wild-type ZPR9 on apoptosis in response to TNF-α or retinoic acid was compared with that in the presence of the S314A/T318A double mutant of ZPR9. The results showed that the S314A/T318A double mutant had no effect on apoptosis induced by the apoptotic stimuli TNF-α and retinoic acid when compared with the control in the absence of ZPR9 (supplemental Fig. S3). A similar trend was also observed in the analysis of apoptosis induced by other apoptotic stimuli tested, including H2O2, thapsigargin, ionomycin, and TGF-β (data not shown). These data suggest that ZPR9 phosphorylation at Ser314 and Thr318 may play an important role in the regulation of ZPR9-mediated apoptosis induced by various apoptotic stimuli. However, our present results do not rule out the possibility that ZPR9 phosphorylation at other sites may contribute to the regulation of ZPR9-mediated apoptosis. This is because ZPR9 was also phosphorylated by MPK38 serine/threonine kinase (data not shown), which was previously shown to participate in ASK1- and Smad-mediated signaling (10Jung H. Seong H.A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34541-34553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Seong H.A. Jung H. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 30959-30970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this context, the further identification and characterization of potential phosphorylation sites of ZPR9 for other intracellular kinases may aid in the deciphering of the exact mechanism through which ZPR9 induces apoptotic cell death in response to apoptotic stimuli. In addition, the broad expression of ZPR9 in various human tissues and cell lines (19Seong H.A. Gil M. Kim K.T. Kim S.J. Ha H. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 597-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) together with its role in apoptosis may explain in part the phenotype of ZPR9 knock-out mice, which show embryonal lethality (data not shown). We imagine that the ZPR9-mediated inhibition of PDK1 signaling likely plays a role that is important in the ZPR9 null phenotype rather than the ZPR9-mediated MKK3/6 activation. Additionally, we speculate that ZPR9 directly and indirectly contributes to the inhibition of PDK1 signaling by regulating Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473 through interference with PDK1 (Fig. 9) and mTORC2 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2; data not shown), respectively. In summary, our studies indicate that ZPR9, previously identified as a MPK38-interacting protein (19Seong H.A. Gil M. Kim K.T. Kim S.J. Ha H. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 597-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), induces the activation of ASK1-mediated signaling to both JNK and p38 kinases and that the ASK1-mediated phosphorylation of ZPR9 at Ser314 and Thr318 is responsible for ASK1 activation. This potential role of ZPR9 as a novel stimulator of ASK1-mediated signaling may help to clarify the regulatory mechanism(s) of ASK1-mediated signaling in cells. Moreover, the present findings regarding ZPR9 phosphorylation-dependent regulation of apoptosis in response to various apoptotic stimuli tested in this study will increase our understanding of the putative mechanism(s) through which ZPR9 induces apoptotic cell death. However, to clarify this issue, it will be necessary to further investigate other possible functional links between ASK1 and other ZPR9-mediated signaling pathways as ASK1 signaling can associate with MPK38 signaling pathways in which ZPR9 acts as a physiological substrate.

Phosphorylation stabilizes the ionic and hydrophobic interactions between monomers. Recent studies have shown that some response regulators retain functional activity in the absence of phosphorylation and are termed atypical response regulators. The two currently available receiver domain structures of atypical response regulators are very similar to their phospho-accepting homologs, and their propensity to form homodimers is generally retained. An atypical response regulator, ChxR, from Chlamydia trachomatis, was previously reported to form homodimers; however, the residues critical to this interaction have not been elucidated. We hypothesize that the intra- and intermolecular interactions involved in forming a transcriptionally competent ChxR are distinct from the canonical phosphorylation (activation) paradigm in the OmpR/PhoB response regulator subfamily. To test this hypothesis, structural and functional studies were performed on the receiver domain of ChxR. Two crystal structures of the receiver domain were solved with the recently developed method using triiodo compound I3C. These structures revealed many characteristics unique to OmpR/PhoB subfamily members: typical or atypical. Included was the absence of two α-helices present in all other OmpR/PhoB response regulators. Functional studies on various dimer interface residues demonstrated that ChxR forms relatively stable homodimers through hydrophobic interactions, and disruption of these can be accomplished with the introduction of a charged residue within the dimer interface. A gel shift study with monomeric ChxR supports that dimerization through the receiver domain is critical for interaction with DNA.

A gel shift study with monomeric ChxR supports that dimerization through the receiver domain is critical for interaction with DNA. Two-component signal transduction systems are important mechanisms that mediate many physiological functions within an organism. The output response of these systems is generally an alteration of gene expression (1Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar, 2Wang S. Engohang-Ndong J. Smith I. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 14751-14761Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The prototypical two-component system consists of a membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase that transfers a phosphoryl group to a cognate response regulator (3Gao R. Stock A.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 63: 133-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the response regulator stabilizes the active form of the protein, which promotes oligomerization through a receiver domain. Oligomerization facilitates an effector domain to interact with DNA and the transcriptional machinery. Although the genes regulated by these transcription factors vary, a highly conserved protein architecture and residue composition (i.e. structure and sequence) appears to be critical for a canonical mechanism of activation. The topology of the receiver domain (β1-α1-β2-α2-β3-α3-β4-α4-β5-α5) is highly conserved among response regulators (3Gao R. Stock A.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 63: 133-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 4Bourret R.B. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2010; 13: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition to the conserved domain architecture, the current understanding of the mechanism of activation within these proteins is derived from comparisons of multiple structures of these proteins in both the inactive (unphosphorylated) and active (phosphorylated) state (5Toro-Roman A. Mack T.R. Stock A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 6Bachhawat P. Stock A.M. J.

Structure. 2005; 13: 1353-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The cognate sensor kinase transfers a phosphoryl group to a conserved phospho-accepting Asp in the receiver domain of the response regulator. An essential Mg2+ ion and a Lys residue assist in the transfer and retention of the phosphoryl group within the binding site (8Solá M. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Serrano L. González A. Coll M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 9Bachhawat P. Swapna G.V. Montelione G.T. Stock A.M. Structure. 2005; 13: 1353-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The activation signal is then transduced to the dimer interface (α4-β5-α5) through the reorientation of two conformational switch residues (Thr/Ser and Tyr/Phe) toward the phosphoryl group. The reorientation of these two residues and subtle conformational changes throughout the protein dramatically enhances homodimer formation by properly aligning residues within the dimer interface that are involved in ionic and hydrophobic interactions between monomers. Homodimer formation through the receiver domain enhances the ability of the effector domain to bind to DNA and regulate transcription (10Mack T.R. Gao R. Stock A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 389: 349-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). An increasing number of response regulators have been identified that appear to not rely on a sensor kinase or a phosphorylation event for activation. These atypical response regulators do not retain many of the residues critical to the canonical phosphorylation (activation) process (4Bourret R.B. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2010; 13: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For example, HP1043, from Helicobacter pylori, lacks the canonical phospho-accepting Asp but is still capable of forming homodimers and interacting with DNA in the absence of phosphorylation (11Hong E. Lee H.M. Ko H. Kim D.U. Jeon B.Y. Jung J. Shin J. Lee S.A. Kim Y. Jeon Y.H. Cheong C. Cho H.S. Lee W. J. Biol.

Two experimentally determined structures of atypical receiver domains have shown that the conserved structural topology of the typical response regulators is largely retained (11Hong E. Lee H.M.

The structural elements that maintain their phosphorylation-independent activity, however, are poorly understood due to the paucity of functional and structural studies of these proteins. The medically important bacteria Chlamydia encodes a transcriptional regulator termed ChxR. Transcriptional regulation has been determined to be a key factor in the development and pathogenesis of Chlamydia (17Belland R.J. Zhong G. Crane D.D. Hogan D. Sturdevant D. Sharma J. Beatty W.L. Caldwell H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 8478-8483Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 18Nicholson T.L. Olinger L. Chong K. Schoolnik G. Stephens R.S. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3179-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Largely due to a lack of a system for directed gene disruption in Chlamydia, the ability to determine a specific biological role for ChxR has been impeded; however, prior studies support that the function of ChxR is exerted during the middle and late stages of the developmental cycle, which includes generation of the infectious form of Chlamydia (i.e. elementary body) (16Hickey J.M. Weldon L. Hefty P.S. J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Koo I.C. Walthers D. Hefty P.S. Kenney L.J. Stephens R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Given the relative paucity of alternative transcription factors encoded by Chlamydia, the number of putative ChxR binding sites throughout the genome (16Hickey J.M. Weldon L. Hefty P.S. J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the restricted growth conditions (obligate intracellular), it is expected that ChxR plays an important role in biology of Chlamydia (20Hickey, J. M., Spedding, L., Jaafar, Z. A., Hefty, P. S. (2010) Chlamydial Infections: Proceedings of the 12th International Symposium of Human Chlamydial Infections, Hof bei Salzburg, Austria, June 20–25, 2010, (Schachter, J., Byrne, G., Caldwell, H., Chernesky, M. A., Clarke, I. N., Mabey, D. C., Paavonen, J., Saikku, P., Starnbach, M., Stary, A., Stephens, R. S., Timms, P., Wyrick, P. B. eds) pp. 313–316, University Press, San Francisco, CA.Google Scholar). ChxR was identified from primary sequence homology to be a member of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily of response regulators (21Stephens R.S. Kalman S. Lammel C. Fan J. Marathe R. Aravind L. Mitchell W. Olinger L. Tatusov R.L. Zhao Q. Koonin E.V. Davis R.W. Science. 1998; 282: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). Computational analysis indicated that ChxR lacks the phospho-accepting Asp, and a cognate sensor kinase was not identified within the chlamydial genome, suggesting that the function of ChxR is not directly controlled by phosphorylation (19Koo I.C. Walthers D. Hefty P.S. Kenney L.J. Stephens R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Functional studies have reported that ChxR exists as a stable homodimer and could activate transcription in the absence of phosphorylation (16Hickey J.M. Weldon L. Hefty P.S. J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Koo I.C. Walthers D. Hefty P.S. Kenney L.J. Stephens R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although these results support the conclusion that ChxR is an atypical OmpR/PhoB transcriptional regulator, the critical structural features and molecular interactions that permit the protein to be maintained in an active state and thereby mimic phosphorylated response regulators have yet to be identified. We hypothesize that the intra- and intermolecular interactions involved in activation and dimerization of ChxR are distinct from the canonical phosphorylation (activation) paradigm in the OmpR/PhoB response regulator subfamily. To test this hypothesis, structural and functional studies were performed with the receiver domain of ChxR to identify the residues and structural features necessary for dimerization. ChxR receiver domain full-length ChxR YycF receiver domain 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalic acid root mean square. ChxR receiver domain full-length ChxR YycF receiver domain 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalic acid root mean square. DNA encoding the receiver domain of ChxR (ChxRRec, residues 2–113) was PCR-amplified using Chlamydia trachomatis LGV (L2/434/Bu) genomic DNA and primers for ChxRRec (5′-GGAATTCCATATGCAGGGCCTAAACATGTG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGATGTAGCGAATGCTGAGAAAG-3′) (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). The PCR product was digested with NdeI/XhoI and inserted into the N-terminal polyhistidine tag encoding pET28b vector (Novagen, San Diego, CA). ChxRRec was expressed and purified as described for full-length ChxR (ChxRFL) (16Hickey J.M. Weldon L. Hefty P.S. J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein was initially purified using Co2+ affinity chromatography (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl. ChxRRec was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Sephacryl S-200 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl. Purified ChxRRec, concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 20 mm NaH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.0, 400 mm NaCl, was screened for crystallization in Compact Jr. (Emerald BioSystems, Bainbridge Island, WA) sitting drop vapor diffusion plates by mixing 1 μl of protein and 1 μl of crystallization solution equilibrated against 100 μl of the latter. Prismatic ChxRRec crystals were obtained from two crystallization conditions. ChxRRec crystals, belonging to a C-centered monoclinic lattice (space group C2), grew in ∼2 days at 4 °C from the Wizard 3 screen (Emerald Biosystems) condition #10 (20% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.2 m sodium thiocyanate). A tetragonal crystal form (space group I41) grew in ∼2 days at 4 °C from the Precipitant Synergy screen (Emerald Biosystems) condition #7 and pHat screen (Emerald Biosystems) condition #42 (4 m NaCl, 5% isopropyl alcohol, and 100 mm NaH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.0). Single crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing 80% crystallization solution and 20% ethylene glycol before flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen for data collection. For SIRAS phasing, a crystal belonging to the C2 form was soaked for 5 min in 50 mm 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalic acid (I3C, Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) (22Beck T. Krasauskas A. Gruene T. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2008; 64: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) dissolved in crystallization solution before the transfer to the cryoprotectant solution. Diffraction data for structure solution using the SIRAS phasing method were collected at 93 K at the University of Kansas Protein Structure Laboratory using a Rigaku RU-H3R rotating anode generator (Cu-Kα) equipped with an R-axis IV2+ image plate detector and osmic blue focusing mirrors. The exposure time for each 1° oscillation image was 8 min at a detector distance of 150 mm. Intensities were integrated and scaled using the HKL2000 package (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Method Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Structure solution was carried out using the SIRAS phasing method with the SHELX C/D/E software package (24Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 2008; 64: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (80764) Google Scholar) via the CCP4 interface (25Collaborative Computational Project, NActa Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Iodine positions corresponding to three I3C sites were identified using SHELXC and SHELXD that yielded correlation coefficient all/weak of 38.80/27.17. Calculation of initial phase angles and density modification were conducted with SHELXE and yielded a pseudo-free correlation coefficient of 69.28% and an estimated mean figure of merit of 0.653 for the inverted substructure. BUCCANNER (26Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 1002-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar) was used to generate a Cα trace of the model for future molecular replacement against the high resolution native data. High resolution native ChxRRec (C2 space group) data were collected at 100 K at the IMCA-CAT beamline 17BM at the Advanced Photon Source using an ADSC Quantum 210r CCD detector at a wavelength of 1.0 Å. The exposure time for each 1° oscillation image was 5 s. Intensities were integrated and scaled using D*TREK (27Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). High resolution native ChxRRec (I41 space group) data were collected at 100 K at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory beamline 9-2 using an MAR325 detector at a distance of 170 mm, a wavelength of 1.54 Å, an exposure time of 5 s and a 1° oscillation per image. Intensities were integrated and scaled using MOSFLM and SCALA (28Evans P. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3767) Google Scholar), respectively. A Cα model obtained from SIRAS phasing with I3C was used as the search model for molecular replacement with PHASER (29McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14567) Google Scholar) against the high resolution synchrotron data. Initial automated model building was carried out using ARP/wARP (30Langer G. Cohen S.X. Lamzin V.S. Perrakis A. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Anisotropic atomic displacement parameters were modeled by TLS refinement 7 groups as generated by the TLSMD server (31Painter J. Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Final model building and structure refinement were performed with COOT (32Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar) and PHENIX (33Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Kapral G.J.

Open table in a new tab For the 1.6 Å resolution model, monomer A comprises residues 2–111, and monomer B comprises residues 4–37, 43–60, and 68–110. The model contained two ethylene glycol molecules and 106 water molecules. For the 2.15 Å resolution model, monomer A comprises residues 4–54 and 66–110, and monomer B comprises residues 4–60 and 67–109. The model contained two sodium ions and 39 water molecules. For the 2.1 Å resolution structure, monomer A comprises residues 3–111, and monomer B comprises residues 4–37, 43–60, and 68–109. The model contained 75 water molecules and three I3C molecules. One I3C molecule is located at the interface between monomer A in the asymmetric unit and monomer B of a symmetric-related molecule. I2 is 2.8 Å away from the amide O of Leu-23, and O8 of one carboxyl group of the I3C molecule forms a hydrogen bond with the symmetry-related Lys-101 NZ (2.7Å) and Arg98 NH1 (3.0Å). The second I3C molecule is located at the solvent-exposed surface of monomer B. Hydrogen bonds are observed between four water molecules and N1, O8, O9, and O12 of the I3C molecule. Additionally, O9 forms a hydrogen bond with His-13 ND (2.8Å). The third I3C molecule is located at the solvent-exposed surface of monomer B. O8 of one carbonyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the amide N of Gln-35 (2.9Å) and a water molecule (3.0 Å). Additionally, O9 forms a hydrogen bond with Gln-35 NE2 (3.1 Å). CD analysis was performed with a Chirascan-plus circular dichroism spectrometer equipped with a Peltier temperature controller and a four-position cuvette holder (Applied Photophysics Ltd, Leatherhead, UK). Far UV spectra of YycFRec and ChxRRec and ChxRRecW89E at 0.1 mg/ml in CD buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl) were collected in the range of 190–260 nm using a 0.1-cm path length cuvette sealed with a Teflon stopper. A sampling time-per-point of 2 s and a bandwidth of 1 nm were used. The secondary structure components were estimated by the CDNN CD spectra deconvolution software (35Böhm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). CDNN is a neural networks method-based program that can be used to analyze data to determine the content of α-helix, parallel and anti-parallel β-structure, turns, and random coil. The results from the CDNN analysis were sorted automatically in five regions (190–260, 195–260, 200–260, 205–260, and 210–260 nm) for each secondary structure component. For each secondary component, results of five regions were averaged, and S.D. were calculated. Mutations were introduced into the ChxRFL and ChxRRec plasmids using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit and following the manufacturer's protocol (Agilent Technologies, La Jolla, CA). All clones were verified by DNA sequencing analysis (ACGT, Inc., Wheeling, Il). The proteins were overexpressed in pET28b and purified as described previously for ChxRFL (16Hickey J.M. Weldon L. Hefty P.S. J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) or above for ChxRRec. After purification, ChxRRec was concentrated to 100 μm using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA). ChxRRec was then diluted to 10 μm and 1 μm in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl. The proteins were applied to a Superdex 75 10/300 GL analytical size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl. For analytical size exclusion chromatography of ChxRRec, ChxRRecW89E, ChxRFL, and ChxRFLW89E, the proteins were concentrated to 10 μm and applied to a Superdex 75 10/300 GL analytical size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 250 mm KCl. A protein standard solution containing bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), horse myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa) (Bio-Rad) was used to generate a standard curve. ChxRFL and ChxRFLW89E in 20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl were subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation at a concentration of 23 and 27 μm, respectively. Each protein was loaded into two-channel, 12-mm optical path length cells and analyzed using a Beckman Coulter XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Palo Alto, CA). A four-hole An60 Ti rotor was used for housing the cells; each sample cell was run at 10 °C for 450 continuous scans. The speed of rotor was 120,000 × g for the sedimentation velocity analysis and was conducted using SEDFIT (Version 12.1b) (36Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3065) Google Scholar). Continuous c(s) distribution analysis was used by employing nonlinear regression during the data fit. In addition, viscosities and densities of the buffers were measured using the SVM 3000 viscometer (Anton Parr USA Inc., Ashland, VA) for accurate parameters used in the analytical ultracentrifugation fitting process. Each experiment was performed in duplicate. An EMSA to test DNA binding by ChxR was performed as previously described (16Hickey J.M. Weldon L. Hefty P.S. J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) with IR800-labeled DNA corresponding to the high affinity (DR2) binding site within the chxR promoter. The assays were performed at a protein concentration of 44 nm, which is the approximate dissociation constant for this binding site (i.e. 50% of this DNA sequence is shifted at this protein concentration) and would thus permit maximal variation in the amount of DNA bound with the substitutions (16Hickey J.M. Weldon L. Hefty P.S. J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The binding reactions contained 1 nm DNA and either 44 nm wild-type or variant ChxRFL. The DNA was visualized and quantified using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). The effector domain of ChxR used in this assay was purified as described previously (37Hickey J.M. Hefty P.S. Lamb A.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2009; 65: 791-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Purified ChxRFL in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, and 50 mm MgCl was incubated with 1, 10, or 100 mm acetyl phosphate (Sigma). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the reaction was subjected to native PAGE, and protein bands were visualized through Coomassie staining. For DNA binding analysis, ChxRFL was incubated with 100 mm acetyl phosphate for 1 h before the analysis. An EMSA was performed in triplicate with 1 nm DR2 DNA and 44 mm concentrations of either untreated or acetyl phosphate-treated ChxRFL. The amount of DNA shifted was quantified as described above. A prior study reported that ChxR could activate transcription despite the absence of a phospho-accepting Asp (16Hickey J.M. Weldon L. Hefty P.S. J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Koo I.C. Walthers D. Hefty P.S. Kenney L.J. Stephens R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); however, a comprehensive analysis of other residues that may be important to its function has not been performed.

Here, we have studied DC2 and KCP2, and we have established that DC2 and KCP2 are substrate-specific, affecting amyloid precursor protein (APP), indicating that they are not core components required for N-glycosylation and OST activity per se. We show for the first time that DC2 and KCP2 depletion affects APP processing, leading to an accumulation of C-terminal fragments, both C99 and C83, and a reduction in full-length mature APP. This reduction in mature APP levels was not due to a block in secretion because the levels of sAPPα secreted into the media were unaffected. We discover that DC2 and KCP2 depletion affects only the γ-secretase complex, resulting in a reduction of the PS1 active fragment blocking Aβ production. Conversely, we show that the overexpression of DC2 and KCP2 causes an increase in the active γ-secretase complex, particularly the N-terminal fragment of PS1 that is generated by endoproteolysis, leading to a stimulation of Aβ production upon overexpression of DC2 and KCP2. Our findings reveal that components of the OST complex for the first time can interact with the γ-secretase and affect the APP processing pathway.
