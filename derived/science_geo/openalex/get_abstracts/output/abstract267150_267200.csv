https://openalex.org/W2024728693,"The microtubules present in the cortices of plant cells are found to have a wall made up of slender filamentous subunits, probably 13 in number, which have a center-to-center spacing of about 45 angstrom units. Thus the micromorphology of these tubules is similar to that reported for the 9 + 2 fibrils of rat sperm flagella. This structure can be used to account for a primary function of motion attributable to the microtubules."

Replacement of the exocyclic methylene groupattached to ring D by a keto-, methyl-, hydroxymethyl-, carboxy-, or methylcarboxy group resulted in compounds which were biologically inactive. These kaurene derivatives are structurally related to the gibberellins which produce a similar type of elongation for the d-5 and an-1 mutants."

https://openalex.org/W2022701274,"A physonectid siphonophore, Nanomia bijuga, associated with a verticallymigrating deep scattering layer, has been observed with a gasfilled float at depths in excess of 300 meters in the sea. This implies that gas is secreted and maintained in the pneumatophore against a diffusion gradient of 30 atmospheres or more. Analysis of the enclosed gases revealed concentrations of carbon monoxide exceeding 90 percent. Necessary voiding of this gas during a vertical ascent of 300 meters could give rise to a transient population of bubbles which would act as sound-reflecting targets."
https://openalex.org/W2037212870,"The saturation concentration of calcium carbonate, equilibrated with aragonitic oolites, is about 2.7 times larger after exposure to 1000 atmospheres than it is when saturation is achieved at 1 atmosphere. This sugests that deep ocean waters may be undersaturated with calcium carbonate, in which case the alkalinity of the oceans would increase as sinking calcareous organisms dissolve."
https://openalex.org/W2036520937,The concentrations of uranium impurities in a variety of ancient man-made glasses have been determined by counting the sites of neutron-induced fissions. There appears to be a chronological trend from low to high and back to low uranium contents over the past three millennia. Crude estimates of ages by fission-track counting should be possiblewith considerable labor for the group of glasses which was found to have the highest concentration of uranium.

https://openalex.org/W1987509710,"Neutron activation measurements of rhenium and osmium abundances in the Orgueil, Mokoia, Karoonda, Mocs, and Hvittis chondrites indicate no fractionation of these elementsbetween the various chondrite types. The average abundances in chondritic material are RE = 60.3 X 10(-9)g/g and Os =710 X 10(-9)g/g (Os/ Re = 11.5). The rhenium abundance in the Bishopville enstatite achondrite is about 1/300 as much, and the osmium abundances about 1/100 as much, as theabundances in parental enstatite chondrites, indicating that most of the rhenium and osmium in the enstatite chondrites is in the metallic phase."

https://openalex.org/W2020131010,In the urine of men and animals was found a factor which evokes the contraction of the gall bladder. This factor increases in the urine after the application of a secretogenous stimulus to the duodenum and decreases after resection of the duodenum. A urine concentrate was prepared which has an effect similar to that of cholecystokinin administered intravenously and which was therefore called urocholecystokinin.

https://openalex.org/W2054982822,"When gamma rays pass through purified, degassed, liquid hydrocarbons held in an electric field, large current pulses are observed, indicating electron multiplication. This seems to indicate that free electrons are stable in these liquids and that their mean free paths may be much greater than had been thought."
https://openalex.org/W2086013975,"The crystal habit of stishovite changes with the temperature of crystallization at a pressure of about 120 kb. Below 600 degrees C it is bipyramidal; between 600 degrees and 900 degrees C it is granular; and above 900 degrees C it is acicular. This temperature dependence of the crystal habit of stishovite may constitute a highpressure geological thermometer which could indicate limiting values for the peak temperatures that prevailed at craters of meteoritic origin in highly siliceous rocks. It suggests that natural acicular stishovite from the rim sandstone at Meteor Crater, Arizona, crystallized at temperatures above 900 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W2138573364,"A preceramic site at San Vicente Chicoloapan, in the Valley of Mexico, disclosed a human burial associated with stone-lined hearths and artifacts. The prevalence of primitive grinding stones suggests a collecting economy of the ""Chalco culture,"" now for the first time recognized as such, and belonging to a long-headed people that succeeded Tepexpan Man some 8000 to 6000 years ago."

https://openalex.org/W2027598158,Nondisjunction in mitotic divisions occurs spontaneously at a low frequency in somatic and germinal tissue in maize and results in sectors of trisomic cells. When this happens with chromosome 3 and in germinal tissue the embryo sac development is changed from the normal monosporic type to a tetrasporic type which is common in some species but not in maize.
