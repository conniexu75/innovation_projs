https://openalex.org/W1968902673,"Chicken hematopoietic cells transformed in vitro and in vivo by seven strains of replication-defective avian leukemia viruses were assayed for the expression of six erythroid and five myeloid differentiation parameters, including differentiation-specific surface antigens as detected by newly developed antisera. The transformed cells were found to display three distinct phenotypes of differentiation. First, cells transformed by AEV resemble erythroblasts. They express heme, globin, carbonic anhydrase and erythrocyte cell surface antigen at low levels, and histone H5 and erythroblast cell surface antigen at high levels. Second, cells transformed by MC29, CMII, OK10 and MH2 viruses have macrophage-like properties. They strongly express Fc receptors, phagocytic capacity and macrophage cell surface antigen, but only weakly express myeloblast cell surface antigen and are negative for ATPase activity. Third, cells transformed by AMV and E26 viruses resemble myeloblasts in that they weakly express Fc receptors, phagocytic capacity and macrophage cell surface antigen but strongly express myeloblast cell surface antigen and ATPase activity. No difference was found between in vitro- and in vivo-transformed cells in the parameters tested. In light of recent genetic and biochemical evidence, we believe that these phenotypes reflect the action of three new types of viral-transforming genes, designated erb (erythroblast), mac (macrophage) and myb (myeloblast)."

https://openalex.org/W1972804002,"Both the introduction and the removal of supertwists by DNA gyrase change the linking number of DNA in steps of two. This surprising finding provides strong evidence that gyrase acts by a mechanism, called sign inversion, whereby a positive supercoil is directly inverted into a negative one via a transient double-strand break."

https://openalex.org/W2126370064,"Paraquat mediates a superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c by suspensions of Escherichia coli B. Glucose was most effective in providing electrons for this cytochrome c reduction, but other nutrients could serve in this capacity, provided the cells were preconditioned by growth on these nutrients. Paraquat reduction depended upon a NADPH:paraquat diaphorase, present in the cytosol. Reduced paraquat could diffuse across the cell envelope and react with dioxygen, in the suspending medium, thus generating O2- in that compartment. Most of the paraquat reduced in the cell, under the conditions used, reoxidized in situ and most of the O2- production was thus intracellular. The partitioning of reduced paraquat between intracellular and extracellular compartments, prior to reaction with dioxygen, depended upon intracellular pO2 and any strategy which raised intracellular pO2 decreased the efflux of reduced paraquat and thus decreased extracellular O2- production. Extracellular O2- and H2O2 did contribute to cell damage in proportion to the amount produced. O2- appeared to be unable to cross the cell envelope in either direction and the only O2- which was effective in raising the rate of biosynthesis of the manganese-superoxide dismutase, was that generated within the cell."

https://openalex.org/W2032547599,"The effect of physostigmine on recent memory was evaluated in young and aged rhesus monkeys. All aged monkeys had previously shown impaired memory. The performance of the young monkeys treated with physostigmine was similar to that recently reported for young humans--no effects at low doses, some improvement at a restricted range of doses, and deficits at the highest dose. Although the aged subjects also improved at the same general doses, their overall response as a group was much more variable than that of the younger subjects. The performance of some aged monkeys was impaired by low doses that did not affect young monkeys. Continued improvement was observed in some aged monkeys at the highest dose, which typically impaired young monkeys. These variable effects across aged subjects suggest that physostigmine cannot easily or reliably be used as an agent for treating geriatric cognition. Nevertheless, the differential age-related effects suggest that appropriate manipulation of the cholinergic system may eventually be developed to alleviate some of the cognitive impairments suffered by aged subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2007089478,"During the early stage of Ad2 infection of human cells, RNA is transcribed from five separate transcription units. Early region II encodes the mRNA for a 72K single-stranded DNA binding protein (DBP) which functions in DNA replication. This report describes the structure of the first leader of the DBP mRNA and the flanking sequences in the DNA. The leader, labeled in vivo with 32P, was isolated by DNA filter hybridization to the viral restriction fragment Eco RI F, and its RNAase T1 and RNAase A oligonucleotides were analyzed by RNA fingerprinting techniques. Comparison of this RNA sequence information with the DNA sequence of Eco RI F has located a 68 nucleotide region of the Hae III C subfragment at coordinate 75.1 that encodes the leader. This position is near the coordinate to which nascent chain analysis and ultraviolet transcription mapping have mapped an RNA initiation site, or promoter, for the DBP mRNA. The DNA sequence that overlaps the leader on the 3' side contains a donor sequence for splicing this leader to a second downstream leader. The splicing sequence shows a seven base homology with the comparable structure of the Ad2 major late leader, and a mouse globin mRNA splicing sequence. The DNA sequence upstream from the cap, the region oof the potential promoter site does not, however, contain a ""TA-TAAA""-type homology of the sort noted by D. Hogness, M. Goldberg and R. Lifton (personal communication) for many cellular transcription units, and by other investigations for the Ad2 major late transcription unit. Also, the leader is found with two distinct capped 5' termini, 7meGpppA and 7meGpppG, which are encoded at adjacent positions in the DNA and thus are from mRNAs which are staggered by one nucleotide in length at the 5' end. The staggering at the 5' terminus and the lack of the upstream homolgy distinguish the DBP mRNA from many viral and cellular messenger. In both these respects, however, the DBP mRNA resembles the late messengers of SV40 and polyoma viruses. In this paper, we discuss the implications of these findings for the mechanism of specifying mRNA 5' ends."
https://openalex.org/W1988383633,"SV40 DNA replicated in the presence of cycloheximide was more sensitive to staphylococcal nuclease digestion and had a lower superhelical density than viral DNA replicated in the absence of this drug. These data indicate that fewer nucleosomes are associated with progeny SV40 DNA molecules after DNA replication in the absence of protein synthesis and that these nucleosomes are derived from the parental histones. We designed an experiment to determine whether these parental SV40 nucleosomes segregate to the leading side of the replication form where DNA synthesis is continuous, the lagging side of the fork where DNA synthesis is discontinuous or randomly to both sides of the fork. The results indicate that the parental histones distributed themselves asymmetrically, preferentially (80-90%) segregating with the leading side of both SV40 DNA replication forks during bidirectional replication in the absence of protein synthesis. In the case of SV40, the same parental DNA strands are the templates for the leading side of DNA replication at both forks as well as the templates for the informational or coding strand of early and late viral mRNA synthesis. Based on this correspondence, we designed an experiment to test whether chicken cells growing in culture and replicating their DNA in the absence of protein synthesis segregated their parental histones asymmetrically to the progeny DNA strand that also coded for stable nuclear RNA transcripts. The results of these experiments indicate that, like SV40, parental cellular histones segregate asymmetrically and are preferentially associated with those DNA template strands that code for stable nuclear RNA species detected by hybridization to single-copy DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2069717128,"Restriction endonucleases can be used to define the structure and position of genetic loci for which specific molecular hybridization reagents are available. We have used this approach to compare 18 chicken embryos with respect to several cellular genes; endogenous viral DNA related to the replicative genes of avian sarcoma virus (ASV) or to RAV-O, an endogenous virus of chickens; and sequences related to the transforming (src) gene of ASV. Each cellular gene eas remarkably homogeneous within our test population. We found little or no variation in globin and ovomucoid genes; ovalbumin and transferrin (with one exception) showed variation which is probably allelic in nature. The endogenous viral DNA which has homology with RAV-O was found at several different positions in host DNA and its structure resembled that of proviruses acquired by experimental infection, with sequences from both ends of viral RNA repeated near both ends of viral DNA. Within the population of 18 chickens, one endogenous provirus was always present, whereas the several other proviruses were each found in only a few members of this group. However, screening of additional chickens identified individuals lacking the provirus common to the initial 18 animals surveyed; in at least one embryo no RAV-O-related DNA was detected. These findings suggest that the endogenous RAV-O-related sequences have entered the germ line by relatively recent infection and are still segregating in several contemporary chicken flocks. The sequences in the chicken genome which have homology with the src gene of ASV are invariant from bird to bird and in this sense resemble a cellular gene rather than a viral sequence."

https://openalex.org/W2151607232,"The role of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the regulation of prolactin (PRL) receptors in granulosa cells was investigated. After 2 days of incubation in a chemically defined medium, the specific binding of lz51- PRL to cultured granulosa cells was low (1.01 + 0.23 fmol/106 cells). In contrast, addition of FSH (100 ng/ ml) caused a 3-fold increase in the specific binding of lz51-PRL (3.86 f 0.33 fmol/106 cells). In viuo administra- tion of FSH for 2 days caused a similar 3-fold increase in 12’I-PRL to granulosa cells. FSH (1 pg) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; 1 pg) did not displace 12’I-PRL, but human growth hormone (hGH) was as effective as PRL in competing for 12’I-PRL binding sites. The effect of PRL on progesterone, 20a-dihydropro- gesterone, and estrogen biosynthesis was investigated. During a B-day incubation in defined media containing 100 nM androstenedione (aromatase substrate), control and PRL-treated cells from unprimed animals secreted negligible amounts of steroid hormones. However, after pretreatment for 2 days in vitro with FSH (100 rig/ml), these cells responded to PRL (1 gg/ml) by showing a 5- fold and 3-fold increase in progesterone and 2Oa-dihy- droprogesterone production, respectively. In contrast, PRL did not increase estrogen formation by such cells, indicating the PRL effect was specifically coupled to progestin synthesis. The stimulatory effect of PRL on progesterone synthesis was dose-related; the minimal and apparent maximal effective doses of PRL were 30 rig/ml and 1 pg/ml, respectively. A dose-related in- crease in 20a-dihydroprogesterone was also observed with PRL but it was less than the progesterone re- sponse. Comparable steroidogenic responses to PRL were observed with granulosa cells pretreated with FSH for 2 days in viva, suggesting our in vitro obser- vations reflect a normal physiological event. The pro- gesterone/20a-dihydroprogesterone ratio was signifi- cantly decreased (a-fold) by PRL over control and FSH- treated cells, suggesting PRL decreased 20a-hydroxy- steroid dehydrogenase activity. These results demonstrate that 1) FSH stimulates the formation of specific PRL receptors in granulosa cells in vitro and in uiuo, 2) the FSH-induced PRL receptors"
https://openalex.org/W2027928736,"In addition to large T and small t antigens, cells transformed by simian virus 40 (SV40) commonly contain other proteins which specifically immunoprecipitate with SV40 anti-T serum and which are not detected in untransformed cells. The additional tumor antigens (T-Ags) fall into two groups: those having a close structural relationship with normal SV40 T-Ags, and those unrelated to large T and small t. The latter are probably nonviral T-Ags (NVT-Ags). The NVT-Ags comprise a family of proteins of molecular weight 50,000-55,000. Fingerprint analysis shows that NVT-Ags have few if any peptides in common with large T or small t, and that they lack the amino terminal tryptic peptide and the peptides unique to small t. NVT-Ags from different species have different fingerprints, but those isolated from different transformants of the same cell line are identical. The size of NVT is unaltered in cells transformed by mutants of SV40 with deletions in the region 0.60-0.55 map units. The mRNA for NVT does not hybridize to SV40 DNA. The other forms of T-Ag isolated from transformed cells fall into three classes: shortened forms of large T (truncated large T); multiple species of T-Ag with molecular weights very similar to, but distinct from, those of normal large T (large T doublets and triplets); and elongated forms of large T (super T). These proteins all contain the normal amino terminus of SV40 T-Ags, and the truncated forms of large T lack peptides from the carboxy terminal half of large T. One species of super T (molecular weight 130,000) contains only those methionine tryptic peptides present in normal large T, although it may contain some peptides in more than one copy."

https://openalex.org/W2064268888,"Two antigenic variants of visna virus were isolated sequentially from a single sheep inoculated with a plaque-purified strain of virus designated 1514. The genetically stable variants, LV1-1 and LV1-4, are of two classes: LV1-1 is partially neutralized by antibody to the inoculum strain 1514, while LV1-4 is not neutralized by antibody to 1514. The genetic mechanism responsible for generating the antigenic variants was investigated by comparing the chymotryptic and tryptic maps of the envelope glycoprotein gp135 and core polypeptides (p30, p16, p14), and by comparing the pattern of large oligonucleotides produced by digestion of the RNAs by T1 ribonuclease. We show that only the peptide maps of gp135 differ among strains, that the number of peptide fragments altered is small and that gp135 is the polypeptide that elicits neutralizing antibody. The maps of the RNAs are identical. We conclude that mutation in the glycoprotein gene rather than recombination is more probably responsible for antigenic variation, and speculate on the special aspects of visna virus replication relevant to this phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2012426220,"The activity of Na+, K+-activated adenosinetriphosphatase and the uptake of a potassium analog, rubidium, were found to be similar in cerebral microvessels and choroid plexus when measured in vitro. This similarity suggests that sodium and potassium concentrations in the nascent brain extracellular fluid are determined by the same active process that regulates their concentration in nascent cerebrospinal fluid. The brain microvessels may thereby play an active role in brain potassium homeostasis and brain extracellular fluid formation."

https://openalex.org/W1481712436,"Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of the myosin light chains in bovine aortic native actomyosin is markedly depressed in the presence of cyclic AMP and its dependent protein kinase. This inhibition occurs with either cardiac, skeletal, or aortic protein kinase plus cyclic AMP, while little or no inhibition occurs with either cyclic AMP or protein kinase alone. The extent of inhibition is related to the concentration of protein kinase and approaches a maximum of approximately 50%. Concomitant with the inhibition of myosin light chain phosphorylation is (a) an increased phosphorylation of a 100,000-dalton moiety which possibly corresponds to the myosin light chain kinase present in the native actomyosin preparation and (b) a decrease in the actomyosin Mg2+-ATPase activity. These findings suggest that modulation of actin-myosin interactions by the cAMP system directly at the level of the contractile proteins may represent a mechanism by which beta adrenergic relaxation occurs in mammalian vascular smooth muscle."

The receptors appeared in clusters on the cell surface, and no internalization was detected. No specific fluorescence or clusters were observed in the presence of [D-Ala2, Leu5]enkephalin or at 4 degrees C, and the clusters were much reduced under ionic conditions (that is, with 100 millimolars sodium) that specifically decrease the binding of opiate agonists."
https://openalex.org/W2157820630,"We have developed a two-dimensional method for simultaneously mapping on the yeast mtDNA genome all the transcripts representing more than 0.01% of mtRNA. In two yeast strains, Saccharomyces carlsbergensis NCYC-74 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae KL14-4A, about 25 discrete transcripts were found apart from tRNAs. The mtDNAs of these strains differ by the absence (NCYC-74) or presence (KL 14-4A) of various large insertions located within genetically active regions. The transcripts can all be related to known loci on the genetic map. In nearly all cases the RNAs are much longer than required to specify the known protein product of the locus concerned. The organization of the transcripts is similar in the two strains except at the positions of the large insertions (500-3300 bp) in the oxi-3 and cob loci. The sequences of these insertions are present in RNA species larger than 25S, but are absent from smaller transcripts of the same regions. This is probably due to splicing, since the coding sequences for most of these smaller transcripts are noncontiguous. The smaller transcripts of other loci also seem to arise from processing of larger RNA species. The oxi-3 locus, containing the structural gene for cytochrome c oxidase subunit l, is transcribed in a very complex fashion that suggests differential splicing into partially overlapping transcripts. This may indicate that oxi-3 has additional genetic functions, including possible control of the biosynthesis of cytochrome c oxidase holoenzyme or its assembly into the mitochondrial inner membrane. As in the case of the eucaryote nucleus, the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression seems to occur more at the level of RNA processing than has been recognized thus far."
https://openalex.org/W1532259512,"The DNA polymerase and gene 4 protein of phage T7, in the presence of helix-destabilizing protein (DNA binding protein), catalyze DNA synthesis on duplex templates. As has been previously shown (Kolodner, R. D., and Richardson, C. C. (1978) 4. Biol. Chem. 253, 574-584), in the absence of ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates DNA synthesis is initiated at nicks, and all of the newly synthesized DNA is covalently attached to the template. In this paper we characterize the DNA synthesized in the presence of ribonucleoside 5'-triphophates and show that, in contrast, the major portion of the newly synthesized DNA is not attached to the template, having an average chain length of 5000 to 6000 nucleotides. In addition, each chain of newly synthesized DNA is terminated at its 5'-end by a covalently attached tetranucleotide RNA primer whose sequence is predominantly pppApCpCpC and pppApCpCpA. The results of isotope transfer experiments are in agreement with the number of initiation events determined by the incorporation of [gamma-32P]ATP and indicate that each of the four deoxyribonucleotides is present at the RNA-DNA junction."

https://openalex.org/W1605809999,"Essentially all of the Okazaki fragments on replicating Simian virus 40 (SV40)DNA could be grouped into one of three classes. Class I Okazaki fragments (about 20%) were separated from longer nascent DNA chains by a single phosphodiester bond interruption (nick) and were quantitatively identified by treating purified replicating DNA with Escherichia coli DNA ligase and then measuring the fraction of Okazaki fragments joined to longer nascent DNA chains. Similarly, class II Okazaki fragments (about 30%) were separated by a region of single-stranded DNA template (gap) that could be filled and sealed by T4 DNA polymerase plus E. coli DNA ligase, and class III fragments (about 50%) were separated by RNA primers that could be removed with E. coli DNA olymerase I, allowing the fragments to be joined with E. coli DNA ligase. These results were obtained with replicating SV40 DNA that had been briefly labeled with radioactive precursors in either intact cells or isolated nuclei. When isolated nuclei were further incubated in the presence of cytosol, all of the Okazaki fragments were converted into longer DNA strands as expected for intermediates in DNA synthesis. However, when washed nuclei were incubated in the abscence of cytosol, both class I and class II Okazaki fragments accumulated despite the excision of RNA primers: class III Okazaki fragments and RNA-DNA covalent linkages both disappeared at similar rates. These data demonstrate the existence of RNA primers in whole cells as well as in isolated nuclei, and identify a unique gap-filling step that is not simply an extension of the DNA chain elongation process concomitant with the excision of RNA primers. One or more factos found in cytosol, in addition to DNA polymerase alpha, are specifically involved in the gap-filling and ligation steps. The sizes of mature Okazaki fragments (class I) and Okazaki fragments whose synthesis was completed by T4 DNA polymerase were measured by gel electrophoresis and found to be broadly distributed between 40 and 290 nucleotides with an average length of 135 nucleotides. Since 80% and 90% of the Okazaments does not occur at uniformly spaced intervals along the DNA template. During the excision of RNA primers, nascent DNA chains with a single ribonucleotide covalently attached to the 5' terminus were identified as transient intermediates. These intermediates accumulated during excision of RNA primers in the presence of adenine 9-beta-D-arabinoside 5'-triphosphate, and those Okazaki fragments blocked by RNA primers (class III) were found to have originated the farthest from the 5' ends of long nascent DNA strands. Thus, RNA primers appear to be excised in two steps with the second step, removal of the final ribonucleotide, being stimulated by concomitant DNA synthesis. These and other data were used to construct a comprehensive metabolic pathway for the initiation, elongation, and maturation of Okazaki fragments at mammalian DNA replication forks."

https://openalex.org/W1542796777,"DNA polymerase and gene 4 protein of bacteriophage T7 catalyze DNA synthesis on duplex DNA templates. Synthesis is initiated at nicks in the DNA template, and this leading strand synthesis results in displacement of one of the parental strands. In the presence of ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates the gene 4 protein catalyzes the synthesis of oligoribonucleotide primers on the displaced single strand, and their extension by T7 dna polymerase accounts for lagging strand synthesis. Since all the oligoribonucleotide primers bear adenosine 5'-triphosphate residues at their 5' termini, [gamma 32P]ATP is incorporated specifically into the product molecule, thus providing a rapid and sensitive assay for the synthesis of the RNA primers. Both primer synthesis and DNA synthesis are stimulated 3- to 5-fold by the presence of either Escherichia coli or T7 helix-destabilizing protein (DNA binding protein). ATP and CTP together fully satisfy the requirement for rNTPs and provide maximum synthesis of primers and DNA. Provided that T7 DNA polymerase is present, RNA-primed DNA synthesis occurs on either duplex or single-stranded DNA templates and to equal extents on either strand of T7 DNA. No primer-directed DNA synthesis occurs on poly(dT) or poly(dG) templates, indicating that synthesis of primers is template-directed."

Since 2 of these last ubiquinones are integral parts of the photochemical reaction center, we conclude that the ubiquinone-cytochrome b-c2 oxidoreductase requires only 1, or at most 2, molecules of ubiquinone-10 for its function. Earlier kinetic data identified a major electron donor to ferricytochrome c2 as a single molecule (known as Z) which requires 2 electrons and 2 protons for its equilibrium reduction. Hence, we identify a single molecule of quinone, probably ubiquinone-10 in a special environment, as a major electron donor to ferricytochrome c2 in the ubiquinone cytochrome b-c2 oxidoreductase."
https://openalex.org/W1607281048,"A number of experiments were performed to localize the oligosaccharide units on type I procollagen secreted by matrix-free chick embryo tendon cells.

Analysis of sugar-labeled pro-al and pro-a2 chains by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and DEAE-cellulose chromatography suggested that the pro-a2 chain may contain more man- nose than the pro-al chain. Subsequent pronase diges- tion of isolated [3H]mannose-labeled COOH-terminal propeptides from purified pro-al and pro-a2 yielded only a single glycopeptide fraction from each with an approximate M, = 2000 to 2200. These glycopeptides were resistant to cleavage by endo+-N-acetylglucosa- minidase D, but were susceptible to endo+N-acetyl- glucosaminidase H yielding oligosaccharide units of approximate Mr = 1400 to 1500.

https://openalex.org/W147204557,"Incorporation of labeled deoxynucleoside triphosphates into mtDNA by isolated rat liver mitochondria has been shown previously to reflect DNA replication. We have used this system to seek evidence for a mtDNA gyrase. Coumermycin, novobiocin, nalidixic acid, and oxolinic acid are known to be inhibitors of Escherichia coli gyrase, to inhibit E. coli DNA replication, to abolish colicin E1 replication, and to depress the supercoiling of phage lambda DNA, the last two via inhibition of the DNA gyrase. Our results show that these agents inhibit [3H]dATP incorporation into bulk mtDNA at concentrations similar to those used for E. coli. Analysis by sucrose gradient sedimentation confirms the inhibition and shows further that the synthesis of the highly supercoiled form of mtDNA (i.e. 39 S DNA) is depressed relative to other mtDNA forms (i.e. 27 S DNA), suggesting an inhibition of the supercoiling process. Analysis of the DNA by CsCl/propidium diiodide centrifugation shows, in addition, that incubation with coumermycin results in the appearance of a mtDNA form shown to be relaxed mtDNA. The results are consistent with the occurrence of a mtDNA gyrase and its operation in mtDNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1996604319,"We find that the protease inhibitor N-α-tosyl-L-lysyl chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) inhibits the transformation-specific kinase activity ( Collett and Erikson, 1978 Collett M.S. Erikson R.L. Protein kinase activity associated with the avian sarcoma virus src gene product. in: Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 75. 1978: 2021-2024 Google Scholar ) associated with p60src, the avian sarcoma virus (ASV) gene product responsible for the transformation of fibroblasts. TLCK has been shown to induce the phenotypic reversion of ASV-transformed cells to normal ( Weber, 1975 Weber M.J. Inhibition of protease activity in cultures of Rous sarcoma virus-transformed cells: effect on the transformed phenotype. Cell. 1975; 5: 253-261 Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (42) Google Scholar ). Kinase activity was measured in extracts of chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF) transformed by the Schmidt-Ruppin strain of ASV (SR-ASV) with antiserum from rabbits bearing ASV-induced tumors. The immunoprecipitates were incubated with γ-32P-ATP under conditions in which the phosphorylation of the IgG heavy chain in the immunoprecipitate was directly proportional to the concentration of cell extract. When ASV-transformed CEF were treated with 0.1 mM TLCK, the kinase activity was reduced by 60% after 2 hr and by 80% after 6 hr, and continued to remain low for up to 40 hr when TLCK was present. When TLCK was removed, the kinase activity rose slowly over a period of many hours, suggesting that the enzyme is irreversibly inactivated by TLCK and new enzyme must be synthesized. The effect of TLCK in vivo is concentration-dependent and specific. Other serine protease inhibitors had no effect on kinase activity. At low concentrations (0.03 mM), TPCK produced partial inhibition (≤20%), but at higher concentrations TPCK was extremely toxic to the cells and therefore could not be tested. The inhibition by TLCK was not due to its ability to inhibit protein synthesis since cycloheximide treatment (1 μg/ml) did not significantly reduce kinase activity. TLCK also inhibited kinase activity when added directly to cell extracts, but about 5 times higher concentrations of TLCK were required to produce 50% inhibition. Under these conditions both TLCK and TPCK were comparable inhibitors, whereas PMSF had no effect. Our finding that the inhibition of the kinase by TLCK in vivo parallels the reversion of cell morphology to normal suggests that the kinase has an important role in transformation and offers a biochemical rationale for treatment of tumors with this agent."
https://openalex.org/W189649489,"Abstract The effects of adrenalectomy on glucagon activation of liver glycogen phosphorylase and glycogenolysis were studied in isolated hepatocytes. Adrenalectomy resulted in reduced responsiveness of glycogenolysis and phosphorylase to glucagon activation. Stimulation of cAMP accumulation and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity by glucagon was unaltered in cells from adrenalectomized rats. Adrenalectomy did not alter the proportion of type I and type II protein kinase isozymes in liver, whereas this was changed by fasting. Activation of phosphorylase kinase by glucagon was reduced in hepatocytes from adrenalectomized rats, although the half-maximal effective concentration of glucagon was unchanged. No difference in phosphorylase phosphatase activity between liver cells from control and adrenalectomized rats was detected. Glucagon-activated phosphorylase declined rapidly in hepatocytes from adrenalectomized rats, whereas the time course of cAMP increase in response to glucagon was normal. Addition of glucose (15 mM) rapidly inactivated glucagon-stimulated phosphorylase in both adrenalectomized and control rat hepatocytes. The inactivation by glucose was reversed by increasing glucagon concentration in cells from control rats, but was accelerated in cells from adrenalectomized rats. It is concluded that impaired activation of phosphorylase kinase contributes to the reduced glucagon stimulation of hepatic glycogenolysis in adrenalectomized rats. The possible role of changes in phosphorylase phosphatase is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1515576480,"Long chain fatty acyl coenzyme A ligase (E.C.6.2.1.3) has been solubilized from isolated rat liver mitochondria using the nonionic detergent, Brij 58, at a final concentration of 2%. The enzyme has been purified by chromatography on Sephadex G-200, precipitation with ammonium sulfate, and chromatography on Sepharose 4B, hydroxyapatite, carboxymethyl-Sephadex, and blue dextran-Sephadex G-200. The monomer form of the undissociated enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of 250,000. This monomer aggregates readily in the absence of detergent. Analysis of the enzyme using 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gels results in the appearance of four protein components having molecular weights of 135,000, 115,000, 65,000, and 55,000. This is in contrast to the microsomal long chain fatty acyl-CoA ligase which has an apparent molecular weight of 168,000 consisting of six identical subunits. The purified mitochondrial enzyme has a specific activity of 270 nmol of palmitoyl-CoA formed/min/mg of protein. This represents a 70-fold purification compared to intact mitochondria with a 30.8% yield of total ligase activity. In the course of the reaction, there is a 1:1:1 stoichiometric relationship between the conversion of palmitate to palmitoyl-CoA, the conversion of ATP to AMP, and the oxidation of the sulfhydryl group of free coenzyme A. Electrophoretic analysis of the purified enzyme using 3% to 25% polyacrylamide gradient gels reveals a single major protein component. Analysis of this protein component using 7 .5% SDS polyacrylamide gels after recovery from preparative polyacrylamide gels reveals a protein banding pattern identical with that of purified enzyme obtained from blue dextran-Sephadex G-200. In addition, the enzyme elutes from blue dextran-Sephadex G-200 in a symmetrical peak having a constant specific activity throughout. Based on these data, the final enzyme preparation is judged to be highly purified long chain fatty acylCoA ligase from rat liver mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W136115573,"During the lag period before H2 is evolved by the nitrogenase system, the EPR signal of dinitrogenase decreases steadily, indicating transfer of electrons into dinitrogenase. The rate constant for the decrease in amplitude of the EPR signal, the steady state rate of H2 evolution from nitrogenase, and the length of the lag period have been measured. The data suggest that H2 is evolved only after dinitrogenase has been reduced by 2 electrons/molybdenum. The electrons that have been transfered into dinitrogenase during the lag period are not evolved as H2 upon denaturation of dinitrogenase. The existence of a lag indicates that the two nitrogenase proteins dissociate after every electron transfer. The lag occurs and the nitrogenase proteins dissociate under a variety of conditions of pH and temperature."

https://openalex.org/W1507851566,"Chicken liver xanthine dehydrogenase, like other xanthine-oxidizing enzymes, is a dimer of Mr = 150,000 subunits. Each subunit contains one molybdenum, one FAD, and two distinct Fe2S2 centers. Treatment with a number of proteases shows that the native enzyme subunit is cleaved at three distinct sites. However, the cleavage products can be separated only under denaturing conditions. Prolonged treatment with subtilisin at pH 10.1 has permitted the isolation of an Mr = 65,000 catalytically active fragment that is devoid of FAD but which contains the molybdenum and both types of iron-sulfur center. A model of the domain structure of the native enzyme is proposed."

https://openalex.org/W1598834574,"The reduction of the melilotate hydroxylase . 2-OH-phenyl propionate complex by NADH and reduced 3-acetyl pyridine adenine dinucleotide (AcPyNADH) has been investigated using steady state kinetic and rapid reaction techniques. Reduction by NADH appeared to involve only one charge-transfer-type intermediate (between reduced enzyme and NAD) as previously described (Strickland, S., and Massey, V. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 2953-2962). Reduction by AcPyNADH was shown to involve two charge-transfer-type intermediates. The first was between oxidized enzyme and AcPyNADH and the second was between reduced enzyme and AcPyNAD. Reaction of AcPyNADH with oxidized enzyme . 2-OH-phenyl propionate complex to form the first charge-transfer complex reached equilibrium within the mixing time of the stopped flow apparatus (5 ms). Subsequent steps in the reaction appeared to be first order and were independent of the AcPyNADH concentration. An 8-fold deuterium isotope effect on the step involving flavin reduction was found when reduced 3-acetyl[4A-2H]pyridine adenine dinucleotide (AcPyNADD) was used as the reductant. Analysis of the rapid reaction results for the reaction of oxidized pyridine nucleotide with reduced enzyme . 2-OH-phenyl propionate complex indicated the presence of two forms of reduced enzyme (in equilibrium) of which only one form was capable of reacting with the oxidized pyridine nucleotide. Based on the rapid reaction data, a mechanism for the reduction half-reaction is proposed. The turnover number calculated from this mechanism is in good agreement with that determined from the steady state data."
https://openalex.org/W1567182159,"Rat hepatocytes have been studied in suspension culture for 10-h periods. Levels of extractable lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) have been measured in these hepatocytes at hourly intervals in order to note the balance between biosynthesis and degradation of this enzyme. Newly synthesized LDH has been measured by following the rate of incorporation of [3H]leucine into radiochemically pure LDH of high specific catalytic activity as isolated by a rapid affinity chromatographic procedure. The effects of the addition of physiological concentrations of the following hormones at the beginning of 10-h culture periods immediately following preparation of the hepatocytes by the collagen perfusion procedure have been recorded. The hormones triiodothyronine (T3), insulin, glucagon, and dexamethasone have been added singly or in combination. The culture medium has supplied variable amounts of these hormones in the 10% of fetal calf (or other) serum added, and the hepatocytes themselves have provided intracellular amounts of hormones. In addition to the added hormones, N6,O2'-dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) has also been studied. Control suspensions of hepatocytes show reproducible initial levels of extractable LDH which are maintained or slightly increased during 10 h. Such control systems also incorporate [3H]leucine into total protein and into highly purified LDH at reproducible rates during 10 h of incubation. The effects of added hormones on LDH lavels are as follows: (a) T3 causes about a 2-fold increase in LDH at 7 to 8 h in hepatocytes from young adult animals, an effect which is lowered in either younger or older animals or in thyroidectomized animals. (b) Insulin leads to a similar increase in LDH at 5 to 6 h and a falling off at 8 to 10 h. (c) Glucagon also causes an approximate doubling of the amount of extractable LDH during a 10-doubling of the amount of extractable LDH during a 10-h period. (d) Dexamethasone does not produce an increase. (e) Bt2-cAMP produces an effect indistinguishable from that of glucagon. Paired combinations of these hormones fail to produce an additive response in any case. The combinations of T3 plus dexamethaseon and insulin plus dexamethasone lead to significant reductions in levels of extractable LDH when compared to the single hormone effects cited above. With respect to rates of synthesis of total protein as measured by [3H]leucine incorporation, only glucagon, glucagon plus Bt2-cAMP, glucagon plus insulin, T3 plus Bt2cAMP, and T3 plus insulin produce significant increases during a 10-h period. However, when [3H]leucine incorporation into highly purified LDH is measured as an index of LDH biosynthesis, T3, insulin, and glucagon consistently increase the biosynthetic rates during a 10-h period. Bt2cAMP produces a smaller increase. Dexamethasone fails to produce any significant change when compared to controls. Paired combinations of hormones again do not produce any additive effect on LDH biosynthesis when the hormone producing the higher level is taken as the reference..."
