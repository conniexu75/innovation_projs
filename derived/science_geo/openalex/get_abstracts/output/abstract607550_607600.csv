https://openalex.org/W2790166049,"Lies spread faster than the truth There is worldwide concern over false news and the possibility that it can influence political, economic, and social well-being. To understand how false news spreads, Vosoughi et al. used a data set of rumor cascades on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. About 126,000 rumors were spread by ∼3 million people. False news reached more people than the truth; the top 1% of false news cascades diffused to between 1000 and 100,000 people, whereas the truth rarely diffused to more than 1000 people. Falsehood also diffused faster than the truth. The degree of novelty and the emotional reactions of recipients may be responsible for the differences observed. Science , this issue p. 1146"

https://openalex.org/W2789495752,"The gut microbiota benefits humans via short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production from carbohydrate fermentation, and deficiency in SCFA production is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We conducted a randomized clinical study of specifically designed isoenergetic diets, together with fecal shotgun metagenomics, to show that a select group of SCFA-producing strains was promoted by dietary fibers and that most other potential producers were either diminished or unchanged in patients with T2DM. When the fiber-promoted SCFA producers were present in greater diversity and abundance, participants had better improvement in hemoglobin A1c levels, partly via increased glucagon-like peptide-1 production. Promotion of these positive responders diminished producers of metabolically detrimental compounds such as indole and hydrogen sulfide. Targeted restoration of these SCFA producers may present a novel ecological approach for managing T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W2794778778,"Machine Learning (ML) methods have been proposed in the academic literature as alternatives to statistical ones for time series forecasting. Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions."

Manfredo Vieira et al. identified a gut microbe, Enterococcus gallinarum , that translocates from the gut into the organs of mice with a genetic predisposition to lupus-like autoimmunity (see the Perspective by Citi). Molecular signatures of gut barrier disintegration and pathogenic T helper cells were evident in the gut, liver, and lymphoid organs during colonization with the pathobiont. The ensuing pathology could be reversed by vancomycin treatment and by vaccination against E. gallinarum . The same bug was also found in liver biopsies of autoimmune patients, but not in healthy controls. Science , this issue p. 1156 ; see also p. 1097"

As the climate warms, westerly winds in the Southern Hemisphere will strengthen and shift poleward, surface waters will warm, and sea ice will disappear. Moore et al. suggest that one effect of these changes will be a dramatic decrease in marine biological productivity (see the Perspective by Laufkötter and Gruber). This decrease will result from a global-scale redistribution of nutrients, with a net transfer to the deep ocean. By 2300, this could drive declines in fisheries yields by more than 20% globally and by nearly 60% in the North Atlantic. Science , this issue p. 1139 ; see also p. 1103"

We show that ice-VII occurs as inclusions in natural diamond and serves as an indicator for such water-rich regions. Ice-VII, the residue of aqueous fluid present during growth of diamond, crystallizes upon ascent of the host diamonds but remains at pressures as high as 24 gigapascals; it is now recognized as a mineral by the International Mineralogical Association. In particular, ice-VII in diamonds points toward fluid-rich locations in the upper transition zone and around the 660-kilometer boundary."

https://openalex.org/W2792582506,"Grid cells are neurons active in multiple fields arranged in a hexagonal lattice and are thought to represent the ""universal metric for space."" However, they become nonhomogeneously distorted in polarized enclosures, which challenges this view. We found that local changes to the configuration of the enclosure induce individual grid fields to shift in a manner inversely related to their distance from the reconfigured boundary. The grid remained primarily anchored to the unchanged stable walls and showed a nonuniform rescaling. Shifts in simultaneously recorded colocalized grid fields were strongly correlated, which suggests that the readout of the animal's position might still be intact. Similar field shifts were also observed in place and boundary cells-albeit of greater magnitude and more pronounced closer to the reconfigured boundary-which suggests that there is no simple one-to-one relationship between these three different cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2790861287,"The faithful inheritance of the epigenome is critical for cells to maintain gene expression programs and cellular identity across cell divisions. We mapped strand-specific DNA methylation after replication forks and show maintenance of the vast majority of the DNA methylome within 20 minutes of replication and inheritance of some hemimethylated CpG dinucleotides (hemiCpGs). Mapping the nascent DNA methylome targeted by each of the three DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) reveals interactions between DNMTs and substrate daughter cytosines en route to maintenance methylation or hemimethylation. Finally, we show the inheritance of hemiCpGs at short regions flanking CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)/cohesin binding sites in pluripotent cells. Elimination of hemimethylation causes reduced frequency of chromatin interactions emanating from these sites, suggesting a role for hemimethylation as a stable epigenetic mark regulating CTCF-mediated chromatin interactions."

Here, we show that CLOCK is a novel AKT substrate in vitro and in cells, and this phosphorylation site is a negative regulator of CLOCK nuclear localization by acting as a binding site for 14-3-3 proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2795222640,"The relationships between anhedonia and suicidal ideation or suicide attempts were explored in a large sample of physicians using the interpersonal psychological theory of suicide. We tested two hypotheses: firstly, that there is a significant relationship between anhedonia and suicidality and, secondly, that anhedonia could mediate the relationships between suicidal ideation or suicide attempts and thwarted belongingness or perceived burdensomeness.In a cross-sectional study, 557 physicians filled out several questionnaires measuring suicide risk, depression, using the abridged version of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-13), and demographic and job-related information. Ratings of anhedonia, perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness were then extracted from the BDI-13 and the other questionnaires.Significant relationships were found between anhedonia and suicidal ideation or suicide attempts, even when significant variables or covariates were taken into account and, in particular, depressive symptoms. Mediation analyses showed significant partial or complete mediations, where anhedonia mediated the relationships between suicidal ideation (lifetime or recent) and perceived burdensomeness or thwarted belongingness. For suicide attempts, complete mediation was found only between anhedonia and thwarted belongingness. When the different components of anhedonia were taken into account, dissatisfaction-not the loss of interest or work inhibition-had significant relationships with suicidal ideation, whereas work inhibition had significant relationships with suicide attempts.Anhedonia and its component of dissatisfaction could be a risk factor for suicidal ideation and could mediate the relationship between suicidal ideation and perceived burdensomeness or thwarted belongingness in physicians. Dissatisfaction, in particular in the workplace, may be explored as a strong predictor of suicidal ideation in physicians."

Explore their associated risks of adverse maternal and perinatal outcome, including risk of recurrence in a subsequent pregnancy. To provide population based gestational age and sex and parity specific reference ranges for cord length. Design Population based registry study. Setting Medical Birth Registry of Norway 1999–2013. Population All singleton births (gestational age>22weeks<45 weeks) (n = 856 300). Methods Descriptive statistics and odds ratios of risk factors for extreme cord length and adverse outcomes based on logistic regression adjusted for confounders. Main outcome measures Short or long cord (<10th or >90th percentile), cord knot and entanglement, adverse pregnancy outcomes including perinatal and intrauterine death. Results Increasing parity, maternal height and body mass index, and diabetes were associated with increased risk of a long cord. Large placental and birth weight, and fetal male sex were factors for a long cord, which again was associated with a doubled risk of intrauterine and perinatal death, and increased risk of adverse neonatal outcome. Anomalous cord insertion, female sex, and a small placenta were associated with a short cord, which was associated with increased risk of fetal malformations, placental complications, caesarean delivery, non-cephalic presentation, perinatal and intrauterine death. At term, cord knot was associated with a quadrupled risk of perinatal death. The combination of a cord knot and entanglement had a more than additive effect to the association to perinatal death. There was a more than doubled risk of recurrence of a long or short cord, knot and entanglement in a subsequent pregnancy of the same woman. Conclusion Cord length is influenced both by maternal and fetal factors, and there is increased risk of recurrence. Extreme cord length, entanglement and cord knot are associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes including perinatal death. We provide population based reference ranges for umbilical cord length."
https://openalex.org/W2795146667,"Interleukin-17 (IL-17), a cytokine mainly secreted by Th17 cells, seems to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Functional genetic polymorphisms in IL-17 and its receptor genes can influence either qualitatively or quantitatively their functions. Therefore, we aimed to study the impact of IL17-A and IL17RC polymorphisms on plasma level of IL-17 and RA susceptibility and severity.In this context, IL-17A*rs2275913 and IL-17RC*rs708567 polymorphisms were investigated together with the quantification of IL17 plasma level in 115 RA patients and 91 healthy control subjects matched in age, sex and ethnic origin.There were no statistically significant associations between IL-17A and IL-17RC studied polymorphisms and RA susceptibility. In contrast, IL-17A plasma levels were significantly higher in patients (55.07 pg/ml) comparatively to controls (4.75 pg/ml), p<10E-12. A ROC curve was used to evaluate the performance of plasma IL-17 in detecting RA. Given 100% specificity, the highest sensitivity of plasma IL-17A was 61.7% at a cut-off value of 18.25 pg/ml; p < 10E-21, CI = [0.849-0.939]. Analytic results showed that the IgM-rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies were significantly less frequent in patients with the IL-17RC*A/A genotype than those carrying *G/G and *G/A genotypes; p = 0.013 and p = 0.015, respectively. Otherwise, IL-17 plasma levels' analysis showed a significant association with the activity of RA (DAS28≥5.1 = 74.71 pg/ml vs. DAS28<5.1 = 11.96 pg/ml), p<10E-6.IL-17A*rs2275913 (G/A) and IL-17RC*rs708567 (G/A) polymorphisms did not seem to influence RA susceptibility in Tunisian population. This result agrees with those reported previously. Plasma IL-17A level seems to be predictive of severe RA occurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2794895499,"There is a general lack of understanding about how communities of bacteria respond to exogenous toxins such as antibiotics. Most of our understanding of community-level stress responses comes from the study of stationary biofilm communities. Although several community behaviors and production of specific biomolecules affecting biofilm development and associated behavior have been described for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other bacteria, we have little appreciation for the production and dispersal of secreted metabolites within the 2D and 3D spaces they occupy as they colonize, spread, and grow on surfaces. Here we specifically studied the phenotypic responses and spatial variability of alkyl quinolones, including the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) and members of the alkyl hydroxyquinoline (AQNO) subclass, in P. aeruginosa plate-assay swarming communities. We found that PQS production was not a universal signaling response to antibiotics, as tobramycin elicited an alkyl quinolone response, whereas carbenicillin did not. We also found that PQS and AQNO profiles in response to tobramycin were markedly distinct and influenced these swarms on different spatial scales. At some tobramycin exposures, P. aeruginosa swarms produced alkyl quinolones in the range of 150 μm PQS and 400 μm AQNO that accumulated as aggregates. Our collective findings show that the distribution of alkyl quinolones can vary by several orders of magnitude within the same swarming community. More notably, our results suggest that multiple intercellular signals acting on different spatial scales can be triggered by one common cue."
https://openalex.org/W2795133115,"Ageing is associated with grey matter atrophy and changes in task-related neural activations. This study investigated the effects of age and education on neural activation during a spatial working memory task in 189 participants aged between 20–80 years old, whilst controlling for grey matter density. Age was related to linear decreases in neural activation in task activated areas, and this effect was no longer significant when adjusting for education or accuracy. Age was also related to cubic increases in neural activation in non-task related areas, such as the temporal gyrus, cuneus and cerebellum when adjusting for accuracy and education. These findings support previous lifespan datasets indicating linear age-related decreases in task activation, but non-linear increases in non-task related areas during episodic memory tasks. The findings also support past studies indicating education offers a form of cognitive reserve through providing a form of neural compensation and highlights the need to consider education in ageing studies."

Recently, we found that the transcription factor Zic family member 2 (ZIC2) is highly expressed in liver TICs and required for their self-renewal. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying self-renewal of liver TICs remain unclear. Here, using expression profiling and CRISPR-interference assays with clinical samples of human liver cancers, we identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), lncZic2, that is located near the ZIC2 locus and was highly expressed in liver cancer and liver TICs. We found that lncZic2 is required for the self-renewal of liver TICs in a ZIC2-independent manner. lncZic2 drove the expression of myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) and MARCKS-like 1 (MARCKSL1), whose expression levels were increased during liver tumorigenesis and liver TIC self-renewal. Mechanistically, lncZic2 interacted with BRM/SWI2-related gene 1 (BRG1) and recruited this transcriptional regulator to the promoters of the MARCKS and MARCKSL1 gene, which activated expression of these genes. Moreover, we noted that depletion of lncZic2 and BRG1 decreases MARCKS and MARCKSL1 expression and diminishes liver TIC levels. In conclusion, lncZic2 is required for the self-renewal of liver TICs by up-regulating MARCKS and MARCKSL1 gene expression via the transcription factor BRG1. Our findings suggest that the lncZic2–BRG1–MARCKS/MARCKSL1 signaling cascade might be a potential target for eliminating liver TICs in the management of liver cancer.

In 2015 all preschoolers were approached and the presence of a chronic health condition was assessed by parental questionnaires and preschool health examination data. The identification of a chronic health condition was based on special health care needs and presence of a doctor's diagnosis out of 24 school-relevant diseases. At the end of the first school year, overall school performance was assessed by teachers and rated on a 5-item scale ranging from -10 to +10.Of 3683 children approached, 2003 were enrolled. Overall school performance was available for 1462 children (51% boys). Of these, 52% suffered from a chronic health condition. Compared to children without a chronic health condition, children with special health care needs (15%) performed worse at school (adjusted mean difference: -0.95, 95% CI: [-1.55; -0.35], P = 0.002). Children with a doctor's diagnosis but without special health care needs (37%) did not perform worse at school. The effect was further analysed considering the extent of special health care needed.Chronic health conditions affect overall school performance early in primary school.

Moreover, the integrin very late antigen (VLA)-1 is highly expressed on subtypes of CLL that are associated with high proliferation rates in the lymph node context. We herein identify a critical role for ZAP70 in chemokine-mediated, inside-out signaling to integrins in trisomy 12 carrying Ohio State University-CLL cell lines derived from a patient with previously treated CLL. We found that ZAP70-positive CLL cells migrated significantly better toward ligands of the lymph node homing chemokine receptors CCR7 and CXCR4 compared with ZAP70-negative cells. In addition, ZAP70-expressing CLL cells adhered more efficiently to integrin ligands under static conditions. We discovered that ZAP70 expression controls chemokine-driven clustering of the integrins VLA-4 and lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1. More precisely, chemokine stimulation resulted in a ZAP70-dependent integrin valency regulation on CLL cells, whereas high-affinity regulation of integrins was independent of ZAP70. Consequently, ZAP70-expressing CLL cells show increased chemokine-driven arrest on immobilized integrin ligands and on chemokine-presenting endothelial cells under physiologic flow conditions. Hence, we describe a novel mechanism showing how ZAP70 controls chemokine-driven valency regulation of integrins and arrest of CLL cells on endothelial cells, a process that might contribute to CLL disease progression.-Laufer, J.

https://openalex.org/W2794610027,"Objective To determine the factors associated with gait parameters in female patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods The gait analysis was performed in a large cohort of RA patients, and three basic gait parameters (step length, cadence and gait speed) were calculated. Clinical and laboratory data were also collected. Factors associated with gait parameters were analyzed using multivariable linear regression in the three models with forced entry. Then, we divided those patients with Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ) scores ≤ 0.5 into two groups according to their gait speed that were compared to identify the characteristics of patients with a good HAQ score but poor walking ability. Results A total of 318 female patients were analyzed. Knee extension strength had the strongest positive association with all three gait parameters (P < 0.0001), while methotrexate use was also positively associated with all three gait parameters (step length: P < 0.05, cadence: P < 0.05 in model 1 and 2; P < 0.01 in model 3, gait speed: P < 0.01). The disease activity score was negatively associated with step length and gait speed (step length, gait speed: P < 0.01 in model 1 and 2; P < 0.05 in model 3). 26% of patients with good HAQ scores showed slow gait speed. Patients with good HAQ scores and slow gait speed had higher disease activity scores (P < 0.05) and lower knee extension strength (P < 0.0001) than those with good HAQ scores and normal gait speed. Conclusions High knee extension strength, low disease activity and administration of methotrexate were strongly associated with good walking ability in female patients with RA. And, even if patients showed good HAQ scores, about quarter of those patients had poor walking ability, and they showed higher disease activity, lower knee extension strength, compared to the patients with normal gait speed."
https://openalex.org/W2794848326,"Nucleosome dynamics, such as spontaneous DNA unwrapping, are postulated to have a critical role in regulating the access of DNA repair machinery to DNA lesions within nucleosomes. However, the specific histone domains that regulate nucleosome dynamics and the impact of such changes in intrinsic nucleosome dynamics on DNA repair are not well understood. Previous studies identified a highly conserved region in the N-terminal tail of histone H2B known as the histone H2B repression (or HBR) domain, which has a significant influence on gene expression, chromatin assembly, and DNA damage formation and repair. However, the molecular mechanism(s) that may account for these observations are limited. In this study, we characterized the stability and dynamics of ΔHBR mutant nucleosome core particles (NCPs) in vitro by restriction enzyme accessibility (REA), FRET, and temperature-induced sliding of histone octamers. Our results indicate that ΔHBR–NCPs are more dynamic, with a larger steady-state fraction of the NCP population occupying the unwrapped state than for WT-NCPs. Additionally, ΔHBR-histone octamers are more susceptible to temperature-induced sliding on DNA than WT histone octamers. Furthermore, we show that the activity of base excision repair enzymes at uracil lesions and single nucleotide gaps is enhanced in a site-specific manner in ΔHBR–NCPs. This enhanced activity correlates well with regions exhibiting increased DNA unwrapping. Finally, removal of the HBR domain is not sufficient to completely alleviate the structural constraints imposed by histone octamers on the activity of base excision repair enzymes. Nucleosome dynamics, such as spontaneous DNA unwrapping, are postulated to have a critical role in regulating the access of DNA repair machinery to DNA lesions within nucleosomes. However, the specific histone domains that regulate nucleosome dynamics and the impact of such changes in intrinsic nucleosome dynamics on DNA repair are not well understood. Previous studies identified a highly conserved region in the N-terminal tail of histone H2B known as the histone H2B repression (or HBR) domain, which has a significant influence on gene expression, chromatin assembly, and DNA damage formation and repair. However, the molecular mechanism(s) that may account for these observations are limited. In this study, we characterized the stability and dynamics of ΔHBR mutant nucleosome core particles (NCPs) in vitro by restriction enzyme accessibility (REA), FRET, and temperature-induced sliding of histone octamers. Our results indicate that ΔHBR–NCPs are more dynamic, with a larger steady-state fraction of the NCP population occupying the unwrapped state than for WT-NCPs. Additionally, ΔHBR-histone octamers are more susceptible to temperature-induced sliding on DNA than WT histone octamers. Furthermore, we show that the activity of base excision repair enzymes at uracil lesions and single nucleotide gaps is enhanced in a site-specific manner in ΔHBR–NCPs. This enhanced activity correlates well with regions exhibiting increased DNA unwrapping. Finally, removal of the HBR domain is not sufficient to completely alleviate the structural constraints imposed by histone octamers on the activity of base excision repair enzymes. Eukaryotic DNA is organized into arrays of nucleosomes, which constitute the primary level of chromatin compaction.

DNA-templated processes, including DNA repair, are dependent on protein–DNA interactions that are restricted by the histone proteins in nucleosomes (2Guintini L. Charton R. Peyresaubes F. Thoma F. Conconi A. Nucleosome positioning, nucleotide excision repair and photoreactivation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2015; 36 (26429065): 98-10410.1016/j.dnarep.2015.09.012Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 3Rodriguez Y.

Additionally, the DNA trajectory is significantly different when bound to the histone octamer compared with that in solution (4McGinty R.K. Tan S. Nucleosome structure and function.Chem. Rev. 2015; 115 (25495456): 2255-227310.1021/cr500373hCrossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). These differences arise from periodic sharp deformations in the DNA structure at 14 local minima where the minor groove of DNA interacts with histone residues, such as “sprocket” arginines (5Hodges A.J. Gallegos I.J. Laughery M.F. Meas R. Tran L. Wyrick J.J. Histone sprocket arginine residues are important for gene expression, DNA repair, and cell viability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2015; 200 (25971662): 795-80610.1534/genetics.115.175885Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although these contacts can be made with most DNA sequences of sufficient length, efficient bending at the histone octamer surface is facilitated by sequence-specific dinucleotide steps (6Chua E.Y. Vasudevan D. Davey G.E. Wu B. Davey C.A.

NCP stability and dynamics is also dependent on histone content. Structural and biochemical evidence suggests that amino acid sequence variability in histone proteins, such as that found in histone variants, can regulate nucleosome dynamics, either alone or in conjunction with histone post-translational modification (PTM) (7Bao Y.

For example, H3K56 acetylation has been shown to increase nucleosomal DNA unwrapping dynamics by ∼7-fold relative to unacetylated nucleosomes, based on FRET studies of in vitro reconstituted NCPs (10Neumann H.

Even subtle changes in nucleosome dynamics can have important biological implications in DNA-templated processes.

The impact of nucleosomes and nucleosome dynamics on repair is best understood for the base excision repair (BER) pathway. BER is responsible for removing chemically aberrant DNA bases, abasic sites generated from enzymatic or spontaneous hydrolytic reactions, and single-strand breaks. In a coordinated stepwise fashion, damage-specific DNA glycosylases identify and remove damaged DNA bases, cleaving the N-glycosidic bond between the sugar and the base (14Bauer N.C. Corbett A.H. Doetsch P.W. The current state of eukaryotic DNA base damage and repair.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 (26519467): 10083-10101PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting abasic site is the substrate for endonuclease APE1, which cleaves the DNA backbone 5′ to the abasic site, generating a single nucleotide gap with 5′-deoxyribose phosphate and 3′-OH termini. DNA polymerase β (Pol β) removes the blocking 5′-deoxyribose phosphate intermediate, generating a 5′-phosphate, and performs template-directed DNA synthesis using the 3′-OH (15Hitomi K. Iwai S.

Repair is completed with the assistance of DNA ligases that seal the nick.

Unlike the N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4 that are highly conserved, the sequence of the N-terminal tails of H2A and H2B are more divergent across species, and less is known about their functional roles in nucleosome stability and dynamics.

The HBR domain in yeast consists of residues 30–37 in the N-terminal tail of H2B, corresponding to residues 24–31 of Xenopus laevis H2B. In X. laevis, seven of the eight residues are positively charged amino acids, arginine or lysine, which make potentially important electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged DNA backbone of both DNA gyres (29Luger K. Richmond T.J. The histone tails of the nucleosome.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8 (9610403): 140-14610.1016/S0959-437X(98)80134-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Because of the importance of electrostatic interactions between DNA and histones in regulating NCP stability and dynamics, it was originally postulated that the HBR domain may play an important role in stabilizing octamer positioning and regulating intranucleosomal interactions (28Nag R. Kyriss M. Smerdon J.W. Wyrick J.J. Smerdon M.J. A cassette of N-terminal amino acids of histone H2B are required for efficient cell survival, DNA repair and Swi/Snf binding in UV irradiated yeast.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38 (20007597): 1450-146010.1093/nar/gkp1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30Sivolob A.

In addition, some of the HBR phenotypes may also be due to the role of the HBR domain in regulating the binding of H2A/H2B dimers to histone chaperones FACT and Nap1 (31Mao P. Kyriss M.N. Hodges A.J. Duan M. Morris R.T. Lavine M.D. Topping T.B. Gloss L.M. Wyrick J.J. A basic domain in the histone H2B N-terminal tail is important for nucleosome assembly by FACT.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (27369377): 9142-9152PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is unclear to what extent the HBR domain regulates intrinsic nucleosome stability and dynamics, nor is it known whether differences in nucleosome stability and dynamics contribute to HBR mutant phenotypes, such as DNA damage sensitivity and repair. To shed light on these past results, our present report uses biochemical and biophysical assays to address site-specific features of nucleosome dynamics caused by HBR deletion and their impact on BER enzyme activity. To better understand the role of the HBR domain in regulating nucleosome stability and dynamics during BER, we characterized the stability of NCPs containing the HBR deletion (ΔHBR–NCPs) and examined its effect on specific repair steps associated with removal of rotationally and translationally positioned uracil and single nucleotide DNA gaps. Restriction enzyme accessibility (REA) assays indicate that ΔHBR–NCPs are intrinsically more dynamic in regions 13–23 bp from the DNA exit/entry sites (i.e. at the sites of REA cleavage). Analysis of nucleosome dynamics by FRET of unmodified (WT) and ΔHBR–NCPs are in agreement with these studies, showing a decreased energy transfer in ΔHBR–NCPs relative to WT, which is indicative of enhanced DNA unwrapping in ΔHBR–NCPs. Furthermore, heat-induced translational repositioning (or sliding) assays show that ΔHBR–NCPs are more prone to thermally induced sliding, suggesting a weakening of histone–DNA interactions. The increased dynamics of ΔHBR–NCPs were associated with increased uracil DNA gycosylase (UDG) and APE1 activity at an inwardly oriented uracil lesion located 24 bp from the DNA ends, while showing no enhanced activity at a more centrally located uracil lesion. The activity of Pol β was similarly dependent on the location of a DNA gap in NCPs relative to the HBR domain. Taken together, our results suggest that the HBR domain restricts DNA accessibility to BER repair enzymes in a site-specific manner, which correlates with the proximity of DNA lesions to the HBR domain in nucleosomes. However, deletion of the HBR domain does not completely overcome the steric constraints imposed on BER repair proteins by nucleosomes, particularly near the dyad center of NCPs. To determine the effects of HBR deletion (ΔHBR, residues 24–31 in X. laevis) on nucleosome formation, nucleosome core particles (NCPs) were reconstituted with WT or ΔHBR X. laevis recombinant histone octamers (Fig. 1, A and B) and the high affinity 601 nucleosome positioning sequence (34Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Preparation of nucleosome core particle from recombinant histones.Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304 (10372352): 3-1910.1016/S0076-6879(99)04003-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 36Lowary P.T.

Biol. 1998; 276 (9514715): 19-4210.1006/jmbi.1997.1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). The HBR domain is the most conserved region in the H2B N-terminal tail (Fig. 1A) and is comprised of 6–7 basic amino acids that, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are critical for transcriptional repression of a large set of genes (27Parra M.A. Kerr D. Fahy D. Pouchnik D.J. Wyrick J.J. Deciphering the roles of the histone H2B N-terminal domain in genome-wide transcription.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26 (16648479): 3842-385210.1128/MCB.26.10.3842-3852.2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1C, removal of these residues in histone H2B does not impede nucleosome formation, although the ΔHBR–NCP migrates slightly faster on native polyacrylamide gels, in accordance with a previous study (39Zheng S. Crickard J.B. Srikanth A. Reese J.C. A highly conserved region within H2B is important for FACT to act on nucleosomes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2014; 34 (24248595): 303-31410.1128/MCB.00478-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). ΔHBR histone octamers generate well positioned NCPs as indicated by the presence of a single band on these gels. Furthermore, hydroxyl radical footprinting shows no detectable changes in the •OH cleavage pattern in WT and ΔHBR–NCPs (Fig. S1). These data suggest that 601 DNA adopts, on average, the same translational and rotational positioning on WT and ΔHBR histone octamers. HaeIII and MspI restriction sites are more accessible in ΔHBR–NCPs. To investigate possible changes in the structure or dynamics of ΔHBR–NCPs, we first tested the effect of HBR deletion on REA. Fig. 2A shows (schematically) the locations of MspI and HaeIII restriction cut sites relative to the dyad center of NCPs. As shown, the MspI and HaeIII restriction sites are located 13 and 23 nucleotides (nt), respectively, from the DNA end (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, ΔHBR–NCPs are cleaved much more efficiently by MspI compared with WT NCPs, regardless of whether the DNA template contains uracil at position −21, relative to the dyad axis toward the 3′ end, in the J chain of the 601 NCP (Fig. 2B, right panel) or position +4 located in the complementary I chain 4 nt from the dyad axis toward the 5′ end (Fig. 2C). Additionally, the HaeIII restriction site, located closer to the dyad center, is also more accessible in ΔHBR–NCPs (Fig. 2B, left panel). These results indicate that ΔHBR–NCP DNA is intrinsically more accessible to restriction enzyme cleavage in regions as far as 23 bp from the DNA ends. The REA results suggest that the HBR domain plays a role in regulating nucleosomal DNA accessibility and/or dynamics, particularly in regions near the DNA entry/exit sites. Therefore, FRET was employed to compare the DNA unwrapping dynamics between WT and ΔHBR nucleosomes. For these experiments, the 601 DNA template was labeled with a pair of fluorescent dyes, Cy3 and Cy5, and reconstituted with WT or ΔHBR histone octamers. We chose three different locations in the nucleosome structure to incorporate the dye pair (Fig. 3A): (1) near the nucleosome’s entry/exit sites (End-label) (37Shim Y. Duan M.R. Chen X. Smerdon M.J.

Importantly, we observe less energy transfer in the ΔHBR–NCP when the dye pair is located toward the edge (end label) or near the HBR-binding domain (HBR label; Fig. 3, B and D, compare red and blue traces). In contrast, no reduction in energy transfer is seen in the HBR nucleosome when the dye pair is located near the dyad center (Fig. 3F). These results, which are consistent with our REA data, indicate that ΔHBR nucleosomes have increased DNA unwrapping dynamics for DNA regions near the DNA entry/exit sites but not at a centrally located site near the nucleosome dyad. Nucleosome stability was examined using salt-induced dissociation of NCPs (11Duan M.R. Smerdon M.J. UV damage in DNA promotes nucleosome unwrapping.J. Biol.

As expected, the FRET efficiency decreases with increased salt concentration in both WT and ΔHBR nucleosomes (Fig. 3, C, E, and G). For end-label nucleosomes, the FRET efficiency of HBR–NCPs decreases more rapidly with increased salt concentration compared with WT, indicating that histone–DNA interactions near the DNA ends are weaker and more easily disrupted by salt (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, for HBR-label nucleosomes, the ΔHBR–NCP is more sensitive than WT at low to moderate salt concentrations (i.e. 0.3 and 0.4 m) and slightly less sensitive at higher salt concentrations (Fig. 3E). This later result may indicate that the H2A-H2B dimer, which dissociates from NCPs at lower salt concentrations (40Gansen A. Valeri A. Hauger F. Felekyan S. Kalinin S. Tóth K. Langowski J.

Finally, no difference is observed between WT and ΔHBR–NCP salt dissociation with internal-label nucleosomes (Fig. 3G), indicating no change in the slow unwrapping kinetics of DNA near the dyad center of NCPs. Taken together, these results indicate that deletion of the HBR domain in histone H2B generates more dynamic NCPs in which DNA near the nucleosome edges has increased unwrapping kinetics relative to WT NCPs. It has long been known that nucleosomes are mobile on DNA at higher temperatures in vitro, where histone octamers are able to slide translationally along the DNA over large distances (42Pennings S.

https://openalex.org/W2794771343,"Background Inequalities in health among groups of various socio-economic status (as measured by education, occupation, and income) constitute one of the main challenges for public health. Since 2006, the Lazio Regional Outcome Evaluation Program (P.Re.Val.E.), presents a set of indicators of hospital performance based on quality standards driven by strong clinical recommendations, and measures the variation in the access to effective health care for different population groups and providers in the Lazio Region. One of the aims of the program was to compare population subgroups in order to promote equity in service provision. Since June 2013, a new management strategy has been put in place that assigned specific goals based on performance assessment to the chief executive officers of the hospitals. Aim To evaluate whether, in recent years, there has been a reduction in the differential access to effective health care, among individuals with different educational levels. Methods We enrolled all patients discharged from both public and private hospitals of the Lazio region between 2012 and 2015, living in Lazio region. We analysed the proportion of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with percutaneous coronary intervention within 90 minutes (primary PCI), the proportion of patients with hip fracture (HF) who underwent surgery within 2 days, and the proportion of women with primary C-section. We applied multivariate logistic regression models to assess the effect of educational level on health outcomes, adjusting for demographic characteristics and comorbidities that could affect the outcomes. For each year of the study period, we compared adjusted proportions of outcomes for the highest and the lowest level of education by using percentage differences. Results In the Lazio region, 44.6% of STEMI patients (N = 3,299) were treated with primary PCI, 54.4% of patients with hip fractures (N = 6,602) underwent surgery within 2 days, and 27.7% of women without a previous C-section (N = 34,718) delivered via C-section, in 2015. The corresponding proportions in 2012 were 27.8%, 31.3% and 31.5%, respectively. By comparing the adjusted proportions in patients with the highest education level (a university degree or higher) to those with the lowest level education level (None/Primary school), a decrease in the percentage difference was observed during the study period. In STEMI and delivery cohorts, the improvement of outcomes involved the least and the most educated patients, respectively, and the difference between the two educational levels was close to zero in 2015, whereas for hip patients, the improvement was more evident among the less educated patients. Conclusions In the Lazio region, we observed a reduction in the differential access to effective heath care by educational level, in different clinical areas. Different factors might explain these results. On top of the public disclosure of outcome data, the management strategy applied in mid-2013 might have driven the overall improvement of the health system for the considered conditions, helping to achieve a fairer access to health."

We have recently shown that two adjacent negatively charged residues Asp-180 and Asp-181 in the S1S2 loop in the repeat I of CaV1.2 are required to recapitulate the complex characteristics of the CaVα2δ1-induced modulation of CaV1.2 currents (19Bourdin B.

Whereas Asp-180 confers the voltage-dependent shift in channel activation, CaV1.2 Asp-181 anchors the physical interaction with CaVα2δ1, a necessary step to exert its function. Based on the recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the homologous CaV1.1 channel complex (CaVα1S with auxiliary subunits) (16Wu J. Yan Z. Li Z. Qian X. Lu S. Dong M. Zhou Q. Yan N.

Within the VWA domain of CaVα2δ1 lies a so-called “perfect” MIDAS motif with the typical Asp-Xaa-Ser-Xaa-Asp signature (20Dolphin A.C. The α2δ subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1828 (23196350): 1541-154910.1016/j.bbamem.2012.11.019Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1A, a single divalent cation is coordinated by the multiple oxygen atoms contributed by the clockwise arrangement of Asp-259, Asp-363, Ser-263, Ser-261, and Thr-331 (rat numbering). In the model, CaVα2δ1 Ser-261 and Ser-263 are predicted to be within sufficient distance of CaV1.2 Asp-181 to form a salt bridge and anchor the proteins’ interface. Herein, we aimed to identify the molecular determinants in CaVα2δ1 responsible for the protein and functional interaction with CaV1.2, using a multipronged experimental strategy combining site-directed mutagenesis, coimmunoprecipitation assays, patch-clamp experiments, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We are currently reporting that mutating simultaneously the N-terminal residues Asp-259, Ser-261, and Ser-263 to the hydrophobic alanine residues within the MIDAS motif prevented the expression of CaVα2δ1 at the cell surface and consequently the increase of Ca2+ currents through CaV1.2. Single-point mutations D259A and S261A impaired the ability of CaVα2δ1 to coimmunoprecipitate with CaV1.2 and failed to up-regulate the channel activity. Using MD simulations, we propose that the side chain at position Asp-259 and the oxygen atom of the side chain of Ser-261 in CaVα2δ1 foster the folding of the MIDAS site by clasping the divalent cation within its binding site. In turn, this conformation is essential for promoting the optimal electrostatic interaction between CaV1.2 Asp-181 and the hydrogen atoms of the hydroxyl groups of CaVα2δ1 Ser-261 and Ser-263. We recently identified the negatively charged Asp-181 in the first extracellular loop of CaV1.2 as an essential determinant for the interaction with the extracellular CaVα2δ1 protein (19Bourdin B. Briot J. Tétreault M.P. Sauvé R. Parent L. Negatively charged residues in the first extracellular loop of the L-type CaV1.2 channel anchor the interaction with the CaVα2δ1 auxiliary subunit.J. Biol.

To identify the molecular determinants of the interface, we have produced a 3D model of the IS1S4 region using the molecular coordinates of the cryo-EM structure of the homologous CaV1.1 channel complex (PDB code 5GJV) (16Wu J. Yan Z. Li Z. Qian X. Lu S. Dong M. Zhou Q. Yan N. Structure of the voltage-gated calcium channel Ca(v)1.1 at 3.6 A resolution.Nature. 2016; 537 (27580036): 191-19610.1038/nature19321Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The sequence identity between IS1S4 in CaV1.1 and CaV1.2 is 69.6%, whereas VWA is perfectly conserved. Nonetheless, the molecular coordinates of the IS3S4 loop were not reported in the cryo-EM structure and were reconstructed using Modeler (see details in “Experimental procedures”). The 3D model was selected using a DOPE score of −37032 (between −37,100 and −35,578) and a molpdf score of 2147 (between 2144 and 3085). MD simulations suggest that Gly-262 and/or Ser-263 in the VWA domain of CaVα2δ1 were the most likely residues to interact with Asp-181 in the first extracellular loop of CaV1.2. Along with Asp-259, Ser-261, Thr-331, and Asp-363, Ser-263 is one of the five polar residues that form a perfect MIDAS motif in the rat isoform of CaVα2δ1 (Fig. 1A). X-ray crystallography structures of integrin proteins position a single Mg2+ enclosed within MIDAS residues, although Ca2+, Zn2+, or Mn2+ could also occupy the binding site (21San Sebastian E. Mercero J.M. Stote R.H. Dejaegere A. Cossío F.P. Lopez X. On the affinity regulation of the metal-ion-dependent adhesion sites in integrins.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128 (16536528): 3554-356310.1021/ja054142aCrossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Ca2+ and Mg2+ are both plausible candidates to occupy the MIDAS at the CaVα2δ1–CaV1.2 interface given that the concentration of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions is roughly equivalent (in the millimolar range) in the extracellular medium of eukaryotic cells. We chose to perform the MD simulations in the presence of a Ca2+ ion, mostly because the ion was included in the coordinates of the published cryo-EM structure (16Wu J. Yan Z. Li Z. Qian X. Lu S. Dong M. Zhou Q. Yan N. Structure of the voltage-gated calcium channel Ca(v)1.1 at 3.6 A resolution.Nature. 2016; 537 (27580036): 191-19610.1038/nature19321Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ ion was virtually inserted in the geometric center of the motif, and its average position was adjusted by MD simulations. MD simulations were carried out after the transmembrane helices of CaV1.2 (membrane protein) were embedded in a model dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) lipid bilayer containing 128 DPPC molecules (Fig. 1B). The hydrophobic tails of the lipid molecules in the plasma membrane appear to stabilize hydrophobic residues Ala-253, Leu-254, Gly-255, and Gly-256 of the IS3S4 region within the plasma membrane. The protein–membrane system was solvated with water in the presence of 143 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2. This 3D model reached a steady state after 1.1 ns equilibration with r.m.s.d. variations around 4.5 Å for simulations up to 25 ns, and this observation stood for three distinct trajectories. As seen, the negatively charged side chain of CaV1.2 Asp-181 is predicted in this model to face the hydrogen atoms from the hydroxyl groups of Ser-261 at a distances of 1.7 Å thus suggesting a key role for CaVα2δ1 Ser-261 in enabling the interaction with CaV1.2. Coimmunoprecipitation assays were carried out to explore the contribution of MIDAS residues in promoting the interaction between CaV1.2 and CaVα2δ1. The importance of the polar side chains was examined after substitution with the hydrophobic alanine residue at multiple MIDAS positions with CaVα2δ1 D259A/S261A/S263A (DSS/A), D259A/S261A/S263A/T331A (DSST/A), and D259A/S261A/S263A/D363A (DSSD/A). Assays were performed with untagged CaV1.2, mCherry-CaVα2δ1-HA, and CaVβ3–c-Myc using anti-c-Myc–coated beads to bait the channel complex. For conciseness, the mCherry-CaVα2δ1-HA construct will hereafter be referred to as CaVα2δ1-HA. Under this protocol, CaVβ3–c-Myc binds to the magnetic beads and pulls down the CaV1.2–CaVα2δ1 complex (Fig. 2A). As seen in Fig. 2B, input lane, CaV1.2, CaVα2δ1-HA WT and mutants, and CaVβ3 proteins were translated at the expected molecular masses of 250, 175, and 60 kDa, respectively, after recombinant expression in HEKT cells. CaVβ3–c-Myc was captured by the beads under all experimental conditions, and CaV1.2 successfully pulled down CaVα2δ1 WT (Fig. 2C). The ablation of the negative or polar side chain in the MIDAS residues prevented the coimmunoprecipitation of any of the multiple mutants in CaVα2δ1, even after a 200-s exposure.

Fluorescence intensity of the anti-HA tag antibody conjugated to FITC measured in intact nonpermeabilized cells provides an estimation of the cell-surface expression of the construct, whereas the fluorescence intensity measured after cell permeabilization is used as a marker of total protein expression. As seen, multiple mutations of the MIDAS residues significantly reduced the cell-surface expression of mCherry-CaVα2δ1-HA to ≈10% for the mutants (Fig. 2E). More importantly, multiple mutations were also seen to reduce the protein stability with a sharp decrease in the relative fluorescence for FITC measured in permeabilized cells (Table 1). This observation is in agreement with previous reports showing that coexpression of CaVα2δ1 increases the total protein stability of CaVβ3-bound CaV1.2 proteins, and conversely coexpression of CaV1.2 increases the total protein stability of CaVα2δ1 in the presence of CaVβ3 (22Bourdin B.

Altogether, these results indicate that the polar or negatively charged side chains of the MIDAS residues contribute to the stability of CaVα2δ1, its cell-surface expression, and its interaction with the pore-forming subunit of CaV1.2.Table 1Cell-surface expression of CaVα2δ1CaV1.2 + CaVβ3Relative ΔMedFI (%) FITC-conjugated anti-HACell surface, intact cellsTotal, permeabilized cells+ mCherry-CaVα2δ1-HA WT92 ± 3 (12)97 ± 0.9 (12)D259A/S261A/S263A10 ± 0.05 (3)**36 ± 0.3 (3)**D259A/S261A/S263A/D363A6 ± 0.09 (3)**31 ± 0.3 (3)**D259A/S261A/S263A/T331A11 ± 0.1 (3)**33 ± 0.5 (3)**D259A55 ± 4 (3)**81 ± 3 (3)**D259R20 ± 0.8 (3)**73 ± 1 (3)**V260A77 ± 7 (3)*99 ± 1 (3)V260R48 ± 3 (3)**97 ± 1 (3)S261A36 ± 2 (3)**72 ± 2 (3)**S261R39 ± 0.1 (3)**66 ± 1 (3)**G262A110 ± 8 (3)*95 ± 4 (3)G262R92 ± 0.5 (3)87 ± 2 (3)**S263A97 ± 4 (3)94 ± 0.3 (3)S263R105 ± 2 (3)*86 ± 0.7 (3)**T331A133 ± 5 (3)**106 ± 2 (3)*T331G103 ± 7 (3)98 ± 2 (3)T331R108 ± 8 (3)88 ± 2 (3)**D363A113 ± 9 (3)89 ± 1 (3)*D363G92 ± 5 (3)85 ± 1 (3)**D363R43 ± 3 (3)**66 ± 1 (3)** Open table in a new tab Individual contributions from the side chains of MIDAS amino acids were analyzed after substitutions to the positively charged arginine (Figure 3, Figure 4) and to the neutral alanine residue (Figure 5, Figure 6). This two-step strategy was meant to exclude residues that would remain functional following nonconserved substitutions predicted to alter the local electrical field. MIDAS residues as well as the intervening Val-260 and Gly-262 residues were sequentially mutated. All mCherry-CaVα2δ1-HA single mutants expressed the mCherry tag and were trafficked at the plasma membrane (Table 1). Coimmunoprecipitation assays were carried out with c-Myc–coated beads to bait the channel complex. As seen in Fig. 3A, input lane, CaV1.2, CaVα2δ1-HA WT and mutants, and CaVβ3 proteins were translated at the expected molecular masses of 250, 175, and 60 kDa, respectively, after recombinant expression in HEKT cells. CaVβ3 was captured by the beads under all experimental conditions, and CaV1.2 successfully pulled down CaVα2δ1-HA WT (Fig. 3B). Not too surprisingly, the mutation to an arginine residue significantly impaired the ability for most CaVα2δ1 mutants, save for V260R, to interact with CaV1.2. Longer exposure times allowed us to detect a small interaction with CaVα2δ1-HA G262R and CaVα2δ1-HA S263R, but no interaction was ever detected with CaVα2δ1-HA D259R and CaVα2δ1-HA S261R. A separate series of experiments demonstrated that protein interaction was also somewhat conserved with CaVα2δ1-HA T331R and CaVα2δ1-HA D363R in a fashion reminiscent of CaVα2δ1-HA G262R and CaVα2δ1-HA S263R (data not shown). These results indicate that the side chain at position Val-260 is not directly involved in protein interaction, whereas the side chains at Asp-259 and Ser-261 play a critical role in this process. Examination of the 3D model concurs that the main-chain atoms of Val-260 are facing the Ca2+ ion and that side-chain substitution does not alter that preferred configuration.Figure 4CaVα2δ1 V260R stimulates CaV1.2 whole-cell currents.

https://openalex.org/W2791861998,"The budding discipline of quantum acoustics could shake up embryonic quantum computers. Such machines run by flipping quantum bits, or qubits, that can be set not only to zero or one, but, bizarrely, to zero and one at the same time. The most advanced qubits are circuits made of superconducting metal, and to control or read out a qubit, researchers make it interact with a microwave resonator—typically a strip of metal on the qubit chip or a finger-size cavity surrounding it—which rings with microwave photons like an organ pipe rings with sound. But some physicists see advantages to replacing the microwave resonator with a mechanical one that rings with quantized vibrations, or phonons. A well-designed acoustic resonator could ring longer than a microwave one does and could be far smaller, enabling researchers to produce more compact technologies. But first scientists must gain quantum control over vibrations. And several groups are on the cusp of doing that, as they reported at a recent meeting."

The United States is considered to be free of the disease although sporadic outbreaks have occurred over the last few decades that were thought to be associated with the importation of horses. The objective of this study was to create finished, reference quality genomes that characterize the diversity of Taylorella equigenitalis isolates introduced into the USA, and identify their differences. Five isolates of T. equigenitalis associated with introductions into the USA from unique sources were sequenced using both short and long read chemistries allowing for complete assembly and annotation. These sequences were compared to previously published genomes as well as the short read sequences of the 200 isolates in the National Veterinary Services Laboratories' diagnostic repository to identify unique regions and genes, potential virulence factors, and characterize diversity. The 5 genomes varied in size by up to 100,000 base pairs, but averaged 1.68 megabases. The majority of that diversity in size can be explained by repeat regions and 4 main regions of difference, which ranged in size from 15,000 to 45,000 base pairs. The first region of difference contained mostly hypothetical proteins, the second contained the CRISPR, the third contained primarily hemagglutinin proteins, and the fourth contained primarily segments of a type IV secretion system. As expected and previously reported, little evidence of recombination was found within these genomes. Several additional areas of interest were also observed including a mechanism for streptomycin resistance and other virulence factors. A SNP distance comparison of the T. equigenitalis isolates and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) showed that relatively, T. equigenitalis was a more diverse species than the entirety of MTBC."
https://openalex.org/W2794911941,"The HIV type 1 pathogenicity factor Nef enhances viral replication by modulating multiple host cell pathways, including tuning the activation state of infected CD4 T lymphocytes to optimize virus spread. For this, Nef inhibits anterograde transport of the Src family kinase (SFK) Lck toward the plasma membrane (PM). This leads to retargeting of the kinase to the trans-Golgi network, whereas the intracellular transport of a related SFK, Fyn, is unaffected by Nef. The 18-amino acid Src homology 4 (SH4) domain membrane anchor of Lck is necessary and sufficient for Nef-mediated retargeting, but other details of this process are not known. The goal of this study was therefore to identify characteristics of SH4 domains responsive to Nef and the transport machinery used. Screening a panel of SFK SH4 domains revealed two groups that were sensitive or insensitive for trans-Golgi network retargeting by Nef as well as the importance of the amino acid at position 8 for determining Nef sensitivity. Anterograde transport of Nef-sensitive domains was characterized by slower delivery to the PM and initial targeting to Golgi membranes, where transport was arrested in the presence of Nef. For Nef-sensitive SH4 domains, ectopic expression of the lipoprotein binding chaperone Unc119a or the GTPase Arl3 or reduction of their endogenous expression phenocopied the effect of Nef. Together, these results suggest that, analogous to K-Ras, Nef-sensitive SH4 domains are transported to the PM by a cycle of solubilization and membrane insertion and that intrinsic properties define SH4 domains as cargo of this Nef-sensitive lipoprotein binding chaperone-GTPase transport cycle."
