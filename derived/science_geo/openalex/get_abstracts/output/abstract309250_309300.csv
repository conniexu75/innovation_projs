https://openalex.org/W2026576777,"The mass spectrum of xenon from spontaneous fission in a laboratory sample of plutonium-244 is precisely what meteoriticists predicted it would be; this discovery completes a web of proof that this nuclide is a bona fide extinct radioactivity of galactic origin, that r-process nucleosynthesis was ongoing in the galaxy at the time of the birth of the sun, and that the early meteoritic abundances of plutonium-244, heretofore tentative, can be utilized with confidence in models for the chronology of galactic nucleosynthesis. The search for an explanation for anomalous fission-like xenon in carbonaceous chondrites can now be narrowed."

https://openalex.org/W2030881827,"A detailed record of a field reversal has been obtained from the natural remanent magnetization of the Tatoosh intrusion in Mount Rainier National Park, Washington. The reversal took place at 14.7 +/- 1 million years and is interpreted to be from reverse to normal. A decrease in the intensity of the field of about an order of magnitude occurs immediately before the reversal, while its orientation remains substantially unchanged. The onset of the reversal is marked by abrupt swinging of the virtual geomagnetic pole along an arc of a great circle. During the reversal the pole traces a path across the Pacific. In the last stage of the process recorded in the sections, the succession of virtual geomagnetic poles is very similar to those generated by secular variation in the recent past. Although the cooling rate of the intrusion is not sufficiently well known to permit a useful calculation of the duration of the reversal process, an estimate based on the length of the supposed secular variation cycles gives 1 to 4 x 103 years for the reversal of field direction and approximately 1 x 104 years for the time scale of the intensity changes."

From 1963 to the Hekla (Iceland) event in May 1970, two latitudinal belts of volcanoes have ejected ash and gases into the stratosphere. One belt is equatorial and the other is just below the Arctic Circle. The latter, where the tropopause is considerably lower, may have been the principal source of replenishment of volcanic dust and gases to the stratosphere. Submarine and phreatic volcanic eruptions may have been the sources of reported increase of water vapor in the stratosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2041772049,"During the late glacial and postglacial the productivity of Berry Pond in Berkshire County, Massachusetts, underwent a number of significant oscillations. This is suggested by data on sedimentary chlorophyll degradation products, diatoms, and Cladocera. The productivity changes were. apparently controlled by changes in weathering, terrestrial vegetation in the watershed, litter production, and runoff. There are associated changes in cladoceran community structure."
https://openalex.org/W2027284324,"Tracks of fission fragments from a californium-252 source have been revealed by graft copolymerization. A 15 percent solution of propenoic (acrylic) acid monomer was reacted with irradiated cellulose triacetate for 24 hours at 55 degrees C. Copolymer forms preferentially at the track sites and it can be dyed with rhodamine B because of its acid and hydrophylic properties. After the dyeing, the tracks were seen by using fluorescence microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2053934214,"Gas chromatographic and mass spectrometric analyses on selected lipid fractions revealed for the first time the presence of ethyl esters of long-chain fatty acids as biological products. Ethyl esters of oleic, palmitic, and stearic acids were detected in relative concentrations of 21.2, 2.4, and 1.5 percent, respectively, of the total methyl and ethyl ester fraction. Both saturated and unsaturated ethyl esters contain pronounced mass spectral fragments at a mass-to-charge ratio of 88."
https://openalex.org/W2049119961,"A new gibberellin, GA(32), purified from Prunus seed, has three interesting properties: (i) it is the most polar of the 34 gibberellins presently known, (ii) it is the most potent of all gibberellins tested in the barley endosperm bioassay, and (iii) it is very active in promoting the growth of unpollinated apricot ovaries with a normal ratio of length to diameter."
https://openalex.org/W2094256116,Review of the first results obtained from the development and use of a new type of differential receiver designed to determine the relative locations on the lunar surface of two Apollo-deposited transmitters. This receiver has made it possible to reduce random and systematic instrumental errors to nearly negligible levels (displacement uncertainties equivalent to a few centimeters).

https://openalex.org/W2084197523,"Species of Pacific shallow-water fish are more tolerant of low temperatures than Atlantic species are. At high temperatures Atlantic species are more tolerant than Pacific species. For species pairs of Bathygobius differences in the tolerance of low temperatures are small and can be removed by acclimation to 23 degrees C. Differences in the tolerance to low temperature in transisthmian species of Apogon, however, are large and persist after acclimation to 23 degrees C. Some Pacific species adapt to the cooler temperatures of their habitat through increasing their rates of oxygen consumption at ambient temperatures or decreasing the dependence of oxygen uptake rate on temperature, or both."

https://openalex.org/W2082637565,"Oil may be removed from a body of water by dispersing over the oil layer fiberized paper of a specific fragment size. The fiberized paper sorbs or collects greater than 27 times its weight and is capable of holding the oil on the water surface as an oil-fibrous paper matrix or agglomerate for extensive periods so that it can be easily skimmed and recovered. Oil can be expressed from the oilpaper mass, and the paper mass can be refiberized and reused repeatedly to sorb or collect additional oil. Fiberized paper is more oleophilic than hydrophilic."
