https://openalex.org/W4293242723,"The Perseverance rover landed in Jezero crater, Mars, to investigate ancient lake and river deposits. We report observations of the crater floor, below the crater's sedimentary delta, finding that the floor consists of igneous rocks altered by water. The lowest exposed unit, informally named Séítah, is a coarsely crystalline olivine-rich rock, which accumulated at the base of a magma body. Magnesium-iron carbonates along grain boundaries indicate reactions with carbon dioxide-rich water under water-poor conditions. Overlying Séítah is a unit informally named Máaz, which we interpret as lava flows or the chemical complement to Séítah in a layered igneous body. Voids in these rocks contain sulfates and perchlorates, likely introduced by later near-surface brine evaporation. Core samples of these rocks have been stored aboard Perseverance for potential return to Earth."
https://openalex.org/W4293511136,"Arrays of optically trapped nanoparticles have emerged as a promising platform for the study of complex non-equilibrium phenomena. Analogous to atomic many-body systems, one of the crucial ingredients is the ability to precisely control the interactions between particles. However, the optical interactions studied thus far only provide conservative optical binding forces of limited tunability. Here we demonstrate a coupling mechanism that is orders of magnitude stronger and has new qualitative features. These effects arise from the previously unexplored phase coherence between the optical fields that drive the light-induced dipole-dipole interaction. In addition, polarization control allows us to observe electrostatic coupling between charged particles in the array. Our results pave the way for a fully programmable many-body system of interacting nanoparticles with tunable dissipative and nonreciprocal interactions, which are instrumental for exploring entanglement and topological phases in arrays of levitated nanoparticles."
https://openalex.org/W4293242863,"The granular dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is an evolutionary specialization of primates that is centrally involved in cognition. We assessed more than 600,000 single-nucleus transcriptomes from adult human, chimpanzee, macaque, and marmoset dlPFC. Although most cell subtypes defined transcriptomically are conserved, we detected several that exist only in a subset of species as well as substantial species-specific molecular differences across homologous neuronal, glial, and non-neural subtypes. The latter are exemplified by human-specific switching between expression of the neuropeptide somatostatin and tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine production in certain interneurons. The above molecular differences are also illustrated by expression of the neuropsychiatric risk gene FOXP2 , which is human-specific in microglia and primate-specific in layer 4 granular neurons. We generated a comprehensive survey of the dlPFC cellular repertoire and its shared and divergent features in anthropoid primates."
https://openalex.org/W4293243162,"Filter capacitors play a critical role in ensuring the quality and reliability of electrical and electronic equipment. Aluminum electrolytic capacitors are the most commonly used but are the largest filtering components, limiting device miniaturization. The high areal and volumetric capacitance of electric double-layer capacitors should make them ideal miniaturized filter capacitors, but they are hindered by their slow frequency responses. We report the development of interconnected and structurally integrated carbon tube grid–based electric double-layer capacitors with high areal capacitance and rapid frequency response. These capacitors exhibit excellent line filtering of 120-hertz voltage signal and volumetric advantages under low-voltage operations for digital circuits, portable electronics, and electrical appliances. These findings provide a sound technological basis for developing electric double-layer capacitors for miniaturizing filter and power devices."
https://openalex.org/W4293242926,"Lysosomes coordinate cellular metabolism and growth upon sensing of essential nutrients, including cholesterol. Through bioinformatic analysis of lysosomal proteomes, we identified lysosomal cholesterol signaling (LYCHOS, previously annotated as G protein–coupled receptor 155), a multidomain transmembrane protein that enables cholesterol-dependent activation of the master growth regulator, the protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Cholesterol bound to the amino-terminal permease-like region of LYCHOS, and mutating this site impaired mTORC1 activation. At high cholesterol concentrations, LYCHOS bound to the GATOR1 complex, a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)–activating protein for the Rag GTPases, through a conserved cytoplasm-facing loop. By sequestering GATOR1, LYCHOS promotes cholesterol- and Rag-dependent recruitment of mTORC1 to lysosomes. Thus, LYCHOS functions in a lysosomal pathway for cholesterol sensing and couples cholesterol concentrations to mTORC1-dependent anabolic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4293242877,"Since the discovery of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the nature of the eye movements that characterize this sleep phase has remained elusive. Do they reveal gaze shifts in the virtual environment of dreams or simply reflect random brainstem activity? We harnessed the head direction (HD) system of the mouse thalamus, a neuronal population whose activity reports, in awake mice, their actual HD as they explore their environment and, in sleeping mice, their virtual HD. We discovered that the direction and amplitude of rapid eye movements during REM sleep reveal the direction and amplitude of the ongoing changes in virtual HD. Thus, rapid eye movements disclose gaze shifts in the virtual world of REM sleep, thereby providing a window into the cognitive processes of the sleeping brain."
https://openalex.org/W4293243120,"Food webs influence ecosystem diversity and functioning. Contemporary defaunation has reduced food web complexity, but simplification caused by past defaunation is difficult to reconstruct given the sparse paleorecord of predator-prey interactions. We identified changes to terrestrial mammal food webs globally over the past ~130,000 years using extinct and extant mammal traits, geographic ranges, observed predator-prey interactions, and deep learning models. Food webs underwent steep regional declines in complexity through loss of food web links after the arrival and expansion of human populations. We estimate that defaunation has caused a 53% decline in food web links globally. Although extinctions explain much of this effect, range losses for extant species degraded food webs to a similar extent, highlighting the potential for food web restoration via extant species recovery."
https://openalex.org/W4293243031,"Biomaterials display microstructures that are geometrically irregular and functionally efficient. Understanding the role of irregularity in determining material properties offers a new path to engineer materials with superior functionalities, such as imperfection insensitivity, enhanced impact absorption, and stress redirection. We uncover fundamental, probabilistic structure–property relationships using a growth-inspired program that evokes the formation of stochastic architectures in natural systems. This virtual growth program imposes a set of local rules on a limited number of basic elements. It generates materials that exhibit a large variation in functional properties starting from very limited initial resources, which echoes the diversity of biological systems. We identify basic rules to control mechanical properties by independently varying the microstructure’s topology and geometry in a general, graph-based representation of irregular materials."
https://openalex.org/W4293243123,"Chromosome engineering has been attempted successfully in yeast but remains challenging in higher eukaryotes, including mammals. Here, we report programmed chromosome ligation in mice that resulted in the creation of new karyotypes in the lab. Using haploid embryonic stem cells and gene editing, we fused the two largest mouse chromosomes, chromosomes 1 and 2, and two medium-size chromosomes, chromosomes 4 and 5. Chromatin conformation and stem cell differentiation were minimally affected. However, karyotypes carrying fused chromosomes 1 and 2 resulted in arrested mitosis, polyploidization, and embryonic lethality, whereas a smaller fused chromosome composed of chromosomes 4 and 5 was able to be passed on to homozygous offspring. Our results suggest the feasibility of chromosome-level engineering in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W4293105196,"The human papillomavirus (HPV) is sexually transmitted and infects approximately 75% of sexually active people early in their sexual life. Persistent infection with oncogenic HPV types can lead to malignant conditions such as cervical cancer. In 2006, the World Health Organisation approved the use of an efficacious HPV vaccine for girls aged 9 to 14 to prevent HPV-related conditions. Despite the HPV vaccine being available for about 15 years, dose completion remains as low as 20% in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries implementing the vaccination program compared to 77% in Australia and New Zealand. A fraught of barriers to implementation exist which prevent adequate coverage. Achieving success for HPV vaccination in real-world settings requires strategies to overcome implementation bottlenecks. Therefore, a better understanding and mapping of the implementation strategies used in sub-Saharan Africa to increase HPV vaccination uptake is critical. This review aims to identify implementation strategies to increase HPV vaccination uptake for adolescent girls in sub-Saharan Africa and provide a basis for policy and future research, including systematic reviews to evaluate effective strategies as we accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer.This scoping review will consider studies pertaining to implementation strategies to increase HPV vaccination uptake for adolescent girls in sub-Saharan Africa. Studies targeted at different stakeholders to increase adolescent vaccine uptake will be included. Studies using interventions not fitting the definition of implementation strategies as defined by the refined compilation of implementation strategies from the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change project will be excluded. MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, CINAHL (via EBSCO), Scopus and Google Scholar will be searched. Two independent reviewers will screen titles and abstracts for studies that meet the review's inclusion criteria, and the full text of eligible studies will be reviewed. Data will be extracted from eligible studies using a structured data charting table developed by this team for inclusion by two independent reviewers and presented in a table and graphical form with a narrative summary."
https://openalex.org/W4293102333,"Accurate restoration of joint line height and posterior offset in primary Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) have been shown to be important factors in post-operative range of movement and function. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of joint line and posterior offset restoration in a group of patients that underwent robotic-assisted TKA (raTKA). A matched cohort of patients that underwent a TKA using a conventional jig-based technique was assessed for comparison. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference between groups.This study was a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 120 patients with end-stage knee osteoarthritis that received a TKA using the Navio Surgical System (n = 60), or Conventional manual TKA (n = 60). Procedures were performed between 1 January 2019 and 1 October 2019 at six different centres. Joint line height and posterior offset was measured pre-operatively and post-operatively on calibrated weight bearing plain radiographs of the knee. Two observers performed measurements using validated measuring tools. A BMI and age-matched cohort of patients that underwent TKA using a conventional technique in the same six centres were assessed for comparison. Mean values, standard deviations and confidence intervals are presented for change and absolute change in joint line height and posterior offset. Student's t-test was used to compare the changes between techniques.Patients that underwent robotic-assisted TKA had joint line height and posterior offset restored more accurately than patients undergoing TKA using a conventional technique. Average change from pre-operative measurement in joint line height using raTKA was -0.38mm [95% CI: -0.79 to 0.03] vs 0.91 [0.14 to 1.68] with the conventional technique. Average absolute change in joint line height using raTKA was 1.96mm [1.74 to 2.18] vs 4.00mm [3.68 to 4.32] with the conventional technique. Average change in posterior offset using raTKA was 0.08mm [-0.40 to 0.56] vs 1.64mm [2.47 to 0.81] with the conventional technique. Average absolute change in posterior offset with raTKA was 2.19mm [1.92 to 2.46] vs 4.24mm [3.79 to 4.69] with the conventional technique. There was a significant difference when comparing absolute change in joint line height and posterior offset between groups (p<0.01).Robotic-assisted primary TKA restores the joint line height and posterior offset more accurately than conventional jig-based techniques."
https://openalex.org/W4293093194,"Moraxella catarrhalis (M . catarrhalis ) is a gram-negative bacterium, responsible for major respiratory tract and middle ear infection in infants and adults. The recent emergence of the antibiotic resistance M . catarrhalis demands the prioritization of an effective drug target as a top priority. Fortunately, the failure of new drugs and host toxicity associated with traditional drug development approaches can be avoided by using an in silico subtractive genomics approach. In the current study, the advanced in silico genome subtraction approach was applied to identify potential and pathogen-specific drug targets against M . catarrhalis . We applied a series of subtraction methods from the whole genome of pathogen based on certain steps i.e. paralogous protein that have extensive homology with humans, essential, drug like, non-virulent, and resistant proteins. Only 38 potent drug targets were identified in this study. Eventually, one protein was identified as a potential new drug target and forwarded to the structure-based studies i.e. histidine kinase (UniProt ID: D5VAF6). Furthermore, virtual screening of 2000 compounds from the ZINC database was performed against the histidine kinase that resulted in the shortlisting of three compounds as the potential therapeutic candidates based on their binding energies and the properties exhibited using ADMET analysis. The identified protein gives a platform for the discovery of a lead drug candidate that may inhibit it and may help to eradicate the otitis media caused by drug-resistant M . catarrhalis . Nevertheless, the current study helped in creating a pipeline for drug target identification that may assist wet-lab research in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4293104868,"The viral genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), particularly its cell-binding spike protein gene, has undergone rapid evolution during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Variants including Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.2 now seriously threaten the efficacy of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines that target the spike protein. Viral evolution over a much longer timescale has generated a wide range of genetically distinct sarbecoviruses in animal populations, including the pandemic viruses SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1. The genetic diversity and widespread zoonotic potential of this group complicates current attempts to develop drugs in preparation for the next sarbecovirus pandemic. Receptor-based decoy inhibitors can target a wide range of viral strains with a common receptor and may have intrinsic resistance to escape mutant generation and antigenic drift. We previously generated an affinity-matured decoy inhibitor based on the receptor target of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and deployed it in a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector (rAAV) for intranasal delivery and passive prophylaxis against COVID-19. Here, we demonstrate the exceptional binding and neutralizing potency of this ACE2 decoy against SARS-CoV-2 variants including Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.2. Tight decoy binding tracks with human ACE2 binding of viral spike receptor-binding domains across diverse clades of coronaviruses. Furthermore, in a coronavirus that cannot bind human ACE2, a variant that acquired human ACE2 binding was bound by the decoy with nanomolar affinity. Considering these results, we discuss a strategy of decoy-based treatment and passive protection to mitigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future airway virus threats."
https://openalex.org/W4293101475,"This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of early implant placement and functional loading in maxillary sinus floor augmentation (MSFA) using recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2/hydroxyapatite (rhBMP-2/HA) and to compare these outcomes with those of the conventional protocol in MSFA using deproteinized bovine bone (DBB).The rhBMP-2/HA and DBB groups consisted of 14 and 13 patients who underwent MSFA with BMP and DBB, respectively. After placement of 22 implants and 21 implants in the rhBMP-2/HA and DBB groups, respectively, abutment connections were performed 3 months after implant placement for the rhBMP-2/HA group and 6 months after implant placement for the DBB group. Changes in grafted sinus height (GSH), marginal bone loss (MBL), and implant stability were evaluated up to one year after functional loading.Survival rates for the rhBMP-2/HA and DBB groups after one year of functional loading were 90.9% and 90.5%, respectively. Both groups exhibited no significant time-course changes in GSH until one year of functional loading (rhBMP-2/HA, p = 0.124; DBB, p = 0.075). Although significant MBL occurred after one year of functional loading for both groups (rhBMP-2/HA, p < 0.001; DBB, p < 0.001), there were no significant differences in time-course changes in MBL between the two groups (p = 0.450). The mean implant stability quotient values in the rhBMP-2/HA and DBB groups were 75.3 and 75.4 after one year of functional loading, respectively, and there were no significant differences between the two groups (p = 0.557).MSFA using rhBMP-2/HA allowed implant rehabilitation with early implant placement and functional loading and led to a comparable survival rate and implant stability after 1 year of functional loading with acceptable MBL and stable maintenance of GSH compared to the MSFA using DBB with 6 months of healing after implant placement."
https://openalex.org/W4293101555,"Biofilm formation enhances bacteria's ability to colonize unique niches while protecting themselves from environmental stressors. Escherichia coli that colonize the urinary tract can protect themselves from the harsh bladder environment by forming biofilms. These biofilms promote persistence that can lead to chronic and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI). While biofilm formation is frequently studied among urinary E. coli, its association with other pathogenic mechanisms and adaptations in certain host populations remains poorly understood. Here we utilized whole genome sequencing and retrospective medical record analysis to investigate associations between the population structure, phenotypic resistance, resistome, virulome, and patient demographic and clinical findings of 104 unique urinary E. coli and their capacity to form biofilms. We show that population structure including multilocus sequence typing and Clermont phylogrouping had no association with biofilm capacity. Among clinical factors, exposure to multiple antibiotics within that past 30 days and a clinical history of recurrent UTIs were positively associated with biofilm formation. In contrast, phenotypic antimicrobial reduced susceptibility and corresponding acquired resistance genes were negatively associated with biofilm formation. While biofilm formation was associated with increased virulence genes within the cumulative virulome, individual virulence genes did not influence biofilm capacity. We identified unique virulotypes among different strata of biofilm formation and associated the presence of the tosA/R-ibeA gene combination with moderate to strong biofilm formation. Our findings suggest that E. coli causing UTI in dogs utilize a heterogenous mixture of virulence genes to reach a biofilm phenotype, some of which may promote robust biofilm capacity. Antimicrobial use may select for two populations, non-biofilm formers that maintain an arsenal of antimicrobial resistance genes to nullify treatment and a second that forms durable biofilms to avoid therapeutic insults."
https://openalex.org/W4293101588,"Objective The COVID-19 pandemic has badly affected the world with its devastating effects, including Sindh, Pakistan. A massive vaccination campaign against COVID-19 is considered one of the effective ways to curtail the spread of the disease. However, the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine is based on the general population’s knowledge, attitude, perception and willingness for vaccination. Therefore, a survey among the public in Sindh, Pakistan, was done to evaluate their knowledge, attitude, perception and willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccination. Method The online survey was conducted among the residents of Sindh, Pakistan, in July 2021 through a survey tool designed using Google Forms and sent to the population through various social media. Results Of 926 study participants, 59.0% were male, and 68.6% were aged between 18 and 31 years. Higher percentages of responses were recorded from the Hyderabad division (37.5%), and 60.0% of respondents were graduates, with 34.8% of them in the private sector. The results showed that 36.4% of respondents had good knowledge, and 30.3% had a positive attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination. Almost 77% of respondents perceived that everyone should get vaccinated in the country and those health care workers on priority. A majority (80.8%) of respondents were willing to accept COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusion Despite having insufficient knowledge and a low percentage of positive attitude public in Sindh are willing to be vaccinated. Based on this finding, more effort has to be done to promote vaccination among the public, especially among the less educated population."
https://openalex.org/W4293102866,"Immunization stress-related responses presenting as stroke-like symptoms could develop following COVID-19 vaccination. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of immunization stress-related responses causing stroke-like events following COVID-19 vaccination in Thailand.We conducted a retrospective study of the secondary data of reported adverse events after COVID-19 immunization that presented with neurologic manifestations. Between March 1 and July 31, 2021, we collected and analyzed the medical records of 221 patients diagnosed with stroke-like symptoms following immunization. Two majority types of vaccines were used at the beginning of the vaccination campaign, including CoronaVac (Sinovac) or ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca). Demographic and medical data included sex, age, vaccine type, sequence dose, time to event, laboratory data, and recovery status as defined by the modified Rankin score. The affected side was evaluated for associations with the injection site.Overall, 221 patients were diagnosed with immunization stress-related responses (stroke-like symptoms) following CoronaVac (Sinovac) or ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca) vaccinations. Most patients (83.7%) were women. The median (interquartile range) age of onset was 34 (28-42) years in patients receiving CoronaVac and 46 (33.5-60) years in those receiving ChAdOx1. The median interval between vaccination and symptom onset for each vaccine type was 60 (16-960) min and 30 (8.8-750) min, respectively. Sensory symptoms were the most common symptomology. Most patients (68.9%) developed symptoms on the left side of the body; 99.5% of the patients receiving CoronaVac and 100% of those receiving ChAdOx1 had a good outcome (modified Rankin scores ≤2, indicating slight or no disability).Immunization stress-related responses presenting as stroke-like symptoms can develop after COVID-19 vaccination. Symptoms more likely to occur on the injection side are transient (i.e., without permanent pathological deficits). Public education and preparedness are important for administering successful COVID-19 vaccination programs."
https://openalex.org/W4293093130,"Though targeted testing for latent tuberculosis infection (""LTBI"") for persons born in countries with high tuberculosis incidence (""HTBIC"") is recommended in health care settings, this information is not routinely recorded in the electronic health record (""EHR""). We develop and validate a prediction model for birth in a HTBIC using EHR data.In a cohort of patients within Kaiser Permanente Southern California (""KPSC"") and Kaiser Permanent Northern California (""KPNC"") between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2019, KPSC was used as the development dataset and KPNC was used for external validation using logistic regression. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operator curve (""AUCROC"") and area under the precision and recall curve (""AUPRC""). We explored various cut-points to improve screening for LTBI.KPSC had 73% and KPNC had 54% of patients missing country-of-birth information in the EHR, leaving 2,036,400 and 2,880,570 patients with EHR-documented country-of-birth at KPSC and KPNC, respectively. The final model had an AUCROC of 0.85 and 0.87 on internal and external validation datasets, respectively. It had an AUPRC of 0.69 and 0.64 (compared to a baseline HTBIC-birth prevalence of 0.24 at KPSC and 0.19 at KPNC) on internal and external validation datasets, respectively. The cut-points explored resulted in a number needed to screen from 7.1-8.5 persons/positive LTBI diagnosis, compared to 4.2 and 16.8 persons/positive LTBI diagnosis from EHR-documented birth in a HTBIC and current screening criteria, respectively.Using logistic regression with EHR data, we developed a simple yet useful model to predict birth in a HTBIC which decreased the number needed to screen compared to current LTBI screening criteria.Our model improves the ability to screen for LTBI in health care settings based on birth in a HTBIC."
https://openalex.org/W4293103093,"The launch of the selection process for National Development Zones(NDZs) marked a fundamental change in the construction of development zones, making it an essential position for local authorities to implement high-quality development. Based on the data of prefecture-level cities in China from 2000 to 2018, this paper examines the impact and mechanism of selecting NDZs on urban green innovation through a double-difference spatial durbin model using the selection of NDZs as a “quasi-natural experiment”. The study finds that the selection of NDZs can promote green innovation in cities and has a significant window-radiating effect. The heterogeneity test results show that the implementation of the selection policy for development zones in non-old industrial cities, large and medium-sized cities, cities with easy access to transportation, and cities with high market orientation are more likely to promote urban green innovation. At the same time, the higher the level of government governance and the better the level of economic development of the development zones, the more it helps to realize the effects of the selection policy. The results of the mechanism test show that the selection of NDZs has a positive impact on urban green innovation through environmental regulation effects, resource allocation effects, and policy amplification effects."
https://openalex.org/W4293103129,"The purpose of this study was to analyse the biomechanical characteristics of pedicle screws with different placement methods and diameters in the treatment of Tile C1 pelvic fractures by finite element simulation technology and to compare them with the plate fixation model to verify the effectiveness of pedicle screw fixation.A three-dimensional digital model of a normal pelvis was obtained using computed tomography images. A finite element model of a normal pelvis containing major ligaments was built and validated (Model 1). Based on the verified normal pelvis finite element model, a Tile C1 pelvic fracture model was established (Model 2), and then a plate fixation model (Model 3) and a pedicle screw fixation model with different screw placement methods and diameters were established (Models 4-15). For all pelvic fracture fixation models, a vertical load of 500 N was applied on the upper surface of the sacrum to test the displacement and stress distribution of the pelvis in the standing state with both legs.The finite element simulation results showed the maximum displacement of Model 1 and Models 3-15 to be less than 1 mm. The overall maximum displacement of Models 4-15 was slightly larger than that of Model 3 (the maximum difference was 177.91×10-3 mm), but the maximum displacement of iliac bone and internal fixation in Models 4-15 was smaller than that of Model 3. The overall maximum stress (maximum stress of the ilium) and maximum stress of internal fixation in Models 4-15 were less than those in Model 3. The maximum displacement difference and maximum stress difference at the fracture of the pubic ramus between each fixed model were less than 0.01 mm and 1 MPa, respectively. The greater the diameter and number of pedicle screws were, the smaller the maximum displacement and stress of the pelvic fracture models were.The maximum displacement and stress of the pelvic fracture models of the screws placed on the injured side of the pubic region were smaller than the screws on the healthy side.Both the anterior and posterior pelvic rings are fixed with a pedicle screw rod system for treatment of Tile C1 pelvic fractures, which can obtain sufficient biomechanical stability and can be used as a suitable alternative to other implants.The greater the diameter and number of pedicle screws were, the greater the pelvic stability was, and the greater was the stability of the screws placed on the injured side of the pubic region than the screws on the healthy side."
https://openalex.org/W4293103491,"Background Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic liver disease characterized by biliary strictures, cholestasis, and a markedly increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. New markers for the screening and differential diagnosis of PSC are needed. In this pilot study, we have analyzed both the bile and serum proteomic profiles of 80 PSC patients and non-PSC controls (n = 6 for bile and n = 18 for serum). Aim The aim of this study was to discover candidates for new biomarkers for the differential diagnosis of PSC. Methods Bile and serum samples were processed and subsequently analyzed using ultra performance liquid chromatography-ultra definition mass spectrometry (UPLC-UDMS E ). Further analysis included statistical analyses such as receiver operating characteristic curve analysis as well as pathway analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Results and conclusions In bile, we discovered 64 proteins with significantly different levels between the groups, with fold changes of up to 129. In serum, we discovered 112 proteins with significantly different levels. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found multiple proteins with high area under the curve values, up to 0.942, indicating that these serum proteins are of value as new non-invasive classifiers of PSC. Pathway analysis revealed multiple canonical pathways that were enriched in the dataset, which have roles in bile homeostasis and metabolism. We present several serum proteins that could serve as new blood-based markers for the diagnosis of PSC after further validation. The measurement of serum levels of these proteins could be of use in the screening of patients with suspected PSC."
https://openalex.org/W4293104717,"This study aims to provide a national benchmark rate of post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage (PTH) in Australia. Using data from Australia’s National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2020, we have conducted a nation-wide population-based study to estimate a reference rate of PTH. Outcomes of interest included the overall rate and time-trend of PTH, the relationship between PTH rates with age and gender as well as the epidemiology of tonsillectomy procedures. A total of 941,557 tonsillectomy procedures and 15,391 PTH episodes were recorded for the study period. Whilst the incidence of tonsillectomy procedures and the number of day-stay tonsillectomy procedures have increased substantially over time, the overall rate of PTH for all ages has remained relatively constant (1.6% [95% CI: 1.61 to 1.66]) with no significant association observed between the annual rates of PTH and time (year) (Spearman correlation coefficient, R s = 0.24 (95% CI: -0.22 to 0.61), P = 0.3). However, the rate of PTH in adults (aged 15 years and over) experienced a statistically significant mild to moderate upward association with time (year) R s = 0.64 (95% CI: 0.28 to 0.84), P = 0.003. Analysis of the odds of PTH using the risk factors of increasing age and male gender showed a unique age and gender risk pattern for PTH where males aged 20 to 24 years had the highest risk of PTH odds ratio 7.3 (95% CI: 6.7 to 7.8) compared to patients aged 1 to 4 years. Clinicians should be mindful of the greater risk of PTH in male adolescents and young adults. The NHMD datasets can be continually used to evaluate the benchmark PTH rate in Australia and to facilitate tonsillectomy surgical audit activities and quality improvement programs on a national basis."
https://openalex.org/W4293084487,"Background To investigate changes in sociocultural stressors and protective factors, and mental health in Latina mothers before and after the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Methods We examined changes in sociocultural stressors, protective factors, and mental health from two prospective cohorts of Latina mothers from interior and border US cities (Nashville, TN, n = 39 and San Diego, CA, n s range = 78–83; 2013–2020). Results We identified significant longitudinal increases in depression, anxiety, and perceived stress in the border city, and reductions in protective factors (e.g., optimism, social support, and familism) across sites. Discrimination varied by location, and was associated with higher stress only at baseline in the border city, and with higher anxiety in the interior city at follow-up. Acculturative stress was consistently associated with worse mental health across time points in the border city. Various protective factors were associated with reduced stress and anxiety across time points in both cities. Discussion We identified decreased mental health at the border city, and reduced protective factors in Latina mothers across both study sites in the years following the 2016 presidential nomination, during a time of shifting sociopolitical climate. We also identify increased acculturative stress and discrimination over time, particularly at the border city. Interventions to maintain and enhance psychosocial protective factors amongst Latina mothers are warranted."

Little is known about the specific resources required to implement UTT in correctional facilities for incarcerated people. The primary aim of this study was to describe the resources used to implement UTT and to provide detailed costing to inform UTT scale-up in similar settings.The costing study was a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted in three correctional complexes, Johannesburg Correctional Facility in Johannesburg (>4000 inmates) South Africa, and Brandvlei (~3000 inmates), South Africa and Lusaka Central (~1400 inmates), Zambia. Costing was determined through a survey conducted between September and December 2017 that identified materials and labour used for three separate components of UTT: HIV testing services (HTS), ART initiation, and ART maintenance. Our study participants were staff working in the correctional facilities involved in any activity related to UTT implementation. Unit costs were reported as cost per client served while total costs were reported for all clients seen over a 12-month period.The cost of HIV testing services (HTS) per client was $ 92.12 at Brandvlei, $ 73.82 at Johannesburg, and $ 65.15 at Lusaka. The largest cost driver for HIV testing at Brandvlei were staff costs at 55.6% of the total cost, while at Johannesburg (56.5%) and Lusaka (86.6%) supplies were the largest contributor. The cost per client initiated on ART was $917 for Brandvlei, $421.8 for Johannesburg, and $252.1 for Lusaka. The activity cost drivers were adherence counselling at Brandvlei (59%), and at Johannesburg and Lusaka it was the actual ART initiation at 75.6% and 75.8%, respectively. The annual unit cost for ART maintenance was $2,640.6 for Brandvlei, $710 for Johannesburg, and $385.5 for Lusaka. The activity cost drivers for all three facilities were side effect monitoring, and initiation of isoniazid preventive treatment (IPT), cotrimoxazole, and fluconazole, with this comprising 44.7% of the total cost at Brandvlei, 88.9% at Johannesburg, and 50.5% at Lusaka.Given the needs of this population, the opportunity to reach inmates at high risk for HIV, and overall national and global 95-95-95 goals, the UTT policies for incarcerated individuals are of vital importance. Our findings provide comparator costing data and highlight key drivers of UTT cost by facility."

This study presents the development of mountain research between 1900 and 2019 based on peer-reviewed articles in English listed in Web of Science TM (WOS). We analyzed the number of publications over time, journals and scientific categories, frequent topics, and geographical distributions based on 40 mountain ranges and authors’ countries as well as institutional contributions. From 1900–2019, 195k ±10% mountain research papers were published; over 50% from 2010–2019. While papers were published in more than 1000 different journals, indicating a wide range of disciplines engaged in mountain research, 94% of the papers were assigned to “Science &amp; Technology”, only &lt;5% to “Social Sciences” and “Arts &amp; Humanities”. The most papers were written by researchers in the USA, followed by China. The number of papers per area or capita showed high variability across the investigated mountain ranges. Thus, geographically and disciplinarily more balanced research activities and better accessibility of knowledge about mountain regions are recommended."

Methods A total of sixty eight eligible patients with chronic neck pain were randomly allocated to breathing reeducation (BR) group (n = 34) and routine physical therapy (RPT) group (n = 34). Clinical outcomes were neck pain measured through visual analogue score, cervical active range of motion through CROM device, strength of neck muscles through hand held dynamometer and endurance of neck muscles measured through craniocervical flexion test. The neck disability was measured through neck disability index (NDI) and pulmonary outcomes such as forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and FEV1/FVC ratio were measured through Spirolab 4. The outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 4 and at 8 weeks from baseline. Results There were significant improvements in the BR group compared with the RPT group (P = 0.002) for cervical flexion, extension (P = 0.029), endurance (P = 0.042), strength of neck flexors (P &lt;0.001), neck extensors (P = 0.034). Likewise there was a significant change in NDI (P = 0.011), FEV1 (P = 0.045), FVC (P &lt;0.001), and FEV1/FVC ratio (P &lt;0.001) in the BR group compared with the RPT group. The cervical side flexion and rotation showed no significant difference in breathing reeducation group with p &gt; 0.05. Conclusion Breathing reeducation combined with routine physical therapy is an effective treatment in patients with non specific chronic neck pain.

https://openalex.org/W4293102396,"Objective Recreational running is one of the most common physical leisure activities worldwide and is associated with high rates of running related injury (RRI). Little is known of the perceptions of male recreational runners regarding the aetiology and management of RRI. Design Utilising an interpretive phenomenological analysis framework, qualitative data was gathered from participants via interview, and reflexive thematic analysis was used to develop insights into the experiences and perceptions of the participants in relation to RRI. Materials and methods Two focus groups with a total of six (mean age 37.8 ± 9.5 years, 16.5 ± 13.1 years running experience) male recreational runners were used to obtain data regarding their understanding of RRI causation, prevention and management. Interviews were evaluated using a six-phase reflexive thematic analysis approach to generate and interpret themes within the data. Results Three themes (Mind, Body and Education) were identified by the analysis as critical to RRI avoidance. Mind refers to the self-understanding and self-management of personal limits required for RRI prevention. Body reflects a degree of physical conditioning necessary for injury free running, while Education indicates an understanding of how to correctly structure a running program. When viewed together these themes can be seen to form an ‘internal locus of injury’ model which highlights the runners’ beliefs that RRI are related to their decisions regarding training and running, and that avoidance of injury lies within their personal control. Conclusion Recreational runners rely on self-management, in preference to professional advice, to manage training loads, fitness and RRI. Health care professionals involved with this population may consider the use of online resources, a preferred option of runners, to assist runners to build their knowledge base and support their development to experienced runners."
https://openalex.org/W4293102723,"The sympathetic nervous system is highly involved in the regulation of gastrointestinal functions such as luminal alkalinisation and fluid absorption. However, the exact mechanisms are not clear. This study aimed to delineate how α 2 -adrenergic receptor stimulation reduces duodenal luminal alkalinisation and induces net fluid absorption. This was tested by perfusing the duodenum of anesthetized rats with isotonic solutions devoid of Cl - and/or Na + , in the absence and presence of the α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist clonidine. The clonidine was also studied in rats treated with dimethylamiloride (a Na + /H + exchange inhibitor), vasoactive intestinal peptide, and the nicotinic receptor antagonist hexamethonium. Clonidine reduced luminal alkalinisation and induced net fluid absorption. The Cl - -free solution decreased luminal alkalinisation and abolished net fluid absorption, but did not prevent clonidine from doing so. Both the Na + -free solution and luminal dimethylamiloride increased luminal alkalinisation and abolished net fluid absorption, effects counteracted by clonidine. The NaCl-free solution (D-mannitol) did not affect luminal alkalinisation, but reduced net fluid absorption. Clonidine reduced luminal alkalinisation and induced net fluid absorption in rats perfused luminally with mannitol. However, clonidine did not affect the vasoactive intestinal peptide-induced increase in luminal alkalinisation or fluid secretion. Pre-treatment with hexamethonium abolished the effects of clonidine on luminal alkalinisation and net fluid flux. In summary, our in vivo experiments showed that clonidine-induced reduction in luminal alkalinisation and induction of net fluid absorption was unrelated to luminal Na + and Cl - , or to apical Na + /H + or Cl - /HCO 3 - exchangers. Instead, clonidine seems to exert its effects via suppression of nicotinic receptor-activated acetylcholine secretomotor neurons."

There is a severe lack of research evidence regarding the Facebook addiction behavior among university students during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to determine factors associated with Facebook addiction among Bangladeshi university students. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 2,161 Bangladeshi university students during the COVID-19 pandemic from June 2021 to September 2021. A well fitted regression model in R programming language was used for this study. Results Female respondents and those whose family monthly income was &lt;25,000 BDT were more addicted to Facebook than other respondents. Respondents who lost a family member or a relative to COVID-19, engaged in physical activities (exercise) during the pandemic, used Facebook for work purposes or used Facebook to relieve daily stress were more addicted to Facebook. Conclusion Overuse of social media is problematic as it can trigger several mental health symptoms, especially among students. Adequate and effective interventions are required to educate students about the dangers of Facebook addiction and to provide an alternative, healthy options."

Herein, we examined the association of the gap between prescribed vs. achieved patient fluid balance during CRRT (%FBGap) with hospital mortality in critically ill patients.Cohort study of critically ill adults with acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring CRRT and a prescription of negative fluid balance (mean patient fluid balance goal of negative ≥0.5 liters per day). Fluid management parameters included: 1) NUF (net ultrafiltration rate); 2) FBGoal; 3) FBAchieved; and 4) FBGap (% gap of fluid balance achieved vs. goal), all adjusted by patient's weight (kg) and duration of CRRT (hours).Data from 653 patients (median of 102.2 patient-hours of CRRT) were analyzed. Mean (SD) age was 56.7 (14.6) years and 61.9% were male. Hospital mortality rate was 64%. Despite FBGoal was similar in patients who died vs. survived, survivors achieved greater negative fluid balance during CRRT than non-survivors: median FBAchieved -0.25 [-0.52 to -0.05] vs. 0.06 [-0.26 to 0.62] ml/kg/h, p<0.001. Median NUF was lower in patients who died vs. survived: 1.06 [0.63-1.47] vs. 1.22 [0.82-1.69] ml/kg/h, p<0.001, and median %FBGap was higher in patients who died (112.8%, 61.5 to 165.7) vs. survived (64.2%, 30.5 to 91.8), p<0.001. In multivariable models, higher %FBGap was independently associated with increased risk of hospital mortality: aOR (95% CI) 1.01 (1.01-1.02), p<0.001. NUF was not associated with hospital mortality when adjusted by %FBGap and other clinical parameters: aOR 0.96 (0.72-1.28), p = 0.771.Higher %FBGap was independently associated with an increased risk of hospital mortality in critically ill adults with AKI on CRRT in whom clinicians prescribed negative fluid balance via CRRT. %FBGap represents a novel quality indicator of CRRT delivery that could assist with operationalizing fluid management interventions during CRRT."

https://openalex.org/W4293084514,"Colloidal particles constitute a substantial fraction of organic matter in the global ocean and an abundant component of the organic matter interacting with bacterial surfaces. Using E. coli ribosomes as model colloidal particles, we applied high-resolution atomic force microscopy to probe bacterial surface interactions with organic colloids to investigate particle attachment and relevant surface features. We observed the formation of ribosome films associating with marine bacteria isolates and natural seawater assemblages, and that bacteria readily utilized the added ribosomes as growth substrate. In exposure experiments ribosomes directly attached onto bacterial surfaces as 40-200 nm clusters and patches of individual particles. We found that certain bacterial cells expressed surface corrugations that range from 50-100 nm in size, and 20 nm deep. Furthermore, our AFM studies revealed surface pits in select bacteria that range between 50-300 nm in width, and 10-50 nm in depth. Our findings suggest novel adaptive strategies of pelagic marine bacteria for colloid capture and utilization as nutrients, as well as storage as nanoscale hotspots of DOM."

The latest remapping to update the distribution of schistosomiasis and STH was conducted seven years ago. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence, intensity and associated risk factors of Schistosoma mansoni and STH among schoolchildren in An-Nadirah District, Ibb Governorate, Yemen. A cross-sectional study was carried out among schoolchildren aged 6-15 years in four selected schools. Biological, demographic, socioeconomic and environmental data were collected using a pre-tested questionnaire. S. mansoni and STH eggs were detected and counted by the microscopic examination of Kato-Katz fecal smears. Out of 417 schoolchildren, 17.0% were infected with at least one intestinal helminth. Prevalence of S. mansoni and STH were 6.5% and 9.1%, respectively. The most prevalent parasite among STH was Ascaris lumbricoides (8.4%). Unemployed fathers (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 3.2; 95% Confidence interval (CI): 1.23, 8.52; P = 0.018), eating exposed food (AOR: 2.9; 95%CI = 1.24, 6.89; P = 0.014), not washing hands before eating and after defecation (AOR: 4.8; 95%CI = 1.77, 12.81; P = 0.002), and schools located close to water stream (AOR: 22.1; 95%CI = 5.12, 95.46; P <0.001) were independent risk factors of ascariasis. Swimming in ponds/stream (AOR: 3.9; 95%CI = 1.63, 9.55; P = 0.002), and schools close to the stream (AOR: 24.7; 95%CI = 3.05, 200.07; P = 0.003) were independent risk factors of intestinal schistosomiasis. The present study does not indicate a reduction in the prevalence of intestinal schistosomiasis in this rural area since the latest remapping conducted in 2014, although ascariasis was reduced by half. The prevalence of the two parasites was highly focal in areas close to the valley, suggesting a significant role of the stream in sustaining and accelerating the parasitic infection. Children practicing swimming and having poor hygienic practices were at high exposure to S. mansoni and A. lumbricoides, respectively. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene intervention, school-based health education, and snail control, in addition to mass drug administration, will help in the interruption of transmission of schistosomiasis and STH."
https://openalex.org/W4293093161,"Objective This study was conducted to describe secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure among non-smoking employees in the workplace, and identify factors related to SHS exposure in Qingdao. Methods The study participants covered key non-smoking places stipulated in the “Qingdao City Smoking Control Regulations,” which included three categories: restaurants, bars, and office buildings. Airborne nicotine concentration in the workplace and saliva cotinine concentration of employees were measured. The questionnaire included employees’ demographic factors, smoke-free measures in the workplace, employers’ tobacco hazard knowledge, and attitudes towards smoke-free policy. Results A total of 222 non-smoking employees and 46 non-smoking employers were included in the study. The median concentrations of airborne nicotine and salivary cotinine were 0.389 μg/m 3 and 0.575 ng/mL, respectively. Educational status, average number of workplace smokers per day, exposure time to SHS in the workplace, and whether smoking and non-smoking areas were divided significantly related to airborne nicotine concentration. Age, educational status, exposure time to SHS in the workplace, tobacco control training and publicity, and whether the employers support the “Qingdao Tobacco Control Regulation” were significantly related to salivary cotinine concentration. Conclusions Despite the implementation of the “Qingdao Smoking Control Regulations” in 2013, the workplace remains an important location for SHS exposure. Interventions such as raising workers’ awareness of the risks associated with SHS exposure through health education and developing smoking prevention and cessation programs to reduce SHS exposure in the workplace are urgently needed."

https://openalex.org/W4293102246,"Brands can be defined as psychological constructs residing in our minds. By analyzing brand associations, we can study the mental constructs around them. In this paper, we study brands as parts of an associative network based on a word association database. We explore the communities–closely-knit groups in the mind–around brand names in this structure using two community detection algorithms in the Hungarian word association database ConnectYourMind. We identify brand names inside the communities of a word association network and explain why these brand names are part of the community. Several detected communities contain brand names from the same product category, and the words in these categories were connected either to brands in the category or to words describing the product category. Based on our findings, we describe the mental position of brand names. We show that brand knowledge, product knowledge and real word knowledge interact with each other. We also show how the meaning of a product category arises and how this meaning is related to brand meaning. Our results suggest that words sharing the same community with brand names can be used in brand communication and brand positioning."

A radial basis function (RBF) neural network model with an automatic coding machine and fractional momentum was proposed for the prediction of technological innovation. Policy keywords for China's new energy vehicle policies issued over the years were quantified by the use of an Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. The training of the neural network model was completed by using policy keywords, synergy was measured as the input layer, and the number of synchronous patent applications was measured as the output layer. The predictive efficacies of the traditional neural network model and the improved neural network model were compared again to verify the applicability and accuracy of the improved neural network. Finally, the influence of the degree of synergy on technological innovation was revealed by changing the intensity of policy measures. This study provides a basis for the relevant departments to formulate industrial policies and improve innovation performance by enterprises."

The study in this paper is an interdisciplinary approach towards rapid and efficient medical diagnosis.An approach based on Z-numbers soft set (ZnSS)to medical diagnosis has been developed and is used to estimate whether two patterns or images are identical or approximately. The notion of Z-numbers soft set is proposed by combing the theory of soft set and Z-numbers theory. The basic properties of subset, equal, intersection, union and complement operations on the Z-numbers soft sets are defined and the similarity measure of two Z-numbers soft sets are also discussed in this paper.An illustrative example similar to existing studies is showed to verify the effectiveness and feasibility, which can highlight the proposed method and demonstrate the solution characteristics.Diagnosing diseases by uncertainty symptoms is not a direct and simple task at all.

SCT extracts are reported to be neuroprotective and have efficacy in improving cognition. However, it is still unclear which of the pharmacological mechanisms of SCT contribute to the therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative disorders. Hence, this study investigated two aspects-firstly, the abilities of neuroprotective sub-fractions from SCT on scavenging radicals, inhibiting some usual targets relevant to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD), and secondly utilizing the network pharmacology related methods to search probable mechanisms using Surflex-Dock program to show the key targets and corresponding SCT constituents. The results indicated sub-fractions from SCT could scavenge 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE), monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR). Furthermore, the results of gene ontology and docking analyses indicated the key targets involved in the probable treatment of AD or PD might be AChE, MAO-B, NMDAR subunit2B (GluN2B-NMDAR), adenosine A2A receptor and cannabinoid receptor 2, and the corresponding constituents in Sceletium tortuosum might be N-trans-feruloyl-3-methyldopamine, dihydrojoubertiamine and other mesembrine type alkaloids. In summary, this study has provided new evidence for the therapeutic potential of SCT in the treatment of AD or PD, as well as the key targets and notable constituents in SCT.

To provide high-quality services to users, a recommended tourism model is introduced in this paper. On the one hand, the tourism system utilises the users' historical interactions with different scenic spots to infer their short- and long-term favorites. Among them, the users' short-term demands are modelled through self-attention mechanism, and the proportion of short- and long-term favorites is calculated using the Euclidean distance. On the other hand, the system models the relationship between multiple scenic spots to strengthen the item relationship and further form the most relevant tourist recommendations."

In order to study the effect of Escherichia coli on coal flotation, we changed the concentration of Escherichia coli and pH in the coal flotation system and found that Escherichia coli had an adverse effect on coal flotation. The concentration of Escherichia coli was negatively correlated with the recovery of coal. When the concentration of Escherichia coli reached 5.0 × 109 cells/ml, the recovery of coal flotation was 50.25%, and the change of pH basically did not affect the adverse effect of Escherichia coli on coal flotation. The mechanism was studied through Zeta potential, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy and Contact angle measurements. The results revealed that Escherichia coli could be adsorbed to the coal surface by hydrogen bonding, which changed the hydrophobicity of the coal surface and then reduced the recovery of coal flotation."

This study was aimed to determine prevalence of dietary errors among in-patients at an international private hospital's food department, and to explore causes of error to suggest strategies to reduce such errors in the future. Thus, a sequential explanatory mixed-methods study was carried out. For the quantitative part, secondary data were collected on a daily basis over one-month. For qualitative data, errors arising during the meal flow process were traced to the source on the same day of error followed by qualitative interviews with person responsible. Quantitative data were analyzed in SPSS v.25 as percentages. Qualitative data were analyzed by deductive-inductive thematic analysis. Out of a total of 7041 diets, we found that only 17 had errors. Of these, almost two-thirds were critical. Majority of these errors took place during diet card preparation (52.94%), by dietitians (70.59%), during weekdays (82.35%), breakfasts (47.06%), and in the cardiac care ward (47.06%). The causes identified through interviews were lack of backup or accessory food staff, and employee's personal and domestic issues. It was concluded that even though the prevalence of dietary errors was low in this study, critical errors formed majority of these errors. Adopting organizational behavior strategies in the hospital may not only reduce dietary errors, but improve patients' well-being, and employee satisfaction in a long run."
https://openalex.org/W4293105793,"Glycosylation is one of the most important post-translational modifications of cell surface proteins involved in the proliferation, metastasis and treatment resistance of cancer cells. However, little is known about the role of glycosylation as the mechanism of breast cancer cell resistance to endocrine therapy. Herein, we aimed to identify the glycan profiles of tamoxifen-resistant human breast cancer cells, and their potential as predictive biomarkers for endocrine therapy. We established tamoxifen-resistant cells from estrogen receptor-positive human breast cancer cell lines, and their membrane-associated proteins were subjected to lectin microarray analysis. To confirm differential lectin binding to cellular glycoproteins, we performed lectin blotting analyses after electrophoretic separation of the glycoproteins. Mass spectrometry of the tryptic peptides of the lectin-bound glycoproteins was further conducted to identify glycoproteins binding to the above lectins. Finally, expression of the glycans that were recognized by a lectin was investigated using clinical samples from patients who received tamoxifen treatment after curative surgery. Lectin microarray analysis revealed that the membrane fractions of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells showed increased binding to Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) compared to tamoxifen-sensitive cells. Glycoproteins seemed to be responsible for the differential WFA binding and the results of mass spectrometry revealed several membrane glycoproteins, such as CD166 and integrin beta-1, as candidates contributing to increased WFA binding. In clinical samples, strong WFA staining was more frequently observed in patients who had developed distant metastasis during tamoxifen treatment compared with non-relapsed patients. Therefore, glycans recognized by WFA are potentially useful as predictive markers to identify the tamoxifen-resistant and relapse-prone subset of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W4293105855,"Approximately 1.29 million COVID-19 cases involving healthcare workers (HCWs) have been reported globally, leading to several hospitals conducting mass testing for early detection of infected HCWs. This study was conducted to report our experience and findings from the mass testing of HCWs from a public hospital in Sabah, Malaysia. The mass testing was conducted from 1st March 2020 to 30th June 2020, and involved self-reported data and laboratory results of 2089 HCWs. All HCWs who took at least two nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 testing at two different time intervals during the study period were included. Throughout the mass testing period, various strategies such as practices of the new norm, daily temperature and symptom checking, wearing of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), identification of high-risk areas and travel declaration of staffs were within the hospital for prevention of COVID-19 transmission. We observed a small percentage of COVID-19 infected HCWs (n = 19, 0.91%) from the mass testing. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 HCWs were almost equal in number. A majority of those infected were nurses (n = 16, 0.77%) who had contact exposure to COVID-19 positive person or person under investigation (PUI) (n = 15, 0.72%). Four of the COVID-19 infected HCWs (n = 4/19, 21.05%) had no contact exposure. These HCWs were not identified through contact tracing. Fortunately, they were detected during the mass testing and were isolated promptly. In conclusion, mass testing of HCWs helped in early identification of COVID-19 infected HCWs not identified through contact tracing. Strategies such as stratified mass testing, strict compliance to new norm, appropriate PPE usage and identification of high-risk area were effective in the prevention of COVID-19 infection among HCWs."
