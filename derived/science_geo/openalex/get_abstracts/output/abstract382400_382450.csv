https://openalex.org/W2069458273,"Teamwork is a fundamental aspect of many human activities, from business to art and from sports to science. Recent research suggest that team work is of crucial importance to cutting-edge scientific research, but little is known about how teamwork leads to greater creativity. Indeed, for many team activities, it is not even clear how to assign credit to individual team members. Remarkably, at least in the context of sports, there is usually a broad consensus on who are the top performers and on what qualifies as an outstanding performance.In order to determine how individual features can be quantified, and as a test bed for other team-based human activities, we analyze the performance of players in the European Cup 2008 soccer tournament. We develop a network approach that provides a powerful quantification of the contributions of individual players and of overall team performance.We hypothesize that generalizations of our approach could be useful in other contexts where quantification of the contributions of individual team members is important."

Here, we report on gross, aberrant constitutive activation of DNA damage signalling in low- and high-grade human gliomas, and analyze the sources of such endogenous genotoxic stress. Based on analyses of human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell lines, normal astrocytes and clinical specimens from grade II astrocytomas (n=41) and grade IV GBM (n=60), we conclude that the DDR machinery is constitutively activated in gliomas, as documented by phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX), activation of the ATM-Chk2-p53 pathway, 53BP1 foci and other markers. Oxidative DNA damage (8-oxoguanine) was high in some GBM cell lines and many GBM tumors, while it was low in normal brain and grade II astrocytomas, despite the degree of DDR activation was higher in grade II tumors. Markers indicative of ongoing DNA replication stress (Chk1 activation, Rad17 phosphorylation, replication protein A foci and single-stranded DNA) were present in GBM cells under high- or low-oxygen culture conditions and in clinical specimens of both low- and high-grade tumors. The observed global checkpoint signaling, in contrast to only focal areas of overabundant p53 (indicative of p53 mutation) in grade II astrocytomas, are consistent with DDR activation being an early event in gliomagenesis, initially limiting cell proliferation (low Ki-67 index) and selecting for mutations of p53 and likely other genes that allow escape (higher Ki-67 index) from the checkpoint and facilitate tumor progression. Overall, these results support the potential role of the DDR machinery as a barrier to gliomagenesis and indicate that replication stress, rather than oxidative stress, fuels the DNA damage signalling in early stages of astrocytoma development."

Evolutionary models of cancer predict that, following treatment, resistance emerges either because of outgrowth of an intrinsically resistant sub-clone or evolves in residual disease under the selective pressure of treatment. To investigate genetic evolution in high-grade serous (HGS) ovarian cancers, we first analysed cell line series derived from three cases of HGS carcinoma before and after platinum resistance had developed (PEO1, PEO4 and PEO6; PEA1 and PEA2; and PEO14 and PEO23). Analysis with 24-colour fluorescence in situ hybridisation and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) showed mutually exclusive endoreduplication and loss of heterozygosity events in clones present at different time points in the same individual. This implies that platinum-sensitive and -resistant disease was not linearly related, but shared a common ancestor at an early stage of tumour development. Array CGH analysis of six paired pre- and post-neoadjuvant treatment HGS samples from the CTCR-OV01 clinical study did not show extensive copy number differences, suggesting that one clone was strongly dominant at presentation. These data show that cisplatin resistance in HGS carcinoma develops from pre-existing minor clones but that enrichment for these clones is not apparent during short-term chemotherapy treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1975655284,"Immunotherapeutic strategies to stimulate anti-tumor immunity are promising approaches for cancer treatment. A major barrier to their success is the immunosuppressive microenvironment of tumors, which inhibits the functions of endogenous dendritic cells (DCs) that are necessary for the generation of anti-tumor CD8+ T cells. To overcome this problem, autologous DCs are generated ex vivo, loaded with tumor antigens, and activated in this non-suppressive environment before administration to patients. However, DC-based vaccines rarely induce tumor regression.We examined the fate and function of these DCs following their injection using murine models, in order to better understand their interaction with the host immune system. Contrary to previous assumptions, we show that DC vaccines have an insignificant role in directly priming CD8+ T cells, but instead function primarily as vehicles for transferring antigens to endogenous antigen presenting cells, which are responsible for the subsequent activation of T cells.This reliance on endogenous immune cells may explain the limited success of current DC vaccines to treat cancer and offers new insight into how these therapies can be improved. Future approaches should focus on creating DC vaccines that are more effective at directly priming T cells, or abrogating the tumor induced suppression of endogenous DCs."
https://openalex.org/W1979207158,"Bacterial and eukaryotic transfer RNAs have been shown to contain hypermodified adenosine, 2-methylthio-N(6)-threonylcarbamoyladenosine, at position 37 (A(37)) adjacent to the 3'-end of the anticodon, which is essential for efficient and highly accurate protein translation by the ribosome. Using a combination of bioinformatic sequence analysis and in vivo assay coupled to HPLC/MS technique, we have identified, from distinct sequence signatures, two methylthiotransferase (MTTase) subfamilies, designated as MtaB in bacterial cells and e-MtaB in eukaryotic and archaeal cells. Both subfamilies are responsible for the transformation of N(6)-threonylcarbamoyladenosine into 2-methylthio-N(6)-threonylcarbamoyladenosine. Recently, a variant within the human CDKAL1 gene belonging to the e-MtaB subfamily was shown to predispose for type 2 diabetes. CDKAL1 is thus the first eukaryotic MTTase identified so far. Using purified preparations of Bacillus subtilis MtaB (YqeV), a CDKAL1 bacterial homolog, we demonstrate that YqeV/CDKAL1 enzymes, as the previously studied MTTases MiaB and RimO, contain two [4Fe-4S] clusters. This work lays the foundation for elucidating the function of CDKAL1."
https://openalex.org/W2118246580,"Selection of pesticides with small ecological footprints is a key factor in developing sustainable agricultural systems. Policy guiding the selection of pesticides often emphasizes natural products and organic-certified pesticides to increase sustainability, because of the prevailing public opinion that natural products are uniformly safer, and thus more environmentally friendly, than synthetic chemicals.We report the results of a study examining the environmental impact of several new synthetic and certified organic insecticides under consideration as reduced-risk insecticides for soybean aphid (Aphis glycines) control, using established and novel methodologies to directly quantify pesticide impact in terms of biocontrol services. We found that in addition to reduced efficacy against aphids compared to novel synthetic insecticides, organic approved insecticides had a similar or even greater negative impact on several natural enemy species in lab studies, were more detrimental to biological control organisms in field experiments, and had higher Environmental Impact Quotients at field use rates.These data bring into caution the widely held assumption that organic pesticides are more environmentally benign than synthetic ones. All pesticides must be evaluated using an empirically-based risk assessment, because generalizations based on chemical origin do not hold true in all cases."
https://openalex.org/W2020054949,"Genetically modified mouse strains derived from embryonic stem (ES) cells have become essential tools for functional genomics and biomedical research. Large scale mutagenesis projects are producing libraries of mutant C57BL/6 (B6) ES cells to enable the functional annotation of every gene of the mouse genome. To realize the utility of these resources, efficient and accessible methods of generating mutant mice from these ES cells are necessary. Here, we describe a combination of ICR morula aggregation and a chemically-defined culture medium with widely available and accessible components for the high efficiency generation of germline transmitting chimeras from C57BL/6N ES cells. Together these methods will ease the access of the broader biomedical research community to the publicly available B6 ES cell resources."
https://openalex.org/W2122429215,"Background Oxytocin (OXT) has been implicated in a suite of complex social behaviors including observed choices in economic laboratory experiments. However, actual studies of associations between oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene variants and experimentally elicited social preferences are rare. Methodology/Principal Findings We test hypotheses of associations between social preferences, as measured by behavior in two economic games, and 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the OXTR gene in a sample of Swedish twins (n = 684). Two standard economic games, the dictator game and the trust game, both involving real monetary consequences, were used to elicit such preferences. After correction for multiple hypothesis testing, we found no significant associations between any of the 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and behavior in either of the games. Conclusion We were unable to replicate the most significant association reported in previous research between the amount donated in a dictator game and an OXTR genetic variant."
https://openalex.org/W1984516079,"Nocturnin is a circadian clock-regulated deadenylase thought to control mRNA expression post-transcriptionally through poly(A) tail removal. The expression of Nocturnin is robustly rhythmic in liver at both the mRNA and protein levels, and mice lacking Nocturnin are resistant to diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis. Here we report that Nocturnin expression is regulated by microRNA-122 (miR-122), a liver specific miRNA. We found that the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of Nocturnin mRNA harbors one putative recognition site for miR-122, and this site is conserved among mammals. Using a luciferase reporter construct with wild-type or mutant Nocturnin 3'-UTR sequence, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR-122 can down-regulate luciferase activity levels and that this effect is dependent on the presence of the putative miR-122 recognition site. Additionally, the use of an antisense oligonucleotide to knock down miR-122 in vivo resulted in significant up-regulation of both Nocturnin mRNA and protein expression in mouse liver during the night, resulting in Nocturnin rhythms with increased amplitude. Together, these data demonstrate that the normal rhythmic profile of Nocturnin expression in liver is shaped in part by miR-122. Previous studies have implicated Nocturnin and miR-122 as important post-transcriptional regulators of both lipid metabolism and circadian clock controlled gene expression in the liver. Therefore, the demonstration that miR-122 plays a role in regulating Nocturnin expression suggests that this may be an important intersection between hepatic metabolic and circadian control."
https://openalex.org/W1994875311,"Accumulating evidence suggests that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is a multifunctional kinase implicated in neuronal development, mood stabilization, and neurodegeneration. However, the synaptic actions of GSK-3 are largely unknown. In this study, we examined the impact of GSK-3 on AMPA receptor (AMPAR) channels, the major mediator of excitatory transmission, in cortical neurons. Application of GSK-3 inhibitors or knockdown of GSK-3 caused a significant reduction of the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC), a readout of the unitary strength of synaptic AMPARs. Treatment with GSK-3 inhibitors also decreased surface and synaptic GluR1 clusters on dendrites and increased internalized GluR1 in cortical cultures. Rab5, the small GTPase controlling the transport from plasma membrane to early endosomes, was activated by GSK-3 inhibitors. Knockdown of Rab5 prevented GSK-3 inhibitors from regulating mEPSC amplitude. Guanyl nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI), which regulates the cycle of Rab5 between membrane and cytosol, formed an increased complex with Rab5 after treatment with GSK-3 inhibitors. Blocking the function of GDI occluded the effect of GSK-3 inhibitors on mEPSC amplitude. In cells transfected with the non-phosphorylatable GDI mutant, GDI(S45A), GSK-3 inhibitors lost the capability to regulate GDI-Rab5 complex, mEPSC amplitude, and AMPAR surface expression. These results suggest that GSK-3, via altering the GDI-Rab5 complex, regulates Rab5-mediated endocytosis of AMPARs. It provides a potential mechanism underlying the role of GSK-3 in synaptic transmission and plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2008429932,"The JAK2 V617F mutation present in over 95% of Polycythemia Vera patients and in 50% of Essential Thrombocythemia and Primary Myelofibrosis patients renders the kinase constitutively active. In the absence of a three-dimensional structure for the full-length protein, the mechanism of activation of JAK2 V617F has remained elusive. In this study, we used functional mutagenesis to investigate the involvement of the JH2 alphaC helix in the constitutive activation of JAK2 V617F. We show that residue F595, located in the middle of the alphaC helix of JH2, is indispensable for the constitutive activity of JAK2 V617F. Mutation of F595 to Ala, Lys, Val or Ile significantly decreases the constitutive activity of JAK2 V617F, but F595W and F595Y are able to restore it, implying an aromaticity requirement at position 595. Substitution of F595 to Ala was also able to decrease the constitutive activity of two other JAK2 mutants, T875N and R683G, as well as JAK2 K539L, albeit to a lower extent. In contrast, the F595 mutants are activated by erythropoietin-bound EpoR. We also explored the relationship between the dimeric conformation of EpoR and several JAK2 mutants. Since residue F595 is crucial to the constitutive activation of JAK2 V617F but not to initiation of JAK2 activation by cytokines, we suggest that small molecules that target the region around this residue might specifically block oncogenic JAK2 and spare JAK2 wild-type."
https://openalex.org/W1995296009,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNA molecules that function to control gene expression and restrict viral replication in host cells. The production of miRNAs is believed to be dependent upon the DICER enzyme. Available evidence suggests that in T lymphocytes, HIV-1 can both suppress and co-opt the host's miRNA pathway for its own benefit. In this study, we examined the state of miRNA production in monocytes and macrophages as well as the consequences of viral infection upon the production of miRNA. Monocytes in general express low amounts of miRNA-related proteins, and DICER in particular could not be detected until after monocytes were differentiated into macrophages. In the case where HIV-1 was present prior to differentiation, the expression of DICER was suppressed. MicroRNA chip results for RNA isolated from transfected and treated cells indicated that a drop in miRNA production coincided with DICER protein suppression in macrophages. We found that the expression of DICER in monocytes is restricted by miR-106a, but HIV-1 suppressed DICER expression via the viral gene Vpr. Additionally, analysis of miRNA expression in monocytes and macrophages revealed evidence that some miRNAs can be processed by both DICER and PIWIL4. Results presented here have implications for both the pathology of viral infections in macrophages and the biogenesis of miRNAs. First, HIV-1 suppresses the expression and function of DICER in macrophages via a previously unknown mechanism. Second, the presence of miRNAs in monocytes lacking DICER indicates that some miRNAs can be generated by proteins other than DICER."
https://openalex.org/W1996732725,"Leptospirosis is a multisystem disease caused by pathogenic strains of the genus Leptospira. We have reported that Leptospira are able to bind plasminogen (PLG), to generate active plasmin in the presence of activator, and to degrade purified extracellular matrix fibronectin.We have now cloned, expressed and purified 14 leptospiral recombinant proteins. The proteins were confirmed to be surface exposed by immunofluorescence microscopy and were evaluated for their ability to bind plasminogen (PLG). We identified eight as PLG-binding proteins, including the major outer membrane protein LipL32, the previously published rLIC12730, rLIC10494, Lp29, Lp49, LipL40 and MPL36, and one novel leptospiral protein, rLIC12238. Bound PLG could be converted to plasmin by the addition of urokinase-type PLG activator (uPA), showing specific proteolytic activity, as assessed by its reaction with the chromogenic plasmin substrate, D-Val-Leu-Lys 4-nitroanilide dihydrochloride. The addition of the lysine analog 6-aminocaproic acid (ACA) inhibited the protein-PLG interaction, thus strongly suggesting the involvement of lysine residues in plasminogen binding. The binding of leptospiral surface proteins to PLG was specific, dose-dependent and saturable. PLG and collagen type IV competed with LipL32 protein for the same binding site, whereas separate binding sites were observed for plasma fibronectin.PLG-binding/activation through the proteins/receptors on the surface of Leptospira could help the bacteria to specifically overcome tissue barriers, facilitating its spread throughout the host."
https://openalex.org/W2013911584,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. The diagnosis of PD is challenging and currently none of the biochemical tests have proven to help in diagnosis. Serum metallomic analysis may suggest the possibility of diagnosis of PD.The metallomic analysis was targeted on 31 elements obtained from 42 healthy controls and 45 drug naive PD patients using ICP-AES and ICP-MS to determine the concentration variations of elements between PD and normal. The targeted metallomic analysis showed the significant variations in 19 elements of patients compared to healthy control (p<0.04). The partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) showed aluminium, copper, iron, manganese and zinc are the key elements, contributes the separation of PD patients from control samples. The correlation coefficient analysis and element-element ratio confirm the imbalance of inter-elements relationship in PD patients' serum. Furthermore, elements linkage map analysis showed aluminium is a key element involved in triggering of phosphorus, which subsequently lead to imbalance of homeostatic in PD serum. The execution of neural network using elements concentrations provides 95% accuracy in detection of disease.These results suggest that there is a disturbance in the elements homeostasis and inter-elements relationship in PD patients' serum. The analysis of serum elements helps in linking the underlying cellular processes such as oxidative stress, neuronal dysfunction and apoptosis, which are the dominating factors in PD. Also, these results increase the prospect of detection of early PD from serum through neural network algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W2114483830,"Background Animals' attitudes to risk are profoundly influenced by metabolic state (hunger and baseline energy stores). Specifically, animals often express a preference for risky (more variable) food sources when below a metabolic reference point (hungry), and safe (less variable) food sources when sated. Circulating hormones report the status of energy reserves and acute nutrient intake to widespread targets in the central nervous system that regulate feeding behaviour, including brain regions strongly implicated in risk and reward based decision-making in humans. Despite this, physiological influences per se have not been considered previously to influence economic decisions in humans. We hypothesised that baseline metabolic reserves and alterations in metabolic state would systematically modulate decision-making and financial risk-taking in humans. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a controlled feeding manipulation and assayed decision-making preferences across different metabolic states following a meal. To elicit risk-preference, we presented a sequence of 200 paired lotteries, subjects' task being to select their preferred option from each pair. We also measured prandial suppression of circulating acyl-ghrelin (a centrally-acting orexigenic hormone signalling acute nutrient intake), and circulating leptin levels (providing an assay of energy reserves). We show both immediate and delayed effects on risky decision-making following a meal, and that these changes correlate with an individual's baseline leptin and changes in acyl-ghrelin levels respectively. Conclusions/Significance We show that human risk preferences are exquisitely sensitive to current metabolic state, in a direction consistent with ecological models of feeding behaviour but not predicted by normative economic theory. These substantive effects of state changes on economic decisions perhaps reflect shared evolutionarily conserved neurobiological mechanisms. We suggest that this sensitivity in human risk-preference to current metabolic state has significant implications for both real-world economic transactions and for aberrant decision-making in eating disorders and obesity."

Methodology/Principal Findings An extensive aerosol sampling program was conducted in Darjeeling (altitude ∼2200 meter above sea level (masl), latitude 27°01′N and longitude 88°15′E), a high altitude station in northeastern Himalayas, during January–December 2005. Samples were collected using a respirable dust sampler and a fine dust sampler simultaneously. Ion chromatograph was used to analyze the water soluble ionic species of aerosol. The average concentrations of fine and coarse mode aerosol were found to be 29.5±20.8 µg m−3 and 19.6±11.1 µg m−3 respectively. Fine mode aerosol dominated during dry seasons and coarse mode aerosol dominated during monsoon. Nitrate existed as NH4NO3 in fine mode aerosol during winter and as NaNO3 in coarse mode aerosol during monsoon. Gas phase photochemical oxidation of SO2 during premonsoon and aqueous phase oxidation during winter and postmonsoon were the major pathways for the formation of SO42− in the atmosphere. Long range transport of dust aerosol from arid regions of western India was observed during premonsoon. The acidity of fine mode aerosol was higher in dry seasons compared to monsoon whereas the coarse mode acidity was higher in monsoon compared to dry seasons. Biomass burning, vehicular emissions and dust particles were the major types of aerosol from local and continental regions whereas sea salt particles were the major types of aerosol from marine source regions. Conclusions/Significance The year-long data presented in this paper provide substantial improvements to the heretofore poor knowledge regarding aerosol chemistry over northeastern Himalayas, and should be useful to policy makers in making control strategies."

We have shown previously that inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor-binding protein released with inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IRBIT) plays a critical role in stimulation of NHE3 in response to elevated intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). In this study, we investigated the role of IRBIT in mediating NHE3 activation by ANG II. IRBIT is abundantly expressed in the proximal tubules where NHE3 is located. ANG II at physiological concentrations stimulates NHE3 transport activity in a model proximal tubule cell line. ANG II-induced activation of NHE3 was abrogated by knockdown of IRBIT, whereas overexpression of IRBIT enhanced the effect of ANG II on NHE3. ANG II transiently increased binding of IRBIT to NHE3 at 5 min but became dissociated by 45 min. In comparison, it took at least 15 min of ANG II treatment for an increase in NHE3 activity and NHE3 surface expression. The stimulation of NHE3 by ANG II was dependent on changes in [Ca2+]i and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases II. Inhibition of CaMKII completely blocked the ANG II-induced binding of IRBIT to NHE3 and the increase in NHE3 surface abundance. Several serine residues of IRBIT are thought to be important for IRBIT binding. Mutations of Ser-68, Ser-71, and Ser-74 of IRBIT decreased binding of IRBIT to NHE3 and its effect on NHE3 activity. In conclusion, our current findings demonstrate that IRBIT is critically involved in mediating activation of NHE3 by ANG II via a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases II-dependent pathway.

Moreover, modulation of TRPM6 channel activity by intracellular ATP requires the ATP-binding motif in the α-kinase domain (14Thébault S. Cao G. Venselaar H. Xi Q. Bindels R.J. Hoenderop J.G. J. Biol.

Although the phosphorylation activity of the TRPM6/7 α-kinase domains has been well determined, the role of these domains in regulating channel activity remains elusive (12Cao G.

However, the effect of oxidative stress on the epithelial Mg2+ channel TRPM6, expressed at the apical membrane of the DCT, has not been studied. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the α-kinase domain in TRPM6 channel activity by the identification of associated proteins. To this end, the Ras recruitment system (RRS), a novel yeast two-hybrid screening system, which is designed to screen for partners of plasma membrane proteins, was applied (30Aronheim A. Methods. 2001; 24: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Here, we identified methionine sulfoxide reductase B1 (MsrB1) as a TRPM6-associated protein, binding to the TRPM6 α-kinase domain. Using biochemical, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological analyses, we demonstrated a novel operation mode for MsrB1 in the regulation of TRPM6 channel activity in oxidative stress through modulating methionine oxidation in TRPM6. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were grown and transfected as described previously (31Topala C.N. Groenestege W.T. Thébault S. van den Berg D. Nilius B. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Cell Calcium. 2007; 41: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and electrophysiological recordings were performed 48 h after transfection. The α-kinase domain of mouse (1759–2028) TRPM6 was cloned into the pMet425-Myc-Ras (kind gift from Dr. A. Aronheim, Haifa, Israel) by PCR using mouse kidney cDNA as template. The α-kinase domain of human (1759–2022) TRPM6 was cloned into the pEBG vector using human TRPM6 in pCINeo/IRES-GFP (32Voets T. Nilius B. Hoefs S. van der Kemp A.W. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J.

Full-length mouse MsrB1 cDNA was cloned into pCB7 by PCR using mouse kidney cDNA and FLAG-tagged at the N-terminal tail. Wild-type human TRPM6 in the pCINeo/IRES-GFP vector was HA-tagged at the N-terminal tail as described previously (32Voets T. Nilius B. Hoefs S. van der Kemp A.W. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J.

TRPM6 M1755A, TRPM6 M1775A, TRPM6 M1904A, and TRPM6 M1947A mutants were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All constructs were verified by sequence analysis. RRS screening was performed as described previously (30Aronheim A. Methods. 2001; 24: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, cdc25-2 strains (kind gift from Dr. A. Aronheim) were co-transformed with the pMet425-Myc-Ras-TRPM6 α-kinase domain and mouse kidney cDNA library. Transformants were grown on selectable minimal glucose plates for 5 days at 25 °C followed by subsequent replica plating onto minimal galactose plates, incubating for 5–7 days at 37 °C. Library plasmids of positive colonies growing on galactose plates at 37 °C were isolated and further analyzed by DNA sequencing. The positive colonies were co-transformed with the pMet425-Myc-Ras-TRPM6 α-kinase domain into cdc25-2 cells to confirm specificity of interaction. Total RNA isolation from mouse tissue and reverse transcription were performed as described previously (33van de Graaf S.F. Hoenderop J.G. Gkika D. Lamers D. Prenen J. Rescher U. Gerke V. Staub O. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1478-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). MsrB1 and β-actin were amplified by PCR and subsequently analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Patch clamp experiments were performed in the tight seal whole-cell configuration at room temperature using an EPC-10 patch clamp amplifier computer controlled by the Pulse software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Electrode resistances were 2–5 megaohms, and capacitance and access resistance were monitored continuously. A ramp protocol, consisting of linear voltage ramp from −100 to +100 mV (within 450 ms), was applied every 2 s from a holding potential of 0 mV. Current densities were obtained by normalizing the current amplitude to the cell membrane capacitance. The time course of current development was determined by measuring the current at +80 and −80 mV. I/V relations were established from the ramp protocols. The analysis and display of patch clamp data were performed using Igor Pro software (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). The standard pipette solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2. The extracellular solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2. To avoid breakdown, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was stored at 4 °C prior to use and added to the perfusate immediately (<1 min) prior to making recordings. HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with MsrB1 and pEBG-TRPM6-α-kinase or pEBG empty vector. 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed for 1 h on ice in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.33% (v/v) Triton X-100 including the protease inhibitors leupeptin (0.01 mg/ml), pepstatin (0.05 mg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm)). After centrifugation, supernatants of the lysates were incubated overnight with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads at 4 °C. In the co-precipitation experiment with full-length TRPM6, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with pEBG-MsrB1 and TRPM6 pCIneo/IRES-GFP or pCIneo/IRES-GFP empty vector and subsequently lysed and incubated on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads as described above. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The co-precipitation was analyzed using the anti-MsrB1 antibody (kind gift from Dr. J. Moskovitz, Lawrence, KS), mouse anti-HA (Sigma) antibody, or anti-GST antibody (Sigma). HEK293 cells, in poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated 10-cm dishes, were transiently transfected with 15 μg of HA-TRPM6. 72 h after transfection, cells were treated with 1 mm H2O2 for 10 min at 37 °C. Cell surface labeling with NHS-LC-LC-biotin (Pierce, Etten-Leur, The Netherlands) was performed as described previously (34Gkika D. Topala C.N. Chang Q. Picard N. Thébault S. Houillier P. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4707-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 1 h after homogenizing, biotinylated proteins were precipitated using NeutrAvidin-agarose beads (Pierce). TRPM6 expression was analyzed by immunoblot for the precipitates (plasma membrane fraction) and for the total cell lysates using the mouse anti-HA antibody. Protein samples were denatured by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in Laemmli buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were incubated with either mouse anti-HA or rabbit anti-MsrB1 antibody. Subsequently, blots were incubated with sheep horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and then visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (35Hoenderop J.G. Dardenne O. Van Abel M. Van Der Kemp A.W. Van Os C.H. St.-Arnaud R. Bindels R.J. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1398-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse kidney sections were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with rabbit anti-MsrB1 and guinea pig anti-TRPM6. To visualize TRPM6, tyramide signal amplification kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Zaventem, Belgium) was used after incubation with biotin-coated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Images were taken with a Bio-Rad MRC 100 confocal laser scanning microscope. Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance between groups was determined by analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. Differences between the means of two groups were analyzed by an unpaired Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To identify proteins interacting with the α-kinase domain of TRPM6, we applied the RRS. When compared with the conventional yeast two-hybrid screening system, RRS is more appropriate to detect interaction partners of plasma membrane proteins (30Aronheim A. Methods. 2001; 24: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this approach, MsrB1, a methionine sulfoxide reductase (36Grimaud R. Ezraty B. Mitchell J.K. Lafitte D. Briand C. Derrick P.J. Barras F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48915-48920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), was identified as an interacting protein of the TRPM6 α-kinase domain. Subsequently, MsrB1 cDNA was co-transformed with the α-kinase domain of TRPM6 into cdc25-2 yeast strain to confirm the interaction. As shown in Fig. 1A, whereas the cdc25-2 strains co-transformed with MsrB1 and the TRPM6 α-kinase domain grow at 37 °C, yeast co-transformed with the control vector and TRPM6 α-kinase domain only survived at 24 °C. The association between TRPM6 and MsrB1 was further substantiated by co-precipitation studies of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and GST-TRPM6-kinase in MsrB1-expressing HEK293 cells. MsrB1 co-precipitated with the GST-α-kinase but not with GST alone (Fig. 1B, upper panel). MsrB1 was equally expressed in the tested conditions (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Furthermore, co-precipitation studies of full-length TRPM6 with MsrB1 in HEK293 cells showed that full-length TRPM6 associates with GST-MsrB1 but not with GST alone (Fig. 1C, upper panel). TRPM6 and MsrB1 were expressed in all conditions tested (Fig. 1C, middle and bottom panel). To address the tissue distribution of MsrB1, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was performed on a panel of mouse tissues. The expected DNA fragment of MsrB1 was detected in all tissues as indicated in Fig. 1D. The integrity of the cDNA was confirmed by the detection of β-actin. To further study the co-expression of MsrB1 and TRPM6 in kidney, immunohistochemistry was performed on serial mouse kidney sections. This analysis indicated 70% immunopositive staining for MsrB1 in the TRPM6-expressing DCT segment, which has been implicated in active Mg2+ reabsorption (32Voets T. Nilius B. Hoefs S. van der Kemp A.W. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Hoenderop J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). Considering that MsrB1 is a stress protein that mainly exerts its function during oxidative stress (36Grimaud R. Ezraty B. Mitchell J.K. Lafitte D. Briand C. Derrick P.J. Barras F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48915-48920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that MsrB1 regulates TRPM6 channel activity during oxidative stress. Therefore, we examined the effect of H2O2 on TRPM6 channel activity. To this end, HEK293 cells expressing TRPM6 were treated with 1 mm H2O2 during whole-cell patch clamp recordings. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, H2O2 caused a significant inhibition of the TRPM6-mediated current (67 ± 5% of control, n = 13, p < 0.05) when compared with the non-treated cells (n = 11). Furthermore, we demonstrate that H2O2 inhibits TRPM6 channel activity in a dose-dependent effect with an IC50 of 148 μm (Fig. 2C). Next, the influence of H2O2 on the amount of TRPM6 channels at the plasma membrane was investigated by cell surface biotinylation experiments. As shown in Fig. 2D (upper panel), treatment with H2O2 did not affect the plasma membrane abundance of TRPM6. Of note, the protein levels of TRPM6 were equal in all tested conditions as verified by the total cell lysates (Fig. 2D, bottom panel). Next, the effect of MsrB1 on TRPM6 channel activity was investigated. Patch clamp analysis demonstrated that MsrB1 has no effect on TRPM6 channel activity (TRPM6 + empty vector, 250 ± 42 pA/pF; TRPM6 + MsrB1, 224 ± 37 pA/pF, p > 0.2). To investigate the role of MsrB1 on TRPM6 channel activity during oxidative stress, TRPM6 and MsrB1 were co-expressed in HEK293 cells and treated with H2O2 during whole-cell patch clamp recordings. Treatment with H2O2 significantly decreased TRPM6 current (67 ± 5% of control, n = 13, p < 0.05), whereas co-expression of MsrB1 significantly attenuated this inhibition (81 ± 5% of control, n = 13, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3, A and B). Because MsrB1 binds to the TRPM6 α-kinase domain and recovers the inhibitory effect of H2O2 on TRPM6 channel activity, we hypothesized that MsrB1 could reduce methionine oxidation of the α-kinase domain. Therefore, the methionine residues located on the periphery of the TRPM6 α-kinase domain three-dimensional structure, 4H. Venselaar, personal communication. which might be more vulnerable to H2O2, were mutated into alanines (namely M1755A, M1775A, M1947A, and M1904A as analyzed by Yasara software). Subsequent patch clamp analysis showed that only the TRPM6 M1755A mutant was not significantly inhibited by H2O2 (83 ± 6% of control, n = 12, p > 0.05) (Fig. 4, A and B). Of note, the other mutants were significantly inhibited by H2O2 (M1775A, 63 ± 10%, n = 8; M1904A, 64 ± 9%, n = 8; M1947A, 64 ± 7%, n = 10) (Fig. 4A). In the present study, we identified MsrB1 as a new TRPM6-associated protein and showed that MsrB1 recovers TRPM6 channel activity via reducing the oxidation state of Met1755 during oxidative stress. First, MsrB1 directly binds to the TRPM6 α-kinase domain and co-precipitates full-length TRPM6. Second, MsrB1 is co-expressed with TRPM6 in the renal DCT. Third, H2O2 inhibits TRPM6 channel activity without affecting the plasma membrane expression. Fourth, MsrB1 prevents the inhibitory effect of H2O2 on TRPM6 channel activity. Finally, H2O2 has no significant effect on the TRPM6 M1755A mutant. TRPM6 belongs to the TRPM subfamily of the TRP channels and is so far the only known channel directly mediating active transepithelial Mg2+ transport (4Konrad M. Schlingmann K.P. Gudermann T. Am. J.

However, the molecular regulation of this channel remains elusive. Here, we used a novel yeast two-hybrid procedure, RRS, to screen proteins interacting with the TRPM6 α-kinase domain. Our data showed that MsrB1 binds to the α-kinase domain of TRPM6, resulting in the recruitment of Ras to the membrane and subsequent complementation of the temperature-sensitive cdc25-2 mutation, so we identified MsrB1 as a new interacting protein of the TRPM6 α-kinase domain. This interaction has been confirmed by a subsequent GST co-precipitation assay in HEK293 cells with full-length TRPM6. Importantly, MsrB1 and TRPM6 are co-expressed in the renal DCT, which further substantiates the physiological relevance of the interaction between both proteins. MsrB1 is an oxidoreductase that catalyzes the thiol-dependent reduction of methionine sulfoxide (36Grimaud R. Ezraty B. Mitchell J.K. Lafitte D. Briand C. Derrick P.J. Barras F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48915-48920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). MsrB1 belongs to the Msr family composed of MsrA and MsrB. Mammals contain one MsrA and three MsrBs that are highly abundant in kidney, liver, heart, and nervous tissue (37Moskovitz J. Weissbach H. Brot N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

These enzymes protect cells from oxidative stress via the repair of oxidative damage to proteins and thereby restore biological activity. They can be involved in reactive oxygen species-mediated signal transduction through modulation of the function of target proteins (36Grimaud R. Ezraty B. Mitchell J.K. Lafitte D. Briand C.

Accumulating data showed that reversible methionine oxidation and reduction play a dynamic role in a variety of cellular signaling pathways (45Bigelow D.J. Squier T.C. Biochim. Biophys.

For example, the methionine residues of Helix-3, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII), shaker voltage-dependent K+ channel, and Slo1 K+ channels can be oxidized and hereby regulate their function (46Colombo G.

Cell. 2008; 133: 462-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). It has been shown that oxidation of a methionine residue in the shaker voltage-dependent K+ channel disrupts its inactivation. This effect can be reversed by co-expression with MsrA1 (47Ciorba M.A. Heinemann S.H. Weissbach H. Brot N. Hoshi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 9932-9937Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed that MsrB1 interacts with the TRPM6 α-kinase domain but does not affect the channel activity in normoxic conditions. However, H2O2 is a product during oxidative stress and has been studied in relation to potassium channel function and the TRPM2 channel (reviewed in Refs. 50Eisfeld J. Lückhoff A. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2007; 179: 237-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and 51Liu Y. Gutterman D.D. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2002; 29: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that H2O2 significantly decreases the TRPM6-mediated current in HEK293 cells in a dose-dependent manner. As H2O2 did not change the surface expression of TRPM6, it possibly regulates TRPM6 channel activity directly through modulation of the channel conductance. Importantly, the decreased TRPM6 channel activity can be partly recovered by co-expression with MsrB1. This partial recovery could be explained by the fact that Msrs function optimally at 37 °C (52Moskovitz J. Berlett B.S. Poston J.M. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 9585-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), whereas our experiments were performed at room temperature. Another possible explanation is the time lapse of MsrB1 functioning, which is likely slower than the oxidation by H2O2. Free and protein-bound methionine residues are among the most susceptible to oxidation by reactive oxygen species (53Stadtman E.R. Levine R.L. Amino Acids. 2003; 25: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). It is proposed that surface-exposed methionine residues in a protein constitute an antioxidant defense mechanism because various oxidants can easily react with these residues to form methionine sulfoxide. Reduction back to methionine by methionine sulfoxide reductases could catalytically drive this antioxidant system as has been suggested by several studies (54Levine R.L. Mosoni L. Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 15036-15040Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 55Yao Y. Yin D. Jas G.S. Kuczer K. Williams T.D. Schöneich C. Squier T.C.

Res. 1995; 12: 2049-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, the methionine residues located on the periphery of the TRPM6 α-kinase domain three-dimensional structure4 were examined. Four methionine residues (Met1755, Met1775, Met1904, and Met1947) were mutated into alanines, and their channel activity was studied upon H2O2 treatment. Mutation of Met1755 to Ala significantly attenuates the effect of H2O2 on TRPM6 channel activity, mimicking the MsrB1 effect (co-expression of MsrB1, 81 ± 5% of control; M1755A, 83 ± 6% of control). These data suggest that Met1755 is a crucial target of H2O2. Notably, renal DCT cells contain the largest number of mitochondria, the major source of endogenous H2O2, per unit length of any cell along the nephron, underlying a vast source of intracellular H2O2 (57Madsen K.M. Verlander J.W. Tisher C.C. J. Electron. Microsc. Tech. 1988; 9: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). TRPM6 is predominantly expressed in DCT and is inhibited by H2O2. Therefore, it is conceivable that the metabolic state of DCT cells, which influences the abundance of reactive oxygen species generated from mitochondria, modulates the Mg2+ reabsorption via TRPM6. Taken together, our study demonstrated that H2O2 inhibits TRPM6 channel activity and pointed out Met1775 as an important target for channel oxidation. Moreover, its interacting protein MsrB1 dynamically regulates this oxidative effect on TRPM6. These data provide insight into the molecular basis of TRPM6 channel regulation and transepithelial Mg2+ (re)absorption. Our findings present the first example of modulating TRP channel activity by methionine oxidation and contribute to a further understanding of the regulation of TRP channels by novel post-translational modifications.

https://openalex.org/W1972204534,"Enzymatic processing of extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecules by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) is crucial in mediating physiological and pathological cell processes. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to effective physiological enzyme-ECM interactions remain elusive. Only scant information is available on the mode by which matrix proteases degrade ECM substrates. An example is the enzymatic degradation of triple helical collagen II fragments, generated by the collagenase MMP-8 cleavage, during the course of acute inflammatory conditions by gelatinase B/MMP-9. As is the case for many other matrix proteases, it is not clear how MMP-9 recognizes, binds and digests collagen in this important physiological process. We used single molecule imaging to directly visualize this protease during its interaction with collagen fragments. We show that the initial binding is mediated by the diffusion of the protease along the ordered helix on the collagen (3/4) fragment, with preferential binding of the collagen tail. As the reaction progressed and prior to collagen degradation, gelatin-like morphologies resulting from the denaturation of the triple helical collagen were observed. Remarkably, this activity was independent of enzyme proteolysis and was accompanied by significant conformational changes of the working protease. Here we provide the first direct visualization of highly complex mechanisms of macromolecular interactions governing the enzymatic processing of ECM substrates by physiological protease."
https://openalex.org/W2142436715,"The role of amyloid β (Aβ) peptide in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease is linked to the presence of soluble Aβ species. Sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) promote Aβ fibrillogenesis and reduce the toxicity of the peptide in neuronal cell cultures, but a satisfactory rationale to explain these effects at the molecular level has not been provided yet. We have used circular dichroism, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy, protease digestion, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the association of the 42-residue fragment Aβ42 with sulfated GAGs, hyaluronan, chitosan, and poly(vinyl sulfate) (PVS). Our results indicate that the formation of stable Aβ42 fibrils is promoted by polymeric GAGs with negative charges placed in-frame with the 4.8-Å separating Aβ42 monomers within protofibrillar β-sheets. Incubation of Aβ42 with excess sulfated GAGs and hyaluronan increased amyloid fibril content and resistance to proteolysis 2- to 5-fold, whereas in the presence of the cationic polysaccharide chitosan, Aβ42 fibrillar species were reduced by 25% and sensitivity to protease degradation increased ∼3-fold. Fibrils of intermediate stability were obtained in the presence of PVS, an anionic polymer with more tightly packed charges than GAGs. Important structural differences between Aβ42 fibrils induced by PVS and Aβ42 fibrils obtained in the presence of GAGs and hyaluronan were observed by AFM, whereas mainly precursor protofibrillar forms were detected after incubation with chitosan. Computed binding energies per peptide from −11.2 to −13.5 kcal/mol were calculated for GAGs and PVS, whereas a significantly lower value of −7.4 kcal/mol was obtained for chitosan. Taken together, our data suggest a simple and straightforward mechanism to explain the role of GAGs as enhancers of the formation of insoluble Aβ42 fibrils trapping soluble toxic forms.—Valle-Delgado, J.

https://openalex.org/W2137289976,"The interaction of Bcl-2 family proteins at the mitochondrial outer membrane controls membrane permeability and thereby the apoptotic program. The anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 binds to the pro-apoptotic protein Bax to prevent Bax homo-oligomerization required for membrane permeabilization. Here, we used site-specific photocross-linking to map the surfaces of Bax and Bcl-2 that interact in the hetero-complex formed in a Triton X-100 micelle as a membrane surrogate. Heterodimer-specific photoadducts were detected from multiple sites in Bax and Bcl-2. Many of the interaction sites are located in the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) region of Bax and the BH1-3 groove of Bcl-2 that likely form the BH3-BH1-3 groove interface. However, other interaction sites form a second interface that includes helix 6 of Bax and the BH4 region of Bcl-2. Loss-of-function mutations in the BH3 region of Bax and the BH1 region of Bcl-2 disrupted the BH3-BH1-3 interface, as expected. Surprisingly the second interface was also disrupted by these mutations. Similarly, a loss-of-function mutation in the BH4 region of Bcl-2 that forms part of the second interface also disrupted both interfaces. As expected, both kinds of mutation abolished Bcl-2-mediated inhibition of Bax oligomerization in detergent micelles. Therefore, Bcl-2 binds Bax through two interdependent interfaces to inhibit the pro-apoptotic oligomerization of Bax."
https://openalex.org/W2009759097,"During an immune response T cells enter memory fate determination, a program that divides them into two main populations: effector memory and central memory T cells. Since in many systems protection appears to be preferentially mediated by T cells of the central memory it is important to understand when and how fate determination takes place. To date, cell intrinsic molecular events that determine their differentiation remains unclear. MicroRNAs are a class of small, evolutionarily conserved RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression, causing translational repression and/or messenger RNA degradation. Here, using an in vitro system where activated CD8 T cells driven by IL-2 or IL-15 become either effector memory or central memory cells, we assessed the role of microRNAs in memory T cell fate determination. We found that fate determination to central memory T cells is under the balancing effects of a discrete number of microRNAs including miR-150, miR-155 and the let-7 family. Based on miR-150 a new target, KChIP.1 (K + channel interacting protein 1), was uncovered, which is specifically upregulated in developing central memory CD8 T cells. Our studies indicate that cell fate determination such as surface phenotype and self-renewal may be decided at the pre-effector stage on the basis of the balancing effects of a discrete number of microRNAs. These results may have implications for the development of T cell vaccines and T cell-based adoptive therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2169337170,"Parasites can strongly affect the evolution of their hosts, but their effects on host diversification are less clear. In theory, contrasting parasite communities in different foraging habitats could generate divergent selection on hosts and promote ecological speciation. Immune systems are costly to maintain, adaptable, and an important component of individual fitness. As a result, immune system genes, such as those of the Major Histocompatability Complex (MHC), can change rapidly in response to parasite-mediated selection. In threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), as well as in other vertebrates, MHC genes have been linked with female mating preference, suggesting that divergent selection acting on MHC genes might influence speciation. Here, we examined genetic variation at MHC Class II loci of sticklebacks from two lakes with a limnetic and benthic species pair, and two lakes with a single species. In both lakes with species pairs, limnetics and benthics differed in their composition of MHC alleles, and limnetics had fewer MHC alleles per individual than benthics. Similar to the limnetics, the allopatric population with a pelagic phenotype had few MHC alleles per individual, suggesting a correlation between MHC genotype and foraging habitat. Using a simulation model we show that the diversity and composition of MHC alleles in a sympatric species pair depends on the amount of assortative mating and on the strength of parasite-mediated selection in adjacent foraging habitats. Our results indicate parallel divergence in the number of MHC alleles between sympatric stickleback species, possibly resulting from the contrasting parasite communities in littoral and pelagic habitats of lakes."
https://openalex.org/W2145152152,"Background Adults exhibiting severe impulsive and aggressive behaviors have multiple indices of low serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission. It remains unclear though whether low 5-HT mediates the behavior or instead reflects a pre-existing vulnerability trait. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, positron emission tomography with the tracer alpha-[11C]methyl-L-tryptophan (11C-AMT) was used to compare 5-HT synthesis capacity in two groups of adult males from a 21-year longitudinal study (mean age ± SD: 27.1±0.7): individuals with a history of childhood-limited high physical aggression (C-LHPA; N = 8) and individuals with normal (low) patterns of physical aggression (LPA; N = 18). The C-LHPA males had significantly lower trapping of 11C-AMT bilaterally in the orbitofrontal cortex and self-reported more impulsiveness. Despite this, in adulthood there were no group differences in plasma tryptophan levels, genotyping, aggression, emotional intelligence, working memory, computerized measures of impulsivity, psychosocial functioning/adjustment, and personal and family history of mood and substance abuse disorders. Conclusions/Significance These results force a re-examination of the low 5-HT hypothesis as central in the biology of violence. They suggest that low 5-HT does not mediate current behavior and should be considered a vulnerability factor for impulsive-aggressive behavior that may or may not be expressed depending on other biological factors, experience, and environmental support during development."
https://openalex.org/W2168083354,"Atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias can be perpetuated by up-regulation of inward rectifier potassium channels. Thus, it may be beneficial to block inward rectifier channels under conditions in which their function becomes arrhythmogenic (e.g., inherited gain-of-function mutation channelopathies, ischemia, and chronic and vagally mediated atrial fibrillation). We hypothesize that the antimalarial quinoline chloroquine exerts potent antiarrhythmic effects by interacting with the cytoplasmic domains of Kir2.1 (I(K1)), Kir3.1 (I(KACh)), or Kir6.2 (I(KATP)) and reducing inward rectifier potassium currents. In isolated hearts of three different mammalian species, intracoronary chloroquine perfusion reduced fibrillatory frequency (atrial or ventricular), and effectively terminated the arrhythmia with resumption of sinus rhythm. In patch-clamp experiments chloroquine blocked I(K1), I(KACh), and I(KATP). Comparative molecular modeling and ligand docking of chloroquine in the intracellular domains of Kir2.1, Kir3.1, and Kir6.2 suggested that chloroquine blocks or reduces potassium flow by interacting with negatively charged amino acids facing the ion permeation vestibule of the channel in question. These results open a novel path toward discovering antiarrhythmic pharmacophores that target specific residues of the cytoplasmic domain of inward rectifier potassium channels."

Despite recent attention, their finer structural details and precise adhesion mechanisms have yet to be determined. Fap1 (Fimbriae-associated protein 1) is the major structural subunit of serine-rich repeat fimbriae from Streptococcus parasanguinis and plays an essential role in fimbrial biogenesis, adhesion, and the early stages of dental plaque formation. Combining multidisciplinary, high resolution structural studies with biological assays, we provide new structural insight into adhesion by Fap1. We propose a model in which the serine-rich repeats of Fap1 subunits form an extended structure that projects the N-terminal globular domains away from the bacterial surface for adhesion to the salivary pellicle. We also uncover a novel pH-dependent conformational change that modulates adhesion and likely plays a role in survival in acidic environments."
https://openalex.org/W2145078417,"Oncogene-mediated premature senescence has emerged as a potential tumor-suppressive mechanism in early cancer transitions. Many studies showed that Ras and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) participate in premature senescence. Our previous work indicated that the HMG box-containing protein 1 (HBP1) transcription factor is involved in Ras- and p38 MAPK-induced premature senescence, but the mechanism of which has not yet been identified. Here, we showed that the p16(INK4A) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor is a novel target of HBP1 participating in Ras-induced premature senescence. The promoter of the p16(INK4A) gene contains an HBP1-binding site at position -426 to -433 bp from the transcriptional start site. HBP1 regulates the expression of the endogenous p16(INK4A) gene through direct sequence-specific binding. With HBP1 expression and the subsequent increase of p16(INK4A) gene expression, Ras induces premature senescence in primary cells. The data suggest a model in which Ras and p38 MAPK signaling engage HBP1 and p16(INK4A) to trigger premature senescence. In addition, we report that HBP1 knockdown is also required for Ras-induced transformation. All the data indicate that the mechanism of HBP1-mediated transcriptional regulation is important for not only premature senescence but also tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2165941857,"Cerebral malaria (CM) represents a severe outcome of the Plasmodium falciparum infection. Recent genetic studies have correlated human genes with severe malaria susceptibility, but there is little data on genetic variants that increase the risk of developing specific malaria clinical complications. Nevertheless, susceptibility to experimental CM in the mouse has been linked to host genes including Transforming Growth Factor Beta 2 (TGFB2) and Heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1). Here, we tested whether those genes were governing the risk of progressing to CM in patients with severe malaria syndromes.We report that the clinical outcome of P. falciparum infection in a cohort of Angolan children (n = 430) correlated with nine TGFB2 SNPs that modify the risk of progression to CM as compared to other severe forms of malaria. This genetic effect was explained by two haplotypes harboring the CM-associated SNPs (Pcorrec. = 0.035 and 0.036). In addition, one HMOX1 haplotype composed of five CM-associated SNPs increased the risk of developing the CM syndrome (Pcorrec. = 0.002) and was under-transmitted to children with uncomplicated malaria (P = 0.036). Notably, the HMOX1-associated haplotype conferred increased HMOX1 mRNA expression in peripheral blood cells of CM patients (P = 0.012).These results represent the first report on CM genetic risk factors in Angolan children and suggest the novel hypothesis that genetic variants of the TGFB2 and HMOX1 genes may contribute to confer a specific risk of developing the CM syndrome in patients with severe P. falciparum malaria. This work may provide motivation for future studies aiming to replicate our findings in larger populations and to confirm a role for these genes in determining the clinical course of malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2085308603,"Background Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a disease of multiple etiologies with several common pathological features, including inflammation and pulmonary vascular remodeling. Recent evidence has suggested a potential role for the recruitment of bone marrow-derived (BMD) progenitor cells to this remodeling process. We recently demonstrated that hypoxia-induced mitogenic factor (HIMF/FIZZ1/RELMα) is chemotactic to murine bone marrow cells in vitro and involved in pulmonary vascular remodeling in vivo. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a mouse bone marrow transplant model in which lethally irradiated mice were rescued with bone marrow transplanted from green fluorescent protein (GFP)+ transgenic mice to determine the role of HIMF in recruiting BMD cells to the lung vasculature during PH development. Exposure to chronic hypoxia and pulmonary gene transfer of HIMF were used to induce PH. Both models resulted in markedly increased numbers of BMD cells in and around the pulmonary vasculature; in several neomuscularized small (∼20 µm) capillary-like vessels, an entirely new medial wall was made up of these cells. We found these GFP+ BMD cells to be positive for stem cell antigen-1 and c-kit, but negative for CD31 and CD34. Several of the GFP+ cells that localized to the pulmonary vasculature were α-smooth muscle actin+ and localized to the media layer of the vessels. This finding suggests that these cells are of mesenchymal origin and differentiate toward myofibroblast and vascular smooth muscle. Structural location in the media of small vessels suggests a functional role in the lung vasculature. To examine a potential mechanism for HIMF-dependent recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells to the pulmonary vasculature, we performed a cell migration assay using cultured human mesenchymal stem cells (HMSCs). The addition of recombinant HIMF induced migration of HMSCs in a phosphoinosotide-3-kinase-dependent manner. Conclusions/Significance These results demonstrate HIMF-dependent recruitment of BMD mesenchymal-like cells to the remodeling pulmonary vasculature."
https://openalex.org/W2077834241,"Sepsis results in a profound state of immunosuppression, which is temporally associated with impaired leukocyte function. The mechanism of leukocyte reprogramming in sepsis is incompletely understood. In this study, we explored mechanisms contributing to dysregulated inflammatory cytokine expression by pulmonary macrophages during experimental sepsis. Pulmonary macrophages (PM) recovered from the lungs of mice undergoing cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) display transiently reduced expression of some, but not all innate genes in response to LPS. Impaired expression of TNF-α and iNOS was associated with reduced acetylation and methylation of specific histones (AcH4 and H3K4me3) and reduced binding of RNA polymerase II to the promoters of these genes. Transient impairment in LPS-induced cytokine responses in septic PM temporally correlated with induction of IRAK-M mRNA and protein, which occurred in a MyD88-dependent fashion. PM isolated from IRAK-M−/− mice were largely refractory to CLP-induced impairment in cytokine expression, chromatin remodeling, recruitment of RNA polymerase II, and induction of histone deacetylase-2 observed during sepsis. Our findings indicate that systemic sepsis induces epigenetic silencing of cytokine gene expression in lung macrophages, and IRAK-M appears to be a critical mediator of this response."
https://openalex.org/W2040845886,"Ribavirin (RBV) is a synthetic nucleoside analog with broad spectrum antiviral activity. Although RBV is approved for the treatment of hepatitis C virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and Lassa fever virus infections, its mechanism of action and therapeutic efficacy remains highly controversial. Recent reports show that the development of cell-based resistance after continuous RBV treatment via decreased RBV uptake can greatly limit its efficacy. Here, we examined whether certain cell types are naturally resistant to RBV even without prior drug exposure. Seven different cell lines from various host species were compared for RBV antiviral activity against two nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, a rhabdovirus) and Sendai virus (SeV, a paramyxovirus). Our results show striking differences between cell types in their response to RBV, ranging from virtually no antiviral effect to very effective inhibition of viral replication. Despite differences in viral replication kinetics for VSV and SeV in the seven cell lines, the observed pattern of RBV resistance was very similar for both viruses, suggesting that cellular rather than viral determinants play a major role in this resistance. While none of the tested cell lines was defective in RBV uptake, dramatic variations were observed in the long-term accumulation of RBV in different cell types, and it correlated with the antiviral efficacy of RBV. While addition of guanosine neutralized RBV only in cells already highly resistant to RBV, actinomycin D almost completely reversed the RBV effect (but not uptake) in all cell lines. Together, our data suggest that RBV may inhibit the same virus via different mechanisms in different cell types depending on the intracellular RBV metabolism. Our results strongly point out the importance of using multiple cell lines of different origin when antiviral efficacy and potency are examined for new as well as established drugs in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1971057076,"In animal groups such as herds, schools, and flocks, a certain distance is maintained between adjacent individuals, allowing them to move as a cohesive unit. Proximate causations of the cohesive and coordinated movement under dynamic conditions, however, have been poorly understood.We established a novel and simple behavioral assay using pairs of small fish (medaka and dwarf pufferfish) by eliciting a simultaneous optomotor response (OMR). We demonstrated that two homospecific fish began to move cohesively and maintained a distance of 2 to 4 cm between them when an OMR was elicited simultaneously in the fish. The coordinated and cohesive movement was not exhibited under a static condition. During the cohesive movement, the relative position of the two fish was not stable. Furthermore, adult medaka exhibited the cohesive movement but larvae did not, despite the fact that an OMR could be elicited in larvae, indicating that this ability to coordinate movement develops during maturation. The cohesive movement was detected in homospecific pairs irrespective of body-color, sex, or albino mutation, but was not detected between heterospecific pairs, suggesting that coordinated movement is based on a conspecific interaction.Our findings demonstrate that coordinated behavior between a pair of animals was elicited by a simultaneous OMR in two small fish. This is the first report to demonstrate induction of a schooling-like movement in a pair of fish by an OMR and to investigate the effect of age, sex, body color, and species on coordination between animals under a dynamic condition."
https://openalex.org/W2065720254,"Background Multi drug resistance (MDR) or cross-resistance to multiple classes of chemotherapeutic agents is a major obstacle to successful application of chemotherapy and a basic problem in cancer biology. The multidrug resistance gene, MDR1, and its gene product P-glycoprotein (P-gp) are an important determinant of MDR. Therefore, there is an urgent need for development of novel compounds that are not substrates of P-glycoprotein and are effective against drug-resistant cancer. Methodology/Principal Findings In this present study, we have synthesized a novel, redox active Fe (II) complex (chelate), iron N- (2-hydroxy acetophenone) glycinate (FeNG). The structure of the complex has been determined by spectroscopic means. To evaluate the cytotoxic effect of FeNG we used doxorubicin resistant and/or sensitive T lymphoblastic leukemia cells and show that FeNG kills both the cell types irrespective of their MDR phenotype. Moreover, FeNG induces apoptosis in doxorubicin resistance T lymphoblastic leukemia cell through mitochondrial pathway via generation reactive oxygen species (ROS). This is substantiated by the fact that the antioxidant N-acetyle-cysteine (NAC) could completely block ROS generation and, subsequently, abrogated FeNG induced apoptosis. Therefore, FeNG induces the doxorubicin resistant T lymphoblastic leukemia cells to undergo apoptosis and thus overcome MDR. Conclusion/Significance Our study provides evidence that FeNG, a redox active metal chelate may be a promising new therapeutic agent against drug resistance cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2081778862,"Background Aquatic tentacled snakes (Erpeton tentaculatus) can take advantage of their prey's escape response by startling fish with their body before striking. The feint usually startles fish toward the snake's approaching jaws. But when fish are oriented at a right angle to the jaws, the C-start escape response translates fish parallel to the snake's head. To exploit this latter response, snakes must predict the future location of the fish. Adult snakes can make this prediction. Is it learned, or are tentacled snakes born able to predict future fish behavior? Methods and Findings Laboratory-born, naïve snakes were investigated as they struck at fish. Trials were recorded at 250 or 500 frames per second. To prevent learning, snakes were placed in a water container with a clear transparency sheet or glass bottom. The chamber was placed over a channel in a separate aquarium with fish below. Thus snakes could see and strike at fish, without contact. The snake's body feint elicited C-starts in the fish below the transparency sheet, allowing strike accuracy to be quantified in relationship to the C-starts. When fish were oriented at a right angle to the jaws, naïve snakes biased their strikes to the future location of the escaping fish's head, such that the snake's jaws and the fish's translating head usually converged. Several different types of predictive strikes were observed. Conclusions The results show that some predators have adapted their nervous systems to directly compensate for the future behavior of prey in a sensory realm that usually requires learning. Instead of behavior selected during their lifetime, newborn tentacled snakes exhibit behavior that has been selected on a different scale—over many generations. Counter adaptations in fish are not expected, as tentacled snakes are rare predators exploiting fish responses that are usually adaptive."
https://openalex.org/W2022759858,"Studies in vitro indicate that group X secretory phospholipase A(2) (GX sPLA(2)) potently releases arachidonic acid (AA) and lysophosphatidylcholine from mammalian cell membranes. To define the function of GX sPLA(2) in vivo, our laboratory recently generated C57BL/6 mice with targeted deletion of GX sPLA(2) (GX(-/-) mice). When fed a normal rodent diet, GX(-/-) mice gained significantly more weight and had increased adiposity compared to GX(+/+) mice, which was not attributable to alterations in food consumption or energy expenditure. When treated with adipogenic stimuli ex vivo, stromal vascular cells isolated from adipose tissue of GX(-/-) mice accumulated significantly more (20%) triglyceride compared to cells from GX(+/+) mice. Conversely, overexpression of GX sPLA(2), but not catalytically inactive GX sPLA(2), resulted in a significant 50% reduction in triglyceride accumulation in OP9 adipocytes. The induction of genes encoding adipogenic proteins (PPARγ, SREBP-1c, SCD1, and FAS) was also significantly blunted by 50-80% in OP9 cells overexpressing GX sPLA(2). Activation of the liver X receptor (LXR), a nuclear receptor known to up-regulate adipogenic gene expression, was suppressed in 3T3-L1 and OP9 cells when GX sPLA(2) was overexpressed. Thus, hydrolytic products generated by GX sPLA(2) negatively regulate adipogenesis, possibly by suppressing LXR activation."

Nevertheless, the efficacy of this type of vaccine is influenced by the lack of an effective mucosal adjuvant. Methodology/Principal Findings Mice were immunized via the nasal route with lipopolysaccharide isolated from F. tularensis and neisserial recombinant PorB as an adjuvant candidate. Then, mice were challenged via the same route with the F. tularensis attenuated live vaccine strain (LVS). Mouse survival and analysis of a number of immune parameters were conducted following intranasal challenge. Vaccination induced a systemic antibody response and 70% of mice were protected from challenge as showed by their improved survival and weight regain. Lungs from mice recovering from infection presented prominent lymphoid aggregates in peribronchial and perivascular areas, consistent with the location of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT). BALT areas contained proliferating B and T cells, germinal centers, T cell infiltrates, dendritic cells (DCs). We also observed local production of antibody generating cells and homeostatic chemokines in BALT areas. Conclusions These data indicate that PorB might be an optimal adjuvant candidate for improving the protective effect of F. tularensis antigens. The presence of BALT induced after intranasal challenge in vaccinated mice might play a role in regulation of local immunity and long-term protection, but more work is needed to elucidate mechanisms that lead to its formation."
https://openalex.org/W2069825729,"Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of excess absorbed light energy is a fundamental process that regulates photosynthetic light harvesting in higher plants. Among several proposed NPQ mechanisms, aggregation-dependent quenching (ADQ) and charge transfer quenching have received the most attention. In vitro spectroscopic features of both mechanisms correlate with very similar signals detected in more intact systems and in vivo, where full NPQ can be observed. A major difference between the models is the proposed quenching site, which is predominantly the major trimeric light-harvesting complex II in ADQ and exclusively monomeric Lhcb proteins in charge transfer quenching. Here, we studied ADQ in both monomeric and trimeric Lhcb proteins, investigating the activities of each antenna subunit and their dependence on zeaxanthin, a major modulator of NPQ in vivo. We found that monomeric Lhcb proteins undergo stronger quenching than light-harvesting complex II during aggregation and that this is enhanced by binding to zeaxanthin, as occurs during NPQ in vivo. Finally, the analysis of Lhcb5 mutants showed that chlorophyll 612 and 613, in close contact with lutein bound at site L1, are important facilitators of ADQ."

Although the DNA sequence to which KLF4 binds is established, the mechanism by which KLF4 controls transcription is not well defined. Small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) is an important regulator of transcription. Here we show that KLF4 is both SUMOylated at a single lysine residue and physically interacts with SUMO-1 in a region that matches an acidic and hydrophobic residue-rich SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) consensus. The SIM in KLF4 is required for transactivation of target promoters in a SUMO-1-dependent manner. Mutation of either the acidic or hydrophobic residues in the SIM significantly impairs the ability of KLF4 to interact with SUMO-1, activate transcription, and inhibit cell proliferation. Our study provides direct evidence that SIM in KLF4 functions as a transcriptional activation domain. A survey of transcription factor sequences reveals that established transactivation domains of many transcription factors contain sequences highly related to SIM.

Eukaryotic gene transcription is controlled by transcription factors, which contain domains that recognize specific target DNA sequences. Transcription factors also contain distinct domains that regulate the transcriptional machinery by interacting with both general and specific transcription factors and regulators (1Triezenberg S.J.

There are two types of regulatory effects related to SUMO, non-covalent binding and covalent modification (5Sekiyama N. Ikegami T. Yamane T. Ikeguchi M. Uchimura Y. Baba D. Ariyoshi M. Tochio H.

For example, KLF4 transactivates the C/EBPβ and Lefty1 promoters to stimulate adipogenesis and embryonic stem cell self-renewal, respectively (22Nakatake Y. Fukui N. Iwamatsu Y. Masui S. Takahashi K.

Thus, identifying a common mechanism that regulates KLF4 transcriptional activity may aid in the development of novel therapeutic strategies against various disorders involving KLF4. Here, we report that KLF4 is both associated with SUMO-1 via a SIM and SUMOylated at a single site. The KLF4 SIM acts as a transcriptional activation domain in both yeast and mammalian systems, and SUMO-1 binding is crucial for this activity. Hence, SUMO can directly regulate transcription through a SIM. A survey of transcription factor sequences reveals that established transactivation domains of many transcription factors contain sequences that are highly related to SIM. Our study, therefore, identified a novel and perhaps common mechanism by which SUMO interaction modulates the transcriptional activity of transcription factors. Various SUMOylation and SIM mutants of KLF4 were constructed with QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, catalog #200521). Mammalian and yeast plasmids expressing GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4-DBD) and green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusion proteins were prepared by inserting cDNA fragments encoding wild type or mutated KLF4 sequences into the NcoI-EcoRI site of pGBKT7 (Clontech, catalog #630443) or the EcoRI-SalI site of pEGFPC1 (Clontech, catalog #6084-1). The amounts of plasmids were equally adjusted for transfection in all experiments. The plasmids GFP-SUMO-1, Myc-SUMO-1ΔGG, His-SUMO-1, FLAG-PIAS1, pMT3-KLF4, pMT3-KLF4-EEE, pMT3-KLF4-DDD, pCMV-Myc-KLF4, pLefty1-luc, and pGL3-C/EBPβ-luc (B3K) have been described previously, many of which were generously provided by other investigators (22Nakatake Y.

Briefly, COS-1 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and disrupted in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 135 mm NaCl, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma, catalog #1271) and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, catalog #11-836-153-001)) followed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting with the indicated antibodies, including rabbit Myc (Chemicon, catalog #06-549), mouse Myc (Sigma, clone 9E10, catalog #M4439), GFP (Roche Applied Science, catalog #1814460), and His (Qiagen, catalog #34660) antibodies. Alternatively, KLF4 was immunoprecipitated from cells with rabbit anti-KLF4 (Santa Cruz, H180, catalog #SC-20691) followed by Western blotting with mouse anti-GFP or either goat (Santa Cruz, M19, catalog #SC-1905) or rabbit anti-KLF4 (Santa Cruz, H180, catalog #SC-20691). To detect binding of SUMO-1 to the KLF4 SIM, HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated GFP-SIM fusion constructs, and lysates were prepared using lysis buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors (Active Motif, catalog #54001) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified recombinant GST-SUMO-1 (Biomol/Enzo Life Sciences, catalog #UW0160-0500) was incubated with the lysates overnight, and bovine serum albumin (BSA)-blocked glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Biosciences, catalog #17-0756-01) were then added. One hour later, the beads were washed twice with lysis buffer supplemented with 5% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mg/ml BSA and twice with wash buffer without BSA. The precipitates were blotted with mouse GFP (Roche Applied Science, catalog #1814460) and SUMO-1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., catalog #33-2400) antibodies. To detect binding of SUMO-1 to Myc-tagged KLF4, cells were transfected with the indicated KLF4 or mutant construct and lysed in the lysis buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors, and the supernatants were incubated with purified recombinant GST-SUMO-1 for 5 h. BSA-blocked glutathione-Sepharose beads were added for 1 h and then washed twice with lysis buffer supplemented with 5% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mg/ml BSA and twice with wash buffer without BSA. The precipitated proteins were detected with mouse anti-Myc and mouse anti-SUMO-1. To independently detect binding of SUMO-1 to KLF4, Klf4-null (Klf4−/−), mouse embryonic fibroblasts (39Hagos E.G. Ghaleb A.M. Dalton W.B. Bialkowska A.B. Yang V.W. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 1197-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) were co-transfected with the indicated KLF4 construct and Myc-tagged SUMO-1 lacking two carboxyl-terminal glycine residues that support SUMOylation (Myc-SUMO-1ΔGG). Three days later, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors (Active Motif, catalog #54001). The supernatant was incubated with a rabbit KLF4 antibody (H180, Santa Cruz), rocked for 5 h, and followed by incubation with BSA/salmon sperm DNA-blocked protein A beads (Upstate Biotechnology, catalog #16-157) overnight. The immune complexes were washed 3 times with lysis buffer supplemented with 5% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mg/ml BSA and twice with lysis buffer without BSA. The immunoprecipitates were probed with mouse anti-Myc and rabbit anti-KLF4. Twenty μg of His6-tagged SIM or mutant peptide (GenScript, Peptide Services) was mixed with either 5 μg of purified human SUMO-1 (LAE Biotechnology, catalog #P012) in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) or buffer alone as a control and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Fifteen mm imidazole was then added followed by incubation with 40 μl of BSA-blocked His-Select Nickel Affinity Gel (Sigma, catalog #P6611) for 15 min. The beads were washed 6 times for 10, 10, 5, 2, 1, and 1 min sequentially with binding buffer containing progressively reduced amounts of imidazole and subjected to immunoblotting with a mouse SUMO-1 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 was transformed with plasmid pGBKT7 (Clontech) or pGBKT7 inserted with the indicated SIM or SIM mutants and streaked on synthetic dropout medium lacking either adenine or both adenine and histidine to test transactivation of adenine (Ade) and histidine (His) reporters. Alternatively, strain Y187 was transformed with the indicated SIM or mutant constructs and cultured in liquid synthetic dropout medium lacking tryptophan. A colorimetric α-galactosidase assay was performed as instructed (Clontech, Yeast Protocols Handbook, PT3024-1) with the medium, which contained secreted α-galactosidase expressed from MEL1 reporter, with p-nitrophenyl-α-d-galactoside as the substrate. In addition, cells were lysed by glass bead disruption and immunoblotted with a mouse Myc antibody to detect GAL4-DBD-Myc-SIM fusion proteins. Both GAL4-DBD and fusion proteins expressed from the pGBKT7 vector contain a Myc tag near their carboxyl terminus (Clontech). To determine transcriptional activity of wild type KLF4 and a hydrophobic core SIM mutant in mammalian cells, 0.1 μg of pCMV-Script, pCMV-Myc-KLF4, or pCMV-Myc-KLF4-L101A/I106A (LI) was co-transfected into HEK293T cells with 0.4 μg of pLefty1-luc plus 2 ng of control renilla luciferase plasmid (for Lefty1 reporter) or with 0.25 μg of pGL3-C/EBPβ-luciferase plus 4 ng of renilla luciferase plasmid (for C/EBPβ reporter). Alternatively, pCMV-Myc-KLF4 was substituted with pMT3-KLF4 or the corresponding pMT3-KLF4-EEE or pMT3-KLF4-DDD mutant to detect the transcriptional activity of KLF4 SIM acidic stretch mutants. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) against SUMO-1, in the form of either a mixture of two siRNAs targeting different regions of SUMO-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog #SC-29498), two individual siRNAs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, #SC-29498a or #SC-29498b), or a Universal Negative Control siRNA (Invitrogen, catalog #12935300) (40Nandan M.O.

On the next day, 0.1 μg of pCMV-Script or pCMV-Myc-KLF4 was co-transfected in the cells with 0.4 μg of pLefty1-luc plus 2 ng of renilla luciferase control (for Lefty1 reporter) or with 0.25 μg of pGL3-C/EBPβ-luc plus 4 ng of renilla luciferase control (for C/EBPβ reporter) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, catalog #11668-019). Two days posttransfection, dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega, catalog #E1960) was conducted, and a portion of the lysate was immunoblotted with a mouse antibody against SUMO-1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., catalog #33-2400), SUMO-2/3 (MBL, clone 1E7, catalog #M114-3), ubiquitin (Santa Cruz, clone P4D1, catalog #SC-8017), or β-actin (Sigma, clone AC15, catalog #A1978). siRNA against SUMO-1 or the Universal Negative Control siRNA was transfected into 40% confluent HEK293T cells with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX. Three days later, total RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen; catalog #15596-018), and quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed in triplicate with primer sets specific for human SUMO-1, C/EBPβ, Lefty1, and the control gene β-actin (Qiagen; QT00014280, QT00237580, QT01667421, and QT00095431). Products were amplified and detected with Power SYBR Green RNA-to-CT 1-Step kit (Applied Biosystems; catalog #4389986) on an Eppendorf REALPLEX epgradient S real-time PCR Mastercycler according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative changes in expression were calculated based on the CT (−ΔΔCT) method after normalization with the actin control. Reactions without the reverse transcriptase (-RT Enzyme mix) were also performed as negative controls. The cycloheximide chase assay was performed as described (81Liu R. Zheng H.Q. Zhou Z. Dong J.T.

Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with either pCMV-Myc-KLF4 or pCMV-Myc-KLF4-K275R, treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, and lysed at the indicated time points. Total proteins were subjected to Western blotting for Myc (Sigma, 9E10, catalog #M4439) and β-actin (Sigma, AC15, catalog #A1978). The chemiluminescence signals were quantitatively measured with a Typhoon 9200 Variable Mode Imager from GE Healthcare and normalized with the β-actin control. The assay was performed as previously described (41Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were split to 30% confluence and transfected with the indicated plasmids. Cells were then labeled for 24 h with BrdU, fixed with methanol, and treated with HCl to denature the DNA. Cells were stained for immunofluorescence with mouse anti-BrdU (BD Pharmingen, clone 3D4, catalog #555627) and rabbit Myc (Chemicon) or KLF4 (H180, Santa Cruz) antibodies. Cells were also stained with Hoechst dye to reveal nuclei. KLF4 contains a highly conserved sequence that resembles the SM, ψKXE (7Gill G. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1998-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). We first determined whether KLF4 is SUMOylated within this motif. COS-1 cells were co-transfected with expression constructs containing Myc-tagged KLF4 (Myc-KLF4) and GFP-tagged SUMO-1 (GFP-SUMO-1), and cell lysates were prepared in the presence of a deSUMOylation inhibitor, N-ethylmaleimide (7Gill G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 536-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Myc-KLF4 was immunoprecipitated from the lysates with a rabbit Myc antibody followed by Western blotting with a mouse Myc or GFP antibody. As seen in Fig. 1B, a single Myc-KLF4 species was detected at ∼130 kDa (lane 1; asterisk). This form was SUMOylated as confirmed by blotting with the GFP antibody (lane 4; asterisk). The size of the protein is consistent with conjugation of a single GFP-SUMO-1 molecule (∼45-kDa apparent molecular mass) to Myc-KLF4 (65-kDa apparent molecular mass), taking into account a slowed migration due to the branching effect seen in SUMOylated proteins upon conjugation of SUMO near the center of the protein (38Du J.X.

Chem. 2006; 281: 33008-33018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As an alternative method to detect SUMOylation, we co-transfected COS-1 cells with Myc-KLF4 and His-tagged SUMO-1 followed by immunoprecipitation of Myc-KLF4. Upon Western blotting with Myc and His antibodies, SUMOylated Myc-KLF4 at ∼90 kDa was apparent in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 8; arrowheads). Because of the smaller size of the His tag, His-SUMO-1 (∼18 kDa) conjugated to Myc-KLF4 migrated faster than the GFP-SUMO-1-modified counterpart. These results confirm that KLF4 is SUMOylated. We next attempted to identify the SUMOylation site within KLF4. The lysine residue within the putative KLF4 SUMOylation motif is located at amino acid position 275 of the mouse sequence (Fig. 1A). We substituted arginine for this lysine and determined the effect of the K275R mutation on the ability of KLF4 to become SUMOylated. The SUMOylated form (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 5; arrow) was completely absent from cells transfected with Myc-KLF4-K275R (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 7), indicating that Lys-275 is the site of SUMOylation. Reinforcing this conclusion, loss in SUMOylation was fully reproduced by mutating the conserved glutamate residue within the ψKXE SUMOylation motif, Glu-277, as the E277G mutant could not be SUMOylated (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 8). In contrast, the K273R mutant, which contains a mutation at a nearby lysine residue 273, was SUMOylatable (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 6). Lending further support, SUMOylation was revealed when untagged KLF4 was co-transfected with GFP-SUMO-1 into COS-1 cells, immunoprecipitated with a KLF4 antibody, and probed with a GFP antibody (Fig. 1D, lane 1; asterisk). Again, the SUMOylated form of KLF4 was absent when the Lys-275 SUMOylation site was mutated to arginine (Fig. 1D, lane 2). These results demonstrate that the KLF4 SUMOylation motif represents a bona fide site of SUMOylation. In addition to the consensus SM between residues 274 and 277, an inverted SM (EPKP) is located between residues 382 and 385 in mouse KLF4 sequence (supplemental Fig. 1C). However, lysine 384 was SUMOylated, as KLF4 with a mutation at this site (K384R) was SUMOylated normally (supplemental Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 5), but an additional mutation at Lys-275 (K275R/K384R) completely abolished SUMOylation (supplemental Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 6). Moreover, other conserved lysine residues within the amino terminus (residues 1–100) and carboxyl-terminal zinc finger DNA binding domain (residues 350–483) of KLF4 were not SUMOylated (data not shown). Thus, multiple lines of evidence identified lysine residue 275 in the mouse KLF4 as the sole site of SUMOylation. Although KLF4 is SUMOylated and mutations in the consensus SUMOylation motif block this activity, neither the K275R nor the E277G mutant showed gross alternation in nuclear localization or transcriptional activity with various target promoter reporters (data not shown). This could be attributed to the relatively small fraction of KLF4 that is SUMOylated at any given time (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). SUMOylation did not affect the stability of KLF4 as the protein level of neither the K275R nor E277G mutant in transfected cells was considerably different from that of wild type KLF4 (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 4 and 5 with lane 2). SUMO-1 co-expression did not reduce the level of either KLF4 (Fig. 2B, lane 2) or the SUMOylatable K273R mutant (Fig. 2B, lane 3). In contrast, although PIAS1, the proposed SUMO E3 ligase for KLF4 (46Kawai-Kowase K. Ohshima T. Matsui H. Tanaka T. Shimizu T. Iso T. Arai M. Owens G.K. Kurabayashi M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

https://openalex.org/W1975946030,"Background The phase II detoxification enzymes execute a major protective role against xenobiotics as well as endogenous toxicants. To understand how xenobiotics regulate phase II enzyme expression, acrylamide was selected as a model xenobiotic chemical, as it induces a large number and a variety of phase II enzymes, including numerous glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) in Caenorhabditis elegans. Methodology/Principal Findings To begin dissecting genetically xenobiotics response pathways (xrep), 24 independent mutants of C. elegans that exhibited abnormal GST expression or regulation against acrylamide were isolated by screening about 3.5×105 genomes of gst::gfp transgenic strains mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS). Complementation testing assigned the mutants to four different genes, named xrep-1, -2, -3, and -4. One of the genes, xrep-1, encodes WDR-23, a nematode homologue of WD repeat-containing protein WDR23. Loss-of-function mutations in xrep-1 mutants resulted in constitutive expression of many GSTs and other phase II enzymes in the absence of acrylamide, and the wild-type xrep-1 allele carried on a DNA construct successfully cured the mutant phenotype of the constitutive enzyme expression. Conclusions/Significance Genetic and cellular characterization of xrep-1 mutants suggest that a large number of GSTs and other phase II enzymes induced by acrylamide are under negative regulation by XREP-1 (WDR-23), which is likely to be a functional equivalent of mammalian Keap1 and a regulator of SKN-1, a C. elegans analogue of cap-n-collar Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2)."

CS chains are composed of the repeating disaccharide unit –GlcUA (d-glucuronic acid)-GalNAc-, whereas DS chains are composed of –IdoUA (l-iduronic acid)-GalNAc-, formed from precursor CS chains through the action of glucuronyl C5 epimerase (8Silbert J.E. Sugumaran G. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Structural elements of CS and DS are often found in co-polymeric hybrid chains (CS/DS), which tend to exhibit a periodic distribution of GlcUA-containing and IdoUA-containing disaccharide units in a tissue-specific manner (9Cheng F. Heinegård D. Malmström A. Schmidtchen A. Yoshida K. Fransson L.A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Sugahara K. Mikami T. Uyama T. Mizuguchi S. Nomura K.

Biol. 2007; 17: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In biosynthesis, CS, DS, and CS/DS chains are further modified by a number of sulfotransferases at C-2 of GlcUA/IdoUA and/or C-4 and/or C-6 of GalNAc to yield a broad range of related structures including specific patterns of sulfation within oligosaccharide sequences (12Sugahara K. Yamada S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotech. 2000; 12: 321-349Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, distinct functional domains of CS/DS chains may be generated in various tissues due to differential expression of modification enzymes. Such structural domains introduced into CS/DS chains in respective tissues may result in different responses to various CS/DS-binding proteins such as heparin-binding growth factors and cytokines (10Sugahara K.

However, such functional sequences with a CS/DS hybrid structure are not fully understood.We have shown that CS/DS chains from embryonic pig brain (E-CS/DS) and their mimicry by those from shark liver (SL-CS/DS) can recruit endogenous pleiotrophin (PTN) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and present them to cultured mouse hippocampal neurons to stimulate the outgrowth of neurites (19Bao X.

However, the E-CS/DS and SL-CS/DS preparations, although containing similar activity, differ in overall composition, as exemplified by their disaccharide compositions. A series of PTN-binding octasaccharides with unique structures have been isolated from embryonic pig brain (E-CS/DS). These were prepared by digestion with CSase B specific to IdoUA (21Bao X. Muramatsu T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35318-35328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that the isolated sequences, which lacked IdoUA, were flanked by two IdoUA residues within the CS/DS hybrid chains. Thus, the identification of unique PTN/HGF-binding sequences is likely to explain the presence of similar functional activity in the apparently structurally different E-CS/DS and SL-CS/DS chains.Recently characterized CS/DS chains from shark skin (SS-CS/DS) have a different composition from the E-CS/DS and SL-CS/DS chains, but strongly interact with various brain-expressed growth factors including PTN, and effectively promote neurite outgrowth (22Nandini C.D. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4058-4069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, SS-CS/DS, a potential candidate for a therapeutic agent, is an ideal material with which to identify functional domains. In this study, a novel PTN-binding hexasaccharide was isolated from the SS-CS/DS hybrid chains after digestion with chondroitinase AC-I and its strong binding with HGF was also demonstrated, suggesting that the PTN- and HGF-binding domains in SS-CS/DS overlap partially, if not completely. Intriguingly, the isolated hexasaccharide differed in disaccharide composition and sequence from the PTN-binding octasaccharides isolated from E-CS/DS (21Bao X. Muramatsu T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35318-35328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which prompted us to investigate the three-dimensional structure and electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution of the PTN-binding and non-binding sequences using methods previously reported for comparing multiple CS oligosaccharides recognized by monoclonal antibodies (23Blanchard V.

Computational chemistry using molecular modeling, simulation and ESP calculations revealed the three-dimensional structure and distribution of ESP on the molecular surface not only for the oligosaccharides but also for PTN, which allowed us to predict the binding pocket of the PTN molecule and gain new insights into the molecular mechanism by which the oligosaccharides are recognized by PTN.DISCUSSIONThe NOP activity of CS/DS chains is mediated by PTN and HGF (19Bao X.

The structural feature of the hexasaccharide isolated in this study is in complete agreement with the notion suggested by Deakin et al. (58Deakin J.A. Blaum B.S. Gallagher J.T. Uhrín D. Lyon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6311-6321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the light of their findings, however, it should be noted that our hexasaccharide does not represent the minimum size for the binding of HGF and possibly of PTN, and that more sulfated oligosaccharides are more likely to bind more strongly to the proteins. Presumably, the flexibility of the sugar chains afforded by the two IdoUA residues in our hexasaccharide are crucial for the binding to two different growth factors. Notably, however, the octasaccharide, ΔE-D-A-D, which do not contain IdoA, was revealed to have a very similar conformation and ESP map to those of its isomer ΔE-D-iA-D, and most likely can bind PTN, suggesting that IdoA is not always an essential factor for the binding to functional proteins. As discussed below, the molecular shape with the ESP surface is the structural basis or the entity for the “overall organization of functional GAG domains,” which has been discussed by Lindahl and colleagues (59Kreuger J. Spillmann D. Li J.P. Lindahl U. J. Cell. Biol. 2006; 174: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar).An IdoUA(2S) residue in the heparan sulfate of N-syndecan is essential for the binding of PTN and induction of neurite outgrowth (60Kinnunen T. Raulo E. Nolo R. Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2243-2248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). iB units containing IdoUA(2S) are abundant in CS/DS chains from the developing mouse cerebellum (61Mitsunaga C. Mikami T. Mizumoto S. Fukuda J. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18942-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and play a key role in the PTN-binding and NOP activities of CS/DS chains from embryonic pig brain (19Bao X. Mikami T. Yamada S. Faissner A. Muramatsu T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9180-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and shark liver (20Li F. Shetty A.K. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2956-2966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that CS/DS chains containing iB units may exert neuritogenic activity by recruiting PTN and mimicking the activity of heparan sulfate of N-syndecan. The identification of the PTN-binding hexasaccharide ΔA-iB-iB in this study directly demonstrated the critical role of the iB unit in the interaction with PTN. HGF binds to and activates the tyrosine kinase receptor cMet, and is also a versatile signal for developing neurons (62Maina F. Klein R. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). GAGs are essential co-receptors for the activation of cMet (63Deakin J.A. Lyon M. J. Cell. Sci. 1999; 112: 1999-2009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our study using primary mouse hippocampal cells showed that SL-CS/DS hybrid chains recruited endogenous HGF to stimulate the outgrowth of neurites of hippocampal neurons probably through cMet (20Li F. Shetty A.K. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2956-2966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that heparin and heparin oligosaccharides stimulate the production of HGF at the post-translational level (64Matsumoto K. Tajima H. Okazaki H. Nakamura T. J. Biochem. 1993; 114: 820-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 65Sakiyama R. Fukuta K. Matsumoto K. Furukawa M. Takahashi Y. Nakamura T. J. Biochem. 2007; 141: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), suggesting an additional possibility, that SS-CS/DS and ΔA-iB-iB also possess the HGF-inducing activity.Because the requirement of IdoUA(2S) differed between previous (57Catlow K.R. Deakin J.A. Wei Z. Delehedde M. Fernig D.G. Gherardi E. Gallagher J.T. Pavão M.S. Lyon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5235-5248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and the present findings and the structure of ΔA-iB-iB also looked different from that of a series of previously isolated D-unit-containing octasaccharides (21Bao X. Muramatsu T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35318-35328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that the PTN-binding sequences must have a similar three-dimensional structure and electronic properties. Thus, in this study, the oligosaccharide-binding site in PTN was predicted by deriving the three-dimensional structure and the electrostatic features of the ESP distributions. This was carried out not only for the five oligosaccharides (ΔA-iB-iB, ΔE-D-A-D, ΔE-D-iA-D, ΔC-C-A-C, and ΔC-A-A-A), but also for PTN using advanced computational methods including homology modeling with amino acid sequence alignment, energy minimization with a hydration effect by molecular mechanics, and full geometry optimization with a solvent effect by DFT. This provided additional information on the structure and electronic properties of the octasaccharides as reported previously (24Pothacharoen P. Kalayanamitra K. Deepa S.S. Fukui S. Hattori T. Fukushima N. Hardingham T. Kongtawelert P. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35232-35246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8 and supplemental Fig. S5, the ESP distributions of the PTN-binding oligosaccharides were clearly different particularly at the non-reducing ends from those of the non-binding oligosaccharides. It seems that PTN recognizes the features identified by the ESP shapes of the oligosaccharides having disulfated disaccharide units such as iB, D, and ΔE (also see the first paragraph of the “Discussion”). In addition, the ESP analysis demonstrated that the negative iso-surface is spread in restricted areas surrounding the sulfate groups of a disulfated disaccharide(s). The ESP distributions in the five isolated oligosaccharides showed features likely to enable electrostatic interactions with proteins or monoclonal antibodies, focusing on the spatial distribution of the electronegative zones and as exemplified by the recognition of the octasaccharides by the anti-CS monoclonal antibodies (23Blanchard V.

Yamada S. Fukui S. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 631-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Previously, we showed that two analogous octasaccharide sequences ΔD-C-C-C and ΔC-C-A-D, but not another one ΔC-A-D-C, were recognized by the monoclonal antibody WF6 (24Pothacharoen P. Kalayanamitra K. Deepa S.S. Fukui S. Hattori T. Fukushima N. Hardingham T. Kongtawelert P. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35232-35246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It seems, however, in the present case, the number and localization of sulfate groups as well as the flexible IdoUA appear to be more crucial factors for the electrostatic surface. Yet, this study still provided additional important information on the electronic profiles such as shapes and spreading pattern of the electronegative zone, which are caused by the positions of sulfate and carboxyl groups in the conformation of oligosaccharides.PTN, also known as heparin-binding growth-associated molecule, binds to heparin-type glycans as well to regulate the neurite extension and plasticity of hippocampal neurons (68Raulo E. Tumova S. Pavlov I. Pekkanen M. Hienola A. Klankki E. Kalkkinen N. Taira T. Kilpelaïnen I. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41576-41583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The minimum size of the PTN-binding site of heparin has been reported to be a 12–16-mer (69Fath M. VanderNoot V. Kilpeläinen I. Kinnunen T. Rauvala H. Linhardt R.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this study, the PTN affinity chromatography of SS-CS/DS-H-derived oligosaccharides showed that the 6–10-mer fractions retained the capacity to bind PTN but their affinity was weaker than that of the undigested polysaccharide chains, and 12-mer was the minimum oligosaccharide with affinity comparable with that of the parental polysaccharides. This may imply that in addition to a PTN-binding core oligosaccharide such as ΔΑ-iB-iB, extended sugar residues are required for maximal interaction with PTN as in the case of heparan sulfate (68Raulo E. Tumova S. Pavlov I. Pekkanen M. Hienola A. Klankki E. Kalkkinen N. Taira T. Kilpelaïnen I. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41576-41583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether heparan sulfate-type and CS/DS-type oligosaccharides bind to the same pocket of PTN, and if there is significant similarity in the three-dimensional structure and electronic properties between the two types of oligosaccharides.This study also showed that SS-CS/DS is a potential candidate for a therapeutic agent as the expression of PTN, the related protein midkine, and HGF is increased in various human tumors, making them promising as targets for tumor therapy (34Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Sakai K. Nakamura T. Proteomics. 2008; 8: 3360-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 46Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Importantly, the structural identification of the common sugar-binding domain for PTN and HGF as well as the sugar counterpart by the methods used here has provided a fundamental structural platform for the drug design of sugar or non-sugar small molecules, which may avoid any side effects of the parental polysaccharides. The obvious next step of this computational study is a docking simulation experiment of the protein and the corresponding sugar sequence(s).

CS chains are composed of the repeating disaccharide unit –GlcUA (d-glucuronic acid)-GalNAc-, whereas DS chains are composed of –IdoUA (l-iduronic acid)-GalNAc-, formed from precursor CS chains through the action of glucuronyl C5 epimerase (8Silbert J.E. Sugumaran G. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Structural elements of CS and DS are often found in co-polymeric hybrid chains (CS/DS), which tend to exhibit a periodic distribution of GlcUA-containing and IdoUA-containing disaccharide units in a tissue-specific manner (9Cheng F. Heinegård D. Malmström A. Schmidtchen A. Yoshida K. Fransson L.A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Sugahara K. Mikami T. Uyama T. Mizuguchi S. Nomura K.

Biol. 2007; 17: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In biosynthesis, CS, DS, and CS/DS chains are further modified by a number of sulfotransferases at C-2 of GlcUA/IdoUA and/or C-4 and/or C-6 of GalNAc to yield a broad range of related structures including specific patterns of sulfation within oligosaccharide sequences (12Sugahara K. Yamada S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotech. 2000; 12: 321-349Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, distinct functional domains of CS/DS chains may be generated in various tissues due to differential expression of modification enzymes. Such structural domains introduced into CS/DS chains in respective tissues may result in different responses to various CS/DS-binding proteins such as heparin-binding growth factors and cytokines (10Sugahara K.

However, such functional sequences with a CS/DS hybrid structure are not fully understood.We have shown that CS/DS chains from embryonic pig brain (E-CS/DS) and their mimicry by those from shark liver (SL-CS/DS) can recruit endogenous pleiotrophin (PTN) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and present them to cultured mouse hippocampal neurons to stimulate the outgrowth of neurites (19Bao X.

Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2956-2966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the E-CS/DS and SL-CS/DS preparations, although containing similar activity, differ in overall composition, as exemplified by their disaccharide compositions. A series of PTN-binding octasaccharides with unique structures have been isolated from embryonic pig brain (E-CS/DS). These were prepared by digestion with CSase B specific to IdoUA (21Bao X. Muramatsu T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35318-35328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that the isolated sequences, which lacked IdoUA, were flanked by two IdoUA residues within the CS/DS hybrid chains. Thus, the identification of unique PTN/HGF-binding sequences is likely to explain the presence of similar functional activity in the apparently structurally different E-CS/DS and SL-CS/DS chains.Recently characterized CS/DS chains from shark skin (SS-CS/DS) have a different composition from the E-CS/DS and SL-CS/DS chains, but strongly interact with various brain-expressed growth factors including PTN, and effectively promote neurite outgrowth (22Nandini C.D. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4058-4069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, SS-CS/DS, a potential candidate for a therapeutic agent, is an ideal material with which to identify functional domains. In this study, a novel PTN-binding hexasaccharide was isolated from the SS-CS/DS hybrid chains after digestion with chondroitinase AC-I and its strong binding with HGF was also demonstrated, suggesting that the PTN- and HGF-binding domains in SS-CS/DS overlap partially, if not completely. Intriguingly, the isolated hexasaccharide differed in disaccharide composition and sequence from the PTN-binding octasaccharides isolated from E-CS/DS (21Bao X. Muramatsu T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35318-35328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which prompted us to investigate the three-dimensional structure and electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution of the PTN-binding and non-binding sequences using methods previously reported for comparing multiple CS oligosaccharides recognized by monoclonal antibodies (23Blanchard V.

Computational chemistry using molecular modeling, simulation and ESP calculations revealed the three-dimensional structure and distribution of ESP on the molecular surface not only for the oligosaccharides but also for PTN, which allowed us to predict the binding pocket of the PTN molecule and gain new insights into the molecular mechanism by which the oligosaccharides are recognized by PTN."
https://openalex.org/W2105986546,"The polyneuropathy of juvenile Greyhound show dogs shows clinical similarities to the genetically heterogeneous Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease in humans. The pedigrees containing affected dogs suggest monogenic autosomal recessive inheritance and all affected dogs trace back to a single male. Here, we studied the neuropathology of this disease and identified a candidate causative mutation. Peripheral nerve biopsies from affected dogs were examined using semi-thin histology, nerve fibre teasing and electron microscopy. A severe chronic progressive mixed polyneuropathy was observed. Seven affected and 17 related control dogs were genotyped on the 50k canine SNP chip. This allowed us to localize the causative mutation to a 19.5 Mb interval on chromosome 13 by homozygosity mapping. The NDRG1 gene is located within this interval and NDRG1 mutations have been shown to cause hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy-Lom in humans (CMT4D). Therefore, we considered NDRG1 a positional and functional candidate gene and performed mutation analysis in affected and control Greyhounds. A 10 bp deletion in canine NDRG1 exon 15 (c.1080_1089delTCGCCTGGAC) was perfectly associated with the polyneuropathy phenotype of Greyhound show dogs. The deletion causes a frame shift (p.Arg361SerfsX60) which alters several amino acids before a stop codon is encountered. A reduced level of NDRG1 transcript could be detected by RT-PCR. Western blot analysis demonstrated an absence of NDRG1 protein in peripheral nerve biopsy of an affected Greyhound. We thus have identified a candidate causative mutation for polyneuropathy in Greyhounds and identified the first genetically characterized canine CMT model which offers an opportunity to gain further insights into the pathobiology and therapy of human NDRG1 associated CMT disease. Selection against this mutation can now be used to eliminate polyneuropathy from Greyhound show dogs."
https://openalex.org/W1990756584,"Passive exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is estimated to exert a major burden of disease. Currently, numerous countries have taken legal actions to protect the population against ETS. Numerous studies have been conducted in this field. Therefore, scientometric methods should be used to analyze the accumulated data since there is no such approach available so far.A combination of scientometric methods and novel visualizing procedures were used, including density-equalizing mapping and radar charting techniques. 6,580 ETS-related studies published between 1900 and 2008 were identified in the ISI database. Using different scientometric approaches, a continuous increase of both quantitative and qualitative parameters was found. The combination with density-equalizing calculations demonstrated a leading position of the United States (2,959 items published) in terms of quantitative research activities. Charting techniques demonstrated that there are numerous bi- and multilateral networks between different countries and institutions in this field. Again, a leading position of American institutions was found.This is the first comprehensive scientometric analysis of data on global scientific activities in the field of environmental tobacco smoke research. The present findings can be used as a benchmark for funding allocation processes."
https://openalex.org/W2064979841,"The transcription factor TonEBP/OREBP promotes cell survival during osmotic stress. High NaCl-induced phosphorylation of TonEBP/OREBP at tyrosine-143 was known to be an important factor in increasing its activity in cell culture. We now find that TonEBP/OREBP also is phosphorylated at tyrosine-143 in rat renal inner medulla, dependent on the interstitial osmolality. c-Abl seemed likely to be the kinase that phosphorylates TonEBP/OREBP because Y143 is in a consensus c-Abl phosphorylation site. We now confirm that, as follows. High NaCl increases c-Abl activity. Specific inhibition of c-Abl by imatinib, siRNA, or c-Abl kinase dead drastically reduces high NaCl-induced TonEBP/OREBP activity by reducing its nuclear location and transactivating activity. c-Abl associates with TonEBP/OREBP (coimmunoprecipitation) and phosphorylates TonEBP/OREBP-Y143 both in cell and in vitro. High NaCl-induced activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated, previously known to contribute to activation of TonEBP/OREBP, depends on c-Abl activity. Thus, c-Abl is the kinase responsible for high NaCl-induced phosphorylation of TonEBP/OREBP-Y143, which contributes to its increased activity."
https://openalex.org/W2084214087,"SHB (Src homology 2 domain-containing adapter protein B) is involved in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Mice deficient in the Shb gene have been found to exhibit a transmission ratio distortion with respect to inheritance of the Shb null allele among offspring and this phenomenon was linked to female gamete production. Consequently, we postulated that Shb plays a role for oocyte biology and thus decided to investigate oocyte formation, meiotic maturation, and early embryo development in relation to absence of the Shb gene. Oogenesis was apparently accelerated judging from the stages of oocyte development on fetal day 18.5 and one week postnatally in Shb -/- mice; but in adulthood ovarian follicle maturation was impaired in these mice. Completion of meiosis I (first polar body extrusion) was less synchronized, with a fraction of oocytes showing premature polar body extrusion in the absence of Shb. In vitro fertilization of mature oocytes isolated from Shb +/+, +/- and -/- mice revealed impaired early embryo development in the -/- embryos. Moreover, the absence of Shb enhanced ERK (extracellular-signal regulated kinase) and RSK (ribosomal S6 kinase) signaling in oocytes and these effects were paralleled by an increased ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation and activation. It is concluded that SHB regulates normal oocyte and follicle development and that perturbation of SHB signaling causes defective meiosis I and early embryo development."

Critically short telomeres are associated with disease, aging and cancer. Defects in telomere replication can lead to telomere loss, which can be prevented by telomerase-mediated telomere elongation or activities of the Werner syndrome helicase/exonuclease protein (WRN). Both telomerase and WRN attenuate cytotoxicity induced by the environmental carcinogen hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), which promotes replication stress and DNA polymerase arrest. However, it is not known whether Cr(VI)-induced replication stress impacts telomere integrity. Here we report that Cr(VI) exposure of human fibroblasts induced telomeric damage as indicated by phosphorylated H2AX (gammaH2AX) at telomeric foci. The induced gammaH2AX foci occurred in S-phase cells, which is indicative of replication fork stalling or collapse. Telomere fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of metaphase chromosomes revealed that Cr(VI) exposure induced an increase in telomere loss and sister chromatid fusions that were rescued by telomerase activity. Human cells depleted for WRN protein exhibited a delayed reduction in telomeric and non-telomeric damage, indicated by gammaH2AX foci, during recovery from Cr(VI) exposure, consistent with WRN roles in repairing damaged replication forks. Telomere FISH of chromosome spreads revealed that WRN protects against Cr(VI)-induced telomere loss and downstream chromosome fusions, but does not prevent chromosome fusions that retain telomere sequence at the fusion point. Our studies indicate that environmentally induced replication stress leads to telomere loss and aberrations that are suppressed by telomerase-mediated telomere elongation or WRN functions in replication fork restoration."
https://openalex.org/W2066410284,"Tmub1 (C7orf21/HOPS) encodes a protein containing a ubiquitin-like domain. Tmub1 is highly expressed in the nervous system. To study its physiological function, we generated mice with Tmub1 deleted by homologous recombination. The knockout mice were grossly normal and viable. In a comprehensive behavioral testing battery, the only knockout phenotype displayed was a strong increase in home cage locomotor activity during the dark phase (subjective day) of the light:dark (L:D) cycle. There were no changes in activity during the light period. There were no changes in locomotor activity observed in other assays, e.g. novel open-field. The increase in dark phase locomotor activity persisted during a seven day D:D (complete darkness) challenge, and remained largely confined to the normally dark period. Telemetric recording in freely moving subjects for one 24 hr L:D cycle, revealed the same increase in locomotor activity in the dark phase. In addition, EEG analysis showed that the knockout mice exhibited increased waking and decreased NREM & REM times during the dark phase, but the EEG was otherwise normal. Using lacZ as a reporter we found Tmub1 expression prominent in a few brain structures including the thalamus, a region known to drive wakefulness and arousal via its projections to the cortex. We identified calcium modulating cyclophilin ligand CAMLG/CAML as a binding partner by a yeast two-hybrid screen of a brain library. The interaction of Tmub1 and CAMLG was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays in HEK cells. The two proteins were also found to be co-localized to the cytoplasm when expressed in HEK cells. Both Tmub1 and CAMLG have been recently described in the regulation of membrane trafficking of specific receptors. Taken together our results implicate Tmub1 in the regulation of locomotor activity and wakefulness and suggest that Tmub1 binds to and functions together with CAMLG."
https://openalex.org/W2148028865,"A previously engineered Methanocaldococcus jannaschii tRNA(CUA Tyr)-tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase pair orthogonal to Escherichia coli was modified to become orthogonal in mammalian cells. The resulting tRNA(CUA Tyr)-tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase pair was able to suppress an amber codon in the green fluorescent protein, GFP, and in a foldon protein in mammalian cells. The methodology reported here will allow rapid transformation of the much larger collection of existing tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases that were already evolved for the incorporation of an array of over 50 unnatural amino acids into proteins in Escherichia coli into proteins in mammalian cells. Thus we will be able to introduce a large array of possibilities for protein modifications in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2095488102,"Inflammation promotes granulopoiesis over B lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM). We studied B cell homeostasis in two murine models of T cell mediated chronic inflammation, namely calreticulin-deficient fetal liver chimeras (FLC), which develop severe blepharitis and alopecia due to T cell hyper responsiveness, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) caused by injection of CD4(+) naïve T cells into lymphopenic mice. We show herein that despite the severe depletion of B cell progenitors during chronic, peripheral T cell-mediated inflammation, the population of BM mature recirculating B cells is unaffected. These B cells are poised to differentiate to plasma cells in response to blood borne pathogens, in an analogous fashion to non-recirculating marginal zone (MZ) B cells in the spleen. MZ B cells nevertheless differentiate more efficiently to plasma cells upon polyclonal stimulation by Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, and are depleted during chronic T cell mediated inflammation in vivo. The preservation of mature B cells in the BM is associated with increased concentration of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in serum and BM plasma. MIF produced by perivascular dendritic cells (DC) in the BM provides a crucial survival signal for recirculating B cells, and mice treated with a MIF inhibitor during inflammation showed significantly reduced mature B cells in the BM. These data indicate that MIF secretion by perivascular DC may promote the survival of the recirculating B cell pool to ensure responsiveness to blood borne microbes despite loss of the MZ B cell pool that accompanies depressed lymphopoiesis during inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1979635744,"Biological data, and particularly annotation data, are increasingly being represented in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, while relevant biological information is implicit in the links between multiple domains, annotations from these different domains are usually represented in distinct, unconnected DAGs, making links between the domains represented difficult to determine. We develop a novel family of general statistical tests for the discovery of strong associations between two directed acyclic graphs. Our method takes the topology of the input graphs and the specificity and relevance of associations between nodes into consideration. We apply our method to the extraction of associations between biomedical ontologies in an extensive use-case. Through a manual and an automatic evaluation, we show that our tests discover biologically relevant relations. The suite of statistical tests we develop for this purpose is implemented and freely available for download."
