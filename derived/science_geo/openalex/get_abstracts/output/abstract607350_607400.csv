https://openalex.org/W2792937385,"Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels by endothelial cells (ECs), is an adaptive response to oxygen/nutrient deprivation orchestrated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) upon ischemia or exercise. Hypoxia is the best-understood trigger of VEGF expression via the transcription factor HIF1α. Nutrient deprivation is inseparable from hypoxia during ischemia, yet its role in angiogenesis is poorly characterized. Here, we identified sulfur amino acid restriction as a proangiogenic trigger, promoting increased VEGF expression, migration and sprouting in ECs in vitro, and increased capillary density in mouse skeletal muscle in vivo via the GCN2/ATF4 amino acid starvation response pathway independent of hypoxia or HIF1α. We also identified a requirement for cystathionine-γ-lyase in VEGF-dependent angiogenesis via increased hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production. H2S mediated its proangiogenic effects in part by inhibiting mitochondrial electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in increased glucose uptake and glycolytic ATP production."

Survival depends on fulfilling salient needs in a changing environment. Formative behavioral observations highlighted the remarkable ability of individuals across species to adaptively respond to dynamic physiological and environmental challenges (Pavlov and Folʹbort, 1926Pavlov, I.P., and Folʹbort, G.V. (1926). Die höchste Nerventätigkeit (das Verhalten) von Tieren. Eine zwanzigjährige Prüfung der objektiven Forschung ; Bedingte Reflexe. Sammlung von Artikeln, Berichten, Vorlesungen und Reden, 3. Aufl., übers. von G. Volbroth, ed. (München: J. F. Bergmann).Google Scholar, Tinbergen, 1951Tinbergen N. The Study of Instinct. Oxford University Press, 1951Google Scholar). Given these insights, it is surprising that the neural and molecular mechanisms governing the prioritization of adaptive behaviors remain elusive. While great strides have been made in understanding how individual need states such as hunger, thirst, fear, and pain are signaled in the brain, relatively little is known about how the brain prioritizes such needs. Pain is a natural response to injury, but long-term inflammation and associated pain can be maladaptive. While acute pain is reflexive in that it is triggered by activation of primary sensory neurons (i.e., nociceptors) in the periphery, inflammatory pain is mediated at least in part by central mechanisms (Coderre et al., 1990Coderre T.J. Vaccarino A.L. Melzack R. Central nervous system plasticity in the tonic pain response to subcutaneous formalin injection.Brain Res. 1990; 535: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). From this perspective, targeting central nociceptive pathways may be an effective way to selectively reduce inflammatory pain while leaving intact adaptive responses to acute pain. Because persistent pain remains a major public health burden that is not well-controlled by current analgesics (Loeser, 2012Loeser J.D. Relieving pain in America.Clin. J. Pain. 2012; 28: 185-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), identifying endogenous mechanisms that specifically reduce the inflammatory response to injury may provide strategies for the design of effective pain therapies. As a unique approach to identify neural circuits that regulate pain, we sought to explore competing need states that affect nociception. The response to pain is typically an adaptive mechanism that protects organisms against dangerous stimuli. However, as other physiological needs such as hunger increase, behavior must shift from avoiding bodily injury to fulfilling other immediate needs. Interactions between competing need states have been reported (e.g., acute stressors such as inescapable footshock, cold-water swims, or caloric deprivation can produce short-term analgesia) (Bodnar et al., 1977Bodnar R.J.

Additionally, hunger has been shown to influence adaptive behavioral responses to fear and anxiety (Burnett et al., 2016Burnett C.J. Li C. Webber E. Tsaousidou E. Xue S.Y. Brüning J.C. Krashes M.J.

Neurosci. 2016; 19: 734-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We reasoned that individuals must prioritize the most acute threat to survival and behave accordingly. To explore the behavioral, neural, and molecular mechanisms that rank survival needs, we examined the bidirectional interaction between hunger and different modalities of pain. Here, we found that hunger selectively inhibits both the behavioral response and affective properties of inflammatory pain. Because neurons responsive to hunger are well-characterized (Sternson and Eiselt, 2017Sternson S.M. Eiselt A.K. Three Pillars for the Neural Control of Appetite.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2017; 79: 401-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), they provide an entry point to examine the neural circuit intersection of hunger and pain. We discovered that hypothalamic agouti-related protein (AgRP)-expressing neurons that project to the hindbrain parabrachial nucleus (PBN) selectively inhibit responses to inflammatory pain. The analgesic effect of hunger on inflammatory pain is mediated by neuropeptide Y (NPY) signaling on NPY Y1 receptors in the PBN. We further show that acute thermal, but not inflammatory, pain inhibits the activity of AgRP neurons, demonstrating that central mechanisms prioritize the most salient threat. Taken together, our data demonstrate that AgRP neurons mediate the interaction between hunger and pain and have uncovered PBN NPY Y1 receptor signaling as a target for analgesia. To understand how competing survival signals are prioritized, we first explored how 24-hr food deprivation influences the behavioral response to pain induced by either chemical (formalin), thermal (52°C hotplate), or mechanical (Von Frey filament) insults (Figures 1A, 1H, and 1J ) (Bodnar et al., 1978aBodnar R.J.

Formalin paw injection is a reliable and widely used model of nociception with high face validity when tested with analgesic drugs (Hunskaar and Hole, 1987Hunskaar S. Hole K. The formalin test in mice: dissociation between inflammatory and non-inflammatory pain.Pain. 1987; 30: 103-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar). Formalin induces distinct acute (0–5 min) and long-term inflammatory (15–45 min) phases of pain (Dubuisson and Dennis, 1977Dubuisson D. Dennis S.G. The formalin test: a quantitative study of the analgesic effects of morphine, meperidine, and brain stem stimulation in rats and cats.Pain. 1977; 4: 161-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar), while responses to a hotplate or Von Frey filaments are acute and transient. We discovered that 24-hr food deprivation attenuated the duration (Figures 1B–1D) and frequency (Figure 1E) of inflammatory paw licking after injection of a noxious chemical stimulus, similar to the effect of an anti-inflammatory painkiller (Hunskaar and Hole, 1987Hunskaar S. Hole K. The formalin test in mice: dissociation between inflammatory and non-inflammatory pain.Pain. 1987; 30: 103-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar) (Figures S1A–S1E). Conversely, food deprivation had no effect on the acute phase response to formalin injection (Figures 1F and 1G) or the response to acute thermal (Figures 1H and 1I) or mechanical (Figures 1J and 1K) pain, unlike an opioid painkiller (Figures S1F–S1H). These data demonstrate that hunger selectively blocks inflammatory phase pain responses.Figure S1Anti-inflammatory and Opiate Drug Administration Reduce Responses to Inflammatory Phase and Thermal Pain, Respectively, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Experimental timeline for effects of an anti-inflammatory analgesic (ketoprofen) on the formalin test.(B) Inflammatory phase formalin-induced paw licking (time) in i.p. saline- (n = 5) and ketoprofen- (n = 6) treated mice (unpaired t test, p < 0.01).(C) Inflammatory phase formalin-induced lick bouts in saline- and ketoprofen-treated mice (unpaired t test, p < 0.01).(D) Acute phase formalin-induced paw licking (time) in saline- and ketoprofen-treated mice (unpaired t test, p = ns).(E) Acute phase formalin-induced lick bouts in saline- and ketoprofen-treated mice (unpaired t test, p = ns).(F) Experimental timeline for effects of morphine on the hotplate test.(G) Latency to paw withdrawal from 52°C hotplate before and 30 min post i.p. saline injection (paired t test, p = ns).(H) Latency to paw withdrawal from hotplate before and 30 min post i.p. morphine injection (paired t test, p < 0.01).(I) Experimental design: 24 h food deprived mice were injected with saline or formalin in their hindpaw and change in paw circumference was measured 30 min post-injection.(J) Change in paw circumference in food deprived saline- (n = 6) and formalin- (n = 9) injected mice (unpaired t test, p < 0.01).Data are expressed as mean ± SEM, ns p > 0.05, t tests: ∗∗p < 0.01.

See also Table S2. To determine whether hunger influences inflammation-induced sensitization to different modalities of pain, we next induced a persistent inflammatory response in the paw via injection of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) (Marchand et al., 2005Marchand F. Perretti M. McMahon S.B. Role of the immune system in chronic pain.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). After paw injection of CFA, mice exhibit sensitization to both mechanical (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2E ) and thermal (Figures 2G and 2H) stimuli. The sensitization to both of these stimuli is abolished in food-restricted mice (Figures 2C, 2D, 2F, and 2I), suggesting that hunger reduces inflammation-induced sensitization to thermal and mechanical pain. Taken together, these data suggest that hunger is a powerful suppressant of inflammatory pain response. Pain results in both behavioral responses as well as negative affect, the latter of which has been modeled in rodents using classic conditioning paradigms (Deyama et al., 2007Deyama S. Yamamoto J. Machida T. Tanimoto S. Nakagawa T. Kaneko S. Satoh M. Minami M. Inhibition of glutamatergic transmission by morphine in the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus reduces pain-induced aversion.Neurosci.

Glutamatergic activation of anterior cingulate cortex produces an aversive teaching signal.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 398-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). We first investigated how hunger influences the affective properties of pain by examining whether hunger attenuates a condition placed avoidance normally associated with inflammatory pain (Figure 3A). We found that ad libitum-fed mice exhibited a conditioned place avoidance of cues previously paired with formalin-induced inflammatory pain (Figures 3B–3D). This post-conditioning avoidance was abolished in animals that were food-restricted during conditioning (Figures 3B–3D), a result that was independent of changes in locomotor activity (Figures 3E and 3F). This result is not likely due to a hunger-induced deficit in associative learning, given that food-restricted mice learn to avoid contexts associated with other aversive stimuli as effectively as ad libitum-fed mice (Figure 3G). Similar to the attenuation of a formalin-conditioned place avoidance, we found that hunger also attenuated formalin-induced immobility (Figure 3H). Together, these data suggest that hunger attenuates measures of pain-induced negative affect, in addition to behavioral responses to inflammatory pain. Formalin paw injection leads to paw inflammation in food-deprived mice (Figures S1I and S1J), suggesting central mechanisms may mediate the interaction between hunger and inflammatory pain. Neural circuits activated by hunger are well-characterized (Sternson and Eiselt, 2017Sternson S.M. Eiselt A.K. Three Pillars for the Neural Control of Appetite.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2017; 79: 401-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In particular, neurons that co-express AgRP, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and NPY (referred to as AgRP neurons) are critical regulators of food intake (Luquet et al., 2005Luquet S. Perez F.A. Hnasko T.S. Palmiter R.D. NPY/AgRP neurons are essential for feeding in adult mice but can be ablated in neonates.Science. 2005; 310: 683-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). AgRP neuron inhibition in hungry mice reduces food intake (Krashes et al., 2011Krashes M.J. Koda S. Ye C. Rogan S.C. Adams A.C. Cusher D.S. Maratos-Flier E. Roth B.L. Lowell B.B. Rapid, reversible activation of AgRP neurons drives feeding behavior in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 1424-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar), while activation of AgRP neurons in sated mice robustly increases food intake (Aponte et al., 2011Aponte Y. Atasoy D. Sternson S.M. AGRP neurons are sufficient to orchestrate feeding behavior rapidly and without training.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, Krashes et al., 2011Krashes M.J. Koda S. Ye C. Rogan S.C. Adams A.C. Cusher D.S. Maratos-Flier E. Roth B.L. Lowell B.B. Rapid, reversible activation of AgRP neurons drives feeding behavior in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 1424-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Photostimulation of mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in AgRP neurons (AgRPChR2) dramatically reduced both formalin-induced inflammatory phase pain responses (Figures 4A–4D and S2A–S2C) and CFA-induced nociceptive sensitization (Figures 4E, 4F, and S2F–S2H) relative to responses of GFP-expressing control mice (AgRPGFP). This effect was specific to inflammatory pain as activating AgRP neurons did not influence acute phase chemical or thermal pain responses (Figures S2D, S2E, S2I, and S2J) nor responses to control saline paw injections (Figures S2K–S2M). Initiating AgRP neuron stimulation during an ongoing pain response inhibited paw licking within minutes (Figures 4G and 4H). This indicates that AgRP neuron activity rapidly mediates a behavioral switch and does not rely on long-term activity of AgRP neurons that may entrain a single behavioral state. To test whether AgRP neuron activity is sufficient to suppress inflammatory pain, we chemogenetically inhibited AgRP neurons during hunger. Food-deprived mice expressing inhibitory designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs, hM4D) in AgRP neurons (AgRPhM4D+) significantly reduce food intake relative to littermate controls (AgRPhM4D−) following injection of the designer ligand clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) (Figure 4I), as previously described (Krashes et al., 2011Krashes M.J. Koda S. Ye C. Rogan S.C. Adams A.C. Cusher D.S. Maratos-Flier E. Roth B.L. Lowell B.B. Rapid, reversible activation of AgRP neurons drives feeding behavior in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 1424-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Inhibition of AgRP neurons significantly reduced the protective effect of hunger on inflammatory pain (Figures 4J–4L). Thus, AgRP neuron activity during hunger is both necessary and sufficient to suppress inflammatory pain responses without affecting acute pain responses, recapitulating the behavioral interaction observed in hunger and identifying a neural mechanism for the suppression of inflammatory pain.Figure S2AgRP Neuron Activity Specifically Inhibits Inflammatory Phase Pain Response without Off-Target Licking Effects, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Experimental design: Laser light pulses delivered to AgRP neurons of AgRPGFP and AgRPChR2 mice began 10 min before formalin injection and continued while formalin-induced paw licking was quantified.(B) Inflammatory phase formalin-induced lick bouts in AgRPGFP and AgRPChR2 mice (unpaired t test, p < 0.01).(C) Laser stimulation-induced food intake (y axis) correlates with inflammatory phase paw licking (x axis); AgRPGFP (gray circles, n = 12), AgRPChR2 (blue circles, n = 12), red circles are group averages (Pearson regression, R = 0.60, p < 0.01).(D) Time spent paw licking during acute phase of formalin test in AgRPGFP and AgRPChR2 mice (unpaired t test, p = ns).(E) Acute phase formalin-induced lick bouts in AgRPGFP and AgRPChR2 mice (unpaired t test, p = ns).(F) Experimental design: AgRPGFP and AgRPChR2 mice were injected with Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA) after a baseline Von Frey test.

See also Table S2. Given that hunger suppresses longer-term inflammatory pain responses, we next sought to identify brain regions where hunger and nociceptive information converge. Several brain regions innervated by AgRP neurons are also activated by formalin paw injection and implicated in nociception (Baulmann et al., 2000Baulmann J. Spitznagel H. Herdegen T. Unger T. Culman J. Tachykinin receptor inhibition and c-Fos expression in the rat brain following formalin-induced pain.Neuroscience. 2000; 95: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To explore potential brain regions targeted by AgRP neurons that mediate inflammatory pain, we performed a formalin paw injection in ad libitum-fed mice and quantified neurons directly under AgRP axons that expressed the immediate early gene Fos. The number of neurons expressing Fos protein was increased in the terminal projection fields of several AgRP neuron target regions following formalin paw injection compared to mice who received saline or no injection (Figures 5A, 5B and S3A).Figure S3AgRP → PBN Neurons Selectively Mediate Inflammatory Pain, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Schematics of target brain regions and representative images of formalin-induced Fos underlying AgRP axon projections in the BNST, PVT, PVH, LH, CeA, PAG, and PBN.

https://openalex.org/W2790026741,"Recent advances in culture-free microbiological techniques bring new understanding of the role of intestinal microbiota in heath and performance. Intestinal microbial communities in chickens assume a near-stable state within the week which leaves a very small window for permanent microbiota remodelling. It is the first colonisers that determine the fate of microbial community in humans and birds alike, and after the microbiota has matured there are very small odds for permanent modification as stable community resists change. In this study we inoculated broiler chicks immediately post hatch, with 3 species of Lactobacillus, identified by sequencing of 16S rRNA and pheS genes as L. ingluviei, L. agilis and L. reuteri. The strains were isolated from the gut of healthy chickens as reproducibly persistent Lactobacillus strains among multiple flocks. Birds inoculated with the probiotic mix reached significantly higher weight by 28 days of age. Although each strain was able to colonise when administered alone, administering the probiotic mix at-hatch resulted in colonisation by only L. ingluviei. High initial abundance of L. ingluviei was slowly reducing, however, the effects of at-hatch administration of the Lactobacillus mix on modifying microbiota development and structure remained persistent. There was a tendency of promotion of beneficial and reduction in pathogenic taxa in the probiotic administered group."
https://openalex.org/W2792456569,"We investigated the role of exosomes derived from maternal and umbilical cord blood in the regulation of angiogenesis. We report here that both maternal exosomes (MEs) and umbilical exosomes (UEs) significantly enhance HUVEC proliferation, migration, and tube formation. Importantly, ME-treated HUVECs (MEXs) displayed significantly increased migration, but not proliferation or tube formation, compared with UE-treated HUVECs (UEXs). We found that the expression of a subset of migration-related microRNAs (miRNAs), including miR-210-3p, miR-376c-3p, miR-151a-5p, miR-296-5p, miR-122-5p, and miR-550a-5p, among others, were significantly increased or decreased in UEs, and this altered expression was likely correlated with the differential regulation of HUVEC migration. We also found that the mRNA expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was up-regulated in MEXs and UEXs and, moreover, that inhibiting HGF partially abolished the enhanced cell migration induced by UEs. Our results suggest that both MEs and UEs greatly enhanced endothelial cell (EC) functions and differentially regulated EC migration, which was mostly attributed to the different expression profiles of exosomal miRNA. These findings highlight the importance of exosomes in the regulation of angiogenesis during pregnancy. Exosomal miRNAs, in particular, may be of great significance for the regulation of angiogenesis in maintaining normal pregnancy.-Jia, L., Zhou, X., Huang, X., Xu, X., Jia, Y., Wu, Y., Yao, J., Wu, Y., Wang, K.

https://openalex.org/W2789619620,"Cachexia is a complex tissue-wasting syndrome characterized by inflammation, hypermetabolism, increased energy expenditure, and anorexia. Browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) is one of the significant factors that contribute to energy wasting in cachexia. By utilizing a cell implantation model, we demonstrate here that the lipid mobilizing factor zinc-α2-glycoprotein (ZAG) induces WAT browning in mice. Increased circulating levels of ZAG not only induced lipolysis in adipose tissues but also caused robust browning in WAT. Stimulating WAT progenitors with ZAG recombinant protein or expression of ZAG in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) strongly enhanced brown-like differentiation. At the molecular level, ZAG stimulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and early B cell factor 2 expression and promoted their recruitment to the PR/SET domain 16 (Prdm16) promoter, leading to enhanced expression of Prdm16, which determines brown cell fate. In brown adipose tissue, ZAG stimulated the expression of PPARγ and PPARγ coactivator 1α and promoted recruitment of PPARγ to the uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) promoter, leading to increased expression of Ucp1. Overall, our results reveal a novel function of ZAG in WAT browning and highlight the targeting of ZAG as a potential therapeutic application in humans with cachexia.-Elattar, S., Dimri, M., Satyanarayana, A. The tumor secretory factor ZAG promotes white adipose tissue browning and energy wasting."
https://openalex.org/W2790592629,"Background The need to evaluate the human health safety of fishery resources remain urgent in the mist of the ever-increasing fear of heavy metal toxicity from the consumption of Ghana’s fisheries resource, as a consequence of pollution from several anthropogenic activities including artisanal gold mining. Nevertheless, the bigeye grunt (Brachydeuterus auritus) and Bagrid catfish (Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus) remain commercially valuable fish species in West Africa and continue to attract high patronage. Method Forty-five specimens each of C. nigrodigitatus and B. auritus collected from the Weija Dam and the Tema Fishing Habour in Ghana, between June and September 2016, were analysed for seven heavy metals using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. Result Lead and Cadmium were below detection in all samples while Cu was not detected in B. auritus. Levels of the remaining metals (mg kg-1) were below FAO/WHO maximum permissible limits in fish and occurred in the rank order Se (3.5) > Zn (2.34) > Cu (0.59) > As (0.37) > Hg (0.19) in C. nigrodigitatus and Se (2.97) > Zn (2.28) > Hg (0.31) > As (0.21) in B. auritus. Only As in C. nigrodigitatus recorded Estimated Weekly Intake (EWI) greater than FAO/WHO Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI). Also, As in C. nigrodigitatus and Hg in B. auritus had Targeted Hazard Quotient (THQ) greater than 1 for individuals consuming the fishes on daily basis and therefore, raising concerns. However, for both species of fish, cancer risk of As was 1 in 10,000,000,000 and modified Health Benefits values of Se (HBVSe) were positive indicating the health risks that might accompany Hg exposure would be negated. Since toxicity depends on the concentration and quantity of a pollutant consumed, safe maximum consumption rate of C. nigrodigitatus based on As concentrations was 0.21 mg per day and that of B. auritus was 0.058 mg per day for Hg. With an average of 0.227 kg fish per meal of an adult human, these translated into not more than 24 C. nigrodigitatus and nine (9) B. auritus meals in a month but because fish is consumed at 0.0685 kg per person per day in Ghana, these values respectively translates to 93 and 30 safe days of consumption per month. Conclusion At the rate of 0.0685 kg fish per person per day that fish is consumed in Ghana, the consumption of the two species of fish in Ghana would essentially be of little or no consequence to consumers."
https://openalex.org/W2792059397,"Early diagnosis is critical for individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in clinical practice because its progress is irreversible. In the existing literature, support vector machine (SVM) has always been applied to distinguish between AD and healthy controls (HC) based on neuroimaging data. But previous studies have only used a single SVM to classify AD and HC, and the accuracy is not very high and generally less than 90%. The method of random support vector machine cluster was proposed to classify AD and HC in this paper. From the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, the subjects including 25 AD individuals and 35 HC individuals were obtained. The classification accuracy could reach to 94.44% in the results. Furthermore, the method could also be used for feature selection and the accuracy could be maintained at the level of 94.44%. In addition, we could also find out abnormal brain regions (inferior frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus and cingulate cortex). It is worth noting that the proposed random support vector machine cluster could be a new insight to help the diagnosis of AD."

In this paper, we examine quantitatively the extent of this disproportionate access to diagnoses and treatment of diabetes, hypertension and malaria in Ghana. A total of 220 health facilities was surveyed across the country in 2011. Findings indicate that diagnoses and treatment of infectious diseases were more accessible than NCDs. In terms of treatment, 78% and 87% of health facilities had two of the recommended malaria drugs while less than 35% had essential diabetes and hypertension drugs. There is a significant unmet need for diagnoses and treatment of NCDs in Ghana. These inequities have implications for high morbidity and mortality from NCDs. We recommend the use of task shifting as a model to increase the delivery of NCD services."
https://openalex.org/W2790100370,"India has been perceived as a development enigma: Recent rates of economic growth have not been matched by similar rates in health and nutritional improvements. To meet the second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG2) of achieving zero hunger by 2030, India faces a substantial challenge in meeting basic nutritional needs in addition to addressing population, environmental and dietary pressures. Here we have mapped—for the first time—the Indian food system from crop production to household-level availability across three key macronutrients categories of ‘calories’, ‘digestible protein’ and ‘fat’. To better understand the potential of reduced food chain losses and improved crop yields to close future food deficits, scenario analysis was conducted to 2030 and 2050. Under India’s current self-sufficiency model, our analysis indicates severe shortfalls in availability of all macronutrients across a large proportion (>60%) of the Indian population. The extent of projected shortfalls continues to grow such that, even in ambitious waste reduction and yield scenarios, enhanced domestic production alone will be inadequate in closing the nutrition supply gap. We suggest that to meet SDG2 India will need to take a combined approach of optimising domestic production and increasing its participation in global trade."
https://openalex.org/W2793305177,"Tendons are essential weight-bearing structures that are often affected by tendinopathy, which leads to pain and impaired mobility. In healthy Achilles tendons, no significant renewal of the weight-bearing collagen matrix seems to occur during adult life, but tendinopathy may lead to increased turnover. The carbon-14 ([14C]) bomb pulse method was used to measure lifelong replacement rates of collagen in tendinopathic and healthy Achilles tendons (tendinopathic: n = 25, born 1937–1972. Healthy: n = 10, born 1929–1966). As expected, the healthy tendon collagen had not been replaced during adulthood, but in tendinopathic tendon, a substantial renewal had occurred. Modeling of the [14C] data suggested that one half of the collagen in tendinopathic matrix had undergone continuous slow turnover for years before the presentation of symptoms. This finding allows for a new concept in tendon pathogenesis because it suggests that either the symptoms of tendinopathy represent a late phase of a very prolonged disease process, or an abnormally high collagen exchange could be a risk factor for tendon disorders rather than being a result of disease.—Heinemeier, K.M., Schjerling, P., Øhlenschlæger, T.

https://openalex.org/W2791002863,"The aim of this study was to explore the development of the gut microbiota in 168 German Shepherd dogs (30 litters) from 7 weeks to 18 months of age and furthermore, to study the effect of relatedness, maternal microbiota composition and living environment in a large and well-defined population of dogs. Using 454 pyrosequencing, we assessed the effects of pre- and postnatal probiotic supplementation (Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC533 (La1)) and analysed whether administration of the probiotic strain influenced fecal microbiota composition in a placebo controlled double-blinded study. The bitches were treated with probiotics or placebo during last trimester of pregnancy and until their puppies were 8 weeks old, the puppies received the same treatment as their mothers between 3–12 weeks of age. Samples from bitches were collected at pregnancy day 42, partum, 4 weeks postpartum and 7 weeks postpartum and from puppies at the age 4 weeks, 7 weeks, 12–13 months and 15–18 months. Serum IgA, total serum IgE, fecal IgA and IgG antibody responses against canine distemper virus were analysed by ELISA in order to detect any immune stimulating effects of the probiotic strain. Analysis of the fecal microbiota composition showed that the predominant phyla were the same in 7 weeks old puppies as in pregnant and lactating bitches (Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes). Proportions among different bacteria as well as diversity varied from 7 weeks old puppies up to 15–18 months of age. Litter mates had a more similar fecal microbiota compared to unrelated dogs and 7 weeks old puppies were more similar to their mothers than to unrelated bitches at 7 weeks postpartum but not at partum. We observed a change in the relative abundance of different bacteria during lactation, and an increase in diversity from pregnancy to end of lactation. The microbial diversity was affected by living area where dogs living in big cities had higher diversity compared to dogs living at the countryside. However, we were not able to demonstrate an effect by pre and postnatal exposure to Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC533 (La1) upon the diversity or composition of the microbiota or the levels of serum IgA, total serum IgE, fecal IgA or vaccine response. Our findings provide a better understanding of the canine fecal microbiota in growing dogs as well as in pregnant and lactating bitches. This information forms a basis for further research on the connection between early gut colonization and immune function later in life."
https://openalex.org/W2793994394,"Adult intervertebral discs (IVDs) have poor endogenous healing capacity, because of their challenging microenvironment and complex mechanical demands, which can result in painful IVD herniation. There are no regenerative strategies available to improve IVD healing and restore its function. Neonatal mice are excellent models of mammalian regeneration, but there are no studies of the regenerative capacity of neonatal IVDs. In this study, we developed a neonatal model of improved IVD healing to inform repair strategies after herniation. In vivo puncture injuries were performed to simulate herniation with complete annulus fibrosus (AF) tears in caudal IVDs of neonatal (postnatal d 5) and adult (4-6 mo) Scleraxis green fluorescent protein ( ScxGFP) mice. Acute and long-term healing responses were assessed with histologic, radiologic, and biomechanical measurements. Neonates underwent accelerated IVD healing compared to adults with functional restoration and enhanced structural repair after herniation. A population of ScxGFP- cells identified in the neonatal repair site may be associated with this improved healing and warrants future investigation. In summary, function of neonatal IVDs was restored after herniation injury, whereas that of adult discs was not. This improved healing response is likely driven by multiple mechanisms that may include differences in mechanical loading and available repair cells during growth.-Torre, O.

Information on patients' self-reported smoking history was retrieved by means of a postal questionnaire. Tumors were stratified regarding the risk of progression defined by tumor stage and grade. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze the relation between smoking intensity and aggressiveness of the tumor.The UBC study population comprised 323 (17.4%) never smokers, 870 (46.8%) former cigarette smokers, and 630 (33.9%) current cigarette smokers. A higher smoking amount was a risk factor of getting high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) compared with low-risk NMIBC in ever and former cigarette smokers (OR: 1.02 per cigarette smoked, 95% CI: 1.00-1.03 and OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.05, respectively). A statistically significant dose-response increase in the risk of a more aggressive cancer type (high-risk NMIBC and MIBC) was observed with increasing smoking duration among former smokers (p for trend 0.035 and 0.008, respectively). No significant association of the evaluated smoking intensity variables was observed in current smokers. A longer time of smoking cessation correlated with a lower odds of a more aggressive cancer.We observed a weak increase in the risk of a more aggressive tumor type with increasing smoking intensity in former smokers, but this association was absent in current smokers. This conflicting result may suggest that there is no strong relation between smoking intensity and bladder cancer aggressiveness. Analyses of prospective studies with longitudinal smoking assessment may provide a more definitive answer to the research question."
https://openalex.org/W2793539342,"News consumers expect news outlets to be objective and balanced in their reports of events and opinions. However, there is a growing body of evidence of bias in the media caused by underlying political and socio-economic viewpoints. Previous studies have tried to classify the partiality of the media, but there is little work on quantifying it, and less still on the nature of this partiality. The vast amount of content published in social media enables us to quantify the inclination of the press to pre-defined sides of the socio-political spectrum. To describe such tendencies, we use tweets to automatically compute a news outlet’s political and socio-economic orientation. Results show that the media have a measurable bias, and illustrate this by showing the favoritism of Chilean media for the ruling political parties in the country. This favoritism becomes clearer as we empirically observe a shift in the position of the mass media when there is a change in government. Even though relative differences in bias between news outlets can be observed, public awareness of the bias of the media landscape as a whole appears to be limited by the political space defined by the news that we receive as a population. We found that the nature of the bias is reflected in the vocabulary used and the entities mentioned by different news outlets. A survey conducted among news consumers confirms that media bias has an impact on the coverage of controversial topics and that this is perceivable by the general audience. Having a more accurate method to measure and characterize media bias will help readers position outlets in the socio-economic landscape, even when a (sometimes opposite) self-declared position is stated. This will empower readers to better reflect on the content provided by their news outlets of choice."
https://openalex.org/W2789965127,"Climate change is expected to affect resource-consumer interactions underlying stability in polar food webs. Polar benthic organisms have adapted to the marked seasonality characterising their habitats by concentrating foraging and reproductive activity in summer months, when inputs from sympagic and pelagic producers increase. While this enables the persistence of biodiverse food webs, the mechanisms underlying changes in resource use and nutrient transfer are poorly understood. Thus, our understanding of how temporal and spatial variations in the supply of resources may affect food web structure and functioning is limited. By means of C and N isotopic analyses of two key Antarctic benthic consumers (Adamussium colbecki, Bivalvia, and Sterechinus neumayeri, Echinoidea) and Bayesian mixing models, we describe changes in trophic niche and nutrient transfer across trophic levels associated with the long- and short-term diet and body size of specimens sampled in midsummer in both shallow and deep waters. Samplings occurred soon after the sea-ice broke up at Tethys Bay, an area characterised by extreme seasonality in sea-ice coverage and productivity in the Ross Sea. In the long term, the trophic niche was broader and variation between specimens was greater, with intermediate-size specimens generally consuming a higher number of resources than small and large specimens. The coupling of energy channels in the food web was consequently more direct than in the short term. Sediment and benthic algae were more frequently consumed in the long term, before the sea-ice broke up, while consumers specialised on sympagic algae and plankton in the short term. Regardless of the time scale, sympagic algae were more frequently consumed in shallow waters, while plankton was more frequently consumed in deep waters. Our results suggest a strong temporal relationship between resource availability and the trophic niche of benthic consumers in Antarctica. Potential climate-driven changes in the timing and quality of nutrient inputs may have profound implications for the structure of polar food webs and the persistence of their constituent species, which have adapted their trophic niches to a highly predictable schedule of resource inputs."
https://openalex.org/W2791677472,"Acetylcholine (ACh)-synthesizing neurons are major components of the enteric nervous system (ENS). They release ACh and peptidergic neurotransmitters onto enteric neurons and muscle. However, pharmacological interrogation has proven inadequate to demonstrate an essential role for ACh. Our objective was to determine whether elimination of ACh synthesis during embryogenesis alters prenatal viability, intestinal function, the neurotransmitter complement, and the microbiome. Conditional deletion of choline acetyltransferase ( ChAT), the ACh synthetic enzyme, in neural crest-derived neurons ( ChAT-Null) was performed. Survival, ChAT activity, gut motility, and the microbiome were studied. ChAT was conditionally deleted in ENS neural crest-derived cells. Despite ChAT absence, mice were born live and survived the first 2 wk. They failed to gain significant weight in the third postnatal week, dying between postnatal d 18 and 30. Small intestinal transit of carmine red was 50% slower in ChAT-Nulls vs. WT and ChAT- Het. The colons of many neonatal ChAT-Null mice contained compacted feces, suggesting dysmotility. Microbiome analysis revealed dysbiosis in ChAT-Null mice. Developmental deletion of ChAT activity in enteric neurons results in proximal gastrointestinal tract dysmotility, critically diminished colonic transit, failure to thrive, intestinal dysbiosis, and death.

For each case up to 6 controls, matched for birth year and gestational age, were selected. The resulting study population consisted of 720 cases and 3,567 controls. Information on socioeconomic data about the mother, maternal morbidity, pregnancy related diagnoses, perinatal diagnoses of the infant, and procedures in the perinatal period, was obtained for all cases and controls and analyzed with univariable and multivariable logistic regressions for the whole study population as well as for subgroups according to gestational age.In the study population as a whole, we found independent positive associations with necrotizing enterocolitis for isoimmunization, fetal distress, cesarean section, neonatal bacterial infection including sepsis, erythrocyte transfusion, persistent ductus arteriosus, cardiac malformation, gastrointestinal malformation, and chromosomal abnormality. Negative associations were found for maternal weight, preeclampsia, maternal urinary infection, premature rupture of the membranes, and birthweight. Different patterns of associations were seen in the subgroups of different gestational age.With some interesting exceptions, especially in negative associations, the results of this large, population based study, are in keeping with earlier studies.

https://openalex.org/W2790456922,"The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the principal vector of arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus. These arboviruses are transmitted during adult female mosquito bloodfeeding. While these viruses must transverse the midgut to replicate, the blood meal must also reach the midgut to be digested, absorbed, or excreted, as aggregation of blood meal metabolites can be toxic to the female mosquito midgut. The midgut peritrophic matrix (PM), a semipermeable extracellular layer comprised of chitin fibrils, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans, is one such mechanism of protection for the mosquito midgut. However, this structure has not been characterized for adult female Ae. aegypti. We conducted a mass spectrometry based proteomic analysis to identify proteins that comprise or are associated with the adult female Ae. aegypti early midgut PM. Altogether, 474 unique proteins were identified, with 115 predicted as secreted. GO-term enrichment analysis revealed an abundance of serine-type proteases and several known and novel intestinal mucins. In addition, approximately 10% of the peptides identified corresponded to known salivary proteins, indicating Ae. aegypti mosquitoes extensively swallow their own salivary secretions. However, the physiological relevance of this remains unclear, and further studies are needed to determine PM proteins integral for midgut protection from blood meal derived toxicity and pathogen protection. Finally, we describe substantial discordance between previously described transcriptionally changes observed in the midgut in response to a bloodmeal and the presence of the corresponding protein in the PM.

Methods In this cross-sectional study, 41 glaucoma patients and 12 age- and sex-matched controls underwent standard automated perimetry (SAP) and frequency doubling technology (FDT) as functional evaluation; optic disc stereophotograph, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) and confocal scanning laser tomography as ocular structural evaluation; and 3T MRI. Structure-structure and structure-function correlation were performed using bootstrap resampling method for clustered data. Results The ION mean diameter and cross-sectional area were different between glaucoma and control groups at 5mm and 10mm (all, p≤0.011) from the globe, but not at 15mm (both, p≥0.067). LGN height was significantly lower in glaucoma group (p = 0.005). OCT rim area and functional parameters (SAP and FDT) correlated significantly with all ION segments, showing stronger correlations at 10 and 15 mm. ION parameters at 10 and 15 mm presented mild-to-moderate correlation with OCT peripapillary nerve fiber layer thickness, and ION at 15mm had mild association with the neuroretinal rim area on stereophotographs. Although LGN height was significantly smaller in glaucoma group (p = 0.005), LGN parameters were not associated with any ocular structural or functional parameter. Conclusion Assessment of central and peripheral nervous systems using 3T MRI confirmed that glaucoma patients had smaller ION dimensions and LGN height compared to the control group. In general, ION dimensions presented mild to moderate correlations with functional and ocular structural parameters. Although ION had significant correlations at any distance from the eye, the ION distal locations correlated better with OCT results and functional parameters. However, LGN parameters were not associated with functional or ocular structural parameters."

Recent studies have uncovered an oncogenic role of mutations in the CSF3R gene in many hematologic malignancies. To find additional CSF3R mutations that give rise to cell transformation, we performed a cellular transformation assay in which murine interleukin 3 (IL-3)–dependent Ba/F3 cells were transduced with WT CSF3R plasmid and screened for spontaneous growth in the absence of IL-3. Any outgrowth clones were sequenced to identify CSF3R mutations with transformation capacity. We identified several novel mutations and determined that they transform cells via four distinct mechanisms: 1) cysteine- and disulfide bond–mediated dimerization (S581C); 2) polar, noncharged amino acid substitution at the transmembrane helix dimer interface at residue Thr-640; 3) increased internalization by a Glu-524 substitution that mimics a low G-CSF dose; and 4) hydrophobic amino acid substitutions in the membrane-proximal residues Thr-612, Thr-615, and Thr-618. Furthermore, the change in signaling activation was related to an altered CSF3R localization. We also found that CSF3R-induced STAT3 and ERK activations require CSF3R internalization, whereas STAT5 activation occurred at the cell surface. Cumulatively, we have expanded the regions of the CSF3R extracellular and transmembrane domains in which missense mutations exhibit leukemogenic capacity and have further elucidated the mechanistic underpinnings that underlie altered CSF3R expression, dimerization, and signaling activation.

Cumulatively, we have expanded the regions of the CSF3R extracellular and transmembrane domains in which missense mutations exhibit leukemogenic capacity and have further elucidated the mechanistic underpinnings that underlie altered CSF3R expression, dimerization, and signaling activation.

Wildtype (WT) CSF3R consists of three structural domains: extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic, which regulate ligand binding, dimerization, and downstream signaling activation/termination of the receptor, respectively (2Tamada T.

Recent studies have uncovered an oncogenic role of CSF3R mutations across all CSF3R domains in various hematologic malignancies. Briefly, CSF3R cytoplasmic truncation mutations, including CSF3R isoform IV, were shown to disrupt receptor internalization and/or degradation, leading to overexpression of the receptor on the cell surface, inducing sustained STAT5 and reduced STAT3 activation in a G-CSF–dependent manner (12Hunter M.G.

More recently, we have identified a gain-of-function CSF3R extracellular domain mutation, W341C, in an acute myeloid leukemia patient (21Zhang H. Means S. Schultz A.R. Watanabe-Smith K. Medeiros B.C.

W341C was further shown to transform cells via cysteine- and disulfide bond–mediated dimer formation. In the past, we have observed that Ba/F3 cells harboring CSF3R WT can sometimes spontaneously transform at later time points in a Ba/F3 IL-3 withdrawal assay due to the acquisition of bona fide oncogenic mutations in CSF3R, such as the T618I mutation (22Watanabe-Smith K. Godil J. Agarwal A. Tognon C. Druker B.

We therefore took advantage of this Ba/F3 spontaneous transformation model and performed sequencing of the outgrown clones to identify novel CSF3R activating mutations that would further inform us about the biology of this receptor. The CSF3R T618I mutation was previously found to induce constitutive receptor activation and transform Ba/F3 cells with fast kinetics (around 3–4 days) (17Maxson J.E. Gotlib J. Pollyea D.A.

We sequenced these transformed CSF3R WT Ba/F3 cells with primers covering most of the transgene. All of the autonomous CSF3R WT Ba/F3 clones showed an acquired single point mutation not present at detectable levels at the start of the experiment but likely selected during the growth factor withdrawal. Through this approach, we identified nine missense mutations (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1). These included two well-characterized activating mutations (T618I and T640N) (17Maxson J.E. Gotlib J. Pollyea D.A.

Among the nine mutations identified, two (T640N and G644E) are located in the transmembrane domain. Interestingly, T612A, T612I, and P621A are located in the same membrane-proximal region as the T618I mutation, whereas E524K, E524G, and S581C are located in the fourth and fifth fibronectin-like type III domains. To confirm that these mutations induce cytokine-independent cell growth, we generated viral constructs expressing these mutations and performed an IL-3 withdrawal assay. E524K, E524G, S581C, T612A, T612I, and T640N transformed cells with fast kinetics. In contrast, P621A and G644E transformed cells with long latency, and further sequencing showed acquisition of E524K and T640N mutations in these transformed clones, respectively (Fig. 1B). We, therefore, focused on the molecular mechanisms of the mutations that conferred robust ligand-independent growth and did not acquire additional mutations. Having identified novel activating mutations in CSF3R, we next investigated the mechanisms by which these mutations lead to cellular transformation. Previously, we have shown that mutations generating an additional cysteine in the extracellular domain of CSF3R form intramolecular disulfide bonds, leading to constitutive receptor dimerization (21Zhang H. Means S. Schultz A.R. Watanabe-Smith K. Medeiros B.C. Bottomly D. Wilmot B. McWeeney S.K. Kükenshöner T. Hantschel O. Tyner J.W. Unpaired extracellular cysteine mutations of CSF3R mediate gain or loss of function.Cancer Res. 2017; 77 (28652245): 4258-426710.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that the same mechanism was eliciting transforming capacity of CSF3R S581C, we first validated that S581C, but not S581R, could transform cells (Fig. 2A). Moreover, we observed markedly increased dimers of the mutant protein compared with WT under nonreducing conditions, which were abrogated on a reducing gel (Fig. 2B). In contrast, other mutations, T618I, T612A, and E524K, demonstrated only subtle dimerization under nonreducing conditions, which was similar to levels of WT dimerization in the presence or absence of G-CSF stimulation (Fig. S2A). Consistent with these findings, we also observed enhanced growth inhibition of S581C-transformed cells versus E524K-transformed cells after exposure to a reducing agent, β-ME (Fig. 2C). Using coimmunoprecipitation, previous studies have demonstrated increased dimer formation of T618I and T640N relative to WT receptor (18Maxson J.E. Luty S.B. MacManiman J.D. Paik J.C. Gotlib J.

These data suggest that T618I and G-CSF–stimulated CSF3R WT may form dynamic nonstable dimers, which are different from stable dimers formed by cysteine-mediated disulfide bonding. T640N was proposed to promote dimer stabilization by forming polar hydrogen bonds between the transmembrane α helices in a pair of dimerized receptors (24Plo I. Zhang Y. Le Couédic J.-P. Nakatake M.

Similar mechanisms have been characterized in other receptors (thrombopoietin receptor MPL W505N (25Ding J. Komatsu H. Iida S. Yano H. Kusumoto S. Inagaki A. Mori F. Ri M. Ito A. Wakita A. Ishida T.

To confirm this hypothesis, we created a nonpolar substitution, isoleucine, at this position. T640I did not transform Ba/F3 cells (Fig. 2D), consistent with the prediction that isoleucine would not engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions with the opposing transmembrane helix. Plo et al. (24Plo I. Zhang Y. Le Couédic J.-P. Nakatake M. Boulet J.-M. Itaya M. Smith S.O. Debili N. Constantinescu S.N. Vainchenker W. Louache F. de Botton S.

Based on their structural model, the G644E substitution that we identified in our Ba/F3 outgrowth experiments would not be predicted to be at the helix interface. In accordance, the G644E mutation did not confer transformation capacity. However, it is important to note that this glutamic acid substitution creates a negative charge, which could cause electrostatic repulsion between dimer pairs. To test whether a charged substitution at Thr-640 or hydrophilic amino acid substitution at other amino acid positions located in the dimer interface could activate the receptor, we generated additional artificial mutations at Thr-640, Phe-633, and Trp-647, which were predicted to be located at the dimer interface by the modeling study of Plo et al. (24Plo I. Zhang Y. Le Couédic J.-P. Nakatake M. Boulet J.-M. Itaya M. Smith S.O. Debili N. Constantinescu S.N. Vainchenker W. Louache F. de Botton S. An activating mutation in the CSF3R gene induces a hereditary chronic neutrophilia.J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206 (19620628): 1701-170710.1084/jem.20090693Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We observed that T640Q transformed Ba/F3 cells and induced ERK and STAT3 activation, whereas F633E/Q, T640D/E, and W647Q did not transform Ba/F3 cells or demonstrated robust ERK and STAT3 activation (Fig. 2E and Fig. S3). These data indicate that only polar, noncharged amino acid substitution at the most energetically favorable amino acid position, Thr-640, can confer cell transformation potential (Fig. S2B). To understand the mechanism by which the E524K and E524G mutations transform cells, we first performed bone marrow (BM) cfu and signaling activation assays. Interestingly, we observed that E524K induced ligand-independent cell growth and increased STAT3 activation but did not increase STAT5 or ERK activation (Fig. 3, A–C, and Fig. S4A). In addition, E524K demonstrated reduced receptor surface expression and increased receptor internalization, although receptor degradation was not affected (Fig. 3, D and E, and Fig. S4B). To further elucidate the association of the altered receptor internalization and the cell transformation capacity, we mutated the dileucine (Leu-776/777) and serine (Ser-772) in the internalization domain that are known to be important for receptor internalization (13Aarts L.H. Roovers O. Ward A.C. Touw I.P. Receptor activation and 2 distinct COOH-terminal motifs control G-CSF receptor distribution and internalization kinetics.Blood. 2004; 103 (14512302): 571-57910.1182/blood-2003-07-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We observed that these internalization domain mutations (L776A/L777A or S772A) completely abrogated the surface expression and transformation capacity of E524K but did not influence the transformation potential of T618I, T612A, or S581C (Fig. 3, D and F). These data indicate that the internalization domain is important for the transforming potential of E524K. We further performed mutagenic analyses and found that E524K, E524A, E524G, and E524N, but not E524D, transformed Ba/F3 cells and induced G-CSF–independent cell growth (Fig. 3, G and H), indicating that amino acids with negative charge may be important for the normal function of CSF3R surface transportation at amino acid 524. However, further structural analyses are needed to validate this hypothesis. The receptor activation by membrane-proximal mutations, T618I and T615A, was previously characterized to be related to altered receptor glycosylation patterns, leading to increased dimerization of the receptor (19Maxson J.E.

We identified T612A, T612I, T615A, and T618I mutations but not other amino acid substitutions at these residues in leukemia patients or spontaneously transformed Ba/F3 clones. To further understand the different amino acid preference of CSF3R membrane-proximal mutations that can confer transformation potential, we generated all amino acid substitutions of the Thr-618 residue. We observed that aliphatic and aromatic hydrophobic amino acid substitution including T618F, T618L, T618V, T618W, and T618Y cause similar increases of STAT3 and ERK phosphorylation and similar robust cell-transforming capacity as T618I (Fig. 4, A–C). In contrast, we observed that T615A and T612A/I/L transformed Ba/F3 with fast kinetics and induced ligand-independent pSTAT3/pERK activation, but T612F and T615F/I/L did not (Fig. S4, A–C). Based on the amino acid features, we propose that increasing the hydrophobicity (especially to aliphatic and aromatic amino acids at Thr-618I and to aliphatic hydrophobic amino acids at Thr-612 and Thr-615) is required for cell-transforming capacity of CSF3R transforming membrane-proximal mutations. Further structural analysis will be helpful to understand the mechanisms associated with the amino acid preference. Because STAT3 alone is able to transform cells, we performed mutagenesis and an inhibitor assay to investigate the significance of ERK activation. We observed that, similar to the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, the MEK inhibitor trametinib alone was able to inhibit the colony-forming ability of T618I, but not a control drug, imatinib (Fig. S6A). In addition, we mutated Tyr-727 and Tyr-767, which were characterized to be docking sites for STAT3 (11Chakraborty A. Dyer K.F. Cascio M. Mietzner T.A. Tweardy D.J. Identification of a novel Stat3 recruitment and activation motif within the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor.Blood. 1999; 93 (9864141): 15-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that T618I/Y727F/Y767F demonstrated reduced STAT3 activation, whereas the cytokine-independent growth was unchanged (Fig. S5, B–D), indicating that the ERK activation and the remaining STAT3 activation are sufficient for the oncogenesis of T618I. These data suggested that ERK activation is important for the oncogenesis of T618I and that adding ERK pathway inhibition might be a treatment option for patients with T618I mutation. We performed fluorescence immunostaining to better understand the mechanisms of differential signaling pathway activation elicited by different CSF3R mutations. In accordance with the FACS data (Fig. 3D), reduced or absent surface expression was observed with CSF3R E524"
https://openalex.org/W2791070202,"Powdery mildew is a widespread fungal plant disease that can cause significant losses in many crops. Some MLO genes (Mildew resistance locus O) have proved to confer a durable resistance to powdery mildew in several species. Resistance granted by the MLO gene family members has prompted an increasing interest in characterizing these genes and implementing their use in plant breeding. Lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) is a widely grown food legume almost exclusively consumed as dry seed with an average world production of 4.5 million tons. Powdery mildew causes severe losses on certain lentil cultivars under particular environmental conditions. Data mining of the lentil CDC Redberry draft genome allowed to identify up to 15 gene sequences with homology to known MLO genes, designated as LcMLOs. Further characterization of these gene sequences and their deduced protein sequences demonstrated conformity with key MLO protein characteristics such as the presence of transmembrane and calmodulin binding domains, as well as that of other conserved motifs. Phylogenetic and other comparative analyses revealed that LcMLO1 and LcMLO3 are the most likely gene orthologs related to powdery mildew response in other species, sharing a high similarity with other known resistance genes of dicot species, such as pea PsMLO1 and Medicago truncatula MtMLO1 and MtMLO3. Sets of primers were designed as tools to PCR amplify the genomic sequences of LcMLO1 and LcMLO3, also to screen lentil germplasm in search of resistance mutants. Primers were used to obtain the complete sequences of these two genes in all of the six wild lentil relatives. Respective to each gene, all Lens sequences shared a high similarity. Likewise, we used these primers to screen a working collection of 58 cultivated and 23 wild lentil accessions in search of length polymorphisms present in these two genes. All these data widen the insights on this gene family and can be useful for breeding programs in lentil and close related species."
https://openalex.org/W2789606545,"To understand translational capacity on a genome-wide scale across three developmental stages of immature soybean seed cotyledons, ribosome profiling was performed in combination with RNA sequencing and cluster analysis. Transcripts representing 216 unique genes demonstrated a higher level of translational activity in at least one stage by exhibiting higher translational efficiencies (TEs) in which there were relatively more ribosome footprint sequence reads mapping to the transcript than were present in the control total RNA sample. The majority of these transcripts were more translationally active at the early stage of seed development and included 12 unique serine or cysteine proteases and 16 2S albumin and low molecular weight cysteine-rich proteins that may serve as substrates for turnover and mobilization early in seed development. It would appear that the serine proteases and 2S albumins play a vital role in the early stages. In contrast, our investigation of profiles of 19 genes encoding high abundance seed storage proteins, such as glycinins, beta-conglycinins, lectin, and Kunitz trypsin inhibitors, showed that they all had similar patterns in which the TE values started at low levels and increased approximately 2 to 6-fold during development. The highest levels of these seed protein transcripts were found at the mid-developmental stage, whereas the highest ribosome footprint levels of only up to 1.6 TE were found at the late developmental stage. These experimental findings suggest that the major seed storage protein coding genes are primarily regulated at the transcriptional level during normal soybean cotyledon development. Finally, our analyses also identified a total of 370 unique gene models that showed very low TE values including over 48 genes encoding ribosomal family proteins and 95 gene models that are related to energy and photosynthetic functions, many of which have homology to the chloroplast genome. Additionally, we showed that genes of the chloroplast were relatively translationally inactive during seed development."
https://openalex.org/W2793023177,"Chloromonas nivalis (Volvocales, Chlorophyceae) is considered a cosmopolitan species of a snow-inhabiting microalga because cysts morphologically identifiable as zygotes of the species are distributed worldwide. However, recent molecular data demonstrated that field-collected cysts identified as the zygotes consist of multiple species. Recently, we demonstrated that species identification of snow-inhabiting Chloromonas species is possible based on light and electron microscopy of asexual life cycles in strains and molecular phylogenetic analyses. Vegetative cells without eyespots and of inverted-teardrop shape have been reported once in North American material of C. nivalis; however, strains with such vegetative cells in snow-inhabiting species of Chloromonas have not been examined taxonomically in detail. Here, we used light and transmission electron microscopy together with molecular analyses of multiple DNA sequences to examine several C. nivalis strains. The morphological data demonstrated that one North American strain could be identified as C. nivalis, whereas three other strains should be re-classified as C. hoshawii sp. nov. and C. remiasii sp. nov. based on vegetative cell morphology, the number of zoospores within the parental cell wall during asexual reproduction, and whether cell aggregates (resulting from repeated divisions of daughter cells retained within a parental cell wall) were observed in the culture. This taxonomic treatment was supported by multigene phylogeny and comparative molecular analyses that included a rapidly evolving DNA region. Our molecular phylogenetic analyses also demonstrated that the North American strain of C. nivalis was phylogenetically separated from the Austrian and Japanese specimens previously identified as C. nivalis based on zygote morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2790828310,"Bone integrity depends on a finely tuned balance between bone synthesis by osteoblasts and resorption by osteoclasts. The secretion capacity of mature osteoblasts requires strict control of proteostasis. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) prevents the accumulation of unfolded ER proteins via dislocation to the cytosol and degradation by the proteasome. The ER membrane protein, homocysteine-inducible endoplasmic reticulum protein with ubiquitin-like domain 1 (HERPUD1), is a key component of the ERAD multiprotein complex which helps to stabilize the complex and facilitate the efficient degradation of unfolded proteins. HERPUD1 expression is strongly up-regulated by the unfolded protein response and cellular stress. The aim of the current study was to establish whether HERPUD1 and ERAD play roles in osteoblast differentiation and maturation. We evaluated preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cell and primary rat osteoblast differentiation by measuring calcium deposit levels, alkaline phosphatase activity, and runt-related transcription factor 2 and osterix expression. We found that ERAD and proteasomal degradation were activated and that HERPUD1 expression was increased as osteoblast differentiation progressed. The absence of HERPUD1 blocked osteoblast mineralization in vitro and significantly reduced alkaline phosphatase activity. In contrast, HERPUD1 overexpression activated the osteoblast differentiation program. Our results demonstrate that HERPUD1 and ERAD are important for the activation of the osteoblast maturation program and may be useful new targets for elucidating bone physiology.—Américo-Da-Silva, L., Diaz, J., Bustamante, M., Mancilla, G., Oyarzún, I., Verdejo, H.

https://openalex.org/W2790293661,"Delirium is a common complication of vascular surgery. The protective effect of preoperative statins on delirium after vascular surgery is controversial. The authors hypothesized that preoperative statin administration would decrease the incidence of delirium after vascular surgery. From May 2010 to May 2015, 1,132 patients underwent vascular surgery. Postoperative delirium was diagnosed from patients' medical records. The incidence of delirium was 11.5%. The preoperative statin exposure was not associated with reduced delirium in the univariate analysis. After adjusting for covariates, preoperative statin exposure was associated with reduced delirium (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.33-0.87; p = 0.011). This favor effect of statin for delirium was observed after propensity matching (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.34-1.02; p = 0.060). However, the median hospital lengths of stay and in-hospital mortality were not statistically different between the two groups. CRP(C-reactive protein) levels in the unmatched population were lower in the preoperative statin group compared with the other group (p<0.001), however, there was only numerically different without statistical difference after matching (p = 0.083). Preoperative statin use was associated with a decreased incidence of postoperative delirium in patients who underwent vascular surgery. However, preoperative statin did not reduce mortality rate and hospital stay."
https://openalex.org/W2793190914,"Background Methotrexate (MTX) is widely used as disease modifying treatment for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Rheumatological and dermatological guidelines to prevent MTX-induced adverse events diverge in the number and frequency of blood tests. These differences are not based on evidence indicating a higher risk for patients with psoriasis compared to PsA or rheumatic arthritis (RA). This raises the question if multiple testing increases safety, or results in false positive signals potentially leading to early withdrawal of an effective treatment. Objective Compare the effects of MTX monitoring strategies by rheumatologists and dermatologists regarding drug survival, reasons for withdrawal and safety. Methods Retrospective follow-up of all patients diagnosed with psoriasis by dermatologists or PsA by rheumatologists. Included were consecutive patients who started methotrexate (MTX) between 2006 and 2012 and had a scheduled follow-up by dermatologist or rheumatologist. Exclusions were: drug not started after the first prescription or incomplete availability of lab data. Data were extracted from electronic records: start and stop dates and dosing of MTX; treatment with folic acid and dose; reasons for withdrawal of MTX; numbers of blood sampling and types of laboratory tests performed for MTX safety; number of abnormal tests; occurrence of any serious adverse event (SAE). Results 190 Psoriasis and 196 PsA patients starting methotrexate (MTX) were included. Age and sex were comparable. PsA patients used higher initial and maximum doses of MTX and folic acid, but psoriasis patients had a higher frequency of abnormal laboratory results (0.14 vs 0.03 per treatment month, p<0.001), resulting in a striking difference in withdrawal of MTX for abnormal liver enzymes (15.8% vs 3.6%, p<0.001). In PsA patients MTX was withdrawn less frequently for ineffectiveness (15.8 vs 24.2%, p<0.05) leading to longer drug survival in the first course of treatment (37.4±30 vs 18.8±19.1 months). Repeated courses of MTX were more often prescribed by rheumatologists than by dermatologists. There were no significant differences in the occurrence of SAE (psoriasis 0.0041 vs PsA 0.0038 per treatment month) or death (1.6% vs 2.0%) between these groups. Hospital admissions related to infection were recorded in 6 (3.1%) PsA vs 4 (2.1%) psoriasis patients. Conclusion Strict monitoring by dermatologists resulted in more abnormal findings, which reduced drug survival of MTX. The limited monitoring strategy by rheumatologists was not associated with more SAEs. Further research in other populations is needed to confirm whether reduced intensity of monitoring can optimize the use of MTX with sufficient long-term safety."

Hospitals that provide veterinary care for avian patients may serve as a site of exposure of other birds and human staff in the facility to these viruses. They can also provide a useful location to collect samples from avian patients in order to examine the viruses present in wild birds. This study aimed to investigate viruses of biosecurity and/or zoonotic significance in Australian birds by screening samples collected from 409 birds presented to the Australian Wildlife Health Centre at Zoos Victoria's Healesville Sanctuary for veterinary care between December 2014 and December 2015. Samples were tested for avian influenza viruses, herpesviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses, using genus- or family-wide polymerase chain reaction methods coupled with sequencing and phylogenetic analyses for detection and identification of both known and novel viruses. A very low prevalence of viruses was detected. Columbid alphaherpesvirus 1 was detected from a powerful owl (Ninox strenua) with inclusion body hepatitis, and an avian paramyxovirus most similar to Avian avulavirus 5 was detected from a musk lorikeet (Glossopsitta concinna). Two distinct novel avian alphaherpesviruses were detected in samples from a sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita) and a tawny frogmouth (Podargus strigoides). Avian influenza viruses and avian coronaviruses were not detected. The clinical significance of the newly detected viruses remains undetermined. Further studies are needed to assess the host specificity, epidemiology, pathogenicity and host-pathogen relationships of these novel viruses. Further genome characterization is also indicated, and would be required before these viruses can be formally classified taxonomically. The detection of these viruses contributes to our knowledge on avian virodiversity. The low level of avian virus detection, and the absence of any viruses with zoonotic potential, suggests low risk to biosecurity and human health."
https://openalex.org/W2790717594,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the entrapment of apolipoprotein B–containing lipoproteins in the arterial intima, leading to local inflammation. T helper (Th) cell 1–mediated immune responses have been associated with atherosclerosis, and the cytokine interleukin-25 (IL-25 or IL-17E) has been reported to potentially regulate Th1 cell– and Th17 cell–related immune responses. In this study, we evaluated the effects of complete IL-25 deficiency or of a temporal IL-25 blockade on atherosclerosis development in apolipoprotein E–deficient (Apoe−/−) mice. Mice deficient in both apolipoprotein E and IL-25 (Apoe−/−/IL-25−/−) had more Th1 cells in the spleen, along with elevated plasma levels of IL-17 and an increased release of splenic interferon-γ (INF-γ). In support of this observation, a 4-week-long treatment of young Apoe−/− mice (at 10–14 weeks of age) with an IL-25–blocking antibody increased the release of Th1/Th17-associated cytokines in the spleen. In both mouse models, these findings were associated with increased atherosclerotic plaque formation in the aortic arch. We conclude that complete IL-25 deficiency and a temporal IL-25 blockade during early plaque development aggravate atherosclerosis development in the aortic arch of Apoe−/− mice, accompanied by an increase in Th1/Th17-mediated immune responses.

https://openalex.org/W2791452308,"Low bone mineral density (BMD) is a risk factor of osteoporotic fracture (OF). Peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) can differentiate into osteoclasts to resorb bone. It was known that PBM-expressed Anxa2 protein is associated with BMD, and extracellular Anxa2 protein promotes osteoclastogenesis. This study aimed to test 1) whether Anxa2 protein level in PBM differs significantly between subjects with OF and without fracture history (NF); 2) whether Anxa2 level in plasma is associated with BMD; 3) how Anxa2 protein at various concentrations would affect osteoblastic activity in vitro. All the study subjects were Chinese Han elderly. Firstly, Anxa2 protein in PBM was identified and quantitated by LC-MS/MS and compared between 45 OF cases and 42 healthy controls. Secondly, plasma Anxa2 protein level was quantitated by ELISA and compared between unrelated subjects with extremely low vs. high hip BMD (0.63±0.10 vs. 1.05±0.10 g/cm2, n = 75). Furthermore, in vitro functional assay was utilized to test the effects of extracellular Anxa2 protein on osteoblastic growth. We found that Anxa2 protein expression in PBM was significantly up-regulated in OF vs. NF subjects (fold change [FC)] = 1.16, P<0.05). Plasma Anxa2 protein concentration (range: 31.69–227.35ng/ml) was significantly elevated in low vs. high BMD subjects (84.85 vs. 66.15ng/ml, FC = 1.28, P<0.05). Cellular dynamical monitoring demonstrated that the general shape of dose-response relationship is the inverse U-shaped curve. Specifically, lower dose of Anxa2 protein may promote osteoblast growth and the optimal concentration for osteoblastic growth was around 50ng/ml, but even higher concentration could attenuate hFOB1.19 osteoprogenitor cell growth. We concluded that Anxa2 protein could attenuate osteoblast growth and be associated with hip BMD and OF in Chinese elderly."
https://openalex.org/W2793306448,"Background The growing shale gas (“fracking”) industry depends on a mobile workforce, whose influx could have social impacts on host communities. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can increase through sexual mixing patterns associated with labor migration. No prior studies have quantified the relationship between shale gas activity and rates of three reportable STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Methods We conducted a longitudinal, ecologic study from 2000–2016 in Ohio, situated in a prolific shale gas region in the United States (US). Data on reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis by county and year were obtained from the Ohio Department of Health. All 88 counties were classified as none, low, and high shale gas activity in each year, using data from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Annual rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated from mixed-effects Poisson regression models evaluating the relationship between shale gas activity and reported annual STI rates while adjusting for secular trends and potential confounders obtained from the US Census. Results Compared to counties with no shale gas activity, counties with high activity had 21% (RR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.08–1.36) increased rates of chlamydia and 19% (RR = 1.27; 95%CI 0.98–1.44) increased rates of gonorrhea, respectively. No association was observed for syphilis. Conclusion This first report of a link between shale gas activity and increased rates of both chlamydia and gonorrhea may inform local policies and community health efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2802879592,"Lifestyle interventions in type 2 diabetes (DM2) prevention implementation studies can be effective and lasting. Long-term weight loss maintenance enhances the intervention effect through a significant decrease in diabetes incidence over time. Our objective was to identify factors predicting long-term successful weight reduction maintenance achieved during a DM2 prevention program in patients with high DM2 risk in primary health care. Study participants (n = 263), middle-aged, slightly obese with baseline increased DM2 risk (Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC)>14), but no diabetes were invited to receive 11 lifestyle counselling sessions, guided physical activity sessions and motivational support during 10-months. The study participants had three clinical examinations during the study (baseline, one and three years). Stepwise regression analysis was used to determine demographic, clinical, and lifestyle predictors of weight reduction maintenance two years after the discontinuation of the intervention. Out of 105 patients who completed all three examinations (baseline age 56.6 (standard deviation (SD) = 10.7), body mass index 31.1 kg/m2 (SD = 4.9), FINDRISC 18.6 (SD = 3.1)), 73 patients (70%) showed weight loss during the intervention (mean weight loss 4.2 kg, SD = 5.1). The total weight loss achieved in the maintainers (27 of 73 study participants) two years after the intervention had finished was 6.54 kg (4.47 kg+2.0 kg). The non-maintainers, on the other hand, returned to their initial weight at the start of the intervention (+0.21 kg). In multivariable analysis baseline history of increased glucose (odds ratio (OR) = 3.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-13.6) and reduction of total fat in diet during follow-up (OR = 4.3; 95% CI 1.5-12.2) were independent predictors of successful weight loss.

https://openalex.org/W2789939795,"Historically, blood has been a powerful symbol, conferring familial membership, bestowing the right to rule, and representing human vitality. Throughout both history and literature, from Sleeping Beauty to Harry Potter, a drop of blood has often had immense consequence. Beyond these fantastical purposes, blood is indeed growing in power, with multiple recent advances harnessing the potential of scientific discoveries to use patients’ blood to detect a plethora of diseases, from malaria to cancer. The harnessing of blood to diagnose physical conditions is not new. The complete blood count (CBC) is routine, and blood counting as a diagnostic method has been in use since the 19th century. Other common blood tests in the clinic include those for liver function, blood glucose levels, and prostate cancer. These tests exploit various components of blood, including cell-free DNA, secreted proteins, and characteristics of blood cells themselves. Using the same underlying premise, but by combining novel scientific discoveries and technological advances, researchers today are greatly expanding the capability of blood tests to illuminate the state of our health. In a recent study published in Science, Joshua Cohen et al. have advanced the utility of liquid biopsies to detect and even distinguish multiple cancers (Cohen et al., 2018Cohen J.D. Li L. Wang Y. Thoburn C. Afsari B. Danilova L. Douville C. Javed A.A. Wong F. Mattox A. et al.Detection and localization of surgically resectable cancers with a multi-analyte blood test.Science. 2018; 359: 926-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). The authors developed a new blood test, termed CancerSEEK, which combines assays for 2,001 common driver mutations with assessment of eight cancer-associated protein biomarkers, synergizing to successfully identify eight cancer types at various stages with an overall detection sensitivity of 55%. Excitingly, the results of CancerSEEK, when combined with a supervised machine-learning approach, were sufficient to localize the anatomic site of the tumor in a large majority of cases. Importantly for a screening approach, the test is estimated to cost less than $500, suggesting that CancerSEEK and its derivatives may represent cost-effective first-pass diagnostic methodologies for the array of cancer types responsible for 60% of cancer deaths in the United States. However, prospective studies of large populations of individuals over time will be required to fully establish the clinical utility of this blood test for early diagnosis and intervention. Protein biomarkers, like those utilized in CancerSEEK and the traditional prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test for prostate cancer have long been attractive approaches for cancer diagnosis. However, biomarkers also hold promise for diagnoses beyond malignancy. Indeed, work from Katsuhiko Yanagisawa and colleagues recently published in Nature extends the utility of blood tests for detection of amyloid-β biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (Nakamura et al., 2018Nakamura A. Kaneko N. Villemagne V.L. Kato T. Doecke J. Doré V. Fowler C. Li Q.X. Martins R. Rowe C. et al.High performance plasma amyloid-β biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease.Nature. 2018; 554: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Such a simple diagnostic is needed to facilitate clinical trials and drug development, as therapeutic interventions are likely to have strongest effect at early stages of disease, and consistent inexpensive monitoring will provide valuable insight into efficacy. In this work, the authors improve upon prior IP-MS-based methods to detect plasma Aβ by creating a composite biomarker consisting of two protein fragment ratios (APP669–711/Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40/Aβ1–42) with improved ability to distinguish Aβ+ from Aβ− patient groups verified by gold-standard imaging diagnosis. The composite biomarker further correlates with levels of brain Aβ burden, demonstrating potential utility for clinical screening and longitudinal monitoring. The CancerSEEK and Alzheimer’s disease blood tests together demonstrate the utility of combinatorial approaches, i.e., composite biomarkers, to improve sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis. However, beyond searching for danger signals in the blood, an additional dimension of information that can be leveraged for diagnostics are the qualities of blood cells themselves. In this vein, recent work from Jochen Guck and colleagues harnesses the physical properties of various blood cells to diagnose diseases using a single drop of blood simply diluted in buffer (Toepfner et al., 2018Toepfner N. Herold C. Otto O. Rosendahl P. Jacobi A. Kräter M. Stächele J. Menschner L. Herbig M. Ciuffreda L. et al.Detection of human disease conditions by single-cell morpho-rheological phenotyping of blood.eLife. 2018; 7: e29213Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). By coupling micro-channel blood flow with real-time deformability cytometry, the researchers are able to detect erythrocyte deformation changes caused by spherocytosis or malaria infection, two conditions traditionally diagnosed manually by blood smear followed by secondary assays. They extend this approach to analyze leukocyte mechanics as a diagnostic, distinguishing morpho-rheological (MORE) characteristics of white blood cells after bacterial and viral infection as well as after malignant transformation. The utility of this approach, which is currently highly sensitive but less specific, will only grow with future discoveries regarding the pathogenesis of myriad conditions that impact MORE characteristics of blood cells, making MORE phenotyping an intriguing clinical advance for a broad array of conditions. The potential clinical utility for these and other blood tests is substantial. In fact, just last month the FDA approved marketing for the Banyan Brain Trauma Indicator, the first ever blood test to detect mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in adults (Federal Drug Administration, 2018Federal Drug Administration (2018 February 14). FDA authorizes marketing of first blood test to aid in the evaluation of concussion in adults. [Press release]. Retrieved from https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm596531.htm.Google Scholar). This test is based on detection of two protein biomarkers, UCH-L1 and GFAP, which are rapidly released in the blood upon traumatic brain injury (www.banyanbio.com). Given the severe consequences of traumatic brain injury, which have been recently highlighted in particular in the context of professional athletes, an inexpensive and rapid first-pass diagnostic is a vast improvement over invasive and expensive CT imaging. With the rapid pace of discovery in disease pathogenesis research as well as consistent developments in bioengineering and technical invention, the prognosis for blood tests is exceedingly positive. A notable theme from these recent works is the finding that combinatorial approaches are often the most effective, with composite biomarkers universally performing better than single proteins. Thus, it is imperative to continue basic research into disease pathogenesis to extend the toolkit with which scientists can work to develop diagnostics and therapeutics. With improved understanding of the havoc wreaked on our bodies by infection, degeneration and tumorigenesis, scientists will know just what to look for, and complementary technologies will allow them to do so. Hopefully, with just a drop of blood, doctors of the future may be able to detect and understand complex pathologies throughout the human body."
https://openalex.org/W2791284434,"Objectives To adapt and refine a previously-developed youth-specific algorithm to identify bedrest for use in adults. The algorithm is based on using an automated decision tree (DT) analysis of accelerometry data. Design Healthy adults (n = 141, 85 females, 19–69 years-old) wore accelerometers on the waist, with a subset also wearing accelerometers on the dominant wrist (n = 45). Participants spent ≈24-h in a whole-room indirect calorimeter equipped with a force-platform floor to detect movement. Methods Minute-by-minute data from recordings of waist-worn or wrist-worn accelerometers were used to identify bedrest and wake periods. Participants were randomly allocated to development (n = 69 and 23) and validation (n = 72 and 22) groups for waist-worn and wrist-worn accelerometers, respectively. The optimized DT algorithm parameters were block length, threshold, bedrest-start trigger, and bedrest-end trigger. Differences between DT classification and synchronized objective classification by the room calorimeter to bedrest or wake were assessed for sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy using a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) procedure applied to 1-min epochs (n = 92,543 waist; n = 30,653 wrist). Results The optimal algorithm parameter values for block length were 60 and 45 min, thresholds 12.5 and 400 counts/min, bedrest-start trigger 120 and 400 counts/min, and bedrest-end trigger 1,200 and 1,500 counts/min, for the waist and wrist-worn accelerometers, respectively. Bedrest was identified correctly in the validation group with sensitivities of 0.819 and 0.912, specificities of 0.966 and 0.923, and accuracies of 0.755 and 0.859 by the waist and wrist-worn accelerometer, respectively. The DT algorithm identified bedrest/sleep with greater accuracy than a commonly used automated algorithm (Cole-Kripke) for wrist-worn accelerometers (p<0.001). Conclusions The adapted DT accurately identifies bedrest in data from accelerometers worn by adults on either the wrist or waist. The automated bedrest/sleep detection DT algorithm for both youth and adults is openly accessible as a package “PhysActBedRest” for the R-computer language."
https://openalex.org/W2793270353,"Objective To correlate the value of lactate in fetal scalp blood at delivery and the outcomes of the offspring at four years of age. Methods Cases where scalp blood lactate was taken within sixty minutes before delivery were identified from the randomized trial ""Determination of pH or lactate in fetal scalp blood in management of intrapartum fetal distress”. Data were grouped according to the generally accepted cutoffs for normality, pre-acidemia, acidemia and concentrations above mean +2 SD during the second stage. The outcome measures included gross-/fine motor function, vision, hearing, speaking and cognitive disorders, signs of central motor damage and referral to specialized pediatric services. Results 307 cases were available for final analyse. With normal scalp lactate concentration, the number of children with a diagnosed disorder was lower compared to the pre-acidemic/acidemic groups, although the findings were only significant for fine motor dysfunction (p = 0.036). Elevated lactate values were significantly associated with increased risk for a poorer capacity of attention and understanding of instructions (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07–1.74), and for fine motor dysfunction (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.00–1.49) at the age of four. Conclusion Higher levels of lactate in fetal scalp blood seems to be associated with increased risk of an aberrant developmental outcome at four years of age in some areas."
https://openalex.org/W2791246296,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether or not surgical biopsy of sinus tissue in chronic sinusitis, not responsive to treatment, would detect E. coli. We intended to evaluate E. coli virulence genes, therefore dispute the causal role of such an unusual microorganism in chronic sinusitis, as well as consider effective pathogen-targeted therapy. Patients with E. coli isolated by intra-operative puncture biopsy were included in the study. Genetic analysis of E. coli isolates, including phylogenetic grouping and virulence factor characteristics, were done by multiplex PCR. We identified 26 patients with chronic sinusitis, in which 26 E. coli isolates were cultured. The E. coli isolates belonged mainly to pathogenic phylogenetic group B2, and carried multiple virulence genes. Three genes in particular were present in all (100%) of examined isolates, they were (1) marker agn43 gene for forming biofilm, (2) type 1 fimbriae (fimG/H gene) and (3) yersiniabactin receptor (fyuA). Furthermore, a pseudo-phylogenetic tree of virulence genes distribution revealed possible cooperation between agn43, fimG/H, and fyuA in the coding of biofilm formation. Intra-operative-biopsy and culture-based therapy, targeting the isolated E. coli, coincided with long-term resolution of symptoms. This is the first report demonstrating an association between a highly pathogenic E. coli, chronic sinus infection, and resolution of symptoms upon E. coli targeted therapy, a significant finding due to the fact that E. coli has not been considered to be a commensal organism of the oropharynx or sinuses. We postulate that the simultaneous presence of three genes, each coding biofilm formation, may in part account for the chronicity of E. coli sinusitis."

https://openalex.org/W2793940788,"Foot and mouth disease (FMD) has devastated the cattle industry in Sri Lanka many times in the past. Despite its seriousness, limited attempts have been made to understand the disease to ameliorate its effects–current recommendation for vaccines being based solely on immunological assessments rather than on molecular identification. The general belief is that the cattle population in Sri Lanka acquired the FMD virus (FMDV) strains via introductions from India. However, there could be endemic FMDV lineages circulating in Sri Lanka. To infer the phylogenetic relationships of the FMDV strains in the island, we sequenced the VP1 genomic region of the virus isolates collected during the 2014 outbreak together with a few reported cases in 2012 and 1997 and compared them to VP1 sequences from South Asia. The FMDV strains collected in the 2014 outbreak belonged to the lineage, Ind-2001d, of the topotype, ME-SA. The strains collected in 2012 and 1997 belonged to another lineage called 'unnamed' by the World Reference Laboratory for Foot and Mouth Disease (WRLFMD). Based on the present analysis, we designate the lineage 'unnamed' as Srl-97 which we found endemic to Sri Lanka. The evolutionary rates of Srl-97 and Ind-2001d in Sri Lanka were estimated to be 0.0004 and 0.0046 substitutions/site/year, respectively, suggesting that Srl-97 evolves slowly."
https://openalex.org/W2792657571,"We conducted a document analysis that explored publication ethics and authorship in the context of population biobanks from both a theoretical (e.g. normative documents) and practical (e.g. biobank-specific documentation) perspective. The aim was to provide an overview of the state of authorship attribution in population biobanks and attempt to fill the gap in discussions around the issue. Our findings demonstrate that the most common approach adopted in both the normative and biobank-specific documentation is acknowledgment. A co-authorship approach was second and highlighted concerns surrounding the fairness of imposing authorship of the scientific leadership as a condition to access data and biosamples, as well as the alignment with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors’ criteria such as what is deemed a significant contribution and how to ensure accountability. Based on these findings, we propose a three-prong approach, that may be cumulative, to address the issue of authorship attribution in the context of population biobanks, namely 1) the biobank should be appropriately acknowledged; 2) an invitation for co-authorship should be made based on the spirit of collaboration and provided a substantial contribution has been made; and 3) a citation/referencing option should be available."
https://openalex.org/W2793329396,"Mirror exposure (ME) is one of the main components of the treatment of patients with eating disorders symptomatology and it has shown its effectiveness in improving several outcomes (e.g., body dissatisfaction). However, the study as to what body posture should be adopted to maximize its effectiveness has been neglected. From embodied cognition and emotion theories, the adoption of an expansive (vs. contractive) body posture has been associated with positive changes in cognitive and emotional responses. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of adopting an expansive (vs. contractive) posture before an ME task on body-related emotions and cognitions, as well as to analyze the possible moderator and mediator variables of these relationships. The sample was composed of 68 women (age: M = 21.74, SD = 3.12) with high scores on body dissatisfaction. Participants were randomly assigned to the expansive or contractive condition, where the openness of the arms/legs and the back position were manipulated. Posture was monitored by an electronic device and participants filled out several self-reported measures. ANCOVAs, moderation, mediation, and moderated mediated analyses were performed. Results showed that women in the expansive condition showed higher positive emotions after the ME. Moreover, exploratory analyses showed that adopting an expansive posture improved positive emotions, leading to improvements in negative emotions, body image satisfaction, and appraisal of the person's own body. Psychological interventions should explore the value of holding an expansive posture before the ME in women with body dissatisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W2789620378,"Antigenic variation in viral surface antigens is a strategy for escaping the host's adaptive immunity, whereas regions with pivotal functions for infection are less subject to antigenic variability. We hypothesized that genetically invariable and immunologically dormant regions of a viral surface antigen could be exposed to the host immune system and activated by rendering them susceptible to antigen-processing machinery in professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Considering the frequent antigen drift and shift in influenza viruses, we identified and used structural modeling to evaluate the conserved regions on the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) surface as potential epitopes. Mutant viruses containing the cleavage motifs of cathepsin S within HA were generated. Immunization of mice showed that the mutant, but not the wild-type virus, elicited specific antibodies against the cryptic epitope. Those antibodies were purified, and specific binding to HA was confirmed. These results suggest that an unnatural immune response can be elicited through the processing of target antigens in APCs, followed by presentation via the major histocompatibility complex, if not subjected to regulatory pathways. By harnessing the antigen-processing machinery, our study shows a proof-of-principle for designer vaccines with increased efficacy and safety by either activating cryptic, or inactivating naturally occurring, epitopes of viral antigens.-Lee, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2789504645,"Increase in the elderly population and early retirement imposes immense economic burden on societies. Previous studies on the association between medical expenditure and working status in the elderly population have not adequately addressed reverse causality problem. In addition, the pre-elderly group has hardly been discussed in this regard. This study assessed possible causal association between employment status and medical expenditure as well as employment status and medical unmet needs in a representative sample of the Korean elderly (aged≧65) and the pre-elderly (aged ≧50 and < 65) adults from the Korea Health Panel Data (KHP). Dynamic panel Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation was employed for the analysis of medical expenditure to address reverse causality, and fixed effect panel logistic regression was used for the analysis of unmet need. The results showed no significant association between job status and medical expenditure in the elderly, but a negative and significant influence on the level of medical expenditure in the pre-elderly. Unemployment was a significant determinant of lowering unmet need from lack of time while it was not associated with unmet need from financial burden in the fixed-effect panel model for both the elderly and pre-elderly groups. The pre-elderly adults were more likely to reduce necessary health service utilization due to unemployment compared to the elderly group because there is no proper financial safety net for the pre-elderly, which may cause non-adherence to treatment and therefore lead to negative health effects. The policy dialogue on safety net currently centers only on the elderly, but should be extended to the pre-elderly population."
https://openalex.org/W2790104254,"To investigate the usefulness of addition type liquid silicone rubber (ATLSR) as injectable implant after evisceration to maintain the eyeball volume in an animal experiment.Twelve adult New Zealand white rabbits were included. One eye of each rabbit was randomly selected for evisceration with the fellow eye as control. ATLSR was injected to fill the eyeball socket after evisceration. In vivo observation and photographs were performed up to 24 weeks post-op. Two rabbits were sacrificed respectively at post-operative week 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24. After enucleation, the vertical, horizontal and sagittal diameters of the experimental eyeballs were measured and compared with the control eyes. Histopathological studies were performed to evaluate signs of inflammation.Cornea remained clear throughout the observation period despite mild epithelial edema and neovascularization. Compared to the control eyes, the experimental eyes were significantly smaller in vertical diameter (17.00±1.17 vs. 17.54±1.11 mm, P<0.001), but larger in sagittal diameter (16.85±1.48 vs. 16.40±1.38 mm, P = 0.008), and had no significant difference in horizontal diameter (17.49±1.53 vs. 17.64±1.21 mm, P = 0.34). Postoperative inflammation was observed at one week after surgery, which peaked at 2-3 weeks, then regressed gradually. At week 12 and week 24, most of the inflammatory cells disappeared with some residual plasma cells and eosinophils.Injectable addition type silicon rubber may be a good choice for ocular implantation after evisceration, maintaining eyeball volume and cosmetically satisfactory when compared to the fellow eye. Spontaneous regression of inflammation implied good biocompatibility for at least 24 weeks."
https://openalex.org/W2793450755,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease, and survival signatures are urgently needed to better monitor treatment. MiRNAs displayed vital regulatory roles on target genes, which was necessary involved in the complex disease. We therefore examined the expression levels of miRNAs and genes to identify robust signatures for survival benefit analyses. First, we reconstructed subpathway graphs by embedding miRNA components that were derived from low-throughput miRNA-gene interactions. Then, we randomly divided the data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) into training and testing sets, and further formed 100 subsets based on the training set. Using each subset, we identified survival-related miRNAs and genes, and identified survival subpathways based on the reconstructed subpathway graphs. After statistical analyses of these survival subpathways, the most robust subpathways with the top three ranks were identified, and risk scores were calculated based on these robust subpathways for AML patient prognoses. Among these robust subpathways, three representative subpathways, path: 05200_10 from Pathways in cancer, path: 04110_20 from Cell cycle, and path: 04510_8 from Focal adhesion, were significantly associated with patient survival in the TCGA training and testing sets based on subpathway risk scores. In conclusion, we performed integrated analyses of miRNAs and genes to identify robust prognostic subpathways, and calculated subpathway risk scores to characterize AML patient survival."
https://openalex.org/W2789249280,"Transcription as the key step in gene expression is a highly regulated process. The speed of transcription elongation depends on the underlying gene sequence and varies on a gene by gene basis. The reason for this sequence dependence is not known in detail. Recently, our group studied the cross talk between the nascent RNA and the transcribing RNA polymerase by screening the Escherichia coli genome for RNA sequences with high affinity to RNA Pol by performing genomic SELEX. This approach led to the identification of RNA polymerase-binding APtamers termed ""RAPs"". RAPs can have positive and negative effects on gene expression. A subgroup is able to downregulate transcription via the activity of the termination factor Rho. In this study, we used a similar SELEX setup using yeast genomic DNA as source of RNA sequences and highly purified yeast RNA Pol II as bait and obtained almost 1300 yeast-derived RAPs. Yeast RAPs are found throughout the genome within genes and antisense to genes, they are overrepresented in the non-transcribed strand of yeast telomeres and underrepresented in intergenic regions. Genes harbouring a RAP are more likely to show lower mRNA levels. By determining the endogenous expression levels as well as using a reporter system, we show that RAPs located within coding regions can reduce the transcript level downstream of the RAP. Here we demonstrate that RAPs represent a novel type of regulatory RNA signal in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that act in cis and interfere with the elongating transcription machinery to reduce the transcriptional output."
https://openalex.org/W2792612986,"In recent years, an increasing number of studies has investigated majority influence in nonhuman animals. However, due to both terminological and methodological issues, evidence for conformity in nonhuman animals is scarce and controversial. Preliminary evidence suggests that wild birds, wild monkeys, and fish show conformity, that is, forgoing personal information in order to copy the majority. By contrast, chimpanzees seem to lack this tendency. The present study is the first to examine whether dogs (Canis familiaris) show conformity. Specifically, we tested whether dogs conform to a majority of conspecifics rather than stick to what they have previously learned. After dogs had acquired a behavioral preference via training (i.e., shaping), they were confronted with counter-preferential behavior of either no, one or three conspecifics. Traditional frequentist analyses show that the dogs' behavior did not differ significantly between the three conditions. Complementary Bayesian analyses suggest that our data provide moderate evidence for the null hypothesis. In conclusion, our results suggest that dogs stick to what they have learned rather than conform to the counter-preferential behavior of others. We discuss the possible statistical and methodological limitations of this finding. Furthermore, we take a functional perspective on conformity and discuss under which circumstances dogs might show conformity after all."
https://openalex.org/W2793463154,"Next generation sequencing (NGS) is becoming increasingly integrated into oncological practice and clinical research. NGS methods have also provided evidence for clonal evolution of cancers during disease progression and treatment. The number of variants associated with response to specific therapeutic agents keeps increasing. However, the identification of novel driver mutations as opposed to passenger (phenotypically silent or clinically irrelevant) mutations remains a major challenge. We conducted targeted exome sequencing of advanced solid tumors from 44 pre-treated patients with solid tumors including breast, colorectal and lung carcinomas, neuroendocrine tumors, sarcomas and others. We catalogued established driver mutations and putative new drivers as predicted by two distinct algorithms. The established drivers we detected were consistent with published observations. However, we also detected a significant number of mutations with driver potential never described before in each tumor type we studied. These putative drivers belong to key cell fate regulatory networks, including potentially druggable pathways. Should our observations be confirmed, they would support the hypothesis that new driver mutations are selected by treatment in clinically aggressive tumors, and indicate a need for longitudinal genomic testing of solid tumors to inform second line cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2792383867,"Background Spreadsheet software is increasingly used to implement systems science models informing health policy decisions, both in academia and in practice where technical capacity may be limited. However, spreadsheet models are prone to unintentional errors that may not always be identified using standard error-checking techniques. Our objective was to illustrate, through a methodologic case study analysis, the impact of unintentional errors on model projections by implementing parallel model versions. Methods We leveraged a real-world need to revise an existing spreadsheet model designed to inform HIV policy. We developed three parallel versions of a previously validated spreadsheet-based model; versions differed by the spreadsheet cell-referencing approach (named single cells; column/row references; named matrices). For each version, we implemented three model revisions (re-entry into care; guideline-concordant treatment initiation; immediate treatment initiation). After standard error-checking, we identified unintentional errors by comparing model output across the three versions. Concordant model output across all versions was considered error-free. We calculated the impact of unintentional errors as the percentage difference in model projections between model versions with and without unintentional errors, using +/-5% difference to define a material error. Results We identified 58 original and 4,331 propagated unintentional errors across all model versions and revisions. Over 40% (24/58) of original unintentional errors occurred in the column/row reference model version; most (23/24) were due to incorrect cell references. Overall, >20% of model spreadsheet cells had material unintentional errors. When examining error impact along the HIV care continuum, the percentage difference between versions with and without unintentional errors ranged from +3% to +16% (named single cells), +26% to +76% (column/row reference), and 0% (named matrices). Conclusions Standard error-checking techniques may not identify all errors in spreadsheet-based models. Comparing parallel model versions can aid in identifying unintentional errors and promoting reliable model projections, particularly when resources are limited."
