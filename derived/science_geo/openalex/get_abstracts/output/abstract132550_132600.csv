https://openalex.org/W2153899018,"We have recently reported that angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation is mainly mediated by Ca2+-dependent activation of a protein tyrosine kinase through Gq-coupled Ang II type 1 receptor in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). In the present study, we found Ang II rapidly induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and its association with Shc and Grb2. These reactions were inhibited by the EGF receptor kinase inhibitor, AG1478. The Ang II-induced phosphorylation of the EGF receptor was mimicked by a Ca2+ionophore and completely inhibited by an intracellular Ca2+chelator. Thus, AG1478 abolished the MAPK activation induced by Ang II, a Ca2+ ionophore as well as EGF but not by a phorbol ester or platelet-derived growth factor-BB in the VSMC. Moreover, Ang II induced association of EGF receptor with catalytically active c-Src. This reaction was not affected by AG1478. These data indicate that Ang II induces Ca2+-dependent transactivation of the EGF receptor which serves as a scaffold for pre-activated c-Src and for downstream adaptors, leading to MAPK activation in VSMC.

Protein tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent protein-protein interaction induced by growth factors is a prototypical pathway to transmit mitogenic signals to the nucleus (1Pawson T.

For example, tyrosine phosphorylation of growth factor receptors recruits the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, son-of-sevenless (Sos) 1The abbreviations used are: Sos, son-of-sevenless; MAPK/ERK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Ang II, angiotensin II; AT1, angiotensin II type 1 receptor; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PLC, phospholipase C; EGF, epidermal growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody. through adaptor proteins, Shc and Grb2, thereby initiating a sequential cascade from p21ras (Ras) to mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), referred to as p44mapk (ERK1) and p42mapk (ERK2) (2Schlessinger J.

Angiotensin II (Ang II), a major effector peptide of the renin-angiotensin system, is now believed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular remodeling associated with hypertension, heart failure, and atherosclerosis (7Goodfriend T.L.

In cultured VSMC, AT1 activates phospholipase C (PLC), which initiates the generation of inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, causing intracellular calcium mobilization and protein kinase C activation, respectively (16Griendling K.K.

Although AT1 lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, it appeared to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple signaling proteins (24Molloy C.J. Taylor D.S. Weber H. J. Biol.

In fact, recent works with various GPCR including AT1 suggest that GPCR-induced MAPK activation requires Shc-Grb2·Sos and/or Grb2·Sos complex formation and subsequent Ras activation mediated by several candidate tyrosine kinases, such as proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) (30Lev S.

We have recently reported that Ang II-induced Ras and MAPK activation is mainly mediated by a calcium-dependent protein tyrosine kinase through Gq-mediated PLC activation via AT1 in cultured rat quiescent VSMC (36Eguchi S. Matsumoto T. Motley E.D. Utsunomiya H. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). However, the identity of the tyrosine kinase and its pathophysiological significance in the growth promoting signal of Ang II have remained unclear. In the present study, we found that Ang II induces Ca2+-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor to recruit Shc and Grb2, thereby activating MAPK in VSMC. The transactivation of the EGF receptor seems to be an essential point of convergence in this growth promoting cascade because it provides docking sites for the upstream tyrosine kinase c-Src and downstream adaptors at the plasma membrane, and because its activity is required for the MAPK activation induced by Ang II. Chemicals and reagents were obtained from the following sources: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin from Life Technologies, Inc.; Ang II from Peninsula Laboratories; recombinant human EGF and PDGF-BB from Upstate Biotechnology Inc.; AG1478, AG1295, A23187, and BAPTA-AM from Calbiochem; phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and EGTA from Sigma; an agarose-conjugated glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-Grb2-(1–217) fusion protein and protein A/G-agarose from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. CV11974 was a generous gift of Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. The rabbit polyclonal phospho-specific MAPK antibody (9101) raised against a synthetic phosphotyrosine peptide corresponding to amino acids 196–209 (DHTGFLTEY(P)VATRWC, where P indicates phosphate) of human p44 MAPK (ERK1) was obtained from New England Biolabs that detects only the catalytically active form of p42/44 MAPKs which are phosphorylated at Tyr204. We have previously shown (36Eguchi S. Matsumoto T. Motley E.D. Utsunomiya H. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) that this antibody specifically recognizes Tyr204-phosphorylated p42/44 MAPK in cultured rat VSMC. Anti-EGF receptor polyclonal antibody (pAb)(1005) raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 1005–1016 of human EGF receptor (identical to the corresponding mouse sequence) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology that also specifically recognizes rat EGF receptor in both immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Anti-Shc pAb (06-203) and monoclonal antibody (mAb) (S52420: clone 8) raised against a GST-tagged fusion protein corresponding to the SH2 domain (amino acid residues 366–473) of the human p46/p52 Shc was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology and Transduction Laboratories, respectively. Anti-Shc pAb specifically reacts with p46/52/66 Shc of rat origin by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation (34Sadoshima J. Izumo S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 37Schorb W. Peeler T.C. Madigan N.N. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol.

Anti-Grb2 pAb (C-23) raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 195–217 of human Grb2 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology that is also specific for Grb2 of the rat origin by immunoprecipitation (34Sadoshima J. Izumo S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar,38Rosen L.B. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Anti-Grb2 mAb (G16720: clone 24) raised against the entire 24-kDa Grb2 protein from rat brain was obtained from Transduction Laboratories that specifically reacts with rat Grb2 by immunoblotting (30Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). Anti-Sos pAbs (S15530) raised against a protein fragment of mouse Sos1 corresponding to amino acid residues 1–109 and a protein fragment of mouse Sos2 corresponding to amino acid residues 1095–1297, respectively, were obtained from Transduction Laboratories that also specifically react with Sos1 and Sos2 of rat origin by immunoblotting (34Sadoshima J. Izumo S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Anti-PDGF β receptor pAb (06-498) raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 1013–1025 of human PDGF β receptor was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. It specifically reacts with PDGF β receptor by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. We have previously confirmed that this antibody also specifically reacts with rat PDGF β receptor in cultured rat VSMC (39Inui H. Kitami Y. Kondo T. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17045-17050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mAb directed to Tyr530-dephosphorylated c-Src (clone 28) was prepared as described previously which selectively recognizes the active form of rat c-Src (40Kawakatsu H. Sakai T. Takagaki Y. Shinoda Y. Saito M. Owada M.K. Yano J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5680-5685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated recombinant antibody fragment specific for phosphotyrosine (RC20) and anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10) were from Transduction Laboratories and Upstate Biotechnology Inc., respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The specificities of the antibodies used in the present study have been described in publications as referred to above as well as elsewhere. In addition, the rabbit pAbs used in the present immunoprecipitation studies (1005, 06-203, C-23), except control normal rabbit IgG or the pAb preincubated with its immunogen, specifically immunoprecipitated target proteins that, upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, migrated to positions calculated from their molecular weights when visualized by the respective pAbs (1005) or mAbs (S52420, G16720) used in the present immunoblotting studies (Fig. 4 C and data not shown), thus confirming that the precipitated proteins are specific to the precipitating antibodies and that the bands detected by the blotting antibodies are specifically recognized by the antibodies. VSMC were prepared from the thoracic aorta of 12-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories) by the explant method and cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin as described previously (41Eguchi S. Hirata Y. Imai T. Kanno K. Marumo F. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Subcultured VSMC from passages 3–15, used in the experiments, showed >99% positive immunostaining of smooth muscle α-actin antibody and were negative for mycoplasma infection. The expression of AT1 but not AT2 receptors was confirmed on the basis of binding studies with specific receptor antagonists (36Eguchi S. Matsumoto T. Motley E.D. Utsunomiya H. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Cells at ∼80% confluence in culture wells were made quiescent by incubation with serum-free DMEM for 3 days. VSMC grown on a 24-well plate were stimulated with agonists at 37 °C in serum-free DMEM for specified durations. The reaction was terminated by the replacement of medium with the ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After brief sonication (10 s), the samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was assayed for MAPK activity with an assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that measures the incorporation of [33P]phosphate from [γ-33P]ATP into a synthetic peptide (KRELVEPLTPAGEAPNQALLR) as a specific MAPK substrate (36Eguchi S. Matsumoto T. Motley E.D. Utsunomiya H. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out with the cell lysate (∼1 μg of protein) in 75 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm substrate peptide, and 1.2 mm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. The resultant solution was applied to a phosphocellulose membrane and extensively washed in 1% acetic acid and then in deionized water. The radioactivity trapped on the membrane was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Cells were lysed by adding ice-cold lysis buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mmHEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 100 mm NaF, 30 mm 2-(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 × g. Supernatant was mixed with the immunoprecipitation antibody and rocked at 4 °C for 2–16 h, and then protein A/G-Sepharose was added for an additional 2 h to overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times in the lysis buffer, solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After blocking with 5% milk, the membrane was treated with a primary antibody followed by a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For repeated immunoblotting, membranes were stripped in 62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol for 30–45 min at 50 °C. For immunoblot analysis of MAPK phosphorylation, VSMC grown on a 6-well plate were directly lysed by Laemmli sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and subjected to immunoblotting. For immunoblot analysis of Grb2-associated proteins, agarose-conjugated GST-Grb2 fusion protein was rocked with Triton X-100 lysate of VSMC for 2 h to overnight at 4 °C and washed 3 times with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were solubilized, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and subjected to immunoblotting, as described above. Unless stated otherwise, results are representative of at least three experiments giving similar results. In many MAPK activation systems, a tyrosine-phosphorylated scaffold is needed to assemble adaptor proteins (1Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar, 2Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 3Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Highly likely candidates in VSMC for such a scaffold mediating MAPK activation by Ang II are the PDGF or EGF receptors. In VSMC, Ang II has been shown to cause PDGF β receptor phosphorylation which leads to recruitment of the Shc·Grb2 complex to the receptor (25Linseman D.A. Benjamin C.W. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12563-12568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This pathway may account for Ras and MAPK activation. A recent study revealed that several GPCRs use EGF receptor transactivation for MAPK activation, c-fos induction, and DNA synthesis in Rat-1 fibroblasts (31Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). To clarify the role of these receptor tyrosine kinases in Ang II-induced signal transduction in VSMC, we first tested the effect of selective receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (42Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar) on the MAPK activity in VSMC. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the EGF receptor kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478 dose-dependently and completely blocked EGF-induced MAPK activation, whereas it had no effect on the PDGF-induced activation confirming its stringent selectivity. We then observed marked inhibition of Ang II-induced MAPK activation by AG1478 (Fig. 1 B) but not by the PDGF receptor-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG1295 (Fig. 1 C). AG1478 also inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPK by Ang II and EGF without affecting that by PDGF-BB (Fig. 1 D). Moreover, AG1478 inhibited Ca2+ ionophore (A23187)-induced MAPK activation, whereas it had no effect on the phorbol ester-induced activation (Fig. 1 C). This is in good agreement with our previous observation that the Ang II-induced Ras and MAPK activation requires a Ca2+-sensitive tyrosine kinase but not protein kinase C in VSMC (36Eguchi S. Matsumoto T. Motley E.D. Utsunomiya H. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The activated EGF receptor can recruit the Grb2·Sos complex directly and indirectly via tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, thereby activating the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway (1Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar, 2Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 3Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that Ang II signaling utilizes the EGF receptor to provide a docking site for Grb2, we examined proteins that interact with a GST-Grb2 fusion protein in the lysate of VSMC upon stimulation by Ang II. As shown in Fig. 2 A, Ang II transiently increased association of several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with the GST-Grb2 fusion protein as detected by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The association of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins is specific to Grb2 because no band was seen when GST-agarose alone was used (Fig. 2 D). A similar pattern of Grb2-associating tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was observed following treatment of VSMC with the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187 (Fig. 2 B). The major phosphoprotein (∼170 kDa) associated with the GST-Grb2 fusion protein upon treatment with Ang II was identified as the EGF receptor because it was recognized by the anti-EGF receptor antibody (Fig. 2 C) and was diminished by pretreatment with AG1478 (data not shown). We confirmed that the phosphorylated EGF receptor was coprecipitated with endogenous Grb2 upon Ang II treatment and was also diminished by AG1478 (Fig. 3). It should be noted that the tyrosine-phosphorylated bands of ∼50 kDa were practically wiped out by AG1478, whereas the ∼120-kDa band was not visibly affected (Fig. 3). In cultured rat VSMC, Ang II was shown to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of 46, 52, and 66 kDa Shc isoforms which subsequently form a complex with Grb2 (25Linseman D.A. Benjamin C.W. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12563-12568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The ∼50-kDa phosphoprotein associated with Grb2 upon treatment with Ang II shown in Fig. 3 should be p52 Shc. Indeed, the Ang II treatment resulted in association of 46-, 52-, and 66-kDa Shc isoforms to the GST-Grb2 fusion protein in which p52 Shc was the dominant form in VSMC (Fig. 2 A). A23187 also increased p52 Shc association to the GST-Grb2 fusion protein in VSMC (Fig. 2 B).Figure 3Tyrosine-phosphorylated EGF receptor is coprecipitated with endogenous Grb2 upon Ang II treatment. VSMC were pretreated with or without AG1478 (250 nm) for 30 min and stimulated with Ang II (100 nm) for indicated durations. After cell lysis, immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed with anti-Grb2 pAb. Precipitates were analyzed by repeated immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb, anti-EGF receptor pAb, and anti-Grb2 mAb as indicated.

Nature. 1995; 373: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar, 2Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 3Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar), the Ang II-induced association of the EGF receptor and Shc with the GST-Grb2 fusion protein suggests that Ang II causes tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor. To confirm the involvement of the EGF receptor and to examine the effect of Ang II on the phosphotyrosine content of the EGF receptor, it was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 A, Ang II induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor within 1 min, peaked at 2 min, and declined in 5 min. We further confirmed that the band recognized by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody specifically represents the tyrosine-phosphorylated EGF receptor because neither phosphorylated band nor immunoprecipitated EGF receptor could be observed when immunoprecipitation antibody (anti-EGF receptor antibody) was preabsorbed with its immunogen (Fig. 4 C). Moreover, Ang II increased the amount of Shc, Grb2, and Sos which was coprecipitated with the EGF receptor (Fig. 4 A). The phosphorylation of the EGF receptor was also observed upon treatment of VSMC with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (Fig. 4 B). In good agreement with our previous observation that Ang II-induced Ras and MAPK activation is mainly mediated through intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (36Eguchi S. Matsumoto T. Motley E.D. Utsunomiya H. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), the Ang II-induced phosphorylation of the EGF receptor was completely inhibited by an intracellular Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA-AM, but only partially affected by an extracellular Ca2+ chelator, EGTA (Fig. 4 C). Ang II has been shown to stimulate the secretion of several growth factors in cultured VSMC, some of which have not been identified yet (13Weber H. Taylor D.S. Molloy C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It is possible that the Ang II-induced EGF receptor activation occurs secondarily to autocrine secretion of EGF receptor ligands such as EGF or transforming growth factor-α. Since there are no reliable antibodies to rapidly neutralize multiple endogenous rat EGF receptor ligands (note that the transactivation takes place within 1 min) or to completely neutralize rat EGF receptor, we have excluded this possibility by examining the effect of the Ang II-treated conditioned medium on EGF receptor phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 4 D, the ability of the conditioned medium to phosphorylate the EGF receptor was lost when VSMC was pretreated with the AT1 receptor antagonist, CV11974. Although there exists a small degree of basal phosphorylation of the PDGF β receptor"

By a mechanism of exon sharing, the transcripts of individual first exon cassettes located at the 5′ end of the human UGT1Alocus are spliced to exons 2–5, leading to the expression of at least nine individual UGT genes. Recently, the tissue-specific expression of the UGT1A locus has been demonstrated in extrahepatic tissue, leading to the identification of UGT1A7 and UGT1A10 mRNA (Strassburg, C. P., Oldhafer, K., Manns, M. P., and Tukey, R. H. (1997) Mol. Pharmacol. 52, 212). However,UGT1A expression has not been defined in human colon, which is a metabolically active, external surface organ and a common route of drug administration. UGT1A expression was analyzed in 5 colonic, 16 hepatic, 4 biliary, and 13 gastric human tissue specimens by quantitative duplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, demonstrating lower UGT1A mRNA in the extrahepatic tissues. The precise analysis of unique UGT1A transcripts by exon 1-specific duplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed the expression of UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, and UGT1A9 in the colon, which are also present in human liver. In addition, the expression of extrahepatic UGT1A10 and UGT1A8 was demonstrated. UGT1A8 was found to be closely related to gastric UGT1A7 with a 93.8% identity of first exon sequences. Expressed UGT1A7 and UGT1A10 protein showed unique catalytic activity profiles, while UGT1A8 was not active with the substrates tested. The ability of UGT1A10 to glucuronidate estrone represents only the second example of a human estrone UGT. The highly related human UGT1A7–1A10 cluster is expressed in a tissue-specific fashion and underlines the role and diversity of physiological glucuronidation at the distal end of the digestive tract.

Glucuronidation represents an important process of metabolism capable of transforming lipophilic substrates into hydrophilic glucuronides, a process which facilitates their subsequent elimination via urine, bile, and feces (1Dutton G.J.

The UGT1Alocus 2A recommended nomenclature for the humanUGT1A locus, which was outlined during the VIII International Workshop on Glucuronidation and the UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, Iowa City, May 1996, is used throughout this manuscript. is located on chromosome 2 and potentially encodes nine functional isoforms and three pseudogenes. UGT1A proteins are generated by a strategy of exon sharing (8Owens I.S. Ritter J.K. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1995; 51: 306-338Google Scholar, 9Monaghan G. Clarke D.J. Povey S. See C.G. Boxer M. Burchell B. Genomics. 1994; 23: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Based upon characterization of the UGT1A locus, the 3′-donor splice site of the first exons at the 5′ end of the locus are spliced to the acceptor splice site of exon 2, thereby combining unique first exons with the constant exons 2–5 at the 3′ end of the locus. The presence of TATA-like elements approximately 30 bp upstream of the exon 1 sequences indicates that individual transcriptional regulation may occur with each UGT1A gene (8Owens I.S. Ritter J.K. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1995; 51: 306-338Google Scholar). Human UGT1A proteins are implicated in the pathophysiology of several disorders. Genetic abnormalities leading to down-regulation or loss of UGT1A function can result in relatively harmless conditions such as Gilbert's or Crigler-Najjar type II disease, but can also constitute a fatal metabolic error present in Crigler-Najjar type I disease (10Chowdhury J.R.

Additionally, UGT1A proteins have been identified as hepatocellular autoantigens in autoimmune hepatitis type 2 and chronic viral hepatitis D (14Philipp T. Durazzo M. Trautwein C. Alex B. Straub P.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2979-2985PubMed Google Scholar). In light of their role in human physiology, hepatic UGT1A proteins have been studied in detail leading to the identification and cloning of UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, and UGT1A9 from liver tissue (6Mojarrabi B. Butler R. Mackenzie P.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Ritter J.K. Crawford J.M. Owens I.S. J. Biol.

However, to understand the complex contribution of the UGT1A locus to human xenobiotic and endobiotic metabolism, their regulation in tissues outside the liver, such as the gastrointestinal tract, is required. Recently, the investigation of UGT1A expression in biliary and gastric epithelium has confirmed an individual expression of UGT1A proteins in a tissue specific fashion. This has led to the identification and cloning of the extrahepatic UGT1A7 and UGT1A10 (16Strassburg C.P. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2979-2985PubMed Google Scholar, 19Strassburg C.P. Oldhafer K. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). UGT1A7 and UGT1A10 belong to the UGT1A7–10 cluster of UGT1A genes that share sequence similarities of approximately 90%. Although UGT1A8 expression has not been identified to date, the expression of UGT1A7 and UGT1A10 in extrahepatic tissues and their absence from hepatic tissue suggests that this subset of UGT1A genes may have evolved to accommodate nonhepatic glucuronidation requirements of the body. To provide evidence for the role of this cluster of highly related UGT1As in the extrahepatic digestive tract, it was necessary to specifically characterize their tissue distribution. In this study, UGT1A gene expression levels and isoform profiles of liver and the three extrahepatic gastrointestinal tissues, biliary, gastric, and colonic epithelium, were compared. Expression of the UGT1A locus in human colon has not been examined previously. The present study analyzed UGT1A mRNA and protein to address the question of whether colon tissue expresses a specific set of UGT1A proteins. The human colon is in prolonged contact with digested matter and is a common route of medical drug application. We have previously examined the expression of the UGT1A locus in liver and biliary epithelium, and expand on this analysis by comparing expression in colonic epithelium. Evidence is provided for a tissue specific gene expression of the UGT1A locus in colon, with the characterization of a novel extrahepatic UGT1A8 protein. Liver tissue samples were obtained from 16 patients undergoing hemihepatectomy or liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma, and biliary epithelium was obtained from four healthy gallbladder specimens as reported previously (19Strassburg C.P. Oldhafer K. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Gastric tissue was obtained from 13 patients undergoing three fourths gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma, and colonic tissue was collected from five surgical specimens removed during hemicolectomy for adenocarcinoma. All surgical specimens were obtained from the University of Hannover Medical Center, Hannover, Germany. Only healthy tissue that did not display signs of necrosis or any pathoanatomical abnormalities was included. All samples were immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and continuously stored at −80 °C until analysis. Approximately 200 mg of frozen tissue were pulverized in a mortar filled with liquid nitrogen. Tissue powder was immediately lysed in acidic phenol/guanidinium isothiocyanate solution (Tripure, Boehringer Mannheim, Germany), and RNA was extracted as reported previously (19Strassburg C.P. Oldhafer K. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Concentrations were measured by optical density at 260 and 280 nm, and RNA samples were stored in water at −80 °C until further use. Three μg of total RNA were denatured for 10 min at 70 °C in the presence of 0.5 μg of oligo(dT) primer and placed on ice. The reaction conditions were adjusted to 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm of each dNTP in a total volume of 19 μl, which was incubated at 42 °C for 5 min. Synthesis was started by adding 200 units of reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Life Sciences, Inc.). The final volume of 20 μl was incubated at 42 °C for 50 min, at 70 °C for 15 min, and placed on ice. RT-PCR was used to exclude contamination of RNA with DNA. Amplification of human β-actin with the primers 5′-ggcggcaccaccatgtaccct-3′ and 5′-aggggccggactcgtcatact-3′ (20Wei Q. Xu X. Cheng L. Legerski R.J. Ali-Osman F. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5025-5029PubMed Google Scholar) spanning the exon 4/intron 5/exon 5 junction of human β-actin leads to a 202-bp product when a cDNA template is present, but results in a 312-bp product when a genomic DNA template is present. Both products can be clearly distinguished by 2% agarose electrophoresis. All cDNAs used displayed a 202-bp product and were thus free of contaminating genomic DNA. The presence of UGT1A transcripts in total tissue RNA was detected by the amplification of a 487-bp fragment from the conserved UGT1A exons 2–5 using DRT-PCR as previously reported in detail (19Strassburg C.P. Oldhafer K. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In brief, amplification with UGT1A primers at concentrations of 2 μm each was first carried out for six cycles using a Perkin-Elmer 480 Thermocycler (all PCR reactions). After the addition of β-actin primers to a concentration of 0.4 μm, cycling was continued for a total of 32 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 59 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR was preceded by a hot start of 3 min at 94 °C and followed by a 7-min elongation at 72 °C. DRT-PCR products were separated in a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Polaroid (Cambridge, MA) type 665 positive/negative film was used to quantify bands by laser densitometry on a LKB 2222–020 UltroScan XL densitometer (LKB, Bromma, Sweden). Arbitrary units were calculated relative to β-actin products. Independent and combined linear kinetics for both products were established as described previously (16Strassburg C.P. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2979-2985PubMed Google Scholar, 19Strassburg C.P. Oldhafer K. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. The UGT1A locus predicts the existence of nine proteins termed UGT1A1 and UGT1A3–1A10. UGT1A2, UGT1A11 and UGT1A12 lack an uninterrupted open reading frame and have therefore been identified to be pseudogenes (8Owens I.S. Ritter J.K. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1995; 51: 306-338Google Scholar). DRT-PCR detection of all nine UGT1A transcripts predicted by the human UGT1Alocus was performed using nine exon 1-specific sense primers and two antisense primers located within exons 2–5 or within a common portion of the 3′ end of the first exons (19Strassburg C.P. Oldhafer K. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Primer sequences can also be obtained at http://www.molpharm.org/cqi/content/full/52/2/212. As already reported elsewhere (19Strassburg C.P. Oldhafer K. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), exon-specific primers were generated which lead to RT-PCR products of distinct molecular sizes: UGT1A1, 644 bp; UGT1A3, 483 bp; UGT1A4, 572 bp; UGT1A5, 659 bp; UGT1A6, 562 bp; UGT1A7, 754 bp; UGT1A8, 514 bp; UGT1A9, 392 bp; and UGT1A10, 478 bp. Coamplification of the UGT1A first exon and β-actin sequences was performed using three cycling protocols, UGT1A1 and UGT1A6, 94 °C (1 min), 59 °C (1 min), 72 °C (1 min); UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A5, 94 °C (1 min), 56 °C (1 min), 72 °C (1 min); and UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, UGT1A10, 94 °C (1 min), 64 °C (1 min), 72 °C (1 min). Each protocol was preceded by a 3-min incubation of the reaction mixture at 94 °C and followed by a 7-min elongation at 72 °C. The specificity and kinetics of this assay have previously been documented in detail (16Strassburg C.P. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2979-2985PubMed Google Scholar, 19Strassburg C.P. Oldhafer K. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in duplicate, and controls without cDNA, primers, or thermophilic polymerase were included. Quantification of products by laser densitometry was performed as described above. Liver, gastric, gall bladder, and colonic tissue samples of approximately 150 mg were pulverized under liquid nitrogen, resuspended in 1 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2) and homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder. The tissue homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. The pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer and centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. The combined supernatants were centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.2 mL of buffer. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar). Microsomal protein was stored at −80 °C. Microsomal protein from human liver, gastric, biliary, and colonic epithelium was boiled for 90 s in loading buffer (2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 62.5 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue) with β-mercaptoethanol and resolved by 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis prior to electrotransfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Also included was a 20-μg sample of total Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cell lysate expressing recombinant UGT1A1 protein (15Strassburg C.P. Obermayer-Straub P. Alex B. Durazzo M. Rizzetto M. Tukey R.H. Manns M.P. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 1576-1586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Immunodetection was performed following published protocols (15Strassburg C.P.

UGT1A protein was detected using a human anti-UGT1A antiserum of a patient with chronic hepatitis D (liver/kidney microsomal autoantibody type 3 (LKM-3)-positive serum) diluted 1:1000. This autoimmune serum has been characterized to specifically recognize UGT1A protein (14Philipp T. Durazzo M. Trautwein C. Alex B. Straub P. Lamb J.G. Johnson E.F. Tukey R.H. Manns M.P. Lancet. 1994; 344: 578-581Abstract PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Visualization was achieved with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG diluted 1:1000. Eight copies of the peptide SSLHKDRPVEPLDLA were synthesized on a branched lysine multiple antigen peptide core (Research Genetics Inc., Huntsville, AL). This 15-mer sequence is located between amino acids 441 and 455 on exon 5 of the constant carboxyl-terminal portion of the UGT1A7 sequence and is common to all UGT1A proteins. Animals were injected subcutaneously into dorsal sites with 0.5 mg of peptide on day 1, 14, 42, and 56, and serum was collected after day 70. Antibody production was monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with 1 μg of peptide used as a solid phase per well. Titers at 70 days exceeded 1:204,800. Western blot analysis of recombinant baculovirus generated UGT1A1, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, and UGT1A10 protein was performed using a 1:1500 dilution of rabbit anti-UGT1A immunoglobulin as first antibody and a goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugated IgG diluted 1:4500 as the visualization antibody. cDNA was synthesized from 3 μg of total colonic RNA as described above. For amplification of the entire UGT1A8 open reading frame, two primers were generated by automated phosphoamidite chemistry (UCSD Cancer Center Oligonucleotide Core Facility). Primer 1,5′-tcgggatccagttctctcatg(start)gctcgcac-3′, was designed to incorporate a BamHI restriction site upstream of the ATG start codon, and primer 2, 5′-cacaagcttctca(stop)atgggtcttggatttgtgg-3′, was designed to introduce a HindIII restriction site downstream of the inherent TGA-stop codon to facilitate directional cloning of the product. In a reaction volume of 100 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 2.75 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.3 mm each dNTP, 1 μm of each primer, and containing 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) cycling was carried out at 94 °C (60 s), 58 °C (60 s), and 72 °C (80 s) for 35 cycles. The protocol was preceded by an incubation of 5 min at 94 °C and followed by an extended elongation time of 7 min at 72 °C. The amplified product of approximately 1600 bp was digested with BamHI and HindIII (New England Biolabs), gel-purified (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany), and inserted into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The sequence of 1593 bp was determined by dideoxy sequencing (Life Sciences, Cleveland, OH) on both strands using internal oligonucleotide primers.

UGT1A7, UGT1A8, and UGT1A10 recombinant virus stock with a titer of 1–2 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml was generated and subsequently used to infect log phase Sf9 cell monolayers at a multiplicity of infection of 10 together with previously reported UGT1A1 recombinant virus as a control (15Strassburg C.P.

Cells were collected at 60 h postinfection and lysed with a Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder in buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2. Recombinant UGT cell lysates were stored at −70 °C until analysis. UGT1A7, UGT1A8, and UGT1A10 were additionally cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and pSVL (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) vectors and expressed in COS-1 cell cultures following published protocols (23Li Q.

Glucuronidation substrates (all 46 tested substrates are listed in Tables I and II) were solubilized in methanol with the exception of 7-hydroxybenzo(a)pyrene, which was resuspended in acetone (7-hydroxybenzo(a)pyrene, and 8-hydroxybenzo(a)pyrene were obtained from the National Cancer Institute Chemical Carcinogen Repository, Midwest Research Institute, Kansas City, MO, all other substrates were from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Catalytic activities of 100 μg of Sf9 cell or COS-1 cell lysate containing recombinant UGT1A7, UGT1A8, or UGT1A10 were assayed in duplicate in the presence of 0.1 mm UDP-glucuronic acid, 0.08 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine, 0.04 μCi of 14C-labeled glucuronic acid, 100 μm test substrate in 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.6, and 10 mm MgCl2 for 60 min at 37 °C. Protein was subsequently precipitated by the addition of ethanol followed by centrifugation. Lyophilized supernatants were resuspended in 50 μl of methanol and separated by thin layer liquid chromatography inn-butanol/acetone/acidic acid/water (35:35:20:20%).14C-Labeled glucuronides were detected by autoradiography.

Open table in a new tab All human UGT1A gene transcripts display a unique 5′ terminus characteristic of each of the individual transferase and a common 3′ portion encoded by exons 2–5. The 3′ region is identical in all members encoded by the UGT1A locus and can therefore be exploited to analyze overall UGT1A expression (Fig. 1). DRT-PCR amplifying a 487-bp fragment of the UGT1A constant region was used to analyze the presence of UGT1A mRNAs and their relative levels in a panel of 16 normal human liver RNAs in comparison to gastric (n = 13), biliary (n = 4), and colonic (n = 5) epithelial tissue. UGT1A expression was detected in all samples studied. Quantification of DRT-PCR products by laser densitometry, however, revealed significant differences of steady state levels between hepatic and extrahepatic tissues. The highest level of UGT1A expression was detected in hepatocellular tissue, which was significantly higher than in biliary (p = 0.001), gastric (p = 0.00001), or colonic (p = 0.0009) epithelium. The comparisons of UGT1A expression between biliary and gastric (p = 0.3), biliary and colonic (p = 0.1), and gastric and colonic tissue (p = 0.6) were not significant. UGT1A expression in endoplasmic reticulum prepared from human hepatocellular, biliary, gastric, and colonic tissue was analyzed by Western blot. Monospecific immunoglobulin capable of detecting the individual UGT1A proteins is not available. However, to analyze total hepatic and extrahepatic UGT1A protein expression, a human LKM-3 anti-UGT1A autoimmune antibody was employed with epitope identity directed specifically against UGT1A proteins (14Philipp T. Durazzo M. Trautwein C. Alex B. Straub P. Lamb J.G. Johnson E.F. Tukey R.H. Manns M.P. Lancet. 1994; 344: 578-581Abstract PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 15Strassburg C.P. Obermayer-Straub P.

Human liver UGT1A expression as detected by anti-UGT1A immunoglobulin Western blot analysis displayed a distinctly different pattern when compared with the other three extrahepatic microsomal preparations (Fig. 2). In hepatic microsomes, several UGT1A subspecies were detected around the typical molecular weight of 55 kDa. In gastric, biliary, and colonic epithelial microsomes, the pattern was more uniform and clearly different from that found in liver. This indicates the presence of different UGT1A proteins expressed in liver and confirms a qualitative and tissue-specific differential expression of the human UGT1A locus. However, defining the specificity of the UGT1A expression with antibodies is difficult since little difference in the resolution of the different proteins was apparent from Western blot analysis. In the absence of specific UGT1A immunoglobulin to detect the individual proteins, experiments were designed to characterize specific UGT1A gene expression at the mRNA level. Analysis of UGT1A gene expression was performed at the mRNA level employing UGT1A exon 1-specific DRT-PCR. As reported previously, human hepatic, gastric, and biliary tissues are characterized by a unique and tissue-specific differential expression of the UGT1A locus, which is demonstrated in Fig. 3, as previously reported (19Strassburg C.P. Oldhafer K. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In contrast to hepatocellular epithelium, both gastric and biliary epithelium express UGT1A10, while gastric epithelium also expresses UGT1A7. Within these three tissues UGT1A9 expression was found exclusively in the liver. In human colon, however, a unique expression pattern was identified, which is ch"

Binding of sCD14 to both sPGN and ReLPS (where ReLPS is LPS from Salmonella minnesota Re 595) was competitively inhibited by unlabeled sCD14, 1–152 N-terminal fragment of sCD14, sPGN, smooth LPS, ReLPS, lipid A, and lipoteichoic acid but not by dextran, dextran sulfate, heparin, ribitol teichoic acid, or soluble low molecular weight PGN fragments. Binding of sCD14 to sPGN was slower than to ReLPS but of higher affinity (KD = 25 nm versus41 nm). LPS-binding protein (LBP) increased the binding of sCD14 to sPGN by adding another lower affinity KD and another higher Bmax, but for ReLPS, LBP increased the affinity of binding by yielding twoKD with significantly higher affinity (7.1 and 27 nm). LBP also enhanced inhibition of sCD14 binding by LPS, ReLPS, and lipid A. Binding of sCD14 to both sPGN and ReLPS was inhibited by anti-CD14 MEM-18 mAb, but other anti-CD14 mAbs showed differential inhibition, suggesting conformational binding sites on CD14 for sPGN and LPS, that are partially identical and partially different.

Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PGN, similar to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria, can reproduce most of the clinical manifestations of bacterial infections, including fever, acute-phase response, inflammation, septic shock, leukocytosis, sleepiness, malaise, abscess formation, and arthritis. Most of these effects are due to the release of cytokines and other mediators from macrophages and other cells (2Heymer B. Seidl P.H. Schleifer K.H. Stewart-Tull D.E.S. Davies M.

To prevent deleterious effects of these bacterial products on the host, it is essential to understand in detail the mechanism of cell activation by PGN and LPS. Since the first step in cell activation is the interaction of the activator with the cell surface receptor, we decided to identify and characterize the receptors for PGN on macrophages. CD14 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked 55-kDa protein present on the surface of macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes that functions as the cell surface receptor for LPS (8Wright S.D.

We have recently shown that CD14 also functions as a receptor for PGN, because PGN-unresponsive CD14-negative cells become responsive to PGN following transfection of these cells with CD14 and expression of CD14 on their cell surface (15Gupta D.

Med. 1995; 182: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) from Gram-positive bacteria. It was, therefore, proposed that CD14 functions as a “pattern recognition receptor” (19Pugin J.

This model, which assumes that CD14 can discriminate between different ligands and can control the specificity of macrophage responses, was recently questioned (24Wright S.D. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 6-8PubMed Google Scholar) based on the inability of CD14 to discriminate between agonistic and antagonistic derivatives of LPS (25Delude R.L. Savedra R. Zhao H. Thieringer R. Yamamoto S. Fenton M.J. Golenbock D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9288-9292Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The second alternative model was proposed (24Wright S.D. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 6-8PubMed Google Scholar), according to which CD14 would function as an albumin-like carrier molecule that binds a large variety of molecules without recognition specificity and that it would then transfer these molecules to another, as yet unidentified recognition/cell-activating molecule in the cell membrane. In a third “combinatorial” model (24Wright S.D. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 6-8PubMed Google Scholar), both CD14 and the putative recognition/cell-activating molecule would contribute to the specificity of the response. In addition, other possible models can be proposed, e.g. bacterial cell wall products other than LPS (such as PGN), could bind to another molecule, which in turn would activate CD14, or CD14 could be a part of a receptor complex, and this complex would bind PGN without physical binding of PGN to CD14. To discriminate between these models and to validate the direct function of CD14 as the receptor for a variety of bacterial products, detailed analysis of binding of these bacterial products to CD14 is needed. Because to date detailed studies of binding to CD14 were only performed with enterobacterial LPS (10Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurefel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelly M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M.

Soluble PGN (sPGN) is a polymeric uncross-linked PGN of approximate average Mr = 125,000, released from Staphylococcus aureus grown in the presence of β-lactam antibiotics (5Rosenthal R.S.

Vancomycin specifically binds to the d-Ala-d-Ala part of PGN, the structure uniquely found in uncross-linked PGN and biosynthetic PGN precursors (this accounts for the specificity of vancomycin inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis). PGN precursors are of low molecular weight and were removed by extensive dialysis. By quantitative chemical analysis, the sPGN was more than 98% pure (5Rosenthal R.S. Dziarski R.

Ribitol teichoic acid was obtained from S. aureus cell walls by trichloroacetic acid extraction as described (5Rosenthal R.S. Dziarski R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 253-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and after hydrolysis contained glucosamine, anhydroribitol, and alanine. Purified LPS, obtained from Escherichia coli O113 by phenol/water extraction (refined endotoxin standard, approximate average Mr = 15,000), and diphosphoryl lipid A from Salmonella typhimurium Re mutant (Mr = 1797) were obtained from Ribi Immunochem Research (Hamilton, MT). LPS from Salmonella minnesota Re 595 (ReLPS, a minimal naturally occurring endotoxic structure of LPS,Mr = 2000–3000), obtained by phenol/chloroform/petroleum ether extraction, was purchased from Sigma, and its purity was analyzed as described before (37Dziarski R.

The alanine:phosphate ratios were 0.1, 0.1, 0.11, and 0.13, respectively. The nucleic acid content was less than 0.2%. LTA from S. pyogenes, purified by phenol extraction and Sepharose 6B chromatography and analyzed as described (39Courtney H.S. Simpson W.A. Beachey E.H. Infect.

Clinical grade dextran from Leuconostoc mesenteroides (mean Mr = 515,000) and dextran sulfate (17% sulfur content, mean Mr = 515,000) were from Sigma. No significant endotoxin contamination of these preparations was detected (≤1 ng of endotoxin/mg), determined by the Limulus assay (37Dziarski R. Gupta D. J. Biol.

The membranes were incubated for 2 h at 22 °C with 1 μg/ml streptavidin-peroxidase polymer (Sigma), and biotin-streptavidin complexes were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recombinant human full-length (residues 1–323) sCD14, containing at the C terminus five amino acids that constitute protein kinase A phosphorylation site followed by an affinity tag of six histidines, was expressed in a baculovirus system, affinity purified on nickel-agarose, and analyzed as described (40Tapping R.I.

The following mAbs were purchased as affinity purified immunoglobulins: MEM-18 (Sanbio-Monosan, Uden, Netherlands), MY-4 (Coulter, Hialeah, FL), LeuM3 (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA), RPA (Zymed, San Francisco, CA), biG 2, biG 3, biG 4, biG 11, biG 14 (Biometec, Greifswald, Germany), and CRIS-6 (Antigenix America, Franklin Square, NY). Affinity purified 3C10 and 60bca were kindly provided by Dr. Theo N. Kirkland, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, University of California, San Diego. 63D3-producing clone was obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD), and 63D3 was purified from murine ascites by protein G affinity chromatography and desalted using ImmunoPure (G) IgG purification kit (44441, Pierce). Affinity purified mouse IgG2b (clone MPC-11, Coulter) and IgG1 (clone 107.3, Pharmingen, San Diego) were used as controls. Human monocytic THP-1 cell line, obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD), was cultured in 1001 Falcon plates (Falcon Plastics, Oxnard, CA) in RPMI 1640 with 10% defined fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT, endotoxin content <0.06 endotoxin units/ml). Before each experiment, cells were allowed to differentiate for 3 days in the presence of 100 nm 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). RAW264.7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum as before (6Gupta D. Jin Y. Dziarski R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2620-2630PubMed Google Scholar). Five μg of sCD14 or soluble dephosphorylated casein from bovine milk as a control (C-4765, Sigma) were labeled with32P by incubating with 0.25 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) and 5 units of catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase from bovine heart (P2645, Sigma) in a total volume of 50 μl for 2 h at 37 °C (40Tapping R.I. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23157-23164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). 100 μg of bovine serum albumin (BSA) was then added, and the reaction mixture was dialyzed twice at 4 °C against total 700 ml of PBS, 3.5-kDa cutoff. The specific activities of32P-labeled sCD14 and casein were 12–36 and 2.7–5.7 μCi/μg, respectively, and their purity was checked by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and autoradiography (see Fig. 5 below). sPGN, MDP, GlcNAc-MDP, pentapeptide, or ReLPS were coupled to agarose (Sepharose CL-4B, Sigma) by mixing 2.7–3.3 mg/ml sPGN or 5 mg/ml MDP, GlcNAc-MDP, pentapeptide, or ReLPS with 50% CNBr-activated (42March S.C. Parikh I. Cuatrecasas P. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 60: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar) agarose in 0.15 m phosphate buffer, pH 8.3, at 4 °C for 5 days, followed by blocking with 1 m ethanolamine and extensive washing with PBS, pH 7.2, with 0.1% NaN3. Coupling efficiency was 1.45–1.5 μg of sPGN/μl of agarose, determined by scintillation counting of sPGN biosynthetically labeled with [14C]Ala. Control agarose was treated in the same way, but the preparations were omitted. Heating the agarose after coupling with 4% SDS at 80 °C for 30 min, followed by extensive washing, did not change the sCD14 binding, indicating that the preparations were covalently coupled to agarose. For the standard binding assay, 2 μl of sPGN-agarose, MDP-agarose, GlcNAc-MDP-agarose, or 1 μl of ReLPS-agarose, or 1 or 2 μl of control agarose were incubated with 2 ng of 32P-labeled sCD14 or casein, with or without 1 μg/ml LBP, in Dulbecco's PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ supplemented with BSA and gelatin (1 mg/ml each) in a total volume of 60 μl, for 60 (sPGN) or 20 min (ReLPS) at 37 °C with frequent mixing. The incubation was ended by adding 190 μl of ice-cold PBS with NaCl (to yield 0.5m final NaCl concentration); the agarose suspension was overlaid onto 0.8 m sucrose in Dulbecco's PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ in two 400-μl polypropylene tubes and centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 × g. The tubes were frozen, and the tips, containing the sedimented agarose with bound radioactivity, were cut off and placed in the scintillation vials for counting. In the saturation binding experiments, the unbound radioactivity (free ligand) in the tube tops was also counted. In some experiments, the amount of agarose, incubation time, or sCD14 concentration were varied, as indicated under “Results.” In the competitive inhibition experiments, inhibitors were first added to sPGN-agarose-, MDP-agarose-, or ReLPS-agarose-containing tubes, followed by the addition of 32P-sCD14, except for inhibition with unlabeled sCD14 or 1–152 sCD14 fragment, which were first mixed with 32P-sCD14, followed by addition of sPGN-agarose or ReLPS-agarose. In mAb inhibition experiments,32P-sCD14 was first incubated with mAbs for 60 min at 37 °C, followed by addition of sPGN-agarose or ReLPS-agarose. The apparent dissociation constant, KD, defined as the concentration of free ligand required to saturate half of the available binding sites, and Bmax (the maximal binding at saturation) were calculated by curve fitting to the hyperbolic function (Bmax × [free sCD14])/(KD + [free sCD14]) using SigmaPlot software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). sPGN, ReLPS, or LPS were labeled with biotin by incubating 2.4 mg/ml sPGN or 5 mg/ml ReLPS (or smooth LPS) with 2.4 or 5 mg/ml, respectively, of sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (21335, Pierce) in 0.1m borate buffer, pH 8.5, at 22 °C for 30 min (according to the manufacturer's protocol), followed by dialysis seven times at 4 °C against total 2100 ml of PBS, 8- (sPGN) or 3.5-kDa (ReLPS and LPS) cutoff. Biotinylated sPGN, ReLPS, and LPS were stored at −80 °C. For the ELISA, 96-well microtiter Immulon-1 plates (Dynatech, Alexandria, VA) were coated with anti-CD14 63D3 mAb (10 μg/ml in 0.05m carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, 0.1 ml/well, for 18 h at 4 °C), blocked with 1% gelatin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed five times with TBS, incubated with 2 μg/ml sCD14 in TBS with 0.1% BSA for 2 h at 22 °C, washed six times with TBS, incubated with 0.02–0.05 μg/ml sPGN-biotin or 0.04–0.2 μg/ml ReLPS-biotin (or smooth LPS-biotin), with or without LBP, in TBS with 0.1% BSA for 4 h at 37 °C, washed six times with TBS, incubated with 400 ng/ml streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase-conjugated polymer (S-5795, Sigma) in TBS with 0.1% BSA for 30 min at 22 °C, washed six times with TBS, and incubated with 1 mg/mlp-nitrophenyl phosphate in 1 m diethanolamine buffer, pH"
https://openalex.org/W1994197049,"Heme oxygenase-1 is an inducible enzyme that catalyzes heme degradation and has been proposed to play a role in protecting cells against oxidative stress-related injury. We investigated the induction of heme oxygenase-1 by the tumor promoter arsenite in a chicken hepatoma cell line, LMH. We identified a heme oxygenase-1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter construct that was highly and reproducibly expressed in response to sodium arsenite treatment. This construct was used to investigate the role of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in arsenite-mediated heme oxygenase-1 gene expression. In LMH cells, sodium arsenite, cadmium, and heat shock, but not heme, induced activity of the MAP kinases extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38. To examine whether these MAP kinases were involved in mediating heme oxygenase-1 gene expression, we utilized constitutively activated and dominant negative components of the ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways. Involvement of an AP-1 site in arsenite induction of heme oxygenase-1 gene expression was studied. We conclude that the MAP kinases ERK and p38 are involved in the induction of heme oxygenase-1, and that at least one AP-1 element (located −1576 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site) is involved in this response."
https://openalex.org/W2021766527,"Alterations in the expression or function of molecules that affect cellular adhesion and proliferation are thought to be critical events for tumor progression. Loss of expression of the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin and increased expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor are two prominent molecular events that are associated with tumorigenesis. The regulation of E-cadherin-dependent cell adhesion by epidermal growth factor (EGF) was therefore examined in the human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-468. In this study, changes were observed in the subcellular distribution of components that mediate the cytoplasmic connection between E-cadherin and the actin-based cytoskeleton in response to activation of the EGF receptor. Serum withdrawal activated E-cadherin-dependent cell-cell aggregation in MDA-MB-468 cells, and this treatment stimulated the interaction of actin, α-actinin, and vinculin with E-cadherin complexes, despite the absence of α-catenin in these cells. By contrast, the co-precipitation of actin with E-cadherin was not detected in several α-catenin positive epithelial cell lines. Treatment with EGF inhibited cellular aggregation but did not affect either the levels of E-cadherin or catenin expression nor the association of catenins (β-catenin, plakoglobin/γ-catenin, or p120cas) with E-cadherin. However, EGF treatment of the MDA-MB-468 cell line dissociated actin, α-actinin, and vinculin from the E-cadherin-catenin complex, and this coincided with a robust phosphorylation of β-catenin, plakoglobin/γ-catenin, and p120cas on tyrosine residues. Furthermore, inactivation of the EGF receptor in serum-treated MDA-MB-468 cells with either a function-blocking antibody or EGF receptor kinase inhibitors mimicked the effects of serum starvation by stimulating both cellular aggregation and assembly of E-cadherin complexes with vinculin and actin. These results demonstrate that the EGF receptor directly regulates cell-cell adhesion through modulation of the interaction of E-cadherin with the actin cytoskeleton and thus substantiates the coordinate role of both of these molecules in tumor progression and metastasis.

Conversely, EGFR expression was shown to be down-regulated in a cervical carcinoma cell line after transfection with E-cadherin (22Wilding J. Vousden K.I. Soutter P.W. Mc Crea P.D. Del Buono R. Pignatelli M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5285-5292PubMed Google Scholar). It appears therefore that increased receptor tyrosine kinase activity and loss of E-cadherin function may be related cellular events that are associated with tumor progression. In addition to the coordinate regulation of EGFR and E-cadherin expression levels, activation of EGFR as well as other tyrosine kinases has been shown to directly affect the adhesive function of E-cadherin via regulatory proteins known as catenins. Three catenins, β-catenin, plakoglobin/γ-catenin, and p120cas, bind to the cytoplasmic domain of cadherins (23Gumbiner B. Neuron. 1993; 11: 551-564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 24Kemler R. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 25Nagafuchi A.

Biol. 1994; 14: 8333-8342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, except for p120cas, associate with the cortical actin cytoskeleton through α-catenin (27Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A. 1995; 92: 8813-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of catenins on tyrosine strongly correlates with modulation of cell adhesion. In particular, tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin was shown to be associated with loss of epithelial differentiation and increased cellular migration which was concomitant with decreased cadherin-dependent adhesion (29Matsuyoshi N.

Cell Res. 1996; 223: 50-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). One study, however, has shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin may not be required for modulation of cell adhesion as chimeric cadherin/α-catenin molecules were sufficient to mediate the shift from strong to weak adhesion in the presence of v-src kinase (37Takeda H. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita J. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). On the other hand, another study has shown that mutations in the region of β-catenin that is tyrosine-phosphorylated byerbB-2 results in suppression of the invasive phenotype (38Shibata T. Ochiai Y. Kanai S. Akimoto S. Gotoh M. Yasui N. Machinami R. Hirohashi S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 883-889PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it remains to be determined whether a direct causality exists between tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin and the loss of an adhesive phenotype. Tyrosine phosphorylation, however, did not change the levels of catenins that were associated with the cadherin cytoplasmic domain, implying that tyrosine phosphorylation may affect the interaction of catenins with adhesion components other than cadherins (26Reynolds A.B. Daniel J. McCrea P.D. Wheelock M.J. Wu J. Zhang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8333-8342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hamaguchi M. Matsuyoshi N. Ohnishi Y. Gotoh M. Takeichi M. Nagai Y.

Commun. 1994; 1: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Several studies have implicated α-catenin as being particularly important in maintaining intercellular adhesion. Aberrant α-catenin expression has been observed frequently in human cancer cell lines with low adhesive activity (39Hirano S. Kimoto N. Shimoyama Y. Hirohashi S. Takeichi M. Cell. 1992; 70: 293-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 40Shimoyama Y. Nagafuchi A. fujita S. Gotoh S. Takeichi M. Tsukita S. Hirohashi S.

Commun. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), and a mutated form of β-catenin lacking the α-catenin binding site has been detected in cancer cell lines (44Oyama T. Kanai Y. Ochiai A. Akimoto S. Oda T. Yanagihara K. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Shibamoto S. Ito F. Takeichi M. Matsuda H. Hirohashi S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6282-6287PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggested that the adhesive activity of cadherins is tightly regulated by α-catenin, possibly due to its role in linking cadherins to the cytoskeleton. In a recent study, the α-catenin-deficient cell line MDA-MB-468 was found under conditions of serum starvation to regain E-cadherin-dependent adhesion (46Hazan R.B. Kang L. Roe S. Borgen P.I. Rimm D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32448-32453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This adhesion was suggested to be mediated by vinculin which is a protein of adheren junctions sharing sequence similarity with α-catenin (47Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Tsukita S. Cell. 1991; 65: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 48Herrenknecht K. Ozawa M. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Lenter M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9156-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). This study implied that vinculin may connect the cadherin cytoplasmic domain to the cortical cytoskeleton in the absence of α-catenin by directly interacting with β-catenin. In the present study, the relationship between tyrosine phosphorylation of the adhesion complex, mediated by EGFR, and the connection of E-cadherin with the actin-based cytoskeleton in the α-catenin-deficient MDA-MB-468 cell line were examined. The absence of α-catenin in this cell line appears to facilitate the isolation of detergent-soluble complexes of cadherins that contain components of the cortical cytoskeleton. Furthermore, the high levels of EGFR expression in this cell line (49Filmus J. Pollack M.N. Cailleau R. Buick R.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 890-898Crossref Scopus (283) Google Scholar) enable study of the modulation of cadherin interactions with components of the actin cytoskeleton by activation of EGFR. Here it is shown that, under serum-free conditions, actin, α-actinin, and vinculin co-precipitated with E-cadherin. The association of actin with E-cadherin was inhibited by cytochalasin D treatment, and this interaction was only detected in MDA-MB-468 cells but not in the MCF-10A, MDA-MB-361, or A431 cell lines, which all express α-catenin. E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell aggregation in MDA-MB-468 cells was dramatically inhibited by EGF treatment, which correlated with prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of catenins (β-catenin, plakoglobin/γ-catenin, and p120cas) and with the dissociation of actin, α-actinin, and vinculin from E-cadherin complexes. Furthermore, inactivation of EGFR in serum-treated MDA-MB-468 cells with a function-blocking antibody or with EGFR kinase inhibitors resulted in induction of E-cadherin-dependent adhesion and in the association of the E-cadherin complex with actin and vinculin. These findings demonstrate an interaction between E-cadherin and the cortical cytoskeleton which is sensitive to the activity of the EGF receptor. Furthermore, these results establish a molecular link between EGFR activity, cadherin-based adhesion, and the actin-cytoskeleton. The breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-361, and BT549, the normal mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A, and the epidermoid A431 carcinoma cell line were all obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere. Epidermal growth factor was purchased from Collaborative Research (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA). Geldanamycin was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD 130305 was a gift from Dr. David Fry (Parke Davis). Cytochalasin D and DMSO were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-human E-cadherin was acquired from Zymed (San Francisco). Monoclonal antibodies to α-, β-, plakoglobin/γ-catenin and p120cas were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Ascites derived anti-vinculin or α-actinin and rabbit polyclonal anti-actin antibodies were purchased from Sigma. The monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (G410) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. mAb 225, recognizing the extracellular domain of the EGFR, was a gift from Dr. John Mendelsohn (MD Anderson Cancer Center), and rabbit antiserum to EGFR was provided by Dr Joseph Schlessinger (New York University). Confluent monolayers were either incubated in medium with 10% FBS (serum-treated) or incubated for 36 h in medium with 0% FBS (serum-starved). Serum-starved monolayers were then treated with or without 200 ng/ml EGF for 10 min at 37 °C prior to cell lysis. For Geldanamycin or PD130305 treatments, confluent monolayers were split at 1:10 dilution, allowed to grow for an additional 48 h to reach about 50–70% confluence, and were treated for 2 or 18 h with various concentrations of inhibitors as indicated. Control monolayers were treated with DMSO alone. Cell monolayers were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and extracted by homogenization in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Phosphatase inhibitors were included in this buffer when cells were harvested for anti-phosphotyrosine detection (50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 3 mm H2O2). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min centrifugation at 4 °C, and supernatants were used immediately for immunoprecipitation. 30 μg of proteins from each indicated extract, as determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), were boiled in SDS sample buffer for 10 min and loaded onto a 7.5% polyacrylamide minigel (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred onto Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), blocked in 3% BSA/phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 2 h at 25 °C with dilutions of 1:1000 of primary antibodies. After washes, membranes were probed with a 1:5000 dilution of secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at 25 °C and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell lysates (5 mg) were incubated with 10 μg of primary antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C and supplemented with 3 mg of Protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h, and the beads were subsequently washed with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in sample buffer for 10 min, processed by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto membranes, and probed with 1:1000 dilutions of indicated antibodies. Blots were further processed as described above. Cell monolayers grown to 98% confluence were incubated for 36 h in medium containing 10% FBS (serum-treated) or 0% FBS serum (serum-starved). Cell monolayers were detached by incubating in HBSS containing 0.02% crystallized trypsin (Worthington) and 10 mm CaCl2 for 5 min at 37 °C. After trypsinization, single cell suspensions were made by trituration with a Pasteur pipette. Cell viability as assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion was greater than 95%. Cells were washed twice in HBSS (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated at 3 × 105 cells per well in 500 μl of HBSS containing 1% BSA and 100 μg/ml DNase (Worthington) with or without 1 mmCaCl2 and in the presence or absence of 100 μg/ml anti E-cadherin or control antibodies as indicated. For EGF treatment, single cell suspensions prepared as described above were incubated with 200 ng/ml EGF in the aggregation wells for the times indicated. A sample of each treatment was further controlled for EGFR levels by Western blotting. For treatment with Geldanamycin (50Schulte T.W. Blagosklonny M.V. Ingui C. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24585-24588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), PD 130305 (51Brigges A.J. Zhou H. Cody D.R. Rewcastle G.W. McMichael A. Hollis-Showalter H.D. Fry D. Kraker A.J. Denny W. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), or mAb 225 (52Fan Z. Masui H. Atlas I. Mendelsohn J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4322-4328PubMed Google Scholar), cells were grown at subconfluent density for 48 h and were incubated with 1 μm Geldanamycin, 1 μm PD 130305, or with 20 mm mAb 225 for 18 h prior to trypsinization. Aggregation assays were performed at 37 °C at 100 rpm for the indicated times in triplicate wells, in 24-well non-tissue culture treated plates (No. 1147; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) that had been blocked with phosphate-buffered saline, 2% BSA for 30 min at 37 °C. Assays were stopped at time 0 and 30 min (unless otherwise indicated) by fixing the cells in 1% glutaraldehyde. The extent of cell-cell binding was monitored by measuring the disappearance of single cells using a Coulter counter. Standard deviations of the mean values are included. In the absence of serum, MDA-MB-468 cells display E-cadherin-dependent aggregation which correlated with a 3-fold increase in E-cadherin protein levels. This increase in E-cadherin was accompanied by the association of vinculin with the E-cadherin·β-catenin complex (46Hazan R.B. Kang L. Roe S. Borgen P.I. Rimm D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32448-32453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This result prompted the examination of additional cytoskeletal proteins that may be recruited to the E-cadherin adhesion complex to support cell-cell adhesion in these cells as a consequence of serum withdrawal. High levels of actin (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) and α-actinin (Fig. 1 A, lane 5), in addition to vinculin (Fig. 1 A, lane 8), were observed to be associated with E-cadherin immunoprecipitates. In contrast, actin, α-actinin, or vinculin were not detected in immunoprecipitates of E-cadherin from serum-treated cells (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1, 4 and 7, respectively). To control for specificity of the antibodies, total cell lysates were reacted with antibodies to each of these proteins (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3, 6, and 9). Background immunoreactivity was consistently observed when E-cadherin immunoprecipitates were probed with the monoclonal antibody to α-actinin (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4 and 5). When 3 times the amount of lysate was used for immunoprecipitation from serum-treated cells to account for the reduced amount of E-cadherin (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 2), similar levels of actin (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and 4), vinculin (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5 and 6), and α-actinin (data not shown) were found in the immune complexes, which suggests that the association of these molecules with E-cadherin in serum-treated MDA-MB-468 cells is restricted by the low levels of E-cadherin expression. The co-precipitation of actin with E-cadherin was completely abolished when serum-starved MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with the actin depolymerizing agent, cytochalasin D, demonstrating that the filamentous form of actin (F-actin) specifically interacts with the E-cadherin complex (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, cytochalasin D did not alter the levels of actin monomers in total cell lysates (Fig. 1 C, lanes 3 and 4). Since extraction of cells with Triton X-100 normally removes F-actin from the soluble fraction, the association of E-cadherin with F-actin observed in Triton X-100 extracts may be due to the presence of soluble F-actin fragments that may have resulted from either differential polymerization or mechanical shearing during cell extraction (53Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 987-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 211-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that E-cadherin interacts with key components of the actin-based cytoskeleton in MDA-MB-468 cells, and these interactions may support cell-cell adhesion in the absence of α-catenin. Actin had not been previously shown to co-precipitate with E-cadherin from detergent-soluble lysates, presumably because this complex is believed to be detergent-insoluble in most cell lines (45Shore E.M. Nelson W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19672-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55McNeill H. Ryan T.A. Smith S.J. Nelson W.J. J.

To explore whether complexes of E-cadherin with actin are detectable in other epithelial cell lines, analysis for the co-precipitation of these molecules was carried out in MCF-10A, MDA-MB-361, and A431 cells, all of which express normal levels of α-catenin and display aggregation properties that are not affected by serum starvation (Ref. 46Hazan R.B. Kang L. Roe S. Borgen P.I. Rimm D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32448-32453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar and data not shown). In contrast to MDA-MB-468 cells, actin was not found in immunoprecipitates of E-cadherin from lysates of the epithelial cancer cell lines MCF-10A, MDA-MB-361, or A431 cells (Fig. 2, lanes 2, 5 and 8, respectively), even though the levels of immunoprecipitated E-cadherin were similar to those found in serum-starved MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 2, lanes 1, 4, 7 and 10, respectively). Actin was present in the detergent-soluble fraction of these cells (Fig. 2, lanes 3, 6 and 9), indicating that the lack of actin in E-cadherin immunoprecipitates from these cells was not due to the insolubility of actin in these lysates. These results show that the absence of detectable actin in E-cadherin immunoprecipitates in these cell lines correlates with their expression of α-catenin. EGF treatment has been shown to promote cell scattering and reduce cell-cell adhesion by an unknown mechanism that correlated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin (34Shibamoto S.

While MVP levels have been found to increase up to 15-fold in non-P-glycoprotein multidrug-resistant cell lines, the levels of vault particles have not been investigated. As both the function of vault particles and the mechanism of drug resistance in non-P-glycoprotein cells are unknown, we decided to determine whether vault synthesis was coupled to MDR. By cloning the human gene for vRNA and careful quantitation of the MVP and vRNA levels in MDR cells, we find that vRNA is in considerable excess to MVP. Sedimentation measurements of vault particles in multidrug resistance cells have indeed revealed up to a 15-fold increase in vault synthesis, coupled with a comparable shift of associated vRNA, demonstrating that vault formation is limited by expression of MVP or the minor vault proteins.

J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar,13Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Vaults purified from rat liver consist of three protein species (210, 192, and 104 kDa) and a small RNA, vRNA. The vRNA constitutes 5% of the rat vault particle by mass and is not a structural component, as ribonuclease digestion does not alter particle morphology (14Kedersha N.L. Heuser J.E. Chugani D.C. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). vRNAs isolated from different species share a similar predicted secondary structure despite their differences in length, indicating that vRNA association with vaults is not fortuitous (15Kickhoefer V.A. Searles R.P. Kedersha N.L. Garber M.E. Johnson D.L. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7868-7873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that it has a fundamental role in the function of the vault particle possibly through RNA-RNA or RNA-protein interactions. The 104-kDa MVP constitutes >70% of the total protein from rat vaults and is the main structural component of the particle. Although the size of the MVP varies slightly among species, it retains immunological cross-reactivity (16Kedersha N.L. Miquel M.C. Bittner D. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Vaults are widely distributed throughout eukaryotes, and their morphology is highly conserved among these species. The structure of the vault particle has been extensively studied by electron microscopy (14Kedersha N.L. Heuser J.E. Chugani D.C. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Its dimensions have been determined to be ∼55 × 30 nm, with a molecular mass of about 13 MDa (three times the size of a ribosome). The intact vault particle has 2-fold symmetry, with each half vault capable of opening into a flower-like structure containing eight petals surrounding a central ring. The remarkable conservation and broad distribution of vaults suggest that their function is essential to eukaryotic organisms and that the structure of the particle must be important for its function. Although vault function is undetermined, a portion of vaults have been localized to the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear membrane at or near nuclear pore complexes (17Chugani D.C. Rome L.H. Kedersha N.L. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 23-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, vault particle mass and symmetry are strikingly similar to the predicted mass of the putative central plug of the nuclear pore complexes, leading us to propose that vaults participate in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. This hypothesis has increased in significance in view of the finding that MVP is up-regulated in non-Pgp MDR cell lines. Here we describe the cloning of the human vRNA genes and show by subcellular fractionation of vault particles that both MVP and vault-associated vRNA levels are similarly increased in various non-Pgp drug-resistant cell lines. These results support the conclusion that vaults are up-regulated in certain drug-resistant cell lines. MDR cell lines, SW1573/2R120 (non-small cell lung cancer) (18Kuiper C.M. Broxterman H.J.

Drug-sensitive SW1573, GLC4/S, MCF-7, and 8226/S cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. To isolate the genes encoding the human vault RNAs we screened a Lambda FIX II (Stratagene) human genomic DNA library that was constructed by Kathy Kampf (UCLA MRRC Molecular Biology Core Facility). A total of 6.25 × 105recombinants were screened as described previously (15Kickhoefer V.A. Searles R.P. Kedersha N.L. Garber M.E. Johnson D.L. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7868-7873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a random primed partial human vRNA gene. Comparisons between the rat and bullfrog vRNA sequences revealed that bases 11–27 and 110–129 (based on the rat vRNA sequence) were conserved (15Kickhoefer V.A. Searles R.P. Kedersha N.L. Garber M.E. Johnson D.L. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7868-7873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primers to these conserved regions were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer and used to amplify partial human vRNA genes by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA. The purified polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene) and sequenced by the dideoxy method using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). These partial human vRNA genes were used as hybridization probes. Two clones were identified and plaque-purified (1 and 4). Based on Southern blot analysis a 350-base SacI fragment was subcloned into pBluescript SK+ (HVG1) and sequenced. Subcloning and sequence analysis revealed that the second clone (no. 4) contained two vRNA genes (HVG2 and HVG3) within about 7 kilobase pairs of each other. The sequences have been submitted to GenBankTM (accession nos. AF045143, AF045144, and AF045145;HVG1 through HVG3, respectively). Extracts were prepared from various drug-sensitive, -resistant, and -revertant cell lines by the following procedure. Cells (108) were harvested, counted, and resuspended in 5 ml of cold buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 75 mm NaCl) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μmleupeptin, 5 μm pepstatin). All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were vortexed, incubated on ice for 5 min, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The postnuclear supernatant fraction was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was designated the S100 fraction. The nuclear and 100,000 × g pellets (P100) were resuspended by Dounce homogenization in buffer A containing 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors in the original volume. Equal volume amounts of fractions were analyzed for protein and RNA content. The GLC4/ADR P100 fraction was then applied to a 20/30/40/45/50/60% sucrose step gradient in buffer A (containing 1/2/2/2/2/1 ml in each layer, respectively) and centrifuged at 28,000 rpm in a Beckman SW-41 rotor for 16 h. Under these conditions, intact vault particles localize to the 40/45% sucrose layers (10Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Gradient fractions for each layer were collected, diluted 4-fold with buffer A, and centrifuged for 3 h at 100,000 × g. Pellets were resuspended in buffer A and analyzed for both protein and RNA content. Protein samples were solubilized in SDS sample loading buffer, fractionated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to Hybond-C (Amersham Corp.) by electroblotting. Western blots were performed using the anti-rat vault polyclonal antibody (N2) following established procedures (10Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Reactive bands were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.). RNA from cellular fractions were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Total RNA was isolated by the guanidinium-phenol method. Subsequently the RNAs were fractionated on 8 murea, 10% polyacrylamide gels, and electroblotted to Zeta GT membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was hybridized with a randomly primed human vRNA gene probe (HVG1, specific activity 1 × 109 cpm/μg). Hybridization was carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Hybridized bands were detected by autoradiography. Quantitation of reactive bands (either protein or RNA) was carried out by scanning with a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer SI using ImageQuant software. Fold changes in Table I were calculated from multiple data sets, except for the GLC4 data set, which matched previously determined values (9Scheffer G.L. Wijngaard P.L.J. Flens M.J.

Western analysis and quantitation was carried out as described above.

Furthermore, revertant cell lines, which were isolated by culturing in the absence of drug, down-regulate the expression of MVP (6Scheper R.J. Broxterman H.J. Scheffer G.L. Kaaijk P. Dalton W.S. van Heijningen T.H. van Kalken C.K. Slovak M.L. de Vries E.G. van der Valk P. Meijer C.J.L.M. Pinedo H.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1475-1479PubMed Google Scholar). However, transfection studies have shown that overexpression of the MVP cDNA alone is not sufficient to confer a drug resistant phenotype (9Scheffer G.L. Wijngaard P.L.J. Flens M.J. Izquierdo M.A. Slovak M.L. Pinedo H.M. Meijer C.J.L.M. Clevers H.C. Scheper R.J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). This is not unexpected as the MVP comprises only 70% of the vault particle mass. Therefore additional components of the vault particle (like the minor vault proteins and vRNA) could also be required for drug resistance. Partial sequence conservation between rat and bullfrog vRNAs allowed us to clone the human vRNA genes. Humans contain three vRNA homologues that share about 84% identity with each other: one is 96 bases in length (human vRNA gene, HVG1) and the other two are 86 bases in length (HVG2 and HVG3; Fig. 1). The human vRNAs can be folded into secondary structures similar to those for rat and bullfrog vRNAs (15Kickhoefer V.A. Searles R.P. Kedersha N.L. Garber M.E. Johnson D.L. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7868-7873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Like other vRNA genes, the human vRNA genes contain internal RNA polymerase III-type promoter elements and end with a typical polymerase III termination signal of four Ts (Fig. 1). We have previously shown, by subcellular fractionation, that vaults pellet at 100,000 × g (P100) and that all of the MVP is associated with this fraction and is assembled into vaults (10Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In contrast, only a portion of the total cellular vRNA fractionates to the P100 where it is associated with vaults. This non-vault-associated vRNA fractionates in the soluble or S100 fraction (Fig. 2 A). Although there are multiple human vRNAs, we have determined that only one form (HVG1) associates with the vault particle (as evidenced by pelleting at 100,000 × g, Fig. 2 A). Surprisingly, the 86-bp encoded vRNAs are not present in all of the cell lines (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–3, 9, and 10). However, PCR analysis of genomic DNA from these lines indicates the genes are present (data not shown). These data indicate that, while the 86-bp RNAs (HVG2 and HVG3) are vRNA-related, they are apparently not vault-associated RNAs.Figure 2A, drug-resistant myeloma cells were separated into nuclear (N), high speed supernatant (S), and high speed pellet (P) fractions. RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blotting. B, total RNA (10 μg) from the indicated cell lines (lanes 1–10) were examined by Northern analysis.

Broxterman H.J. Scheffer G.L. Kaaijk P. Dalton W.S. van Heijningen T.H. van Kalken C.K. Slovak M.L. de Vries E.G. van der Valk P. Meijer C.J.L.M. Pinedo H.M.

Med. 1995; 1: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Here we measured vault particle levels by sedimentation analysis in conjunction with an analysis of the levels of MVP and associated HVG1 vRNA in the small cell lung cancer line GLC4/S (parental), and its derivative cell lines the drug resistant GLC4/ADR and drug revertant GLC4/REV (Fig. 3, Table I). A comparison of the resistant and parental MVP revealed a 15-fold increase in MVP protein levels and suggested that the increased protein was assembled into a macromolecular form able to pellet at 100,000 × g(Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 6). This 15-fold increase in MVP protein levels is in agreement with the increased expression of MVP mRNA (9Scheffer G.L. Wijngaard P.L.J. Flens M.J. Izquierdo M.A. Slovak M.L. Pinedo H.M. Meijer C.J.L.M. Clevers H.C. Scheper R.J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). In addition, Northern analysis of the same fractions extracted for RNA revealed that vault-associated HVG1 vRNA increased about 15-fold (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3 and 6). A concomitant shift of the vRNA from the S100 to the P100 fraction in the drug resistant line (Fig. 3 B,lanes 5 and 6) suggests that a larger fraction of vRNA is associated with vaults. Likewise in the revertant line, which was isolated by culturing in the absence of drug, but is still a drug-resistant cell line (albeit at a lower concentration of drug), protein and vRNA levels decrease (Fig. 3 A, lanes 6 and 9; Fig. 3 B, lanes 6 and 9). Both the MVP and vRNA levels decrease to comparable levels in the revertant line (Table I). Analysis of total RNA indicates that vRNA levels remain constant in the different lines, and that increased association with vaults is not due to an increase in transcription of the vRNA gene (Fig. 3 C). This is not surprising since we have determined that on average only about 20% of the total vRNA is associated with the vault particle in these MDR cancer cell lines (data not shown). These results support the hypothesis that there is a dynamic relationship between the vRNA and vaults and that there is a pool of vRNA from which a certain fraction is associated with the vault particle at any particular time. Thus an increase in the general pool of vaults (as in the drug resistant lines) results in an increase in the fraction of the vRNA pool that is vault associated (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5 and 6). Correspondingly, in the revertant lines, a shift of vRNA from the P100 back to the S100 pool is observed (Fig. 3 B, lanes 8 and 9), supporting our view that the vRNA is a dynamic component of the vault particle. Recent studies in our laboratory have demonstrated by UV cross-linking that the vRNA interacts primarily with the minor vault proteins and not the MVP. 2V. A. Kickhoefer and L. H. Rome, manuscript in preparation. Further fractionation of the GLC4/ADR P100 fraction on a sucrose equilibrium gradient revealed that the majority of MVP and vRNA were present in the 45% layer, coincident with the previously published behavior of purified vault particles (Fig. 4). This data verifies that the increases of MVP and vRNA seen in the P100 fraction accurately reflect the level of assembled vault particles. From these data we conclude that the co-ordinate changes in MVP and vRNA levels in the P100 fraction indicate that vault particle levels vary depending on the level of drug susceptibility in the cell lines. We extended this analysis to four additional MDR lines including the parental and when available to revertant line(s). The results are summarized in Table I which shows the fold change in the relative levels of P100 MVP and vRNA compared with their parental cell lines. This data supports the conclusion that vault particle levels are also up-regulated in these MDR cell lines. Analysis of Table I revealed that as little as 1.3-fold up-regulation was sufficient to confer the drug resistant phenotype in one cell line compared with a high of 15-fold seen in another. We reasoned that this variability might be explained by a difference in the number of vault particles present in the parental cell lines, perhaps a higher induction would be necessary if the parent cell started with a lower level of endogenous vaults. Vault particle levels were determined by analysis of protein levels in the P100 fraction compared with increasing amounts of purified vaults (Fig. 5). As summarized in TableII, vault levels per cell vary considerably among the different cell lines examined and, consistent with our hypothesis, lines with lower levels of endogenous vault particles (GLC4/S and MCF7/S) showed the highest fold induction seen in Table I. Among the lines described in Table II, two (GLC4 and SW1573) were selected with doxorubicin (18Kuiper C.M. Broxterman H.J. Baas F. Schuurhuis G.J. Haisma H.J. Scheffer G.L. Lankelma J. Pinedo H.M. J.

The very high number of vaults in the GLC4 drug resistant line (245,000 vaults per cell) might reflect the high concentration of doxorubicin to which this line is resistant (1 μm), this level of doxorubicin is ten times greater that the level used to select the SW1573 resistant lines 0.1 μm (6Scheper R.J. Broxterman H.J. Scheffer G.L. Kaaijk P. Dalton W.S. van Heijningen T.H. van Kalken C.K. Slovak M.L. de Vries E.G. van der Valk P. Meijer C.J.L.M. Pinedo H.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1475-1479PubMed Google Scholar) which display only one third the number of vaults per cell. The GLC4 revertant has a reduction in vault number that is still over 4-fold higher than the parent line. However, this line, although now sensitive to killing by 1 μm doxorubicin, is still resistant to 0.1 μm doxorubicin and therefore is more similar to the SW1573 resistant line with regard to drug sensitivity than to the SW 1573 revertant. Interestingly the vault levels in these lines (71,000 versus 85,000) are also quite similar. This suggests that absolute vault levels may directly dictate the extent of drug resistance. Another factor which may influence the level of vault induction may be related to the tissue specific distribution of vaults and the cancer type. Thus cells with higher endogenous vault levels, might be primed to become drug resistant and can do so with a relatively modest induction of vault levels. This finding is consistent with the distribution of vaults in tissues with the highest level of exposure to xenobiotics where greater levels of endogenous vaults could predispose these tissues to drug resistance (23Izquierdo M.A. Scheffer G.L. Flens M.J. Giaccone G. Broxterman H.J. Meijer C.J. van der Valk P. Scheper R.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 877-887PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the lowest level of vaults was found in the MCF7/S cell line (10,633 vaults/cell). This line was derived from a breast carcinoma, and its drug-resistant derivative MCF7/MR (39,000 vaults/cell), has a level of vaults comparable to the drug sensitive SW1573/S and 8226/S cell lines and might reflect a different required level of vaults to achieve drug resistance in this tissue type. The mechanism of vault up-regulation is unknown. Although the overexpression of vaults in MDR cells is intriguing, this does not prove that vaults are responsible for drug resistance. We hypothesize that vault overexpression is a critical component of a pathway involved in non-Pgp MDR and that the mechanism of vault-mediated MDR may be through vault binding directly to drugs or possibly through vault interaction with a protein or RNA that binds drugs.

The switch in saponification sensitivity occurred at least 2 h earlier in the mlo-incompatible than in theMlo-compatible interaction.

Structural analysis identified this compound as a novel phenolic conjugate, p-coumaroyl-hydroxyagmatine (p-CHA).p-CHA but not the nonhydroxylated derivativep-coumaroylagmatine exhibited antifungal activity bothin vitro and in vivo. The accumulation ofp-CHA in epidermal tissue correlated tightly with fungal penetration attempts of attacked host cells. Furthermore, upon penetration, epidermal cell wall-bound phenolics became resistant to saponification at sites of attempted fungal ingress (papilla), indicating a change in, or the addition of, different chemical bonding types. The switch in saponification sensitivity occurred at least 2 h earlier in the mlo-incompatible than in theMlo-compatible interaction. Our results suggest thatp-CHA and the speed of papillae compaction play important roles in non-race-specific powdery mildew defense. Low molecular weight compounds have disparate functions in plant-microbe interactions. They can act as signal compounds to initiate a mutually beneficial interaction between plant and microbe. For example, the plant flavonoid luteolin attracts the bacteriumRhizobium meliloti to root hairs and triggers a cascade of events leading to root nodule formation, which provides plants with an efficient nitrogen uptake system (1Caetano-Anolles G. Crist-Estes D.K. Bauer W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3164-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Low molecular weight compounds can also act as part of a defense repertoire in resistance reactions against phytopathogenic microorganisms. The avenacins are effective in oat againstGaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, and the structurally related α-tomatine of tomato inhibits Fusarium solani (reviewed in Ref. 2Osbourn A. Trends Plant Sci. 1996; 1: 4-9Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Plant secondary metabolites for which complementary biochemical and genetic data are consistent with their function in pathogen defense are the stilbene-type resveratol inNicotiana tabacum and the cyclic hydroxamic acid 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one in Zea mays (3Hain R. Reif H.-J. Krause E. Langebartels R. Kindl H. Vornam B. Wiese W. Schmelzer E. Schreier P.H. Stöcker R.H. Stenzel K. Nature. 1993; 361: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar,4Frey M. Chomet P. Glawischnig E. Stettner C. Gruen S. Winkelmair A. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Meeley R.B. Briggs S.P. Simcox K. Gierl A. Science. 1997; 277: 696-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Although the response of barley to attack from powdery mildew has been investigated at cellular, biochemical, and genetic levels, no documented example of a host secondary metabolite has been reported to determine the outcome of the interaction. Powdery mildew,Erysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei, exclusively attacks the barley leaf epidermal cell layer. The fungus invades the plant cell mechanically and enzymatically through the cell wall with a penetration peg. This structure emerges from the appressorium, the thickened tip of the appressorial germ tube. Successful penetration is accomplished by subsequent development of the fungal feeding organ, the haustorium (5Kunoh H. Asada Y. Plant Infection: The Physiological and Biochemical Basis. Japan Scientific Society Press, 1982: 45-59Google Scholar). At least two genetically distinct pathways determine resistance in barley to powdery mildew (6Peterhänsel C. Freialdenhoven A. Kurth J. Kolsch R. Schulze-Lefert P. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1397-1409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first one is dependent on the presence of dominantly acting resistance genes and confers incompatibility only to those fungal isolates carrying corresponding avirulence genes. In most cases, this race-specific resistance is associated with a host cell death reaction at attempted infection sites (hypersensitive reaction; HR). 1The abbreviations used are: HR, hypersensitive reaction; p-CHA, p-coumaroyl-hydroxyagmatine; CWA, cell wall apposition; p-CA,p-coumaroylagmatine; cv, cultivar; BC, back-cross; LC, liquid chromatography; ESI, electrospray ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. The second pathway confers broad spectrum resistance to all tested isolates of the fungus and is stimulated by the absence of the Mlo wild type gene, a putative negative regulator of pathogen defense (7Büschges R. Hollrichter K. Panstruga R. Simons G. Wolter M. Frijters A. van Daelen R. van der Lee T. Diergarde P. Groenendijk J. Toepsch S. Vos P. Salamini F. Schulze-Lefert P. Cell. 1997; 88: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). The function of this pathway is also dependent on at least two further genes,Ror1 and Ror2 (8Freialdenhoven A. Peterhänsel C. Kurth J. Kreuzaler F. Schulze-Lefert P. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Incompatibility mediated by recessive mlo resistance alleles is generally not associated with the occurrence of HR. The only visible cellular response is the formation of a subcellular cell wall apposition (CWA), termed papilla, directly subtending the fungal appressorium (9Aist J.R. Bailey J.A. Deverall B.J. The Dynamics of Host Defence. Academic Press, 1983: 33-70Google Scholar). Fungal penetration attempts are almost invariably arrested in CWAs inmlo-controlled resistance. The potential role of pathogen-induced CWAs in resistance has been of considerable interest. In papillae, induced in different grass species (Gramineae), callose, cellulose, lignin, polyphenolics, reactive oxygen species, peroxidases, and silica were identified (10Ride J.P. Pearce R.B. Physiol. Plant Pathol. 1979; 15: 79-92Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11Russo V.M. Bushnell W.R. Can. J. Bot. 1989; 67: 2912-2921Crossref Google Scholar, 12Scott-Craig J.S. Kerby K.B. Stein B.D.

Carver T.L.W. Can. J. Bot. 1993; 71: 284-296Crossref Google Scholar). In the barley-mildew interaction, two of these substances have been reported to contribute to fungal arrest in CWAs: callose deposition (16Bayles C.J. Ghemawat M.S. Aist J.R. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1990; 36: 63-72Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Lynkjaer M.F. Carver T.L. Zeyen R.J. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1997; 50: 17-36Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and cell wall-bound phenolics (17Lynkjaer M.F. Carver T.L. Zeyen R.J. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1997; 50: 17-36Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Zeyen R.J. Bushnell W.R. Carver T.L.W. Robbins M.P. Clark T.A. Boyles D.A. Vance C.P. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1995; 47: 119-140Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Biological functions of phenolics range from cell wall reinforcement, antimicrobial activity, plant hormones, or defense signaling compounds to scavengers of reactive oxygen species (19Nicholson R.L. Hammerschmidt R. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1992; 30: 369-389Crossref Scopus (1078) Google Scholar, 20Ryals J.A. Neuenschwander U.H. Willits M.G. Molina A. Steiner H.-Y. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1809-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar). Phenolics can be conjugated to various substances, for example carbohydrates, proteins, or polyamines. Polyamines have themselves been implicated in resistance responses as well as regulation of DNA replication, gene transcription, organ development, leaf senescence, and tuber dormancy (21Evans P.T. Malmberg R.L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 40: 235-269Crossref Google Scholar, 22Kumar A. Altabella T. Tayler M.A. Tiburcio A.F. Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 124-130Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In barley, well examined phenolic polyamine conjugates are thep-coumaroylagmatine (p-CA) derivatives. Dimers ofp-CA, the hordatines, are implicated in defense responses and have been proposed as antifungal factors (23Stoessl A. Unwin C.H. Can. J. Bot. 1970; 48: 465-470Crossref Google Scholar). Their formation appears to be restricted to the genus Hordeum. The synthesis of these phenolic polyamine conjugates combines the phenylpropanoid and polyamine pathway (Scheme 1). Phenolics in CWAs have been characterized mainly by histochemical analyses (10Ride J.P. Pearce R.B. Physiol. Plant Pathol. 1979; 15: 79-92Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These could not address the individual components of this compound class. In this study, we developed a detection system to monitor soluble and cell wall-bound phenolics in the target tissue of the pathogen. We used a combined genetical and biochemical approach to show their differential accumulation in compatible and incompatible interactions of the mlo-mediated powdery mildew resistance in barley. The susceptible Mlo barley genotypes used were cultivar (cv) Ingrid and cv Pallas. Themlo-resistant plants used were the back-cross lines (BC) BC Ingrid mlo-3, BC Ingrid mlo-5, and BC Pallasmlo-5 (24Hinze K. Thompson R.D. Ritter E. Salamini F. Schulze-Lefert P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3691-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 25Kølster P. Munk L. Soglen O. Løhde J. Crop Sci. 1986; 25: 903-907Crossref Google Scholar). The examined ror1 mutants A89 (ror1–2) and C69 (ror1–4) and theror2 mutant A44 have been described by Freialdenhovenet al. (8Freialdenhoven A. Peterhänsel C. Kurth J. Kreuzaler F. Schulze-Lefert P. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). 50 seeds of each cultivar were sown per pot in a peat-clay mixture and grown in a glasshouse at 15 °C, 75% humidity, and a photoperiod of 16 h with a light intensity of 100 microeinsteins. Powdery mildew inoculations were performed with the E. graminis hordei isolate K1 (24Hinze K. Thompson R.D. Ritter E. Salamini F. Schulze-Lefert P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3691-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), propagated on the barley cv Golden Promise Mlo. Six days after sowing, both adaxial and abaxial surfaces of the primary leaves were inoculated in a spore settling tower (26Wolfe M.S. Schwarzenbach E. Phytopathol. Z. 1975; 82: 297-307Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), resulting in a density of approximately one spore/epidermal host cell. Fungal germlings were removed from leaf surfaces with a wet cotton ball. The efficiency of this procedure was checked both microscopically and macroscopically by testing the absence of colony growth on susceptible Mlocultivars 7 days after inoculation. Abaxial epidermal peels were ground in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized. Samples of 2–5 mg were extracted four times with 500 μl of 70% methanol (aqueous). The phenolics in the combined methanolic phase were separated and quantified by reverse phase HPLC using a Prodigy 5 ODS-2 column (Phenomenex; 5 μm, 250 × 460 mm) with gradient elution employing increasing methanol-acetonitrile (1:1 (v/v)) levels (solvent A) in 10 mm ammonium formate buffer, pH 3 (solvent B). The following gradient elution conditions were used: time = 0 min/10% A; time = 20 min/18% A; time = 50 min/50% A; time = 55 min/95% A; time = 60 min/10% A; flow rate = 1 ml/min; injection loop = 100 μl. For separating p-coumaroyl-hydroxyagmatine and its oxidative product, a Hypersil 5μ BDS C8 column (Hypersil; 5 μm, 250 × 460 mm) was used with a gradient of solvent A in 10 mm ammonium formate buffer, pH 8 (solvent C). The following gradient elution conditions were used: time = 0 min/7% A; time = 40 min/15% A; time = 45 min/95% A; time = 50 min/7% A; flow rate = 1 ml/min; injection loop = 100 μl. A dual wavelength detector was used for monitoring the phenolic profiles at 306 and 280 nm, and the peak area was quantified at 306 nm. Unless otherwise stated, all solvents were of HPLC grade purity. Absorbance spectra were performed with a diode array detector by scanning from 230 to 360 nm. The residue of the methanolic extraction of epidermal peels was saponified in 2 ml of 1n NaOH at 70 °C for 24 h, before neutralizing with 9 n HCl to pH 6 and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC using a Prodigy 5 ODS-2 column under the conditions described above. For saponification of whole leaf tissue, squares of 1 cm were floated in 10 ml of 1 n NaOH at 70 °C for 24 h before washing with distilled water until the wash solution reached a pH of 6. The molecular weight (Mr) and the structures ofp-coumaroylagmatine, p-coumaroyl-hydroxyagmatine, and its oxidative product p-coumaroyl-hydroxydehydroagmatine were determined by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) (27Schmidt J. Kramell R. Schneider G. Eur. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 1: 573-581Crossref Google Scholar). The HPLC conditions used were as follows: column, Nucleosil 100–10 C18 (Varioprep; 10 μm, 250 × 40 mm); solvent, acetonitrile/H2O (containing 0.2% acetic acid) 40/60; flow rate = 0.2 ml/min; injection volume = 1 μl; injected amount, approximately 100 ng. The ESI-MS/MS was performed on a Finnigan TSQ 7000 (Bremen, Germany). Conditions for the ESI-MS/MS were as follows: collision energy = −20 eV; collision gas, argon; collision pressure = 1.7 × 10−3 torr (27Schmidt J. Kramell R. Schneider G. Eur. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 1: 573-581Crossref Google Scholar). The collision-induced dissociation was performed on the [M + H]+ ions formed by ESI. Data were acquired in the m/z range from 50 to 300. Electrospray mass spectrometry was used for determining theMr of the hordatines. Data were obtained on a Micromass Platform (Manchester, UK). The following conditions were applied: carrier solvent, acetonitrile/water (1:1 (v/v)); flow injection = 20 μl in 10 μl/min; injected amount = 100 μg; scan rates = 3–10 s/scan over the calibrated mass range (23–1800 Da); ESI probe voltage = 3.2–3.5 kV; cone voltage = 30 V; source temperature = 70 °C. To quantify the frequency of haustoria formation, barley primary leaves were harvested at the indicated time points and fixed in alcoholic lactophenol (ethanol-lactophenol (2:1 (v/v)). Leaves were cleared by boiling for 5 min before staining for 5 s in Coomassie Blue (0, 6% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R 250 (Sigma) in methanol) and rinsed in distilled water. Fungal structures were observed by bright field microscopy (Axiophot, Zeiss, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochem, Germany). The presence of fluorescent phenolics in cell wall appositions was examined by incident light fluorescence microscopy (Axiophot, HBO 50-watt mercury lamp), using a 365-nm exciter filter, 395-nm dichroic mirror, and >397-nm barrier filter. 24 h after fungal inoculation, abaxial epidermal tissue of the cultivar BC Ingrid mlo-3 was harvested, ground, lyophilized, and treated for 7 h in a cellulase solution (150 units/ml; Merck; 0.44 m sorbitol, 9 mmCaCl2, 584 mg/liter MES). Inhibition of spore germination of Puccinia graminis f. sp. triticiwas determined by the slide germination method (23Stoessl A. Unwin C.H. Can. J. Bot. 1970; 48: 465-470Crossref Google Scholar) with an aqueous spore suspension in 2 mm fraction A. The experiment was repeated twice. Antifungal activity of the p-coumaroylagmatine derivatives against E. graminis hordei was monitored on cellulose dialysis membranes (Cuprophan, Medicell International Ltd., London, UK) as described by Francis et al. (28Francis S.A. Dewey F.M. Gurr S.J. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1996; 49: 201-211Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the fungus showed ∼50% germination and ∼20% appressoria formation frequency. The membrane was first boiled in distilled water, cut into 1-cm squares, and placed on 2% (w/v) water agar to ensure even hydration (28Francis S.A. Dewey F.M. Gurr S.J. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1996; 49: 201-211Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). 5 μl of the test solutions were applied on the membrane squares with the underlying agar blocks and were allowed to evaporate prior to inoculation. To exclude inhibitory activity of putative impurities in the volatile HPLC solvents, we used lyophilized and water-resolved chromatography buffer resembling the fractionation conditions of the purified p-CHA as a negative control (12% acetonitrile/methanol (1:1 (v/v)), 88% 10 mm ammonium formate buffer, pH 3). Benzimidazol (Sigma), dissolved in distilled water (8 mm), was used as positive control. The membranes were inoculated using a spore settling tower and incubated in the dark at 15 °C and 75% relative humidity. After 24 h, fungal development was scored for germination and appressoria formation frequency under a microscope. 6-day-old seedlings of cv Ingrid Mlo were inoculated with E. graminis at a density of approximately one fungal spore/epidermal host cell. After 10 h, leaves were infiltrated with 50 μl of the aqueous test solutions through adaxial stomata using a blunt-ended syringe (29Collinge D.B. Milligan D.E. Dow J.M. Scofield G. Daniels M.J. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1987; 8: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This incubation scheme was chosen, since previous studies showed movement of low molecular weight substances within 2 h through the host cell wall into the cytoplasm (30Smart M.G. Aist J.R. Israel H.W. Can. J. Bot. 1987; 65: 745-749Crossref Google Scholar). Because in our experimental conditions, accumulation of fraction A started 12 h after fungal spore inoculation, the injected test solutions were expected to mimic the observed timing of p-CHA accumulation. The area covering the injected test solutions was marked with a solvent-free correction fluid. Fungal germlings in this area were microscopically scored on adaxial epidermal surfaces for haustoria formation rates 32 h after inoculation. The susceptible barley cv Ingrid Mlo and its near isogenic resistant BC line BC Ingrid mlo-5 were inoculated with E. graminis spores, and after 22 h epidermal peals of the primary leaves were harvested. The soluble phenolics of the two genotypes were resolved by HPLC (Fig. 1). Only peak 1 showed a significantly different accumulation in the comparison of the susceptible and resistant barley lines. This peak was named fraction A, and time course analyses were performed for its accumulation in both lines (Fig. 2 A). In the resistant line, there was an approximately 25-fold increase in fraction A accumulation from the level of the noninoculated control plants with a maximum at 22 h after inoculation. The accumulation maximum in the susceptible line was about 2-fold lower and delayed by 2 h. To show that the differential accumulation patterns in the incompatible interaction were not dependent on a specific mlo allele, an additional resistant cv BC Ingrid mlo-3 was analyzed. No major differences were detectable in the accumulation profile of the plants carrying the different mlo resistance alleles (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2Time course analysis of fraction A upon powdery mildew challenge. A, accumulation of fraction A in the resistant lines BC Ingrid mlo-3 (⋄), BC Ingridmlo-5 (□), and the susceptible cultivar IngridMlo (▴) between 16 and 40 h after spore inoculation. The data points represent the mean and minimum/maximum absorbance units of two independently extracted samples, each derived from abaxial first leaf epidermal layers of 15 pooled seedlings. The results of noninoculated control plants (×) of all genotypes were almost identical. The mean over the three genotypes is represented. Fungal penetration frequency was scored as rate of haustorium formation. Each data point represents the mean and minimum/maximum values of two leaves, each representing 100 inspected plant/fungus interaction sites. Similar profiles were obtained in two independent experiments.B, accumulation of fraction A in the resistant line BC Ingrid mlo-5 (□) and the mutants ror1–2 (⋄) and ror2 (○). Experimental design was as described forpanel A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In parallel to the characterization of the phenolic profiles, a quantitative cytological analysis of plant-fungus interaction sites was performed at each time point (Fig. 2 A, bottom). The maximum penetration frequency of the fungus in the resistant cv BC Ingrid mlo-5 was less than 0.1%, and in the susceptible cv Ingrid Mlo it was about 60%, similar to previous reports (8Freialdenhoven A. Peterhänsel C. Kurth J. Kreuzaler F. Schulze-Lefert P. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These data revealed a strong correlation between fraction A accumulation and the onset of host cell penetration in the susceptible interaction. We investigated whether the differential accumulation of fraction A was not only independent of different mloresistance alleles but also of the genetic backgrounds. Both tested resistant lines, BC Ingrid and BC Pallas, carrying the mlo-5allele, showed similar accumulation profiles with about a 30-fold increase in comparison with control plants. In the susceptible cv Pallas Mlo, the maximum accumulation is 2–3-fold lower and 2 h later than in the resistant line (data not shown). To further investigate where and when fraction A might play an important role in the mildew resistance, we analyzed genotypes carrying mutations in the mlo-resistant pathway,Ror1 and Ror2 (Fig. 2 B; Ref. 8Freialdenhoven A. Peterhänsel C. Kurth J. Kreuzaler F. Schulze-Lefert P. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The mutants showed a fungal penetration frequency of about 20% for theror1 mutants and about 10% for the ror2 mutant; each exhibits partial susceptibility (8Freialdenhoven A. Peterhänsel C. Kurth J. Kreuzaler F. Schulze-Lefert P. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Fraction A was measured over time in the ror1–2 mutant (A89) and the ror2mutant (A44) in comparison with the resistant line. No significant difference could be observed between the ror1 mutant and the resistant genotype. This finding was supported by similar results of an additional ror1 mutant ror1–4 (C69) (data not shown). However, the accumulation profile of fraction A in theror2 mutant (A44) could be clearly discriminated from the resistant line, with its reduced and delayed accumulation maximum, similar to the susceptible cv Ingrid Mlo (Fig. 2, compareA and B). Since A44 was not back-crossed after mutagenesis of the parent line BC Ingrid mlo-5, the altered concentration of fraction A could also be due to second mutations in genes unrelated to the resistance response. Susceptible F3 plants homozygous for the ror2 mutation revealed results comparable with those obtained with the original A44 mutant (data not shown). Since fraction A was the only detectable phenolic to show different accumulation in response to pathogen attack in the tested compatible and incompatible interactions, we purified the substance to determine its structure. In addition to peak 1 (fraction A), four other peaks of the soluble phenolic profile (peaks 2–5 in Fig. 1) were characterized to obtain a more complete picture of the soluble phenolics in barley epidermal cells. Absorbance spectra of the five peaks indicated that peaks 1–4 (λmax = 291, 298, 321, and 300 nm) belonged to the same family of compounds, the phenolic acid-polyamine conjugates (Fig. 3). The identity of peak 2 was revealed by LC/ESI-MS/MS to bep-CA (Fig. 4). This was indicated by a [M + H]+ peak at m/z 277 and fragment ions at m/z 217, 147, and 131, as well as by comparison of authentic material (Fig. 4A). Peaks 3 and 4 were identified by ESI-MS as hordatine B and A, respectively (data not shown). The [M + H]+ peaks of m/z 581 and 551 and the [M + 2H]2+ peaks of m/z 291 and 276 indicate that hordatine A is a dimer of two molecules ofp-CA and that hordatine B is a dimer of p-CA and feruloylagmatine. Both substances, p-CA and the hordatines have been previously characterized in young barley plants (31Stoessl A. Can. J. Chem. 1967; 45: 1745-1760Crossref Google Scholar). The LC/ESI-MS/MS analysis of fraction A (peak 1) showed a [M + H]+ value of m/z 293 and fragment ions atm/z 275, 233, 147, 130, and 129 (Fig. 4B), indicating a p-coumaroylagmatine with an additional hydroxy function, a p-coumaroyl-hydroxyagmatine (p-CHA). The ion fragments at m/z 233 and m/z 129 suggest that the hydroxy function is positioned in the agmatine moiety (Fig. 4C). MS analyses of a synthetic N-hydroxyarginine showed no loss of 18 mass units representing the loss of a water molecule (data not shown). Since a loss of 18 mass units is observed with p-CHA (fragment ion m/z 275), this provided strong evidence that the hydroxy group is located at the carbon skeleton of the agmatine residue and not at the guanidino function. The higher electronegativity of the guanidino group suggested γ-(3)-C or δ-(4)-C for the position of the hydroxy function on the agmatine fragment. This assumption is also supported by data on δ-(4)-hydroxyarginine (32Papov V.V. Diamonds T.V. Biemann K. Waite J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20183-20192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), γ-(3)-hydroxyarginine (33Makisumi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1961; 49: 284-291Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 34Bell E.A. Nature. 1963; 199: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 35Bell E.A. Tirimanna A.S.L. Nature. 1963; 197: 901-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and γ-(3)-hydroxyagmatine (36Hamana K. Matsuzaki S. Can. J. Bot. 1993; 71: 1381-1385Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Until now, only γ-(3)-hydroxylated arginine derivatives were found in the plant kingdom. However, any direct evidence for the position of the hydroxy group on the agmatine residue of the p-coumaroylagmatine cannot be derived from the MS data. The MS analysis also revealed that peak 1 overlapped with a minor component, showing a [M + H]+ value of m/z291. The two substances could be separated on the HPLC and were named compound A1 (molecular mass of 292 Da,p-coumaroyl-hydroxyagmatine) and A2 (molecular mass of 290 Da). Both compounds A1 and A2 had identical absorbance spectra (Fig. 3,panel 1) and were found in a stable ratio of 7:3 (A1/A2) in the time course analysis. During the purification step of the two substances, the ratio changed in favor of A2, indicating that A2 might be an oxidative product of A1. LC/ESI-MS/MS data of compound A2 showing fragment ions of m/z 273, 255, 216, 147, and 127 supported this possibility, suggesting ap-coumaroyl-hydroxydehydroagmatine structure (p-coumaroyl-hydroxydehydroagmatine). To our knowledge, both substances have not been previously identified in plants until now. In contrast to the polyamine conjugates of peak 1–4, peak 5 showed a characteristic absorbance spectrum of flavonoids (Fig. 3, panel 5). The λmax of 270 and 337 nm and the molecular mass of 594 Da, determined by ESI-MS, suggested that it was 2-O-glycosylisovitexin. This substance has already been described in young barley shoots (37Osawa T. Katsuzaki H. Hagiwara Y. Hagiwara H. Shibamoto T. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1992; 40: 1135-1138Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thep-coumaroylagmatine derivatives belong to the same compound family as the hordatines, which have been implicated as antifungal factors in barley (31Stoessl A. Can. J. Chem. 1967; 45: 1745-1760Crossref Google Scholar). We therefore tested the influence of fraction A on the appressoria formation frequency of E. graminis (Fig. 5 A; Ref.28Francis S.A. Dewey F.M.

Fraction A at both concentrations showed with about 25% reduction of appressoria formation frequency a comparable antifungal activity to the fungicide benzimidazol, used as positive control. No effect was achieved by applying the HPLC buffer mixture or p-CA. To investigate any dose dependence of the p-coumaroylagmatine derivatives, the purified compounds A1 and A2 were tested in three different concentrations (Fig. 5 B). Both compound"

This function is impaired in Alport syndrome, a hereditary disorder that is caused by mutations in the gene encoding type IV collagen, but it is not known how the mutations lead to a defective GBM. In the present study, the supramolecular organization of type IV collagen of GBM was investigated. This was accomplished by using pseudolysin (EC3.4.24.26) digestion to excise truncated triple-helical protomers for structural studies. Two distinct sets of truncated protomers were solubilized, one at 4 °C and the other at 25 °C, and their chain composition was determined by use of monoclonal antibodies. The 4 °C protomers comprise the α1(IV) and α2(IV) chains, whereas the 25 °C protomers comprised mainly α3(IV), α4(IV), and α5(IV) chains along with some α1(IV) and α2(IV) chains. The structure of the 25 °C protomers was examined by electron microscopy and was found to be characterized by a network containing loops and supercoiled triple helices, which are stabilized by disulfide cross-links between α3(IV), α4(IV), and α5(IV) chains. These results establish a conceptual framework to explain several features of the GBM abnormalities of Alport syndrome. In particular, the α3(IV)·α4(IV)·α5(IV) network, involving a covalent linkage between these chains, suggests a molecular basis for the conundrum in which mutations in the gene encoding the α5(IV) chain cause defective assembly of not only α5(IV) chain but also the α3(IV) and α4(IV) chains in the GBM of patients with Alport syndrome.

Basement membranes are specialized extracellular matrices that compartmentalize tissues, provide substrata for cells, and provide signals for differentiation, maintenance and remodeling of tissues. Prominent basement membranes are the lens capsule (LBM) 1The abbreviations used are: LBM, lens basement membrane; GBM, glomerular basement membrane; STBM, seminiferous tubule basement membrane; NC1, noncollagenous domain; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; GP, Goodpasture; ALP, Alport; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. of eye, seminiferous tubule basement membrane (STBM) of testis, and glomerular basement membrane (GBM) of kidney glomerulus. GBM plays a crucial function in the normal purification of blood plasma, and its function is impaired in at least three prominent renal diseases: diabetic nephropathy, Goodpasture syndrome, and Alport syndrome. In Goodpasture syndrome, a rapidly progressive autoimmune disorder, the target autoantigen is type IV collagen protein, whereas in Alport syndrome, a hereditary form of progressive renal disease, the underlying molecular defects are mutations in the genes encoding type IV collagen (1Hudson B.G. Reeders S.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26033-26036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Type IV collagen, the major component of mammalian basement membranes, is a family of six α(IV) chains (1Hudson B.G. Reeders S.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26033-26036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These are designated α1(IV) to α6(IV) and they are encoded by six distinct genes, COL4A1to COL4A6. The chains are distributed among various basement membranes in a tissue-specific manner, wherein the α1(IV) and α2(IV) chains have a ubiquitous distribution and the α3(IV) to α6(IV) chains have a restricted distribution (2Butkowski R.J.

The chains are assembled into triple-helical molecules (protomers, Fig. 1) composed of three α(IV) chains that self-associate to form supramolecular networks. Several isoforms of protomers are possible that differ in kind and stoichiometry of chains (1Hudson B.G. Reeders S.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol.

Noelken M.E. Lab. Invest. 1989; 61: 256-269PubMed Google Scholar). Three such networks have been identified: a ubiquitous α1(IV)·α2(IV) network and both an α1(IV)–α6(IV) and an α3(IV)–α6(IV) network in STBM (7Kahsai T.Z. Enders G.C. Gunwar S. Brunmark C.

An α3(IV)-containing network, that does not contain α1(IV) and α2(IV) chains, has been identified in GBM (10Johansson C. Butkowski R. Wieslander J. J. Biol.

About 80% of the affected families exhibit X-linked inheritance of mutations in the COL4A5 gene (13Antignac C. Knebelmann B. Drouot L. Gros F. Deschenes G. Hors Cayla M.C. Zhou J. Tryggvason K.

The abnormal GBM in most patients with X-linked Alport syndrome contains only the α1(IV) and α2(IV) chains and is devoid of the α3(IV), α4(IV), and α5(IV) chains (5Peissel B. Geng L. Kalluri R.

A recent study has revealed that this phenomenon reflects an arrest of an early developmental switch, wherein the α1(IV) and α2(IV) chains persist and are not replaced by the α3(IV), α4(IV), and α5(IV) chains that are necessary to form a mature GBM (22Thorner P.S. Zheng K. Kalluri R. Jacobs R. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13821-13828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). How mutations in the α5(IV) chain cause defective assembly of not only the α5(IV) chain, but also the α3(IV) and α4(IV) chains, remains a conundrum. The mechanism linking the assembly of these three chains could be at the protein level in which the α3(IV), α4(IV), and α5(IV) chains are structurally linked into a supramolecular network (5Peissel B. Geng L. Kalluri R. Kashtan C. Rennke H.G. Gallo G.R. Kazuo Y. Sun M.J. Hudson B.G. Neilson E.G. Zhou J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1948-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 22Thorner P.S. Zheng K. Kalluri R. Jacobs R. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13821-13828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), either at the level of triple-helical protomers or at the linkages between triple-helical protomers. The linkage mechanism may also involve the transcriptional/translational level, because the mRNA expression of the α3(IV), α4(IV), and α5(IV) chains appears to be coordinated (22Thorner P.S. Zheng K. Kalluri R. Jacobs R. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13821-13828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to characterize the supramolecular organization of type IV collagen chains in GBM. This was accomplished using pseudolysin cleavage to excise soluble triple-helical molecules for determination of their chain organization. The results revealed that the α3(IV), α4(IV), and α5(IV) chains exist in a novel supramolecular network that is cross-linked by disulfide bonds between triple helices. Moreover, the findings establish a structural linkage between the α3(IV), α4(IV), and α5(IV) chains in GBM, suggesting a molecular basis for the conundrum in which COL4A5 gene mutations in Alport syndrome cause defective assembly of not only the α5(IV) chain, but also the α3(IV) and α4(IV) chains. Bovine kidneys were collected from a local slaughterhouse. GBM was prepared as described by Freytag et al. (23Freytag J.W. Ohno M. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 72: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Pseudolysin was from Nagase Biochemical, Fukuchiyama, Japan; bacterial collagenase (CLSPA) from Worthington; Reacti-gel and bicinchoninic acid-protein assay reagents from Pierce; Sephacryl S-300, S-400, S-1000, and CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; a C18 reversed-phase HPLC column (201 TP 104, 10 μm) from Vydac; nitrocellulose from Schleicher & Schuell; Immobilon from Millipore; a Bio-Gel TSK 250 HPLC gel-filtration column (600 mm length) from Bio-Rad; and prestained protein standards from Life Technologies, Inc. One gram of GBM was suspended in 100 ml of 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5. To this, 10 mg of pseudolysin was added and digestion was carried out at 4 °C for 36 h. The suspension was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm (16,000 × g) in a Sorvall HB-4 rotor to remove un-solubilized GBM. The supernatant contained most of the α1(IV) and α2(IV) chains and the pellet contained primarily α3(IV), α4(IV), and α5(IV) chains. The supernatant solution was brought to 20 mm EDTA, and the digested collagen IV was precipitated by increasing the NaCl concentration to 2 m(23Freytag J.W. Ohno M. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 72: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After 4 h, the precipitate was sedimented at 10,000 rpm (16,000 × g) in a Sorvall HB-4 rotor for 25 min. The pellet was dissolved in 75 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The residual pseudolysin was removed by filtration through a Sephacryl S-1000 column that had been equilibrated against 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5. The fractions free of pseudolysin were pooled and used for further experiments. The 4 °C protomers accounted for 20% of the weight of GBM, based upon absorbance measurements at 280 nm of Sephacryl S-1000 fractions, using an absorbance of 0.38 for a 1 mg/ml in a cell of 1 cm pathlength. The value 0.38 was calculated from the amino acid composition of type IV collagen (24Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). GBM contains ∼40% by weight of type IV collagen (25West T.W. Fox J.W. Jodlowski M. Freytag J.W. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10451-10459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); thus, the 4 °C protomers comprise ∼50% of the type IV collagen of GBM. The pellet from the 4 °C pseudolysin digestion was washed three times with cold water, once with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and then suspended in 50 ml of the same buffer. The suspension was made 0.5% in pseudolysin and 2 mm in CaCl2, and digestion was carried for 24 h at room temperature (25 °C). The reaction was arrested by making the digest 20 mm in EDTA. The suspension was centrifuged for 25 min at 10,000 rpm (16,000 × g). Collagen IV fragments were precipitated by adding NaCl to the cold (4 °C) supernatant solution (final concentration 2 m). After 4 h the precipitate was collected by centrifugation. The pellet was dissolved in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the collagen IV fragments precipitated once again with NaCl and centrifuged as described above. The pellet was suspended in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA and filtered through Sephacryl S-1000 to remove residual pseudolysin. The fractions free of pseudolysin were pooled and used for subsequent experiments. The solubilized 25 °C protomers accounted for 18% of the weight of GBM, and ∼45% of the type IV collagen of GBM, based upon absorbance measurements at 280 nm of Sephacryl S-1000 fractions, using an absorbance of 0.38 for a 1 mg/ml in a cell of 1 cm pathlength. These protomers required pseudolysin at 25 °C for solubilization, as they remained insoluble after increasing the temperature to 25 °C in the absence of pseudolysin. The protein that remained insoluble even after the 25 °C pseudolysin digestion represented 5% of the total GBM, as determined by dry weight measurements, and had a type IV α-chain composition similar to that of the 25 °C protomers. Truncated protomers obtained by 25 °C pseudolysin digestion of GBM and fractionated through the Sephacryl S-1000 column were dialyzed against 6 m guanidine-HCl for 36–48 h and then fractionated on a Sephacryl S-400 column that was equilibrated in the same solution. The fractions were pooled, concentrated using Amicon (Mr cut-off, 30,000) and used for further experiments. The NC1 domains were released from truncated protomers by digestion with bacterial collagenase, and the NC1 hexamers were purified on either a Bio-Sil TSK-250 HPLC gel filtration column or a Sephacryl S-300 column (1.6 × 50 cm) as described previously (26Langeveld J.P.

Fifty mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15m NaCl and 0.05% NaN3, was used for equilibration and elution of the column. The NC1 hexamers were then analyzed by HPLC to quantitate the NC1 domains and by two-dimensional electrophoresis and SDS-PAGE to identify their α(IV) origins using previously established techniques (7Kahsai T.Z. Enders G.C. Gunwar S. Brunmark C. Wieslander J. Kalluri R. Zhou J. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17023-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A sample from the pseudolysin digest that had been fractionated by filtration through a Sephacryl S-1000 column was dissolved in 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol (v/v), pH 8.3, at approximately 1 mg/ml protein concentration. The mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. A 2–3-fold molar excess of sodium iodoacetate was then added, and the mixture was stirred for 4 h in the dark (28Crestfield A.M. Moore W.H. Stein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 622-627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mixture was then centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for further experiments. Pepsin digestion was performed as described by Miller and Rhodes (29Miller E.J. Rhodes R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 33-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The pooled 25 °C protomers from the Sephacryl S-1000 column were precipitated by making the solution 2 m in NaCl. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 0.5m acetic acid (5 mg of protein/ml and then dialyzed against 0.5 m acetic acid at 4 °C. Pepsin was added at 1:10 pepsin-to-substrate ratio, and digestion was performed at 4 °C for 24 h. The collagen IV products were purified by two precipitations with 2 m NaCl, 0.5 m acetic acid. The second precipitate was solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and stored at 4 °C until further use. Two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed as described previously but using 6–22% gradient gels in the second dimension (27Timoneda J. Gunwar S. Monfort G. Saus J. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. Connect. Tissue Res. 1990; 24: 169-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In some cases, either 4–22% or 5–15% gels were used for hexamer or large fragments, respectively. The approximate sizes of the fragments were determined as described previously (30Butkowski R.J. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 410-423Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To determine approximate sizes of complex protomeric molecules, 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously (30Butkowski R.J. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 410-423Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) but using slab gels instead of cylindrical gels.Ascaris suum basement membrane collagen (31Hung C.H. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J.

To prepare Western blots, the electrophoretically separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin, reacted with primary antibody, and stained with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate substrates (32Saus J. Wieslander J. Langeveld J.P. Quinones S. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13374-13380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase conjugate was used as secondary antibody. Primary monoclonal antibodies directed against human α1(IV)–α6(IV)NC1 domains were used for Western blots. The specificity of the monoclonal antibodies was previously established for both human and bovine NC1 domains (8Ninomiya Y. Kagawa M. Iyama K. Naito I. Kishiro Y. Seyer J.M. Sugimoto M. Oohashi T.

About 5 μg of protein was loaded in each lane in SDS-PAGE and 10 μg for two-dimensional electrophoresis. Two-dimensional gels were stained with silver as described by Morrissey (34Morrissey J.H.

Samples (20 μg/ml), in 25% glycerol containing either 150 mm ammonium bicarbonate or 50 mm acetic acid, were sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica sheets, and were rotary-shadowed with platinum at 9° followed by carbon at 90°. Replicas were examined with a JEOL JEM-100CX II electron microscope. The contour length of molecules was measured with a Summagraphics Data Tablet (model MM1201). In our previous studies of STBM and LBM (7Kahsai T.Z. Enders G.C. Gunwar S. Brunmark C. Wieslander J. Kalluri R. Zhou J. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

Such truncated molecules can provide information about the chain composition of protomers and the organization and linkages of protomers in supramolecular networks. The retention of the NC1 domains on the truncated chains allows for the identification of the kind (α1 to α6) of α(IV) chain using NC1-specific monoclonal antibodies. In the present study, truncated protomers were obtained under two separate conditions of pseudolysin digestion. First, the digestion was performed at 4 °C, which solubilized a set of truncated protomers, and then a second digestion of the residual insoluble fraction was performed at 25 °C, which solubilized another set of truncated protomers. The two populations of truncated protomers, designated 4 °C and 25 °C protomers, were characterized (see below) with respect to chain composition and supramolecular organization. The chain compositions were determined using the same chain-specific monoclonal antibodies that were used to determine the distribution of chains in renal tissue (8Ninomiya Y. Kagawa M. Iyama K.

The elution profiles of the digestion mixtures of truncated protomers that were filtered through Sephacryl S-1000 are shown in Fig. 2. For both 4 °C and 25 °C protomers, the elution profiles are broad. However, in each case, SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown) revealed that most of the fractions contained fragments of the same sizes upon reduction of disulfide bonds, indicating a large heterogeneity in size of the constituents of the disulfide-linked complexes. The major result of the fractionation was the removal of pseudolysin. Fractions 20–120 were recombined, and the 4 °C and 25 °C protomers were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to determine the size and distribution of fragments that were dissociated by SDS (Fig. 2, inset). In the 4 °C protomers, some fragments were retained in the stacking gel and those that were resolved by the gel exhibited apparentMr values of <16,000 to >200,000. The apparentMr of the most intense fragment was 160,000. In contrast, those of the 25 °C protomers were of larger size, with a major fragment with an apparent Mr>200,000. The identity of α(IV) chains comprising these molecules was determined by analysis of their respective NC1 domains that were released upon collagenase digestion. The identity of the NC1 domains was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis and Western blotting using chain-specific monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 3). The NC1 domains of the 4 °C protomers showed reactivity with anti-α1(IV) and α2(IV) antibodies, with no reactivity to antibodies directed against α3(IV), α4(IV), α5(IV), and α6(IV) chains (Fig. 3 A). These results indicated that pseudolysin cleaved and selectively solubilized the α1(IV) and α2 chains of GBM at 4 °C. The NC1 domains of the 25 °C protomers showed reactivity to antibodies directed against α1(IV), α2(IV), α3(IV), α4(IV), and α5(IV) chains, and no reactivity toward the α6(IV) chain (Fig. 3 B). This indicated that the 25 °C protomers were mainly composed of the α3(IV), α4(IV), and α5(IV) chains. Goodpasture (GP) autoantibodies and Alport (ALP) alloantibodies also reacted with the NC1 domains of the 25 °C protomers, indicating the presence of the α3(IV) NC1 domain (1Hudson B.G. Reeders S.T.

The present study examined whether the activation of NF-κB is directly involved in the survival of OCLs promoted by IL-1. The expression of IL-1 type I receptor mRNA in OCLs was detected by the polymerase chain reaction amplification of reverse-transcribed mRNA. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that IL-1 transiently activated NF-κB in the nuclei of the OCLs, and the maximal activation occurred at 30 min. The degradation of IκBα coincided with the activation of NF-κB in the OCLs. The immunocytochemical study revealed that p65, a subunit of NF-κB, was translocated from the cytoplasm into almost all of the nuclei of the OCLs within 30 min after IL-1 stimulation. The purified OCLs spontaneously died via apoptosis, and IL-1 promoted the survival of OCLs by preventing their apoptosis. The pretreatment of purified OCLs with proteasome inhibitors suppressed the IL-1-induced activation of NF-κB and prevented the survival of OCLs supported by IL-1. When OCLs were pretreated with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to p65 and p50 of NF-κB, the expression of respective mRNAs by OCLs was suppressed, and the IL-1-induced survival of OCLs was concomitantly inhibited. These results indicate that IL-1 promotes the survival of osteoclasts through the activation of NF-κB."

Although selenium occurs in prokaryotic proteins either as a cofactor or as a selenocysteine residue, mammalian selenoproteins identified thus far contain selenium only in the form of selenocysteine, which is the 21st naturally occurring amino acid in protein. A selenocysteine tRNA that decodes UGA has been found in all life kingdoms, suggesting that the use of UGA as a codon for selenocysteine is widespread in nature (2Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Park J.

Selenoprotein P, a protein of unknown function, is unusual in that it contains ten selenocysteine residues. The function of a selenoprotein W also remains unknown. In the present study, the isolation of the 15-kDa protein and its gene sequence are described which characterize this protein as a member of a class of mammalian selenoproteins. Although this new human selenoprotein does not have homology to known proteins, genes putatively encoding this protein occur in other mammals as well as in nematodes and plants. Preliminary data on this protein have been presented elsewhere (16Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Hatfield D.L. Stadtman T.C. FASEB J. 1997; 11 (A235): 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar).

A human Jurkat T-cell line, JPX9 (17Nagata K. Ohtani K. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. J.

Disrupted cells were centrifuged; the supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column, which had been equilibrated with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA (buffer A); the column was washed with 2 volumes of buffer A; and proteins were eluted by application of a linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing 75Se were analyzed on SDS gels. Fractions containing the 15-kDa selenoprotein that eluted from the DEAE column with 350 mm NaCl were combined, concentrated, adjusted to a concentration of 0.5 m ammonium sulfate in buffer A, and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated in 1 m ammonium sulfate in buffer A; the column was washed by application of a linear gradient from 0.5 to 0m ammonium sulfate in buffer A; and radioactive fractions corresponding to the 15-kDa protein were eluted by application of a linear gradient from buffer A to water. Radioactive fractions were combined, concentrated, and loaded on a C18 reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography column that had been equilibrated in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, a gradient of 0 to 60% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid applied and75Se-containing fractions corresponding to the 15-kDa protein eluted at 48% acetonitrile.

The molecular mass of the 15-kDa selenoprotein was determined by electrospray and MALDI mass-spectrometry in fractions from the C18 column. Both mass spectra revealed a single strong signal of the 15-kDa protein. The native molecular mass of the 15-kDa selenoprotein purified on a DEAE-Sepharose column was determined using native PAGE and analytical high performance liquid chromatography gel filtration as described (18Gladyshev V.N. Khangulov S.V. Stadtman T.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 213-223Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The 15-kDa selenoprotein was detected as 75Se-labeled fractions from a gel-filtration column and as a 75Se-labeled band on native PAGE. For determination of sequences of internal peptides, the 15-kDa selenoprotein was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained with Ponceau S. The stained single 15-kDa band was removed and submitted to Harvard Microchem (Boston, MA), where the 15-kDa selenoprotein was digested with trypsin and the resulting peptides were separated on a reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography column and analyzed by MALDI mass-spectrometry and amino acid sequencing. Amino acid composition of the 15-kDa protein was also determined at Harvard Microchem. These data were carefully analyzed and found to be consistent with other experimental data (mass spectrometry, SDS-PAGE analyses, immunoblot assays). Rabbit antibodies were raised against a synthetic polypeptide corresponding to residues 145–162 of the human 15-kDa protein and used for Western blot analyses with ECL systems. Plasmids were isolated according to the instructions provided with the plasmid purification kit (Qiagen), the sequencing reaction products were purified on separation columns as described by the manufacturer (Princeton Separations), and the nucleotide sequences of EST clones were determined using a Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit as described by the manufacturer (Perkin-Elmer). Three different peptide sequences from the 15-kDa selenoprotein were analyzed for matches to the data base of expressed sequence tags (dbEST) of partial cDNA sequences (19Boguski M.S. Lowe T.M.J.

Multiple alignments of expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences and their translated products were viewed using the MSPcrunch/Blixem system (23Sonnhammer E.L. Durbin R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 301-307PubMed Google Scholar). The Blixem alignments also revealed polymorphic sites in the human ESTs that were clearly distinct from sequencing errors. A human T-cell line, JPX9, was grown in the presence of 75Se, and the extracts of75Se-labeled cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager detection of radioactivity on the gels. One of the major75Se-labeled proteins that migrated as a 15-kDa band on SDS-PAGE was purified initially on DEAE-Sepharose and phenyl-Sepharose columns and then further on a reversed-phase column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resulting protein preparation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A major protein band migrating as a 15-kDa species was detected by staining the gels with Coomassie Blue and by PhosphorImager detection of radioactivity in the gel (Fig. 1). The purity of the 15-kDa protein was estimated to be about 50%. The native 15-kDa selenoprotein migrated as a 240-kDa species on a native gradient PAGE and was eluted as a 200-kDa species from a calibrated gel-filtration column (not shown). It was not determined whether the native 200–240 kDa protein is composed of multiple identical 15-kDa Se-containing subunits or is a hetero-oligomeric complex. The molecular mass of the 15-kDa selenoprotein subunit in fractions from the C18 column determined by MALDI mass-spectrometry was 14,830 Da. Electrospray mass-spectrometry of the same preparation revealed a molecular mass of 14,870 Da. The N terminus of the protein was blocked, which prevented determination of the N-terminal sequence. Amino acid analysis revealed the lack of internal methionine and histidine residues, as well as the hydrophobic character of the protein (TableI).Table IAmino acid composition of the human 15-kDa selenoproteinAmino acid162 Residues135 ResiduesExperimental dataA1389.1R876.5N55NDD88NDC87NDE1313NDQ87NDG131012.9H00<0.5I555.0L262019.2K999.3M10<0.5F1097.5P645.0S131111.4T323.2W11NDY222.7V966.7U11NDE+Q212021.4D+N131314.6 Open table in a new tab The sequences of three different tryptic peptides and one overlapping peptide from the 15-kDa protein were determined (Fig. 2). Computer searches of the partial cDNAs in the dbEST using TBLASTN program revealed nucleotide sequences that corresponded to all three peptides in the same ORF. Several human dbEST sequences corresponded perfectly to peptides from the 15-kDa protein and were used to assemble an open reading frame (Fig. 2). The two cDNA clones containing the longest 5′ sequences were obtained from IMAGE and sequenced. These clones revealed a continuous nucleotide sequence of 1268 nucleotides, containing a single open reading frame of 162 amino acid residues and a 3′-end poly(A) tail. A single ATG codon occurred in a nucleotide context, GCGATGG, that is similar to the Kozak consensus sequence for initiation of translation (24Kozak M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2482-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). This initiation ATG codon was followed by a 489-nucleotide open reading frame with an in-frame TAA termination codon. The obtained ORF included an in-frame TGA codon, suggesting the presence of a selenocysteine residue, Sec-93 (2Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Park J. Park S.I. Chittum H.S. Baek H.J. Carlson B.A. Yang E.S. Moustafa M.E. Lee B.J. Compr. Nat. Prod. Chem. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). Three tryptic peptides for which sequences have been determined corresponded to deduced sequences located downstream of the TGA codon, indicating readthrough of the TGA codon rather than termination of translation. Although selenocysteine was not directly identified as a component of the 15-kDa protein, the labeling of the protein with75Se, readthrough of the TGA codon, and the location of selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element in the untranslated area (Fig. 2) suggest the presence of selenocysteine in the protein. The predicted ORF encoded a protein of 17,790.6 Da. The mass of the purified 15-kDa protein was 14,870 Da, and this discrepancy suggested post-translational processing of the protein. Processing of the 15-kDa protein appears to occur at the N-terminal portion of the protein. That is, antiserum was raised to a synthetic peptide that was identical in sequence to the eighteen C-terminal residues of the 15-kDa protein, and thus the antigenic site resides near the C terminus. As shown in Fig. 1, this antiserum recognized 15-kDa protein at different stages of purification. In addition, one of the sequenced tryptic peptides obtained from digests of the 15-kDa protein corresponded to residues 146–158, which are located near the C terminus according to the predicted gene sequence. The N-terminal portion of the putative precursor of the 15-kDa protein, as predicted from the gene sequence, had a stretch of hydrophobic amino acid residues, suggesting the presence of a signal peptide. Cleavage of these N-terminal amino acid residues is consistent with the amino acid composition of the protein (Table I) since the processed protein matches more closely the amino acid analysis data obtained for the purified 15-kDa protein than the full size 17-kDa protein. One possible site for post-translational processing is Ser-27, which coincides with the site of an exon-intron junction (not shown), making this residue the evolutionary favorable site for post-translational processing. The unknown nature of the N-terminal modifying group in the purified protein makes it difficult to predict the exact site of post-translational cleavage. Computer sequence analyses of the 15-kDa protein and its gene sequence revealed no homology to known proteins. However, a number of dbEST sequences from mouse, rat, B. malayi, C. elegans, and rice showed strong homology in TBLASTN searches with the 15-kDa human protein (Fig. 3). Mouse partial cDNA sequences were assembled into a full-length open reading frame, whereas rat, C. elegans, B. malayi, and rice sequences gave only partial coding sequences. Interestingly, although mouse and rat genes encode potential selenocysteine-containing 15-kDa proteins, the genes in C. elegans and B. malayiencode homologous proteins containing cysteine in place of selenocysteine. This is consistent with observations that nematode genes for glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase encode cysteine analogs of mammalian selenocysteine-containing proteins. The regions flanking Sec-93 in the human 15-kDa protein had the highest degree of homology among proteins from different organisms, suggesting that the selenocysteine residue is located in a putative active center. In other mammalian selenocysteine-containing proteins in which the function is established, the selenocysteine residue is located at the active center, and it is essential for catalytic activity of the selenoenzyme (1Stadtman T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 2Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Park J. Park S.I. Chittum H.S. Baek H.J. Carlson B.A. Yang E.S. Moustafa M.E. Lee B.J. Compr. Nat. Prod. Chem. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). In addition to partial cDNA sequences summarized in Fig. 3, we have detected additional homologous human and mouse cDNAs relatively distantly related to the sequence for the human 15-kDa protein. These encode hypothetical proteins that have in-frame TGA in the position corresponding to the TGA encoding selenocysteine in the 15-kDa selenoprotein gene. The sequences of human and mouse genes for this protein were recently experimentally verified. 2V. Gladyshev and D. Hatfield, unpublished data. These observations suggest that the 15-kDa selenoprotein establishes a new class of eukaryotic selenium-containing proteins. Approximately 120 partial cDNA sequences in dbEST were found to match the human 15-kDa protein DNA sequence (within experimental error or expected frequencies of natural polymorphism). This sampling represents a sufficient abundance of independent clones to reveal the approximate tissue distribution of expression of this relatively highly expressed gene (expression as mRNA). cDNA libraries from 32 different adult, fetal, or embryonic tissues or organs were represented in this set of sequences. Table II shows the ranked incidence of these clones in tissues and organs for which at least one library has two or more independent 15-kDa protein cDNAs in dbEST.Table IIIncidence of the human 15-kDa protein gene expressionLibraryIncidence per 10,000 ESTs (numbers/library size)Thyroid19.9 (4/2014)Parathyroid tumor (Soares NbHPA)18.4 (12/6511)Prostate pre-cancerous cells (CGAP_Pr2)15.4 (3/1945)Prostate11.2 (2/1792)Fetal lung (Soares NbHL19W)9.8 (9/9145)Colon carcinoma (3 libraries)5.6 (2/3358, 1/2791, 1/956)Aorta4.4 (2/4595)Fetal retina (Stratagene 937202)4.3 (2/4610)Jurkat T-cells (2 libraries)4.3 (2/3534, 1/3420)Retina (2 libraries)4.1 (3/8915, 2/3368)Neuroepithelium (Stratagene 937231)3.7 (2/5385)Colon (Stratagene 937204)3.3 (3/8974)Testis (Soares NHT)2.9 (4/13657)Fetal heart (Soares NbHH19W)2.3 (6/25708)Germinal B-cells (CGAP_GCB1)1.0 (2/19194) Open table in a new tab Clearly, the 15-kDa protein gene exhibits a very broad spectrum of moderate expression in many tissues, and significantly higher levels of mRNA are shown by thyroid, parathyroid tumor, prostate, and pre-cancerous prostate cells. Expression estimates from dbEST library frequencies should be considered to be only semi-quantitative, considering that some libraries are normalized and variable levels of tissue contamination may exist. More quantitative representative estimates are given by the stringent CGAP (Cancer Gene Anatomy Project) libraries (25Strausberg R.L. Dahl C.A. Klausner R.D. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 415-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) prepared from small numbers of laser-microdissected cells, for example the pre-cancerous prostate library CGAP_Pr2 (Ref.26Krizman D.B Chuaqui R.F.

Irrespective of the quantitative uncertainties, this large body of partial cDNA sequence data strongly demonstrates that the 15-kDa protein gene is expressed in a wide range of tissues, with increased levels of mRNA in the thyroid, parathyroid, and prostate-derived cells. Although in this report we describe the human 15-kDa protein gene expression as the expression of mRNA inferred from data base analysis, we detected the mouse analog of this human selenoprotein in immunoblot assays in prostate, heart, kidney, spleen, liver, and other mouse organs, with the highest level observed in prostate, suggesting the expression of both mRNA and the selenoprotein in many tissues and cell lines.2 Studies of the mechanism of selenocysteine incorporation into several eukaryotic selenoproteins have implicated related stem-loop structures, located in the mRNA 3′-UTR, as essential for selenocysteine insertion into proteins at a UGA codon in the coding sequence. The general structural features of this SECIS (selenocysteine insertion sequence) element have been deduced previously (3Low S. Berry M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 27Walczak R. Westhof E. Carbon P. Krol A. RNA. 1996; 2: 367-379PubMed Google Scholar), based on chemical probe experiments and sequence alignments, as summarized in Fig. 4 a. To locate potential SECIS elements in the 15-kDa protein mRNAs, the human and mouse cDNAs were searched for sequences meeting the following constraints (see Fig. 4 a): Helix I, at least 4 base pairs; Internal loop, 3–9 nucleotides;Quartet (the non-Watson-Crick base-paired motif), UGAN (following A in Internal loop) … NGAN (following the downstream strand of Helix II); Helix II, 9–15 standard base pairs extending the Quartet; Apical loop, 10–20 nucleotides starting with AA(A/G). Single base mismatches or bulges were allowed within helices longer than 6 base pairs. Sequences meeting these stringent criteria were found in both the human and mouse 3′-UTRs, ending approximately 60 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A) addition signal sequence (Fig. 2). Fig. 4 b shows these human and mouse sequences aligned with the canonical SECIS element (3Low S. Berry M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 27Walczak R. Westhof E. Carbon P. Krol A. RNA. 1996; 2: 367-379PubMed Google Scholar) of the human glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX-1) mRNA 3′-UTR. The 15-kDa protein mRNAs exhibit all the features known to be necessary in other eukaryotic selenoprotein mRNAs to promote selenocysteine insertion. It was also noted from the alignments of multiple human sequences from dbEST that a probable G/A substitution polymorphism occurred at an Apical loop nucleotide (position 1125, Fig. 4 b). Examination of the primary sequencer trace data (openly available on the Washington University server,http://genome.wustl.edu/est/est_general/trace_intro.html) confirmed that authentic G or A bases occur at this position and are not sequencing errors. An additional site of substitution (C/T) polymorphism was observed at the 811 position of the human 15-kDa protein cDNA sequence (not shown). Computer analyses revealed the UNIGENE cluster of ESTs (28Boguski M.S. Schuler G.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 369-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), corresponding to the 15-kDa human selenoprotein, maps to human chromosome 1, at the position 117–123 cM on the human transcript gene map, corresponding approximately to 1p31 (29Schuler G.D. Boguski M.S. Stewart E.A. Stein L.D. Gyapay G. Rice K. White R.E. Rodriguez-Tome P. Aggarwal A. Bajorek E. Bentolila S. Birren B.B. Butler A. Castle A.B. Chiannilkulchai N. Chu A. Clee C. Cowles S.

We have detected a new selenoprotein in human T cells designated as the 15-kDa protein. Although the function of this protein is not known, certain selenoproteins have been associated with a chemopreventive role in cancer (2Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Park J. Park S.I. Chittum H.S. Baek H.J. Carlson B.A. Yang E.S. Moustafa M.E. Lee B.J. Compr. Nat. Prod. Chem. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). Interestingly, there are certain correlations between the occurrence of the newly described 15-kDa protein in cancer tissue and the effect of selenium on cancer that are worthy of discussion. For example, recent studies have shown that supplementation of the diet with selenium in human clinical trials resulted in 63% reduction in prostate cancer and, to a lesser extent, in the reduction of colon and lung cancers (30Clark L.C. Combs G.F. Turnbull B.W. Slate E.H. Chalker D.K. Chow J. Davis L.S. Glover R.A. Graham G.F. Gross E.G. Krongrad A. Lesher J.L. Park H.K. Sanders B.B. Smith C.L. Taylor J.R. JAMA. 1996; 276: 1957-1963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the 15-kDa protein is highly expressed in prostate tissue (see TableII) and thus some of the protective properties of selenium in prostate cancer may be mediated through this protein. In addition, our preliminary data suggest that the levels of the 15-kDa protein and its mRNA are decreased in some cancers (e.g. liver of c-myc/TGFα transgenic mice2). Studies to determine whether the 15-kDa protein may play a role in delaying the progression of certain cancers including prostate cancer are in progress.

However, the molecular mechanisms of this regulation are not clearly understood. Inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity in response to dopamine is associated with endocytosis of its α- and β-subunits, an effect that is protein kinase C-dependent. In this study we used isolated proximal tubule cells and a cell line derived from opossum kidney and demonstrate that dopamine-induced endocytosis of Na+,K+-ATPase and inhibition of its activity were accompanied by phosphorylation of the α-subunit. Inhibition of both the enzyme activity and its phosphorylation were blocked by the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide. The early time dependence of these processes suggests a causal link between phosphorylation and inhibition of enzyme activity. However, after 10 min of dopamine incubation, the α-subunit was no longer phosphorylated, whereas enzyme activity remained inhibited due to its removal from the plasma membrane. Dephosphorylation occurred in the late endosomal compartment. To further examine whether phosphorylation was a prerequisite for subunit endocytosis, we used the opossum kidney cell line transfected with the rodent α-subunit cDNA. Treatment of this cell line with dopamine resulted in phosphorylation and endocytosis of the α-subunit with a concomitant decrease in Na+,K+-ATPase activity. In contrast, none of these effects were observed in cells transfected with the rodent α-subunit that lacks the putative protein kinase C-phosphorylation sites (Ser11 and Ser18). Our results support the hypothesis that protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of the α-subunit is essential for Na+,K+-ATPase endocytosis and that both events are responsible for the decreased enzyme activity in response to dopamine.

Changes in vectorial transport of sodium induced by DA in renal tubules are largely mediated by inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase (4Bertorello A.M. Katz A.I. Am. J.

Physiol. 1990; 258: F514-F521PubMed Google Scholar). At the cellular level, DA triggers a specific signaling cascade that ultimately activates protein kinase C (PKC) (7Satoh T. Cohen H.T. Katz A.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F399-F405PubMed Google Scholar), a process postulated to be responsible for the decreased Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Activators of PKC, such as phorbol esters and diacylglycerol analogs, decrease Na+,K+-ATPase activity in isolated rat renal PCT segments (7Satoh T. Cohen H.T. Katz A.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F399-F405PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bertorello A.M. Aperia A. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F370-F373PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the vectorial transport of sodium by isolated perfused PCTs (9Baum M. Hays S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: F9-F14PubMed Google Scholar). In isolated renal PCT cells, another activator of PKC,l-1-oleoyl-2-acetoyl-sn,n-acetoyl-glycerol, decreased Na+,K+-ATPase activity determined as the rate of ouabain-sensitive oxygen consumption (10Bertorello A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 343-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a renal cell line derived from opossum kidney (OK cells), but not from pig kidney (LLC-PK1 cells), incubation with phorbol esters resulted in phosphorylation of the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit and inhibition of its activity (11Middleton J.P. Khan W.A. Collinsworth G. Hannun Y.A. Medford R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15958-15964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, stimulation of Na+,K+-ATPase by phorbol esters has also been reported (12Carranza M.L. Féraille E. Favre H. Am. J.

Although phosphorylation of the α-subunit by PKC in a cell-free preparation was associated with a decrease in enzymatic activity (14Bertorello A.M. Aperia A. Walaas S.I. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc.

J. Clin. Invest. 1974; 54: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Contrary to the diverse effects of PKC stimulation by phorbol esters and diacylglycerols on Na+,K+-ATPase activity, there is a consensus on the inhibitory action of DA on the enzyme. Moreover, we have recently demonstrated that inhibition of PCT Na+,K+-ATPase activity by DA is associated with endocytosis of its α- and β-subunits into early- (EE) and late (LE) endosomes via a clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV)-dependent mechanism (22Chibalin A.V. Katz A.I. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1458-C1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, despite the information gained during the last few years on the regulation of Na+,K+-ATPase activity, it is not known whether inhibition of enzyme activity in intact cells depends on the phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit, or whether such phosphorylation is necessary for subunit endocytosis in response to a physiologic agonist such as DA. In the present study, using intact renal PCT cells metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, we have examined whether dopamine phosphorylates the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit and whether this effect is responsible for the decreased enzymatic activity and subunit endocytosis. The cAMP analog Rp-cAMPS was obtained from BioLog, Bremen, Germany. Bisindolylmaleimide was purchased from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA. All other chemicals were from Sigma. A monoclonal antibody, kindly provided by Dr. M. Caplan (Yale University), was used against the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (antibody A, which recognizes only the N-terminal first five residues of the α-subunit). Immunoprecipitation of the Na+,K+-ATPase in the phosphorylation experiments and Western blots were performed using a polyclonal antibody (B) raised against the rat Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (23Pietrini G. Matteoli M. Banker G. Caplan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 89: 8414-8418Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The identity of EE was determined with a polyclonal antibody raised against arab5 synthetic peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The late endosome fraction was identified with a mannose-6-phosphate receptor antibody (courtesy of Dr. B. Hoflack, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). PCT cells were prepared as described before (10Bertorello A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 343-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Seri I. Kone B.C. Gullans S.R. Aperia A. Brenner B.M. Ballerman B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F52-F60PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, male Sprague-Dawley rats (BK Universal, Sollentuna, Sweden) weighing between 150–200 g were used. After the kidneys were removed and the cortex isolated, the tissue was minced on ice to a paste-like consistency. The cortical minceate was incubated with 0.7 mg/ml collagenase (Type I, Sigma) in 50 ml of Hanks' medium (Life Technologies,Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 60 min, where the solution was continuously exposed to 95% O2, 5% CO2and was terminated by placing the tissue on ice and pouring through graded sieves (180–75-53–38 μm pore size) to obtain a cell suspension. It has been reported that phorbol esters regulate Na,K-ATPase differently depending on whether the tissue has been continously oxygenated during its preparation and incubation with the PKC activator. Although this effect was not reported to be involved in the DA response, we had taken the precaution to incubate cells in oxygenated solutions in all steps until the tissue was disrupted to immunoprecipitate the α-subunit or for preparation of BLM, EE, and LE. The expression vector pCMV containing the rodent Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit cDNA was obtained from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Preparation of the expression vector (myc/1.32) that encodes a shortened mutant of the α1-subunit was as described by Shanbaky and Pressley (25Shanbaky N.M. Pressley T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C590-C597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This vector expresses a rodent α-subunit in which the first 31 amino acids of the nascent polypeptide are replaced by an initiation methionine and a sequence of 10 amino acids (EQKLISEEDL) from the human c-myc oncogene product. Transfection of OK cells and selection of ouabain-resistant colonies were performed as described previously (26Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Cinelli A.R. Lokhandwala M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in modified Hanks' medium in the presence or absence of 1 μm DA at room temperature for different periods of time. The incubation was terminated by placing the samples on ice. Cell aliquots (approximately 10–20 μg of protein) were transferred to the Na+,K+-ATPase assay medium (final volume of 100 μl) containing in mm NaCl, 50; KCl, 5; MgCl2, 10; EGTA, 1; Tris-HCl, 50; Na2ATP, 7 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA); and [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products, specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol) in tracer amounts (3.3 nCi/μl). Na+,K+-ATPase activity was determined in permeabilized cells as described before (27Doucet A. Katz A.I. Morel F. Am. J. Physiol. 1979; 237: F105-F113PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bertorello A.M. Hopfield J. Aperia A. Greengard P. Nature. 1990; 347: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Renal PCT cells (4–6 mg of protein/3 ml) were labeled during 2 h at 32 °C in a buffer containing (in mm) NaCl, 120; KCl, 5; NaHCO3, 4; CaCl2, 1; MgSO4, 1; NaH2PO4, 0.2; Na2HPO4, 0.15; glucose, 5; lactate, 10; pyruvate, 1; HEPES, 20; and 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.45, with the addition of 250 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (NEN Life Science Products). OK cells (2.0–2.5 mg of protein/dish) were labeled in the same buffer (2.5 ml/dish) containing 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 2.5 h at 37 °C. All incubations with different agonists were performed at room temperature. The incubation was terminated by removing the medium and adding cold immunoprecipitation buffer. Immunoprecipitation of the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit was performed as described by Carranza et al.(12Carranza M.L. Féraille E. Favre H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C136-C143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots (200 μg of protein) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of rabbit polyclonal antibody and with the simultaneous addition of excess protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using the Laemmli buffer system (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore) and subjected to autoradiography. Phosphoproteins were also analyzed using a phosphoimager (Fuji, Japan), and quantitation was performed as described (22Chibalin A.V. Katz A.I. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1458-C1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were labeled with32P as detailed above. Cells in suspension (1.5 mg of protein/ml) were incubated under different protocols at room temperature. Incubation was terminated by transferring the samples to ice and adding cold homogenization buffer containing 250 mmsucrose and 3 mm imidazole, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 30 mmNa4O7P2, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4. Cells were gently homogenized (15–20 strokes) to minimize damage of the endosomes, using a Dounce homogenizer, and the samples were subjected to a brief (5 min) centrifugation (4 °C, 3,000 ×g). Endosomes were fractionated on a flotation gradient as described (22Chibalin A.V. Katz A.I. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1458-C1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using essentially the technique of Gorvel et al. (30Gorvel J.-P Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). After separation of EE and LE, another fraction (500 μl) was collected at the 16 and 42% sucrose interface corresponding to cell ghosts, mitochondria, and plasma membranes. Basolateral membranes (BLM) were further purified according to Hammond et al. (31Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. Majewski R.R. Muse K.E. Oberley T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F516-F527PubMed Google Scholar), using a Percoll gradient. Briefly, the collected material was diluted by adding 500 μl of imidazole (3 mm, pH 7.4) buffer containing protease inhibitors (final sucrose concentration 25–26% w/w), and spun at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The yellow layer was resuspended again in the supernatant (carefully removed from the brown pellet containing mitochondria and cell ghosts) and centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer (300 mmmannitol and 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, adjusted with Tris) by gentle pipetting. To form a Percoll gradient, 0.19 g of undiluted Percoll (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was added to a 1-ml suspension (0.2–1 mg of protein). The suspension was gently mixed and centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 30 min, and the ring of BLM was collected. Protein content was determined according to Bradford (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 72: 248-254Crossref Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Western blots were developed with an ECL (Amersham, UK) detection kit. Scans were performed using a ScanJet IIc scanner (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA). Quantitation of the phosphorylated Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit was performed using a Fuji Bas 1000 Bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji, Japan), and the data (arbitrary units) were analyzed using Tina 2.07 ray test software (Isotopenmessyeräte GmbH, Staulenhardt, Germany). Comparison between two experimental groups were made by the unpaired Student's t test. For multiple comparisons, one-way ANOVA with Sheffe's correction was used.p < 0.05 was considered significant. In this study we sought to determine whether inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity and endocytosis was associated with phosphorylation of the α-subunit. In isolated renal PCT cells, incubation with DA decreased Na+,K+-ATPase activity (nmol Pi/mg prot/min, vehicle: 112 ± 8 versus DA, 1 μm: 60 ± 2, n = 4,p < 0.05), and this effect was blocked by PKC inhibitors (7Satoh T. Cohen H.T. Katz A.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F399-F405PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bertorello A.M. Aperia A. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F370-F373PubMed Google Scholar). Intact renal PCT cells were metabolically labeled with 32P and thereafter incubated for 2.5 min at room temperature with or without DA (Fig. 1 A). The α-subunit was immunoprecipitated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. In every experiment the amount of radioactivity (autoradiography or phosphoimager) incorporated into the α-subunit was corrected for the amount of protein present (Western blot), and the quantitative data are shown as percent of control at thebottom of each panel. DA increased the state of phosphorylation (to ∼165% of control) of the α-subunit, as illustrated in Fig. 1 A. This increased phosphorylation was inhibited by bisindolylmaleimide, a specific PKC inhibitor, but not by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibitor, suggesting that phosphorylation of the α-subunit induced by DA is mediated by PKC. Neither inhibitor affected the state of α-subunit phosphorylation in non-stimulated PCT cells. Phosphorylation of the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit by DA was time-dependent (Fig. 1 B). It increased significantly after 1 min and was maximal at 2.5 min (178% of control), whereas it was no longer evident at 10 min. However, while the initial (1.0 and 2.5 min) increase in α-subunit phosphorylation corresponded to the decrease in enzyme activity, this correlation was no longer present at 10 min, i.e. enzyme activity remained inhibited (percent of control, 60 ± 3,p < 0.05), whereas phosphorylation was similar to that of control cells. To determine whether the Na+,K+-ATPase has been dephosphorylated, we examined the effect of DA in the presence of a phosphatase inhibitor, 1 μm okadaic acid (OKD) (Fig. 1 C). Basal phosphorylation (resting condition =control, C) was moderately higher (∼1.5-fold) in the OKD-treated cells. As hypothesized, in OKD-treated cells, DA (10 min) did increase the state of α-subunit phosphorylation, suggesting that at this time period it had been dephosphorylated by the action of protein phosphatases. Because after 10 min the α-subunit has been dephosphorylated yet the decreased enzymatic activity persisted, it is possible that the dephosphorylated α-subunits no longer reside in the plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the state of phosphorylation of the α-subunit in BLM and in LE. In BLM prepared from cells that have been preincubated with DA for 10 min, the state of phosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated α-subunit remained unchanged regardless of whether the PCT cells were previously treated with 1 μmOKD or not, whereas it increased significantly in LE. This was evident, however, only if PCT cells had been preincubated with OKD (phosphorylation (percent of control): 104 ± 6 without OKDversus 126 ± 5 OKD-treated cells, n = 3), supporting the notion that the α-subunit is dephosphorylated in LE. In BLM prepared from cells that have been preincubated with DA for 2.5 min (Fig. 2 A, left panel) the state of phosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated α-subunit was significantly increased, regardless of whether the PCT cells were previously treated with 1 μm OKD or not (phosphorylation (percent of control): 130 ± 2.0 without OKD, 131 ± 1.2 with OKD). These results suggest that the phosphorylated subunits (2.5 min) in the BLM are not affected by protein phosphatases Although the results described above support the concept that in response to DA the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunits are phosphorylated in the plasma membrane and then internalized and dephosphorylated in LE, the link between these two processes (i.e. whether phosphorylation is a requisite for endocytosis) is not clear. Therefore, we next used an epithelial cell line from OK transfected with the rat Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit cDNA carrying a deletion in the nascent 28 amino acids in which Ser11 and Ser18, the putative phosphorylation sites for PKC (33Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14072-14077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 34Logvinenko N.S Duluvoba I. Fedosova N. Larsson S.H. Nairn A.C. Esmann M. Greengard P. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9132-9137Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), are absent. OK cells (non-transfected) behaved similarly to native PCT cells in their response to DA: DA decreased the Na+,K+-ATPase activity, and this inhibition was associated with endocytosis of the α-subunit. Thus, they constitute a useful model to study the mechanisms of action of DA. The relative expression of Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunits in transfected OK cells was determined using antibody A raised against the first five amino acids of the α-subunit (which should not recognize the truncated form, OKαrat-t) and compared with antibody B, raised against the holoenzyme. While antibody B recognized the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit from both the full-length (OKαrat) and OKαrat-tcells, antibody A detected only a slight presence of Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunits in OKαrat-t (Fig. 3 A), indicating that in OKαrat-t most of the α-subunits correspond to the truncated form. We next evaluated the Na+,K+-ATPase activity and its response to DA in OKαrat and OKαrat-t (Fig. 3 B). While basal Na+,K+-ATPase activity was similar in both groups of cells and comparable with that in earlier reports (13Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Lokhandwala M.F. Cinelli A.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 155: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Cinelli A.R. Lokhandwala M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), incubation with DA resulted in a significant decrease in Na+,K+-ATPase activity from OKαrat (p < 0.01), but not from OKαrat-t (p = 0.567). The inhibitory effect of DA in OKαrat was abolished by coincubation with a PKC inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide (percent of control: 99.3 ± 7, n = 3). We further examined whether this inhibition was associated with phosphorylation of the α-subunit (Fig. 3 C). 1 μm DA (3 min; room temperature) increased the state of phosphorylation of the α-subunit in OKαrat but not in OKαrat-t cells. Last, to determine whether phosphorylation of the α-subunit was necessary for endocytosis, early and late endosomes were prepared from OKαrat and OKαrat-t cells incubated with DA (Fig. 4). DA stimulated the incorporation of α-subunits into EE and LE from OKαrat, and this effect was blocked by bisindolylmaleimide (percent of control, EE: 105 ± 12, n = 3; and LE: 96 ± 17,n = 3) or calphostin C (percent of control, EE: 98 ± 13, n = 3; and LE: 86 ± 11, n= 3). However, DA did not increase the incorporation of α-subunits from OKαrat-t. In this report we have demonstrated that DA treatment of both isolated proximal tubule cells and OK cells transfected with the rodent α-subunit leads to inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity and phosphorylation and endocytosis of the α-subunit. In contrast, when the DA effect was examined in OK cells expressing the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit isoform in which the putative PKC-phosphorylation sites were removed, DA-treatment neither inhibited the enzyme activity nor induced any significant phosphorylation or endocytosis of the α-subunit. These observations strongly suggest a causal link between PKC-dependent phosphorylation of amino acids at the α-subunit N terminus and Na+,K+-ATPase inhibition and endocytosis in response to a physiological agonist. Inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity by DA in renal PCT involves the sequential activation of arachidonic acid, 20-HETE, and PKC (35Ominato M. Satoh T. Katz A.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 152: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Although cAMP stimulation has been suggested to contribute to the action of DA (36Bertorello A.M. Aperia A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F924-F928PubMed Google Scholar, 37Takemoto F. Cohen H.T. Satoh T. Katz A.I. Pfluegers Arch. 1992; 421: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that it would be directly involved in Na+,K+-ATPase regulation (phosphorylation of the α-subunit in renal PCT cells) because increased cAMP in this segment does not inhibit (7Satoh T. Cohen H.T. Katz A.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F399-F405PubMed Google Scholar) but is rather associated with stimulation of Na+,K+-ATPase activity (38Carranza M.L. Féraille E. Kiroytcheva M. Rousselot M. Favre H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Accordingly, in this study phosphorylation of Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunits was blocked by PKC-, but not cAMP-K, inhibition. Our observation differs from that reported by Beguin et al.(39Beguin P. Beggah A. Cotecchia S. Geering K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C131-C137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), perhaps reflecting differences in the preparations used. We examined isolated PCT cells, where DA is synthetized and physiologically regulates Na+,K+-ATPase activity, whereas Beguin et al. (39Beguin P. Beggah A. Cotecchia S. Geering K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C131-C137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) used a reconstituted system in which the receptor (human dopaminergic DA1A) and the target (Bufo marinusNa+,K+-ATPase α-subunit) were expressed in a cell line (COS-7) that normally does not express this regulatory system. The present results suggest that inhibition of total cell Na+,K+-ATPase activity is initially accomplished by phosphorylation of the α-subunit and that the activity remains decreased because the inhibited units no longer reside in the plasma membrane. Once the α-subunits become phosphorylated, they are internalized by sequential translocation into CCV, EE, and finally LE, where they may be dephosphorylated. Because in CCV and EE the increased Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit abundance is not associated with increased enzymatic activity (22Chibalin A.V. Katz A.I. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1458-C1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is unlikely that it could have been dephosphorylated in these compartments. Endocytosis of the α-subunit requires phosphorylation by PKC because mutants lacking the PKC phosphorylation sites do not internalize in response to dopamine. The mechanisms by which membrane proteins are internalized have been studied extensively, and the consensus sequences of interaction with adaptins have been described. The amino acids that were deleted by the truncation do not bear any homology with known endocytic sequences. Thus, it appears that it is the lack of phosphorylation rather than impairment of a putative Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit-adaptin interaction that precludes the dopamine-dependent endocytosis in cells transfected with the truncated isoform. However, Beron et al. (40Beron J. Forster I. Beguin P. Geering K. Verrey F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), using phorbol esters to stimulate PKC, have recently postulated that PKC activation is not necessary for Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit endocytosis in A6 cells. These observations, however, are not comparable with the effect of DA in PCT cells. Phorbol esters increased fluid phase endocytosis, and the signal could thus have occurred at any other target in the plasma membrane. In PCT cells, by contrast, DA selectively internalized the Na+,K+-ATPase α/β-subunits while the distribution of other basolateral membrane markers such as the glucose transporter GLUT-2 and the mannose 6-phosphate receptor remained unchanged (22Chibalin A.V. Katz A.I. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1458-C1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of PCT cells with phorbol esters, on the other hand, resulted in internalization of the GLUT-2 transporter as well as the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit and also induced a significant change in the actin cytoskeleton organization. 2A. V. Chibalin, A. I. Katz, and A. M. Bertorello, unpublished observations. Thus, endocytosis and phosphorylation of the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit, as well as inhibition of its activity in response to DA (Ref. 22Chibalin A.V. Katz A.I. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1458-C1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and present study), require activation of PKC. It has also been reported that phorbol esters stimulateNa+,K+-ATPase activity (12Carranza M.L. Féraille E. Favre H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C136-C143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Lokhandwala M.F. Cinelli A.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 155: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Cinelli A.R. Lokhandwala M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and that this effect is accompanied by phosphorylation of the α-subunit (12Carranza M.L. Féraille E. Favre H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C136-C143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although both effects (that of DA and of phorbol esters) share a common target, PKC, they are clearly different. For example, stimulation by phorbol esters of Na+,K+-ATPase activity and phosphorylation of the α-subunit were significant after 15 min of incubation (12Carranza M.L. Féraille E. Favre H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C136-C143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the effect of DA occurs already at 1 min, and after 10 min, the α-subunits are no longer phosphorylated and, in addition, they no longer reside in the plasma membrane. Finally, another reason why the effects of phorbol esters and DA are different in nature may be that the effect of DA on Na+,K+-ATPase activity is mediated via a PKC isoform that can be activated by arachidonic acid metabolism and generation (in the PCT) of the cytochrome P-450 metabolite, 20-HETE, an eicosanoid that activates PKC (41Nowicki S. Chen S.L. Aizman O. Cheng X.J. Li D. Nowicki C. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Aperia A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1224-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The action of DA might therefore involve an atypical PKC isoform that is not responsive to phorbol esters (42Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar) but whose activation is rather dependent on membrane lipids. In conclusion, while in intact cells the use of phorbol esters has not been proved to be an efficient probe to demostrate the relationship between phosphorylation of the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit and inhibition of its activity (17Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17726-17733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), by using an agonist such as dopamine in cells where it is produced and exerts its physiologic action it was possible to demonstrate that phosphorylation of the α-subunit is associated with inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity and that this step is required for subunit endocytosis."

In several cell types, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) acutely inhibits NHE3 activity by changes in Vmax, but the mechanism of this inhibition is unknown. We investigated the role of subcellular redistribution of NHE3 in the PMA-induced inhibition of endogenous brush border NHE3 in a model human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, Caco-2. Subcellular localization of NHE3 was examined by confocal morphometric analysis complemented with cell surface biotinylation and compared with NHE3 activity evaluated by fluorometric measurement of intracellular pH. PMA inhibited NHE3 activity by 28% (p < 0.01), which was associated with a decrease of the ratio of the brush border/subapical cytoplasmic compartment of NHE3 from ∼4.3 to ∼2.4. This translocation resulted in 10–15% of the total cell NHE3 being shifted from the brush border pool to the cytoplasmic pool. These effects were mediated by protein kinase C, since they were blocked by the protein kinase C inhibitor H7. We conclude that inhibition of NHE3 by protein kinase C in Caco-2 cells involves redistribution of the exchanger from brush border into a subapical cytoplasmic compartment, and that this mechanism contributes ∼50% to the overall protein kinase C-induced inhibition of the exchanger.

NHE1 is present in nearly all mammalian cells and is involved in regulation of cytoplasmic pH, volume, and perhaps cell proliferation (1Donowitz M. Levine S. Yun C. Brant S. Nath S. Yip J.

In most native mammalian epithelia, NHE1 is found in the basolateral membrane domain. The other well characterized isoform, NHE3, has been found in some segments of small and large intestine and renal tubules, where it has been localized exclusively to the apical membrane domain (3Biemesderfer D.

Physiol. 1996; 33: G29-G41Google Scholar). NHE3 plays a role in net NaCl, HCO3, and probably NH4 reabsorption in renal tubules and in neutral NaCl absorption in the intestine. In dogs, NHE3 accounts for all basal ileal Na+ absorption and the neurohormonal-induced increase in ileal Na+ absorption that occurs after meals (6Yeo C.J. Barry K. Gontarek J.D. Donowitz M. Surgery. 1994; 116: 388-394PubMed Google Scholar, 7Maher M.M. Gontarek J.D. Jimenez R.E. Yeo C.J. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1996; 41: 651-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the rabbit ileal brush border (BB), NHE3 contributes approximately 50% of the basal Na+/H+ exchange, the rest being contributed by NHE2 (8Wormmeester L. Kokke F.T.M. Tse C.M. Kambadur R. Khurana S. Bowser J. Ko W. Cohen M.E. Donowitz M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of NHE1 is generally modulated by changes inK′(H+) (i.e. the exchanger's affinity for intracellular H+ ions) (9Helmle-Kolb C. Counillon L. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. Mrkic B. Murer H.

Growth factors, serum, okadaic acid, and several calmodulin blockers all increaseVmax of NHE3, whereas agents that increase protein kinase C (PKC) activity (phorbol ester, carbachol) decreaseVmax (11Tse C.M.

Since the inhibition occurs via a decrease in Vmax and is observed within minutes, this type of control might theoretically be achieved by a decrease in the number of active molecules at the BB (a redistribution-dependent mechanism and/or rapid degradation), by changes in the turnover number of individual exchanger molecules, or both.

The acute regulation, via growth factors and protein kinases, may be important in rapid adjustments of changing intraluminal sodium concentration in renal tubules and in altering Na+ absorption in the intestine and the kidney. Some evidence indicates that translocation from BB into the cytoplasm might be involved in the short term inhibition of NHE3 in renal proximal tubules, although the specific nature of the cytoplasmic vesicular compartment containing the internalized NHE3 has not been defined (26Hensley C.B. Bradley M.E. Mircheff A.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C637-C645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,27Zhang Y. Mircheff A.K. Hensley C.B. Magyar C.E. Warnock D.G. Chambrey R. Yip K.P. Marsh D.J.

Until now, no results have addressed the possible contribution of the redistribution-based mechanism in the regulation of intestinal NHE3. The results presented in this study indicate that acute inhibition of NHE3 activity by PKC in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 involves redistribution of exchanger molecules from the BB into a subapical cytoplasmic compartment. A comparison of the effect of PMA on NHE3 activity with the exchanger's redistribution suggests that approximately half of the inhibitory effect of PMA is exerted via retrieval of NHE3 molecules from the BB. Human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2, clone PF-11, was characterized previously (28Chantret I. Rodolosse A. Barbat A. Dussaulx E. Brot-Laroche E. Zweibaum A. Rousset M. J. Cell. Sci. 1994; 107: 213-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was recently found to express endogenous NHE3 (29Janecki A.J. Montrose M. Tse M. Zweibaum A. Donowitz M. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: A372Google Scholar). NHE3 is present exclusively at the BB, and its activity peaks at 17–22 days postconfluency. At that time, NHE3 constitutes 85–90% of total BB Na+/H+exchange with only marginal contribution of NHE1. For all experiments described in this report, Caco-2 cells were plated at a density 5–8 × 104 cells/cm2 on a 0.45-μm pore size, HD Falcon PET membranes (Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm pyruvate, penicillin (50 IU/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum, in a 10% CO2humidified incubator at 37 °C. For evaluation of Na+/H+ exchange activity by fluorometry, cells were grown on small fragments of polyethylene terephtalate (PET) membranes glued over apertures in plastic coverslips (“filterslips”) as described previously (30Montrose M.H. Murer H. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 97: 63-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In all experiments, the monolayers were investigated at 17–22 days postconfluency. For functional evaluation of apical (AP) and basolateral (BL) Na+/H+ exchange in Caco-2 cells, intracellular pH (pHi) was measured by a fluorometric method based on cytosolic loading with a pH-sensitive fluorophore, acetoxymethyl ester of 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)5–6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), as described in detail elsewhere (30Montrose M.H. Murer H. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 97: 63-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Watson A.J.M. Levine S. Donowitz M. Montrose M.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G229-G238PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, monolayers grown on filterslips were serum-starved for 8–12 h and incubated with BCECF-AM (5 μm) in the presence of 50 mmNH4Cl (to promote subsequent intracellular acidification) for 50 min at room temperature. Filterslips were then mounted in a cuvette, which enabled separate AP and BL perfusion of the monolayers. The cuvette was inserted into the fluorometer (SPF 500C, SLM, Urbana, IL) and initially superfused at both surfaces with Na+-free buffer (containing 130 mm tetramethylammonium chloride, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm tetramethylammonium phosphate (TMA)2PO4, 25 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Then one surface of the monolayer was exposed to Na+ buffer in which tetramethylammonium chloride was replaced by 130 mm NaCl. Rates of Na+-dependent intracellular alkalinization (efflux of H+, in μm/s) were calculated for a given pHi as the product of ΔpH/ΔT and buffering capacity using the Enzfitter software (Biosoft Corp.) (31Watson A.J.M. Levine S. Donowitz M. Montrose M.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G229-G238PubMed Google Scholar). The buffering capacity of Caco-2 cells was evaluated in a separate series of experiments, as described previously (32Watson A.J. Montrose M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1193: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To differentiate between NHE1 and NHE3 activity at a given monolayer surface we used an inhibitor of Na+/H+ exchange HOE694 (kindly provided by Dr. H. Lang, Hoechst, Germany). The compound'sKi for NHE3 is 650 μm, whereas itsKi for NHE1 (also present in Caco-2 cells) is only 0.15 μm (33Counillon L. Scholz W. Lang H.J. Pouyssegur J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1041-1045PubMed Google Scholar). Complete inhibition of NHE1 without any effect on NHE3 activity is observed with HOE694 concentrations of 10–20 μm (33Counillon L. Scholz W. Lang H.J. Pouyssegur J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1041-1045PubMed Google Scholar, 34Noel J. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 929-939PubMed Google Scholar). In all experiments, 20 μm HOE694 was present in both AP and BL superfusates. Inhibition of NHE2 activity was unnecessary, since the PF-11 clone of Caco-2 cells has no endogenous NHE2 (based on Northern analysis and Western analysis using anti-NHE2 antibody (Ab) 597 (35Tse C.M. Levine S.A. Yun C.H. Khurana S. Donowitz M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12954-12961Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 2C. M. Tse, unpublished observation. In experiments in which the effect of PMA on the Na+/H+ exchange rate was evaluated, phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; 1 μm; Sigma) was added for the last 20 min of incubation with BCECF and was then present in all superfusion buffers (both AP and BL) at the same concentration. In a separate set of experiments, cells were acutely exposed to 1 μm PMA for 5, 10, 20, and 40 min before measuring the rate of intracellular alkalinization in the presence of apical Na+ (130 mm). In all of the above experiments, separate groups of monolayers were exposed to PMA in the presence of the PKC inhibitor H7 (65 μm; Seikagaku Kogyo Co., Tokyo, Japan), which was preceded by 20 min of preincubation with H7 alone. For immunolocalization of NHE3, Caco-2 monolayers were rinsed twice with Dulbecco's PBS and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS, pH 7.4, for 45 min. BB was labeled by incubating the monolayers with FITC-conjugated lectin PHA-E (FITC/PHA; 50 μg/ml; Sigma) for 30 min. Following extensive washing, the permeabilization and blocking of nonspecific binding sites were performed in one step by incubating the monolayers with PBS containing 0.075% saponin, 1% bovine serum albumin (Goldmark Biologicals, Phillipsburg, NJ), and 15% normal goat serum (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) (PBG buffer) for 45 min. Monolayers were then incubated with anti-NHE3 polyclonal Ab 1380 (1:50 dilution) in PBG buffer for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS containing 0.05% saponin and 1% bovine serum albumin. Anti-NHE3 polyclonal Ab 1380 has been previously shown to specifically recognize rabbit NHE3 transfected into PS120 fibroblasts as well as endogenous NHE3 in rabbit and human intestinal epithelia but not to cross-react with NHE1 and NHE2 (5Hoogerwerf W.A. Tsao S.C. Devuyst O. Levine S.A. Yun C.H.C. Yip J.W. Cohen M.E. Wilson P.D. Lazenby A.J. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 33: G29-G41Google Scholar). For control of nonspecific staining, Ab 1380 was substituted with preimmune rabbit serum at 1:50 dilution. Monolayers were subsequently incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:300 dilution; Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) for 45 min, postfixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, and mounted in 50% glycerol in PBS containing 0.2% p-phenylendiamine as an antiphotobleaching agent. In a series of preliminary experiments, we tested the possibility that incomplete penetration of FITC/PHA into the intermicrovillar domains of the BB might affect the calculated intracellular limit of the BB. In these experiments, we labeled the BB from within the cell by fluorescently staining the actin cytoskeleton. Caco-2 monolayers were fixed as described above, permeabilized, and incubated with FITC-conjugated phalloidin (FITC/phalloidin; 0.6 μm; Sigma) for 20 min at room temperature. Monolayers were rinsed twice with PBS, and NHE3 was immunolabeled as described above. The rationale for this approach was based on the fact that nearly all of the actin within the apical zone of polarized absorptive epithelial cells is located within the microvilli, terminal web, and tight junctional complexes. All monolayers were examined in xy and xz planes using a Zeiss LSM410 confocal fluorescence microscope as described below. For morphometric confocal analysis, serum-starved Caco-2 monolayers were exposed to PMA (1 μm) or control medium for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were then cooled rapidly to 4 °C, fixed with cold 3% paraformaldehyde, and stained as above. Using the confocal microscope, serial optical sections were obtained parallel to the monolayer surface (xy plane) at 0.4-μm steps. FITC/PHA and Cy3-labeled NHE3 were excited by separate lasers at 488 nm (argon laser) and 543 nm (HeNe laser), respectively. Emissions from FITC (505–530 nm) and Cy3 (580–660 nm) were collected sequentially (to avoid detection of FITC in the Cy3 channel), and the images were stored on an optical disc. As discussed below, not all cells had adequate Cy3 fluorescence due to heterogeneity of NHE3 expression. Therefore, only cells with significant Cy3 signal (up to 70% of all cells; defined to be adequate when exceeding the average background fluorescence intensity by more than 4 times) were randomly chosen for analysis. Images of these cells were analyzed using MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.) as follows. Four separate areas of 5 × 5 pixels were randomly selected at the surface of each analyzed cell, and pixel density in these areas was determined in consecutive optical sections along the apical-basal (xz) axis of the cell, separately for FITC and Cy3. Obtained values were plotted against the optical section number. The curves obtained for Cy3 (representing distribution of NHE3) were divided into the part overlapping the BB (defined by the distribution of PHA-E; see below) and the part corresponding to the subapical cytoplasmic compartment (SAC). SAC was defined as an apical cytoplasmic area containing Cy3 fluorescent signal and located between the BB and the background fluorescence of the cytoplasm. Finally, the total surface area under the Cy3 curve corresponding to BB plus SAC was calculated (after subtracting the background fluorescence), and the results were expressed as SAC/(BB + SAC) × 100. The obtained values represented the relative amount of immunolabeled NHE3 located in SAC as a percentage of total apical NHE3 amount (BB + SAC) and were, therefore, independent of differences in longitudinal BB dimensions and intensity of Cy3 fluorescence among the cells examined. The apical and intracellular BB limits were defined as the positions at which the BB signal decreased most rapidly during scanning along the apical-basal axis. This was determined using an algorithm to localize the maximum values of the second derivative of the FITC fluorescent signal (BB-bound lectin or, in some experiments, phalloidin-labeled cortical actin) at consecutive optical sections, after smoothing data with the Savitzky-Golay method to decrease random noise (Microcal Origin version 4.1, Microcal Software). The maximum values of the second derivative curve indicated the maximal changes in the slopes of the FITC curve and were assumed to correspond to the apical and intracellular BB limits. Since the definition of intracellular limit of the BB was critical for the subsequent calculations, we used another way to verify the results of the derivative approach. The corresponding FITC/PHA and Cy3/NHE3 curves were normalized to 100% maximal pixel density, and the ratio of FITC versus Cy3 was calculated for each optical section. The point at which the Cy3 values diverged from the intracellular portion of the FITC curve (ratio of Cy3 versus FITC significantly higher than 1.0) was calculated for each cell. This approach determined the point of separation of the NHE3-related signal within the cytoplasm from the BB-defining signal. Reversible surface biotinylation was used to complement the data obtained by confocal analysis, since the results of biotinylation do not rely on calculated limits of the BB. A modification of the procedure described by Le Bivic et al. (37Le Bivic A. Real F.X. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9313-9317Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) was used, with omission of the immunoprecipitation step. Serum-starved Caco-2 monolayers grown on 25-mm Falcon culture inserts were collected and cooled rapidly to 4 °C to inhibit endocytosis (an abbreviated flow chart of the procedure is shown in Fig. 1). The entire subsequent procedure was performed at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. The apical monolayer surface was rinsed with PBS and exposed to Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (0.5 mg/ml; Pierce) in borate buffer (10 mm H3BO3, 154 mm NaCl, 7.2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, pH 9.0) for 1 h, followed by extensive washing. Next, groups of 4–6 monolayers were warmed to 37 °C and incubated in serum-free DMEM containing PMA (1 μm; Fig. 1, group 3) or in DMEM only (control group; Fig. 1, group 4) for 20 min. Separate groups were incubated as above but in the presence of 65 μm H7 (also present during the preceding hour of biotinylation). Monolayers were cooled to 4 °C and exposed to 50 mm glutathione (free acid; Sigma) in 75 mm NaCl supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (pH 9.0) for 40 min, followed by quenching of the free NHS-SS-Biotin with Tris buffer (20 mm Tris, 120 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) for 10 min. In one group of monolayers studied to estimate the total initial amount of biotinylated NHE3 at the BB (Fig. 1, group 1), cells were exposed to control solution lacking glutathione. Also, a separate group was biotinylated and then exposed to glutathione with omission of the step at 37 °C to evaluate the efficiency of the stripping procedure (Fig. 1, group 5). Finally, in a separate group of monolayers a possible loss of surface biotinylated NHE3 during the 20 min of incubation at 37 °C was evaluated (Fig. 1, group 2). If such a loss was significant, it should be taken into account when calculating the amount of NHE3 retrieved from BB during incubation at 37 °C. These monolayers were biotinylated at 4 °C and incubated with 1 μm PMA at 37 °C for 20 min, and the cells were lysed with omission of the glutathione stripping step. The calculated total biotinylated NHE3 (BB + intracellular) was then compared with the initial (i.e. prior to incubation at 37 °C) amount of biotinylated NHE3 at the BB, using Western analysis as described below. All cells were scraped in lysis buffer (60 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 3 μm aprotinin, 20 μmphosphoramidone, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μm leupeptin, pH 7.4), sonicated, and the lysates were incubated for 30 min. Following centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 15 min, the lysates were incubated with avidin-agarose beads (Pierce) for 60 min. The beads were separated by brief centrifugation, and the supernatants were incubated with a second aliquot of avidin-agarose for another hour (to recover any residual biotinylated proteins). The agarose beads (fractions A1 and A2) were washed with lysis buffer and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer for 10 min, followed by brief centrifugation. The biotinylated proteins in the supernatants were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-NHE3 Ab 1380 (1:500). The membrane preparation obtained from PS120 fibroblasts transfected with NHE3 (11Tse C.M. Levine S.A. Yun C.H. Brant S.R. Pouyssegur J. Montrose M.H. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9110-9114Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) was used as an internal standard. NHE3 bands were revealed by incubation of the membranes with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG followed by chemiluminescence detection (Western Blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus, NEN Life Science Products). For quantitation of electroblotted NHE3, the fluorograms were scanned on a Hewlett Packard Scan Jet 4C scanner, and the density of NHE3 bands were analyzed using MetaMorph software and a threshold background subtraction algorithm. Serial dilutions of the biotinylated BB preparation were used to determine whether the analyzed NHE3 band densities were within the linear portion of the concentration curve. To estimate the degree of possible biotinylation of the cytosolic proteins in damaged (“leaky”) cells, cell lysate as well as fractions containing biotinylated BB NHE3 or internalized, biotinylated NHE3 were separated and electroblotted as described above. Nitrocellulose was probed with a general anti-actin monoclonal antibody (A-4700; Sigma), and actin bands were visualized by incubation with donkey anti-mouse IgG followed by chemiluminescence detection. Since actin is an abundant cytosolic protein present within BB, detection of this protein in any of the biotinylated fractions would indicate unintentional biotinylation of cytosolic proteins including NHE3. This would cause an overestimation of the internalized fraction of the exchanger in the subsequent calculations. Numerical data are expressed as means ± S.D., and the significance of difference between experimental groups was analyzed by a two-tailed Student'st test. In control Caco-2 monolayers, the average Na+/H+exchange rate in the presence of 130 mm Na+ (at the AP surface) was 360 ± 55 μm/s (mean ± S.D.; at pHi 6.4) (Table I). Preincubation of monolayers with 1 μm PMA inhibited the NHE3 activity (Fig. 2 and Table I). The maximal effect of PMA was noted at 10 min of exposure and did not change significantly for up to 40 min of incubation with PMA (Fig. 2). At all time points, preincubation of the cells with H7 (65 μm) resulted in a complete reversal of the PMA effect (Fig. 2).Table IComparison of the effect of PMA on the relative distribution of NHE3 between BB and SAC obtained by confocal analysis with the NHE3 activity evaluated by the BCECF fluorometric methodTreatmentConfocal analysis1-2001Values below show the relative distribution of apical NHE (SAC as a percentage of BB + SAC). n = 40 cells.Na+/H+exchange1-bValues below show the H+ efflux rate (μm/s) at pHi = 6.40. n = 12 monolayers.Without H7With H7Without H7With H7%μm/sControl18.7 ± 2.816.8 ± 3.5360 ± 55391 ± 41PMA (1 μm)29.2 ± 3.51-2003Significantly different (p < 0.01) from respective control.,1-dSignificantly different (p < 0.01) from respective value with H7.17.2 ± 2.9259 ± 291-2003Significantly different (p < 0.01) from respective control.,1-dSignificantly different (p < 0.01) from respective value with H7.368 ± 37(12.9%)1-2005Percentage of relative decrease in BB content of NHE3 in PMA-treated cells as compared with control.(28%)1-fPercentage of decrease of Na+/H+ exchange rate in PMA-treated cells as compared with control.1-2001 Values below show the relative distribution of apical NHE (SAC as a percentage of BB + SAC). n = 40 cells.1-b Values below show the H+ efflux rate (μm/s) at pHi = 6.40. n = 12 monolayers.1-2003 Significantly different (p < 0.01) from respective control.1-d Significantly different (p < 0."

Approximately one binding site/subunit of α-crystallin at 25 °C was estimated by equilibrium binding and Scatchard analysis (Kd = 1.1 μm). Based on fluorescence titration, the dissociation constant was 0.95 μm. The number of bis-ANS binding sites nearly doubled upon heat treatment of the protein at 60 °C. Likewise, the exposure of α-crystallin to 2–3m urea resulted in increased binding of bis-ANS. Above 3m urea there was a rapid loss in the fluorescence indicating the loss of interaction between bis-ANS and protein. The α-crystallin refolded from 6 m urea showed tryptophan fluorescence emission similar to the native α-crystallin. However, the refolded α-crystallin showed a 60% increase in bis-ANS binding, suggesting distinct changes on the protein surface resulting from exposure to urea similar to the changes occurring due to heat treatment. The fluorescence of tryptophan in native α-crystallin was quenched by the addition of bis-ANS. The quenching was inversely related to the amount of bis-ANS bound to α-crystallin. Additionally, the binding of bis-ANS reduced the chaperone-like activity of the protein.

Bloemendal H. Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Eye Lens. John Wiley & Sons, New York1981: 1-47Google Scholar). Among the crystallins, α-crystallin is the most abundant protein, existing as a polydisperse aggregate with the average molecular mass of 800 kDa (2Groenen P.J.T.A. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) proteins and enzymes has been demonstrated. Complex formation between α-crystallin and denatured proteins and enzymes or β- and γ-crystallins has been demonstrated (14Rao P.V. Horwitz J. Zigler Jr., J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

On the basis of these in vitro data, it has been proposed that α-crystallin acts as a chaperone in vivo to maintain the lens clarity and that α-crystallin loses this ability during aging. Consistent with this hypothesis, a decreased chaperone-like activity has been observed for the α-crystallin present in high molecular mass aggregates from aged bovine and human lens (29Takemoto L. Boyle D. Curr. Eye Res. 1994; 13: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Rao P.V. Haung Q.-L. Horwitz J. Zigler Jr., J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1245: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that surface hydrophobic sites in the native α-crystallin aggregate are involved in binding of target proteins to α-crystallin during chaperone-like activity display (17Raman B. Rao Ch. M J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A direct correlation between the extent of α-crystallin hydrophobicity and chaperone-like activity has been demonstrated (31Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao Ch. M FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 32Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 33Das B.K. Liang J.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) in their recent study used recombinant αA- and αB-homopolymers and reported that the relative fluorescence enhancement of ANS 1The abbreviations used are: ANS, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid; bis-ANS, 1,1′-bi(4-anilino)naphthalene-5,5′-disulfonic acid; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. is greater with αB compared with αA and concluded that αB has higher hydrophobicity. However, so far the amino acid sequences that contribute to the hydrophobic site(s) have not been identified. In a recent report, Smulders and de Jong (36Smulders R.H.P.H. de Jong W.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) described that the N-terminal domain of recombinant murine αB-crystallin binds hydrophobic probe bis-ANS. We have recently reported that amino acid residues 57–69 and 93–107 of αB-crystallins interact with heat-denaturing alcohol dehydrogenase (37Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kester K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Liang and Li (38Liang J.N. Li X.-Y. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 53: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) reported that there are about 40 ANS binding sites/native α-crystallin. Stevens and Augusteyn (39Stevens A. Augusteyn R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have disputed the study of Liang and Li and reported that there is one ANS binding site/24 subunits of α-crystallins. It is rather difficult to explain the stoichiometry of ANS binding to α-crystallin in view of the proposed complex but ordered structure for α-crystallin (2Groenen P.J.T.A. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In the present study we have determined the binding of bis-ANS to α-crystallin by equilibrium dialysis. The data presented here show the binding of bis-ANS to both A- and B-subunits of α-crystallin and transfer of the energy from protein tryptophan to the bound fluorophore. Furthermore, we show that prior binding of bis-ANS to α-crystallin can affect the chaperone-like activity. bis-ANS was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Junction City, OR). The stock solutions of bis-ANS were prepared in 95% alcohol, and the concentration was determined by absorbance at 385 nm using an extinction coefficient, ε 385 = 16,790 cm−1m−1 (40Sudhakar K. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23015-23021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Ultra pure urea was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. α-Crystallin was isolated from young bovine lens cortex by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 and ion exchange chromatography on trimethylaminoethyl-fractogel column (EM-Separations) as described earlier (21Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10449-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The α-crystallin thus obtained was >99% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and used in this study. Bovine α-crystallin (0.3 μm) was incubated with 0–40 μm bis-ANS in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm NaCl (buffer A) for 1 h at 25 °C. The entire sample was then subjected to equilibrium dialysis in microdialysis cells (Technilab Instruments Inc.) using 1.2-ml volumes of α-crystallin and bis-ANS. Following equilibration for 24 h with stirring, the concentration of bis-ANS in each chamber was measured by its absorbance at 385 nm. The number of bis-ANS binding sites/α-crystallin was determined by Scatchard analysis (41Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were made on a Perkin-Elmer Spectrofluorimeter model 650–40 with a 3600 data station. The concentration of protein used was approximately 0.125 μm. The excitation and emission slit width were set to 4 nm. Samples with bis-ANS were excited at 390 nm, and the emission was measured at 490 nm in a cuvette with a 1-cm path length or recorded between 400 and 600 nm. Briefly, bis-ANS at several fixed concentrations was mixed with α-crystallin, and the fluorescence was measured. All the measurements were made at 25 °C. The fluorescence intensities of the samples were corrected for the absorption of the dye by the relation (42Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983Crossref Google Scholar), Fcorr =Fobs antilog (ODex +ODem/2), where ODex and ODem are the optical densities at excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. To see the effect of urea on bis-ANS binding to α-crystallin, a known amount of protein was mixed with 0–6 m urea in buffer A. After 14 h at 5 °C, bis-ANS was added, and the fluorescence spectra was recorded as above. Blanks without protein were prepared in same buffer. For energy transfer experiments, an excitation wavelength of 295 nm was used to reduce the involvement of tyrosine fluorescence from the protein. The efficiency of energy transfer (EET) (43Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar) from tryptophan to bis-ANS was calculated from the formula,EET = 1 − (Qt/Qo), whereQt and Qo are the relative fluorescence intensities of energy donor (tryptophan) in the presence and the absence of energy acceptor (bis-ANS), respectively. The quenching of tryptophan fluorescence upon the addition of bis-ANS was analyzed according to the equation Fo −F = (Fo −Fi) −Kdapp(Fo −F)/[bis-ANS] (44Kollmann-kock A. Egger H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), where Fo and F denote the observed fluorescence in the absence and the presence of the bis-ANS, respectively, and Fi is the fluorescence at infinite concentration of bis-ANS. A plot ofFo − F versus(Fo − F)/[bis-ANS] yields a straight line whose slope equals Kdappof bis-ANS. α-Crystallin (1 mg) was mixed with 100 μg of bis-ANS in 1 ml of buffer A, and the excess bis-ANS was removed by dialysis using buffer A. After dialysis the sample was taken in a glass Petri dish. The Petri dish was kept on ice, and a hand-held UV lamp (UVL-56 from Ultra-violet Products, Inc., San Gabriel, CA) was placed approximately 2 cm above the sample (45Seale J.W. Martinez J.L. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7443-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The sample was illuminated for 10 min with constant stirring. The sample was analyzed by HPLC and SDS-PAGE after photolysis. The α-crystallin-bis-ANS complex was treated with 5 mmdithiothreitol for 2 h and filtered. The αA- and αB-subunits were separated from one another by HPLC using a C18 column (Vydac C18, 218TP1010 from The Separation Group, Hesparia, CA) and linear gradient formed between 0.065% trifluoroacetic acid in water and 0.065% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. The elution was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. All the fractions were tested for fluorescence (excitation, 350 nm; emission, 450 nm) in a Perkin-Elmer Spectrofluorimeter. The identities of αA- and αB-subunit peaks were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and pooled separately. The fluorescence spectrum of both the αA- and αB-crystallin fractions was obtained (excitation, 390 nm). The capacity of the bis-ANS treated α-crystallin to protect against heat-induced aggregation of ADH was determined according to the procedure described earlier (19Sharma K.K. Ortwerth B.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 61: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, 400 μg of ADH was heated in 50 mm PO4, pH 7.0, and 0.1 mNaCl (buffer A) in the presence or the absence of different amounts of the bis-ANS-α-crystallin in a final volume of 1.0 ml. bis-ANS-α-crystallin was prepared by saturating bis-ANS binding sites in α-crystallin at 48 °C and removing excess bis-ANS by dialysis. The aggregation of proteins at the specified temperature was followed by recording the increase in light scattering as a function of time in a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 3 spectrophotometer equipped with multicell transporter attached to a circulating water bath. bis-ANS is an environment-sensitive probe that shows an emission maximum at 533 nm in aqueous medium (46Shi L. Palleros D.R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7536-7546Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). When bis-ANS binds to a hydrophobic protein such as α-crystallin, its fluorescence intensity increases severalfold, and the emission maxima is blue shifted (32Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Titration of α-crystallin (0.125 μm) with bis-ANS (0–10 μm) gave a hyperbolic plot as shown in Fig. 1, suggesting the saturation of bis-ANS binding sites in α-crystallin. The titration data, when analyzed by a double reciprocal plot (47Wang J.L. Edelman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1185-1191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), gave a Kd value of 0.95 μm for the binding of bis-ANS to α-crystallin. The bis-ANS binding to α-crystallin was also determined by equilibrium dialysis method. α-Crystallin was dialyzed against bis-ANS in buffer A at 4 °C for 24 h following a initial incubation for 1 h at 25 °C. After the dialysis the amount of bis-ANS bound to α-crystallin was estimated on the basis of 385 nm absorption (40Sudhakar K. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23015-23021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) of bis-ANS-α-crystallin complex. Scatchard analysis (41Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar) of bis-ANS bound to different concentrations of α-crystallin is shown in Fig. 2. TheKd and n values calculated from the graph were 1.15 μm and 40, respectively. An average molecular mass of 800 kDa for α-crystallin (2Groenen P.J.T.A. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) was used in these calculations. Earlier reports have shown that interaction of ANS or bis-ANS with α-crystallin is temperature-dependent (31Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao Ch. M FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 32Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 33Das B.K. Liang J.J. Chakrabarti B. Curr. Eye Res. 1997; 16(4): 303-309Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Lee J.-S. Lio J.-H. Wu S.-H. Chiou S.-H. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). When α-crystallin was incubated with excess of bis-ANS at 48 or 70 °C for 1 h and dialyzed to remove the unbound dye, considerably higher amounts of bis-ANS remained bound to α-crystallin compared with bis-ANS-α-crystallin incubated at 25 °C. α-Crystallin incubated at 48 °C was able to bind 80 ± 4 mol of bis-ANS, whereas prior heat treatment of α-crystallin at 70 °C resulted in binding of 110 ± 6 mol of bis-ANS. This translated to 2 and 2.7 binding sites/subunit of α-crystallin at 48 and 70 °C, respectively. The effect of varying concentration of urea on bis-ANS binding to α-crystallin is shown in Fig. 3. Maximum dye binding to α-crystallin was observed in the presence of 3.0 m urea. The increase in bis-ANS fluorescence at low urea concentrations and the sharp decrease in the fluorescence above 3m urea suggest an initial exposure of the buried binding sites at low urea concentration and the destruction of protein quaternary, tertiary, and secondary structures at higher urea concentration. The bis-ANS emission maximum also red shifted in samples with urea (data not shown). Fig. 3 also shows the change in tryptophan emission maximum at various concentrations of urea used. The graph depicts a partial exposure of buried tryptophan fluorescence (maximum emission, 346 nm) at 2.5 m urea concentration, which also showed maximal bis-ANS fluorescence. In another experiment, α-crystallin that had been denatured and unfolded in 6 murea was allowed to refold and renature by dialysis and tested for bis-ANS binding by equilibrium dialysis method at 25 °C. The urea-denatured and renatured α-crystallin and the native α-crystallin, however, showed similar tryptophan emission maxima at 336 nm (data not shown). However, the α-crystallin exposed to urea was found to bind 60% more bis-ANS after refolding compared with the native α-crystallin (Fig. 4).Figure 4bis-ANS interaction with native and urea-denatured and refolded α-crystallin. Experimental details are under “Experimental Procedures.” Broken line, native α-crystallin; solid line, refolded α-crystallin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Energy transfer was detected from the overlap of the tryptophan fluorescence emission spectrum of α-crystallin and excitation spectrum of bis-ANS. The emission spectra of α-crystallin and the α-crystallin-bis-ANS complex when excited at 295 nm are shown in Figs.5 and 6. In the absence of bis-ANS, the fluorescence was emitted maximally at 336 nm due to the excitation of tryptophan residues in α-crystallin. Upon addition of bis-ANS to α-crystallin there was a decrease in the tryptophan fluorescence at 336 nm concurrent with an increase in the fluorescence at 488 nm. Because free bis-ANS does not fluoresce when excited at 295 nm, the 488 nm band represents emission due to tryptophan-excited bis-ANS bound to α-crystallin. The isoemmissive point was 420 nm. A Kd value of 1.4 μmwas obtained for the binding of bis-ANS by the analysis of tryptophan quenching data (44Kollmann-kock A. Egger H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This value is not significantly different from theKd value obtained by equilibrium dialysis method. A similar value was obtained when the tryptophan quenching data were analyzed by a modified Stern-Volmer method (48Eftnik M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar, 49Prasad A.R. Ludeuena R.F. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3536-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The maximum transfer efficiency of 0.9 was obtained when the quenching data were analyzed by the method of Wallach et al. (50Wallach D.F.H. Ferber E. Selin D. Weidekamm E. Fischer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 203: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The transfer efficiency was also calculated by the method described by Stryer (43Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar) and found to be 0.83.Figure 6Concentration dependence of energy transfer between tryptophan and bound bis-ANS. α-Crystallin was excited at 295 nm, and emission was measured at 338 and 490 nm. bis-ANS at 150 μm was added in 15-μl aliquots, and emission was measured after 30 s. Measured fluorescence intensities were corrected for the absorption of bis-ANS at 295, 338, and 490 nm, respectively. ▪, 338 nm fluorescence; •, 490 nm fluorescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effect of prior binding of bis-ANS to α-crystallin on its chaperone-like activity is shown in Fig. 7. Only a marginal decrease in the α-crystallin chaperone-like activity was observed when tested with ADH. It has been shown that bis-ANS can be incorporated to specific hydrophobic sites in proteins by UV activation and that the dye incorporated into the proteins remains sensitive to the polarity of its general environment (45Seale J.W. Martinez J.L. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7443-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that bis-ANS binding sequences in molecular chaperones can be identified by photocross-linking of the dye to the protein, peptide mapping, and sequencing (45Seale J.W. Martinez J.L. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7443-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). During this study bis-ANS was initially allowed to bind to α-crystallin by the addition of saturating amounts of the probe. The excess probe was removed by dialysis. The α-crystallin-bis-ANS complex was photolyzed by UV-A light (366 nm). Fig. 8 shows the SDS-PAGE of the bis-ANS-α-crystallin complex subjected to a 10-min photolysis. The fluorescence seen in the 20-kDa region (Fig. 8, lane 3,left panel) was due to the covalently bound bis-ANS.Lane 2 of Fig. 8 contains the unphotolyzed α-crystallin-bis-ANS complex. The αA- and αB-subunits of photolyzed α-crystallin-bis-ANS complex were separated by HPLC. SDS-PAGE of αA and αB is shown in Fig. 8 (lanes 4 and 5). Both lanes show fluorescence in αA- and αB-crystallin protein band region. These data suggest that both αA- and αB-subunits may be contributing to the bis-ANS binding sites in α-crystallin. Although the presence of surface hydrophobic sites on α-crystallin has been known for a number of years (51Andley U.P. Liang J.N. Chakrabarti B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), only recently has considerable interest been shown in the hydrophobic sites within α-crystallins because these sites have been implicated in chaperone-like function of the protein (17Raman B. Rao Ch. M J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao Ch.

Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 35Sun T.-X. Das B.P. Liang J.N. J. Biol.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). There is, however, disagreement with respect to the number of hydrophobic sites available within α-crystallin as determined by the environment-sensitive probe ANS (38Liang J.N. Li X.-Y. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 53: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 39Stevens A. Augusteyn R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We used bis-ANS instead of ANS to determine the nature of hydrophobic sites in α-crystallin. Consistent with the report published earlier (32Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), our data show that α-crystallin has hydrophobic sites capable of binding environment-sensitive probe bis-ANS. bis-ANS binds to α-crystallin very tenaciously. Unlike ANS-α-crystallin, dialysis of bis-ANS-α-crystallin for 2 days in buffer A did not dissociate the protein bound bis-ANS. We determined the affinity of bis-ANS to α-crystallin by three methods. Although the fluorescence titration method gave a Kd of 0.95 μm (Fig. 1), the equilibrium dialysis method and the tryptophan quenching studies gave Kd and Kdappvalues of 1.15 μm (Fig. 2) and 1.4 μm (Fig. 6), respectively. The difference in dissociation constants determined by the three methods was not significant. These values are five to eight times lower than the Kd value for ANS binding to α-crystallin reported recently (39Stevens A. Augusteyn R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We determined the number of bis-ANS binding sites/subunit of α-crystallin by equilibrium dialysis and measuring the absorbance of bound bis-ANS at 385 nm rather than the fluorescence titration method for the following reasons. The titration method is likely to give incorrect values if all the binding sites are not homogenous. The quantum yield of the dye bound at different sites in subunits may vary significantly. It has also been shown recently that αA- and αB-crystallins have different ANS binding characteristics (35Sun T.-X. Das B.P. Liang J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). From earlier studies we know that there is no constant stoichiometry between the two types of subunits (2Groenen P.J.T.A. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Therefore if we do not know the contribution of each type of binding site to the total sites, a reliable estimate of the total binding sites cannot be made by fluorescence titration studies. In view of this an estimate of binding sites determined earlier by fluorescence titration is likely to include significant error. The equilibrium dialysis method we employed involves the direct estimation of the bound dye on the basis of molar absorbance. The absorbance of bis-ANS is not altered upon binding to proteins. Our estimate of one bis-ANS binding site/α-crystallin subunit at 25 °C is much higher than one ANS binding site/24 subunits estimated by titration method (39Stevens A. Augusteyn R.C. Eur. J.

The estimation of one binding site/24 subunits of α-crystallin cannot be explained by any of the proposed structural models (2Groenen P.J.T.A. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) for the protein. The increase in the bis-ANS binding sites at elevated temperature, the earlier demonstration that α-crystallin displays higher chaperone-like activity if exposed to elevated temperatures (32Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 33Das B.K. Liang J.J. Chakrabarti B. Curr. Eye Res. 1997; 16(4): 303-309Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Lee J.-S. Lio J.-H. Wu S.-H. Chiou S.-H. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the estimated stoichiometry of interactions between the target protein and α-crystallin during chaperoning (18Wang K. Spector A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13601-13608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that one to three hydrophobic sites may be involved in binding a target protein. Although we could not quantify the extent of A- and B-subunit contribution to the total bis-ANS binding sites on α-crystallin, the photocross-linking experiments (Fig. 8) show that both αA- and αB-subunits in α-crystallin bind bis-ANS. By cross-linking studies we have recently shown that both A- and B-subunits of α-crystallin participate in chaperone-like activity display (37Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kester K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As has been reported for rat αB-crystallin (36Smulders R.H.P.H. de Jong W.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), bovine α-crystallin also showed a decrease in chaperone-like activity after complexing with bis-ANS. Although only a partial loss in chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin was observed when it was complexed with bis-ANS (Fig. 7), the data support the hypothesis that hydrophobic sites in αA and αB are involved in chaperone activity. The high residual chaperone-like activity observed for bis-ANS-α-crystallin may be due to the retention of the hydrophobic nature of the site subsequent to the binding of the probe. We have also observed that glycated α-crystallin binds less ANS and displays lower chaperone-like activity. The residual chaperone-like activity of the glycated α-crystallin was directly proportional to the residual ANS binding. 2K. K. Sharma, unpublished data. These data suggest the involvement of same site/amino acid residues in α-crystallin during ANS binding, glycation, and chaperone-like activity. The binding of ANS or bis-ANS to α-crystallin also increases after heat treatment (31Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao Ch. M FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 32Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 33Das B.K. Liang J.J.

Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), partial unfolding by urea (Fig. 3), or urea denaturation and refolding (Fig. 4). Although earlier studies have demonstrated that increased bis-ANS or ANS fluorescence is seen with α-crystallin at 25 °C that has been exposed once to higher temperature (32Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 33Das B.K. Liang J.J. Chakrabarti B. Curr. Eye Res. 1997; 16(4): 303-309Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Lee J.-S. Lio J.-H. Wu S.-H. Chiou S.-H. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), there are no reports on the number of newly formed hydrophobic sites. Our data show that approximately 40 new bis-ANS binding sites are formed per α-crystallin molecule when it is heated to 48 °C. Retention of the additional bis-ANS sites by α-crystallin exposed to at higher temperatures (48 and 72 °C) points to the inability of α-crystallin to regain its native structure after cooling. It is unlikely that in our experiments bis-ANS was trapped in α-crystallin at higher temperature because experiments where bis-ANS was added after cooling α-crystallin also showed increased bis-ANS binding. The increased binding of bis-ANS to urea-denatured and renatured α-crystallin suggests that although the refolded α-crystallin displays intrinsic fluorescence similar to the native protein as reported earlier (52Raman R. Ramakrishna T. Rao Ch. M J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19888-19892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), there is a measurable difference with respect to hydrophobic sites between the native protein and renatured protein (Fig. 4). Therefore caution should be exercised in interpreting the recombinant α-crystallin chaperone-like activity data if the protein isolation step involves urea. The increased binding of bis-ANS to structurally perturbed α-crystallin reported here is similar to that observed with molecular chaperone GroEL (49Prasad A.R. Ludeuena R.F. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3536-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 53Gorovits B.M. Seale J.W. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13928-13933Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 54Horowitz P.M. Hua S. Gibbons D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1535-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but the number of bis-ANS that can bind to native or partially unfolded α-crystallin is greater. Although the oligomeric GroEL (800 kDa), binds one or two bis-ANS molecules in its native form and about 14 bis-ANS molecules in the presence of ∼2.5m urea (54Horowitz P.M. Hua S. Gibbons D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1535-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we estimated that 40 and 65 bis-ANS molecules bind to α-crystallin in its native form and in the presence of 2.5m urea, respectively. The high number of available surface hydrophobic sites are probably responsible for the increased capacity of α-crystallin to bind denaturing proteins compared with GroEL, which is believed to bind one protein at a time (55Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar). The α-crystallin A-subunit has one Trp (Trp-9), whereas the B-subunit has two tryptophans (Trp-9 and 60) (2Groenen P.J.T.A. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The fluorescence emission studies have shown that two tryptophans near the N terminus are relatively buried and the other Trp is near the surface (56Augusteyn R.C. Ghiggino K.P. Putilina T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1162: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The fluorescence quenching studies reported here suggest that the bis-ANS binding sites are relatively closer to the Trp. During our studies to identify the α-crystallin amino acid sequences involved in chaperone-like function, we observed that one of the binding sequences, APSWIDTGLSEMR (37Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kester K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), contained the Trp-60 in αB-crystallin. The sequence is also a hydrophobic sequence predicted by hydropathy plot and deuterium exchange studies (57Smith J.B. Liu Y. Smith D.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore we hypothesize that Trp-60 of αB-crystallin forms the part of chaperone binding site as well as bis-ANS binding site. While this work was in progress, Smulders and de Jong (36Smulders R.H.P.H. de Jong W.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) reported that the bis-ANS binding site is on the N-terminal domain of the recombinant rat αB-crystallin. However, it is not known whether the bis-ANS binding to rat αB-crystallin was influenced by the urea used during the isolation of the recombinant protein. It remains to be determined which amino acid residues form the bis-ANS binding site(s) in native, heat-treated, and refolded α-crystallin. Once the chaperone binding sites are identified in both A- and B-subunits of α-crystallin, the extent of involvement of bis-ANS binding sites in chaperoning can be determined. We thank Dr. B. J. Ortwerth for helpful discussions on this project and critically reading the manuscript."

The first phase is due to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. The second depends on extracellular Ca2+ that regulates cellular effector systems and replenish the stores.

Hydrophobicity analysis shows the existence of seven regions (H1–H7) able to traverse the plasma membrane. We found similarity to Ca2+ channels in regions H6 and H7 and the intervening segment that is thought to contribute to the pore structure (4Phillips A.M. Bull A. Kelly L.E. Neuron. 1992; 8: 631-642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar).The present study addresses the transmembrane topology of one of the Trp proteins, human transient receptor potential 3 (hTrp3), as seen after transient expression in COS cells. hTrp3 is predicted to be a protein of 848 amino acids with the seven hydrophobic regions mentioned above and six endogenous NX(S/T) consensus glycosylation (6Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M.J. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Previous studies from our laboratory in which hTrp3, tagged at the C terminus with the hemagglutinin antigen (HA) epitope, was immunoprecipitated from extracts of metabolically labeled HEK cells and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, showed that hTrp3 migrates as a doublet of ∼97–100 kDa (9Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B. Brown D. Platano D. Sadeghi H. Stefani E. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15195-15202Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Digestion with peptide N glycosidase F (PNGase F) and endoglycosidase H (Endo H) indicated that the upper band of the doublet corresponded to a mature, Endo H-insensitive and endoglycosidase F-sensitive form of hTrp3, whereas the lower band was an immature Endo H-sensitive form (9Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B. Brown D. Platano D. Sadeghi H. Stefani E. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15195-15202Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). A similar experiment in COS cells, showed only the Endo H sensitive form (9Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M.

Below, we identify the location of the glycosylated site. After sequential introduction of consensus glycosylation sites into a Trp from which the endogenous glycosylated site had been removed by site-directed mutagenesis, we then show which of the hydrophobic regions span the membrane and thus form transmembrane segments (TMs). Glycosylation scanning mutagenesis has been used to elucidate topologies of several proteins, including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (10Chang X.B. Hou Y.X. Jensen T.J. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18572-18575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a potassium channel, ROMK1 (11Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Localization of N and C termini on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane allowed us to assign the direction in which the transmembrane segments span the membrane.DISCUSSIONThe results obtained in this study through glycosylation mutants indicate that Trp proteins indeed have six transmembrane segments (Fig. 4), of which the last two are connected by a large loop. Although data to this effect are not yet available, the likelihood of it being the pore is predicated on the sequence homology between TM5–TM6 loops of Trps and the S5 → S6 loops of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (cf. Fig. 5 of Ref.4Phillips A.M. Bull A. Kelly L.E. Neuron. 1992; 8: 631-642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar).Ours are not the first experiments showing glycosylation of a pore region, as the pore region of the ROMK1 K+ channel has been shown to be susceptible to glycosylation when suitably mutated (11Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Once assembled, the pore regions are presumed to be intramembranous. Their susceptibility to glycosylation indicates that the “pores” at one point in time were luminal and suggests that their insertion into the lipid bilayer is a late event in the maturation of the channel. Further experiments in which single amino acids of the putative pore formed by the H6 to H7 linker are changed followed by determination of changes in ion selectivity will be needed to confirm that the linker indeed contributes to the formation of the pore of the channels formed by Trp proteins. The present study identifies on an experimental basis which of the seven hydrophobic domains of Trp proteins traverse the plasma membrane in which direction. Contrary to previous assumptions, the H1 domain is not a TM segment, whereas the much shorter H3 is a TM segment.The delineation of six transmembrane regions formed of hydrophobic regions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 clearly confirms at the topological level the relatedness of Trp channels to other channels formed of units that traverse the membrane six times. In addition by analogy, the data suggest that Trp channels should be tetrameric in nature, as are voltage-gated K+ channels, Ca2+, and Na+ channels, which are concatenated tetramers (18Catterall W.A. Science. 1988; 242: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar).In a recent work the Drosophila Trp and Trp-like have been shown by co-immunoprecipitation to form heteromultimers as well as homomultimers (19Xu X.Z. Li H.S. Guggino W.B. Montell C. Cell. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The production of chimeras between Trp or Trp-like and the Shaker B channel demonstrated that these interactions not only occur in intact cells but may have a functional significance inDrosophila. Formation of heteromultimers between Trp3 and Trp1 was also shown in this study, but no functional data were presented. Although Trp3 and Trp1 are both expressed in the brain, we do not know if hTrp1 and hTrp3 are expressed in the same cells. Further studies will be needed not only to demonstrate that functional multimers of Trp are formed in mammalian cells but also to determine the composition and stoichiometry of these complexes.

Fig. 5 of Ref.4Phillips A.M. Bull A. Kelly L.E. Neuron. 1992; 8: 631-642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar).Ours are not the first experiments showing glycosylation of a pore region, as the pore region of the ROMK1 K+ channel has been shown to be susceptible to glycosylation when suitably mutated (11Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Once assembled, the pore regions are presumed to be intramembranous. Their susceptibility to glycosylation indicates that the “pores” at one point in time were luminal and suggests that their insertion into the lipid bilayer is a late event in the maturation of the channel. Further experiments in which single amino acids of the putative pore formed by the H6 to H7 linker are changed followed by determination of changes in ion selectivity will be needed to confirm that the linker indeed contributes to the formation of the pore of the channels formed by Trp proteins. The present study identifies on an experimental basis which of the seven hydrophobic domains of Trp proteins traverse the plasma membrane in which direction. Contrary to previous assumptions, the H1 domain is not a TM segment, whereas the much shorter H3 is a TM segment.The delineation of six transmembrane regions formed of hydrophobic regions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 clearly confirms at the topological level the relatedness of Trp channels to other channels formed of units that traverse the membrane six times. In addition by analogy, the data suggest that Trp channels should be tetrameric in nature, as are voltage-gated K+ channels, Ca2+, and Na+ channels, which are concatenated tetramers (18Catterall W.A. Science. 1988; 242: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar).In a recent work the Drosophila Trp and Trp-like have been shown by co-immunoprecipitation to form heteromultimers as well as homomultimers (19Xu X.Z. Li H.S. Guggino W.B. Montell C. Cell. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The production of chimeras between Trp or Trp-like and the Shaker B channel demonstrated that these interactions not only occur in intact cells but may have a functional significance inDrosophila. Formation of heteromultimers between Trp3 and Trp1 was also shown in this study, but no functional data were presented. Although Trp3 and Trp1 are both expressed in the brain, we do not know if hTrp1 and hTrp3 are expressed in the same cells. Further studies will be needed not only to demonstrate that functional multimers of Trp are formed in mammalian cells but also to determine the composition and stoichiometry of these complexes.

Sequence analysis revealed that Mtd is a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins containing conserved BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4 regions and a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain. In adult tissues, Mtd mRNA was predominantly detected in the brain, liver, and lymphoid tissues, while in the embryo Mtd mRNA was detected in the liver, thymus, lung, and intestinal epithelium. Expression of Mtd promoted the death of primary sensory neurons, 293T cells and HeLa cells, indicating that Mtd is a proapoptotic protein. Unlike all other known death agonists of the Bcl-2 family, Mtd did not bind significantly to the survival-promoting proteins Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL. Furthermore, apoptosis induced by Mtd was not inhibited by Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL. A Mtd mutant with glutamine substitutions of highly conserved amino acids in the BH3 domain retained its ability to promote apoptosis, further indicating that Mtd does not promote apoptosis by heterodimerizing with Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL. Mtd-induced apoptosis was not blocked by broad range synthetic caspase inhibitors z-VAD-fmk or a viral protein CrmA. Mtd is the first example of a naturally occurring Bcl-2 family member that can activate apoptosis independently of heterodimerization with survival-promoting Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL.

Apoptosis, a morphologically distinguished form of programmed cell death, is critical not only during development and tissue homeostasis but also in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases (1Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6205) Google Scholar). Several regulatory components of the apoptotic pathway have been identified in various living organisms, including man (1Thompson C.B.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). bcl-2, the first member of an evolutionary conserved family of apoptosis regulatory genes, was initially isolated from the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation found in human B-cell follicular lymphomas and was subsequently shown to repress cell death triggered by a diverse array of stimuli (3Vaux D.L.

Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5878) Google Scholar). Several members of the family, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, share conserved regions termed Bcl-2 homology domains 1, 2, 3 and 4 (BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4) and function by repressing apoptosis (for review, see Ref. 7Zha H. Aime-Sempe C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The biochemical process by which Bcl-2 family members regulate cell death are poorly understood. The crystal structures of human and rat Bcl-XLhave revealed a significant similarity to the pore-forming domains of diphtheria toxin and bacterial colicins, suggesting that Bcl-2 family members could function as channels for ions, proteins, or both (8Muchmore S.W.

Experiments with synthetic membranes have shown that recombinant Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bax exhibit ion channel activity, suggesting that Bcl-2-related proteins could regulate apoptosis by regulating trafficking of molecules through intracellular membranes (10Minn A.J.

However, the significance of these latter findings is unclear as there is no evidence that Bcl-2 or related proteins form ion-channelsin vivo. Analyses of the nematode cell death regulators CED-3, CED-4, and CED-9 has provided important insight into the biochemical mechanism that regulates apoptosis. CED-9, the nematode homologue of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, binds to CED-4 and represses cell death by interacting and inhibiting the killing activity of CED-3 through CED-4 (13Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 14Wu D. Wallen H.D. Núñez G.

These studies predict that Bcl-2 and Bcl-XLregulate apoptosis at least in part by interacting with and inhibiting the activation of caspases through the putative mammalian CED-4 counterpart. While proteins like Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL inhibit cell death, structurally related proteins, including Bax, Bak, Bad, Bid, Bik/Nbk, and Hrk activate apoptosis (16Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

In some systems, however, mutants of Bax and Bak can promote apoptosis in the absence of heterodimerization with Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (30Simonian P.L. Grillot D.A.M. Merino R. Nunez G. J. Biol.

Expression of Mtd promotes cell death in rat primary neurons, 293T embryonic kidney cells, and HeLa cells. Unlike other Bcl-2-related proapoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bak, Mtd lacks binding activity to death antagonist Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Furthermore, apoptosis induced by Mtd does not require the conserved BH3 domain and is not inhibited by Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL nor by the broad range synthetic caspase inhibitors z-VAD-fmk and viral protein CrmA. To our knowledge, Mtd is the first example of a naturally occurring Bcl-2 family member that promotes apoptosis in the absence of direct interactions with survival-promoting Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Partial nucleotide sequences of cDNAs homologous to Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 were identified in the expression sequence tag (EST) 1The abbreviations used are: EST, expression sequence tag; HA, hemagglutinin; NGF, nerve growth factor. data base of GenBank™ using TBLASTN (NCBI). The predicted products of four EST cDNA clones 556544, 441963, 402040, and 553421 revealed significant homology to Bcl-XL and Bcl-2. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNAs was determined by dideoxy sequencing. The open reading frame of mouse Mtd was fused at the NH2 terminus with a Flag tag epitope sequence and cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA3-Flag-Mtd. The mammalian expression plasmids SFFV-HA-hBcl-XL, pcDNA3-β-gal, pcDNA-crmA, and pcDNA3-caspase-8-AU1 have been described (15Wu D. Wallen H.D. Inohara N. Nunez G. J. Biol.

Nunez G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The plasmids pGAD10-Mtd and pGAD10-hBcl-2 were generated by fusing the Mtd and Bcl-2 coding regions with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in the yeast pGAD10 vector. Mutations (L71Q/L74Q/L78Q) and Δ91–213 were introduced into the Mtd amino acid sequence by site-directed mutagenesis using a polymerase chain reaction method. The authenticity of all constructs was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. 5 × 106 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids by calcium phosphate method as described previously (23Inohara N. Ding L. Chen S. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). 5 μg of pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-Flag-Mtd was co-transfected with 10 μg of pSFFV-hBcl-2, pSFFV-HA-hBcl-XL, or pSFFV-neo. Total amount of DNA used was always 15 μg. After transfection, 293T cells were harvested at times shown in the figure legends and lysed with 0.2% Nonidet P-40 isotonic lysis buffer (16Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5634) Google Scholar). One mg of soluble protein was incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-Flag polyclonal Ig, monoclonal anti-HA Ig, or control Ig overnight at 4 °C. Tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose 4B (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and washed as described previously (23Inohara N. Ding L. Chen S. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and immunoblotted with anti-Flag, anti-Bcl-2, or anti-HA Ig. Primary cultures of rat sympathetic neurons were prepared from superior cervical ganglia of newborn rats and prepared for microinjection as described (34Gonzalez-Garcia M. Garcia I. Ding L. O'Shea S. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4304-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Individual neurons were injected in the nucleus (DNA solution at 100 ng/ml in 0.1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) with a mechanical Leitz manipulator until slight swelling was observed following a pression pulse of 0.1 atmospheres which took place after 2–4 s. Cell counts were performed 2 h later to determine the number of living cells (usually greater than 85%). Surviving cells were counted at 48 h after microinjection following staining with acridine orange (10 ng/ml). The percentage of microinjected neurons expressing Flag-Mtd was determined at 20 h postinjection in neurons kept in medium with or without NGF. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Neurons were stained with M2 anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (International Biotechnologies), followed by rhodamine-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgG (Boehringer Mannheim). 293T and HeLa cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate methods with 0.2 μg of pcDNA3-β-gal plus 0–1 μg of each pcDNA3-Flag-Mtd plus 0–3 μg of either pSFFV-hBcl-2, pSFFV-HA-h-Bcl-XL, or pSFFV-neo. 20 μmz-VAD-fmk (Enzyme Systems) was added at 8 h after transfection. At 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed and stained for β-galactosidase as described previously (33Inohara N. Koseki T. Hu Y. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10717-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Percentage of apoptotic cells in triplicate cultures was determined by calculating the fraction of membrane blebbed blue cells from the total population of blue cells. In some experiments, cell death was measured by a reduction in the number of cells expressing β-galactosidase relative to that obtained by transfection with the control plasmid. Staining of nuclei with acridine orange and ethidium bromide was performed as described previously (23Inohara N. Ding L. Chen S. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed for DNA fragmentation as described (35Herrmann M. Lorenz H.M. Voll R. Grunke M. Woith W. Kalden J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5506-5507Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Slides containing mouse embryo tissues were prepared as described (36Carrio R. Lopez-Hoyos M. Jimeno J. Benedict M.A. Merino R. Benito A. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Núñez G. Garcia-Porrero J.A. Merino J. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 2133-2142PubMed Google Scholar). Each specimen was hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probe synthesized from a mouse Mtd cDNA template (nucleotides 189–1430) using an in vitro transcription kit (Promega). After washing with 0.2× SSC, samples were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) for 30 min, washed, and developed with alkaline phosphatase substrate. As a control, a sense Mtd RNA labeled probe was synthesized and used for hybridization as above. All slides were mounted with Crystal/mount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA). For Northern blots, a fragment (nucleotides 189–1430) of the Mtd cDNA was radiolabeled by the random priming method using a commercial kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and applied for analysis of human multiple tissue poly(A)+ RNA blots (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To identify novel apoptosis-regulatory proteins, we screened the GenBank™ data base for cDNAs encoding proteins with homology to Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL sequences by using the TBLASTN program. Several ESTs containing overlapping nucleotide sequences with statistically significant amino acid homology to Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL were identified (p = 1.2 × 10−10). The longest cDNA (mouse EST clone 556544) was 1.4 kilobase pairs and analysis of its nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame that encoded a novel protein of 213 amino acids with a predicted relative molecular mass of 23,455 Da (Fig. 1). We designated this gene as mtd aftermatador, a Spanish word for killer (see below). Alignment analysis revealed that Mtd was a Bcl-2-related protein with predicted α1–7 helices (8Muchmore S.W.

In addition to Bcl-2, Mtd showed significant structural and amino acid homology with other Bcl-2 family members such as Bcl-XL, Bcl-w, Bax, Bak, and the Caenorhabditis elegans CED-9 homologue (Fig. 2B).

Hybridization with a Mtd probe revealed a transcript of 2.5 kilobases in several adult tissues but more prominently in liver, brain, appendix, and lymphoid tissues (Fig. 3). Because several EST clones corresponding to Mtd sequences were derived from embryonic tissues, we evaluated the distribution of Mtd mRNA in mouse embryos by in situ hybridization. At stage E15 of development, intense labeling with an antisense Mtd probe was detected in the liver, thymus, lung, intestinal epithelium, and follicles of the whiskers and at a lower level in the developing cortical plate of the brain (Fig. 4, A–C). No significant labeling was detected when the embryonic tissues were hybridized with a sense Mtd control probe (Fig. 4 D). At stage E13 of development, labeling with the Mtd probe was detected in the liver, thymus, lungs, intestinal structures, and intervertebral tissue. 2R. Carrio, J. Merino, and G. Núñez, unpublished results. Thus, the expression of Mtd mRNA in embryonic and adult tissues is highly restricted and differs considerably from that reported for other Bcl-2 family members, including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and A1 (36Carrio R.

Transient transfection of the mtd cDNA into 293T cells induced the expression of a protein with the predicted molecular size of Mtd (Fig. 5 A). Because mtdmRNA was expressed in the brain, we microinjected the Mtd expression plasmid into primary neurons isolated from dorsal root ganglia of neonatal rats. Twenty hours after injection, greater than 80% of the neurons that received DNA containing Flag-Mtd were stained with anti-Flag monoclonal antibody. 3N. Inohara and G. Núñez, unpublished results. In the presence of NGF, 88% ± 8 and 91% ± 5 of the neurons injected with empty vector DNA or with a Bcl-XL-producing vector were viable when the cells were assessed at day 3 postinjection (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, 45% ± 6 of the neurons injected with the Mtd expression plasmid were viable (Fig. 5B, p < 0.01). Within 3 days of NGF deprivation, 30% of the neurons injected with vector alone survived, whereas only 18% of the cells injected with the Mtd expression plasmid were viable (Fig. 5 B, p< 0.01). In control experiments, injection of a Bcl-XLexpression construct rescued neurons from death induced by NGF withdrawal as reported previously (34Gonzalez-Garcia M. Garcia I. Ding L. O'Shea S. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4304-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). To further characterize the proapoptotic activity of Mtd, we transiently transfected the Mtd-producing plasmid into 293T and HeLa carcinoma cells and subsequently observed the cells for features of apoptosis. The Mtd-transfected cells displayed morphological features of adherent cells undergoing apoptosis such as becoming rounded with plasma membrane blebbing, condensed nuclei and detached from the dish. 3N. Inohara and G. Núñez, unpublished results. In addition, Mtd induced nuclear condensation and fragmentation, a feature characteristic of apoptosis (Fig. 6 A). Expression of Mtd induced significant killing activity when compared with control plasmid. At 24 h after transfection, about 25% of 293T cells underwent apoptosis compared with less than 1% with empty plasmid (Fig. 6 B, p < 0.001). Unlike the proapoptotic activity induced by Bax (16Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5634) Google Scholar), the killing promoted by Mtd was not inhibited by co-expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL (Fig. 6 B). In addition, the cell killing activity of caspase-8, but not that of Mtd, was inhibited by the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk or the viral protein CrmA (Fig. 6 B). Expression of Mtd induced oligonucleosomal fragmentation of genomic DNA, which was not inhibited by Bcl-XL (Fig. 6 C). To further verify the proapoptotic activity of Mtd, HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids producing Mtd, Bax, or Bcl-2. Expression of Mtd and Bax killed HeLa cells when compared with empty vector or a plasmid producing Bcl-2 (Fig. 6 D). The conserved BH3 domain of Bax/Bak mediates the binding to Bcl-2/Bcl-XL, and it appears essential for its proapoptotic activity in transient assays (24Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. Lutz R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5589-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 25Han J. Sabbatini P. Perez D. Rao L. Modha D. White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 461-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). To determine if the BH3 domain of Mtd is necessary to induce apoptosis, we engineered a mutant form of Mtd (Mtd.BH3m) in which three critical hydrophobic amino acids (Leu71, Leu74, and Leu78) of the BH3 region were mutated to glutamine residues. These three residues in Bak have been shown to mediate the interaction with Bcl-XL through contacts with residues located in the hydrophobic pocket formed by the BH1/BH2 regions of Bcl-XL (26Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). The ability of Mtd.BH3m to induce apoptosis was similar to that of wild-type Mtd (Fig. 6 B), indicating that a functional BH3 domain is dispensable for Mtd-mediated apoptosis. In contract, a Mtd mutant lacking the BH1, BH2, and COOH-terminal hydrophobic tail domain (Δ91–213) did not induce apoptosis (Fig. 6 B). Western blot analysis showed that both BH3m and Δ91–213 mutants expressed in 293T cells. 3N. Inohara and G. Núñez, unpublished results. We used a two-hybrid assay in yeast to determine the ability of Mtd to interact with Bcl-2 family members. In the two-hybrid assay, Mtd failed to interact with survival-promoting Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL or death-promoting Bax, Bak, and Hrk family members (Fig. 7 A). In control experiments, Bcl-2 interacted with Bcl-XL and itself as it has been reported (Fig. 7 A). To verify these results, we transiently co-transfected 293T cells with expression plasmids producing Flag-tagged Mtd and Bcl-XL. While control experiments showed that Bcl-XL interacts with endogenous Bax, Bcl-XL failed to immunoprecipitate Mtd (Fig. 7 B), in agreement with the two-hybrid results. We conclude that Mtd does not bind significantly to survival-promoting Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL nor proapoptotic Bax, Bak, or Hrk. In addition, Mtd did not homodimerize, assessed by immunoprecipitation and two hybrid analyses. 3N. Inohara and G. Núñez, unpublished results. The results presented indicate that Mtd is a proapoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family. In this respect, Mtd resembles Bax and Bak, two death-promoting Bcl-2 homologues, and Bad, Bid, Hrk, and Bik/Nbk, another set of more distantly related proteins of the Bcl-2 family. Proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family promote apoptosis at least in part by interacting with and inhibiting Bcl-2 and Bcl-XLand presumably other survival-promoting Bcl-2 family members (16Oltvai Z.N.

Mtd lacks the ability to bind to Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and, thus, appears to promote apoptosis in the absence of heterodimerization with these death-repressing molecules. How does Mtd promote apoptosis? There are at least four nonexclusive possibilities. First, it is formally possible that Mtd interacts and antagonizes survival-promoting Bcl-2 family members other than Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. However, a mutant form of Mtd lacking a functional BH3 domain remained active, indicating that it is unlikely that Mtd promotes cell death by binding to and inhibiting survival factors of the Bcl-2 family as the BH3 domain appears to be required for these interactions (23Inohara N. Ding L. Chen S. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 24Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. Lutz R.J.

Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with mutant analysis of Bax or Bak in stable cell lines, which showed that these proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members can promote apoptosis in the absence of heterodimerization with Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL(30Simonian P.L. Grillot D.A.M. Merino R. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22764-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 31Simonian P.L. Grillot D.A.M. Nunez G. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A second possibility is that Mtd antagonizes Bcl-2/Bcl-XL function through competition or sequestration for cellular factors. A potential candidate is a mammalian homologue of the C. elegans CED-4, which regulates caspase activities (15Wu D. Wallen H.D. Inohara N. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21449-21454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that functionally related Bax and Bik/Nbk can displace CED-4 from Bcl-XL (13Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). However it is unlikely that caspases play an important role in the mechanism of apoptosis induced by Mtd, because caspase inhibitors failed to block apoptosis induced by Mtd. The third possibility is that Mtd activates a death pathway distinct from that inhibited by Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Experimental evidence for Bcl-2/Bcl-XL-independent cell death pathways has been revealed in certain cells during CD95- and Bax- induced apoptosis (38Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar,39Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 93: 14559-14563Crossref Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Finally, we cannot exclude that Mtd promotes cell death by mechanisms unrelated to those involving interaction with cellular factors. For example, as it has been suggested for Bax, Mtd could promote apoptosis by forming pores to allow ions or small molecules to cross intracellular membranes (12Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A. Montessuit S. Lewis S. Martinou I. Bernasconi L. Bernard A. Mermod J.J. Mazzei G. Maundrell K. Gambale F. Sadoul R. Martinou J.C. Science. 1997; 277: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Previous work with the proapoptotic Bax suggested that it activates cell death by inducing two separate caspase-dependent and -independent pathways, each of which is sufficient for apoptosis (39Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 93: 14559-14563Crossref Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Similarly Mtd could promote cell death by engaging both caspase-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Because apoptosis induced by Mtd was not inhibited by the broad range synthetic caspase inhibitors z-VAD-fmk or CrmA, the results suggest that apoptosis induced by Mtd is at least in part caspase-independent. While we cannot formally exclude a role for an as yet uncharacterized member of the caspase family that is not subject to inhibition by the broad spectrum inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, the results argue that death agonists like Bax and Mtd can induce cell death by caspase-independent mechanisms. The latter may involve several mechanisms, including alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential and generation of reactive oxygen species (40Reed, J. C. (1997) 387, 773–776.Google Scholar).

Its cyclooxygenase activity catalyzes the incorporation of two molecules of dioxygen into arachidonic acid to form prostaglandin endoperoxide G2, a hydroperoxy endoperoxide (Reaction FR1). The peroxidase activity of PGHS then catalyzes the two-electron reduction of prostaglandin G2 to prostaglandin endoperoxide H2, a hydroxy endoperoxide (ReactionFR2) (1Smith W.L. Dewitt D.L. Adv.

The mechanism of prostaglandin synthesis by PGHS, particularly the relationship between the two activities of this enzyme, has been the subject of intense investigation. The peroxidase and cyclooxygenase activities of PGHS are separate and distinct (4Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). The two active sites are located on opposite sides of the protein and are separated by the heme prosthetic group.

Acta. 1991; 1083: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Despite this spatial separation the peroxidase and cyclooxygenase activities are functionally interconnected.

Scavenging of fatty acid hydroperoxides with glutathione peroxidase inhibits cyclooxygenase activity, and protein or heme modifications that reduce peroxidase activity induce a lag phase in cyclooxygenase activity that can be overcome by addition of hydroperoxide (8Strieder S.

They proposed that ferric PGHS is oxidized by a fatty acid hydroperoxide by two electrons to yield the oxoferryl porphyrin π cation radical intermediate, PGHS compound I (Reaction 3). Compound I oxidizes a tyrosine residue to a tyrosyl radical and is reduced to PGHS compound II (Reaction 4). The tyrosyl radical was postulated to abstract a hydrogen atom from arachidonic acid to initiate the cyclooxygenase cycle (11Karthein R. Dietz R. Ruf H.H. Eur. J.

Tyrosine 385 is present in the cyclooxygenase active site in between the heme group and the putative arachidonic acid binding site. However, reaction of the Y385F mutant with peroxide produces a tyrosyl radical that is qualitatively similar by EPR spectroscopy to the radical produced from wild-type enzyme (14Hsi L.C. Hoganson C.W. Babcock G.T. Garavito R.M. Smith W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Tsai A.-L. Hsi L.C. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5085-5091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Either the spectrally detectable radical in wild-type enzyme is not derived from tyrosine 385 or a different tyrosine is oxidized in the Y385F mutant. Thus, to this point there is no conclusive evidence that the radical signal observed by EPR is that of tyrosine 385, and although it is an attractive hypothesis, there is no direct evidence that tyrosine 385 is oxidized to a radical during PGHS turnover. The apparent limitation of site-directed mutagenesis in combination with EPR for identification of PGHS tyrosyl radicals prompted us to use a different approach to solve this problem. The reaction of tyrosyl radicals with nitric oxide (NO) to form nitrosocyclohexadienone has been demonstrated in other enzymes such as ribonucleotide reductase (16Lepoivre M. Flaman J.M. Bobe P.

It has been shown both in these enzymatic systems as well as with simple phenols that the reaction of NO with phenoxyl radicals to form nitrosocyclohexadienones is reversible (16Lepoivre M.

Van Der Vliet A. Cross C.E. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that NO quenches the PGHS-2 tyrosyl radical signal, but the reaction is irreversible due to the eventual formation of nitrotyrosine (23Gunther M.R. Hsi L.C. Curtis J.F. Gierse J.K. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17086-17090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We have observed that NO quenches the tyrosyl radical signal formed by reaction of PGHS-1 with arachidonic acid. The subsequent oxidation of nitrosocyclohexadienone to nitrotyrosine (presumably by the peroxidase activity of PGHS) provides a potential marker for identification of the modified tyrosine. Thus, using this method in conjunction with peptide mapping techniques, PGHS tyrosyl radicals generated during arachidonic acid oxidation can be identified. Arachidonic acid was purchased from Nu-Chek Prep, Inc. (Elysian, MN). l-1-Tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (type XIII) from bovine pancreas, superoxide dismutase from bovine erythrocytes, tetranitromethane, and hematin were purchased from Sigma. Diethylamine NONOate (DEA/NO) was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI), and proline nonoate (proli/NO) was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). 3-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid was purchased from Aldrich. PGHS from ram seminal vesicles was purified as described previously (24Marnett L.J. Siedlik P.H. Ochs R.C. Pagels W.E. Das M. Honn K.V. Warnock R.H. Tainer B.E. Eling T.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 328-335PubMed Google Scholar). Apo-PGHS was prepared from purified holo-PGHS as described previously (25Odenwaller R. Chen Y.-N.P. Marnett L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Its cyclooxygenase activity was determined by monitoring O2 consumption using a Gilson 6/5 oxygraph equipped with a Clark-type electrode maintained at 37 °C (Gilson Medical Electronics, Inc., Middleton, WI). The specific activity of the apo-PGHS used in these studies was ∼17 μmol of arachidonic acid per mg protein per min. PGHS samples were prepared by reconstitution of apo-PGHS with 1 mol of heme per mol of protein. The resulting stock solution was diluted to a final concentration of 50 μm in 200 μl of 100 mm potassium-phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 25% glycerol. Samples were stored on dry ice until immediately before use. For each experiment, the sample was thawed to −12 °C and placed into 3-mm quartz EPR tubes. Arachidonic acid was added to a final concentration of 1 mm in a volume of 20 μl from a stock solution dissolved in ethanol. When used, the NO generators, Proli/NO or DEA/NO, were dissolved in cold 10 mm NaOH and were allowed to decompose in the PGHS-1 solution for one half-life (2 s in the case of Proli/NO and 180 s in the case of DEA/NO) before the addition of the arachidonic acid. The samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen 5 s after the addition of arachidonic acid and were transferred to a quartz fingertip Dewar that was inserted into a TM110 cavity of a Bruker ESP 300 EPR spectrometer. Spectra were acquired using the following instrument settings: modulation amplitude, 1 G; time constant, 1.3 s; scan time, 1342 s; receiver gain, 1 × 105; microwave power, 2 mW; microwave frequency, 9.49 GHz; modulation frequency, 100 kHz. Due to its rapid decomposition at neutral pH, DEA/NO was chosen as a source of NO. Stock solutions of DEA/NO were prepared using 10 mm NaOH. At this high pH, the DEA/NO was stable for several weeks. Because of the relatively slow decomposition of DEA/NO at pH 8.0, Centricon-10 concentrators (Amicon) were used to change the apo-PGHS-1 buffer from 80 mm Tris (pH 8.0) to phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). PGHS-1 (1.1 mg in 250–400 μl) was placed on the concentrator, and the volume was increased to 2 ml using 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Following a 90-min centrifugation (4000 × g), 1.7 ml phosphate buffer was added, and the samples were centrifuged an additional 60–90 min. Apo-PGHS-1 was reconstituted by adding heme (1 mol/mol PGHS subunit) and incubating at room temperature for 5 min. The PGHS-1·indomethacin complex was generated by adding indomethacin (1.2 mol/mol PGHS subunit) to reconstituted PGHS-1 and incubating at room temperature for 25 min. Generation of NO was accomplished by adding 500 nmol DEA/NO to PGHS-1 or PGHS-1·indomethacin complex and incubating at room temperature for 10 min. 10 eq of arachidonic acid was then added and allowed to react for 3 min at room temperature. The entire reaction volume (400 μl) was then placed on a Bio-Rad 10DG gel filtration column to separate PGHS from the other reagents. The column was equilibrated with 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) and 0.1% Tween 20. The procedure was exactly the same as that described for arachidonic acid above except that 10 eq of CPBA was used in place of arachidonic acid. 3 min after addition of CPBA, the reaction mixture was passed over a 10DG desalting column as described above. The concentration of the CPBA stock solution was determined by spectrophotometrically monitoring the oxidation of ferric horseradish peroxidase to horseradish peroxidase compound I according to the method of Bakovic and Dunford (26Bakovic M. Dunford H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2048-2056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Nitration of PGHS-1 with tetranitromethane was carried out in 80 mmTris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Tween 20. Thus, no buffer change was necessary. The reaction of tetranitromethane with PGHS-1 or PGHS/indomethacin was carried out by adding tetranitromethane (1 mm final concentration, 1.7% ethanol) to 38 μm enzyme and incubating at room temperature for 5 min. Following reaction, PGHS-1 was separated from unreacted tetranitromethane and other small molecules by passing the mixture through a 10DG gel filtration column (Bio-Rad) as described above. Frozen aliquots (20 μl) were thawed quickly and heated with Laemmli reducing sample buffer at 95 °C for 3 min. Samples (1.25 μg) were run on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for 45 min at 160 V then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for 2 h at 70 V. The blot was probed overnight with 2 μg/ml rabbit antinitrotyrosine, polyclonal IgG (Upstate Biotechnology) and 1 h with donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as the secondary antibody. Detection was carried out for 10 s with the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham). Following the desalting procedure, PGHS-1 prepared under a variety of reaction conditions was proteolytically cleaved using TPCK-treated trypsin. To obtain predominantly peptide a (a nitrated PGHS peptide with ∼75 min retention time), a PGHS-1 to trypsin ratio of 50:1 (w/w) was used. The digestion was allowed to incubate for 18 h at 37 °C. To obtain predominantly peptide b (a longer nitrated PGHS peptide with ∼81 min retention time), a PGHS-1 to trypsin ratio of 10:1 (w/w) was used with an incubation of 1.8 h at 37 °C. Digestion was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of glacial acetic acid per ml sample. Each sample was then centrifuged for 5 min, and the resulting peptides were separated by HPLC. PGHS-1 peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC using a Zorbax SBC-18 reversed-phase column (3.0 × 250-mm) (MAC-MOD Analytical, Inc., Chadds Ford, PA) at 0.4 ml/min. Buffer A was water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and buffer B was 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were separated using the following nonlinear gradient: 0–50% buffer B, 0–75 min; 50–75% buffer B 75–100 min; 75–100% buffer B, 100–115 min. Elution of peptides was monitored using a diode array detector. Those peptides containing nitrotyrosine were identified by the unique absorption spectrum of nitrotyrosine at acidic pH (λmax = 360 nm). Peptides containing nitrotyrosine were collected and further purified by HPLC as described below. Nitrotyrosine-containing peptides were further purified by HPLC using a 120-min linear gradient from 40–50% buffer B for peptidea, and 44–54% buffer B for peptide b. Separation was accomplished using the Zorbax SB-C18 reversed-phase column (3.0 × 250-mm) at 0.4 ml/min. The nitrotyrosine-containing peptides (as determined by diode array detection) were collected, and the volume was reduced to 50 μl by lyophilization. These peptides were then submitted for amino acid sequence analysis. All peptide sequencing was carried out by Edman degradation in the Center in Molecular Toxicology Protein Sequencing and Amino Acid Analysis Core Facility. Sequencing was carried out using a Beckman/Porton LF 3400t N-terminal protein sequencer, and HPLC separation of phenylthiohydantoin amino acid derivatives was accomplished using a Beckman System Gold apparatus equipped with a Beckman 168 diode array detector. The reaction of PGHS-1 with arachidonic acid resulted in the formation of a tyrosyl radical as detected by EPR spectroscopy (Fig. 1 A). The detected radical has a line width of 26 G, corresponding to the narrow singlet spectrum previously reported (27DeGray J.A. Lassmann G. Curtis J.F. Kennedy T.A. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23583-23588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radical intermediate persisted for over 1 min at either −12 or 0 °C (data not shown). No tyrosyl radical was detected when the reaction was carried out in the presence of 1 mm proli/NO (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, no tyrosyl radical was detected prior to the addition of arachidonic acid (Fig. 1 C) These data are consistent with results obtained previously with ribonucleotide reductase (17Roy B. Lepoivre M. Henry Y. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5411-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and photosystem II (18Szalai V.A. Brudvig G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 47: 15080-15087Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar,19Sanakis Y. Goussias C. Mason R.P. Petrouleas V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1411-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) in which protein tyrosyl radicals reacted with NO to form nitrosocyclohexadienone and/or nitrite esters. These results are also consistent with those recently obtained by Gunther et al.(23Gunther M.R. Hsi L.C. Curtis J.F. Gierse J.K. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17086-17090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) using PGHS-2. However, unlike the reaction of PGHS-2 with arachidonic acid in the presence of NO, no iminoxyl radical intermediate was detected when PGHS-1 was used in place of PGHS-2. Thus, no evidence was provided by EPR to suggest the subsequent oxidation of nitrosocyclohexadienone to iminoxyl radical. To determine whether nitrotyrosine was formed as a result of the reaction of PGHS-1 with arachidonic acid in the presence of NO, we utilized antinitrotyrosine antibodies in Western blot analysis to probe for nitration of PGHS-1 (Fig. 2). Antinitrotyrosine antibody was observed to bind PGHS following its reaction with arachidonic acid in the presence of NO (lane 3). Both arachidonic acid and NO were required to detect nitrotyrosine (lanes 1 and 2). Superoxide dismutase did not inhibit nitration (lane 4), indicating that peroxynitrite was not the species responsible for the nitration of tyrosine. Much higher concentrations of superoxide dismutase (800 μm/62,500 units/ml) inhibited nitration to a certain extent, but this was due to a nonspecific effect of elevated protein concentration. A similar extent of inhibition was observed with an equivalent concentration of glutathione transferase in the absence of glutathione. Turnover of PGHS was also required to observe nitration of the protein. When PGHS-1 was treated with the inhibitor indomethacin before the addition of DEA/NO and arachidonic acid, no tyrosine nitration was observed (lane 5). The order of addition of arachidonic acid and NO was also important. If arachidonic acid was added 3 min before DEA/NO, no nitration was observed (data not shown). The blot shown in Fig. 2 was also probed with anti-PGHS-1 antibody. As expected, PGHS was detected in all 5 lanes at equal concentrations (data not shown). To obtain more information regarding the number and identity of PGHS tyrosines nitrated by arachidonic acid/NO, we turned to peptide mapping using the unique absorption characteristics of nitrotyrosine as a marker for modified peptides. Tryptic digestion of PGHS-1 prepared by reaction with arachidonic acid/NO produced many peptides as evidenced by the HPLC elution profile observed at 230 nm (Fig. 3 B). Relatively few peaks were detected at 360 nm (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, many of the peaks detected at 360 nm did not have spectra resembling nitrotyrosine. Only two peptides (peptide a and peptide b in Fig. 3 A) had spectra consistent with nitrotyrosine at acidic pH. A typical spectrum of peptide a is shown in Fig. 3(inset). Peptide a was consistently observed under these reaction conditions. Peptide b on the other hand was not consistently detected using these trypsin digestion conditions. The other peptides with absorbance at 360 nm, particularly those eluting after peak b, did not have an absorption maximum at 360 nm, but instead showed a maximum at 400 nm. These data suggested that nitration of PGHS-1 by arachidonic acid/NO occurred predominantly on a single peptide, peptide a. Similar results were obtained when arachidonic acid was replaced by the organic hydroperoxide CPBA (data not shown). Other modifications of the arachidonic acid/NO protocol were also examined. For example, following the addition of arachidonic acid, another 500 nmol of DEA/NO was added followed by an additional 20 eq of arachidonic acid added in two aliquots. In another protocol, phenol (10 enzyme eq) was present as a reducing substrate during the multiple additions of DEA/NO and arachidonic acid. These slight modifications did not affect either the location or extent of PGHS nitration. Consistent with the Western blotting results, both arachidonic acid and NO were required to observe the nitrotyrosine-containing peptide a (Fig. 4). In the absence of DEA/NO, no nitrotyrosine was observed (Fig. 4 B). Similarly, when arachidonic acid was withheld from the reaction very little of this nitrated peptide was detected (Fig. 4 C). It is also important to point out that reversing the order of addition (i.e. arachidonic acid added 3 min before DEA/NO) prevented the appearance of peptide a (data not shown). We observed that in the absence of a peroxidase-reducing substrate, the added amount of arachidonic acid (10 eq) was sufficient to cause irreversible inactivation of PGHS-1. These data suggest that irreversibly inactivated protein is unable to carry out the nitration reaction. It has been shown previously that nitration of three PGHS tyrosines by tetranitromethane (Tyr-355, Tyr-385, and Tyr-417) can be blocked by indomethacin (13Shimokawa T. Kulmacz R.J. Dewitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20073-20076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results with Western blotting showed that tyrosine nitration of PGHS with arachidonic acid and NO was also sensitive to inhibition by indomethacin. Thus, we determined that indomethacin may provide valuable insight to the identity of the nitrated tyrosine observed in peptide a (see Figs.3 A and 4 A). We observed that the reaction of PGHS with arachidonic acid/NO or tetranitromethane resulted in nitration of what appeared to be the same peptide (Fig. 5, A and C). Indeed, when either tetranitromethane or arachidonic acid/NO were used as nitrating agents, indomethacin was able to block the formation of nitrated peptide a (Fig. 5, B and D). To confirm that peak a observed in Fig. 5, A and C, corresponded to the same peptide, the peptide was collected from each separation. These fractions were then rechromatographed separately as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In each case a single peptide with the nitrotyrosine spectrum was observed confirming that in each case one nitrated peptide was produced and collected. The nitrated peptide from each chromatographic reseparation was collected. These peptides were then pooled and rechromatographed using the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” A single peak was observed at 360 nm confirming that the same PGHS-1 peptide was nitrated using either tetranitromethane or arachidonic acid/NO. The ability of indomethacin to block nitration of this peptide by either tetranitromethane or arachidonic acid/NO suggested that tyrosine 355, 385, or 417 was nitrated during PGHS reaction with arachidonic acid in the presence of NO. We also used peptide sequencing to determine the identity of the tyrosine nitrated during PGHS-catalyzed arachidonic acid oxidation in the presence of NO. Early attempts at sequencing were performed on peptides that were not sufficiently purified by HPLC. Consequently, two peptide sequences were obtained. The first started at tyrosine 254 (YQMLNGEVYPPSVEEA), and appeared to be an unnitrated contaminant. Indeed, further purification of peptide a eliminated the appearance of this sequence. The second peptide sequence (MEFNQL) was of greater interest. This second sequence started with methionine 379 and appeared to end with leucine 384. The next amino acid in the sequence should have been tyrosine 385; however, no tyrosine was detected in cycle 7. Instead, a peak that did not correspond to any of the standard 20 amino acids was detected eluting just after diphenylthiourea and just before the phenylthiohydantoin derivative of tryptophan. According to Smith and co-workers (13Shimokawa T. Kulmacz R.J. Dewitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20073-20076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the phenylthiohydantoin derivative of nitrotyrosine should elute at this point in the profile of derivatized amino acids. This suggested that the tyrosine labeled during arachidonic acid oxidation in the presence of NO was tyrosine 385. We also sequenced the nitrated peptide obtained by using the hydroperoxide CPBA in place of arachidonic acid. The same sequence results were obtained. As indicated in Fig. 3, two peptides containing nitrotyrosine were detected, peptides a and b. This suggested the possibility that more than one tyrosine was nitrated during arachidonic acid oxidation in the presence of NO. Therefore, it was important to determine the identity of peptide b; however, peptide b was not consistently observed. By modifying the trypsin digestion protocol (5-fold higher trypsin concentration and 10-fold shorter digestion time), we detected two peaks containing nitrotyrosine (Fig. 6). The first peak appeared to correspond to peptide a observed in Figs.3 A, 4 A, and 5, A and C. The second peptide had a longer retention time (about 81.5 min) and appeared to correspond to peptide b shown in Fig. 3 A. Unlike results obtained with the longer digest protocol, peptide b was consistently observed under these tryptic digest conditions, and roughly twice as much peptide b was produced as peptide a. Peptide b was collected and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” and sequenced. Surprisingly the sequence for peptide b also started with Met-379, and a sequence of MEFNQLYnitHWH (where Ynit is nitrated tyrosine) was obtained for the first 10 amino acids of peptide b. As observed for peptide a, cycle 7 showed no tyrosine as is predicted by the amino acid sequence. Instead, a peak was detected following diphenylthiourea (Fig. 7,panel A). This is the predicted elution time for derivatized nitrotyrosine. Indeed, the spectrum corresponding to this peak was consistent with that of nitrotyrosine (Fig. 7, panel C). This spectrum was only detected for this peak. Spectra collected for diphenylthiourea (cycle 7) and derivatized histidine (cycle 8) do not indicate an absorption maximum at 360 nm. Furthermore, a spectrum collected at the expected retention time for nitrotyrosine in cycle 8 indicates that very little nitrotyrosine was detected after cycle 7. These data confirm that tyrosine 385 of PGHS-1 is nitrated during the oxidation of arachidonic acid in the presence of NO. Ruf and co-workers (11Karthein R. Dietz R. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) proposed 10 years ago that a tyrosyl radical was required for prostaglandin synthesis by PGHS, and since that time, Smith and others (13Shimokawa T. Kulmacz R.J. Dewitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20073-20076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hsi L.C. Hoganson C.W. Babcock G.T. Garavito R.M. Smith W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have shown that tyrosine 385 is essential to the cyclooxygenase activity of PGHS. In light of the ideal position of tyrosine 385 as shown by PGHS crystal structures, many have believed that tyrosine 385 must be the source of the tyrosyl radical observed by EPR and the radical responsible for hydrogen abstraction from arachidonic acid. However, the use of site-directed mutagenesis in conjunction with EPR has failed to produce clear data to support this proposal. Consistent with other tyrosyl radical-containing proteins, the PGHS-1 tyrosyl radical detected during arachidonic acid oxidation is quenched by NO. As with these other proteins, a likely intermediate in the reaction is nitrosocyclohexadienone or a nitrite ester. Our Western blotting and peptide mapping studies both indicate that the nitrosocyclohexadienone adduct is oxidized to form nitrotyrosine. Furthermore, peptide mapping and subsequent amino acid sequence analysis showed that only one tyrosine, tyrosine 385, is nitrated during arachidonic acid oxidation in the presence of NO. Taken together these data provide the first direct evidence to show that tyrosine 385 is oxidized to a free radical intermediate during PGHS catalysis. An alternative mechanism to explain the nitration of PGHS-1 in the presence of NO is coupling to a tyrosyl radical to nitrogen dioxide, (⋅NO2) the product of NO oxidation by molecular oxygen. This reaction would produce nitrotyrosine directly without the intermediacy of a nitrosocyclohexadienone intermediate. Although NO appears to trap all of the spectroscopically detectable tyrosyl radicals as evidenced by their disappearance from the EPR spectrum, recent investigations have shown that NO does not appear to significantly inhibit the rate of arachidonic acid oxygenation by PGHS (28Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar, 29Tsai A.-L. Wei C. Kulmacz R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This suggests that under the conditions employed in the present experiments, NO does not compete effectively with arachidonic acid for the tyrosine 385 radical. Thus, many molecules of arachidonic acid are oxidized on each enzyme molecule before the catalytically active tyrosine 385 radical is trapped by NO. Recent investigations into the effect of NO on arachidonic acid oxidation by PGHS would seem to support such a proposal. It is important to recognize that NO is an efficient reducing substrate for the PGHS peroxidase (29Tsai A.-L. Wei C. Kulmacz R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and as such should greatly stimulate cyclooxygenase activity (2Marnett L.J. Maddipati K.R. Everse J. Everse K. Grisham M. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. I. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 293-334Google Scholar). Contrary to this expectation, NO (added as DEA/NO) has little effect on the initial rate and inhibits by one-third the extent of arachidonic acid oxygenation when compared with a reaction that contains no peroxidase-reducing substrate (29Tsai A.-L. Wei C. Kulmacz R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Moreover, when compared with a reaction containing the peroxidase-reducing substrate aminopyrine, NO inhibits the extent of arachidonic acid oxygenation by ∼65% (29Tsai A.-L. Wei C. Kulmacz R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is possible that the unique inability of NO to stimulate arachidonic acid oxidation commensurate with its efficiency as a reducing substrate stems from its role in nitration of tyrosine 385. Considerable controversy has surrounded the question of whether the tyrosyl radicals detected spectroscopically during PGHS turnover represent catalytic intermediates or inactivated enzyme (14Hsi L.C.

Our finding that NO quenches the tyrosyl radical(s) and produces nitrotyrosine at tyrosine 385 is consistent with the hypothesis that the EPR signal detected during turnover arises from a catalytic intermediate. However, this interpretation must be considered tentative. Our identification of tyrosine 385 as a trapped radical requires that its tyrosyl radical react with NO and that the nitrosocyclohexadienone intermediate be further oxidized to nitrotyrosine. The coupling of NO to protein tyrosyl radicals appears to be completely reversible. Therefore, if the nitrosocyclohexadienone-trapping product from a particular tyrosine was not further oxidized to nitrotyrosine, it would decompose to tyrosine and NO and not be detected by peptide mapping (ReactionsFR5 andFR6).Figure FR6View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Further, any nitrite ester trapping product would not oxidize to nitrotyrosine and would not be detected. Thus, although the present study establishes that tyrosine 385 is oxidized to a radical intermediate during arachidonic acid oxygenation, it does not answer the question of whether the radical signals detected by EPR spectroscopy represent catalytic intermediates or inactivated enzyme. In summary, the nitration of PGHS tyrosine 385 by reaction with arachidonic acid or organic hydroperoxide in the presence of NO appears to result from the reaction of NO with a tyrosyl radical. This provides solid evidence that tyrosine 385 is oxidized to a free radical intermediate during arachidonic acid oxidation. This is consistent with the proposed requirement for a tyrosyl radical in the cyclooxygenase catalytic cycle and previous investigations that have shown tyrosine 385 to be essential to the cyclooxygenase activity of PGHS. The nitration of only one tyrosine is consistent with a role for the tyrosyl radical of tyrosine 385 in cyclooxygenase catalysis but does not prove that tyrosine 385 is the only tyrosine oxidized to a radical intermediate during turnover of the wild-type PGHS. The detection of tyrosyl radicals during the turnover of the PGHS mutant Y385F indicates that other tyrosines can be oxidized in mutant and possibly wild-type enzymes. It will be interesting to determine whether the methodology developed in the present report is useful for the identification of tyrosyl radicals generated from site-directed mutants of PGHS.

Cbl is a prominent PTK substrate suggesting a pivotal role for it in early signal transduction events. However, the regulation of Cbl function and tyrosine phosphorylation in T cells by upstream PTKs remains poorly understood. In the present study, we used genetic and biochemical approaches to demonstrate that Cbl directly interacts with Syk and Fyn via its N-terminal and C-terminal regions, respectively. Tyr-316 of Syk was required for the interaction with Cbl as well as for the maximal tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl. However, both wild-type Syk and Y316F-mutated Syk phosphorylated equally well the C-terminal fragment of Cbl in vivo, suggesting the existence of an alternative, N terminus-independent mechanism for the Syk-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl. This mechanism appears to involve Fyn, since, in addition to its association with the C-terminal region of Cbl, Fyn also associated with Syk and enhanced the Syk-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl. These findings implicate Fyn as an adaptor protein that facilitates the interaction between Syk and Cbl, and suggest that Src and Syk family PTKs coordinately regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl.

Immunity. 1996; 5: 197-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Activation of Lck and/or Fyn leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs present in the intracellular domains of CD3 and ζ subunits, resulting in the subsequent recruitment and activation of Zap-70 and Syk. The activated PTKs in turn propagate activation signals by phosphorylating multiple intracellular proteins, eventually leading to T cell activation, lymphokine production, and proliferation. However, many aspects of the underlying signaling cascades remain unclear. The c-cbl (Casitas B-lineagelymphoma) protooncogene was originally isolated as a cellular homologue of v-cbl, a part of the transforming gene of the Cas NS-1 murine leukemia retrovirus (3Langdon W.Y.

Reconstitution studies in COS-1 cells showed that Zap-70 phosphorylates Cbl in an Lck- and/or Fyn-dependent manner (24Fournel M. Davidson D. Weil R. Veillette A. J. Exp.

Syk has been shown to have a greater intrinsic enzymatic activity than Zap-70 in terms of Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation (25Latour S. Chow L.M.L. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22782-22790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Syk alone can cause tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl, which is enhanced by coexpression of Lck (23Liu Y.-C. Liu Y. Elly C. Yoshida H. Lipkowitz S. Altman A. J. Biol.

The association of Zap-70 with Cbl is activation-dependent, and is mediated by a phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P))-binding (PTB) domain in the N-terminal region of Cbl (30Lupher Jr., M.L. Reedquist K.A. Miyake S. Langdon W.Y. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24063-24068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A point mutation (G306E) in this domain of c-Cbl, which corresponds to a loss-of-function mutation in Sli-1, a Caenorhabditis elegans Cbl homologue (31Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), disrupts the interaction of Cbl with Zap-70, indicating that the N-terminal portion of Cbl is required for the interaction. However, the C-terminal region of Cbl has also been implicated in the constitutive interaction of Cbl with Syk in mast cells (26Ota Y. Beitz L.O. Scharenberg A.M. Donovan J.A. Kinet J.P. Samelson L.E. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The interactions of Syk/Zap-70 and Fyn with Cbl strongly suggest that Cbl is involved in Syk/Zap-70- and/or Fyn-dependent signaling pathways which are stimulated by TCR ligation. However, the regulation of Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation by upstream PTKs remains poorly understood. As a first step toward understanding the biological function of Cbl, we have undertaken a study of the interaction of Cbl with Syk and/or Fyn using genetic and biochemical approaches. We demonstrate that Syk binds to the N terminus of Cbl, whereas Fyn binds to its C terminus. We further define a critical tyrosine residue of Syk, Tyr-316, which is required for the direct interaction with, and for the tyrosine phosphorylation of, Cbl. In addition, our results suggest that Fyn can act as an adaptor protein that facilitates the interaction between Cbl and Syk and the tyrosine phsophorylation of Cbl, suggesting a coordinated regulation of Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation by Src and Syk family PTKs. Polyclonal rabbit anti-Cbl (c-15) and anti-Fyn antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Tyr(P) monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4G10 and anti-glutathioneS-transferase (GST) polyclonal antibody were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-hemagglutinin (HA) mAb (12CA5) was from Boehringer Mannheim. An anti-CD3ε (OKT3) and an anti-HIV-derived tag epitope (H902) (32Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragments of donkey anti-rabbit IgG or sheep anti-mouse IgG were from Amersham Corp. The pLex and pACT2 vectors (CLONTECH) were used in the yeast two-hybrid system. cDNAs corresponding to full-length Cbl, v-Cbl (Cbl residues 1–365), and the C-terminal portion of Cbl (Cbl-C; amino acid residues 450–906) were fused in-frame to the yeast Gal4 activation domain encoded by a pACT2 vector. The pLex vectors containing Zap-70, Syk, or Syk mutants including SykK395R, Y518F/Y519F, 1–298, 1–212, 213–628, Y341F, and Y345F, and the pACT2 vector containing Vav, were described previously (32Deckert M.

Additional Syk point mutations including Y316F or Y500F were made by site-directed mutagenesis based on the pLex-Syk vector. cDNAs encoding wild-type Syk or Syk Y316F were subcloned into a mammalian vector, pEFneo (33Liu Y.-C.

Fyn cDNA in pME18S was provided by T. Kawakami. The Fyn cDNA derived from pME18S was subcloned into pLex in an in-frame fashion. cDNAs encoding HA-tagged wild-type Cbl, 70Z, v-Cbl, Cbl-C, and successive C-terminal deletion mutants of HA-tagged 70Z in pEFneo were reported (34Liu Y.-C. Elly C. Langdon W.Y. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cbl-C and its successive N-terminal deletion mutants constructed by using a polymerase chain reaction were subcloned into pEFneo downstream of an H902 tag epitope (32Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid system used in this study was essentially the same as described previously (32Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Briefly, the yeast strain L40 was cotransformed with pLex and pACT2 vectors containing appropriate cDNAs and cotransformants were first screened on plates containing synthetic dropout (SD) medium lacking Leu and Trp. Colonies were then picked up and grown on plates with SD medium lacking Leu, Trp, and His to examine protein-protein interactions. The transformants were also tested for β-galactosidase activity using a filter assay. Simian virus 40 T antigen (TAg)-transfected human leukemic Jurkat T cells (Jurkat-TAg) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were resuspended (2 × 107/ml) in 0.5 ml of medium, equilibrated at 37 °C for 5 min, and activated with OKT3 (4 μg/ml) for 5 min. Stimulation was terminated by adding 0.5 ml of 2× Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (2% Nonidet P-40, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mmNaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 4 mm Na3VO4, 20 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin). Cells were lysed for 10 min at 4 °C and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g (4 °C for 10 min). COS-1 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For protein expression in Jurkat-TAg and COS-1 cells, cells were transfected with appropriate amount of plasmids (usually 10 μg total) by electroporation as described previously (23Liu Y.-C. Liu Y. Elly C. Yoshida H. Lipkowitz S. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9979-9985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding v-Cbl, or Cbl-C were subcloned into a baculovirus GST fusion vector, pAc-GST (Pharmingen) which, in addition to encoding a GST fusion partner, also encodes a 6× His tag in an in-frame fashion. Recombinant virus carrying these Cbl constructs were generated by cotransfection with wild-type baculovirus DNA into the insect cell line, Sf9, using a Baculogold transfection kit (Pharmingen), were further amplified, and were used for infection of Sf9 cells. The GST-Cbl fusion proteins were then purified by using glutathione or Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity columns. Forin vitro binding assays, cell lysates were incubated with 10 μg of GST fusion proteins for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by adding 40 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads as described previously (35Bonnefoy B.N. Liu Y.-C. von W.M. Sung A. Elly C. Mustelin T. Yoshida H. Ishizaka K. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10142-10146Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). After 1 h at 4 °C, the binding mixtures were washed extensively in 1× Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and used for further analysis. The procedure for Far-Western blotting was described previously (23Liu Y.-C. Liu Y. Elly C. Yoshida H. Lipkowitz S. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9979-9985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The GST-Fyn SH2 fusion protein was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Lysates (1 × 107 cells) were mixed with antibodies for 2 h, followed by addition of 40 μl of protein A/G Plus-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for an additional h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates (IPs) were washed four times with 1× Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and boiled in 30 μl 2× Laemmli's buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 10% gel, analysis and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were immunoblotted with the indicated primary antibodies (usually 1 μg/ml), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Membranes were washed and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Corp.). When necessary, membranes were stripped by incubation in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS for 1 h at 70 °C with constant agitation, washed, and then reprobed with other antibodies as indicated. It was previously reported that Fyn associates with Cbl in T cells, and that this interaction is increased upon T cell activation (28Tsygankov A.Y. Mahajan S. Fincke J.E. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23137-27130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To further define the interaction between Fyn and Cbl, we first used the yeast two-hybrid system. As shown in Fig. 1 A, cells transformed with both full-length Cbl or Cbl-C (and Fyn), but not with v-Cbl, exhibited growth in medium lacking Leu, Trp and His, suggesting that the interaction of Cbl with Fyn is mediated by the C-terminal region of Cbl. As a negative control, no interaction was observed between Fyn and the empty pACT2 vector. Next, we wished to more precisely dissect the Fyn-binding domain in the C-terminal region of Cbl. Two cDNA fragments encoding the proximal (amino acid residues 450–730) or distal (residues 731–906) portions of Cbl-C were subcloned into the pACT2 vector. As shown in Fig. 1 B, similar to full-length Cbl or Cbl-C, yeast transformed with the proximal fragment, but not the distal fragment, of Cbl-C exhibited growth in the selection medium. This result indicates that the region of Cbl encompassing amino acid residues 450–730 contains the binding site(s) for Fyn. To further examine the interaction between Fyn and Cbl, we performedin vitro binding assays using GST-Cbl fusion proteins. Cell lysates from unstimulated Jurkat T cells or from anti-CD3 (OKT3)-stimulated cells were incubated with GST alone, GST-Cbl-C, or GST-v-Cbl. The precipitates were then analyzed with an anti-Fyn antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 A, Cbl-C, but not v-Cbl or GST alone, bound Fyn in an activation-dependent manner (top panel). As a control, the membrane was reprobed with an anti-Grb2 antibody, showing that Cbl-C, but not v-Cbl, constitutively binds Grb2 (bottom panel), as reported earlier (6Donovan J.A. Wange R.L.

Next, we analyzed the Fyn-Cbl interaction in vivo by cotransfecting COS-1 cells with a Fyn plasmid plus a panel of expression vectors encoding HA-tagged C-terminal deletions of Cbl (23Liu Y.-C. Liu Y. Elly C. Yoshida H. Lipkowitz S. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9979-9985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B (top panel), both Cbl-C and full-length Cbl (70Z) coimmunoprecipitated with Fyn (lanes 1 and 6). C-terminal deletion mutants encoding amino acid residues 1–450 or 1–655 did not coimmunoprecipitate with Fyn (lanes 2 and 3). A mutant encoding amino acids 1–698 associated weakly with Fyn (lane 4), and a mutant encoding residues 1–730 of Cbl displayed an even stronger interaction with Fyn (lane 4 versus 5). Equivalent levels of Fyn were present in all the samples as revealed by reprobing the membrane with the anti-Fyn antibody (Fig. 2 B, middle panel). Similarly, the various Cbl mutants were expressed at equivalent levels (Fig. 2 B,bottom panel). To further map the in vivo interaction, we prepared a series of N-terminal deletion mutants derived from Cbl-C. The Fyn-Cbl interaction was then analyzed in COS-1 cells as described above. Cbl mutants encoding amino acid residues 538–906 or 552–906 coimmunoprecipitated with Fyn to a similar degree as did Cbl-C (Fig. 2 C, top panel; lanes 2 and 3 versus lane 1). Deletion of additional 63 (615–906 mutant) or 146 (698–906 mutant) amino acids markedly reduced the interaction of Cbl with Fyn (lanes 4 and 5, respectively). Both the immunoprecipitated Fyn and the expressed Cbl mutants were expressed at similar levels in the different groups as indicated by immunoblotting the membrane with anti-Fyn or H902 antibodies (Fig. 2 C,middle and bottom panels, respectively). These results indicate that the region encompassing amino acid residues 552–614 of Cbl is required for Fyn binding. Syk was recently found to interact with Cbl in rat basophilic leukemia cells (26Ota Y. Beitz L.O. Scharenberg A.M. Donovan J.A. Kinet J.P. Samelson L.E. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and in B cells (27Panchamoorthy G. Fukazawa T. Miyake S. Soltoff S. Reedquist K. Druker B. Shoelson S. Cantley L. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3187-3194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To further define the interaction between Cbl and Syk, we first used the yeast two-hybrid system. As shown in Fig. 3 A, yeast cotransformed with Syk and v-Cbl, but not Cbl or Cbl-C, grew in SD medium lacking Leu, Trp, and His. No interaction was observed between Zap-70 and any of the three Cbl constructs. As a positive control, Syk, but not Zap-70, interacted with Vav (32Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This result indicates that Cbl interacts with Syk in yeast via its N-terminal region. Next, we expanded our studies to map the Cbl-binding site(s) in Syk using the yeast two-hybrid system. As shown in Fig. 3 B, v-Cbl did not interact with the Syk constructs including a kinase-inactive Syk point mutant (K395R), a kinase-deficient deletion mutant that contains the N-terminal tandem SH2 domains (Syk 1–298), Syk Y518F/Y519F in which the two regulatory autophosphorylation sites have been mutated, and Syk 1–212 which lacks the kinase domain and the second SH2 domain. The Syk 213–628 mutant which lacks both SH2 domains but is catalytically active, still associated with v-Cbl. These results indicate that the kinase activity and/or the linker/kinase domains of Syk is required for the interaction with Cbl. Of the four tyrosine-mutated Syk proteins, only the Y316F mutant did not interact with v-Cbl (Fig. 3 B). Of note, the Y341F and Y345F mutations, which mediate the association of Syk with Vav (32Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), or Y500F, had no discernible effect on the interaction with v-Cbl. The specificity of the Y316F mutation is indicated by the finding that it did not disrupt the interaction of Syk with Vav under the same conditions (Fig. 3 C). To establish the physiological relevance of the Cbl-Syk interaction, it was further explored by an in vitro binding assay using GST-Cbl fusion proteins. Jurkat-TAg cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding HA-tagged wild-type or Y316F-mutated Syk. Lysates from unstimulated or anti-CD3-stimulated cells were incubated with GST alone, GST-v-Cbl, or GST-Cbl-C, and the precipitates were probed with an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 A, GST-v-Cbl displayed activation-dependent interaction with wild-type Syk but not with Syk Y316F (lane 6 versus 8). A weak but consistent interaction was observed between GST-Cbl-C and wild-type Syk in OKT3-stimulated cells (lane 10), but not with Syk Y316 (lanes 11 and 12). The expression levels of Syk or Syk Y316F in the lysates were similar as detected by immunoblotting cell lysates with the anti-HA antibody (lanes 13 and 14). This result indicates that Tyr-316 of Syk is required for maximal interaction with Cbl. However, the weak interaction of Cbl-C with Syk suggests an alternative, additional mechanism independent of the Cbl N-terminal domain, which mediates (directly or indirectly) an association between Cbl and Syk. To further analyze the interaction between Syk and Cbl, we cotransfected COS-1 cells with plasmids encoding HA-tagged Syk or Syk Y316F and Cbl. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Cbl antibody and the IPs were analyzed with an anti-Tyr(P) antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 B (top panel), a Cbl-associated phosphoprotein comigrating with authentic Syk was detected in Cbl immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with wild-type Syk (lane 2). A weaker but consistent interaction between Syk Y316F and Cbl was also observed under similar conditions (lane 3). The cell lysates were analyzed in parallel by anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting, showing that similar levels of Syk proteins were expressed (lanes 5 and 6). These results confirm our previous observations indicating that the Tyr-316 in Syk contributes to the in vivo interaction of Syk with Cbl. In addition, the weak interaction between Syk Y316F and Cbl observedin vivo suggests, again, an alternative mechanism for the Syk-Cbl interaction. The interaction of Syk and Fyn with the N- or C-terminal regions of Cbl, respectively, suggested that these two PTKs coordinately regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl. This is consistent with previous studies d"

Because overproduction of NO is known to contribute to several pathophysiological conditions, NOS inhibitors are of interest as potential therapeutic agents. Inhibitors that are potent, mechanism-based, and relatively selective for the NOS isoform causing pathology are of particular interest. In the present studies we report that vinyl-l-NIO (N5-(1-imino-3-butenyl)-l-ornithine;l-VNIO) binds to and inhibits nNOS in competition with l-arginine (Ki = 100 nm); binding is accompanied by a type I optical difference spectrum consistent with binding near the heme cofactor without interaction as a sixth axial heme ligand. Such binding is fully reversible. However, in the presence of NADPH and O2,l-VNIO irreversibly inactivates nNOS (kinact = 0.078 min−1;KI = 90 nm); inactivation is Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent. The cytochromec reduction activity of the enzyme is not affected by such treatment, but the l-arginine-independent NADPH oxidase activity of nNOS is lost in parallel with the overall activity. Spectral analyses establish that the nNOS heme cofactor is lost or modified by l-VNIO-mediated mechanism-based inactivation of the enzyme. The inducible isoform of NOS is not inactivated byl-VNIO, and the endothelial isoform requires 20-fold higher concentrations to attain ∼75% of the rate of inactivation seen with nNOS.

The neuronal (nNOS) and endothelial (eNOS) isoforms are constitutively expressed and are regulated by Ca2+/calmodulin, whereas the activity of the inducible isoform (iNOS) is controlled transcriptionally and is not affected by changes in intracellular Ca2+. Although amino acid sequence homology among the isoforms is limited (∼50%) (3Sessa W.C. J. Vasc. Res. 1994; 31: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), all are comprised of a C-terminal reductase domain that binds NADPH and the cofactors FAD and FMN and a N-terminal oxygenase domain that bindsl-arginine and the heme and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) cofactors (1Griffith O.W.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar), whereas the oxygenase domain is related in function (but not sequence) to the cytochromes P450. Binding of Ca2+/calmodulin to a region between the domains permits electron flow from the reductase domain to the oxygenase domain and also stimulates electron flow within the reductase domain (5Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting reduction of the heme cofactor allows O2 to be activated, permitting the cytochrome P450-like oxidation of l-arginine to Nω-hydroxy-l-arginine and the subsequent further oxidation of that tightly bound intermediate to citrulline and NO (1Griffith O.W.

The solution was then filtered to remove minor impurities and cooled to 0 °C, and the pH was adjusted to 9.5 by addition of cold 10% NaOH. Alkyl or alkenyl imidate (15 mmol), prepared separately from the corresponding nitrile and HCl(g) (43Scannell J.P. Ax H.A. Pruess D.L. Williams T. Demny T.C. Stempel A. J. Antibiot. 1972; 25: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was then added, and the mixture was allowed to stir at pH 9.0–9.5 for 1 h at 0 °C and for 2 h at room temperature. The pH was then adjusted to 7.4 with cold dilute HCl, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. Hydrogen sulfide gas (caution: toxic) was bubbled through the solution, and the resulting copper sulfide precipitate was removed by filtration through charcoal. The filtrate was passed through Chelex to remove any residual Cu2+, and the clear solution was evaporated to dryness by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure. The residue was washed with ethyl acetate, and the product was crystallized from ethanol to give pureN5-(1-iminoalkyl)ornithine orN5-(1-iminoalkenyl)ornithine.N5-(1-Imino-3-butenyl)-l-ornithine (Vinyl-l-NIO, l-VNIO)m.p. 162 °C (dec); 1H NMR (D2O): δ 1.65–2.1 (m, 4H), 3.3 (d, 2H), 3.4(t, 2H), 3.8 (t, 1H), 5.4 (m, 2H), and 5.95 (m, 1H);13C NMR (D2O): δ 25.43, 30.35, 39.37, 44.28, 56.93, 124.16, 131.55, 168.72, and 176.98; FABMS: m/e 200 (M + H).N5-(1-Imino-3-butenyl)-d-ornithine (Vinyl-d-NIO; d-VNIO)m.p. 170 °C (dec), 1H NMR (D2O): δ 1.6–2.1 (m, 4H), 3.3 (d, 2H), 3.4(t, 2H), 3.8 (t, 1H), 5.4 (m, 2H), and 5.89 (m, 1H);13C NMR (D2O): δ 25.43, 30.35, 39.37, 44.27, 56.93, 124.13, 131.55, 168.72, and 176.98; FABMS: m/e 200 (M + H).N5-(1-Iminopropyl)-l-ornithine (Methyl-l-NIO)m.p. 150 °C.

Reaction mixtures contained in a final volume of 50 μl, 50 mmNa+ Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 100 μm EDTA, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 100 μm dithiothreitol, 50 μm BH4, 1.0 μm FAD, 1.0 μm FMN, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 500 μm NADPH,l-[14C]arginine as indicated,l-VNIO as indicated, and nNOS or eNOS. Reaction mixtures for iNOS were similar, but CaCl2 and calmodulin were omitted. Reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme, and the solutions were maintained at 25 °C for 4 min. Reaction mixtures were quenched by the addition of 200 μl of stop buffer containing 100 mm Na+ Hepes buffer, pH 5.5, and 5 mm EGTA. Those samples were heated in a boiling water bath for 1 min, chilled and centrifuged. A portion (225 μl) of the supernatant was applied to small Dowex 50 columns (Na+form, 1 ml resin), and the productl-[14C]citrulline was eluted with 2 ml of water and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting.Optical Difference SpectroscopyStudies were carried out on a Shimadzu model 2501 dual beam UV-visible spectrophotometer using either nNOS as isolated (∼20% low spin heme) or nNOS pretreated with imidazole (100% low spin heme). In the former case, 0.5 ml of nNOS as isolated (432 μg) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm EDTA was placed in the sample and reference cuvettes at 15 °C, and the base-line spectrum was adjusted to zero. Sequential samples of buffer and l-VNIO in buffer were added to the reference and sample cuvettes, respectively, and optical difference spectra at increasing concentrations ofl-VNIO were obtained. Similar studies using imidazole in place of l-VNIO were carried out to determine theKs for that ligand ( KsImid = 86.2 μm, data not shown). The effect of l-VNIO on imidazole liganded nNOS was then determined by initially adding 1.0 mmimidazole to the cuvettes, setting the base line to zero, and then adding sequential samples of buffer and l-VNIO in buffer to the reference and sample cuvettes, respectively, as described above. For these studies KsL-VNIO was calculated from the relationship Ks (app)L-VNIO = KsL-VNIO (1 + [Imid]/ KsImid), where KsL-VNIO is the true binding constant for l-VNIO, Ks (app)L-VNIO is the apparent binding constant for l-VNIO determined in the presence of imidazole, [Imid] is the concentration of imidazole (1.0 mm) and KsImid is the binding constant for imidazole as determined in the preliminary study mentioned (i.e. 86.2 μm).Irreversible Inactivation of NOSTime- and concentration-dependent inactivation kinetics for nNOS and eNOS treated with various inhibitors were determined at 25 °C in reaction mixtures (final volume = 0.15 ml) containing 50 mm Na+ Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1 mmEDTA, 50 μm BH4, 2.0 mmglutathione, 1.0 μm FAD, 1.0 μm FMN, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 units of superoxide dismutase, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 1.0 mm NADPH, l-arginine or inhibitor as indicated, and ∼40 μg NOS. Residual activity was determined after various time intervals by adding a 25-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture to a cuvette containing, in a final volume of 0.5 ml, 50 mmHepes buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μmBH4, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 0.1 mm GSH, 1.0 μm FAD, 1.0 μm FMN, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm NADPH, and 0.25 mm of l-arginine and 5 μm bovine oxyhemoglobin (prepared by reduction with sodium dithionite followed by gel filtration). Reaction mixtures for iNOS were similar but lacked CaCl2 and calmodulin. Nitric oxide-mediated oxidation of oxyhemoglobin was monitored at 401 nm (ε = 0.038 μm−1) (47Feelisch M. Noack E.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 139: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar); the reference cuvette contained a similar mixture without enzyme. The rate of NO formation was determined and used to calculate the residual activity.Determination of Heme LossThe ability of carbon monoxide (CO) to bind to the reduced heme cofactor of NOS and elicit a characteristic absorption maxima at 443 nm was used to determine the loss of heme cofactor after inactivation of nNOS by l-VNIO. The incubation conditions were similar to those used to determine irreversible inactivation except the final volume was 1.8 ml. After specific time intervals (0, 10, and 20 min), an aliquot (200 μl) of the inactivation reaction mixture was added to both sample and reference cuvettes containing 50 mm Na+ Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, and 10% glycerol to give final volume of 0.5 ml. The buffer in the sample cuvette was then saturated with CO, and the difference spectrum between 400 and 500 nm was determined (48Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Determination of NOS-mediated Cytochrome c ReductionReaction mixtures of 500 μl contained 50 mm Na+ Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 100 μm EDTA, 50 μm NADPH, 50 μmbovine heart cytochrome c, and nNOS. NADPH-dependent reduction of cytochrome c was monitored at 550 nm (ε = 0.021 μm−1). Where indicated 10 μml-VNIO, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, and/or 800 units/ml superoxide dismutase were added to the reaction mixtures.Determination of NOS-mediated NADPH OxidationThe rate of NADPH oxidation by NOS was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm with time (ε = 6.22 mm−1). The reaction mixtures contained in a final volume of 0.5 ml 50 mm Na+ Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μm BH4, 2.0 mm GSH, 1.0 μm FAD, 1.0 μmFMN, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 0.25 mm NADPH, where indicated 10 μml-VNIO, and nNOS. NADPH oxidation was initiated by addition of enzyme.DISCUSSIONStudies from this laboratory and others establish that all NOS isoforms bind a variety of l-arginine andl-homoarginine analogs. Initial binding is in all cases competitive with l-arginine, and all of the analogs inhibit all NOS isoforms if added in sufficiently high concentration (1Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Griffith O.W. Gross S.S. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, New York1996: 187-208Google Scholar). Three general mechanisms of inhibition and/or inactivation have been distinguished. Some analogs such as l-canavanine (55Iyengar R. Stuehr D.J. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6369-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar),Nω-cyclopropyl-l-arginine (56Olken N.M. Marletta M.A. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), Nω-nitro-l-arginine with iNOS (57Reif D.W. McCreedy S.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and N5-(1-iminobutyl)-l-ornithine with nNOS (this work) bind to and dissociate from NOS rapidly but do not react covalently; they are classic competitive inhibitors and do not cause inactivation. l-Thiocitrulline is also in this class, although it reversibly interacts to a limited degree (∼20%) as a covalent sixth axial ligand to the heme cofactor (50Frey C. Narayanan K. McMillan K. Spack L. Gross S.S. Masters B.S.S. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26083-26091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). “Slow on-slow off” inhibitors comprise the second type of NOS inhibitors and are exemplified by the slow binding and very slow dissociation ofNω-nitro-l-arginine from nNOS and eNOS (58Klatt P. Schmidt K. Brunner F. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1674-1680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 59Furfine E.S. Harmon M.F. Paith J.E. Garvey E.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). These inhibitors, which include theS-alkyl-l-thiocitrullines (38Narayanan K. Spack L. McMillan K. Kilbourn R.G.

Of these, the best characterized is l-NMA, which has been shown to be hydroxylated by nNOS and iNOS as a pseudosubstrate; that product,Nω-hydroxy-Nω-methyl-l-arginine, undergoes further NOS-mediated reaction to form CH3NO+, formaldehyde, NO, and citrulline by complex mechanisms (53Feldman P.L. Griffith O.W. Hong H. Stuehr D.J. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 54Olken N.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9677-9685Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A presently unidentified intermediate in this latter transformation apparently causes damage to and loss of the NOS heme cofactor, but the product formed is not yet identified (60Olken N.M. Osawa Y. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14784-14791Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Nω-Allyl-l-arginine (56Olken N.M. Marletta M.A. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and Nω-amino-l-arginine (34Wolff D.J. Lubeskie A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have also been previously shown to cause mechanism-based, irreversible inactivation of NOS, and there is a brief report thatl-NIO (35McCall T.B. Feelisch M. Palmer R.M. Moncada S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 102: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) (this work) causes similar inactivation. Inactivation by these compounds has not yet been mechanistically characterized. AlthoughNω-amino-l-arginine causes somewhat more rapid inactivation of nNOS (kinact(max) = 0.35 min−1) (34Wolff D.J. Lubeskie A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), neither it nor the other previously reported mechanism-based arginine analog inactivators shows significant NOS isoform selectivity.The present studies establish that l-VNIO is a potent, mechanism-based NOS inactivator with substantial nNOS selectivity. Thus, initial binding of l-VNIO to nNOS is followed by NADPH- and O2-dependent mechanism-based inactivation of the overall reaction and of the oxygenase domain-dependent NADPH oxidase reactions. The reductase domain-specific cytochrome c reduction activity in the presence or absence of Ca2+/calmodulin is not lost. Consistent with damage to the oxygenase domain, inactivation correlates with loss of the heme cofactor as judged by CO difference spectroscopy. Isoform selectivity derives both from differences in initial binding (i.e. the Ki values for eNOS and iNOS are 120- and 600-fold higher than that for nNOS) and from differences in subsequent enzyme-mediated activation of l-VNIO to a reactive derivative (i.e. iNOS is not subject to mechanism-based inactivation).The"

Using the Cre/loxP system, we developed efficient conditional transgene activation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) cDNA (nucleotides 294–3435) in transgenic mice. Efficient recombination was observed in transgenic mouse liver upon intravenous administration of adenovirus that expresses Cre DNA recombinase. After transgene activation, most hepatocytes were stained with anti-core polyclonal antibody, and 21-, 37-, and 64-kDa proteins were detected by Western blot analysis in liver lysates using anti-core, E1, and E2 monoclonal antibodies, respectively. Serum core protein was detected in transgenic mice 7 days after transgene activation with concurrent increases in serum alanine aminotransferase levels. Subsequently, an anti-core antibody response was detected 14 days after infection. Furthermore, a CD4 and CD8 positive cell depletion assay normalized both the serum alanine aminotransferase increases and pathological changes in the liver. These results suggest that HCV proteins are not directly cytopathic and that the host immune response plays a pivotal role in HCV infection. Thus, this HCV cDNA transgenic mouse provides a powerful tool with which to investigate the immune responses and pathogenesis of HCV infection.

Thus, this HCV cDNA transgenic mouse provides a powerful tool with which to investigate the immune responses and pathogenesis of HCV infection. One desired goal of transgene technology is temporal control of target gene expression in a particular stage of development or in a specific organ. To this end, heavy metal or hormone-inducible or organ specific promoters have been used to generate transgenic animals (1Jaenisch R. Science. 1988; 240: 1468-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). However, the extent and timing of expression of the target gene can only rarely be experimentally manipulated in such animals. Recently, such precise conditional gene manipulation has been possible through the use of a DNA recombination event mediated by Cre recombinase, which catalyzes DNA cleavage between two loxP sequences (2Orban P.C. Chui D. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6861-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). This Cre/loxP system has been used in combination with recombinant adenovirus vector expressing Cre to alter gene expression in the liver of transgenic mice (3Wang Y. Krushel L.A. Edelman G.M. Gene. 1996; 93: 3932-3936Google Scholar). One suitable application of this transgene activation system is the investigation of the functions of viral gene products. When a particular virus of interest has a narrow host range and exhibits limited tissue tropism, it is often difficult to develop a suitable animal model. Temporal control of viral gene expression using a conditional transgene activation system would enable detailed analysis of the immune responses of the host and cytopathic effects of the viral proteins.

Hijikata M. Ootsuyama Y. Nakagawa M. Ohkoshi S. Sugimura T. Shimotohno K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9524-9528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). The coding region encodes structural proteins in its N-terminal portion, which includes a nonglycosylated core protein (p21) that associates with genomic RNA to form the nucleocapsid (5Santolini E. Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3631-3641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immediately downstream from the core are two proteins designated E1 and E2, which correspond to the putative envelope glycoprotein (6Major M.E. Feinstone S.M. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 1527-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). HCV infection is the major cause of post-transfusion non-A non-B hepatitis (7Choo Q.-L. Kuo G. Weiner A.J. Overby L.R. Bradley D.W. Houghton M. Science. 1989; 244: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (6238) Google Scholar, 8Kuo G. Choo Q.-L. Alter H.J. Gitnick G.L. Redeker A.G. Purcell R.H. Miyamura T. Dienstag J.L. Alter M.J. Stevens C.E. Tegtmeier G.E. Bonino F. Colonbo M. Lee W.-S. Kuo C. Berger K. Shuster J.R. Overby L.R. Bradley D.W. Houghton M. Science. 1989; 244: 264-362Crossref Scopus (3051) Google Scholar), and widespread screening for antibodies in blood products intended for transfusion has reduced the risk of fresh infection. Nonetheless, persistent HCV infection often progresses to chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, usually more than a decade after initial infection (9Kiyosawa K. Sodeyama T. Tanaka E. Gibo Y. Yoshizawa K. Nakano Y. Furuta S. Akahane Y. Nishioka K. Purcell R.H. Alter H.J. Hepatology. 1990; 12: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). Thus, the development of adequate treatment and prophylactics for HCV infection has been important. HCV is not infectious in vivo except in primates, a phenomenon that has resulted in the lack of a proper HCV culture system and inbred animal model, which has in turn hampered detailed analysis of viral life cycle and pathogenesis of HCV infection. In the present study we used the Cre/loxP conditional expression system to construct an HCV cDNA transgenic mouse. We confirmed the strong expression of HCV structural proteins in the mouse liver only after transgene activation and subsequent antibody response directed against the transgene product. In addition, over the short, 1-week observation period, HCV structural proteins appeared to have no cytopathic effect on the mice. Thus, this HCV transgenic line should serve as a useful animal model of HCV infection. R6CN2 HCV cDNA (nucleotides 294–3435, numbered according to Chen et al. (10Chen P.-J. Lin M.-H. Tai K.-F. Liu P.-C. Lin C.-J. Chen D.-S. Virology. 1992; 188: 102-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar)) was cloned from the plasma of patient R6, who has chronic active hepatitis. The infectious titer of R6 plasma has been previously determined in chimpanzee and Molt4 cells and has been denoted as plasma K by Dr. Shimizu (11Shimizu Y.K. Purcell R.H. Yoshikura H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6037-6041Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). R6CN2 was determined to be genotype 1b HCV cDNA by sequence homology analysis. pCALNCN2/59–2 is a plasmid that contains the expression-switching transgene unit CALNCN2 (see Fig. 1,Upper), which is similar in design to CALNLZ (12Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Saito I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). CALNCN2 consists of the CAG promoter, a loxP sequence, theneo-resistance gene, the SV40 poly(A) signal, a secondloxP sequence, R6CN2 HCV cDNA, and the globin poly(A) signal, in that order. The CALNCN2 unit was excised from pCALNCN2/59–2 by HindIII digestion and purified by gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. Purified CALNCN2 was microinjected into fertilized BALB/cCrSlc mouse eggs (Japan SLC, Inc., Hamamatsu, Japan). Potential founders were analyzed for the presence of the transgene by polymerase chain reaction of mouse genomic DNA isolated from ear punch specimens using the HCV specific primers: 6-294-S20, 5′-TGATAGGGTGCTTGCGAGTG-3′; and 6-604-R18, 5′-TTGCCATAGAGGGGCCAA-3′. All animal care and experimentation was performed according to the study guidelines established by the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science Subcommittee on laboratory animal care or by Chugai Pharmaceutical's ethics guidelines for animal care, handling, and termination. AxCANCre virus, which expresses Cre DNA recombinase, was generated as described previously (12Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Saito I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). A concentrated and purified virus stock was then prepared, and titers of the purified viral stock were determined as described previously (13Kanegae Y. Makimura M. Saito I. Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. 1994; 47: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice and littermates were used for the in vivo adenovirus infection study. For intravenous injection, the designated titer of purified AxCANCre (0, 0.9, 1.8, 2.7, 3.6, or 5.4 × 109 pfu) diluted in a final volume of 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline was injected into the tail veins of 8–10-week-old male mice. The animals (2 mice/dose) were sacrificed 3 or 7 days after intravenous injection of adenovirus. Genomic DNA from mouse liver, lung, spleen, and kidney was extracted using the Qiagen blood and cell culture DNA kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) for Southern blot analysis. For protein analysis, 100 mg of liver, thymus, heart, lung, spleen, kidney, stomach, intestines, and muscle samples were homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% SDS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). CD4+ and CD8+ T cell depletion was performed by inoculating mice intraperitoneally with 0.5-ml aliquots of a 1 in 10 dilution of mouse ascites fluid containing both the GK1.5 (anti-CD4) and 53–6.72 (anti-CD8, both hybridomas were kindly provided by Dr. S. Koyasu, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan) monoclonal antibodies (14Yang Y. Xiang Z. Ertl H.C.J. Wilson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The monoclonal antibodies were injected 6 days before adenovirus administration and then every 3 days until completion of the experiment. Lymphocytes were prepared from spleen cell suspensions by density separation and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate or phycoerythin-conjugated anti-mouse CD4 and CD8 antibodies (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Stained cells were analyzed using a FACS calibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA). Four μg of genomic DNA was digested by XbaI (Fig. 1), separated by agarose gel electrophoresis on agarose gel, and then transferred to Hybond N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The CALNCN2 unit and R6CN2 HCV cDNA were labeled with digoxigenin using the DIG-High Prime kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and used as the probes in filter hybridization. Aliquots (5 μl) of mouse tissue (thymus, heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, stomach, intestines, and muscle) homogenates and corresponding serial dilutions in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer were directly assayed for HCV core protein as described previously (16Tanaka T. Lau J.Y.N. Mizokami M. Orito E. Tanaka E. Kiyosawa K. Yasui K. Ohta Y. Hasegawa A. Tanaka S. Kohara M. J. Hepatol. 1995; 22: 742-745Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Barba G.

The HCV core protein concentration in the tissue samples was divided by the total protein concentration and expressed as ng/mg of total protein. Liver samples were obtained from the CN2-8 and CN2-29 transgenic mice used for HCV core protein quantification and nontransgenic littermates before and 3 days after injection of 3.6 × 109 pfu AxCANCre. Specimens (approximately 100 mg) were homogenized in 2 ml of cracking buffer (0.25 m sucrose and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2). This homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 7 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of cracking buffer and then homogenized and centrifuged again. Supernatants from the same animals were combined and immediately centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was then ultracentrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in Nonidet P-40 buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) and rocked for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. After the protein concentration in the supernatant was determined as described above, 10 μg of the lysate was separated via 10–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Tris-Tricine buffer and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford MA). The membranes were incubated with biotinylated 5E3 (an anti-HCV core monoclonal antibody (18Kashiwakuma T. Hasegawa A. Kajita T. Tanaka A. Mori H. Ohta Y. Tanaka E. Kiyosawa K. Tanaka T. Tanaka S. Hattori N. Kohara M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 190: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)) or 1864 (an anti-E2 monoclonal antibody) or nonbiotinylated 384 (an anti-E1 monoclonal antibody) followed by horseradish-conjugated streptoavidine or anti-mouse immunoglobulin and visualized using the ECL system (Amersham). Tissue samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Unfixed frozen liver sections were fixed in a 1:1 solution of acetone:methanol at −20 °C for 10 min and then incubated with blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the sections were incubated in the IgG fraction of an anti-HCV core rabbit polyclonal antibody (R355, 100 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the sections were incubated in fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, A, M (Cappel: Durham, NC) diluted 1 in 100 with blocking buffer for 60 min at room temperature and mounted with PermaFluor aqueous mounting medium (Immunon; Pittsburgh, PA). Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity was determined using the Transnase Nissui kit (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., LTD., Tokyo Japan). Transgenic mouse serum (200 μl) was precipitated using polyethylene glycol 4000 and then assayed as described previously (16Tanaka T. Lau J.Y.N. Mizokami M. Orito E. Tanaka E. Kiyosawa K. Yasui K. Ohta Y. Hasegawa A. Tanaka S. Kohara M. J. Hepatol. 1995; 22: 742-745Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Anti-core antibody production in mouse sera was determined using the Immucheck HCV Ab kit (International Reagents Corp., Kobe, Japan). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG, A, M (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) was used as the detection antibody. Sera from mice immunized with recombinant core protein and normal mouse sera were used as the positive and negative controls, respectively. Data represent the mean ± S.D. All statistical analyses were performed using the Student'st test. Statistical significance was established at thep < 0.05 level. Nine animals containing the transgene were identified by polymerase chain reaction screening. To identify the animals capable of expressing HCV protein, spleen cells and fibroblasts were surgically isolated and cultured in vitro. The cultured cells were then infected with AxCANCre at a multiplicity of infection of 100. Two founder lineages, CN2-8 and CN2-29 (official designations BALB/cCrslc-TgN(CALNCN2)1408Rin and BALB/cCrslc-TgN(CALNCN2)1429Rin, respectively) produced HCV core protein, as determined by Western blot analysis, both in their spleen and fibroblast cells (data not shown), and consequently these two lineages were used for further analysis. These mice developed normally and were capable of reproduction. AxCANCre (0, 0.9, 1.8, 2.7, 3.6, or 5.4 × 109 pfu) was infused into 2 mice of each of the CN2-8 and CN2-29 lines/dose by tail vein injection to examine whether Cre-mediated transgene recombination (Fig. 1) had occurred in mouse liver. Three days after the injection of adenovirus, genomic DNA was prepared from liver and analyzed by Southern blot analysis. Transgene recombination occurred in a dose-dependent manner in the livers of the transgenic mice (Fig. 2). Efficient recombination was observed by injection of more than 1.8 × 109 pfu for the CN2-8 mice (Fig. 2 A) and 3.6 × 109 pfu for the CN2-29 mice (Fig. 2 B). When whole CALNCN2 unit was used as the probe, an additional signal at 2.8 kilobase pairs was detected in the CN2-8 genome (Fig. 2 A). This signal disappeared with the CN2 HCV cDNA probe (Fig. 5 B). Thus, this additional signal was a result of the CALNCN2 probe binding to a mouse genomic DNA fragment adjacent to the CAG promoter of the transgene.Figure 5HCV core protein expression and transgene recombination in somatic tissues of AxCANCre-injected mice. A, three animals from both the CN2-8 and CN2-29 lines were administered 3.0 × 109 pfu AxCANCre. Three days after injection, tissues were harvested. The samples were homogenized and used to determine the HCV core protein concentration as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open bars indicate HCV core protein production in the various tissues of the CN2-8 mice.Error bars show standard deviations.

In both lines, the amount of core protein in the liver increased in accordance with the dose of injected adenovirus (0.9 ∼ 5.4 × 109 pfu/mouse). However, similar levels of transgene recombination were observed by Southern blot among the CN2-8 mice that received 1.8 × 109 and more than 1.8 × 109 pfu and between CN2-29 mice that received 3.6 × 109 pfu and more than 3.6 × 109 pfu. Western blot analysis was performed to determine whether HCV protein production was induced by transgene activation and whether these proteins were correctly processed. Liver samples were obtained from CN2-8 and CN2-29 transgenics with or without AxCANCre injection (3.6 × 109 pfu/mouse) or from AxCANCre-injected littermates 3 days after injection. The representative results of one mouse from each mouse group are shown in Fig. 3. Core, E1, and E2 proteins were identified in the total tissue lysates in addition to nonspecific signals (data not shown); however, in the membrane fraction these nonspecific signals were reduced, and the HCV protein signals were clearly visible (Fig. 3). When the 5E3 anti-core monoclonal antibody was used as the probe, core protein (21 kDa) was identified only in the samples from adenovirus-injected transgenic mice and not in the transgenics without adenovirus injection or littermates with adenovirus injection (Fig. 3 A). The HCV envelope glycoproteins E1 (37 kDa) and E2 (64 kDa) were identified only in the samples in which core protein was detected (Fig. 3, B and C). All three HCV proteins were the same sizes in the transgenics and positive controls. The relative production of HCV core E1 and E2 proteins in the liver membrane fractions of CN2-29 mice was 55.7 and 16.9% and 16.8% of CN2-8, respectively, as determined by densitmetric scanning analysis of the films obtained in Western blot (Fig. 3). Immunofluorescence staining confirmed HCV core protein expression in AxCANCre-injected CN2 transgenic mouse liver (Fig. 4). Core protein staining was negative in liver sections from transgenics without AxCANCre injection or AxCANCre-injected littermates (Fig. 4, A, D, and G). On the other hand, core protein staining was clearly evident in most of the hepatocytes in the lobule of the liver section of AxCANCre-infused CN2-8 mice (Fig. 4, B and C). In the case of CN2-29 mice with adenovirus injection, approximately 20% of hepatocytes stained clearly, whereas the remaining 80% stained only faintly or uncertainly (Fig. 4, E and F). In both lines, core protein staining in the cytoplasm was diffuse and punctate, whereas no staining in the nuclei was observed (Fig. 4,C and F). Three animals of both the CN2-8 and CN2-29 lineages were inoculated with 3.0 × 109 pfu AxCANCre/mouse via tail vein injection and sacrificed 3 days later. Tissue samples were harvested and homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer for HCV core protein quantification. Genomic DNA were also extracted for Southern blot analysis. Fig. 5 A illustrates that core protein expression was predominant in the liver compared with other tissues, particularly in the CN2-8 lineage. The level of core protein production in the CN2-8 and CN2-29 lineages was essentially identical in the lung and spleen (2.6 ± 0.5 versus 2.9 ± 0.5 ng/mg and 6.0 ± 0.7 versus 5.5 ± 1.4 ng/mg, respectively), whereas it differed significantly in the liver (71.9 ± 4.9 ng/mg versus 6.6 ± 5.6 ng/mg,p < 0.0005). HCV core protein was barely detected in the thymus, kidney, stomach, intestines, and muscle. Southern blot analysis using genomic DNA from the same tissue samples (Fig. 5 B) revealed that, as expected (3Wang Y. Krushel L.A. Edelman G.M. Gene. 1996; 93: 3932-3936Google Scholar), transgene recombination occurred only in the liver in both lines. Quantification of HCV core protein in 200 μl of mouse serum was performed according to the method used for HCV-infected human patient sera (16Tanaka T. Lau J.Y.N. Mizokami M. Orito E. Tanaka E. Kiyosawa K. Yasui K. Ohta Y. Hasegawa A. Tanaka S. Kohara M. J. Hepatol. 1995; 22: 742-745Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Seven days after injection of 3.6 × 109 pfu AxCANCre into three CN2-8 transgenics, the serum HCV core protein level was determined to be 152.9 ± 129.5 pg/ml (Table I). Recombinant defective adenovirus itself induces considerable liver injury that is dependent on the presence of both CD4+ and CD8+ cells (15Yang Y. Wilson J.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2564-2570PubMed Google Scholar, 19Yang Y. Ertl H.C.J. Wilson J.M. Immunity. 1994; 1: 433-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The serum ALT level of these three CN2-8 mice was 2605.4 ± 704.9 Karmen units/liter. At the same time, CD4+ and CD8+ cells were depleted in three CN2-8 mice, which were then injected with 3.6 × 109 pfu AxCANCre. Seven days after adenovirus injection, the serum ALT levels and the presence of circulating HCV core protein were determined, and splenic lymphocyte subpopulations were analyzed. As shown in Table I, the levels of circulating core protein in CN2-8 mice was primarily dependent on hepatocyte destruction.Table ISerum ALT levels and HCV core protein production in CN2–8 transgenic miceNumber of miceAnti-CD4 and anti-CD8 injectionSpleen cell populationSerum ALT levelSerum HCV core proteinCD4+ cellCD8+cell%Karmen units/literpg/ml3Not received20.5 ± 3.71-2001All values express mean ± S.D.9.1 ± 3.52605.4 ± 704.9152.9 ± 129.53Received1.7 ± 2.81-bSignificantly different compared with mice that did not receive CD4 and CD8 depletion (P < 0.05).0.5 ± 0.178.1 ± 37.11-bSignificantly different compared with mice that did not receive CD4 and CD8 depletion (P < 0.05).<8.01-2003Below detection limit of the assay.1-2001 All values express mean ± S.D.1-b Significantly different compared with mice that did not receive CD4 and CD8 depletion (P < 0.05).1-2003 Below detection limit of the assay. Open table in a new tab Fourteen days after AxCANCre injection, serum samples were collected from CN2-8 and CN2-29 transgenics and littermates, and anti-core antibody titers were determined by the enzyme immunoassay method. CN2-8 mice had significantly higher anti-core antibody titers than the CN2-29 mice or the littermates (Table II). One of the four other CN2-8 mice also infected with AxCANCre developed a positive antibody titer even at a 1 in 10,000 serum dilution 28 days after adenovirus injection, and two of four other CN2-29 mice also seroconverted 28 days after AxCANCre injection.Table IISerum anti-HCV core protein production 14 days after AxCANCre administrationType of mouse (n)Anti-HCV core (A490)CN2–8 (6)0.182 ± 0.1272-2001Significantly different compared with CN2–29 and littermates (P < 0.05).CN2–29 (6)0.024 ± 0.054Littermate (6)0.028 ± 0.0292-2001 Significantly different compared with CN2–29 and littermates (P < 0.05). Open table in a new tab Analysis of liver tissue 7 days after adenovirus administration revealed the development of substantial hepatic pathology in CN2-8 mice (Fig. 6 C) that was not present in naive CN2-8 mice (Fig. 6 A) or CD4+ and CD8+ cell-depleted CN2-8 mice (Fig. 6 B). Recent advances in molecular biology have enabled examination of the function of genes of interest by raising stable cell lines or transgenic animals with consistent gene expression. However, if the transgene is harmful or disadvantageous for cell growth or embryogenesis, the resultant cell lines or animals may be already genetically changed to tolerate the effects of the transgene products. These problems may be avoided using the Cre/loxP-mediated conditional expression system, which has already been successfully applied to mammalian cells, transgenic animals, and gene targeting. Another advantage of this system is that the transgenic animal is immunocompetent for the transgene product, which is extremely useful for examining immunological reactions against transgene products such as infectious agents. Since HCV infects immunocompetent adults and causes persistent infection, this system may allow for the development of a disease model. We obtained two founder transgenic lines, CN2-8 and CN2-29, using the CALNCN2 unit. In the absence of Cre recombinase, no HCV gene expression was observed in either line. In addition, their growth and liver histology did not differ from normal BALB/c mice (data not shown). Injection of the recombinant adenovirus AxCANCre, which express Cre recombinase in the cells or tissues it infects, resulted in HCV gene expression activation predominantly in the mouse liver in a dose-dependent manner. Efficient transgene recombination was confirmed in the both lines by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 2). Normal-sized HCV structural proteins were expressed as determined by Western blot (Fig. 3). Immunostaining revealed that most of the hepatocytes were expressing HCV core protein in CN2-8 mouse liver (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the level of core protein expression in the liver and spleen of the CN2-29 line was almost identical, whereas transgene recombination was complete in the liver but hardly detected in the spleen (Fig. 5). This suggests that the tissue distribution of HCV proteins in CN2-29 transgenic mice is dependent not only on the tissue tropism of recombinant adenovirus infection (3Wang Y. Krushel L.A. Edelman G.M. Gene. 1996; 93: 3932-3936Google Scholar, 19Yang Y. Ertl H.C.J. Wilson J.M. Immunity. 1994; 1: 433-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) but also on the site of transgene integration into the mouse genome. These results also indicate that transgene recombination is well controlled by AxCANCre infection in these mice and that the level and sites of induced HCV protein expression depend on lineage differences. The difference in HCV expression in the liver between the CN2-8 and CN2-29 mice may be the result of the transgene being under the control of tissue-specific negative control elements in CN2-29 mice. The diffuse and punctate cytoplasmic staining pattern of core protein observed in the CN2-8 and CN2-29 transgenic mice is similar to that seen in a mammalian cell culture expression system and primate liver specimens (20Moradpour D. Englert C. Wakita T. Wands J.R. Virology. 1996; 222: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 21Moradpour D. Wakita T. Tokushige K. Carlson R.I. Krawczynski K. Wands J.R. J. Med. Virol. 1996; 48: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Punctate and vesicular staining has been reported in HCV cDNA-transfected mammalian cells, and immunoelectron microscopy has revealed that core protein surrounds lipid droplets in the cytoplasm (17Barba G. Harper F. Harada T. Kohara M. Goulinet S. Matsuura Y. Eder G. Schaff Zs. Chapman M.J. Miyamura T. Brechot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1200-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 20Moradpour D. Englert C. Wakita T. Wands J.R. Virology. 1996; 222: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In the present study, core protein staining was observed only in the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus. On the other hand, the nuclear localization of HCV core protein and its suppression of HBV replication has been reported (22Shih C.-M. Lo S.J. Miyamura T. Chen S.-Y. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5823-5832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, future research will need to clarify whether HCV core protein exists in the nucleus and plays a role in the natural HCV life cycle. In the present study, the E1 and E2 proteins, which are considered to be glycoproteins (6Major M.E. Feinstone S.M. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 1527-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), migrated at 37 and 64 kDa, respectively. However, the signals of both proteins were broad in Western blot analysis; in particular, that of the E2 protein (62 ∼ 66 kDa, Fig. 3). This is most likely because the E2 protein displays variations in glycosylation. The mechanism of HCV secretion into circulation in the natural viral life cycle is incompletely understood. Core protein is considered to be processed from viral precursor polypeptide outside the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas envelope proteins are processed inside endoplasmic reticulum. Viral-like particles have been observed in the endoplasmic reticulum during electron microscopic analysis of viral maturation using a full-length HCV cDNA clone. 2M. Kohara, M. Kaito, and S. Watanabe, unpublished observation. In the present study, the amount of circulating core protein in transgenic sera corresponded with serum ALT levels, which indicates hepatocyte damage (Table I). However, whether the release of HCV proteins by hepatocyte destruction is important in the natural viral life cycle remains unclear. Koike et al. (23Koike K. Moriya K. Ishibashi K. Yotsuyanagi H. Shizumi Y. Fujie H. Kurokawa K. Matsuura Y. Miyamura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) reported that HCV core gene transgenic mice developed hepatic steatosis and that HCV E1, E2 gene transgenic mice displayed no hepatitis phenotype in their liver, although they did have sialadenitis. Pasquinelli et al. (24Pasquinelli C. Shoenberger J.M. Chung J. Chang K.-M. Guidotti L.G. Selby M. Berger K. Lesniewski R. Houghton M. Chisari F.V. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) reported that neither core nor E2 transgenic mice displayed any pathological changes. Furthermore, Kawamura et al. (25Kawamura T. Furusaka A. Koziel M. Chung R.T. Wang T.C. Schmidt E.V. Liang T.J. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 1014-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) established HCV transgenic mice using HCV cDNA that contained HCV core to part of NS2 genome and also found no histological changes. In the present study, the CN2 transgenic mice developed acute hepatitis after AxCANCre infection (Fig. 6 C), which was comparable to the reported mouse hepatitis induced by recombinant adenovirus infection (14Yang Y. Xiang Z. Ertl H.C.J. Wilson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7257-7261Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 15Yang Y. Wilson J.M. J.

However, we observed no significant histopathological changes between infected and uninfected CN2 transgenic mice when CD4- and CD8-positive cells were depleted in the infected mice (Fig. 6, A and B). Having said that, these mice were only observed for 1 week. Taken together, these results suggest that HCV structural proteins are not strongly cytopathic to hepatocytes in the absence of immune responses. The Cre/loxP system enabled us to express an HCV transgene under temporal control. HCV proteins were transiently expressed and detected mainly in the liver. Importantly, an anti-core antibody response was observed in mouse sera after core protein production. Thus, this system allows investigation of the role of immune responses to transgene products. In addition, adoptive transfer of helper or killer T cells specific for HCV proteins to HCV-expressing transgenic nude mice should lead to the construction of an HCV hepatitis model. Therefore, this transgenic mouse system can be used to understand immunological phenomena in HCV infections. Furthermore, the delivery of Cre DNA recombinase is not limited to the use of recombinant adenovirus. Transgenics in which Cre is under control of the interferon-inducible Mx promoter or the tetracycline-responsive promoter have already been successfully constructed (26Kühn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar, 27St-Onge L. Furth P.A. Gruss P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3875-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, future research will focus on this line of investigation.

https://openalex.org/W2035671239,"The reactions of nitric oxide (NO) with fully oxidized cytochrome c oxidase (O) and the intermediates P and F have been investigated by optical spectroscopy, using both static and kinetic methods. The reaction of NO with O leads to a rapid (∼100 s−1) electron ejection from the binuclear center to cytochrome a and CuA. The reaction with the intermediates P and F leads to the depletion of these species in slower reactions, yielding the fully oxidized enzyme. The fastest optical change, however, takes place within the dead time of the stopped-flow apparatus (∼1 ms), and corresponds to the formation of the F intermediate (580 nm) upon reaction of NO with a species that we postulate is at the peroxide oxidation level. This species can be formulated as either Fe5+ = O CuB2+or Fe4+ = O CuB3+, and it is spectrally distinct from the P intermediate (607 nm). All of these reactions have been rationalized through a mechanism in which NO reacts with CuB2+, generating the nitrosonium species CuB1+ NO+, which upon hydration yields nitrous acid and CuB1+. This is followed by redox equilibration of CuB with Fea/CuA or Fea3 (in which Fea and Fea3 are the iron centers of cytochromes a and a3, respectively). In agreement with this hypothesis, our results indicate that nitrite is rapidly formed within the binuclear center following the addition of NO to the three species tested (O, P, and F). This work suggests that nitrosylation at CuB2+ instead of at Fea32+ is a key event in the fast inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase by NO."
https://openalex.org/W2091619297,"Apoptosis involves the activation of a cascade of interleukin-1β converting enzyme-like proteases (caspases), a group of cysteine proteases related to the prototype interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (caspase-1). These proteases cleave specific intracellular targets such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, DNA-dependent protein kinase, and nuclear lamins. We show here that apoptosis can be induced by double-stranded RNA. The induction of apoptosis by double-stranded RNA and other agents leads to the cleavage by a caspase of the signal transducer and activator of transcription factor, STAT1 which is pivotal in the signal transduction pathways of the interferons and many other cytokines and growth factors.

The product of this cleavage is no longer able to mediate interferon-activated signal transduction and the cleavage event may play a role in regulating the apoptosis response itself. Apoptosis is the process of programmed cell death, and is a common occurrence in embryogenesis and in the destruction of infected, damaged, or senescent cells (1Fraser A. Evan G. Cell. 1996; 85: 781-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 2Takahashi A. Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The biochemical processes involved in apoptosis can be divided into two discrete phases. A variable period of time elapses following exposure to apoptosis-inducing signals before cells become committed to undergo apoptosis. This phase is followed by the execution phase (more correctly a suicide phase, since apoptosis is cell autonomous) which, unlike the commitment phase, is irreversible. The execution phase is the best understood, and is characterized by changes in the cytoplasmic membrane, breakdown of the nuclear envelope, condensation of chromatin structure, and eventual destruction of the chromatin (laddering). Execution is associated with the activation of a family of cysteine-proteases (caspases) which are related to the enzyme required to process interleukin-1β (IL-1β) 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; IFN, interferon; TPCK,Nα-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; PKR, protein kinase R; ZVAD, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone; CHAPS,3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. from its precursor form (IL-1β-converting enzyme, caspase-1). It is not clear whether any single caspase can cause cell death, since these enzymes appear to be arranged in a complex network. Furthermore, to date, although several substrates have been identified for caspases, no single substrate cleavage has been shown to be essential for apoptosis, and the consensus of opinion is that cell death occurs “by a thousand cuts” (3Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). In addition to activation through occupation of surface receptors such as Fas or tumor necrosis factor, apoptosis can also be induced by intracellular signals such as DNA damage, inhibition of protein synthesis, and viral infection. We are interested in the specific means by which viral infection can cause cells to undergo apoptosis (4Hardwick J.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 41: 295-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Apoptosis of virally infected cells is important since it allows macrophages to destroy a cell before the completion of the viral life cycle and the release of infectious particles (5Savill J. Fadok V. Henson P. Haslett C. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 131-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). The significance of this is reflected by the fact that many viruses encode specific inhibitors of caspases (6Ray C.A. Black R.A. Kronheim S.R. Greenstreet T.A. Sleath P.R. Salvesan G.S. Pickup D.J.

Virol. 1994; 68: 3667-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Mori I. Komatsu T. Takeuchi K. Nakakuki K. Sudo M. Kimura Y. J. Gen.

Virol. 1993; 74: 2347-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is generated during influenza viral replication, and that this leads to the transcriptional activation of Fas antigen that is a key factor in inducing apoptosis (15Takizawa T. Fukuda R. Miyawaki T. Ohashi K. Nakanishi Y. Virology. 1995; 209: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Takizawa T. Ohashi K. Nakanishi Y. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8128-8132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we show that dsRNA is capable of inducing apoptosis without the requirement for de novo protein synthesis, indicating that susceptible cells contain a pre-existing pathway for the execution of apoptosis if exposed to dsRNA. This is highly reminiscent of the transcriptional induction of β-interferon (β-IFN) in response to viral infection or dsRNA treatment (17Goodbourn S. King P. Hames D. Eukaryotic Gene Transcription. Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 132-164Google Scholar). While investigating the effects of this dsRNA-induced apoptosis on the induction of β-IFN we discovered that the signal transducer and activator of transcription molecule, STAT1, becomes cleaved after aspartic acid 694 by a caspase. STAT1 is a transcription factor that becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine 701 by members of the JAK kinase family in response to IFNs and many other cytokines and growth factors (18Briscoe J. Guschin D. Muller M. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1033-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev.

Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar); this phosphorylation is required for dimerization and subsequent DNA binding and is thus essential for effective signal transduction. The removal of the C terminus of STAT1 by proteolysis consequently renders STAT1 unable to participate in signal transduction. This cleavage is also caused by inducers of apoptosis other than dsRNA, and may play a role in the down-regulation of cellular responses during cell death. HeLa (subclone E (21King P. Goodbourn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30609-30615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and U3A (22McKendry R. John J. Flavell D. Muller M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11455-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium supplemented with Glutamax (Life Technologies) + 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies). For dsRNA treatments, HeLa cells were grown until they were 80–90% confluent, primed by treatment with 500 units/ml human α-IFN (Wellferon, a mixture of naturally produced α-IFN subtypes; Glaxo-Wellcome) for 18 h, and then induced using 100 μg/ml dsRNA (poly(I)-poly(C); Pharmacia) for the lengths of times shown in the figures. Where indicated, cycloheximide was added to the medium at 50 μg/ml, at this concentration, protein synthesis is inhibited to >99.9% as determined by incorporation of labeled amino acids into total protein (23Whiteside S.T. Visvanathan K.V. Goodbourn S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1531-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The caspase inhibitor ZVAD (benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone; Enzyme System Products) was dissolved in Me2SO and added to cells at 100 μm at the same time as dsRNA. TPCK (Sigma) was dissolved in methanol and added to cells at 100 μm at the same time as dsRNA. Etoposide was dissolved in Me2SO and added to cells for 18 h at 50 μm. IFN treatment of U3A cells used 500 units of human α-IFN/ml or 500 units of human γ-IFN/ml for 3 h where indicated. Cells were lysed in sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) (500 μl/9 cm plate) and extracts (15 μl) were fractionated on 7.5% polyacrylamide/SDS gels. Gels were transferred to 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Pierce), blocked, incubated with specific antisera, and washed as recommended by the manufacturers. Experiments shown in this work used a polyclonal STAT1 antibody raised against the N-terminal 194 amino acids (Transduction Laboratories catalogue number G16930); we have also used monoclonal antibodies raised against the C terminus (Santa Cruz catalogue number sc-417) and an internal fragment (Transduction Laboratories catalogue number S21120) to characterize the STAT1* product (data not shown). STAT2, STAT3, and STAT6 antibodies were all monoclonal products raised against the respective N-terminal regions (Transduction Laboratories; catalogue numbers STAT2 = S21220; STAT3 = S21320; STAT6 = S25420) while the human PARP antibody was a rabbit polyclonal raised against a synthetic internal peptide (GVDEVAKKK; Upstate Biotechnology; catalogue number 06-557). The monoclonal antibody (MAbSV5-P-k) (25Hanke T. Szawlowski P. Randall R.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) recognizing amino acids 95–108 of the P and V proteins of simian virus 5 was obtained from Dr. R. Randall (University of St. Andrews). All protein-antibody interactions were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse (Amersham) and donkey anti-rabbit (Amersham) IgG as secondary antibodies for monoclonal and polyclonals, respectively. For re-probing, filters were stripped as described by the manufacturers. A cDNA sequence for human STAT1α was obtained by polymerase chain reaction and verified by partial sequencing and functional complementation in U3A cells (see Fig. 4). This cDNA was inserted between the NcoI and XbaI sites of the EF1α promoter vector pEFplink2 (a kind gift of Dr. R. H. Treisman, Imperial Cancer Research Fund) to generate pEFSTAT1α. The STAT1α cDNA was then epitope-tagged at the N terminus using oligonucleotides encoding the amino acids 95–108 (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) of the P and V proteins of simian virus 5 to generate pEFSTAT1αSV5. Single amino acid changes to alanine or glutamic acid at aspartic acid 694 or to a stop codon at glycine 695 were introduced into pEFSTAT1αSV5 using recombinant polymerase chain reaction to generate pEFSTAT1αSV5(D694A), pEFSTAT1αSV5(D694E), and pEFSTAT1αSV5(G695/STOP), respectively. The amino acid changes were confirmed by sequencing. The wild type STAT1α sequence and STAT1α genes containing the D694A and G695/STOP changes were transferred from these plasmids into the vector pT7βplink (26Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) as NcoI to XbaI fragments to generate pT7βSTAT1α, pT7βSTAT1α(D694A), and pT7βSTAT1α(G695/STOP), respectively. The reporter plasmid for α-IFN contained 4 copies of the 9–27 ISRE core (27Reid L.E. Brassnet A.H. Gilbert C.S. Porter A.C. Gewert D.R. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30609-30615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while the reporter plasmid for γ-IFN contained 2 copies of the IRF-1 GAS site (28Pine R. Canova A. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) (TTTCCCCGAAA) arranged in tandem upstream of the BamHI site of ptkΔ(−39)lucter. HeLa cells were transfected with 2 μg of DNA and 8 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies Inc.) according to the manufacturers instructions. U3A cells were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation with 10 μg of effector, 10 μg of reporter, and 2 μg of transfection control plasmid (pSV2CAT (29Gorman C. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar)). For reporter gene assays, lysates were prepared and assayed for luciferase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity as described previously (21King P. Goodbourn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30609-30615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was corrected to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity to normalize for variations in the transfection efficiency. Transfection experiments were repeated at least three times. Laddered cytoplasmic DNA was prepared from Triton X-100 lysates and labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the terminal transferase activity of Taq DNA polymerase (30Eldadah B.A. Yakovlev G.A. Faden A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4092-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Reaction products were fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.8% agarose gels in 0.089 m Trisborate, 0.002 mEDTA, and after drying the gel, visualized by autoradiography. Bacterial lysates were prepared from Escherichia coli BL21.DE3pLysS carrying a pET plasmid encoding recombinant caspase-3 (kindly provided by Dr. N. McCarthy, ICRF) or the control plasmid pET15b, as described previously (31Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R.C. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L.C. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). One microgram of lysate was incubated with 1 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled STAT1α or mutant forms of STAT1α (prepared by in vitro translation of linearized pT7βSTAT1α, pT7βSTAT1α(D694A), or pT7βSTAT1α(G695/STOP) in a standard TnT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation kit reaction; Promega Corp.), in a 10-μl reaction containing 25 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS at 37 °C for 1 h. The reactions were stopped by the addition of sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) then analyzed by fractionation on a 7.5% polyacrylamide/SDS gel followed by autoradiography. We have previously shown that β-IFN expression can be induced in HeLa cells in response to treatment with dsRNA (21King P. Goodbourn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30609-30615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Whiteside S.T. Visvanathan K.V. Goodbourn S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1531-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Induction occurs at the level of transcriptional initiation and does not require new protein synthesis, although the extent of induction can be much enhanced by a pretreatment with type I IFN (priming). We noted that during the induction process, cells exhibited an altered morphology consistent with the activation of apoptosis. To determine whether apoptosis could be induced by dsRNA, we treated HeLa cells with poly(I)-poly(C), which was added directly to the growth medium, and prepared DNA from induced cells. Fig. 1shows that a nucleosomal ladder characteristic of cells undergoing apoptosis is produced in response to dsRNA. When cycloheximide was included in the induction medium the degree of laddering was significantly enhanced, although consistent with results in other systems cycloheximide alone could cause some laddering (32Galea-Lauri J. Richardson A.J. Latchman D.S. Katz D.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4109-4118PubMed Google Scholar, 33Gossett R. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. McConkey D. Fadok V. Amoss M.S.J. J. Comp.

Dimitrov T. Hermiston T.W. Tollefson A.E. Ranheim T.S. Vande Pol S.B. Stephenson A.H. Wold W.S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4904-4913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Niwa M. Hara A. Kanamori Y. Kohno K. Yoshimi N. Mori H. Uematsu T. Life Sci. 1997; 61: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although it is not possible to determine from these results whether dsRNA and cycloheximide induce apoptosis through a common mechanism, the fact that the extent of apoptosis seen with the combination of dsRNA and cycloheximide is greater than that seen with either inducer alone demonstrates that cycloheximide cannot be blocking the dsRNA effect. Thus de novo protein synthesis cannot be required for the induction of apoptosis by dsRNA, a result that is consistent with the recent observations of others (37Der S.D. Yang Y.-L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3279-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Inclusion of the caspase inhibitor ZVAD (38Fearnhead H.O. Dinsdale D. Cohen G.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) in the induction mixture prevented DNA laddering (Fig. 1) and completely blocked the observed cell death (data not shown). HeLa cells contain two splice variant forms of STAT1, referred to as STAT1α (91 kDa) and STAT1β (84 kDa), respectively (Fig. 2 A). While investigating the role of STAT1 in the induction of β-IFN expression we discovered that exposure of HeLa cells to dsRNA for 2 h generated a novel form of STAT1 (STAT1*), migrating with slightly faster mobility than the 84-kDa form (STAT1β; Fig. 2 A). Since the production of STAT1* occurs with similar kinetics to the activation of apoptosis, we investigated whether STAT1*generation was associated with the activation of caspases. To determine whether the production of STAT1* required de novo protein synthesis, we repeated the induction of HeLa cells with dsRNA in the presence of cycloheximide. Although cycloheximide alone could also generate STAT1* to some degree, the combined treatment of HeLa cells with dsRNA and cycloheximide led to enhanced production of STAT1* (Fig. 2 B) and was accompanied by the loss of both STAT1α and -β. These results suggested that STAT1* is derived from STAT1α and -β by post-translational modification. To determine whether other members of the STAT family are similarly affected we examined the state of STAT2 and STAT3 (Fig. 2 C) and STAT6 (data not shown) in extracts from dsRNA- and cycloheximide-treated HeLa cells without seeing equivalent changes in mobility. By contrast, the well defined caspase substrate, PARP, is cleaved under the same conditions (Fig. 2 C). Fig. 2 D shows that STAT1* generation in cells treated with dsRNA and cycloheximide could be completely blocked by treating cells with the caspase inhibitor ZVAD, whereas the serine protease inhibitor, TPCK, was unable to affect cleavage. By contrast, TPCK completely inhibited dsRNA-dependent activation of NF-κB under the same conditions (39Mellits K.H. Hay R.T. Goodbourn S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5059-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), while ZVAD had no effect (data not shown). The cleavage of PARP was similarly blocked by ZVAD but not by TPCK (data not shown). To test whether STAT1* could be generated by other inducers of apoptosis, we treated HeLa cells with the DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide (40Walker P.R. Smith C. Youdale T. Leblanc J. Whitfield J.F. Sikorska M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 1078-1085PubMed Google Scholar). This treatment also resulted in the production of STAT1*, although we note that this treatment reproducibly leads to preferential cleavage of STAT1β over STAT1α (Fig. 2 D). Taken together, these results indicate that the dsRNA/cycloheximide induction mixture triggers apoptosis in HeLa cells and that during this process STAT1α and -β are converted to a shorter form, presumably by proteolytic cleavage. Because STAT1α and -β differ at their C termini, but are converted to a single product, it seemed likely that STAT1* is generated by a single cleavage event occurring near the C terminus of the protein. By using a panel of antibodies we were able to show that STAT1* lacks the C-terminal end of STAT1α and -β (data not shown). Since a caspase-mediated cleavage was strongly implicated by the above data, we inspected the C-terminal end of the human STAT1 protein sequence for an appropriate motif. We noticed a potential cleavage site for caspases at the aspartic acid residue at position 694 (Fig. 3 A). Cleavage at this site in STAT1 would produce a species with a predicted molecular mass of 81 kDa, in line with the observed size of STAT1*. To verify that this sequence was indeed a target for cleavage, we created an epitope-tagged wild type STAT1α expression vector, and ones in which the aspartic acid residue at position 694 was changed to alanine (D694A) or glutamic acid (D694E). When the epitope-tagged wild type form of STAT1α was expressed in HeLa cells, a protein with mobility similar to that of the endogenous form of STAT1α (91 kDa) could be observed (Fig. 3 B). A small amount of a protein with similar mobility to STAT1* (81 kDa, Fig. 3 B) could also be observed in untreated cells; this product is generated as a result of a low level of apoptosis induced by the transfection conditions, and can be blocked with ZVAD (data not shown). When cells were treated with dsRNA and cycloheximide the conversion of the 91- to the 81-kDa truncation form was much enhanced (Fig. 3 B). The 81-kDa form migrated with the same mobility as a protein produced by expression of a form of STAT1α truncated after amino acid 694 (G695/STOP) (Fig. 3 B), as expected if STAT1* is generated by cleavage at this site. In contrast to the wild type form, the D694A and D694E mutant forms of STAT1α were not cleaved upon induction (Fig. 3 B). Reprobing the Western blot with the STAT1 antibody showed that the endogenous STAT1α and -β were cleaved in each case (Fig. 3 B). These results confirmed the presence of a cleavage site at aspartic acid 694 in STAT1, and demonstrated that this site is cleaved in both STAT1α and -β during apoptosis. To confirm that STAT1 can be cleaved by a caspase, we tested whether recombinant STAT1 can be cleaved by recombinant caspase-3 since the cleavage site in STAT1 is similar to that seen in several caspase-3 substrates (Fig. 3 A). Fig. 4 demonstrates that the 91-kDa STAT1 protein is cleaved by caspase-3 to give an 81-kDa product that has the same mobility as STAT1α truncated after amino acid 694 (G695/STOP). This cleavage is not seen with control extracts, nor if the aspartic acid residue in the caspase cleavage consensus site was changed to alanine (D694A). Activation of STAT1 by α- and γ-IFN, by cytokines such as IL-6 and growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor, involves a single phosphorylation on tyrosine 701 (19Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar), and for maximal activity, serine 727 (53Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated, STAT1 can homo- or heterodimerize to produce complexes capable of binding to DNA and activating transcription (19Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). Clearly, cleavage of STAT1 after amino acid 694 would produce a truncated form of the protein that cannot be phosphorylated on tyrosine 701, and thus should not be activated by α- or γ-IFN. To test this, we examined the ability of STAT1* to rescue responses to α- and γ-IFN in U3A cells which lack functional STAT1 (54Muller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A. Silvennoinen O. Harpur A.G. Barbieri G. Witthuhn B.A. Schindler C. Pellegrini S. Wilks A.F. Ihle J.N. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1993; 366: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Responses to α-IFN were assessed using a reporter promoter containing a 15-mer “core” sequence that is a strong binding site for the type I-IFN-activated transcription factor ISGF3 (IFN stimulatable response element (55Friedman R.L. Manly S.P. McMahon M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 745-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 56Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Reich N. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar)), while responses to γ-IFN were assessed using a reporter promoter containing a GAS site from the IRF-1 promoter that is a strong binding site for the γ-IFN-activated factor (GAF). In contrast to wild-type STAT1, the truncated form (G695/STOP) was completely unable to rescue either α-IFN (Fig. 5 A) or γ-IFN (Fig. 5 B) responses. Altering amino acid 694 from an aspartic acid to an alanine (D694A) did not interfere with either signal transduction pathway (Fig. 5, A and B). These results demonstrate that the effect of the proteolytic cleavage of STAT1 during apoptosis would be to impair the ability of cells undergoing apoptosis to respond to a variety of cytokine- and growth factor-mediated signals. The data we have presented indicate that cells contain a dsRNA-sensitive switch which triggers a pre-established program of both apoptosis and β-IFN production. In neither case is concurrent protein synthesis required, and as a result there must be a means by which dsRNA can activate the caspases. Studies on the Fas and tumor necrosis factor receptors indicate that upon activation the receptors recruit adaptor molecules through cytoplasmic “death domains” (57Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 58Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H.W. Goeddel G.V.

Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar); these adaptors in turn recruit additional molecules which contain caspase motifs (61Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M.

Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Once recruited these molecules activate the downstream caspase cascade. One possible candidate for the mediation of the dsRNA signal is the cellular enzyme protein kinase R (PKR). This kinase is known to function to down-regulate protein synthesis in virally infected cells by phosphorylating the translational initiation factor eukaryotic initiation factor-2α (64Clemens M.J. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 139-172Google Scholar), but has also been shown to play a role in the activation of NF-κB by dsRNA (65Kumar A. Haque J. Lacoste J.

Biochem. 1995; 232: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that PKR may also signal to the apoptotic execution machinery. Consistent with this it has been shown that overexpression of PKR can cause apoptosis in cell culture (69Lee S.B. Esteban M. Virology. 1994; 199: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), while mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking PKR are unable to undergo apoptosis in response to dsRNA (37Der S.D. Yang Y.-L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3279-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PKR deficiency also impairs responses to other inducers of apoptosis (37Der S.D. Yang Y.-L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3279-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 70Yeung M.C. Liu J. Lau A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12451-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The identification of a link between PKR and the caspases represents a significant future goal. In these studies we have also demonstrated that the transcription factor STAT1, which is required for the ability of cells to respond to a wide variety of signals, is cleaved during apoptosis by a caspase. The protease inhibitor ZVAD used in our studies is a general caspase inhibitor (38Fearnhead H.O. Dinsdale D. Cohen G.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and we have yet to identify which specific member(s) of the caspase family is involved in generating STAT1* in vivo, although we have demonstrated that caspase-3 can cleave STAT1 efficiently in vitro. Although the cleavage site in STAT1 has a number of similarities to the sites known to be substrates for caspase-3 (Fig. 3 A), we note that it also has some similarity with substrates for caspase-1, especially the minor caspase-1 cleavage product of pro-IL-1β (49Sleath P.R.

While we have yet to test it directly, we speculate that STAT1 may also be a caspase-1 substrate, since caspase-1 appears to be rather promiscuous in its preferences (71Margolin N. Raybuck S.A.

It is also interesting to note that STAT1 is not cleaved at amino acid 143 despite containing an ELDS motif in this region, and that STAT3 and STAT6 are also refractory to cleavage despite containing possible caspase cleavage sites (Fig. 3 A). We speculate that cleavage by caspases could be prevented by the tertiary structure of some proteins. The C-terminal cleavage product of STAT1 has lost the tyrosine residue at position 701 and thus cannot be activated by α- and γ-IFN as shown here, or presumably by the other ligands that activate by promoting this phosphorylation. It is pertinent to ask what role STAT1 inactivation could play in the apoptotic response. It has previously been observed that many cell types, including fibroblast (74Harrington E.A. Bennet M.R. Fanidi A. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) and hematopoeitic cells (75Lotem J. Sachs L. Leukemia. 1996; 10: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar) can undergo apoptosis as a result of becoming depleted of growth factors or cytokines and can be rescued by the addition of defined survival factors, which include STAT1 activators such as platelet-derived growth factor (74Harrington E.A. Bennet M.R. Fanidi A. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar), colony-stimulating factor (76Williams G.T. Smith C.A. Spooncer E. Dexter T.M. Taylor D.R. Nature. 1990; 343: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar), and γ-IFN (77Lotem J. Sachs L. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 685-692PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting to speculate that one consequence of apoptosis is to down-regulate the ability of a cell to respond to such factors. Since multiple growth factors can protect cells against apoptosis, we think it unlikely that STAT1 cleavage alone would be sufficient to render cells insensitive to protection by survival factors. Nevertheless, inactivation of STAT1 function may be an example of a class of modifications that ensures that the commitment phase of apoptosis is irreversible. An alternative role for STAT1 cleavage is suggested by the recent demonstration that STAT1 can play a role in apoptosis by up-regulating the level of caspase-1 in response to cytokines (78Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5328-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Consistent with this we have determined that the degree of apoptotic death we observe in response to dsRNA and cycloheximide is much enhanced if cells are primed by a prior exposure to either type I or type II IFN (data not shown). When cells are challenged with an apoptosis-inducing signal, the inactivation of STAT1 would lower the levels of caspase, and thus might play a role in limiting the propensity of a cell to undergo apoptosis. The resolution of this issue awaits further study.

Here, we describe a novel DNA carrier protein termed GD5 that mimics the structure of the bacterial diphtheria toxin (DT) and facilitates target cell-specific gene transfer via receptor-mediated endocytosis. GD5 carries at the N terminus the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4, which is connected to a C-terminal antibody fragment specific for the tumor-associated ErbB2 antigen via an internal DT translocation domain as an endosome escape activity. Bacterially expressed GD5 protein specifically bound to ErbB2-expressing cells and formed protein-DNA complexes with a luciferase reporter gene construct. These complexes, after compensation of excess negative charge with poly-l-lysine, served as a specific transfection vector for ErbB2-expressing cells. Inhibitors of endosomal acidification drastically reduced GD5-mediated transfection, indicating that the DT translocation domain of GD5, similar to the parental toxin, is strictly dependent on the transit through an acidic environment. Our results suggest that fusion proteins that employ the natural endosome escape mechanism of bacterial toxins might aid in the development of efficient nonviral vectors for applications in gene therapy.

Our results suggest that fusion proteins that employ the natural endosome escape mechanism of bacterial toxins might aid in the development of efficient nonviral vectors for applications in gene therapy. The specific delivery of therapeutic genes to defined target cell populations is a major goal of gene therapeutic strategies. Viral vectors generally facilitate highly efficient transfer and expression of foreign genes, but attempts to modify their target cell specificity have proven difficult and can result in a significant reduction of infectivity (1Schnierle B.S. Groner B. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 1069-1073PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, nonviral vectors, while still less efficient in gene delivery than viral particles, are gaining increasing attention (2Cooper M.J. Semin. Oncol. 1996; 23: 172-187PubMed Google Scholar). Self-assembling systems such as complexes of DNA with polycationic polymers can be easily manipulated with respect to their target cell specificity, and they are safe due to the absence of viral genomic sequences and highly flexible in the size of the DNA incorporated. Molecular conjugates of poly-l-lysine with natural or artificial ligands utilize the DNA-binding and -condensing properties of poly-l-lysine for the interaction with DNA (3Wu G.Y. Wu C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4429-4432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wagner E. Cotten M. Foisner R. Birnstiel M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Upon formation of a DNA-poly-l-lysine-ligand complex (polyplex (6Felgner P.L. Barenholz Y. Behr J.P. Cheng S.H. Cullis P. Huang L. Jessee J.A. Seymour L. Szoka F. Thierry A.R. Wagner E. Wu G. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 511-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar)), gene transfer is facilitated via receptor-mediated endocytosis. While these conjugates deliver the DNA to defined target cell populations, for efficient gene transfer, they require an additional mechanism that, upon internalization of the polyplex, facilitates the release of DNA from endosomal vesicles and prevents lysosomal degradation. To achieve this, adenoviral particles (7Curiel D.T. Agarwal S. Wagner E. Cotten M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8850-8854Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) or fusogenic peptides of viral origin (8Wagner E. Plank C. Zatloukal K. Cotten M. Birnstiel M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7934-7938Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) have been included in the polyplex, thereby exploiting the natural endosome escape mechanism of viruses, which is dependent on a drop in the endosomal pH during intracellular trafficking. Similar to these viral activities, a number of bacterial toxins, upon cell binding and internalization, depend on endosomal acidification as a trigger to induce a conformational change within a specialized translocation domain. This promotes insertion into vesicular membranes and allows the delivery of an enzymatically active toxin fragment to the cytosol of target cells (9Olsnes S. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1993; 182: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). By replacing the enzymatic domain with sequences of heterologous origin, fusion proteins have been derived that employ the natural internalization mechanism of such toxins for the intracellular delivery of nontoxic peptides or protein domains (10Donnelly J.J. Ulmer J.B. Hawe L.A. Friedman A. Shi X.P. Leander K.R. Shiver J.W. Oliff A.I. Martinez D. Montgomery D. Liu M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We recently described a modular fusion protein that is based on the molecular organization of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (ETA) 1The abbreviations used are: ETA, exotoxin A; DT, diphtheria toxin; EGF, epidermal growth factor; scFv, single chain antibody. and that facilitates target cell-specific gene delivery via receptor-mediated endocytosis (12Fominaya J. Wels W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10560-10568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In this protein, the C-terminal enzymatic domain of the toxin was exchanged with a DNA-binding function, and specific binding to target cells was accomplished by replacing the toxin's natural cell recognition domain with a recombinant antibody fragment. Here, we have extended this approach and describe the construction, bacterial expression, and functional characterization of a novel carrier protein for target cell-specific gene transfer. This chimeric protein, termed GD5, is based on the molecular organization of diphtheria toxin (DT), another bacterial toxin with functional similarities to Pseudomonas ETA. DT is a single chain polypeptide of 535 residues (13Greenfield L. Bjorn M.J. Horn G. Fong D. Buck G.A. Collier R.J. Kaplan D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6853-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) that, in contrast to ETA, carries the catalytic domain at the N terminus followed by an internal translocation domain and the C-terminal cell-binding domain (14Choe S. Bennett M.J. Fujii G. Curmi P.M. Kantardjieff K.A. Collier R.J. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 357: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The chimeric GD5 fusion protein mimics the structure of wild-type DT and connects, via the DT translocation domain, an N-terminal Gal4 DNA-binding region and a C-terminal ErbB2-specific single chain antibody fragment as heterologous effector and cell recognition functions, respectively. Thereby, the DNA-binding domain derived from the yeast Gal4 transcription factor allows complexation of the chimeric molecule with plasmid DNA containing the Gal4 recognition motif (15Carey M. Kakidani H. Leatherwood J. Mostashari F. Ptashne M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The chosen scFv(FRP5) antibody domain facilitates binding to the tumor-associated antigen ErbB2, which is overexpressed in many human tumors of epithelial origin and has been proposed as a suitable target for directed cancer therapy (16Hynes N.E. Stern D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 17Wels W. Groner B. Hynes N.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 213: 113-128PubMed Google Scholar). Upon bacterial expression and purification, the GD5 fusion protein spontaneously formed a protein-DNA complex with a luciferase reporter gene construct, which, after condensation of the DNA and compensation of excess negative charge with poly-l-lysine, served as a specific transfection vector for ErbB2-expressing cells. Thereby, the transfection efficiency of GD5-DNA complexes was strictly dependent on the transit through an acidic environment, suggesting that the bacterial translocation domain in the chimeric DNA carrier protein functions in a fashion very similar to the wild-type toxin. COS-1 SV40-transformed African green monkey kidney cells and SKBR3 and MDA-MB468 human breast carcinoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker, Inc.) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HC11 murine mammary epithelial cells and HC11-ErbB2 cells (HC11 R1#11) stably transfected with a human erbB2 cDNA were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml bovine insulin, 10 ng/ml EGF, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 mg/ml G418 (HC11-ErbB2) as described (18Hynes N.E. Taverna D. Harwerth I.M. Ciardiello F. Salomon D.S. Yamamoto T. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4027-4034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pSW50-G encoding the DNA-binding domain of the yeast Gal4 transcription factor (Gal4 amino acids 2–147) was derived by HindIII cleavage of plasmid pSW50–5EG (12Fominaya J. Wels W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10560-10568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and subsequent religation of the vector fragment. A double-stranded oligonucleotide adapter withSacI and SalI compatible ends and containing an internal NheI restriction site was constructed by annealing the oligonucleotides 5′-CGCTAGCTGGTGGTG-3′ and 5′-TCGACACCACCAGCTAGCGAGCT-3′ and inserted into SacI/SalI-digested pSW50-G. A gene fragment encoding the DT translocation domain (Val195–Gly383) was derived by polymerase chain reaction using, as a template, plasmid pJV127, which contains a DT-interleukin-2 fusion gene (19vanderSpek J.C. Mindell J.A. Finkelstein A. Murphy J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12077-12082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the primers 5′-CGTGTCAGGCTAGCAGTAGGTAGC-3′ and 5′-CATGCGTGTCGACACCCGGAGAGTAAGC-3′, which introduce NheI and SalI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the polymerase chain reaction fragment, respectively. Plasmid pSW50-GD was obtained by cleavage of the resulting DT polymerase chain reaction product with NheI and SalI and insertion into NheI/SalI-digested pSW50-G containing the adapter sequence. A cDNA fragment encoding the ErbB2-specific single chain antibody scFv(FRP5) was obtained by SalI/BglII digestion of plasmid pWW152-5 (20Wels W. Beerli R. Hellmann P. Schmidt M. Marte B.M. Kornilova E.S. Hekele A. Mendelsohn J. Groner B. Hynes N.E. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 60: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and inserted in-frame 3′ of Gal4 and DT sequences in SalI/BglII-digested plasmid pSW50-GD, resulting in construct pSW50-GD5. Subsequently,HindIII/KpnI and KpnI/XhoI fragments of the fusion gene were isolated and reassembled in theHindIII/XhoI-digested bacterial expression vector pSW55, which is similar to pSW50, but lacks the bacterialompA signal sequence. The resulting pSW55-GD5 plasmid encodes, under the control of the inducible tac promoter, the GD5 fusion protein consisting of a synthetic FLAG epitope and six histidine residues at the N terminus followed by the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, the DT translocation domain, and the ErbB2-specific antibody fragment at the C terminus. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)trxB− cells (kindly provided by A. Plückthun) (21Proba K. Ge L. Plückthun A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 159: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) carrying plasmid pSW55-GD5 were grown at 37 °C to A550 = 0.7 in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.6% glucose. Protein expression was induced for 90 min at room temperature by the addition of 0.25 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation; resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 8 m urea, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and lysed by sonication. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C and loaded onto a Ni2+-saturated chelating Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) under denaturing conditions (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 8m urea). Unbound proteins were removed by washing the column with equilibration buffer containing 50 mmimidazole. Specifically bound proteins were eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration of the buffer to 250 mm. For complete denaturation and reduction of disulfide bonds, fractions containing the GD5 fusion protein were pooled and treated with 0.3m dithioerythritol for 2 h at room temperature. The samples were then diluted 50-fold in refolding buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 8 mm oxidized glutathione, 0.5 ml-arginine, 2 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl. Refolding of the protein was allowed to take place for 2 days at 10 °C. Subsequently, the refolded protein was concentrated and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ZnCl2, and 20% glycerol. The binding of the GD5 fusion protein to ErbB2 was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using ErbB2-expressing HC11-ErbB2 cells and parental HC11 cells as a control. Trypsinized cells (5 × 105) in phosphate-buffered saline were incubated for 40 min at 4 °C with 3 μg of purified GD5 protein. Unbound proteins were removed, and cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then treated with 1 μg of monoclonal antibody RK5C1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) specific for the Gal4 DNA-binding domain for another 40 min followed by phycoerythrin-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Rockland Inc.) as a secondary antibody. Fluorescence of cells was analyzed with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Transfection complexes were prepared by incubation of 2 μg of pSV2G4LUC plasmid DNA (12Fominaya J. Wels W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10560-10568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) with variable amounts of the GD5 fusion protein in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 μmZnCl2 for 15 min at room temperature. To facilitate condensation of the protein-DNA complex, poly-l-lysine HBr (Sigma) with an average degree of polymerization of 236 residues (pL236) was added slowly to the complex to a final concentration of 250 nm, and the mixture (total volume of 100 μl) was incubated for an additional 15 min. For transfection, cells were seeded in 12-well tissue culture plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well and grown overnight at 37 °C. The growth medium was exchanged with 1 ml/well fresh medium 30 min before the addition of protein-DNA complexes (100 μl/well). The cells were incubated with protein-DNA complexes for 4 h at 37 °C; then the medium was exchanged, and the cells were grown for another 40 h before they were harvested for analysis. Luciferase assays were performed as described (12Fominaya J. Wels W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10560-10568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The growth medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 15 min at room temperature in 100 μl of buffer containing 25 mmglycylglycine, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15% glycerol, 8 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and protein content was determined by the Bradford method (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Fifty μl of the lysate were mixed with an identical volume of dilution buffer containing 25 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 10 mmMgSO4, and 5 mm ATP. Luciferase activity was monitored for 30 s in a AutoLumat LB 953 luminometer (Berthold) with automatic injection of 300 μl of luciferin solution containing 250 mm luciferin (Sigma), 25 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, and 0.5 mm coenzyme A (Boehringer Mannheim). Luciferase activity was determined as relative light units/mg of cellular protein. DNA fragments encoding the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain of the Gal4 transcription factor from the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the translocation domain of the bacterial diphtheria toxin, and the ErbB2-specific single chain antibody scFv(FRP5) were assembled into a single open reading frame in the bacterial expression vector pSW55. The resulting plasmid (pSW55-GD5) encodes, under the control of the isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducibletac promoter, the modular fusion protein GD5, which is shown schematically in Fig. 1 A. It consists of an N-terminal synthetic FLAG epitope, a polyhistidine tag facilitating the purification of the chimeric protein via Ni2+ affinity chromatography, amino acids 2–147 of the yeast Gal4 protein (15Carey M. Kakidani H. Leatherwood J. Mostashari F. Ptashne M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), amino acids 195–383 of diphtheria toxin (13Greenfield L. Bjorn M.J. Horn G. Fong D. Buck G.A. Collier R.J. Kaplan D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6853-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and the C-terminal scFv(FRP5) antibody domain (23Wels W. Harwerth I.M. Zwickl M. Hardman N. Groner B. Hynes N.E. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 1128-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) trxB− and purified from cleared bacterial lysates under denaturing conditions via binding to Ni2+-saturated chelating Sepharose and elution with 250 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the recombinant fusion protein were pooled, and the protein was refolded and dialyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A typical result of the purification is shown in Fig. 1 B. GD5 fusion protein with a purity of >80% was obtained after a single round of purification as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining (Fig. 1 B, lane 3) and was detected as a single band with calculated molecular mass of 67.9 kDa after immunoblotting with the FLAG-specific antibody M2 (Fig. 1 B,lanes 4 and 5). The C-terminal scFv(FRP5) antibody domain was included in the chimeric GD5 protein to direct the protein specifically to ErbB2-expressing target cells and, upon binding to the ErbB2 receptor, to facilitate uptake of protein-DNA complexes via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The functionality of the scFv(FRP5) domain in the GD5 protein was investigated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. HC11 murine mammary epithelial cells or HC11-ErbB2 cells stably transfected with a human erbB2cDNA (18Hynes N.E. Taverna D. Harwerth I.M. Ciardiello F. Salomon D.S. Yamamoto T. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4027-4034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were incubated with GD5, and specifically bound fusion protein was detected with a monoclonal antibody directed against the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and with phycoerythrin-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. The results are shown in Fig. 2. Strong binding of GD5 to HC11-ErbB2 cells, but no significant binding to HC11 control cells, was observed, showing that the scFv(FRP5) domain in the GD5 protein is functionally active and directs the fusion protein to ErbB2-expressing cells. In an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiment, also binding of GD5 to recombinant ErbB2 protein with half-maximal saturation at a concentration of 12 nm was observed (data not shown). The DNA-binding activity of GD5 was confirmed in a gel retardation assay. As described previously for a fusion protein containing an identical Gal4 fragment (12Fominaya J. Wels W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10560-10568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), the addition of purified GD5 to a 32P-labeled Gal4-specific oligonucleotide resulted in the formation of a protein-DNA complex with lower electrophoretic mobility on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (data not shown). For the analysis of GD5-mediated gene transfer, we used the reporter gene plasmid pSV2G4LUC, which encodes the firefly luciferase gene under the control of the SV40 early promoter and contains two consecutive Gal4 recognition motifs in the 3′-untranslated region of the expression cassette for interaction with Gal4 fusion proteins (12Fominaya J. Wels W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10560-10568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of purified GD5 protein were mixed with circular pSV2G4LUC plasmid DNA to allow complex formation. Subsequently, poly-l-lysine with an average chain length of 236 residues (pL236) was added to the protein-DNA complex to neutralize excess negative charge and to achieve condensation of the DNA (4Wagner E.

We used a pL236/DNA molar ratio of 50:1, which results in an electroneutral complex as confirmed by gel retardation assays (data not shown). The GD5-DNA-poly-l-lysine complex (GD5-polyplex) was added to COS-1 SV40-transformed monkey kidney cells at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml pSV2G4LUC plasmid DNA, 0.5–4.5 μg/ml GD5 fusion protein, and 25 nm pL236 in standard growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells incubated with a similar polyplex lacking the GD5 fusion protein served as a control. COS-1 cells express high levels of ErbB2 protein on their surface and have previously been used as a model system for the analysis of ErbB2-specific gene transfer (12Fominaya J. Wels W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10560-10568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with the transfection complexes for 4 h; then the medium was exchanged, and the cells were grown for an additional 40 h before they were harvested and analyzed for luciferase activity. The results are shown in Fig. 3 A. Treatment of cells with GD5-containing polyplex resulted in efficient expression of the luciferase reporter gene, which was up to 25-fold higher than in cells treated with polyplex alone. Thereby, luciferase activity correlated with the amount of DNA carrier protein in the transfection complex. To analyze the dependence of GD5-mediated gene transfer on the interaction of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain with its DNA recognition sequence, COS-1 cells were treated with GD5-polyplex containing either pSV2G4LUC or the similar pSV2LUC plasmid, which lacks Gal4-specific DNA recognition sequences (24Fominaya J. Uherek C. Wels W. Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B, in the absence of a Gal4-specific recognition sequence in the plasmid DNA, the efficiency of GD5-mediated gene transfer was drastically reduced, demonstrating the requirement of specific protein-DNA interaction for carrier protein-mediated gene transfer. The target cell specificity of GD5-mediated gene transfer was investigated using COS-1 and SKBR3 human breast carcinoma cells, which express ∼2 × 105 and 1 × 106 ErbB2 molecules/cell, respectively (12Fominaya J. Wels W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10560-10568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 20Wels W. Beerli R. Hellmann P. Schmidt M. Marte B.M. Kornilova E.S. Hekele A.

Cancer. 1995; 60: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); MDA-MB468 human breast carcinoma cells, which do not express detectable ErbB2 levels (20Wels W. Beerli R. Hellmann P. Schmidt M. Marte B.M. Kornilova E.S. Hekele A. Mendelsohn J. Groner B. Hynes N.E. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 60: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); and HC11 cells, which do express the murine ErbB2 homologue, but are not recognized by the FRP5 antibody, which is specific for the human ErbB2 molecule (25Harwerth I.M. Wels W. Marte B.M. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15160-15167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were treated with polyplex containing pSV2G4LUC plasmid DNA and 4.5 μg/ml GD5 fusion protein for 4 h as described above, and luciferase activity was determined 40 h later. Control cells were treated with polyplex lacking the carrier protein. High levels of luciferase activity were detected in ErbB2-expressing COS-1 and SKBR3 cells after treatment with GD5-polyplex, whereas only low nonspecific DNA uptake and reporter gene expression were found in cells treated with polyplex alone (Fig. 4). In contrast, the ErbB2-negative cell lines MDA-MB468 and HC11 could not be transfected with GD5-polyplex. These results indicate that GD5-mediated gene transfer is cell type-specific and dependent on the accessibility of ErbB2 receptors on the surface of target cells. The chimeric GD5 molecule contains the translocation domain of the bacterial diphtheria toxin as a means to facilitate endosome escape of protein-DNA complexes upon internalization into target cells. Previously, the acidotropic reagent chloroquine (26Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been shown to serve as an endosome escape activity and to dramatically enhance the efficiency of various nonviral gene transfer vectors that utilize receptor-mediated endocytosis for DNA delivery (27Zenke M. Steinlein P. Wagner E. Cotten M. Beug H. Birnstiel M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3655-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 28Cotten M. Langle-Rouault F. Kirlappos H.

Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Chloroquine blocks endosomal acidification, but also accumulates in intracellular vesicles and induces osmotic swelling of the endosomes, which could result in endosome destabilization and the release of internalized DNA (30Wagner E. Curiel D. Cotten M. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 1994; 14: 113-135Crossref Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The effect of chloroquine on GD5-mediated gene delivery was investigated using COS-1 cells. The cells were treated with GD5-polyplex as described above in the presence or absence of 100 μm chloroquine. Control cells were treated with polyplex lacking the fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 5, chloroquine had a drastic effect on gene transfer mediated by polyplex alone, which resulted in an ∼20-fold increase in reporter gene expression. In contrast, GD5-mediated gene transfer was enhanced only 2-fold in the presence of chloroquine, suggesting that GD5 already provides an efficient endosome escape mechanism. Intact diphtheria toxin binds to the heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor precursor on the surface of target cells (31Naglich J.G. Metherall J.E. Russell D.W. Eidels L. Cell. 1992; 69: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Upon receptor-mediated internalization, the DT translocation domain integrates into the endosomal membrane and facilitates translocation of the N-terminal enzymatic domain of the toxin across the membrane to the cytosol. For this membrane insertion, a conformational change of the translocation domain is required, which is induced by a drop in the endosomal pH below 5.5, resulting in the exposure of membrane-interacting hydrophobic helices (14Choe S.

Due to its dependence on a low pH environment, the cytotoxic activity of wild-type diphtheria toxin can be reduced significantly if endosomal acidification is prevented with specific inhibitors (34Umata T. Moriyama Y. Futai M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21940-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2167682559,"We have examined the in vivo activity of receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase α (PTPα) toward p59fyn, a widely expressed Src family kinase. In a coexpression system, PTPα effected a dose-dependent tyrosine dephosphorylation and activation of p59fyn, where maximal dephosphorylation correlated with a 5-fold increase in kinase activity. PTPα expression resulted in increased accessibility of the p59fyn SH2 domain, consistent with a PTPα-mediated dephosphorylation of the regulatory C-terminal tyrosine residue of p59fyn. No p59fyn dephosphorylation was observed with an enzymatically inactive mutant form of PTPα or with another receptor-like PTP, CD45. Many enzyme-linked receptors are complexed with their substrates, and we examined whether PTPα and p59fyn underwent association. Reciprocal immunoprecipitations and assays detected p59fyn and an appropriate kinase activity in PTPα immunoprecipitates and PTPα and PTP activity in p59fyn immunoprecipitates. No association between CD45 and p59fyn was detected in similar experiments. The PTPα-mediated activation of p59fyn is not prerequisite for association since wild-type and inactive mutant PTPα bound equally well to p59fyn. Endogenous PTPα and p59fyn were also found in association in mouse brain. Together, these results demonstrate a physical and functional interaction of PTPα and p59fyn that may be of importance in PTPα-initiated signaling events.

Members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases have been implicated in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes. These include mediating mitogenic responses initiated by growth factor receptors, control of cellular architecture through cytoskeletal reorganization, the UV and stress response, mitotic functions, and the induction of tumors (for review, see Ref. 1Erpel T. Courtneidge S.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). While the biological roles of the Src family kinases are not known, it is well established that the activities of these kinases are regulated, in part, by the phosphorylation state of the negative regulatory tyrosine residue corresponding to Tyr-527 of p60c-src (reviewed in Refs. 2Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar and 3Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Preventing phosphorylation of this residue either by association with the polyoma virus middle T-antigen or by mutation to phenylalanine or dephosphorylation of this residue by protein-tyrosine phosphatases results in increased catalytic and transforming activity (5Cartwright C.A.

Presumably, there are other PTPs that regulate the Src family kinases in cells lacking CD45. One possible candidate is PTPα, a receptor-type PTP. PTPα is a widely expressed protein that differs from most other receptor-like PTPs in having a very short extracellular domain with no adhesion motifs (16Matthews R.J. Cahir E.D. Thomas M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4444-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H.

A. 1990; 87: 7000-7004Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PTPα leads to cell transformation and to neuronal differentiation in rat embryo fibroblasts and in P19 carcinoma cells, respectively (20Zheng X.M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 21den Hertog J. Pals C.E.M. Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G.J. de Laat S.W. Kruijer W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3789-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This is similar to the actions of overexpressed epidermal growth factor receptor in A431 and PC12 cells (22Osherov N. Levitsky A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1047-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 23Traverse S. Seedorf K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. Ullrich A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), suggesting that PTPα may normally play a role in stimulating cell proliferation. The intracellular mediators of PTPα signaling are not known. The tyrosine kinase pp60c-src is a candidate PTPα substrate since PTPα overexpression in rat embryo fibroblasts and P19 cells results in pp60c-src dephosphorylation and activation (20Zheng X.M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 21den Hertog J. Pals C.E.M. Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G.J. de Laat S.W. Kruijer W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3789-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). PTPα may also exert some of its cellular effects through its ability to bind the adaptor protein Grb2 (24den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 25Su J. Batzer A. Sap J. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28086-28096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Downstream components in a PTPα signaling pathway may include mitogen-activated protein kinase and the transcription factor c-Jun, both of which are activated in PTPα-overexpressing rat embryo fibroblast cells (28Zheng X.M. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23302-23309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether PTPα mediates the dephosphorylation of other cellular proteins besides pp60c-src is unknown. The similar structure and mode of regulation of Src family kinases suggest that other members of this family may be PTPα substrates. The identification of PTPα substrates is an important step in elucidating the biological role of PTPα. In this study, we have investigated the action of PTPα toward p59fyn, prompted by a combination of reasons. First, besides pp60c-src, only the Src family kinases p59fyn and p62yes share a broad expression pattern with PTPα (1Erpel T. Courtneidge S.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In addition, PTPα is highly expressed in brain (18Sap J. D'Eustachio P. Givol D. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6112-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 29Fang K.S. Martins-Green M. Williams L.T. Hanafusa H. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and PTPα, pp60c-src, and p59fyn are implicated in or associated with certain neuronal cell functions including neuronal differentiation (PTPα (21den Hertog J.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar)), axonal growth (pp60c-src (33Ignelzi M.A. Miller D.R. Soriano P. Maness P.F. Neuron. 1994; 12: 873-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and p59fyn (34Beggs H.E. Soriano P. Maness P.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar)), myelination (p59fyn (35Umemori H. Sato S. Yagi S. Aizawa S. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1994; 367: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar)), and spatial learning and memory (p59fyn (36Grant S.G.N. O'Dell T.J. Karl K.A. Stein P.L. Soriano P. Kandel E.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar)). Second, together with pp60c-src, p59fyn is well defined in terms of its cellular actions. While studies in mutant mice show that Src and Fyn kinases have a high degree of functional redundancy (37Stein P.L. Vogel H. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1999-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), nevertheless, they also have specific and distinct functions (for example, in cytoskeletal organization (38Thomas S.M. Soriano P. Imamoto A. Nature. 1995; 376: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and adhesion molecule-directed axonal growth (33Ignelzi M.A. Miller D.R. Soriano P. Maness P.F. Neuron. 1994; 12: 873-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 34Beggs H.E. Soriano P. Maness P.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar)). It is thus important to define which specific intermediate signaling molecules may mediate a spectrum of PTPα-directed cellular events. Numbering of the PTPα amino acid sequence is according to Krueger et al. (17Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3241-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The expression vector pXJ41-PTPα-neo, encoding full-length PTPα, has been described (20Zheng X.M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The mutagenesis altering the essential cysteine residues to serine residues in the active sites of PTPα (C414S/C704S) has been described (39Lim K.L. Lai D.S.Y. Kalousek M.B. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and a fragment of this cDNA was used to replace the corresponding piece of wild-type PTPα cDNA to produce pXJ41-PTPα(C414S/C704S)-neo. Vectors expressing VSVG-tagged versions of PTPα were constructed as follows. Primers (with PacI sites added) corresponding to the amino acid sequences RVGIHL and MNRLGK found at either end of a 29-amino acid C-terminal fragment of VSVG (40Rose J.K. Welch W.J. Sefton B.M. Esch F.S. Ling N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3884-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) were used in a polymerase chain reaction with VSVG cDNA (a gift from Dr. S. H. Wong) as template. The primer sequences were 5′-GCGGTTAATTAACCGAGTTGGTATTTATCTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCGGTTAATTAACTTTCCAAGTCGGTTCAT-3′ (reverse). The amplified fragment was inserted into a unique PacI site in the PTPα cDNAs of pXJ41-neo, permitting the expression of PTPα proteins with a VSVG tag at amino acid 16 in the extracellular region. Plasmid containing CD45 cDNA (pAW-HCLA) was a gift of Dr. G. Koretzky. The CD45 cDNA insert was removed with HindIII and subcloned into the HindIII site of pXJ41-Hy (pXJ41 containing the gene conferring hygromycin resistance). fyn cDNA was isolated from a human fetal brain cDNA library in λgt11 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and subcloned into theEcoRI site of pXJ41-neo. Murine neuronal c-srccDNA (NcoI fragment in pGEM5Z(+); Promega) was a gift of Dr. P. Bello. The c-src cDNA insert was removed with SphI and SacI and blunt end-ligated into theEcoRI site of pXJ41-neo. COS-1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. COS-1 cells at 50–70% confluency (100-mm dishes) were transfected with plasmid DNA by liposome-mediated transfection with 30 μl (1 mg/ml) of Lipofectin™ or LipofectAMINE™ reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 5–6 h as described by the manufacturer and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for an additional 18–40 h prior to harvesting. The empty expression plasmid pXJ41-neo was used to normalize the amount of DNA in each transfection. In experiments that did not involve the association of PTPα (or CD45) and p59fyn, cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells either in buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mmNa3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (see Figs. 2 and4 C) or in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (see Figs. 1 and 3) for 60 min at 4 °C. Cytosol and Triton X-100-solubilized membrane fractions of cells were obtained as described (20Zheng X.M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), essentially involving initial lysis of cells by sonication in buffer A without Triton X-100. In experiments involving co-immunoprecipitation of PTPα (or CD45) and p59fyn, cell lysates were prepared in 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Brij 96, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (see Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and protein content was determined by Bradford analysis (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7 or 9% gel and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were immunoblotted with anti-PTPα antiserum 3897 (raised against a glutathioneS-transferase/PTPα-D2 fusion protein (39Lim K.L. Lai D.S.Y. Kalousek M.B. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Eur. J.

Immunoblots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitations of cell lysates were carried out using 250–600 μg of protein. For immunoprecipitation of p59fyn, either anti-Fyn antiserum (a gift of C. Rudd; see Fig. 1) or anti-Fyn polyclonal antibody (FYN3-G, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added to the cell lysates and incubated for 60–120 min at 4 °C. For pp60c-src and VSVG-PTPα immunoprecipitations, anti-pp60c-src or anti-VSVG monoclonal antibodies were added to the cell lysates and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C, followed by incubation with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako Corp.) for another 60 min at 4 °C. Protein A cell suspension (Sigma) was then added and mixed at 4 °C for 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times each in the respective cell lysis buffer (see above) and once in either 2× kinase assay buffer or phosphatase assay buffer (see below). Immunoblot analysis of the immunoprecipitated proteins was as described above.Figure 4PTPα (but not CD45) expression induces dephosphorylation of p59fyn.

Lysates of cells expressing p59fyn in the absence (lane 1) or presence (lane 2) of PTPα were immunoblotted with anti-PTPα (A), anti-p59fyn(B), and anti-phosphotyrosine (C) antibodies, respectively. The cell lysates (300 μg) were incubated with unphosphorylated Src Tyr-527 peptide (D, top panel) or Src Tyr-527 phosphopeptide (bottom panel) coupled to Sepharose beads as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The washed precipitates were immunoblotted with anti-p59fyn antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Whole brain from an adult BALB/c mouse was homogenized in a hand-held Wheaton homogenizer in 6–8 ml of 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Brij 96, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After incubation at 4 °C for 90 min, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and the protein content was determined. For immunoprecipitations, 1 mg of lysate was diluted a further 4-fold in homogenization buffer and then incubated with anti-PTPα (3680, raised against a peptide comprising the C-terminal 18 amino acids of PTPα), anti-p59fyn (FYN3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), or anti-Csk (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) polyclonal antibodies. In some experiments, anti-PTPα antibody 3680 was blocked before immunoprecipitation by preincubation with recombinant purified PTPα-D2 polypeptide (amino acids 485–774) for 45 min at 4 °C. The brain lysate was incubated with the above antibodies for 16 h at 4 °C, and then Protein G PLUS/Protein A-agarose (Calbiochem) was added, and incubation was continued for 60 min at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times each in lysis buffer containing Brij 96 and once in lysis buffer without detergent, resolved by 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were immunoblotted with anti-PTPα antibody 3897 or 3680 followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to peroxidase. Immunoblots were developed using the SuperSignal chemiluminescence system (Pierce). Synthetic peptides with the sequence TSTEPQYQPGENL, representing the sequence surrounding Tyr-527 of pp60c-src, were made using either phosphotyrosine or tyrosine at the appropriate step and were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (Biotechnology Center, National University of Singapore). The phosphopeptide or peptide was covalently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Inc.) and added to 300 μg of whole cell lysates (prepared with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described above) of COS-1 cells transfected with p59fyn cDNA alone or in combination with PTPα cDNA. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the Sepharose beads were washed twice each with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer in the presence and absence of SDS/sodium deoxycholate, respectively, and resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblot analysis was as described above. The kinase assays were performed in 20-μl reactions containing 10 mm Pipes (pH 7.0), 5 mmMnCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm Na3VO4, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 10 min. The reactions were stopped with sample loading buffer, heated at 100 °C for 5 min, resolved by 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and autoradiographed. In experiments where PTP activity was measured, Na3VO4 was omitted from the cell lysis buffer. PTP activity was measured at 30 °C in reactions containing 50 mm Mes (pH 6.0), 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 2.5–5 μmphosphotyrosyl-RR-Src peptide (RRLIEDAEY(P)AARG, corresponding to the sequence encompassing Tyr-416 of pp60c-src and phosphorylated as described (39Lim K.L. Lai D.S.Y. Kalousek M.B. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). The specific activity of the substrate ranged between 3000 and 4000 cpm/pmol of RR-Src. The reaction was carried out for 3 min unless otherwise indicated. The ability of PTPα to dephosphorylate pp60c-src and p59fyn was assessed in COS-1 cells cotransfected with both kinases. Anti-phosphotyrosine probing of p59fyn and pp60c-src immunoprecipitates demonstrated that PTPα expression resulted in tyrosine dephosphorylation of both kinases (Fig. 1, A and B). Blotting of these cell lysates with anti-cst.1, an antibody that recognizes both p59fyn and pp60c-srcequally well (42Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 481-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), showed that similar amounts of these kinases were expressed with PTPα (data not shown). As p59fyn represents a novel potential substrate for PTPα, we characterized the catalytic action of PTPα toward p59fyn in more detail. The extent of p59fyn dephosphorylation increased as increasing amounts of PTPα cDNA were transfected, reaching a plateau of 80–90% tyrosine dephosphorylation (Fig. 2 A). Dephosphorylation was completely dependent on the catalytic activity of PTPα since a PTPα mutant, PTPα(C414S/C704S), in which the essential cysteine residues in the active sites of both catalytic domains of PTPα were mutated to serine residues, was unable to effect p59fyn dephosphorylation (Fig. 2 A). Besides tyrosine dephosphorylation of p59fyn, the coexpression of PTPα resulted in kinase activation of p59fyn. As shown in Fig. 2 B, when p59fyn immunoprecipitates from cells coexpressing PTPα were used in an immunocomplex kinase assay, increasing p59fynautophosphorylation was observed with increasing expression of PTPα. A maximum 5-fold increase in kinase activity was obtained (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5 and 6) at the same PTPα/p59fyn cDNA ratio observed to give maximal p59fyn dephosphorylation (Fig. 2 A). No increase in the kinase activity of p59fyn was measured when catalytically inactive PTPα was expressed with p59fyn (data not shown). Dephosphorylation of the C-terminal tyrosine residue of Src family kinases is linked to kinase activation (5Cartwright C.A. Kaplan P.L. Cooper J.A. Hunter T. Eckhart W. Mol. Cell.

Bolen J.B. Weiss A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 44Bagrodia S. Laudano A.P. Shalloway D J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10247-10251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations support a model of kinase activation where disruption of an intramolecular association between the C-terminal phosphotyrosyl peptide and the SH2 domain of the kinase results in catalytic activation as well as novel interactions of the SH2 domain with other phosphotyrosyl proteins (2Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 3Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The effect of PTPα on p59fyn SH2 domain accessibility was examined by determining the ability of p59fyn to bind to a synthetic phosphopeptide representing the C-terminal Tyr-527 peptide of pp60c-src. This peptide is identical to the C-terminal sequence surrounding Tyr-531 of p59fyn except for the replacement of alanine in position 2 with serine (45Kawakami T. Pennington C.Y. Robbins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4195-4201Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, PTPα-induced dephosphorylation of p59fyn (Fig. 3 C) correlated with a 3-fold increase in the amount of Fyn protein precipitated from cell lysates with the Src Tyr-527 phosphopeptide coupled to Sepharose beads (Fig. 3 D, bottom panel). A control precipitation using an unphosphorylated Src Tyr-527 peptide-Sepharose conjugate contained barely detectable but equivalent amounts of Fyn protein from p59fyn- and PTPα/p59fyn-expressing cells (Fig. 3 D, top panel). While the site(s) of p59fyn dephosphorylation remain to be mapped, the increased p59fyn catalytic activity and SH2 availability for binding are consistent with a PTPα-mediated dephosphorylation of the C-terminal Tyr-531 of p59fyn. To examine whether the PTPα-mediated p59fyn dephosphorylation was a specif"
https://openalex.org/W2065803824,"Two functionally distinct but homologous sites in complement receptor type 1 (CR1) (CD35) were further characterized by homologous substitution mutagenesis of two CR1 derivatives, each containing one site. In both sites, reducing negative and/or increasing positive charge augmented interaction with iC3/C3b and C4b, supporting a role of ionic forces in the binding reaction. In one case, substitution of Asp at the end of complement control protein repeat (CCP) 2 with an Asn transformed the protein, with negligible cofactor activity and iC3 binding, into a mutant with activities similar to native CR1. Consequently, this protein, one-fourth the size of CR1, is a therapeutic candidate for a complement inhibitor. Another important observation is that the residues between two CCPs contribute to activity, probably because they influence positioning of one CCP relative to the next. The initial characterization of the third CCP of an active site led to identification of three peptides necessary for binding. In line with earlier findings for the first two CCPs, interactions with iC3/C3b are similar but not identical to those with C4b, implying overlapping but distinct binding domains. Moreover, changes in cofactor activity usually, but not always, parallel alterations in binding, indicating that these two activities are separable. We also mapped epitopes for a blocking and a function enhancing monoclonal antibody. Their effects can be explained by epitope location. The first antibody binds near functionally important residues. The second may shield inhibitory (negatively charged) residues. These results represent a comprehensive analysis of the active sites of CR1, which is built of modules found in more than 50 mammalian proteins.

Members of the regulators of complement activation protein family are composed entirely or mainly of independently folding complement control protein repeats (CCPs), 1The abbreviations used are: CCP, complement control protein repeat; CA, cofactor activity; CR1, complement receptor type 1; LHR, long homologous repeat; aa, amino acid; S, Sepharose; mAb, monoclonal antibody. each 56–70 aas long (1Hourcade D. Holers V.M. Atkinson J.P. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 45: 381-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The smallest proteins of this multi-gene family, decay-accelerating factor (CD55) and membrane cofactor protein (CD46) have four CCPs, which contain two overlapping active sites, one for C3b and one for C4b (2Coyne K.E. Hall S.E. Thompson E.S. Arce M.A. Kinoshita T. Fujita T. Anstee D.J. Rosse W. Lublin D.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2906-2913PubMed Google Scholar, 3Adams E.M. Brown M.C. Nunge M. Krych M. Atkinson J.P. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3005-3011PubMed Google Scholar). Other proteins of this structurally and functionally related group contain sites multiplied in different ways. Factor H has three binding sites for C3b in a single polypeptide chain composed of 20 CCPs (4Sharma A.K. Pangburn M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10996-11001Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Each site is different, and only one has cofactor activity (CA). Human C4b-binding protein contains seven copies of a single site as a result of joining seven identical protein chains by disulfide bonds (5Chung L.P. Bentley D.R. Reid K.B.M. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Complement receptor type 1 (CR1) (CD35) represents yet another way of increasing the number of active sites. In this case, as a result of internal duplication due to unequal crossing-over or gene conversion (6Klickstein L.B. Bartow T.J. Miletic V. Rabson L.D. Smith J.A. Fearon D.T. J. Exp.

Of 30 CCPs present in the most common allelic form of CR1, all but the two carboxyl-terminal CCPs can be organized into four long homologous repeats (LHRs), termed A, B, C, and D, each seven CCPs long. Regulators of complement activation interact with their ligands via CCPs. In addition to six proteins of the regulators of complement activation family, over 40 other proteins possess CCPs, which in many cases also participate in protein-protein interactions (10Wiles A.P. Shaw G. Bright J. Perczel A. Campbell I.D. Barlow P.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The functions of CR1, namely ligand binding, decay-accelerating activity, and CA, result from the interaction of CCPs with C3b and C4b. Thus, understanding CR1 function requires elucidation of structure-function relationships between CCPs and their ligands. There are two functionally distinct active sites in CR1. Site 1 is located in CCPs 1–3 of LHR A. Site 2 is in CCPs 8–10 of LHR B, and its nearly identical copy (different by only three amino acids (aas)) is in CCPs 15–17 of LHR C. Site 1 binds mainly C4b (6Klickstein L.B. Bartow T.J. Miletic V. Rabson L.D. Smith J.A. Fearon D.T. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1699-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 11Krych M.

The aa sequences of the first two CCPs of site 1 differ by ∼40% from the first two CCPs of site 2, whereas the third CCP in both sites differs by one aa. To analyze by site-directed mutagenesis aas important for function of each site, we used two CR1 derivatives, LHR A, composed of CCPs 1–7, which contain site 1 and LHR B, composed of CCPs 8–14, which carries site 2 (Fig. 1). Previously, by interchanging aas in CCPs 1 and 2 with their homologs in CCPs 8 and 9, respectively, we identified peptides and in some cases aas important for ligand binding and CA (11Krych M. Hourcade D. Atkinson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4353-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12Krych M. Clemenza L. Howdeshell D. Hauhart R. Hourcade D. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13273-13278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, replacement of three short peptides in site 1 led to a markedincrease in ligand binding (11Krych M. Hourcade D. Atkinson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4353-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12Krych M. Clemenza L. Howdeshell D. Hauhart R. Hourcade D. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13273-13278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present report, we determine the aas responsible for this increase and further define the role of aa charge in the binding reaction. Furthermore, because in CR1, three CCPs are indispensable for the activity of each site, we expanded our studies of structure-function relationships to the third CCP. The approach to mutagenesis in this case was based on the observation of Kalli et al. (14Kalli K.R. Hsu P. Bartow T.J. Abearn J.M. Matsumoto A.K. Klickstein L.B. Fearon D.T. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1451-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) that the function of site 2 was abolished if CCP 10 was replaced by CCP 3 of CR2. Therefore, we substituted aas from CCP 10 of CR1 with their homologs from CCP 3 of CR2. Lastly, we mapped epitopes for two mAbs, one of which abrogates activity of both sites and one of which enhances activity of LHR A (site 1). Substitution mutants in the plasmid pSG5 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were made by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using Muta-Gene M13 in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad), MorphTM plasmid DNA mutagenesis kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) or QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Only the first method requires a single stranded vector and a subcloning step. In the other methods, mutagenesis was performed directly in the double-stranded plasmid without subcloning. LHR B was obtained from LHR A by changing aas in CCPs 1–3 into those present in CCPs 8–10 (12Krych M. Clemenza L. Howdeshell D. Hauhart R. Hourcade D. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13273-13278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ΔCCP 1, lacking aas 1–60, and ΔCCP 2, lacking aas 61–122, were described earlier (11Krych M. Hourcade D. Atkinson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4353-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The construct consisting of CCPs 1–3 was made by replacing the 195th aa (the fourth position after the last Cys of CCP 3) in the protein LHR A with a stop codon. The construct composed of CCPs 8–10 was made by replacing the 645th aa (the fourth position after the last Cys of CCP 10) in the protein LHR B with a stop codon. The strategy for homologous substitution mutagenesis of CCPs 1 and 2 in LHR A was described previously (11Krych M. Hourcade D. Atkinson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4353-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12Krych M. Clemenza L. Howdeshell D. Hauhart R. Hourcade D. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13273-13278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is shown in Fig. 2. The strategy for mutagenesis of CCP 10 was based on the observation that binding and CA of site 2 were abrogated when CCP 10 was replaced with CCP 3 of CR2 (14Kalli K.R. Hsu P. Bartow T.J. Abearn J.M. Matsumoto A.K. Klickstein L.B. Fearon D.T. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1451-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, to identify functionally important residues in CCP 10, aas were mutated, a few at a time, into their homologs in CCP 3 of CR2 (see Fig. 4). CR1 cDNA in AprM8, obtained from Lloyd Klickstein (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), served as a template for PCR amplification of the signal peptide and of CCPs 15–21 (LHR C). 5′ primer for amplification of the signal peptide ATA TAC AGA TCT ATG GGA GCC TCT TCT CCA AGA introduces an upstream BglII site (underlined) for cloning to the expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene). The 3′ primer ACA GTG ACC TAG GCC CCA TGC AAC TGG TAG CGC AAG CA introduces five silent mutations to generate an AvrII site (underlined) for ligation to LHR C and to disrupt GC rich stretches. For amplification of LHR C, the 5′ primer ATA TCT ATC ATC CTA GGT CAC TGT CAA GCA CCA was used. It includes codons for four aas between the last cysteine of CCP 14 and the first cysteine of CCP 15. Due to three silent substitutions, it creates an AvrII site (underlined) and interrupts sequence of four C nucleotides. The 3′ primer for LHR C, AAT ATT ATA GAT CTT TAA CCA GCA CGA ACA GAA AGT TC, includes codons for five out of six amino acids between the last cysteine of CCP 21 and the first cysteine of CCP 22, followed by a translation stop codon and BglII site (underlined). Each PCR product was subcloned into TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), sequenced and cut out with AvrII and BglII. The signal peptide and LHR C fragments were then ligated throughAvrII site, and the ligation product was cloned into BglII site of pSG5. Plasmids with cDNA encoding CR1 derivatives were transfected into COS 7 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's procedure. Twenty-four h after the transfection, cells were washed and Opti-MEM I medium without serum was added to avoid possible CA in bovine serum. After 48–72 h of incubation, supernatants were collected, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C until use. A modification of the previously described procedure was used (12Krych M. Clemenza L.

To 200 μl of iC3-Sepharose (iC3-S) or C4b-Sepharose (C4b-S), medium (1 ml) from transfected cells containing a CR1 derivative was added after adjusting the salt and protein concentration. Following a 30-min incubation at room temperature with occasional mixing, the columns were washed with 850 μl of appropriately diluted PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, and the proteins bound to iC3-S or C4b-S were eluted with 1 ml of 300 mm NaCl containing 1% Nonidet P-40. The levels of CR1 derivatives in the eluates were determined by sandwich ELISA using mAb 3D9 (17O'Shea J.J. Brown E.J. Seligmann B.E. Metcalf J.A. Frank M.M. Gallin J.I. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 2580-2587PubMed Google Scholar)-coated wells and mAb E11 (a gift from Ronald Taylor, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA) (18Hogg N. Ross G.D.

For quantification of the mutants not recognized by 3D9, a rabbit polyclonal antibody to human CR1 (19Makrides S.C. Scesney S.M. Ford P.J. Evans K.S. Carson G.R. Marsh Jr., H.C. J. Biol.

Results are expressed as a percentage of CR1 derivative bound to iC3-S or C4b-S of that initially offered to the Sepharose. Effect of mAb 8C9.1 (a gift from Henry Marsh, T Cell Sciences, Inc., Needham, MA) on ligand binding was analyzed in the binding assay described above. The medium containing the CR1 derivative and the mAb (1 μg/ml) was added to the Sepharose affinity columns. The 8C9.1 epitope was mapped by ELISA in which wells were coated with 3D9. Bound LHR A derivatives were then detected with biotinylated 8C9.1 followed by horseradish peroxidase conjugated to extravidin (Sigma). The reduced binding (to mutants 14e and 15a) was assessed by comparing the results of this assay with our standard ELISA, which uses E11 as a detection antibody. The 3D9 epitope was mapped by standard ELISA in which wells were coated with 3D9 and E11 was used to detect bound proteins. The reduced binding (to mutants 20d and 22a) was measured by comparing these results with those in which wells were coated with polyclonal antibody and E11 served as a detection antibody. C3b and C4b (Advanced Research Technologies, San Diego, CA) were biotinylated by incubating 125 μg of C3b or C4b with 3.4 μg of NHS-LC biotin (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature followed by removal of unincorporated biotin on Microcon 30 microconcentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Biotinylated C3b or C4b (250 ng) was mixed with 50 ng of factor I (Advanced Research Technologies) and with medium from transfected cells containing 0.002 pmol of a CR1 derivative in 25 mm NaCl. The cofactor protein was limiting reagent in this assay system. A negative control containing all components except factor I was always included. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h in the case of C3b and for 16 h in the case of C4b, the samples were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (Novex, San Diego, CA) followed by a transfer of the proteins to Immun-Lite membranes using a Bio-Rad semidry transfer apparatus. The biotinylated proteins were incubated with extravidin-horseradish peroxidase and visualized using the Supersignal chemiluminescent-horseradish peroxidase substrate system (Pierce). The three initial CCPs of LHRs A, B, and C are functional if attached to irrelevant CCPs of CR1 or to an unrelated protein (6Klickstein L.B. Bartow T.J. Miletic V. Rabson L.D. Smith J.A. Fearon D.T.

The specificity of binding was identical to the parental proteins in that CCPs 1–3 bound C4b and CCPs 8–10 bound C4b and C3b. Ligand binding was reduced by 10–30% 2Percentage of binding refers to the fraction of a CR1 derivative offered to iC3-S or C4b-S that bound to it. as compared with their parental proteins LHR A and LHR B. For example, at 25 mm NaCl, a 30% decrease was observed because 80% of LHR B versus 50% of CCPs 8–10 bound to the iC3-S. This result is consistent with the data of Kalli et al. (14Kalli K.R. Hsu P.

Med. 1991; 174: 1451-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), who showed that the presence of CCP 11 (i.e. binding of a construct bearing CCPs 8–10 versus one with CCPs 8–11) increased the affinity of site 2 for C3b. Previously, we reported that binding and CA of mutants 14 and 15 (see Fig. 2) were substantially increased relative to the parental protein LHR A and were similar to those of LHR B (12Krych M. Clemenza L. Howdeshell D. Hauhart R. Hourcade D. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13273-13278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify residues responsible for this increase, mutants with single amino acid changes were constructed within the context of LHR A (Fig. 2 and Table I). The 20–47% binding of the mutants represented a modest (3–30%) increase over the 17% binding of LHR A. None of them, however, approached the 86% binding of mutant 14. The effect on C4b binding was similar in that there was a 6–23% increase in binding for individual mutantsversus a 42% increase for mutant 14 (Table I). Of the single aa substitutions, T14K (mutant 14c) augmented binding of iC3 and C4b the most. CA for C3b and C4b was increased in mutant 14a but not detectably changed in mutants 14b-j (not shown). For mutant 15, the change of N29K (mutation 15b) accounted for all of the enhanced iC3 and C4b binding (Table I) and CA for C3b and C4b (not shown) observed in mutant 15. The other mutation, Y27S (mutant 15a), had no effect (TableI).Table IAmino acids responsible for increase in ligand binding by mutants 14 and 15ConstructBinding1-2001iC3 binding was performed at 12.5, 25, and 100 mm NaCl.

Howdeshell D. Hauhart R. Hourcade D. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13273-13278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that iC3 and C4b binding of mutant 10 was also substantially increased, individual residues were altered. Substitution of Asp109 with Asn within the context of LHR A (mutant 10a) caused a marked enhancement of iC3 and C4b binding, above that of LHR B and to a level similar to that of soluble CR1 (Fig. 3). Also, CA for C4b and C3b was similar to that for LHR B (not shown). The other three single aa mutations in region 10 produced minimal or no change in binding or CA (not shown). That changing Asp to Asn caused a major effect suggested a role for the amide group. To test this further, Asp109 was changed to Gln because, like Asn, Gln has the amide group, but Gln is larger. Two other replacements of Asp109 were made with aas of a similar size, namely nonpolar Val and polar Thr. The iC3 binding capability of all three mutants at 25 mm NaCl was intermediate (41–49%) between binding of LHR A (12%) and 10a (91%) (Fig. 3). A greater effect of Asn as compared with Val or Thr is consistent with the critical role of the amide. Because Asn leads to higher binding than does Gln, the size of the aa may play a role as well. Finally, the low binding of the wild type protein (LHR A) suggests that negative charge inhibits the interaction with iC3. For C4b binding, each of the four substitutions for Asp109led to an increase above the level of LHR A but none had as dramatic an effect as did Asn on iC3 binding (not shown). Of 20 mAbs to CR1 tested (20Nickells M. Hauhart R. Krych M. Bala Subramanian V. Geoghegan-Barek K. Marsh Jr., H. Atkinson J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1998; 112: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), 8C9.1 was the only one specific for LHR A, suggesting that its epitope is in CCP 1 or 2. By testing LHR A with CCP 1 or 2 deleted, we localized the 8C9.1 epitope to CCP 1 (Table II). To map the epitope more precisely, we employed the substitution mutants in CCP 1 and found that sequences 14 and 15 are necessary for 8C9.1 binding (Table II). Further mapping, using single aa mutants in sequences 14 and 15, demonstrated that mutations 14b, c, d, and h and 15b abrogate 8C9.1 binding, whereas mutations 14e and 15a significantly reduce it (to less than 20% relative to E11; Table II). An unusual feature of this mAb is that it enhances binding by LHR A. At 25 mm, the mAb caused an increase in iC3 binding from 4 to 30%, whereas C4b binding was augmented from 27 to 60%.Table IILocalization of 8C9.1 epitope in CCP 1Construct8C9.1 binding2-2001+, binding equivalent to E11; +/−, <20% of E11 binding; −, no detectable binding.

Mutants 20 and 22 had barely detectable iC3 and C4b binding ability, whereas mutant 19 had markedly reduced iC3 binding (Fig. 5). A comparison of binding and CA results (Tables IV and V) indicates that they do not always coincide. For example, mutants 16, 17, and 19 bound C4b similarly to parental protein LHR B but lacked (mutants 16 and 17) or had minimal (mutant 19) CA for C4b. In mutant 16, C3b binding was largely preserved, but CA was considerably diminished.Table IIISummary of iC3 binding and CA for mutants in CCP 10ConstructiC3 binding3-2001Experiments were performed twice at 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mm NaCl.

Within sequence 20, mutation 20c, Y596P, produced a marked (about 60–70% at 50 mm) reduction of both iC3 and C4b binding.

Within region 19, mutations T589E (19a) and R591V (19b) reduced iC3 binding (TableIII). The presence of Pro in position 22a (Fig. 4) in LHRs A, B, and C but not in LHR D suggested that it might be important.

In this report, the p53-null human leukemia HL60 cells were used to investigate phosphorylation and degradation of lamin B during apoptosis. We found that lamin B was phosphorylated within 1 h after addition of the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin, and that lamin B phosphorylation preceded lamin B degradation and DNA fragmentation. Using a cell-free system we also found that cytosol from camptothecin-treated cells induced lamin B phosphorylation and degradation in isolated nuclei from untreated HL60 cells. Lamin B phosphorylation was prevented by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) but not by the Cdc2 inhibitor, flavopiridol. Phosphorylation of lamin B was inhibited by immunodepletion of PKCα from activated cytosol and was restored by addition of purified PKCα. PKCα activity also increased rapidly as lamin B was phosphorylated after initiation of the apoptotic response in HL60 cells. These data suggest that lamin B is phosphorylated by PKCα and proteolyzed before DNA fragmentation in HL60 cells undergoing apoptosis.

The nuclear lamins are karyophilic proteins located at the nucleoplasmic surface of the inner nuclear membrane where they assemble in a polymeric structure referred to as the nuclear lamina (for review, see Refs. 1Gerace L.

Lamins belong to the family of intermediate filaments, which share a tripartite organization consisting of a central α-helical rod domain of conserved size, flanked by N- and C-terminal non-α-helical end domains of variable size and sequence (see Fig. 9). The lamina has been suggested to serve as a major chromatin anchoring site of nuclear scaffold-associated regions during interphase and possibly to be involved in organizing higher order chromatin domains. The lamina is a dynamic structure regulated by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation by p34cdc2 kinase is key to the dissolution of the nuclear lamina during mitosis. Other lamin kinases include mitogen-associated protein kinases, c-AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, c-AMP-dependent protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; CPT, camptothecin; UCN-01, 7-hydroxystaurosporine; DCI, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and protein kinase C (PKC) (1Gerace L.

Major PKC phosphorylation sites have been mapped to serine residues located in close proximity to the nuclear localization signal in the C-terminal non-α-helical region, and phosphorylation of these residues interferes with the nuclear transport of lamin B (2Nigg E.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The p34cdc2 phosphorylation sites are on both sides of the central α-helical rod domain. While many mammalian cells contains three distinct lamins (lamins A, B, and C), human leukemia HL60 cells express primarily lamin B (4Fields A.P. Pettit G.R. May W.S. J. Biol.

Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8395-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 15Duan H. Orth K.

Interestingly, recent observations demonstrated that overexpression of mutant lamins A or B resistant to caspase cleavage delayed DNA fragmentation, suggesting that lamin cleavage participates in the activation of DNA fragmentation and nuclear apoptosis (14Rao L. Perez D. White E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1441-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Thus, lamins are presently the only known caspase substrates known to be directly involved in the execution phase of apoptosis. Protein phosphorylation is probably important to regulate apoptosis (22Gjertsen B.T. Doskeland S.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1269: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For instance, unscheduled activation of p34cdc2 kinase, one of the lamin kinases (2Nigg E.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), is associated with cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated apoptosis (23Shi L. Nishioka W.K. Th'ng J. Bradbury E.M. Litchfield D.W.

Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 228-231PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated lamin B phosphorylation and degradation during apoptosis in response to camptothecin in HL60 cells and in a previously described cell-free system (6Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1997; 11: 1238-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Bertrand R. Solary E. Kohn K.W. O'Connor P. Pommier Y. Exp.

Both caspases and the nuclear scaffold-associated serine protease have been suggested as candidate proteases (28Zhivotovsky B. Gahm A. Orrenius S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

CPT, 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01), and flavopiridol were obtained from the NCI Drug Chemistry and Synthesis Branch. Drugs were freshly dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10 mm and further diluted in water prior to each experiment. Radiolabeled precursor [14C]thymidine (53.6 mCi/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products and [32P]orthophosphate was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 3,4-Dichloroisocoumarin (DCI) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. All other chemicals were of reagent grade and purchased from Sigma or other local sources. Anti-lamin B monoclonal antibody from mouse (101-B7) was purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA) and anti-protein kinase Cα (anti-PKCα) polyclonal antibodies from rabbit was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-PKC monoclonal antibody 1.9 and recombinant PKCα from baculovirus were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunogloblin secondary antibody was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells were grown in suspension culture in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. For filter elution assays, HL60 cells were incubated with [14C]thymidine for 1-doubling time (about 24 h). Cell cultures were then washed with fresh medium twice and chased in isotope-free medium overnight before drug treatment. Unless otherwise indicated, camptothecin treatments were with 5 μm. For in vivo phosphorylation, HL60 cells were washed twice in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, resuspended in the same medium and incubated with 250 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate/107 cells. Following 1-h incubation, the 32P-labeled cells were washed twice and resuspended in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 with dialyzed serum for 30 min prior to drug treatment. We followed our previously published procedure (25Bertrand R. Solary E. Kohn K.W. O'Connor P. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 26Solary E. Bertrand R. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Blood. 1993; 81: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, untreated and treated cells (5 μmcamptothecin for 3 h) were spun down, rinsed three times in cold PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), and resuspended at a density of approximately 107 cells/ml in nucleus buffer (1 mm KH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm AEBSF, 0.15 unit/ml aprotinin, 1.0 mmNa3VO4, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol), including 0.3% Triton X-100. After incubation at 4 °C for 10 min and gentle agitation, cellular mixes were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min, rinsed once by centrifugation/resuspension in nucleus buffer without Triton X-100, and used as nuclei suspensions at a density of 1–2 × 107nuclei/ml. Supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 10 min and used as cytosol. [14C]Thymidine-labeled cells were used to prepare nuclei for filter elution assay. DNA fragmentation related to apoptosis was measured by filter elution as described previously (25Bertrand R. Solary E. Kohn K.W. O'Connor P. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 30Bertrand R. Kohn K.W. Solary E. Pommier Y. Drug Dev. Res. 1995; 34: 138-144Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction mixtures were deposited onto protein-adsorbing filters (Metricel, Gelman Science, Ann Harbor, MI) and washed with 3 ml of nucleus buffer. This fraction (W) was collected. Lysis was performed with 5 ml of LS10 (2 m NaCl, 0.04 m Na2EDTA, 0.2% Sarkosyl, pH 10) followed by washing with 5 ml of 0.02 mm Na2EDTA, pH 10. The lysis (L) and EDTA (E) fractions were collected. All fractions (W, L, and E) and filters (F) were counted by liquid scintillation. DNA fragmentation was calculated as the percent of DNA eluting from the filter as: percent DNA fragmentation = 100 × (W + L + E)/(W + L + E + F). All experiments were repeated at least two or three times. After drug treatment, cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in reducing loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6 m urea, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.003% bromphenol blue, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) and sonicated for 20 s. The lysates containing 2.5 × 105 cells were heated at 65 °C for 15 min and then loaded in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (precast gel from NOVEX, San Diego, CA). After electrophoresis, proteins were electrophoretically transferred from the gels to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P from Millipore Co., Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Membranes were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in the primary antibody solutions after blocking in 5% non-fat dry milk solution for 1 h, followed by 1-h incubation with secondary antibody. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce). After drug treatment,32P-labeled HL60 cells (107 cells/sample) were washed in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium without serum once, and the cell pellets were lysed in buffer A (PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm AEBSF, 4 units/ml aprotinin, and 1% bovine serum albumin) with 0.4% SDS before sonication. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,500 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatants were mixed with 1.5 μg of anti-human lamin B antibody and 20% protein G-Sepharose suspensions in lysis buffer followed by overnight mixing at 4 °C. At the end of incubation, the immune complex was washed in buffer A and buffer A without bovine serum albumin. The immune complex was boiled for 10 min after adding 3 × SDS loading buffer. Samples were analyzed in 12% SDS-PAGE. Protein gels were dried up and subjected to autoradiography after being dried up. The nuclei from untreated HL60 cells (1.5 × 106 nuclei) were incubated with cytosol in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation, buffer A supplemented with 0.4% SDS was added to the samples before brief sonication. Afterward the procedures were the same as for in vivo lamin B phosphorylation. After drug treatment, cells (107cells/sample) were harvested, washed in cold PBS once, and resuspended in 340 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmAEBSF) followed by 30-min incubation on ice. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 14,500 rpm for 30 min and incubated with protein G-Sepharose and 1 μg of anti-PKCα at 4 °C for 2 h to make PKC immunoprecipitates. The Sepharose beads associated with immunoprecipitates were washed in lysis buffer three times and twice in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm AEBSF, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA). The washed beads were incubated with reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 μm ATP, 0.4 μg/ml histone H1, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) in the presence of 1.2 mm CaCl2, 40 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 3.3 μm dioleylglycerol at 30 °C for 10 min. After the incubation, 3 × SDS loading buffer was added to stop the kinase reaction and samples were boiled for 10 min. Samples were run on 12% SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated histone H1 bands were analyzed by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Anti-PKCα antibody was incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation. After removal of the supernatant, the beads were washed once with nucleus buffer and incubated with cytosol from CPT-treated cells (CPT-cytosol:antibody = 5:1 (v/v)) overnight in a rotator at 4 °C. The beads were subsequently pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was subjected to immunoblotting for PKCα and was used as CPT-cytosol immunodepleted of PKCα. Mock-depleted CPT-cytosol was made just using nuclei buffer to replace antibody. HL60 cells are remarkably sensitive to various apoptotic stimuli, including chemotherapeutic DNA-damaging agents (5Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5870-5878PubMed Google Scholar, 31Bertrand R. Solary E. Jenkins J. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) such as the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin, protein kinase inhibitors (25Bertrand R. Solary E. Kohn K.W. O'Connor P. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 32Shao R.G. Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the Golgi poison, brefeldin A (33Shao R.G. Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous studies (31Bertrand R. Solary E. Jenkins J. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), Fig. 1 A shows that camptothecin induces apoptotic DNA fragmentation in HL60 cells with rapid kinetics. Lamin B protein was cleaved with similar kinetics as the DNA fragmentation, yielding two cleavage bands (Fig. 1 B) corresponding to 45- and 32-kDa polypeptides that were detected 3 h after the beginning of drug treatment. Since phosphorylation is critical for modulating lamin stability and the nuclear and chromatin structure both in mitosis and interphase (2Nigg E.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we studied lamin B phosphorylation during apoptosis in HL60 cells. As shown in Fig. 2, phosphorylation of the 69-kDa lamin B polypeptide increased rapidly during camptothecin treatment. Three hours after the beginning of treatment, the 32-kDa lamin B cleavage product was also phosphorylated (Fig. 2 A). These results indicate that lamin B phosphorylation occurs early during apoptosis and is associated with its degradation. We next used a cell-free system that we previously established to demonstrate the role of serine proteases in triggering apoptotic DNA fragmentation (25Bertrand R. Solary E. Kohn K.W. O'Connor P. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 26Solary E. Bertrand R. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Blood. 1993; 81: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous results, the cytosol from apoptotic HL60 cells induced DNA fragmentation in nuclei from untreated HL60 cells (Fig. 3 A). Cytosol from apoptotic cells also cleaved lamin B from naive nuclei to a 45-kDa product (Fig. 3 B). Lamin B phosphorylation was then studied in the cell-free system after incubation of nuclei suspensions with cytosols from apoptotic or control cells in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. After immunoprecipitation with anti-lamin B antibody, samples were run on SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated lamin B was analyzed by autoradiography and PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Fig. 4 shows that cytosol from apoptotic cells enhanced lamin B phosphorylation. We observed previously that DNA fragmentation induced by apoptotic cytosol could be inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor DCI (6Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1997; 11: 1238-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows while DCI blocked DNA fragmentation induced by CPT, lamin B cleavage also was abolished. The result suggested that serine protease activation was required for both DNA fragmentation and lamin B degradation. We next asked whether lamin B phosphorylation could be inhibited by DCI. Fig. 5 Cshows that lamin B phosphorylation was not affected by DCI. This finding suggests that protease activation does not affect lamin B phosphorylation. Cyclin B/Cdc2 (p34cdc2) kinase is critical for lamin depolymerization during mitosis (2Nigg E.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We found that flavopiridol, a potent Cdk inhibitor (35Carlson B. Dubay M.M. Sausville E.A. Brizuela L. Worland P.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2973-2978PubMed Google Scholar, 36De Azevedo Jr., W.F. Mueller-Dieckmann H.J. Schulze-Gahmen U. Worland P.J. Sausville E. Kim S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2735-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) could not inhibit lamin B phosphorylation induced by cytosol from apoptotic cells even at high concentrations (100 μm) (Fig. 6 A). We also found that flavopiridol had not effect on either DNA fragmentation or lamin B cleavage in the cell-free system (Fig. 6, B and C). These observations suggested that p34cdc2 kinase was not responsible for phosphorylation of lamin B by the apoptotic cytosol. Protein kinase C has also been shown to phosphorylate lamin B in interphase cells (37Collas P. Thompson L. Fields A.P. Poccia D.L. Courvalin J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21274-21280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We first used the PKC inhibitor UCN-01 (38Takahashi I. Kobayashi E. Asano K. Yoshida M. Nakano H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1987; 40: 1782-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) to test whether lamin B phosphorylation during apoptosis is related to PKC. Fig. 7 A shows that lamin B phosphorylation was inhibited by UCN-01 in a dose-dependent manner. An anti-PKC monoclonal antibody, which acts near the active site of PKC and inhibits PKC activity by more than 80% (39Mochly-Rosen D. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2291-2297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used next. This antibody strongly suppressed lamin B phosphorylation induced by apoptotic cytosol. Recombinant PKCα restored lamin B phosphorylation (Fig. 7 B). A third type of experiment was performed to test whether lamin B phosphorylation in apoptotic cells extracts could be linked to PKCα. Fig. 7 C shows that after immunodepletion of PKCα from apoptotic cytosol, lamin B phosphorylation was reduced by about 90%. The efficiency of the immunodepletion was tested (Fig. 7 C, lower panel) and showed that under these condition PKCα protein levels were almost undetectable. Together, the results shown in Fig. 7 suggested that PKCα was critical for lamin B phosphorylation by cytosol from apoptotic HL60 cells. A recent study showed that PKCα is activated in cytosol from apoptotic HL60 cells (40Shao R.G. Cao C.X. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31321-31325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Now we tested whether camptothecin also induces PKCα activation in whole HL60 cells. As shown in Fig. 8, PKCα activity increased rapidly during the first hour after the beginning of camptothecin treatment. The present study is the first report of lamin B phosphorylation during apoptosis. We found that lamin B is phosphorylated within 1 h after the addition of the apoptotic inducer (camptothecin) and that lamin B phosphorylation persists for several hours as lamin B is being cleaved, and DNA fragmentation and complete apoptosis take place (31Bertrand R. Solary E. Jenkins J. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Various kinases are involved in lamin phosphorylation, including p34cdc2 kinase, mitogen-associated kinase, PKC, PKA (2Nigg E.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In particular, in mitosis, Cdc2 kinase is believed to play a critical role in lamin phosphorylation and thus disassembly of lamin polymers (2Nigg E.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 41Nigg E.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 261-270PubMed Google Scholar). The present data suggest that PKC is critical for lamin B phosphorylation in HL60 cell during apoptosis for the following reasons. First, the PKC inhibitor, UCN-01 (38Takahashi I. Kobayashi E. Asano K. Yoshida M. Nakano H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1987; 40: 1782-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 42Seynaeve C.M. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Sausville E.A. Worland P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1207-1214PubMed Google Scholar) effectively blocked the lamin kinasein vitro, while the cyclin kinase inhibitor flavopiridol (35Carlson B. Dubay M.M. Sausville E.A. Brizuela L. Worland P.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2973-2978PubMed Google Scholar) was inactive. Second, lamin B phosphorylation was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody directed against the active site of PKC. Third, immunodepletion of apoptotic cell extracts with anti-PKC antibody inhibited lamin B phosphorylation, while addition of excess PKC restored lamin B phosphorylation. Fourth and finally, total PKCα activity increased at the time of lamin B phosphorylation (40Shao R.G. Cao C.X. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31321-31325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The lamin B protein kinase C phosphorylation sites have been mapped to serines 395 and 405 in HL60 cells following PKC activation by bryostatin (43Hocevar B.A. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7545-7552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 9). These sites are adjacent to the highly conserved central α-helical rod domain, which is thought to be responsible for the formation of a highly stable coiled-coil dimer between two lamin molecules. It is also next to the nuclear translocation signal sequence (NLS) (Fig. 9). In the case of chicken lamin B2, phosphorylation by PKC in this region has been shown to alter recognition of this sequence and block nuclear import of newly synthesized lamin polypeptides (2Nigg E.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recently, PKC-mediated lamin B phosphorylation during interphase has been shown to promote lamin B solubilization and nuclear lamina disassembly (37Collas P. Thompson L. Fields A.P. Poccia D.L. Courvalin J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21274-21280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, PKC-mediated lamin B phosphorylation during apoptosis is likely to affect nuclear and chromatin structure. Proteolytic lamin degradation is a common and probably functionally important biochemical feature of apoptosis. It has been observed in all the apoptotic cell systems described to date, including HL60 cells treated with chemotherapeutic agents (5Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5870-5878PubMed Google Scholar, 6Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1997; 11: 1238-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 34Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), activation-driven cell death of T cells (44Ucker D.S. Meyers J. Obermiller P.S. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1583-1592PubMed Google Scholar), thymocyte apoptosis (9Neamati N. Fernandez A. Wright S. Kiefer J. McConkey D.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3788-3795PubMed Google Scholar), and serum starvation inras transformed embryo cells (11Oberhammer F.A. Hochegger K. Froschl G. Tiefenbacher R. Pavelka M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Lamin degradation has also been reported in apoptosis induced by drICE in insect cells (45Fraser A.G. McCarthy N.J. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6192-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent study of Rao et al. (14Rao L. Perez D. White E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1441-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) demonstrated that overexpression of lamin A or B delayed nuclear apoptosis and DNA fragmentation in the case of p53-dependent apoptosis in rodent cells. These observations suggest that lamin cleavage plays an active role in the execution phase of apoptosis. Caspase 6 (Mch-2) has been shown to cleave lamin A at the conserved aspartic residue at position 230 (13Takahashi A. Alnemri E.S. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8395-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 14Rao L. Perez D. White E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1441-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), and the corresponding lamin B cleavage site has been mapped to Asp231 (14Rao L. Perez D. White E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1441-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). This site is located in the conserved α-helical rod domain (Fig. 9), and its cleavage would produce two polypeptides of 40.3 and 25.9 kDa, respectively. The observed 45-kDa fragment has been shown to correspond to the predicted 40.3 fragment (13Takahashi A. Alnemri E.S. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8395-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 14Rao L. Perez D. White E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1441-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Another candidate lamin protease is the nuclear scaffold protease (46Clawson G.A. Norbeck L.L. Hatem C.L. Rhodes C. Amiri P. McKerrow J.H. Patierno S.R. Fiskum G. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 827-838PubMed Google Scholar), which would be expected to cleave lamin B at tyrosine 377 and to yield two polypeptides of 43.2 and 23 kDa, respectively (Fig. 9). Therefore, it is possible that serine proteases (6Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1997; 11: 1238-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) might also be involved in lamin B cleavage during apoptosis to produce the 32-kDa lamin B fragment that we observed in addition to the 45-kDa polypeptide in apoptotic HL60 cells. Since the observed sizes indicate that cleavage of lamin B during apoptosis occurs in the conserved α-helical rod domain, which is essential for lamin dimerization (Fig. 9), it is likely that lamin B cleavage should promote the dissolution of the nuclear lamina and affect nuclear condensation. This recent conclusion is consistent with the works of Rao et al. (14Rao L. Perez D. White E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1441-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and Lazebnik et al. (12Lazebnik Y.A. Takahashi A. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9042-9046Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), demonstrating an impairment of apoptotic chromatin condensation upon inhibition of lamin proteolysis. Chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation might be related to the important function of the nuclear lamina as an anchorage structure for the chromatin scaffold-associated regions, which would organize the chromatin loop structures. Thus, it is possible that chromatin release from the nuclear lamina might facilitate the activity of nucleases and the cleavage and release of chromatin loops during apoptosis."

Herein we identify a new thi operon,thiBPQ (designated sfuABC in Escherichia coli), required for the transport of thiamine and TPP into the cell. Insertions in the operon result in strains that are phenotypically and biochemically defective in thiamine and TPP transport. Data presented herein show that this operon is transcriptionally repressed in the presence of exogenous thiamine, with TPP the likely regulatory molecule.

Despite its importance in cellular physiology, neither the de novo biosynthetic pathway nor the salvage systems for thiamine are fully understood in any organism. Thiamine monophosphate (TMP) is generated by the condensation of two independently synthesized moieties: 4-amino-5-hydroxy-methyl pyrimidine pyrophosphate (HMP-PP) and 4-methyl-5-(β-hydroxyethyl) thiazole phosphate (THZ-P). TMP is then phosphorylated by the action of thiamine monophosphate kinase, ThiL (1Webb E. Downs D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15702-15707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), to form the physiologically relevant form of the vitamin, TPP. Recently several studies in the enteric bacteria S. typhimurium and Escherichia coli have elucidated many steps in the formation of thiamine (2Begley T.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1996; 13: 178-186Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 3Webb E. Claas K. Downs D. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4399-4402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Petersen L.A. Downs D.M. J.

Soc. 1995; 117: 2351-2352Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but much of the pathway remains unknown. Mutants defective in various steps in de novo synthesis can be supplemented exogenously with THZ, HMP, thiamine, TMP, or TPP. These results suggested that S. typhimurium had the ability to take up and incorporate these compounds into the de novothiamine biosynthetic pathway. It was demonstrated several years ago that thiamine was actively transported in E. coli, and this transport was shown to involve a thiamine-binding protein whose activity was repressed by excess thiamine (6Iwashima A. Matsuura A. Nose Y. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 1419-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kawasaki T. Esaki K. Arch. Biochem.

The transport of TPP was not addressed in these previous studies. The presence of the thiamine-binding protein led to the hypothesis that thiamine was transported via a periplasmic binding protein-dependent ABC-type transporter (10Boos W. Lucht J.M. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1175-1209Google Scholar). We report here the identification of an operon (thiBPQ) at centisome (Cs) 1.5 on the S. typhimurium and E. coli chromosomes involved in the specific translocation of thiamine and its phosphoesters across the inner membrane. Analysis of the E. coli sequence (designated sfuABC) in addition to phenotypic analysis in S. typhimurium suggested that thiBPQ encoded thiamine binding protein, inner membrane channel, and energy-transducing ATPase, respectively. Transcriptional fusions in this operon were regulated in response to exogenous thiamine. All strains used in this study are derivatives of S. typhimurium LT2 and are listed in Table I.

Open table in a new tab No-carbon source E media (NCE) supplemented with 1 mm MgSO4 and 11 mm glucose was used as minimal media (13Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980: 207Google Scholar, 14Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Difco nutrient broth (NB, 8 g/liter) with NaCl (5 g/liter) added was used as rich medium. Difco BiTek agar (15 g/liter) was added for solid medium. Antibiotics were added as needed to the following concentrations in rich and minimal media respectively: kanamycin (50, 125 μg/ml), tetracycline (20, 10 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (40, 4 μg/ml). Radiolabeled thiamine (C2-14C-THZ-thiamine) with a specific activity of 24 mCi/mmol was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Arlington Heights, IL). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. All transductional crosses were performed by using the high frequency transducing bacteriophage P22 mutant HT 105/1 int-201 (15Schmieger H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 119: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) as described (16Downs D.M. Petersen L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4858-4864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transductants were purified and identified as phage-free by cross-streaking on green plates (17Chan R.K. Botstein T. Watanabe T. Ogata Y. Virology. 1972; 50: 883-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Strains defective for TPP transport were isolated by insertional mutagenesis with one of two transposons, Tn10d(Tc) or MudJ. To facilitate mutant isolation, a pool of cells containing >80,000 independent insertions was generated as described elsewhere (18Hughes K.T. Roth J.R. Genetics. 1985; 109: 263-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kleckner J. Roth J.R. Botstein D. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 125-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). A P22 lysate was grown on these cells to generate either a MudJ or Tn10d(Tc) phage pool. To isolate Tn10d(Tc) insertion mutants, the Tn10d(Tc) phage pool described above was used to transduce a strain defective in de novo thiamine synthesis (either DM62 (thi-924::MudJ) or DM460 (thiH910::MudJ)) to tetracycline resistance (Tcr) on NB-tetracycline plates. The Tcrtransductants were screened for those that were able to grow with 1 μm thiamine but not 1 μm TPP. Putative insertion mutants defective in high affinity TPP transport (defining the thiP locus) were streaked for phage sensitivity and saved for further analysis. Point mutations defective in high affinity TPP transport were isolated as described above with the following exception. The Tn10d(Tc) pool utilized had been mutagenized with hydroxylamine as described (13Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980: 207Google Scholar, 20Hong J.S. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3158-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), resulting in the isolation of point mutations linked to a Tn10d(Tc) element. After mapping, MudJ insertions in the thiP locus were identified using co-transduction with the leu locus in strain DM3616 (Δleu-485thiH942::Tn10d(Tc)) and the MudJ pool described above. Isolation of MudJ insertions linked to the thiP locus Tn10d(Tc) in strain DM3340 (thi-935::Tn10(d)thi-995Δ) utilized a positive screen, as described (19Kleckner J. Roth J.R. Botstein D. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 125-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). One highly linked insertion, DM3403 (zac-8602::MudJ thi-995 Δ) (97%), was saved for further analysis. DNA was sequenced at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center-Nucleic Acid and Protein Facility. DNA sequence analysis program BLAST (21Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69694) Google Scholar) was used to compare this sequence with known sequences from the data base. The TPP transport-deficient mutations were mapped on the S. typhimurium chromosome via sequencing MudQ phage DNA from strain DM3468 (zac-8602::MudQ thi-995Δ) which had been generated from strain DM3403 (zac-8602::MudJ thi-995 Δ) as described (22Youderian P. Sugiono P. Brewer K.L. Higgins N.P. Elliot T. Genetics. 1988; 118: 581-592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting locked-in P22 phage was induced, and DNA was isolated as described (23Benson N.P. Goldman B.S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1673-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purified DNA was then used as a template for DNA cycle sequencing using a Sequitherm (Epicentre Madison, WI) kit. The primer used was MuR (5′-GAAACGCTTTCGCGTTTTTCGTGC-3′) which hybridizes to the right end of the MudQ insertion. The location of four insertions in the thiP operon were determined via a PCR-based protocol (24Chen P. Ailion M. Weyland N. Roth J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1461-1469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amplification between the insertions was done using Vent (exo−) polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) in a Thermolyne Temp-Tronic Thermocycler (Dubuque, IA). Reaction conditions were as follows: 95 °C denaturation for 1 min, 55 °C annealing for 1 min, and 72 °C extension for 2 min. Primers used were: Tn10-I (5′-GACAAGATGTGTATCCACCTTAAC-3′), which hybridizes to the 66-base pair inverted repeat Tn10 sequence; MuL (5′-ATCCCGAATAATCCAATGTCC-3′), which hybridizes to the left end of the MudJ insertion; and MuR (defined above). Additional MgSO4was added to all reaction mixes to a final concentration of 1 mm. Amplified products were visualized via agarose gel electrophoresis, purified using Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Chatworth, CA), and sequenced at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center-Nucleic Acid and Protein Facility. Assays were performed using the Miller method (25Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 47-49Google Scholar) as described previously (26Escalante-Semerena J.C. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2251-2258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Curves were done aerobically as described (16Downs D.M. Petersen L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4858-4864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Final concentrations of THZ, thiamine, TMP, and TPP were as indicated. [32P]TPP was generated using cell-free extracts of a strain overproducing ThiL as described (1Webb E. Downs D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15702-15707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with the following exceptions. The ThiL reaction was initiated with the addition of 15 μl of ATP (10 μl of 100 mm ATP + MgCl2 and 5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 6000 Ci/mmol)). Radiolabeled [β-32P]TPP was purified from the ThiL reaction mix via column chromatography as described by Matsuda and Cooper (27Matsuda T. Cooper J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with the following exceptions. Twenty fractions (3 ml each) from the 60 ml of 0.1 m citrate buffer (pH 3.5) were collected. The TPP elution profile was tested by bioautography with strain DM1683 (thiL933::Tn10d(Tc)), which qualitatively determined the fractions containing significant TPP. To determine the radiochemical purity and concentration of the TPP, high pressure liquid chromatography analysis was performed on an aliquot of this fraction, as described previously (1Webb E. Downs D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15702-15707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Kawasaki T. Chytil F. McCormick D.B. Vitamins and Coenzymes, Part G. 122. Academic Press, Inc., New York1986: 15-29Google Scholar). The high pressure liquid chromatography fraction containing the TPP peak was collected and scintillation counted for 1 min in a Packard Instruments Model 4530 Scintillation Counter (Downers Grove, IL), demonstrating that the TPP accounted for ∼80% of the label. The specific activity of the TPP was calculated to be 9400 μCi/mmol. The protocol for the uptake assay used for thiamine and TPP was a combination of previously described methods (7Kawasaki T. Esaki K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 142: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 29Bellion E. Lash T.D. McKellar R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 735: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and is summarized below. Overnight cultures grown in NB were pelleted and resuspended in an equal volume of 0.85 m NaCl. 0.5 ml of resuspended cells were inoculated into 10 ml of minimal medium and incubated with shaking at 37 °C until the optical density at 560 nm was ∼0.4. Cultures were then pelleted, resuspended in 2 ml of minimal medium, separated into 1-ml aliquots, and stored on ice until needed. The cultures were equilibrated at 37 °C for 10 min, and assays were initiated by the addition of radioactive substrate (final concentration of 230 nm for [32P]TPP or 460 nm14C-labeled thiamine) to 1 ml of cells. Fractions (0.2 ml) were removed at specified time points, rapidly filtered through HA-type Millipore 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters (Bedford, MA), and washed with 20 ml of NCE salts medium. Filters were dried under a 150 watt lamp, mixed with 5 ml of scintillation fluid, and counted (1 min for [32P]TPP and 2 min for 14C-thiamine) in a Packard Instruments Model 4530 Scintillation Counter. Forty-seven independently isolated mutations causing a similar thiphenotype were identified, including 2 point mutations, 5Tn10(d), and 40 MudJ insertions. Phage P22 co-transduction analysis genetically mapped all of the insertions to the same locus, designated thiP (>90% linked). Growth curve analysis, represented in Fig. 1, revealed two significant points. Double mutants defective in bothde novo synthesis (thiH) and the thiPlocus required 1000-fold more TPP (100 nm versus100 μm) for maximal growth than the singlethiH mutant (Fig. 1, B and D), and yet these strains could reach optimal growth rates when supplied with >1 μm exogenous thiamine (Fig. 1, A and C). Additionally, thiP mutations in a wild-type background had no observable growth defects in minimal medium. The location of thethiP locus on the S. typhimurium chromosome was determined by sequencing the flanking DNA of a MudQ insertion (zac-8602::MudQ) known to be linked to thiP. BLAST (21Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69694) Google Scholar) computer data base analysis determined that the insertion was 3′ to the end of araC at Cs 1.5 based on sequence similarity to the E. coli genome sequence. Co-transductional analysis with P22 determined that thiP was >95% linked to the leucine biosynthetic operon, confirming thatthiP resided at Cs 1.5 in S. typhimurium and that the gene order was consistent with the predicted order from theE. coli chromosome. Four insertions in the thiP locus were physically mapped with a PCR-based protocol. Primers designed to the ends of the insertions were used to amplify DNA in strains containing both a MudJ and Tn10(d) insertion in the thiPlocus. Amplified products (∼400 base pairs) from strains DM3925 and DM3931 were purified and sequenced. Comparison with the E. coli data base using BLASTN determined that the two insertions in strains DM3925 were in the sfuA homologue (Tn10(d) at predicted amino acid residue 171 and MudJ at residue 262), while the insertions in strain DM3931 were in thesfuC homologue (MudJ at predicted amino acid residue 36 and Tn10(d) at residue 192). The sfuABC genes had been identified by the E. coli genome sequencing project between the leucine biosynthetic genes and arabinose utilization genes. This cluster was designatedsfu after S erratia ferric uptake, to reflect the significant sequence similarity to the Serratia marcescensferric uptake operon (an ABC transporter) and other ABC transporters. Here we designate the S. typhimurium genes thiBPQto more clearly reflect the involvement of this gene cluster in thiamine transport (Fig. 2). Comparison to known ABC-transporters suggested that thiBPQencoded a thiamine binding protein, an inner membrane channel, and an energy-transducing ATPase, respectively. Data base searches were performed to determine how widespread the ThiBPQ transport complex was in biology. Since ThiP and ThiQ, the channel and ATPase, respectively, shared significant homology with all ABC transporters, ThiB was used as a marker. BLASTP (21Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69694) Google Scholar) analysis with the E. coli proteins determined that all three components of the transport complex were only present in Hemophilus influenza. No other significant homologs for ThiB were found in any other organism listed in GenBankTM. Motif searches were also performed on the complex components using the PROSITE data base (30Bairoch A. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). These analyses determined that ThiB and ThiQ contained a bacterial binding protein motif and one nucleotide binding site, respectively. To test whether the thiBPQ operon encoded the predicted transporter, mutants defective in the operon were tested for their ability to transport radiolabeled thiamine and TPP (Fig. 3). These data clearly showed that the insertions in thiBPQ caused a defect in the transport of both thiamine and TPP. LT2 yielded rates of uptake of 2.9 ± 0.07 pmol of TPP/min/A560 nm and 6.3 ± 0.34 pmol of thiamine/min/A560 nm, whereas insertions in thiB or thiQ had rates that were ≤ 0. As stated earlier, mutants blocked in both de novo synthesis and thiBPQ were able to grow in the presence of 1 μm thiamine but not TPP. This result suggested there was an additional mechanism for transport of thiamine that was independent of ThiBPQ. To confirm that thiamine accumulated in a thiBmutant under these conditions, uptake assays were performed with 460 nm, 4.6 μm, and 23 μm thiamine (data not shown). Slight rate increases in accumulation of thiamine could be seen (no transport at 460 nm to 2.03 ± 0.32 pmol of thiamine/min/A560 nm at 23 μm). Although an operon structure was expected based on the E. coli sequence, a strain containing a MudJ transcriptional fusion in thiQwas used to confirm this assumption. Strains DM3926 (thiQ1054::MudJ) and DM3931 (thiQ1054::MudJthiB1012::Tn10d(Tc)) produced ∼30 and ∼4 units of β-galactosidase activity, respectively, when grown in minimal medium, consistent with an operon structure for thethiBPQ gene cluster. Data presented in Table II demonstrate that thiBPQ belonged to the growing number of TPP transcriptionally regulated genes in S. typhimurium (4Petersen L.A. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4894-4900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Webb E. Febres F. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2533-2538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This experiment was complicated by the fact that the transcriptional fusions in the genes of interest were defective for the transport of thiamine and TPP. We were able to circumvent this problem since we had determined that thiamine could accumulate in a thiB mutant when provided at concentrations >1 μm. As shown in TableII, β-galactosidase activities varying from 70 to 20 units were obtained in minimal medium using different insertions in the operon; however, in the presence of exogenous thiamine (1 mm), expression was reduced 3–4-fold (Strains DM3781 and DM3782). To address whether this response was to thiamine or TPP, the previously characterized thiL927 point mutation was utilized (1Webb E. Downs D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15702-15707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Strains containing this point mutation and a thi reporter are completely repressed by TPP, but not thiamine due to altered thiamine monophosphate kinase, ThiL (EC 2.7.4.16), activity. Two insertions thiB1062::MudJ and thiQ1054::MudJ were transduced into athiL927 point mutation background, generating strains DM3671 and 3670, respectively. As shown in Table II, strains containing thethiL927 point mutation were not repressed completely in response to thiamine, while the isogenic strain exhibited normal repression. These data are consistent with repression of thethiBPQ operon occurring in response to TPP, as are other previously described thiamine biosynthetic operons.Table IITranscriptional regulation of thiBPQStrainGenotypeβ-Galactosidase activityMinimalMinimal 1 mm thiamineDM3670thiQ1054::MudJzaj-8048::Tn10d(Tc) thiL92731.9 ± 5.119.3 ± 4.0DM3781thiQ1054::MudJzaj-8048::Tn10d(Tc)20.6 ± 0.65.9 ± 1.1DM3671thiB1062::MudJzaj-8048::Tn10d(Tc)thiL92780.0 ± 7.255.5 ± 4.1DM3782thiB1062::MudJzaj-8048::Tn10d(Tc)70.0 ± 7.425.6 ± 3.2 Open table in a new tab Work presented here identifies a new ABC transporter (thiBPQ) in S. typhimurium.

This agrees with previous work in E. coliwhich demonstrated that the thiamine transport was energy-dependent, independent of de novobiosynthesis, and repressed by thiamine (possibly TPP) (8Kawasaki T.

Bacteriol. 1972; 112: 1118-1126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown in E. coli that the ThiB protein has high affinity for the binding of thiamine, TMP, and TPP, 2A. Hollenbach (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN), personal communication. suggesting thatthiBPQ is also responsible for TMP transport. This three-gene operon is present in E. coli at the same chromosome location; therefore, we propose that the gene designations be changed from sfuABC to thiBPQ to more clearly define the role of this operon in thiamine metabolism. A recent publication (33Singleton C.K. Gene. 1997; 199: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) has identified the thiamine transport gene inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Unlike the transport system for thiamine and TPP in E. coli and S. typhimurium(ABC tranporter), this gene is a member of the majorfacilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters (34Saier M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 71-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MFS class of transporters differs from ABC-type transporters in two significant ways: the translocation complex is encoded by a single gene, and the energy for translocation does not come from ATP hydrolysis but is carrier mediated. S. cerevisiae is unable to transport TPP (35Nosaka K. Kaneko Y. Nishimura H. Iwashima A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17440-17447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting that a different mechanism for thiamine transport has evolved and that these two systems differ not only in structure but in substrate recognition. The fact that strains containing mutations in thiBPQ and ade novo block in thiamine biosynthesis were corrected with 100-fold less thiamine (1 μm) than TPP (100 μm) suggested that there was another mechanism for thiamine uptake in S. typhimurium. In fact we could show that, at concentrations >4.6 μm, thiamine did accumulate in a thiB mutant. We propose that this accumulation was due to a low affinity thiamine transport system or nonspecific transport by another translocation complex. The transcriptional regulation of this operon was addressed using MudJ insertions in thiB and thiQ. These analyses determined that this operon was repressed in response to excess, exogenously supplied thiamine (>1 mm). Additional experiments showed that TPP was the likely effector, as has been shown for other transcriptionally regulated thi genes in S. typhimurium. thiBPQ represents the third operon shown to be regulated in response to TPP in S. typhimurium. These genes map throughout the S. typhimurium chromosome: thiBPQ, thiMD, and thiCEFSGH at Cs 1.5, 46, and 90, respectively, and represent genes involved in salvage, biosynthesis, and transport. Recently it has been shown that many genes involved in thiamine metabolism in bacteria have a highly conserved 39 base pair region called the thi-box 5′ to the start of translation (36Miranda-Rios J. Morera C. Taboada H. Davalos A. Encarnacion S. Mora J. Soberon M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6887-6893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the thiBPQ sequence from E. colidetermined that this operon also contained this element. The presence of the thi box in 5′ to translation in all genes found to be regulated by TPP predicts the existence of a TPP-responsive regulatory protein."

Protein interaction studies were pursued to gain insight into the functions of the putative nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), atypical glycoprotein (gp18), and X protein (X) of BDV. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that N and P, and P and X, form complexes in infected cells. Two-hybrid analyses confirmed interactions between P and P, P and X, and P and N, but not between P and gp18, N and gp18, X and gp18, or X and N. Analysis of P truncation mutants identified three nonoverlapping regions important for oligomerization (amino acids (aa) 135–172), and binding to X (aa 33–115) or N (aa 197–201). Coexpression of X stimulated oligomerization of P but decreased N-P complex formation. Immunocytochemistry of transfected noninfected CHO cells demonstrated that the distribution of X is dependent upon the presence of P-X expressed alone was found predominantly in the cytoplasm whereas coexpression of X and P resulted in nuclear localization. Immunocytochemistry of infected cells revealed nuclear colocalization of P and X. Interactions of P, N, and X may have implications for regulation of BDV transcription/replication and ribonucleoprotein assembly."

The proton-translocating ATP synthases couple the generation of ATP to the protonmotive force present across membranes involved in energy transduction (for reviews, see Refs. 1Fillingame R.H. J. Exp.

These complex enzymes consist of a peripheral F1 sector, which catalyzes ATP synthesis and hydrolysis, and an integral F0 sector, which catalyzes movements of protons across the membrane. In the relatively simple ATP synthase of Escherichia coli, F1 contains five types of subunits in a stoichiometry of α3β3γδε, while F0contains three types of subunits in a stoichiometry ofab2 c9–12. Subunit interactions at the interface of the two sectors are responsible for coupling their catalytic activities. Recent work has strongly indicated that hydrolysis of ATP by F1 is accompanied by rotation of the γ and ε subunits relative to the α3β3 hexameric ring (5Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L.

Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar) reveals that the N and C termini of γ form an antiparallel coiled-coil running up the center of the α3β3 ring; this structure appears to function as an asymmetric spindle, which, by rotating, plays the major role in directing conformational changes at the catalytic sites. In the intact ATP synthase, the rotation of γ and ε should be coupled to proton conduction through F0. The a and c subunits provide those residues that are essential for proton conduction. In all systems, δ or the analogous mitochondrial protein called oligomycin sensitivity conferral protein (OSCP), 1The abbreviations used are: OSCP, oligomycin sensitivity conferral proteins; bsol and bsyn, forms of the cytoplasmic domain of theb subunit containing residues Val25–Leu156 and Tyr24–Leu156, respectively;b34–156 and b53–156, forms of the cytoplasmic domain of the b subunit containing residues Glu34–Leu156 and Asp53–Leu156, respectively, preceded by the leader sequence Ser-Tyr-Trp, assuming removal of the initiating methionine; bST34–156, a form of the cytoplasmic domain of the b subunit containing residues Glu34–Leu156 preceded by a leader sequence of Ser-Thr, assuming removal of the initiating methionine;sobs, the sedimentation coefficient observed under the experimental conditions. is essential for the coupling of the catalytic activities of the two sectors. The δ subunit (reviewed in Ref. 14Engelbrecht S. Junge W. Biochim. Biophys.

This effect is not seen inE. coli, but here δ is essential for the interaction of F1 and F0, implying a link between δ and F0 (22Futai M. Sternweis P.C. Heppel L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

E. coli δ purified following pyridine treatment of F1-ATPase was shown to be an elongated monomer (33Sternweis P.C. Smith J.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4020-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but the low yield of the preparation limited the scope of work that could be carried out. The current studies were undertaken to produce recombinant δ in quantities appropriate for high resolution structural analysis and to permit the characterization of interactions of δ with other subunits in ATP synthase. Here we describe the preparation of recombinant δ and a proteolytic fragment called δ′ as well as the hydrodynamic analysis of a complex of δ with the cytoplasmic domain of the b subunit of F0. The solution structure of δ′ has been previously reported (34Wilkens S. Dunn S.D. Chandler J. Dahlquist F.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Recombinant DNA procedures were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) usingE. coli strain MM294 (36Meselson M. Yuan R.

Bacteriol. 1995; 77: 3917-3922Crossref Google Scholar), which carries the tac promoter,lacIq, and the unc transcription terminator, was used as the vector. The E. coli uncH DNA sequence encoding the δ subunit was amplified, and the translation initiation region was altered using the expression cassette polymerase chain reaction procedure of MacFerrin et al. (38MacFerrin K.D. Terranova M.P. Schreiber S.L. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1937-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The upstream primer, CGCGGAATTCTGGAGGATTTTAAAATGTCTGAATTTATTACGG, contained an EcoRI cloning site, a Shine-Dalgarno sequence, an A/T-rich spacer region, and the first 19 bases of theuncH coding sequence. The downstream primer, GCATCCCGGGTTAAGACTGCAAGACGTCTG, contained a SmaI cloning site and the last 20 bases of the uncH coding sequence. The PCR product was cut with EcoRI and SmaI and then ligated into pHN2 that had been digested with the same enzymes, to produce plasmid pJC1. The uncH gene in pJC1 was sequenced and compared with the published sequence (39Walker J.E. Saraste M. Gay N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 164-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) to confirm that no mutations had been introduced within the coding region. A form of the b subunit lacking aromatic residues,bST34–156, was expressed from plasmid pJB3. This plasmid was constructed using polymerase chain reaction to mutate the N-terminal sequence of bsyn, encoded by plasmid pDM3 (40McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The mutagenic primer, CGCGCATATGAGTACTGAAAAGCGCCAAAAAG, included successive NdeI and ScaI sites, which encoded a Met-Ser-Thr leader followed by 16 bases encoding the b sequence beginning with residue Glu34; the M13 universal primer was used as the downstream primer. The product was cut with NdeI and BglII and inserted into pJB2, a derivative of pSD80 (41Smith S.P. Barber K.R. Dunn S.D. Shaw G.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8805-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) containing a modified bsyn coding sequence (40McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), in which anNdeI site had been placed at the start codon. The insert was sequenced to ensure that no undesired mutations had been introduced. Strain MM294/pJC1 was grown at 30 °C in LB broth with vigorous shaking. When the cells reached a density that gave an A600 of 0.8, isopropylthiogalactoside was added to a concentration of 1 mm, and growth was continued for 3–4 h. After harvesting and washing, the cell pellet was suspended in 10 volumes of cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to a concentration of 1 mm, and the cells were broken by one passage through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. Cell debris, ribosomes, and membranes were removed by centrifugation for 1.5 h at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti-60 rotor. Soluble proteins were fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and column chromatography. Material precipitating between 20 and 32% of saturation was collected, redissolved in one-half the original volume, and again brought to 32% saturation with ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was collected, redissolved in 5 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (TED buffer), and dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of the same buffer. The sample was applied to a column of DEAE-Sepharose (1.5 × 30 cm) equilibrated with TED buffer, and the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–400 mm NaCl in TED buffer. The δ subunit eluted as the major peak midway through the gradient. The protein was precipitated by the addition of ammonium sulfate to 40% of saturation, redissolved in a small volume of TED buffer, and applied to a column (1.5 × 90 cm) of Sephadex G-75 Superfine. The column was developed at a flow rate of 3 ml/h. Pure δ eluted as the major peak. The yield was between 10 and 20 mg/liter of LB culture. Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed at 20 °C using a Beckman model XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. The buffer contained 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. In sedimentation velocity experiments, the rotor speed was 60,000 rpm, and scans were taken at 10-min intervals. Data were analyzed using the software provided by Beckman. Observed sedimentation coefficients were calculated using the time derivative (dc/dt) analysis of Stafford (42Stafford W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 161: 70-79Google Scholar), fitting the peak of the g(s*) versus s* plot to a Gaussian distribution. Molecular weight determinations using sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out using six-sector cells at various rotor speeds. Data sets were individually fitted to determine molecular weights. Partial specific volumes were calculated by standard methods (43Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids, and Peptides. Reinhold, New York1943: 157-161Google Scholar). bST34–156 was purified using techniques similar to those employed for other forms of theb cytoplasmic domain (32Dunn S.D. J. Biol.

Fractions used in analytical ultracentrifugation experiments had absorbance at 280 nm of less than 0.005/mg/ml. The expression and purification of two other forms of the b cytoplasmic domain,b34–156 or b53–156, have been described previously (40McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). δ-Depleted F1-ATPase was the generous gift of Drs. S. Wilkens and R. Capaldi of the University of Oregon (Eugene, OR). Protein was determined using the method of Bradford (44Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216178) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out on 15% polyacrylamide gels using the buffer system of Laemmli (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of energy-dependent quenching of quinacrine fluorescence was measured as described previously (32Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Fraga D. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6797-6803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using F1-ATPase-depleted membranes (0.9 mg of protein) in a volume of 2.7 ml. In one set of experiments, various amounts of δ were mixed with 44 pmol of δ-depleted F1-ATPase and 20 pmol of ε and then reconstituted with the depleted membrane vesicles. In a second set of experiments, various amounts of δ-depleted F1-ATPase were mixed with 200 pmol of δ and 20 pmol of ε and then reconstituted and assayed as above. After dilution to 2.7 ml, the quenching of quinacrine fluorescence by 1 mm ATP was determined. Previous plasmids carrying uncH, which encodes δ, and its natural translation initiation region gave poor expression of δ, even when transcription was from a high level promoter. 2S. D. Dunn, unpublished observations. Two factors that may have contributed to this low expression were corrected in the construction of pJC1. First, evidence that an mRNA secondary structure encompassing the region of uncH from the Shine-Dalgarno to residue 36 of the coding sequence strongly reduces expression has been presented by Pati and co-workers (47Pati S. DiSilvestre D. Brusilow W.S.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3559-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the construction of plasmid pJC1, the expression cassette polymerase chain reaction strategy of MacFerrin et al. (38MacFerrin K.D. Terranova M.P. Schreiber S.L. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1937-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was used to replace C and G residues in the spacer region between the Shine-Dalgarno and the initiation codon with A or T to weaken this secondary structure, making the translation initiation region more accessible to ribosomes. Second, in pJC1 the unctranscriptional terminator was placed downstream of the uncHsequence. We have previously shown that the terminator placed immediately after a coding sequence can increase expression by stabilizing the transcript against exonucleolytic attack (48Patel A.M. Dallmann H.G. Skakoon E.N. Kapala T.D. Dunn S.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Induction of pJC1 with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C led to the synthesis of large amounts of δ, but essentially all of the expressed subunit was in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies (data not shown). Growth and induction of cells at 30 °C led to the expression of good levels of soluble δ (see Fig. 1 A), although if the induction period was extended beyond 3 h, some of the subunit was insoluble. The soluble portion of δ was purified to homogeneity using the standard procedures of ammonium sulfate precipitation and using ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples of the preparation at various stages were examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 A). The δ subunit was unstable in the crude extract. Coincident with the loss of δ was the appearance of a new 14-kDa polypeptide, designated δ′ because it could be identified immunochemically as a fragment of δ (data not shown). For the purification of intact δ, proteolysis was minimized by designing the ammonium sulfate fractionation to provide higher purification in exchange for a lower yield. Nevertheless, a portion of δ was cleaved during the subsequent dialysis in preparation for DEAE-Sepharose chromatography, and δ′ eluted from this column just after δ with some overlap, as can be seen in the samples of sequential column fractions in Fig. 1 B (also note the material at position of thearrow in the DEAE pool of Fig. 1 A). The residual δ′ and the higher molecular weight impurities were removed from δ by size exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-75. The δ′ fragment has also been purified using Sephadex G-75. 3S. Wilkens and R. A. Capaldi, personal communication. The recombinant δ was capable of fulfilling the role of the subunit in energy transduction. In the experiment shown in Fig. 2, the indicated amounts of either δ or δ-depleted F1-ATPase were mixed with an excess of the complementary component and then reconstituted with membrane vesicles depleted of their endogenous F1, and ATP-dependent quinacrine quenching was measured. Essentially the same molar amounts of δ or δ-depleted F1-ATPase were required to restore maximal quenching, indicating that the recombinant δ is folded properly and fully functional. Preliminary experiments conducted by techniques such as size exclusion chromatography indicated that any interaction between δ and bsol (32Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the cytoplasmic domain of b, would be relatively weak.2 To see such an interaction, we carried out sedimentation velocity experiments in the analytical ultracentrifuge. This technique has the advantages that relatively high concentrations may be analyzed, the sample is not significantly diluted during the experiment, and information about the size and shape of the complex can be obtained. Isolated recombinant δ sedimented at 20 °C withsobs = 1.67 S (TableI), a value similar to that of the expressed cytoplasmic domain of b, which forms dimers (32Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,40McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These proteins sediment slowly considering their molecular weights, indicating that both, especially b, are extended. A complex of the two proteins should sediment more rapidly because of its greater molecular weight, and the extent of the increase will depend on the overall shape of the complex. Experiments summarized in Table Ishow that mixtures of the soluble b domainsb34–156 or b53–156 with δ sedimented slightly more rapidly than either component alone, indicating complex formation to some extent. The complex did not sediment rapidly enough to form a boundary that could be resolved from that of the excess b domains that were present in these experiments, so the observed sedimentation coefficients reflect contributions from both complexed and unassociated species. Accordingly, it was difficult to ascertain whether the observeds values reflected substantial formation of a complex that sedimented only marginally faster than either individual component or weaker formation of a complex that would sediment substantially faster.Table ISedimentation velocity of δ with soluble domains of bPolypeptidesSobsδb34–156b53–156mg/mls0.51.671.51.750.51.52.010.250.751.811.21.610.51.21.88 Open table in a new tab To eliminate the contribution of the excess free b subunit to the observed svalue, we produced a form of b lacking aromatic residues (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The only tryptophan and tyrosine residues present in b34–156 and b53–156 were added at their N termini during plasmid construction to make them detectable at 280 nm, so removing them would not be expected to affect the interaction with δ. In the new polypeptide, a leader sequence Met-Ser-Thr was fused to residues Glu34 to Leu156 of b; since the N-terminal methionine is ordinarily removed, this polypeptide was called bST34–156, to indicate the Ser-Thr leader and to distinguish it from the polypeptide previously denotedb34–156. Lacking aromatic residues,bST34–156 is transparent at 280 nm but can still be observed at wavelengths below 250 nm due to absorbance by the peptide bond and certain side chains. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments showed bST34–156 to be essentially dimeric (see observed and inferred molecular weights in TableII) but with a slight tendency to become monomeric at low protein concentrations. In sedimentation velocity analysis, a low concentration of bST34–156 (0.5 mg/ml) sedimented at 1.47 S, and the sedimentation coefficient increased to 1.71 at higher concentrations (Fig. 3, ▴). Again, this pattern suggests some degree of dissociation into monomers at low protein concentration, so the value observed at the higher concentrations is more likely an accurate reflection of the sedimentation coefficient of the dimer.Table IIMolecular weight determinations by sedimentation equilibrium analysisComponent, inferred molecular weightRotor speedConcentration; wavelengthAnalysis method,2-2001The partial specific volumes ofbST34–156 and δ were calculated to be 0.740 and 0.742 cm3 per g, respectively. molecular weight ± S.D.; number of determinationsrpm(bST34–156)2, 27,50430,0000.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/ml; 240 nmOne component, 28,500 ± 1,400; 8δ,2-bMore details of this experiment can be found in the legend to Fig. 4. 19,20415,0001 mg/ml; 280 nmOne component, 22,500 ± 400; 3(bST34–156)2δ,2-bMore details of this experiment can be found in the legend to Fig. 4.46,70815,0001 mg of δ/ml, 4 mg ofbST34–156/ml; 280 nmOne component,2-2003The same data were fitted for either one or two components.

For the two-component fit, the first component was taken to be free δ, and the best fit for the molecular weight of a second, noninteracting component was determined. Open table in a new tab A set of sedimentation velocity experiments was conducted in which δ at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml was sedimented in the presence of various concentrations of bST34–156 (Fig. 3, •) Three or four determinations were made at each concentration, with the S.D. indicated by the error bars. The addition of thebST34–156 caused the observed svalue of δ to rise rapidly from 1.67 to 2.08 S and then to rise more slowly with further increases in b concentration. Calculation of s20,w by correction of the data for solvent density provides a value of 2.07–2.16, depending on whether one uses the sobs value obtained at 4 mg/ml bST34–156 or extrapolates to zerob concentration as shown in Fig. 3. Regardless of the choice, these results demonstrate that the complex sediments only moderately faster than either component alone. Sedimentation coefficients were also measured for (bST34–156)2-δ mixtures in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+, since this ion is particularly effective in maintaining the F1-F0interaction. At low concentrations of the b domain, Mg2+ caused a slight reduction in the rate of sedimentation, but there was little effect atbST34–156 concentrations of 3 or 4 mg/ml (data not shown). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out to confirm the subunit stoichiometry of the complex as (bST34–156)2δ. In this experiment, the starting concentrations of δ and bST34–156 were 1 and 4 mg/ml, respectively; this represents a 2.8-fold molar excess ofbST34–156 dimer over δ. With these high concentrations and the low rotor speeds used (12,000–18,000 rpm), substantial concentrations of all species were maintained even near the meniscus so that complex formation would be favored. As in the sedimentation velocity analyses, the distribution of δ and complexes containing δ could be determined at 280 nm without any direct contribution from bST34–156; representative data are shown in Fig. 4. The apparent concentration gradient of δ in the presence of the bdomain (▴) was significantly steeper than when the subunit was present alone (•), indicative of formation of a complex with higher molecular weight.

The seven WD repeats in Gβ, the only WD repeat protein whose crystal structure is known, form seven antiparallel β sheets making up the blades of a toroidal propeller structure (Wall, M.

(1996) Nature 379, 369–374). It is likely that all proteins with WD repeats form a propeller structure. Alignment of the sequence of 918 unique WD repeats reveals that 85% of the repeats have an aspartic acid (D) residue (not the D of WD) in the turn connecting β strands b and c of each putative propeller blade. We mutated each of these conserved Asp residues to Gly individually and in pairs in Gβ and in Sec13, a yeast WD repeat protein involved in vesicular traffic, and then analyzed the ability of the mutant proteins to fold in vitro and in COS-7 cells. In vitro, most single mutant Gβ subunits fold into Gβγ dimers more slowly than wild type to a degree that varies with the blade. In contrast, all single mutants form normal amounts of Gβγ in COS-7 cells, although some dimers show subtle local distortions of structure. Most double mutants assemble poorly in both systems. We conclude that the conserved Asp residues are not equivalent and not all are essential for the folding of the propeller structure. Some may affect the folding pathway or the affinity for chaperonins. Mutations of the conserved Asp in Sec13 affect folding equally in vitro and in COS-7 cells. The repeats that most affected folding were not at the same position in Sec13 and Gβ. Our finding, both in Gβ and in Sec13, that no mutation of the conserved Asp entirely prevents folding suggests that there is no obligatory folding order for each repeat and that the folding order is probably not the same for different WD repeat proteins, or even necessarily constant for the same protein.

The β subunit of the heterotrimeric G proteins that transduce signals across the plasma membrane is made up of two distinct regions as follows: an amino-terminal α-helical segment, followed by 7 repeating units called WD repeats that occur in about 140 different proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar and 2Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Members of the family of WD repeat proteins do not have an immediately obvious common function but are involved in diverse cellular pathways such as signal transduction, pre-mRNA splicing, transcriptional regulation, cytoskeletal assembly, and vesicular traffic (2Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Each WD repeat consists of a conserved core of approximately 40 amino acids (typically bracketed by the dipeptides GH (glycine-histidine) and WD (tryptophan-aspartic acid)) and a variable region of 7–11 amino acids (2Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Gβ is the only WD repeat protein whose crystal structure is known (3Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 4Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 5Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). The seven WD repeats in Gβ are arranged in a ring to form a propeller structure with seven blades. Each blade of the propeller consists of a four-stranded antiparallel β sheet oriented so that the outer surfaces of the torus are composed of the sheet edges, whereas the turns protrude from the two flat surfaces (see Fig. 1). It is likely that all proteins with WD repeats form a propeller structure, although with varying numbers of blades corresponding to varying numbers of repeating units. WD repeats are not essential to form a propeller. Other families of proteins with no sequence similarity to WD repeat proteins form propellers whose blades are virtually identical to those in Gβ (reviewed in Ref. 6Neer E.J. Smith T.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 175-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, within the subset of propellers formed of WD repeats, it is reasonable to suppose that the most highly conserved residues play an important role either in the function or the structure. The WD repeats are not characterized by a rigidly conserved sequence but rather by their fit to a regular expression that allows limited variation at each position (2Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). However, alignment of the sequences of 918 unique WD repeats in our data set reveals that one residue is the most conserved; an aspartic acid residue (D, not the D in WD) located in the loop connecting β strands b and c of each propeller blade in Gβ (and presumably in all other WD repeat proteins) occurs in 85% of the repeats. In another 9%, the residue is Glu or Asn. This extraordinary conservation suggests that the Asp residue performs an important function that is shared by all WD repeats. Since the WD repeat proteins do not appear to bind to any common molecule, we tested the hypothesis that the conserved Asp plays a role in the folding of the propeller. The occurrence of a conserved residue at an equivalent position in each repeat allowed us to ask a number of questions. Are all the Asp residues equivalent within a protein? Are the consequences of mutating Asp to Gly the same in different proteins? It is not known whether the WD repeat or other propeller proteins fold by a single or multiple pathways. If there is a single pathway, we would expect that mutation of a critical Asp would have a large effect on folding kinetics, whereas if multiple pathways to the final structure exist, a single mutation might have little effect since it would be kinetically less important if an alternative pathway could be followed (7Harrison S.C. Durbin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4028-4030Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To analyze such questions, we mutated the conserved Asp to Gly in two WD repeat proteins, Gβ and Sec13, a yeast protein involved in vesicular traffic (8Pryer N.K. Salama N.R. Schekman R.W. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Mutations were inserted one at a time or two at a time. We mutated Asp to Gly because a Gly residue makes the polypeptide chain flexible and is compatible with formation of a turn. Futhermore, the side chain of Asp points into the structure of β and, in some cases, makes contact with other residues within the propeller blade (see “Discussion”). Therefore, we wanted an amino acid that had a small side chain not to confound interpretation by effects produced by the side chain of the amino acid substituted for the aspartic acid residue. Gβ was chosen because its crystal structure is known. Sec13 has 6 repeats and no amino- or carboxyl-terminal extension. We have made and tested a model of Sec13 based on the structure of Gβ (9Saxena K. Gaitatzes C. Walsh M.T. Eck M. Neer E.J. Smith T.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15215-15221Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The model predicts that the conserved Asp are in equivalent positions to Gβ. The Gβ and Sec13 differ in their requirements for folding. Gβ cannot fold completely without Gγ (10Schmidt C.J. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4538-4544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to which it is very tightly bound in the native structure. Furthermore, folding and/or assembly probably requires as yet undefined chaperones (11Mende U. Schmidt C.J. Yi F. Spring D.J. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15892-15898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast, Sec13 can fold into a globular, trypsin-resistant structure when synthesized in Escherichia coli, wheat germ, rabbit reticulocyte lysate in in vitro translation systems, or in mammalian cells (9Saxena K. Gaitatzes C. Walsh M.T. Eck M. Neer E.J. Smith T.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15215-15221Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12Garcia-Higuera I. Fenoglio J. Li Y. Lewis C. Panchenko M.P. Reiner O. Smith T.F. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13985-13994Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). If it requires chaperones at all, it can productively interact with several different ones. We have analyzed the ability of Gβ to fold and assemble with Gγ and of Sec13 to form a compact structure after synthesis in vitro and in COS-7 cells. This comparison allows us to discriminate between mutations that affect the end state and those that affect the rate of folding. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1The abbreviations used are: FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Hβ1, hexahistidine-tagged β1; HA, hemagglutinin; BMH, 1,6-bismaleimidohexane; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; wt, wild type. 2 mmglutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Transfections were done with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, cells on 6-well dishes were transfected with 2 μg of total DNA and 15 μg of LipofectAMINE in 1 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 5–6 h, after which 1 volume of Opti-MEM supplemented with 8% FBS was added to each well. 18–24 h after the start of transfection, this medium was replaced with complete culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% FBS), and cells were incubated at 37 °C overnight and then biosynthetically labeled. For labeling, cells were first starved in a methionine/cysteine-deficient RPMI medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 30–45 min and then labeled with 0.1 mCi of Express Protein Labeling Mix (NEN Life Science Products) per well (1 ml) in the presence of 10% dialyzed FBS. After 2.5–3 h at 37 °C, the medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested by trypsinization. Mutations in the β1 cDNA were generated using the Altered Sites in vitromutagenesis system (Promega). To construct a hexahistidine-tagged β1 (Hβ1) subunit, the initial methionine was mutated to glutamine, and at the same time, a HindIII and a PstI site were introduced. An annealed double-stranded DNA encoding the first methionine and six histidines was synthesized and ligated between the new HindIII site and theEcoRI site from the pAlter vector. The amino acid sequence of the amino-terminally tagged β1 is MSHHHHHHGSLLQ. In addition, to facilitate the transfer of the mutants to other vectors, a silent mutation corresponding to amino acids 144 and 145 was introduced into β1 to create a unique KpnI site. This construct (Hβ1 in pAlter) was used as a template for creating all mutants. The mutated residues were Asp-76 in repeat 1 (Hβ1[D1]), Asp-118 in repeat 2 [Hβ1[D2]), Asp-163 in repeat 3 (Hβ1[D3]), Asp-205 in repeat 4 (Hβ1[D4]), Asp-247 in repeat 5 (Hβ1[D5]), Asp-291 in repeat 6 (Hβ1[D6]), and Asp-333 in repeat 7 (Hβ1[D7]), and all were changed to glycine using the codon that allowed a single base substitution (GGT or GGC). All mutations were confirmed by double-stranded sequencing. For expression in COS-7 cells, the wild-type (wt) Hβ1 cDNA or the mutated forms were transferred to the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The single mutants Hβ1[D2] and Hβ1[D3] were obtained from the double mutant Hβ1[D2–3] by inserting a HindIII-KpnI fragment containing the [D2] mutation or a KpnI-BamHI fragment with the [D3] mutation into an Hβ1-pcDNA3 background. Likewise, the double mutants Hβ1[D1–7] and Hβ1[D2–7] were generated by inserting theHindIII-KpnI fragment from either Hβ1[D1] or Hβ1[D2] into Hβ1[D7] in pcDNA3. For Hβ1[D4–7], Hβ1[D4] in pcDNA3 was cut with NdeI and ligated into Hβ1[D7]. The HA-γ2 construct (γ2 tagged at the amino terminus with the hemagglutinin epitope) previously described (11Mende U. Schmidt C.J. Yi F. Spring D.J. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15892-15898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was also subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector. αi-2 cDNA was originally provided by Dr. R. R. Reed and was subsequently transferred to pcDNA3. γ3 (kindly provided by Dr. M. I. Simon, Caltech, Pasadena, CA) was amino-terminally tagged with the hemagglutinin epitope by cloning the coding sequence between the StuI and XbaI sites in the HA-tag pBS (R) vector (a hemagglutinin-tagged Bluescript vector provided by Dr. T. Kirchhausen, Harvard Medical School, Boston). The same sites had been previously introduced at the 5′ and 3′ ends of γ3 by polymerase chain reaction. The HA-γ3 sequence was then cloned in pcDNA3. Prior to mutagenesis of Sec13 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. C. Kaiser, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA), an HA epitope was fused to the amino terminus of the protein. For this purpose, a StuI site was introduced by polymerase chain reaction 3′ to the starting methionine, and aStuI-BglII fragment from the polymerase chain reaction product together with a BglII-SacI fragment from Sec13 in pBluescript (described in Ref. 12Garcia-Higuera I. Fenoglio J. Li Y. Lewis C. Panchenko M.P. Reiner O. Smith T.F. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13985-13994Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) were cloned between the StuI and SacI sites of the hemagglutinin-tagged Bluescript vector (HA-pBS). The coding sequence of HA-Sec13 was then transferred to the pAlterMax vector (Promega), and this construct was used as template to create mutations using the altered sites mammalian mutagenesis system. The mutated residues were Asp-30 (HA-Sec[D1]), Asp-76 (HA-Sec[D2]), Asp-122 (HA-Sec[D3]), Asp-179 (HA-Sec[D4]), Asp-228 (HA-Sec[D5]), and Asp-275 (HA-Sec[D6]). Each was changed to glycine. All proteins were transcribed and translated using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Typically, 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 20 μCi of [35S]methionine or [35S]cysteine were used in a 50-μl reaction. In all cases, transcription was directed by the T7 promoter either from pAlter or pcDNA3. To increase expression levels, all γ subunits were subcloned into the PAGA-1 vector (provided by Dr. O. Reiner) that contains a poly(A) sequence and the alfalfa mosaic virus leader sequence, which has been previously shown to improve translation efficiency (13Jobling S.A. Gehrke L. Nature. 1987; 325: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Synthesis of the desired product was routinely verified by running 2–5 μl of the translation mixture in a small 11 or 13% polyacrylamide gel (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar) followed by autoradiography with overnight exposure. Mixtures of independently translated β and γ were then made, such that γ was in excess and the subunits were incubated together at 37 °C for 90 min to dimerize. After dimerization, the samples were either subjected to immunoprecipitation or to trypsin digestion. For immunoprecipitation, 10–20 μl of the mixture was diluted in 500 μl of RIPA buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40), precleared with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose slurry (50% v/v in PBS) for 45 min at 4 °C, and incubated for 60–90 min with 2 μl of 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (Babco) directed against the HA epitope present in the Gγ subunit used. Protein A-Sepharose (50 μl) was then added, and the mixture was rocked for 45–60 min at 4 °C, washed three times in RIPA buffer, and once in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Immunobeads were then boiled in Laemmli sample buffer (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar) and the proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE on 11% polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. Trypsin digestion of in vitro translated proteins was performed as described previously (15Garcia-Higuera I. Thomas T.C. Yi F. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 528-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Seven μl of βγ mixture or Sec13 translation reaction were treated with 1 μl of 20 μml-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethylchloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Cooper Biomed) and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, after which 2 μl of 100 mm benzamidine were added to stop the reaction. The samples were then boiled for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed electrophoretically. Labeled cells were lysed in TNE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA) plus 1% Triton X-100 and 0.25% deoxycholic acid supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 mm benzamidine, and 1 μg/ml each of soy and lima bean trypsin inhibitor). After lysis, all further steps were performed at 4 °C. The lysates (1 ml/well transfected cells) were first precleared with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose slurry (50% v/v in PBS) for 45–60 min and then incubated for 2 h or overnight with 4 μl of 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (anti-HA epitope). At this point, each sample was usually split in 2 aliquots (500 μl each), and 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose slurry (1:1) was added to each one. After 45–60 min, samples were washed three or four times with the lysis buffer and once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA (ADP-ribosylation buffer). One aliquot of each sample was then boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, and the other aliquot was subjected to ADP-ribosylation with Bordetella pertussistoxin. The reaction was carried out in a 30-μl volume containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm thymidine, 10 μm NAD, 1 mmNADP, 100 μm GTP, 1 mm ATP, 0.5 μCi of [32P]NAD, and 10 μg/ml activated pertussis toxin. After 30–60 min at 37 °C, the samples were washed with 1 ml of ice-cold ADP-ribosylation buffer, boiled in Laemmli sample buffer (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar), and analyzed on 11% SDS-PAGE. For exposure of [32P] signal without contribution from [35S], a black film was placed between the gel and the film to be exposed. Lysis and immunoprecipitation were performed essentially as described above, except that deoxycholic acid was not included in the lysis buffer. Washes in the lysis buffer were followed by two additional washes in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the final pellet of protein A-Sepharose beads was resuspended in 30 μl of this same buffer. For trypsin digestion, 1 μl of 20 μml-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethylchloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Cooper Biomed) was then added to one of the aliquots of each sample (see above), and all samples were incubated at 30 °C for 10–15 min. The reaction was stopped with 2 μl of 100 mmbenzamidine. For cross-linking, 1 aliquot of each sample was treated with 1.6 μl of freshly prepared 50 mm BMH (1,6-bismaleimidohexane, Pierce) in Me2SO, and the other aliquot received only Me2SO. After 20 min on ice, Laemmli sample buffer containing 15% β-mercaptoethanol was added, and the samples were boiled for 5 min. The final products of both reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 11% polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. After labeling, transfected cells were lysed in buffer A (6 mguanidinium HCl, 0.1 mNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 8, 10 mm imidazole), and the lysate was then mixed with 50 μl of nickel nitriloacetic acid-agarose slurry (50% v/v in buffer A) (Qiagen) on a nutator for 3–5 h at room temperature. The beads were washed 5 times with buffer A and twice with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20 mm imidazole. Purified proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 200 mm imidazole and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Our goal was to determine if the most conserved residue in the WD repeat family of proteins (the Asp in the turn between β strands b and c of each blade structure, see Fig. 1) is essential for a WD repeat protein to fold into a β-propeller. Mutations of aspartic acid to glycine (Gly) were introduced in individual repeats of the β1subunit, as well as in adjacent repeats (2, 3; 4, 5; 6, 7), or pairwise in separate repeats (1, 7; 2, 7; 4, 7). All mutants were made in β1 tagged at the amino terminus with six histidine residues (Hβ1), which was useful because it allowed us to distinguish mutated from wild-type β in the transfection experiments to be described below. There was no difference between Hβ1 and the wild-type β1 in any of the assays used in this study (data not shown). The mutants are designated by the number of the repeat in which the mutation is placed,e.g. Hβ1 [D1], Hβ1 [D2], etc. The β subunit does not fold into a compact structure without Gγ but, instead, aggregates with itself and/or other proteins (10Schmidt C.J. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4538-4544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Garcia-Higuera I. Fenoglio J. Li Y. Lewis C. Panchenko M.P. Reiner O. Smith T.F. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13985-13994Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). βγ dimers can be synthesized and assembled in vitro using β and γ subunits synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Such dimers are indistinguishable in their physical properties from βγ dimers purified from bovine brain (10Schmidt C.J. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4538-4544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, we were able to estimate the distance between the cysteine residues at the interface between β and α by chemical cross-linking of in vitrosynthesized βγ to purified α. Our estimate was within 2 Å of that subsequently found in the crystal structure (3Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

Mutant β1 subunits were synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate and incubated with independently synthesized γ2 subunits tagged at the amino terminus with a hemagglutinin epitope (HA-γ2). The formation of dimers was assessed by immunoprecipitation of the β1 subunit through the HA epitope in γ2. Mutation of Asp to Gly in all repeats, except repeat 2 (Hβ1[D2]), diminishes the amount of βγ subunit immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2and Table I). Mutations in repeats 6 and 7 (Hβ1[D6] and Hβ1[D7]) produce the most severe phenotypes. None of the β1 subunits with two mutated Asp (either in adjacent repeats or in separate repeats) were able to form significant levels of dimers in vitro. All β1 subunits were translated with the same efficiency, so that the starting amount of β and γ was equal in all samples (data not shown). Therefore, the quantitative differences in the co-immunoprecipitation of Hβ1 reflect the relative ability of each mutant to fold into a βγ dimer.Table ISummary of properties of the D to G mutants in vitro and in cellsMutantHβ1Sec 13In vitroIn cellsIn vitroIn cellsDimer formationDimer formationTrypsin resistanceCross-link to γ3Interaction with αCorrect Stokes radiusTrypsin resistanceTrypsin resistance% wt% wt% wt% wt[D1]30 ± 885 ± 691 ± 4+99 ± 1+++[D2]87 ± 691 ± 392 ± 8+63 ± 8+−−[D3]32 ± 170 ± 95 ± 1+60 ± 10+−−[D4]48 ± 283 ± 691 ± 9+78 ± 8+−−[D5]52 ± 377 ± 667 ± 20+76 ± 12+−−[D6]9 ± 266 ± 993 ± 7+99 ± 1+++[D7]2 ± 176 ± 545 ± 5+99 ± 1[D2–3]17 ± 473 ± 61-2001Tryptic cleavage of Hβ1[D2–3] and Hβ1[D2–7] gave little or no stable carboxyl-terminal tryptic product.24 ± 3[D4–5]8 ± 526 ± 3[D6–7]2 ± 116 ± 3[D1–7]2 ± 117 ± 2[D2–7]1 ± 160 ± 101-2001Tryptic cleavage of Hβ1[D2–3] and Hβ1[D2–7] gave little or no stable carboxyl-terminal tryptic product.63 ± 3[D4–7]2 ± 137 ± 9[D1–6]++1-2001 Tryptic cleavage of Hβ1[D2–3] and Hβ1[D2–7] gave little or no stable carboxyl-terminal tryptic product. Open table in a new tab To determine whether the dimers that did form from some of the single mutants were properly folded, we used a well established tryptic cleavage assay. When Gβ is associated with Gγ, only one of its 32 potential tryptic cleavage sites is accessible to trypsin. Trypsin generates two fragments, an amino-terminal 14-kDa fragment, which is sometimes unstable and difficult to detect on SDS-PAGE, and a stable carboxyl-terminal 24-kDa fragment. The latter is a sensitive indicator of the formation of a properly folded βγ dimer (for example, see Ref. 15Garcia-Higuera I. Thomas T.C. Yi F. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 528-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Except for Hβ1[D3], the amount of protected carboxyl-terminal fragment (see Fig. 3), produced from each mutant, correlates well with the ability of that β1 mutant to be co-immunoprecipitated through the γ subunit. For this assay, dimerized Gβ is not separated from undimerized aggregated Gβ. The stable tryptic fragment can, therefore, only arise from the approximately 20% of total Gβ that dimerizes, so the yield appears low. The additional bands in the uncleaved lanes are internal starts or premature terminations of Gβ. This experiment suggests that even though most of the single mutants form a substantially reduced amount of dimers compared with Hβ1, the dimers that do form retain the native conformation. The exception is repeat 3 (Hβ1[D3]). Mutating that Asp leads to dimers that are not resistant to tryptic cleavage. The abundance of potential tryptic cleavage sites in the β sequence makes this assay extremely sensitive, since it only takes a small variation in the final structure of the protein to make some of these sites accessible to the enzyme. Therefore, changes in the three-dimensional structure of the Hβ1[D3] mutant could be very subtle. Fig. 4 shows the rate of formation of wild-type Hβ1γ2 dimers compared with Hβ1[D1], a moderately affected mutant shown in Fig. 2. Assembly of wild-type and mutant βγ is only linear for about 30 min. In this initially linear interval, Hβ1[D1]γ2 forms 28% as fast as Hβ1γ2. After 60 min, no more βγ is formed, even though only 20–30% of wild-type Hβ1 has dimerized. Hβ1[D1] dimerizes more slowly, but plateaus at the same time as wild type. The dimerization rate of three other mutants (Hβ1[D3], Hβ1[D4], and Hβ1[D5]) was also slowed to a degree consistent with the yield of βγ dimers, and all plateaued at 30 min (data not shown). The observation that both wild-type and mutant β stop dimerizing before available monomers are depleted suggests that a necessary component in the reticulocyte lysate is depleted or degraded. Adding fresh lysate increases the yield of mutant and wild-type βγ proportionately (about 2-fold) but does not overcome the difference. Adding fresh lysate did not cause synthesis of β or γ to resume (data not shown). The inefficiency of dimerization of Gβ and Gγ in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate suggests that the missing or labile comp"

For the leucine-based signals, an interaction with AP-1 and AP-2 has been reported, but no specific interacting subunit has been demonstrated. After searching for molecules interacting with the leucine-based sorting signals within the cytosolic tail of the major histocompatibility complex class II-associated invariant chain using a phage display approach, we identified phage clones with homology to a conserved region of the AP-1 and AP-2 μ chains. To investigate the relevance of these findings, we have expressed regions of mouse μ1 and μ2 chains on phage gene product III and investigated the binding to tail sequences from various transmembrane proteins with known endosomal targeting signals. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent binding assays showed that these phages specifically recognized peptides containing functional leucine- and tyrosine-based sorting signals, suggesting that these regions of the μ1 and μ2 chains interact with both types of sorting signals.

The cytosolic tails of membrane proteins contain the information for targeting to various intracellular destinations. Two main classes of endosomal sorting signals have been identified: one class characterized by an essential tyrosine and one by a double leucine (LL) motif or variants thereof (1Sandoval I.V.

There is increasing evidence that both classes of sorting signals interact directly with the adaptor complexes AP-1 and AP-2 for clathrin-dependent sorting from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 1The abbreviations used are: TGN,trans-Golgi network; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; gp, glycoprotein; TfR, transferrin receptor; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ALP, alkaline phosphatase. or the plasma membrane, respectively (3Pearse B.M.F.

Studies on adaptor complexes binding to tail columns indicate a multivalent attachment of aggregated complexes with a binding constant in the micromolar range (3Pearse B.M.F.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), suggesting a model where binding to the signals is associated with clustering of the adaptors. In fact, adaptor complexes tend to aggregate and drive the formation of coats in vitro (12Beck K.A. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4437-4441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a requirement for AP clustering is in agreement with the current model where adaptors are first recruited to the membrane by a docking protein and then associate to form a coat to where the membrane proteins diffuse laterally. A specific interacting subunit of the AP complexes was recently demonstrated for the tyrosine-based signals as they were shown to interact with both μ1 and μ2, the medium chain subunits of AP-1 and AP-2, respectively (10Boll W.

No such interaction was demonstrated for the leucine class signals in those assays, although there are data indicating that these also mediate binding to the AP complexes (9Heilker R. Manning-Krieg U. Zuber J.F. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The latest information about how signals may be recognized by the sorting machinery was obtained using the yeast two-hybrid system (13Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), a library-based method for studying protein-protein interactions. We have used phage display technology as an alternative library-based approach to obtain more information about protein sequences recognizing leucine-based signals. Phage display of random peptides has in several cases been successfully applied to obtain detailed information about protein interactions (14Cortese R. Monaci P. Luzzago A. Santini C. Bartoli F.

In this report, we investigated these findings by expressing the corresponding μ domains at the phage surface and found that they are able to discriminate between wild-type and mutant leucine- and tyrosine-based signals. The 10-mer fUSE5 library with a complexity of 2 × 107 primary phage clones has been described previously (18Gebhardt K. Lauvrak V. Babaie E. Eijsink V. Lindqvist B.H. Pept. Res. 1996; 9: 269-278PubMed Google Scholar). The fUSE5 and fUSE2 phages and theEscherichia coli bacterial strains K91K and MC1061 were generous gifts from G. P. Smith (University of Missouri). The screening procedure was modified from that of Smith and Scott (19Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) and has been discussed in detail elsewhere (20Bremnes, T., Lauvrak, V., Lindqvist, B. H., and Bakke, O.Immunotechnology, in press.Google Scholar). Briefly, the invariant chain tail peptide1MDDQRDLISNNEQL14K was biotinylated before binding to SoftLink avidin resin (Promega), a methacrylate polymeric matrix with covalently bound monomeric avidin. One round of panning was performed as follows. The SoftLink-bound peptide was blocked for 1 h in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1% BSA before incubation with the fUSE5 phage for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing in PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.02% Tween (7–10 times), the bound phages were eluted with glycine HCl, pH 2.2. The eluate was amplified in K91K bacteria and polyethylene glycol-precipitated before a new round of panning was performed. Single clones were grown in LB medium containing 20 μg/ml tetracycline and examined for binding to the invariant chain peptide by ELISA (see below). The μ1phage was made by making the oligonucleotide 5′-tcggccgacggggcc cga gac aac ttt gtc atc atc tac gag ctg cta gat gag ctc atg gac ttt ggg tac ccg cag acc act gac ggg gccgctggggccgaaact-3′ double-stranded by polymerase chain reaction, cutting withSfiI, and cloning into a SfiI site in the phage gpIII gene (underlined regions are flanking sequences, and coding region are shown as triplets).

All oligonucleotides were synthesized at the Biotechnology Center (Oslo, Norway). Polymerase chain reaction was carried out on 5-μl supernatants from single colonies of phage-infected K91K using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc.). The primers for polymerase chain reaction were biotin-5′-tcgaaagcaagctgataaaccg-3′ and 5′-gtacaaaccacaacgcctgtag-3′. Single-stranded templates were isolated on magnetic streptavidin beads (M280, Dynal, Inc.), and single-stranded sequencing was done using the Sequenase 2.0 kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the sequencing primer 5′-ccctcatagttagcgtaacg-3′ (19Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). MaxiSorp wells (Nunc) were coated with peptide in PBS, pH 7.4, overnight at 4 °C or at room temperature at concentrations of 500 μg/ml for free peptides and 250 μg/ml for BSA-coupled peptides before blocking in PBS containing 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. 20% methanol was added to free peptides during coating as this seemed to improve both binding and specificity in the assays for some of the peptides. Phage was added in PBS and 1% BSA for 2 h at room temperature at different concentrations. 1010 phages, calculated as transducing units on K91K bacteria, correspond to a phage concentration (in transducing units) of 133 pm. Phage concentrations above 300 pm were not used in these assays as they only resulted in a marked increase in background problems. The plates were washed extensively in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 before horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added for 1 h at room temperature (1:5000 in PBS and 1% BSA). Another extensive wash was performed in PBS/Tween 20 before the addition of 100 μl of substrate (1 mg/ml ABTS (Boehringer Mannhein) in citrate buffer, pH 4.0), and the plates were read at 405 nm in a Titertek Multiskan plate reader. Table I gives an overview of all peptides used and their abbreviations and sequences. The invariant chain peptides Ii LI wt (where wt is wild type) and Ii DQ-AA/LI-AA were synthesized at the Biotechnology Center. The BSA-coupled sequences from the tail of the transferrin receptor (TfR wt and TfR Y-A), TGN38 (TGN38 wt and TGN38 Y-A), and the invariant chain (Ii ML wt and Ii ML-AA) as well as the BSA-conjugated C5 control sequence and unconjugated C1 (μ10) and C2 (μ15) were kindly provided by Dr. G. Banting (Bristol, United Kingdom). The Lamp-1 (lysosomal associatedmembrane protein 1) peptides Lamp-1 wt and Lamp-1 Y-A were gifts from Dr. W. Hunziker (Lausanne, Switzerland), and the CD3γ peptides CD3γ wt and CD3γ LL-AA were gifts from Dr. C. Geisler (Copenhagen, Denmark). The control peptides C3 and C4 were synthesized by Genosys Biotechnologies Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Amino acid analysis of the BSA conjugates was performed by Dr. K. Sletten (Biotechnology Center), showing that similar amounts of peptide were coupled per BSA for the wild type and its corresponding mutant. This was done to ensure that lack of/reduced binding in the assays not was due to different amounts of peptides. To ensure that free peptides equally coated the MaxiSorp wells and gave similar results as BSA-coupled peptides, we performed a binding assay with free Ii ML wt and Ii ML-AA peptides. These were biotinylated and HPLC-purified (Dr. G. Banting), and the coating efficiency for the wild type compared with the mutant was measured using horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin. These experiments showed that similar binding curves were obtained with free and BSA-coupled peptides and that the two peptides equally coated the MaxiSorp wells. This was as expected since large differences in coating efficiency due to small differences in sequence are usually a problem only with very short peptides (5–6 residues).Table ITail sequences and control peptides used in ELISAs with phage clones expressing the μ regionsAbbreviationSequenceProtein derivationBinds μ clonesLeucine-based signals Ii LI wt1MDDQRDLISNNEQL14KInvariant chain+++ Ii DQ-AA/LI-AA1MDAARDAASNNEQL14K− Ii ML wtBSA-C10NNEQLPMLGRR20Invariant chain+++ Ii ML-AABSA-C10NNEQLPAAGRR20+/− CD3γwtBIO-C116DGVRQSRASDKQTLL131CD3γ chain+++ CD3γLL-AABIO-C116DGVRQSRASDKQTAA131−Tyrosine-based signals Lamp-1 wt397RKRSHAGYQTT407Lysosomal Lamp-1+++ Lamp-1 Y-A397RKRSHAGAQTT407− TfRwtBSA-C16EPLSYTRFSLAR27Transferrin receptor+++ TfR Y-ABSA-C16EPLSATRFSLAR27− TGN38 wtBSA-C346KASDYQRLNLKL357Golgi TGN38+++ TGN38 Y-ABSA-C346KASDAQRLNLKL357+/−Control peptides C1 (μ10)18MDFGYPQTTD127Mouse μ1 chain− C2 (μ15)13LLDELMDFGYPQTTD127Mouse μ1chain− C3SAWRHPQSGGNone− C4PWGWLGISATNone− C5BSA-CKNLVLPADLFPNQEKNone− Open table in a new tab Conjugation of peptides to alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was essentially done as described previously (18Gebhardt K. Lauvrak V. Babaie E. Eijsink V. Lindqvist B.H. Pept. Res. 1996; 9: 269-278PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the μ peptides μ10 and μ15 and the control peptide C3 were dissolved to 140 μg/ml in PBS, pH 7.4, before ALP (25 mg/ml) was added to a molar ratio of 1:20 (ALP/peptide) for 1 h at room temperature. 50 μl of glutaraldehyde in PBS was added, and the tube was further incubated for 2 h at room temperature before adding glycine (1m). The conjugates were purified by filtration with Centricon 100 spin columns (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) and concentrated to a final concentration of 0.25 mg/ml. Amino acid analysis of the conjugates showed that, on average, seven peptides were coupled per ALP molecule. The binding assay was performed as follows. MaxiSorp plates were coated and blocked as described for phage binding assays. ALP-peptide conjugate was added in PBS and 1% BSA to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Free ALP and ALP-C3 were added at the same concentration to control wells. Phages were biotinylated with a large molar excess of biotin for 3–4 h at room temperature and then dialyzed overnight in PBS, pH 7.4, to remove free biotin. Biotin-labeled phages at a fixed concentration were allowed to interact with MaxiSorp plates coated with tail sequences in the presence or absence of an excess of unlabeled phage (up to 300 pm; see above). Binding of biotin-labeled phage was detected using horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin and horseradish peroxidase substrate. After screening a random fUSE5 display library against a peptide derived from the 15 N-terminal amino acids of Ii including an LI sorting signal, we identified phage-displayed peptides with homology to a region of the medium chain adaptor subunits (μ) (20Bremnes, T., Lauvrak, V., Lindqvist, B. H., and Bakke, O.Immunotechnology, in press.Google Scholar). One phage clone expressing the residues GFPQ in its gpIII insert (Fig. 1, Phage clone 1) was found to interact strongly with the Ii peptide used in the screening (Ii LI wt), suggesting that this clone could recognize the LI-type endosomal sorting signal of Ii. Homology searches in the SwissProt data base with sequences derived from the interacting phage led us to a conserved region of the medium chain adaptor subunit (μ) (Fig. 1). Other isolated phage clones from the screening also showed similarity to the same part of the μ chain region (Fig. 1, Phage clones 2–4). We wanted to investigate the relevance of the homologies between the phage clones and the μ chains by expressing a region from mouse μ1 in fUSE5 gpIII and testing its ability to recognize the invariant chain LI signal. A secondary structure prediction on mouse μ1 using the Chou and Fasman method (Ref. 22Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar; see Ref. 21Gribskov M. Burgess R.R. Devereux J.

By running the ANTIGENIC algorithm (23Kolaskar A.S. Tongaonkar P.C. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 172-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar) on the protein, the region was predicted to be antigenic, suggesting that it is surface-exposed. Based on the sequence comparisons and these structural predictions, region 104–127 from mouse μ1 could form a functional domain at the phage surface. The phage clone was made by inserting an oligonucleotide encoding the region 104–127 of mouse μ1 into phage gene III as described under “Experimental Procedures” (referred to as the μ1 clone; see Table II). As shown in Fig. 2 A, the μ1clone recognized the wild-type LI-containing peptide in a saturation-dependent fashion, whereas binding to the alanine mutant was not significantly higher than to BSA alone. Interestingly, the μ1 clone discriminated between the two peptides better than the GFPQ clone isolated after screening (data not shown), indicating that the μ1 clone is more adapted to the leucine signal than the clone from a limited random library. To test if the μ1 clone could bind to a broader range of leucine-based sorting signals, we also used peptides based on the second leucine signal in the Ii cytosolic tail (Ii ML wt) (15Pond L.

Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 (B and C), the μ1 sequence could also discriminate these wild-type tail sequences from their corresponding alanine mutants. The μ1 clone showed a higher interaction above background levels with these mutants compared with the Ii DQ-AA/LI-AA peptide. This may be due to interactions with additional amino acids in peptides where only the crucial leucine core motifs are changed to alanine (Table I).Table IIPhage clones and ALP conjugatesClone/conjugateSequenceBindingPhage clones μ1cloneNH2-ADGARDNFVIIYELLDELMDFGYPQTTDGAAGE++++ μ1AAAANH2-ADGARDNFVIIYELLDELMDFAAAATTDGAAGE++ μ2cloneNH2-ADGAKNNFVLIYELLDEILDFGYPQNSEGAAGE++++ μ212NNH2-ADGAKNNFVLIYELLDGAAGE−ALP conjugates ALP-μ15ALP-(LLDELMDFGYPQTTD)n 2-2001n denotes the average number of peptides coupled per ALP molecule and was estimated by amino acid analysis to be in the range 5–9 for all conjugates.+++ ALP-μ10ALP-(MDFGYPQTTD)n+++ ALP-C3ALP-(SAWRHPQSGG)n− ALPALP-(no peptide)−2-2001 n denotes the average number of peptides coupled per ALP molecule and was estimated by amino acid analysis to be in the range 5–9 for all conjugates. Open table in a new tab Neither a fUSE2 control phage nor irrelevant fUSE5 clones gave signals in ELISA, even at high titers, confirming that other domains on the phage surface do not bind tail sequences. Microtiter wells coated with irrelevant control peptides gave signals below the BSA background level, even though some contained double leucines, tyrosines, or other residues usually present in signals (Table I). This shows that the context of the residues is important for binding and that the binding is not due to nonspecific interactions with bulky hydrophobic residues. The Tyr-based sorting motifs are the most studied, and it is well established that proteins with these motifs bind adaptors. We therefore decided to include some Tyr-based signals in our assay, and we found that the μ1 phage clone could discriminate wild-type Lamp-1 (25Harter C. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), TGN38 (26Luzio J.P. Brake B. Banting G. Howell K.E. Braghetta P. Stanley K.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and TfR (27Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S.Q. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) from their corresponding alanine mutants (Fig. 2, D–F). The binding curves showed saturation characteristics at the higher concentration of phages. The μ1 region (amino acids 104–127) is very similar to the corresponding region in μ2 (amino acids 102–125), with the differences being mostly conservative changes (Fig. 1). To test the mouse μ2 homologue, region 102–125 was cloned into phage gpIII (μ2 clone) (TableII). As shown in Fig. 3, the characteristics of the binding between the μ2 clone and the tail sequences are almost identical to what we obtained for the μ1 clone. This suggests that the region we have identified is involved in signal recognition by both AP-1 μ1 and AP-2 μ2. NMR data on the Ii tail has earlier demonstrated that a nascent α-helix in the N-terminal part of the Ii tail is stabilized in 20% methanol (17Motta A. Bremnes B. Morelli M.A.C. Frank R.W. Saviano G. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27165-27171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Other peptides have also been shown to stabilize their folding in the presence of organic cosolvents (28Dyson H.J. Sayre J.R. Merutka G. Shin H.C. Lerner R.A. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 819-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 29Dyson H.J. Merutka G. Waltho J.P. Lerner R.A. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 795-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that methanol added to 20% during the coating of wells with unconjugated peptides increased the specificity of binding between free tail peptides and the μ clones (data not shown). This was observed in particular for the CD3γ peptides, for which we observed clear differences in binding only when methanol was present during coating. The signal obtained against Ii wt seemed to increase with methanol added during the coating, whereas the lack of binding to the mutant Ii peptide was very clear both with and without methanol. Based on these observations, we suggest that methanol could give the peptides a more native conformation when locked on the surface of the wells. Methanol added to the BSA conjugates seemed to enhance nonspecific interactions, possibly due to misfolding of these proteins. BSA coupling is an approach used to ensure equal binding when coating a solid phase with small proteins or peptides (30Tijssen P. Burdon R.H. Van Knippenberg P.H. Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1985Google Scholar). Amino acid analysis of our BSA conjugates showed that similar amounts of peptides were coupled for a wild type and its corresponding mutant. We can therefore rule out that the lack of/reduced binding to mutant peptides was due to the lack of primary attachment of these to the MaxiSorp wells or lack of peptide on the conjugates. Furthermore, Ii ML wt and Ii ML-AA peptides not coupled to BSA gave binding curves similar to those shown for Ii ML peptides in Fig. 2 B. The free Ii ML peptides (which were biotinylated and HPLC-purified) were found to coat the MaxiSorp wells at equal efficiencies (see “Experimental Procedures”), showing that changing the ML residues to alanine did not affect the ability to attach to MaxiSorp wells. To investigate whether binding could also be obtained with a shorter sequence containing the GYPQ motif and when not expressed as a phage fusion product, we coupled the μ peptides μ10 and μ15 (Table I) to alkaline phosphatase as described. Amino acid analysis of the ALP-μ conjugate showed that, on average, seven peptides were coupled to each ALP molecule, giving a multivalence corresponding to that in the fUSE5 phage (four copies of gpIII). Fig. 4 (A and B) shows ALP-μ10 binding to the tail sequences Ii ML wt and TGN38 wt, to their corresponding mutants, and to BSA. Similar results were obtained for other tail sequences tested, both for ALP-μ10 and ALP-μ15 (data not shown). As shown, neither unconjugated ALP nor ALP coupled to an irrelevant control peptide (C3 in Table II) interacted with the tail peptides. In conclusion, the ALP conjugates bound to both tyrosine- and leucine-based signals, confirming that shorter sequences than the 24-residue region in our μ phage clones containing the GFPQ sequence could recognize the signals and that the peptide sequences do not necessarily have to be expressed on the phage. To investigate if the GYPQ residues are involved in binding to the tail sequences, we constructed a fUSE5 μ1 clone with these 4 residues changed to alanines (μ1 AAAA) (Table II). The ELISA binding curves for the wild-type μ1 clone versus the alanine mutant showed a reduced binding for the alanine mutant compared with the wild type (Fig. 5 A). To quantitate the difference in binding between the wild-type μ1 clone and μ1 AAAA, we performed a titration at a point on the binding curve at the first point of saturation (corresponding to a phage concentration of 20 pm in Fig. 5 A). Phages were bound to wells coated with the Ii peptide, eluted by glycine HCl, and then titrated by means of counting transducing units. The average results from four titrations with S.D. values are shown in Fig. 5 B. When equal amounts of the different phage clones (as calculated from transducing units) were coated onto MaxiSorp wells and detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phage antibody, equal ELISA signals were obtained, showing that the number of phages as calculated from transducing units may be used as an accurate measure of the actual number of phage particles (data not shown). This was checked because different phage clones might have different efficiencies of infection, giving different titers at the same number of actual particles. According to the titration data, the binding was 60% reduced at saturation for μ1 AAAA compared with the wild-type μ1 clone. Since the binding was not completely abolished, there may be other determinants in the cloned region that also contribute to binding or facilitate a functional structure. A fUSE5 clone expressing the first half of the 24-amino acid motif (μ2 12N) (Table II) was made to check whether the highly conserved upstream residues alone could mediate binding. This clone, however, gave no signal above the BSA level when tested against the various signal peptides (data not shown). By developing a competition assay based on biotinylated μ1 phages, we also showed that when adding a 10-fold excess of unlabeled μ1 phage, we observed a significant inhibition in binding, but not when adding the same amount of unlabeled μ1 AAAA phage (Fig. 6). These results strongly indicate that the GYPQ residues are important for recognition of sorting signals. While the tyrosine-based signals are shown to interact with the medium chain adaptor subunits (μ) as well as with intact AP complexes (9Heilker R. Manning-Krieg U. Zuber J.F. Spiess M.

https://openalex.org/W2020547495,"Nuclear factor κB1 (NF-κB) is a heterodimeric complex that regulates transcription of many genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Its 50-kDa subunit (p50) is generated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway from a 105-kDa precursor (p105). We have reconstituted this proteolytic process in HeLa cell extracts and purified the responsible enzymes. Ubiquitination of p105 requires E1, and either of two types of E2s, E2–25K (for which p105 is the first proven substrate) or a member of the UBCH5 (UBC4) family. It also requires a new E3 of 50 kDa, which we call E3κB. This set of enzymes differs from the E2s and E3 reported by others to catalyze p105 ubiquitination in reticulocytes. The ubiquitinating enzymes purified here, together with 26S proteasomes, allowed formation of p50. Thus, the 26S proteasome provides all the proteolytic activities necessary for p105 processing. Interestingly, in the reconstituted system, as observed in cells, the C-terminally truncated form of p105, p97, was processed into p50 more efficiently than normal p105, even when both species were ubiquitinated to a similar extent. Therefore, some additional mechanism involving the C-terminal region of p105 influences the proteolytic processing of the ubiquitinated precursor.

Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). Greater knowledge about the mechanisms of NF-κB activation is therefore of major importance for understanding human disease and may indicate new targets for pharmacological intervention. NF-κB is a member of the Rel family of dimeric transcription factors present in many organisms (2Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar). The prototype of this family is a heterodimer of a p50 (NF-κB1) and a p65 (RelA) subunit. Its activity is regulated primarily at the posttranslational level, by two separate processes (3Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). The p50 subunit is generated from a relatively stable precursor, p105, which undergoes proteolytic processing in the cytoplasm (4Blank V. Kourilsky P. Israel A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4159-4167Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 5Fan C.M. Maniatis T. Nature. 1991; 354: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 6Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). In this process, the C-terminal part of p105 is degraded, and the remaining N-terminal half of the molecule serves as the p50 subunit of NF-κB. However, in uninduced cells, the p50/p65 (NF-κB) complex is maintained in an inactive form in the cytoplasm by the inhibitor IκBα, which associates with p50/p65 and prevents its migration to the nucleus (7Baeuerle P.A.

Previous data have shown that the processing of the p105 precursor and the degradation of IκBα both require ubiquitin (Ub) conjugation to these polypeptides, leading to their proteolytic digestion by the 26S proteasome (6Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar, 14Chen Z.J. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D.

The Ub-proteasome system is a major pathway for degradation of intracellular proteins in eukaryotic cells (22Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar, 23Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). In this pathway, substrates are marked for degradation by covalent attachment of poly-Ub chain(s) (24Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). In this process, the Ub-activating protein, E1, utilizes ATP to form a high energy Ub-thiol ester and then transfers the activated Ub to an E2 (Ub carrier protein (UBC)), forming an E2-Ub thiol ester. The Ub is then linked to the substrate in a reaction requiring E3, a Ub-protein ligase (24Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar, 25Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Cells contain a large number of E2s (23Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar), each of which acts on a limited spectrum of protein substrates (26King R.W. Peters J.M. Tugendreich S. Rolfe M. Hieter P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 27Aristarkhov A. Eytan E. Moghe A. Admon A. Hershko A. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4294-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The E3s seem to provide most of the substrate specificity of the ubiquitination process, although only a limited number have been identified. Once ubiquitinated, proteins are usually rapidly degraded to small peptides by the 26S proteasome (22Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). The proteolytic core of this 2000-kDa complex is the 20S proteasome (28Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar), which is sandwiched at each end by the 19S complex (PA700) (29Peters J.M. Franke W.W. Kleinschmidt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7709-7718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Chu-Ping M. Vu J.H. Proske R.J. Slaughter C.A. Demartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3539-3547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 19S complex contains multiple activities, including an isopeptidase that catalyzes the release of free Ub (31Eytan E. Armon T. Heller H. Beck S. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4668-4674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kam Y.A. Xu W. Demartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and several ATPases, the likely function of which is to facilitate the unfolding of substrates and their translocation into the 20S proteasome (33Rubin D.M. Finley D. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 854-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), where degradation proceeds in a processive fashion (34Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The finding that the Ub-proteasome pathway is responsible for the limited processing of p105 was quite surprising, because its other known substrates undergo complete degradation. To dissect the mechanisms of this process and to define its components, we undertook to identify the enzymes necessary for p105 ubiquitination and p50 generation in HeLa cell extracts and to reconstitute this process with purified proteins.

Peters (Harvard Medical School). HeLa cell cytoplasmic extracts were centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g (4 °C) to remove debris. The supernatant was dialyzed against 3 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol and loaded onto a DE52 column equilibrated with the same buffer. The flow-through (fraction I) was collected, the column was washed with the equilibration buffer supplemented with 20 mm KCl, and the bound proteins (fraction II) were eluted with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol. FII was dialyzed overnight against the same buffer without KCl. In some experiments, FI and FII were prepared from extracts depleted of proteasomes by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 5 h or 200,000 ×g for 3 h (4 °C). In those cases, after sedimentation of the proteasomes, MgCl2 and ATP were omitted in the buffers used to prepare the FII. Ubiquitin was covalently bound to a CH-activated Sepharose matrix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as recommended by the manufacturer. The final concentration of ubiquitin was about 20 mg/ml of gel. Fraction II was supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP and mixed with the Ub-Sepharose for 1 h at room temperature (with shaking). The ubiquitinating enzymes were sequentially eluted as follows (41Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Tamura T. Tanaka K.

Pellets obtained by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 3 h of the HeLa cytoplasmic extracts were resuspended in Buffer A (50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmEDTA, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was centrifuged again at 200,000 × g for 30 min to remove polysomes. The supernatant was loaded onto a MonoQ 10/10 column equilibrated with Buffer A, and the proteins were eluted with a NaCl gradient (0–500 mm). The fractions were assayed for activity against the fluorogenic proteasome substrate Suc-LLVY-MCA (Bachem). The active fractions (≈320 mmNaCl) were pooled, diluted twice in Buffer A, and loaded onto a MonoQ 5/5 column. The proteins were eluted with a 200–500 mmNaCl gradient. Fractions active against Suc-LLVY-MCA were pooled and concentrated using a Centricon-50 (Amicon) concentrator and loaded onto a Superose 6 column equilibrated with Buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. 20S and 26S proteasomes were identified by their activity against Suc-LLVY-MCA in the presence or absence of 0.02% SDS. At this concentration, SDS greatly activates the 20S proteasomes but inhibits the 26S proteasomes, allowing easy discrimination of the two forms (43Hough R. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8303-8313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions containing 26S proteasomes and 20S proteasomes were pooled separately and stored frozen at −70 °C. The p105T, p97T, and p60Tth constructs (5Fan C.M. Maniatis T. Nature. 1991; 354: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) were generously provided by Dr. Tom Maniatis (Harvard University). The proteins were translated in vitro in a wheat germ extract using the coupled transcription/translation TNT system of Promega, as recommended by the manufacturer. Unless specified otherwise, the reaction mixture was diluted 3-fold after translation in the assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT), and the labeled protein was separated from the free [35S]methionine using a Nick Spin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in the same buffer.

Read (ProScript).Figure 8Comparison of the ubiquitination and processing of the truncated version p97 and the full-length p105. A, the processing of p97 is more efficient than the processing of p105. The ubiquitination and conversion of p97 or p105 to p50 were monitored at 37 °C in an 80-μl reaction. At the times indicated, 20 μl were removed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The substrates were incubated in the presence of 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mg/ml Ub, 10 μg/ml human E1, 2 μm of each recombinant E2–25K and UBCH5C, and an ATP-regenerating system. The source of E3κB was the FII depleted of ubiquitinating enzymes by Ub-affinity chromatography and of proteasomes by ultracentrifugation (5 μl (about 20 μg of protein) per 20 μl of reaction mixture). The translation mixtures containing p97 or p105 were diluted 20-fold. As indicated at the bottom of the figure, either buffer (−26S) or 2 μg of purified HeLa cell 26S proteasome (+26S) was added. B, although ubiquitination of p105 and p97 was similar, processing was less efficient for ubiquitinated p105. The ubiquitination and processing of p97 (1 μl of the undiluted translation mixture) (left) and p105 (0.5 μl of the undiluted translation mixture) (right) were monitored as in Fig. 7 A. The following enzymes were added: E2s, 2 μm final concentration of E2–25K and UBCH5C; E3, 4 μl of purified E3κB; 26S, 2 μg of purified HeLa cell 26S proteasomes. The bottom two panels show quantification using a Fujix Bas 1000 (Fuji) of the radioactivity that accumulated in each lane as p50 or as ubiquitinated proteins (brackets). In each case, the values obtained in the absence of E3κB and of proteasomes were subtracted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Unless specified otherwise, reactions were carried out in the assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT) supplemented with other components as indicated. When the processing of p105 was studied, an ATP-regenerating system (0.1 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 10 mm creatine phosphate) was added. The products were separated by SDS-PAGE (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and the gels were dried and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) or a Fujix Bas 1000 (Fuji) and autoradiography. Reactions were carried out for 10 min at 37 °C in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm DTT in the presence of 125I-labeled Ub (50–100 μg/ml) and 50 units/ml of inorganic pyrophosphatase. Reactions were stopped by addition of 1 volume of 2× sample buffer (120 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 4 m urea, 20% glycerol) containing or not containing 100 mm DTT. The products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Prior studies have shown that p105 and its C-terminally truncated forms p60 and p97 can be converted into the NF-κB subunit p50, when expressed in cells or added to crude cell extracts (5Fan C.M. Maniatis T. Nature. 1991; 354: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 6Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). To learn more about this process,35S-labeled p60, translated in WGE, was added to a cytoplasmic extract (S100) of HeLa cells, and its fate was analyzed at different times by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 1). Within minutes, very high molecular weight forms of p60 appeared, which entered the resolving gel only slightly. This heterogenous 35S-labeled material then disappeared concomitantly with an increase in the mature, processed p50 (although some p50 also appeared within 5 min of p60 addition). Thus the high molecular weight forms behave like intermediates in the proteolytic processing of p60 and probably correspond to ubiquitinated forms of p60. To verify this conclusion, the extract was supplemented with various recombinant species of Ub: wild-type Ub; UbR48, a mutated form of Ub that has a defect in Ub chain formation due to the replacement of lysine 48 by an arginine (45Finley D. Sadis S. Monia B.P. Boucher P. Ecker D.J. Crooke S.T. Chau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5501-5509Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) (both with a His6 tag); and GST-Ub, a hybrid molecule in which the enzyme glutathioneS-transferase has been fused to the N-terminal end of normal Ub (36Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). Addition of the modified Ub species significantly altered the events from those seen upon addition of normal Ub. With UbR48, we found p60 conjugates of reduced size (data not shown), probably because of the premature termination of the Ub-chain due to the K48R mutation. Moreover, addition of UbR48 to the crude extract inhibited the production of p50, although this inhibition was not complete, probably due to the presence of endogenous normal Ub in this extract. These observations are consistent with previous work showing that UbR48 inhibits p105 processing (6Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the effect of UbR48 on p105 ubiquitination and processing rules out a possible explanation of how p105 may be converted to p50: that p105 is modified by addition of an atypical type of poly-Ub chain, which directs the protein toward limited processing instead of complete degradation. Indeed, lysine 48 of Ub is the residue commonly used for complete degradation of proteins by the proteasome (45Finley D. Sadis S. Monia B.P. Boucher P. Ecker D.J. Crooke S.T. Chau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5501-5509Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the presence of GST-Ub, bands of very high molecular weight accumulated (data not shown, see below), which presumably correspond to poly-GST-Ub adducts of p60 because GST-Ub is about four times larger than normal Ub. Because the type of Ub added determined the size of the high molecular weight derivatives of p60, these derivatives must represent Ub-conjugated forms of the molecule. Furthermore, when the same extract was incubated with ATPγS, an ATP analog that supports ubiquitination of proteins but not the proteolytic activity of the 26S complex (46Scheffner M. Munger K. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2425-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), high molecular weight ubiquitinated forms of p60 accumulated, but p50 was not formed (data not shown). A similar accumulation of ubiquitinated species was obtained when the extract was depleted of proteasomes by prolonged ultracentrifugation, before being incubated with ATP (Fig. 2). These results confirm that the ubiquitinated species are indeed intermediates in the production of the p50 subunit, as was proposed previously (6Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar, 47Orian A. Whiteside S. Israel A. Stancovski I. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21707-21714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To identify the enzymes required for the formation of these Ub conjugates, the HeLa extract was loaded onto a DE52 column (Whatman). The proteins that did not bind (FI) were collected and, after washing the column, the bound proteins (FII) were eluted with 0.5 m KCl. After extensive dialysis, both fractions were assayed for their ability to support the processing of p60 into p50. In accord with previous findings (6Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar) with FII from rabbit reticulocytes, we found that HeLa FII, when supplemented with Ub, was fully competent at p50 formation (Fig. 2). Moreover, the addition of FI did not increase the yield of p50 (Fig. 2). Thus, it is most likely that the HeLa FII contains all of the enzymes necessary for NF-κB1 processing. It has been reported that FI (from reticulocytes) contains an E2 essential for p105 processing and that this E2 could also be provided in the reaction by the WGE in which p60 (or p105) is translated (47Orian A. Whiteside S. Israel A. Stancovski I. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21707-21714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, our subsequent experiments clearly showed that HeLa FII contains E2 and E3 ubiquitination enzymes supporting p60 (or p105) ubiquitination and processing. FII was then further fractionated to isolate the enzymes active in p60 ubiquitination. Ammonium sulfate precipitation resolved two fractions that independently had some activity in ubiquitinating p60 (data not shown): FIIA, which precipitated between 0 and 40% (NH4)2SO4, and FIIB, which precipitated between 40 and 90% (NH4)2SO4. However, mixing these two fractions resulted in more than an additive effect in promoting p60 ubiquitination (data not shown). Thus, each of these fractions appeared to be enriched in distinct component(s) of the ubiquitination pathway. These components were then further purified by anion-exchange chromatography of FIIA and FIIB, using a MonoQ column. To assay their ability to support ubiquitination of p60, each fraction derived from FIIA was combined with FIIB, and each from FIIB was combined with FIIA, in the presence of E1 and GST-Ub. We used GST-Ub rather than normal Ub because the larger conjugates formed with GST-Ub accumulate at the top of the acrylamide gel and are easily detected. After anion-exchange chromatography of FIIA and FIIB, two protein fractions were obtained: A (from FIIA), which eluted at about 250 mm NaCl, and B (from FIIB), which eluted at about 100 mm NaCl. These two fractions, when mixed, supported efficient formation of Ub conjugates when p60 or p105 was used as the substrate (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, the decrease in the p60 and p105 bands (which accounted for 30% or less of the substrate added, as analyzed with a PhosphorImager) could not account for the amount of labeled protein accumulating as conjugates. Therefore, the bands of lower molecular weight (most likely degradation products or products of premature termination of translation) apparently can also be ubiquitinated by these enzymes. The poly-ubiquitination of a substrate involves the successive thiol ester linkage of Ub to E1 and then to E2 and, in some cases, to E3 (24Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar,25Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Using 125I-Ub, such a thiol ester adduct can be detected after SDS-PAGE, provided that the sample is not exposed to a reducing agent. We analyzed fractions A and B for their content of enzymes capable of forming a thiol ester linkage with125I-Ub. As shown in Fig. 3 B, one DTT-sensitive band of about 110 kDa was detected in fraction A after electrophoresis. This band comigrated with the band formed when Ub was incubated with E1 purified from rabbit reticulocytes, and thus it corresponded to the human E1. No E2 could be detected in fraction A. In fraction B, no Ub-thiol ester could be detected, unless reticulocyte E1 was added. With E1 present, two Ub-protein adducts of about 27.5 and 33 kDa were evident under nonreducing conditions, but they disappeared if the sample was boiled in the presence of DTT. These two bands therefore must correspond to distinct ubiquitin carrier proteins (E2s) linked to Ub by a thiol ester. Finally, mixing fractions A and B allowed formation of the same two Ub-thiol esters, without exogenous E1 addition, and did not reveal any additional E2 (Fig. 3 B). In addition, some high molecular weight radiolabeled bands (Fig. 3 B, vertical bar) were formed that were DTT-resistant and therefore corresponded to Ub conjugates of proteins in fractions A and B. Neither fraction A, which contains E1, nor fraction B, which contains two E2s, was able by itself to conjugate Ub to p60 or p105, even if reticulocyte E1 was added (Fig. 3 A). Significant conjugation to p60 or p105 occurred only when fractions A and B were mixed. Thus, in addition to E1, fr"

The DnaB protein is an essential replication protein inEscherichia coli (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1992Google Scholar) which is involved in both the initiation and elongation stages of DNA replication (2Wickner S. Wright M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1992Google Scholar). In solution, the native DnaB protein exists as a stable hexamer, composed of six identical subunits (7Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Jezewska M.J. J. Biol.

Sedimentation velocity and electron microscopy studies reveal that the DnaB hexamer undergoes dramatic conformational changes upon binding AMP-PNP and ssDNA, and provide direct evidence of the presence of long range allosteric interactions in the hexamer, encompassing all six subunits of the enzyme (8Jezewska M.J.

Recently, we obtained the first estimate of the stoichiometry of the DnaB helicase-ssDNA complex and the mechanism of the binding (12Bujalowski W. Jezewska M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 13Jezewska M.J. Kim U-S. Bujalowski W.

J. 1996; 71: 2075-2086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Using the quantitative fluorescence titration method, we determined that the DnaB helicase binds ssDNA with a stoichiometry of 20 ± 3 nucleotides/DnaB hexamer and that this stoichiometry is independent of the type of nucleic acid base (13Jezewska M.J. Kim U-S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2129-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our thermodynamic studies of binding of ssDNA oligomers to the DnaB hexamer show that the enzyme has a single, strong binding site for ssDNA (12Bujalowski W. Jezewska M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The results also show that the same binding site is used in the binding to oligomers and polymer nucleic acids (12Bujalowski W. Jezewska M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 13Jezewska M.J. Kim U-S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2129-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Moreover, photo-cross-linking experiments indicate that the ssDNA binding site is located predominately, if not completely, on a single subunit of the hexamer (12Bujalowski W. Jezewska M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 13Jezewska M.J. Kim U-S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2129-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The reaction catalyzed by a helicase, the unwinding of a duplex DNA, must take place in the DNA binding site. The fact that the helicase uses the same single DNA binding site, when forming a complex with polymer ssDNAs, oligomers, and replication fork substrates, indicates a complex structure of the nucleic acid binding site that can accommodate both ssDNA and dsDNA. In this communication, we report the analysis of interactions between the DnaB helicase and DNA within the total DNA binding site of the enzyme. We present direct evidence that the total DNA binding site of the helicase is structurally and functionally heterogeneous. The total binding site is built of two subsites, each encompassing approximately 10 nucleotide residues. We provide direct proof that the DnaB hexamer binds ssDNA in a strictly single orientation, with respect to the polarity of the sugar-phosphate backbone of the nucleic acid. The results indicate that the binding subsites are sequentially located along the nucleic acid lattice, with the weak binding subsite constituting an entry site for the duplex part of the replication fork.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31359-31371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of the protein was spectrophotometrically determined, using extinction coefficient ε280 = 1.85 × 105cm−1m−1 (hexamer) (7Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Jezewska M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31350-31358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Replacement of the arginine residues at position 14 from the N terminus of the DnaB protein and obtaining the DnaB protein variant, R14C, were performed using the plasmid RLM1038, harboring the gene of the wild type DnaB helicase, generously provided by Dr. R. McMacken. The site-directed mutagenesis was accomplished in the NIEHS Center facility (National Institutes of Health) directed by Dr. T. Wood. Labeling of the 6 cysteine residues of the DnaB variant, R14C hexamer, with CPM was performed in H buffer (pH 8.1, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol) at 4 °C. The fluorescent label was added from the stock solution to the molar ratio of the CPM/R14C ∼25. The mixture was incubated for 4 h, with gentle mixing. After incubation, the protein was precipitated with ammonium sulfate and dialyzed overnight against buffer T2. Any remaining free dye was removed from the modified R14C-CPM by applying the sample on a DEAE-cellulose column and eluting with buffer T2 containing 500 mm NaCl. The degree of labeling was determined by absorbance of the marker at 394 nm using the extinction coefficient of CPM, ε394 = 27 × 103 cm−1m−1, providing the value of 5.8 ± 0.1 of CPM per DnaB hexamer. 2S. Rajendran, M. J. Jezewska, and W. Bujalowski, manuscript in preparation. All nucleic acids were purchased from Midland Certified Reagents (Midland, TX). The etheno-derivatives of nucleic acids were obtained by modification with chloroacetaldehyde (12Bujalowski W. Jezewska M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 18Secrist J.A. Bario J.R. Leonard N.J. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3499-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Oligomer dT(pT)19, labeled at the 5′-end with fluorescein, 5′-Fl-dT(pT)19, was synthesized using fluorescein phosphoramidate (Glen Research). Labeling of the 3′-end was performed by synthesizing dT(pT)19 with the last residue at the 3′-end of the oligomer having the amino group on a six-carbon linker. The amino group was subsequently modified with fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate to obtain dT(pT)19-Fl-3′. The degree of labeling was determined by absorbance at 494 nm (pH 9), using the extinction coefficient, 7.6 × 104m−1 cm−1 (13Jezewska M.J. Kim U-S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2129-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The same procedures were used for labeling the 5′- and 3′-ends of the dA(pA)9. The concentrations of labeled oligomers were spectrophotometrically determined at 260 nm (pH 8.1), using extinction coefficients, 1.76 × 105m−1cm−1 and 11.4 × 105m−1 cm−1, respectively (13Jezewska M.J. Kim U-S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2129-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The concentrations of dεA(pεA)9, dεA(pεA)8, dεA(pεA)7, dεA(pεA)6, dεA(pεA)5, dεA(pεA)4, and dεA(pεA)3 were determined using extinction coefficients 37 × 103, 33.3 × 103, 29.6 × 103, 25.9 × 103, 22.2 × 103, 18.5 × 103, and 14.8 × 103m−1 cm−1 at 257 nm, respectively (12Bujalowski W.

Labeling the 5′-ends of ssDNA oligomers with 32P was performed using the standard procedure (12Bujalowski W. Jezewska M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Analytical sedimentation experiments were performed using an Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Analyses of the sedimentation runs were performed as we previously described (8Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4261-4265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 9Reha-Krantz L.J. Hurwitz J. J. Biol.

The reported values of sedimentation coefficients were corrected to standard conditions,s20,w, for solvent density and viscosity (7Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Jezewska M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31350-31358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All steady-state fluorescence measurements were performed using the SLM-Aminco 48000S and 8100 spectrofluorometers (20Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 64: 253-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The emission spectra were corrected for a wavelength dependence of the instrument response using a software provided by the manufacturer. The binding of the DnaB protein was followed by monitoring the fluorescence of the etheno-derivatives of ssDNA oligomers (λex = 325 nm, λem = 410 nm). All titration points were corrected for dilution and, if necessary, for inner filter effect using the formula (15Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5888-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), Ficor=(Fi−Bi)ViVo100.5b(Aiλex)Equation 1 where Ficor is the corrected value of the fluorescence intensity at a given point of titration i, Fi is the experimentally measured fluorescence intensity, Bi is the background, Vi is the volume of the sample at a given titration point, Vo is the initial volume of the sample, b is the total length of the optical path in the cuvette expressed in centimeters, and Aiλex is the absorbance of the sample at the excitation wavelength. Computer fits were performed using KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software, PA) and Mathematica (Wolfram Research, IL). The relative fluorescence increase of the nucleic acid, ΔF, upon binding the DnaB protein is defined by the equation, ΔF=(Ficor−Fo)FoEquation 2 where Ficor is defined by Equation 1, and Fo is the initial value of the fluorescence of the same solution. All steady-state fluorescence anisotropy measurements were performed in the L format, using Glan-Thompson polarizers placed in the excitation and emission channels. The fluorescence anisotropy, r, of the sample was calculated by the equation, r=(IVV−GIVH)(IVV+2GIVH)Equation 3 where I is the fluorescence intensity, and the first and second subscripts refer to vertical (V) polarization of the excitation and vertical (V) or horizontal (H) polarization of the emitted light (16Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4682-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The factor G = IHV/IHH corrects for the different sensitivity of the emission monochromator for vertically and horizontally polarized light (21Azumi T. McGlynn S.P. J. Chem. Phys. 1962; 37: 2413-2420Crossref Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The limiting fluorescence anisotropies of fluorophores,ro, were determined by measuring the anisotropy of a given sample at different solution viscosity, adjusted by sucrose or glycerol, and extrapolating to viscosity = ∞, using the Perrin equation (22Lakowicz J.R. Principle of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983: 111-339Google Scholar). The efficiency of the fluorescence radiationless energy transfer, E, from CPM (donor), located on the small 12-kDa domains of the DnaB protein variant R14C, to the fluorescein (acceptor), located at the 5′- or 3′-end of dT(pT)19, bound in the DNA binding site of the helicase, has been determined using two independent methods. The fluorescence of the donor in the presence of the acceptor, FDA, is related to the fluorescence of the same donor, FD, in the absence of the acceptor by the equation, FDA=(1−νD)FD+FDνD(1−ED)Equation 4 where νD is the fraction of donors in the complex with the acceptor, and ED is the average fluorescence energy transfer from donor to acceptor, determined from the quenching of the donor fluorescence. Thus, the average transfer efficiency,ED, obtained from the quenching of the CPM fluorescence upon binding of the labeled ssDNA oligomer, is obtained by rearranging Equation 4, ED=1νDFD−FDAFDEquation 5 where, in the considered case, FD and FDA are the values of the CPM fluorescence intensity in the absence and presence of bound 5′-Fl-dT(pT)19 or dT(pT)19-Fl-3′. The value of νD has been determined using the binding constants of the 20- and 10-mers for the DnaB helicase measured in the same solution conditions (13Jezewska M.J. Kim U-S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2129-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the second independent method, the average fluorescence transfer efficiency, EA, has been determined, using a sensitized acceptor fluorescence by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the acceptor (fluorescein) excited at 435 nm, where the donor (CPM) predominantly absorbs, in the absence and presence of R14C-CPM. The fluorescence intensities of the acceptor in the absence,FA, and presence, FAD, of the donor are defined as follows, FA=IoεACATφFAEquation 6 and FAD=(1−νA)FA+IoεAνACATφBA+IoεDCDTνDφBAEAEquation 7 where Io is the intensity of incident light,CAT and CDT are the total concentrations of acceptor and donor, νA is the fraction of acceptors in the complex with donors, εA and εD are the molar absorption coefficients of acceptor and donor at the excitation wavelength (435 nm), respectively; φFA and φBA are the quantum yields of the free and bound acceptor; and EA is the average transfer efficiency determined by acceptor-sensitized emission. All quantities in Equations 6 and 7 can be experimentally determined. For the case considered in this work, the acceptor is practically completely saturated with the donor, i.e. νA = 1. Thus, for νA = 1, dividing Equation 7 by Equation 6 and rearranging provides the average transfer efficiency as described by the following. EA=1νDεACATεDCDTφFAφBAFADFA−1Equation 8 It should be pointed out that the energy transfer efficiencies,ED and EA, are apparent quantities. ED is a fraction of the photons absent in the donor emission as a result of the presence of an acceptor, including transfer to the acceptor and possible nondipolar quenching processes induced by the presence of the acceptor, and EA is a fraction of all photons absorbed by the donor that were transferred to the acceptor. The true Förster energy transfer efficiency, E, is a fraction of photons absorbed by the donor and transferred to the acceptor in the absence of any additional nondipolar quenching resulting from the presence of the acceptor (22Lakowicz J.R. Principle of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983: 111-339Google Scholar). The value of E is related to the apparent quantities of ED and EA, by the following (23Berman H.A Yguerabide J. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2226-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). E=EA(1−ED+EA)Equation 9 Thus, measurements of the transfer efficiency, using both methods, are not alternatives but parts of the analysis used to obtain the true efficiency of the fluorescence energy transfer process,E. The fluorescence energy transfer efficiency between donor and acceptor dipoles is related to the distance, R, separating the dipoles by the equation, E=Ro6Ro6+R6Equation 10 where Ro = 9790 (κ2 n−4 φd J) 16 is the so called Förster critical distance (in angstroms), the distance at which the transfer efficiency is 50%; κ2 is the orientation factor; φd is the donor quantum yield in the absence of the acceptor; and n is the refractive index of the medium (n = 1.4) (22Lakowicz J.R. Principle of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983: 111-339Google Scholar). The overlap integral, J, characterizes the resonance between the donor and acceptor dipoles. The fluorescence transfer efficiency of chemically identical donor and acceptor pairs, characterized by the same quantum yields, depends on the distance between the donor and acceptor, R, and the factor, κ2, describing the mutual orientation of the donor and acceptor dipoles (22Lakowicz J.R. Principle of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983: 111-339Google Scholar). Although in the work presented in this paper we are interested in relative distances between donors and acceptors, evaluation of κ2 allowed us to estimate the effect of the orientation factor on the differences between the studied donor-acceptor distances. The factor κ2 cannot be experimentally determined; however, the upper (κ2max) and lower (κ2min) limits of κ2 can be obtained from the measured limiting anisotropies of the donor and acceptor and the calculated axial depolarization factors, using the procedure described by Dale et al. (24Dale R.E. Esinger J. Blumberg W.E. Biophys. J. 1979; 26: 161-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). When both axial depolarization factors are positive, κ2maxand κ2min can be calculated from κ2max = ( 23)(1 + <dXD> + <dXA> + 3<dXD><dXA>) and κ2min = ( 23)(1 − (½)(<dXD> + <dXA>), where <dXD> and <dXA> are the axial depolarization factors for the donor and acceptor, respectively (24Dale R.E. Esinger J. Blumberg W.E. Biophys. J. 1979; 26: 161-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The axial depolarization factors have been calculated as square roots of the ratios of the limiting anisotropies of the donors (CPM on the DnaB helicase) and acceptors (fluorescein at the 5′- or 3′-end of the ssDNA oligomers) and their corresponding fundamental anisotropies (17Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31359-31371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For two chemically identical donor-acceptor pairs, characterized by the sameRo (the same κ2, φd, and J), the differences in the transfer efficiencies,E1 and E2, result exclusively from the different distances between the donor and acceptor, R1 and R2. The relative ratio of the two distances is then defined by using Equation10 as follows. R1R2=[(1−E1)E2][(1−E2)E1]1/6Equation 11 In this work, we followed the binding of the DnaB protein to the ssDNA oligomers by monitoring the fluorescence increase, ΔF, of ssDNA etheno-derivatives upon the complex formation. Proteins and nucleic acids may form complexes characterized by different spectroscopic properties, particularly when multiple ligand binding processes are studied. In applying spectroscopic methods to monitor the ligand macromolecule interactions, one should not assume strict proportionality between the observed signal change and the degree of binding unless the existence of such proportionality has been shown (15Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5888-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The general method to obtain thermodynamically rigorous estimates of the average degree of binding of the protein per ssDNA oligomer, Σνi, and the free protein concentration,PF, has been previously described by us (8Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4261-4265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5888-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 25Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2117-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, the experimentally observed ΔF has a contribution from each of the different possible “i” complexes of the DnaB hexamer with a nucleic acid. Thus, the observed fluorescence increase is functionally related to Σνi by the equation, ΔF=∑νiΔFimaxEquation 12 where ΔFimax is the molecular parameter characterizing the maximum fluorescence increase of the nucleic acid with the DnaB protein bound in complexi. The same value of ΔF, obtained at two different total nucleic acid concentrations, NT1 and NT2, indicates the same physical state of the nucleic acid, i.e. the degree of binding, Σνi, and the free DnaB protein concentration,PF, must be the same. The value of Σνi and PF is then related to the total protein concentrations, PT1 and PT2, and the total nucleic acid concentrations, NT1 and NT2, at the same value of ΔF, by the following equations, ∑νi=(PT2−PT1)(NT2−NT1)Equation 13 PF=PTx−(∑νi)NTxEquation 14 where x = 1 or 2 (12Bujalowski W. Jezewska M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 20Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 64: 253-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Quantitative fluorescence titrations and photo-cross-linking experiments, using ssDNA oligomers, showed that the DnaB hexamer has a single ssDNA binding site encompassing 20 ± 3 nucleotide residues and located predominantly on a single subunit (12Bujalowski W. Jezewska M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 13Jezewska M.J. Kim U-S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2129-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Jezewska M.J. Kim U-S. Bujalowski W. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2075-2086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The first evidence of the structural heterogeneity within the DNA binding site came from nuclease digestion-protection studies of the DNA in the complex with the helicase. In the first set of experiments, the complex of the DnaB hexamer with the 20-mer dT(pT)19labeled at its 5′-end with 32P in the presence of 1 mm AMP-PNP was subjected to micrococcal nuclease digestion as a function of time. The protein was in molar excess over the 20-mer to ensure complete saturation of the nucleic acid. Fig. 1 a shows the polyacrylamide sequencing gel of dT(pT)19 after digestion with the nuclease, at different time intervals, in the absence and presence of the helicase. In the absence of the helicase, in our solution conditions, the 20-mer was digested within 20 min. A dramatically different behavior was observed in the presence of the enzyme. The digestion process was less efficient, indicating significant protection of the nucleic acid against the nuclease by the enzyme. Moreover, at prolonged digestion times, a nucleic acid fragment of 10 or 11 nucleotide residues was strongly protected by the helicase. At the longest times, this was the major nucleic acid fragment on the gel, resistant to further nuclease action (Fig. 1 a). The size of the protected fragment was not dependent upon the length or type of base of the oligomer bound to the DnaB protein, indicating that protection against the nuclease digestion is limited to the nucleic acid bound within the single DNA binding site of the helicase. Fig. 1 b shows polyacrylamide sequencing gels of dA(pA)69 after digestion with the nuclease, at different time intervals, and in the absence and presence of the helicase. As in the case of dT(pT)19, the only predominant oligomer protected by the helicase in the complex with dA(pA)69, after prolonged digestion, is a ssDNA fragment, 10 or 11 nucleotide residues long. These data indicate that, within the total DNA binding site of the DnaB helicase, approximately half of the ∼20 nucleotide residues occluded by the helicase are bound differently than the remaining half, resulting in the observed nuclease digestion pattern. Thus, these results indicate that the total DNA binding site of the DnaB helicase is built of two structurally and possibly functionally different binding subsites (see below). To determine whether or not there is a difference in affinities between t"
https://openalex.org/W2124419019,"The uncharged photoactivable probe 2-[3H]diazofluorene ([3H]DAF) was used to examine structural changes in the Torpedo californica nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) ion channel induced by agonists. Photoincorporation of [3H]DAF into the AChR consisted of the following two components: a nonspecific component consistent with incorporation into residues situated at the lipid-protein interface, and a specific component, inhibitable by noncompetitive antagonists and localized to the M2 hydrophobic segments of AChR subunits. The nonspecific [3H]DAF incorporation was characterized in the M4 segment of each AChR subunit. The observed distribution and periodicity of labeled residues reinforce the conclusion that the M4 segments are organized as transmembrane α-helices with a common “face” of each helix in contact with lipid. Within the M2 segments, in the absence of agonist [3H]DAF specifically labeled homologous residues βVal-261 and δVal-269, with incorporation into δVal-269 at a 5-fold greater efficiency than into βVal-261. This observation, coupled with the lack of detectable incorporation into α-M2 including the homologous αVal-255, indicates that within the resting channel [3H]DAF is bound with its photoreactive diazo group oriented toward δVal-269. In the presence of agonist, there is an ∼90% reduction in the labeling of βVal-261 and δVal-269 accompanied by specific incorporation into residues (βLeu-257, βAla-258, δSer-262, and δLeu-265) situated 1 or 2 turns of an α-helix closer to the cytoplasmic end of the M2 segments. The results provide a further characterization of agonist-induced rearrangements of the M2 (ion channel) domain of the AChR."
https://openalex.org/W2041542168,"The periplasmic fates of misfolded MalE31, a defective folding mutant of the maltose-binding protein, were determined by manipulating two cellular activities affecting the protein folding pathway in host cells: (i) the malEppromoter activity, which is controlled by the transcriptional activator MalT, and (ii) the DegP and Protease III periplasmic proteolytic activity. At a low level of expression, the degradation of misfolded MalE31 was partially impaired in cells lacking DegP or Protease III. At a high level of expression, misfolded MalE31 rapidly formed periplasmic inclusion bodies and thus escaped degradation. However, the manipulated host cell activities did not enhance the production of periplasmic, soluble MalE31. A kinetic competition between folding, aggregation, and degradation is proposed as a general model for the biogenesis of periplasmic proteins.

A kinetic competition between folding, aggregation, and degradation is proposed as a general model for the biogenesis of periplasmic proteins. Among the functions of protein degradation in living cells is the elimination of misfolded proteins with abnormal conformations (1Gottesman S. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Because misfolded proteins can induce cellular stress (2Goff S.A. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1985; 41: 587-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), proteolysis is a major component of the highly conserved regulatory heat shock response. Recently, a new heat shock sigma factor, ςE (or ς24), involved in extra-cytoplasmic stresses has been discovered in Escherichia coli (4Strauch K.L. Johnson K. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In the periplasmic compartment, among many proteases, the DegP (also known as HtrA or Do) protease is the only protease, identified as a heat shock protein, involved in the degradation of misfolded proteins (3Strauch K. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1576-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 4Strauch K.L. Johnson K. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). ThedegP gene, which is under the transcriptional regulation of sigma ςE, is essential for the survival of E. coli above 42 °C (5Lipinska B. Fayet O. Baird L. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1574-1584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our aim is to understand the exact relationships between export and folding of bacterial periplasmic proteins. We are using a model system based on the maltose-binding protein (MalE or MBP) of E. coli. The MalE protein serves as the periplasmic receptor for the high affinity transport of maltose and maltodextrins (6Nikaido H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because of its key role in maltose transport, correct export and folding of MalE into the periplasm is essential for cells to utilize maltose as a carbon source. This feature facilitated the use of genetic selections for analyzing MalE export (7Schatz P.J. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 215-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and folding (8Betton J.-M. Boscus D. Missiakas D. Raina S. Hofnung M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 140-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). MalE is synthesized in the cytoplasm as a precursor protein, preMalE, with an amino-terminal signal sequence. This signal sequence serves to target the precursor protein to the periplasm. As the precursor enters the periplasm, the signal sequence is cleaved off by the signal peptidase. Upon removal of the signal peptide, the protein is released from the membrane into the periplasm and refolds to its native structure. The three-dimensional structure of MalE consists of two discontinuous domains constructed from secondary structural βαβ units surrounding a cleft that forms the binding site for maltose and maltodextrins (9Spurlino J.C. Lu G.Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Spurlino J.C. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10657-10663Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). We previously identified amino acid substitutions of MalE that are critical for the in vivo folding (11Betton J.-M. Hofnung M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8046-8052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Among these mutations, the most defective variant, MalE31, corresponds to the double substitution of G32D and I33P in the αβ loop connecting the helix I to strand B of the N-domain. In vivo, the MalE31 precursor was correctly exported, based on the kinetics of signal peptide processing, but the defective folding of the mature protein in the periplasm led to the formation of inclusion bodies (11Betton J.-M. Hofnung M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8046-8052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the modified loop, which is apart from the maltose-binding site, did not perturb the maltose-binding affinity of the purified protein, renatured from inclusion bodies. One major physiological consequence for the cells overproducing MalE31 was an increase in ςEactivity, and, hence, DegP synthesis (12Missiakas D. Betton J.-M. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, this increased level of DegP did not degrade a series of misfolded MalE31 variants (8Betton J.-M. Boscus D. Missiakas D. Raina S. Hofnung M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 140-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the production of MalE31 in several protease-deficient strains to clarify these contradictory observations and to specify precisely the different kinetic parameters between folding, aggregation, and degradation of proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. The bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table I. The degP and ptr mutants were constructed by standard P1 transduction (13Miller J.H. Manual L. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics.

The recA1 allele was introduced by cotransduction with srl::Tn10. All strains carried a non-polar deletion of the chromosomal malEgene (14Shuman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5455-5461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and pop6499 gave constitutive, high level expression of the maltose operons because it contained the malTcallele (16Debarbouille M. Shuman H.A. Silhavy T.J. Schwartz M. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 124: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Plasmids pHCME31 and pHCME-I33P are pBR322 derivatives that carry the malE alleles under the control of their own promoters; the MalT-dependent malEp promoter (11Betton J.-M. Hofnung M. J. Biol.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml carbenicillin and 0.2% maltose, at 30 °C for 3 h (A600 ≈ 1). Cells from 10 ml of the culture (5 × 108 cells/ml) were harvested by centrifugation and fractionated by spheroplast preparation as described previously (8Betton J.-M. Boscus D. Missiakas D. Raina S. Hofnung M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 140-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The periplasmic and membrane fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12.5% acrylamide). Proteins were visualized by either Coomassie Blue or silver staining and scanned with a MasterScan I Interpretive densitometer (Scanalytics). Relative steady-state levels of insoluble MalE31 were normalized to the level of the outer membrane protein, OmpA, and the amount of MalE31 in the pop6499 cells was taken as 100%. Cells (pop6499 and pop6590 strains) harboring pHCME31 were grown at 30 °C in M63B1 medium (13Miller J.H. Manual L. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% glycerol, 0.4% maltose, 0.1 mg/ml carbenicillin, and each of the 20 amino acids (40 μg/ml) except methionine and cysteine. Cells were labeled with 60 μCi of [35S]methionine/ml for 2 min and then chased with an excess of unlabeled methionine (2 mg/ml). At various times, 0.1-ml fractions were removed and immediately lysed by boiling with 0.1 ml of 4% SDS gel-loading buffer for 3 min. Lysates were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (14% acrylamide). Cells (pop6499 and pop6590 strains) harboring pOM82 or pMDX were grown in M63B1 medium supplemented with 0.4% glycerol, 0.1% casamino acids, and 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin at 30 °C. At an A600 of 0.1, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.1 mm) or maltose (final concentration, 0.2%) was added to the cultures. After 2 h of induction, cells were harvested. and β-galactosidase activity was determined as described in Miller (13Miller J.H. Manual L. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Strain pop6499, producing either wild-type or variant (MalE31 or MalE-I33P) MalE, was grown at 30 °C in LB medium supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml carbenicillin. The wild-type MalE was released by osmotic shock procedure (20Duplay P. Szmelcman S. Bedouelle H. Hofnung M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The MalE31 and MalE-I33P proteins were purified from inclusion bodies after a urea solubilization step as described previously (11Betton J.-M. Hofnung M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8046-8052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). All three proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on a cross-linked amylose column (21Ferenci T. Klotz U. FEBS Lett. 1978; 94: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm with an extinction coefficient of ε = 68,750m−1·cm−1 (11Betton J.-M. Hofnung M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8046-8052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Refolding kinetics were performed by a 101-fold dilution of unfolded MalE variants (10 μm in 4.2 mGdnHCl) 2The abbreviation used is: GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride. into a final concentration of 0.04 m GdnHCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 25 °C. The fluorescence emission intensities were recorded at 345 nm (excitation wavelength, 290 nm) using a Fluoromax spectrofluorometer (Spex). Data were fitted using the non-linear regression analysis program Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, PCS Inc.). To determine the exact susceptibility of misfolded MalE31 to periplasmic degradation, we constructed three isogenic protease-deficient strains lacking either the DegP protease (NS2) or the Protease III (NS6) or both (NS5; TableI). Protease III (also known as Pi), the ptr gene product, is another periplasmic protease involved in the degradation of exported protein fusions (15Baneyx F. Georgiou G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2696-2703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The steady-state level of MalE31 in these different protease-deficient strains is shown in parallel with the strain carrying the malTc allele (Fig. 1 A). The presence of themalTc allele in the pop6499 strain ensured that the malE31 gene encoded by pHCME31 is expressed at a high and constitutive level, even in absence of maltose. Because no cytoplasmic accumulation and complete processing of the MalE31 precursor were previously reported in this genetic background (11Betton J.-M. Hofnung M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8046-8052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the preprotein translocase did not limit the periplasmic level of MalE31 under these conditions of high expression. Thus, intracellular distribution between soluble and insoluble fraction is given by cellular fractionation into periplasmic and membrane fractions, respectively. The MalE31 protein was found predominantly in the membrane fraction (Fig. 1 A). The level of periplasmic MalE31 was very low, and the protein could be only detected after silver staining the gel. However, although the deficiency of protease and the promoter strength had no effect on the soluble protein, it had pronounced effects on the level of aggregated MalE31. From the membrane fractions, production of aggregated MalE31 ranged from a high level (in strain pop6499) to undetectable (in strain pop6590). Previous mutagenesis studies indicated that the extent of periplasmic inclusion body formation varied with the nature of amino acid residues at positions 32 and 33 of MalE (8Betton J.-M. Boscus D. Missiakas D. Raina S. Hofnung M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 140-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The MalE-I33P variant that displayed less severe folding defects than MalE31 had a soluble/insoluble distribution of 40/60 (11Betton J.-M. Hofnung M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8046-8052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). At the steady-state, the periplasmic levels of MalE-I33P were very similar whatever the producing strain (Fig. 1 B). Once again, differences were observed only for the aggregated protein sedimenting with membrane fractions (Fig. 2). Although the basal level in pop6590 is higher than for MalE31, insoluble production of MalE-I33P was similarly enhanced in the protease-deficient strains. Increased production in the three protease-deficient strains (NS2, NS5, and NS6) relative to the isogenic pop6590 strain suggests decreased degradation of misfolded MalE31 and MalE-I33P. Although the effects of the degP and ptr mutations were approximately cumulative, DegP deficiency was more effective on the degradation of both misfolded proteins (Fig. 2). However, the greatest amount of insoluble MalE31 was found in the malTc strain (pop6499), even though this strain is degP+,ptr+. The production level of MalE31 in the pop6590 strain, assessed from both the periplasmic and membrane fractions shown in Fig. 1 B, was very low compared with the pop6499 strain. We performed two sets of experiments to test whether the expression of themalE31 gene was poorly induced and/or whether the corresponding protein was correctly synthesized and exported but rapidly degraded. First, the high level expression of malE31 obtained in the pop6499 strain could stem primarily from the activation of the MalT-dependent promoter. Thus, we quantified themalEp promoter activity in the malT+(pop6590) and malTc (pop6499) genetic backgrounds using two different transcriptional gene fusions:malEp-lacZ encoded by pOM82 and tac-lacZ encoded by pMDX (Fig. 3 A). The synthesis of β-galactosidase directed from the malEp promoter was 5-fold higher in pop6499 than in pop6590. However, in both strains, transformed by pMDX, the same level of β-galactosidase activity was measured. This result suggested that translational levels in both strains are similar when a gene is transcribed from a MalT-independent promoter. Further comparisons of these strains were investigated with pT31H, a plasmid expressing malE31 under the control of thetac promoter. The membrane fractions, prepared as described above, showed a similar level of aggregated MalE31 in both strains (Fig. 3 B) and confirmed the transcriptional fusion data obtained with pMDX. Second, pulse-chase experiments were performed to measure the intracellular stability of MalE31 in both strains (Fig. 4). MalE31 appeared to be rapidly degraded in the malT+ strain; in fact no protein was observed after a 1-min chase (half-life < 30 s). In contrast, the protein showed no degradation in pop6499 after 1 h. From Fig. 4, it is evident that MalE31 is considerably more stable in the malTc strain; this stability can be attributed to the insoluble misfolded protein. Conversely, intracellular degradation appeared to be a major cause of the low level production of MalE31 observed in pop6590 cells. Previous transcriptional studies on ςE activity performed with a fusion of the degP promoter to the lacZgene has demonstrated that degP transcription is increased in cells overproducing MalE31 (12Missiakas D. Betton J.-M. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, this increased cellular level of DegP did not degrade the misfolded MalE31, overproduced in the pop6499 strain (8Betton J.-M. Boscus D. Missiakas D. Raina S. Hofnung M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 140-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To test, more directly, the steady-state level of DegP production on MalE31 overproduction in pop6499 and pop6590 cell extracts, we performed an immunoblot analysis with anti-DegP antibodies. Data on Fig. 5 Aconfirmed those obtained previously with thedegP-lacZ fusion: the cellular level of DegP increased with the level of insoluble MalE31. However, when cellular fractionation was carried out, the periplasmic amount of DegP did not reflect its level in whole cell extracts. Indeed, DegP was found mainly associated with membrane fractions, and the level of DegP in these insoluble fractions increased with the extend of MalE31 aggregation (Fig. 5 B). This result suggests that export of DegP could be blocked in the membrane (if the export pathway is overloaded or partially jammed by the MalE31 precursor) or, alternatively, that DegP coaggregated with misfolded MalE31 in the periplasm. To determine whether the anomalous cellular localization of DegP provoked by the overproduction of MalE31 could be related to an inhibition of the export pathway, the signal sequence processing of DegP precursor was examined by pulse-chase experiments. There was no significant difference in DegP precursor processing observed in pop6499 cells carrying pHCME31 or pΔ709 (data not shown). Therefore, under overproduction of MalE31, DegP coaggregated with misfolded MalE31 in inclusion bodies. Several studies carried out on various proteins produced in the cytoplasm of E. coli supported a correlation of thermodynamic stability with the extent of inclusion body formation (22Parsell D.A. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7590-7595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Inoue I. Rechsteiner I. J. Biol.

Folding Design. 1996; 1: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The results described here suggest that instead of thermodynamic stability, dynamic folding properties of the newly translocated protein would better reflect the final distribution among alternative pathways. We therefore determined whether the amino acid substitutions at positions 32 and 33 had altered the folding rate of MalE. The refolding process of the wild-type and variant proteins after denaturation in 4 m GdnHCl, as monitored by the fluorescence of tryptophan residues, appeared to be at least biphasic (Fig. 6). The first phase was too fast to be analyzed by manual mixing (dead time of 10 s). However, this phase was detected because its amplitude accounted for 40% of the total signal recorded between native and denatured proteins. The remainder of the change in fluorescence accompanying refolding (60%) was attributed to a slow phase with a rate constant that varies between the different MalE variants (Table II). The final renaturation yields of the MalE variants, reported in TableII, reflected well their intrinsic tendency to misfold. The MalE-I33P protein purified from the soluble periplasmic fraction (by osmotic shock) displayed similar refolding kinetic parameters to those of the protein purified from inclusion bodies (data not shown). It is interesting to note the correlation between the refolding rate and the extent of corresponding soluble MalE protein in the periplasmic fractions (Table II).Table IIIn vitro refolding of MalE variantsProteinPeriplasmic yield2-2001Amount of MalE in soluble periplasmic fraction normalized to cellular protein content taken from Ref. 11.Refolding rate2-bFirst order rate constant and normalized amplitude of the slow refolding phase followed by fluorescence at 25 °C.Refolding yield2-bFirst order rate constant and normalized amplitude of the slow refolding phase followed by fluorescence at 25 °C.μg/mgmin−1%MalE-wt23 ± 46.2 ± 0.385 ± 2MalE-I33P6 ± 10.47 ± 0.0175 ± 1MalE310.2 ± 0.10.25 ± 0.0160 ± 12-2001 Amount of MalE in soluble periplasmic fraction normalized to cellular protein content taken from Ref. 11Betton J.-M.

Open table in a new tab This work was initiated to delineate the determinants of the fate of misfolded proteins, dictated by the interplay between host cell characteristics and protein folding parameters. By modulating cellular factors involved in the folding pathway of misfolded variants of MalE, we showed that: (i) at low level promoter activity, the protein was rapidly degraded by at least two known periplasmic proteases, DegP and Protease III; (ii) at high level promoter activity, the protein aggregated and formed inclusion bodies; and (iii) the level of soluble protein depended neither on promoter activity nor on proteolytic activity but could be determined by the ratio of rate constants governing the competition between misfolding and folding. In regards to periplasmic degradation, the high production level of MalE31 in pop6499 had two important consequences. First, increased amounts of aggregating species increases the formation of inclusion bodies, the compact nature of which renders them resistant to proteases. Such a protective effect is well documented in the literature (25Enfors S.O. Trends Biotech. 1992; 10: 310-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Second, although overproduction of misfolded MalE31 increased the rate of DegP synthesis via the ςE response, the majority of that increased amount of protease was localized in the insoluble fraction. Because DegP is intimately involved in the degradation of misfolded proteins in the periplasm (3Strauch K. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1576-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that DegP co-aggregated with misfolded MalE31 during the formation of inclusion bodies. A working model for the periplasmic fates of the newly translocated protein is presented in Fig. 7 and used for simulations. Although some aspects are hypothetical, the main features of the model are as follows: (i) The single folding step involved in the formation of the native structure is competing with the initial misfolding step leading to aggregation or degradation. (ii) The misfolding species would originate from the formation of a wrong chain conformation (as an incorrect isomeric state of a peptidyl-prolyl peptide, see below). This isomerization step is followed either by further association steps involved in the formation of inclusion bodies (high order reaction) or by a degradation step of this partially structured and misfolded intermediate. (iii) Although the misfolded protein is assumed to be the only conformation of the protein that is a substrate for proteolytic degradation, correct simulations were obtained with the newly translocated protein as alternative protease substrate. When kmis exceeds kfold(Fig. 7 A), either the degradation flux (at lowkexport) or the aggregation flux (at highkexport) is larger than the flux in the folding pathway. On the contrary, when kfold is larger than kmis (Fig. 7 B), the flux through the folding pathway always exceeds the rate of formation of misfolded proteins. Hence, the aggregation and degradation fluxes are both lower than the folding flux, whatever the rate of protein translocation. The relative predominance of the degradation flux over the aggregation flux depends on all the rate constant values. The degradation flux predominates at low kexport values. However, when the translocation rate increases, aggregation flux becomes more and more preferential. This model is very similar to the general model presented by Kiefhaberet al. (26Kiefhaber T. Rudolph R. Kohler H.-H. Buchner J. BioTechnology. 1991; 9: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) for the kinetic competition between folding and aggregation, except for the export and degradation steps. Indeed, this outcome was incorporated into the model to support the results described here. Because kinetics of signal sequence processing of both MalE31 (11Betton J.-M. Hofnung M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8046-8052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and DegP precursors (data not shown) were unaffected by overproduction of misfolded MalE31, export to the periplasm does not constitute a critical step for the periplasmic folding pathway of bacterial proteins. The extent of aggregation is determined by both the rate of gene expression, which is related for MalE to the rate of export, and protein folding or misfolding rates. At high rates of expression, second order aggregation dominates over first order folding. Yet aggregation depends obviously on the existence of cellular proteases. At the misfolding stage a second kinetic competition between degradation and aggregation might occur, and a further increase in the rate of expression (as in the malTc background) will favor the aggregation reaction. Obviously, in pop6499 cells the degradation rate of misfolded MalE was found to be much slower than the formation of aggregated species (Fig. 1). Under these conditions, the misfolded protein escapes periplasmic degradation and accumulates as inclusion bodies. An alternative possibility to balance the relative rates of degradation versus aggregation may involve the specificity of periplasmic proteases. Our results also suggest that the modified loop of MalE, which probably decreased the flexibility of the corresponding supersecondary structure, might promote non-native interactions of folding intermediates. Little is known about the molecular mechanism and specific groups involved in the aggregation reaction. Nevertheless, it is clear that even small changes in primary structure can drastically affect solubility, presumably by altering folding pathways (27Mitraki A. King J. BioTechnology. 1989; 7: 690-697Crossref Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The proline substitution in MalE31 could explain the misfolding properties of this mutant. Indeed, the major folding effect of proline substitution is the slow cis-trans isomerization of peptidyl-proline bonds that can be a rate-determining step (28Brandts J.F. Halvorson H.R. Brennan M. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4953-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Because MalE31 refolds more slowly than MalE-wt (Fig. 6), this slowest refolding step could be explained by a slow isomerization step in the unfolded state. However, by performing double jump experiments (28Brandts J.F. Halvorson H.R. Brennan M. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4953-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar), we never detected a slow equilibrium between two unfolded states (11Betton J.-M. Hofnung M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8046-8052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Yet, we cannot rule out a fast isomerization step forming early misfolded species along the misfolding pathway. From the simulations presented in Fig. 7, we might expect that the misfolding step is faster than the slowest refolding step of MalE31. Alternatively, the aggregation of MalE31 could be interpreted as the consequence of the wrong intermolecular pairing of partially folded domains (29Jaenicke R. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1995; 348: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Previous mutational analysis of amino acid substitutions at positions 32 and 33 (defining an α/β loop in the structure of the N-domain of MalE) has identified several defective folding variants with non-Pro substitution (8Betton J.-M. Boscus D. Missiakas D. Raina S. Hofnung M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 140-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). According to this explanation, mutational effects on the formation of inclusion bodies might be mediated by changes in the kinetic folding properties of the N-domain of MalE. The heat shock response in E. coli is compartmentalized into cytoplasmic and extracytoplasmic responses that are controlled by two different sigma factors, ς32 and ςE, respectively (30Mecsas J. Rouvière P.E. Erickson J.W. Donohue T.J. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2618-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 31Missiakas D. Raina S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 59-63Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Misfolded proteins in the periplasm seem to be targeted only for proteolysis by triggering the ςE degP regulon (30Mecsas J. Rouvière P.E. Erickson J.W. Donohue T.J. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2618-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 32Raina S. Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1043-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). However, a newly translocated protein may encounter two types of rate-limiting folding steps that will be overcome by two classes of folding catalysts: protein disulfide isomerase and peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerases. Both classes of folding catalysts have been identified in the periplasm ofE. coli. The lack of Cys residues in MalE eliminates the implication of Dsb proteins, the bacterial periplasmic protein disulfide isomerases (31Missiakas D. Raina S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 59-63Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recently, by using the cellular effect of misfolded MalE31 on the ςE response, Missiakas et al. (12Missiakas D. Betton J.-M. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) cloned two genes, surA and fkpA, coding for two different families of peptidyl prolylcis-trans isomerases. We may speculate that these catalysts act by accelerating a rate-limiting folding step on the productive pathway shown in Fig. 7. This possibility, which was not directly addressed in the present studies, is currently under investigation.

https://openalex.org/W1974395074,"Mapping of tryptic phosphopeptides of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) from non-stressed or moderately heat-stressed HeLa cells, labeled in vivo by [32P]orthophosphate, revealed four major phosphopeptides A to D. Heat stress drastically increased phosphopeptide signals. To identify target peptides and amino acids and to correlate phosphorylation and transactivation function, phosphopeptide maps were produced of LexA-human HSF1 chimeras and mutant derivatives thereof, and transactivation activities of original and mutant chimeras were compared. LexA-HSF1 chimeras were previously shown to be regulated identically to HSF1, except that they transactivate promoters with LexA-binding sites instead of hsp promoters. The patterns of phosphopeptides of LexA-HSF1 and endogenous HSF1 were similar. Analysis of single residue substitutions suggested that phosphopeptide C is peptide VKEEPPSPPQSPR (297–309) phosphorylated on Ser-307 but not Ser-303. Substitution of Ser-307 but not Ser-303 caused deregulation of factor activity. Mapping of several constitutively active chimeras associated unphosphorylated peptide C with the transcriptionally active HSF1 conformation, suggesting that dephosphorylation of this peptide (at Ser-307) may either be an integral step in the activation process or serve to maintain the active conformation of HSF1. Exploiting this correlation, indirect evidence was obtained that activation domains of HSF1 interact with the distantly located regulatory domain to maintain the factor in an inactive state."

We recently reported that scavenger receptors expressed by liver endothelial cells (LECs) dominantly mediate the endocytic uptake of AGE proteins from plasma, suggesting its potential role as an eliminating system for AGE proteins in vivo (Smedsrød, B., Melkko, J., Araki, N., Sano, H., and Horiuchi, S. (1997) Biochem. J. 322, 567–573). In the present study we examined the effects of insulin on macrophage scavenger receptor (MSR)-mediated endocytic uptake of AGE proteins. LECs expressing MSR showed an insulin-sensitive increase of endocytic uptake of AGE-bovine serum albumin (AGE-BSA). Next, RAW 264.7 cells expressing a high amount of MSR were overexpressed with human insulin receptor (HIR). Insulin caused a 3.7-fold increase in endocytic uptake of 125I-AGE-BSA by these cells. The effect of insulin was inhibited by wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3 kinase) inhibitor. To examine at a molecular level the relationship between insulin signal and MSR function, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing a negligible level of MSR were cotransfected with both MSR and HIR. Insulin caused a 1.7-fold increase in the endocytic degradation of 125I-AGE-BSA by these cells, the effect of which was also inhibited by wortmannin and LY294002, another PI3 kinase inhibitor. Transfection of CHO cells overexpressing MSR with two HIR mutants, a kinase-deficient mutant, and another lacking the binding site for insulin receptor substrates (IRS) resulted in disappearance of the stimulatory effect of insulin on endocytic uptake of AGE proteins. The present results indicate that insulin may accelerate MSR-mediated endocytic uptake of AGE proteins through an IRS/PI3 kinase pathway.

Prolonged incubation of proteins with glucose leads, through the formation of early stage products, such as Schiff base and Amadori rearrangement products, to the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE), 1The abbreviations used are: AGE, advanced glycation end product(s); LEC(s), liver endothelial cell(s); MSR, macrophage scavenger receptor; HIR, human insulin receptor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; BSA, bovine serum albumin; LDL, low density lipoproteins; acetyl, acetylated; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PI3, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH. compounds that have unique properties, such as fluorescence, browning, and cross-linking. Accumulation of AGE proteins has been identified in several tissues in association with aging and age-enhanced disease states, including diabetic complications (1Makino H. Shikata K. Hironaka K.

AGE-modified proteins are known to induce several cellular responses, such as mitogenic activity for macrophages (8Yui S. Sasaki T. Araki N. Horiuchi S. Yamazaki M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1943-1949PubMed Google Scholar), and a chemotactic activity for vascular smooth muscle cells (9Higashi T. Sano H. Saishoji T. Ikeda K. Jinnouchi Y. Kanzaki T. Morisaki N. Rauvala H. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 463-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence and/or accumulation of AGE proteins in arterial walls (4Kume S. Takeya M.

Dohi K. Makita Z. Vlassara H. Bucala R. Am. J.

However, under physiological conditions, most AGE-modified proteins in plasma should undergo rapid plasma clearance. Thus, following intravenous injection in normal rats, AGE proteins are rapidly cleared from the circulation (12Takata K. Horiuchi S. Araki N. Shiga M. Saitoh M. Morino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14819-14825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such clearance is largely achieved by active endocytic uptake by hepatic sinusoidal cells such as endothelial and Kupffer cells (12Takata K. Horiuchi S. Araki N. Shiga M. Saitoh M. Morino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14819-14825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13Smedsrød B. Melkko J. Araki N. Sano H. Horiuchi S. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It might be hypothesized therefore that the formation of AGE proteins beyond physiological levels or impairment of the AGE elimination system, potentially result in accumulation of AGE in tissues. Insulin therapy reduces high plasma levels of early stage products, such as hemoglobin A1c and glycated albumin, as well as those of AGE proteins (14Makita Z. Vlassara H. Rayfield E. Cartwright K. Friedman E. Rodby R. Cerami A. Bucala R. Science. 1992; 258: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Normalization of glycated proteins levels may thus delay the onset and slow the progression of diabetic complications (15The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group (DCCT) N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 976-986Google Scholar). Insulin treatment may protect the tissues from AGE accumulation indirectly by reducing AGE formation due largely to normalization of plasma glucose levels. However, since AGE proteins are recognized as ligands by AGE receptors in vivo, it is also possible that insulin plays a more direct role in AGE elimination from plasma or tissues by regulating the AGE receptor system. Three types of AGE receptors have been identified so far, including MSR (16Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J. Matsudaira P. Krieger M.

Our recent study using peritoneal macrophages from MSR knockout mice has indicated that the endocytic capacity for AGE-BSA by these cells was reduced to approximately 20–30% of those of wild litter mate mice (20Suzuki H.

Our recent study also showed that liver endothelial cells (LECs), which expressed a large amounts of MSR (20Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada N. Kataoka M. Jishage K. Ueda O. Sakaguchi H.

Nature. 1997; 386: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar), were responsible for elimination of 60–65% of intravenously injected AGE proteins from plasma and that the endocytic uptake of AGE proteins by cultured LECs was significantly inhibited by the ligands for MSR, suggesting a major contribution of MSR to endocytosis of AGE proteins by LECs (13Smedsrød B. Melkko J. Araki N. Sano H. Horiuchi S. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the present study, we focused on MSR as an elimination system for AGE proteins and investigated the effect of insulin on endocytic uptake of AGE proteins by MSR. F-12 medium, RPMI 1640 medium, penicillin G, streptomycin, and G418 were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., hygromycin B and wortmannin from Wako (Osaka, Japan), LY294002 and rapamycin from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and human recombinant insulin from Sigma. Na125I and 125I-human insulin was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Other chemicals were of the best grade available from commercial sources. Culture dishes coated with type IV collagen (35 mm in diameter) were purchased from Becton Dickinson (Bedford, MA). Bovine type II MSR expression vector pXSRII was a kind gift from Dr. Tatsuhiko Kodama (Department of Molecular Biology and Medicine, Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Tokyo). AGE-BSA was prepared as described previously (12Takata K. Horiuchi S. Araki N. Shiga M. Saitoh M. Morino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14819-14825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except for incubation for 40 weeks. Human LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml) was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation of human plasma from normal lipidemic subjects after overnight fasting and dialyzed against 0.15 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA (22Miyazaki A. Sakai M. Suginohara Y. Hakamata H. Sakamoto Y. Morikawa W. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acetylated LDL (acetyl-LDL) was prepared by chemical modification of LDL with acetic anhydride as described previously (23Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Hakamata H. Sasaki T. Yui S. Yamazaki M. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31430-31435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AGE-BSA was labeled with 125I by IODO-GEN (Bio-Rad) (12Takata K. Horiuchi S. Araki N. Shiga M. Saitoh M. Morino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14819-14825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and acetyl-LDL was labeled as described by McFarlane (24McFarlane A.S. Nature. 1958; 182: 53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar) to a specific radioactivity of 850 and 420 cpm/ng, respectively. The preparation of pure cultures of functionally intact LECs from a single rat liver has been detailed in the previous paper (25Pertoft H. Smedsrød B. Pretlow T.G., II Pretlow T.P. Cell Separation, Methods, and Selected Applications. 4. Academic Press, New York1987: 1-24Google Scholar). After collagenase perfusion of the liver, and isopycnic centrifugation of the resulting dispersed cells through Percoll (Pharmacia), pure monolayer cultures of LECs were established by selective attachment to substrates of type IV collagen. Human insulin receptor (HIR) cDNA nucleotides and amino acids were numbered according to the system of Ebina et al. (26Ebina Y. Ellis L. Jarnagin K. Edery M. Graf L. Clauser E. Ou J.H. Masiartz F. Kan Y.W. Goldfine I.D. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1985; 40: 747-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with the wild-type HIR expression vector (SRαIR) and pSV2neo by the lipofection method according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer (Lipofectin, Life Technologies, Inc.). Clones resistant to 0.4 mg/ml G418 were assayed for the expression of HIR by using 125I-insulin binding assay as described previously (27Hayashi H. Miyake N. Kanai F. Shibasaki F. Takenawa T. Ebina Y. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). One of five positive clones selected was used for the experiment as HIR-transfected RAW (RAW-HIR) cells. To coexpress HIR and MSR in CHO cells, we used MSR-transfected CHO cells (CHO-MSR cells) as a starting cell, as described in our previous study (17Araki N. Higashi T. Mori T. Shibayama R. Kawabe Y. Kodama T. Takahashi K. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). CHO-MSR cells were isolated according to the original method of Freeman et al. (28Freeman M. Ekkel Y. Rohrer L. Penman M. Freeman N. Chisolm G.M. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4931-4935Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, bovine type II MSR expression vector, pXSRII, was transfected to CHO cells using polybrene method. To select an MSR-positive clone, cells were cultured in F-12 medium containing 5% fetal calf lipoprotein-deficient serum, 250 μm mevalonic acid, 3 μg/ml acetyl-LDL, and 40 μm compactin. We selected one of the positive clones with a high activity for incorporation of acetyl-LDL labeled by 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate. CHO-MSR cells thus obtained were transfected with the wild-type HIR expression vector (SRαIR) and pSV2hph by the lipofection method. Clones resistant to 0.4 mg/ml hygromycin B were selected for the expression of HIR in the same way. CHO-MSR cells were also transfected with mutant-type HIR expression vector in which Lys1030 or Tyr972 was replaced by methionine (29Ebina Y. Araki E. Taira M. Shimada F. Mori M. Craik C.S. Siddle K. Pierce S.B. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and phenylalanine (30White M.F. Livingston J.N. Backer J.M. Lauris V. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 641-649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) (SRαIR1030M and SRαIR972F), respectively. Clones expressing wild- or mutant-type HIR obtained by hygromycin B selection were named as CHO-MSR-HIR, CHO-MSR-HIR1030M, and CHO-MSR-HIR972F cells, respectively. HIR-transfected CHO (CHO-HIR) cells were obtained by transfecting SRαIR and pSV2neo to parent CHO cells and selected against 0.4 mg/ml G418. Each clone expressing wild or mutant HIR thus obtained was subjected to the binding assay using125I-insulin. Briefly, cells in each well were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 0.03 nm125I-insulin in the presence of various concentrations (0–200 nm) of unlabeled insulin, washed three times, and the cell-bound radioactivity was measured as described previously (27Hayashi H. Miyake N. Kanai F. Shibasaki F. Takenawa T. Ebina Y. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The number of cell surface receptors was calculated by Scatchard analysis. Clones expressing 1.7–3.1 × 105receptors/cell were used in the present experiments. Except for the binding study, all cellular experiments were performed at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The endocytic uptake of 125I-AGE-BSA by LECs was measured as described previously (12Takata K. Horiuchi S. Araki N. Shiga M. Saitoh M. Morino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14819-14825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 5 × 106 of LECs were seeded and maintained in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium in 35-mm diameter wells, washed, and supplied with fresh medium containing 3% BSA and labeled ligands. The cells were incubated for 60 min with or without 10 nm insulin and indicated concentrations of125I-AGE-BSA (1.25–10 μg/ml) with or without 100-fold unlabeled AGE-BSA in 1.0 ml of KRH buffer (136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Hepes, 1 mg/ml glucose, and 30 mg/ml BSA). By contrast, the cells were incubated for 60 min with 2 μg/ml 125I-AGE-BSA and indicated concentrations of human insulin with or without 200 μg/ml unlabeled AGE-BSA in 1.0 ml of KRH buffer. Additionally, the cells were incubated with 10 nm wortmannin (31Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 30 min before and after the addition of 2 μg/ml 125I-AGE-BSA and 10 nminsulin. After 60-min incubation with 125I-AGE-BSA, 0.75 ml of the culture medium was taken from each well and mixed with 0.3 ml of 40% trichloroacetic acid in a vortex mixer. To this solution we added 0.2 ml of 0.7 m AgNO3, followed by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant (0.5 ml) was used to determine trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity, which was taken as an index of cellular degradation. The remaining cells in culture dishes were washed three times with PBS containing 1% BSA and three more times with PBS. The cells were lysed at 37 °C for 30 min with 1.0 ml of 0.1 n NaOH. One portion was used to determine the radioactivity as the cell-associated ligand, while the other portion was used to determine cellular proteins by BCA protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). The endocytic uptake of 125I-AGE-BSA in each transfected cell line was measured. RAW-HIR cells and mock-transfected RAW (RAW-mock) cells were cultured for 24 h on type IV collagen-coated wells (35 mm in diameter) in 1.0 ml of RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at the final cell density of 8 × 105cells/well. CHO-MSR-HIR cells, CHO-MSR cells, CHO-HIR cells, parent CHO cells, CHO-MSR-HIR1030M cells, and CHO-MSR-HIR972F cells were cultured for 24 h on type IV collagen-coated wells in 1.0 ml of F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FCS at a final cell density of 5 × 105cells/well. After serum starvation for 5 h, the cells were incubated for 60 min with 2 μg/ml 125I-AGE-BSA and selected concentrations of human insulin with or without 200 μg/ml unlabeled AGE-BSA in 1.0 ml of KRH buffer. Cell-associated ligands and ligands degraded by those cells were measured as exactly described above. To determine the effects of wortmannin, LY294002 (32Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and rapamycin (33Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar), CHO-MSR-HIR cells were pretreated for 30 min in 0.8 ml of KRH buffer with various concentrations of wortmannin, LY294002, rapamycin, and 0.1% of dimethyl sulfoxide as a vehicle, respectively. RAW-HIR cells were pretreated with these reagents in the same manner except for LY294002. In the next step, we added to the cells in each culture well 0.2 ml of KRH buffer containing labeled ligands to a final concentration of 2 μg/ml 125I-AGE-BSA in the absence or presence of 10 nm insulin. The endocytic degradations of125I-AGE-BSA and cell-associated 125I-AGE-BSA were determined as described above. The endocytic uptake (degradation and cell association) of 125I-acetyl-LDL by CHO-MSR-HIR cells was determined with 2 μg/ml 125I-acetyl-LDL similar to 125I-AGE-BSA. For the cellular binding study, the cells were cultured and subjected to serum starvation as described for the endocytic uptake assay. The cells in each well were preincubated for 60 min at 37 °C with or without 10 nm insulin, washed with ice-cold KRH buffer, and replaced with 1.0 ml of KRH buffer containing 1.25–20 μg/ml125I-AGE-BSA, in the absence or presence of 50-fold excess amounts of unlabeled ligand (50–1000 μg/ml). After incubation of the cells for 2 h at 4 °C, each well was washed three times with 1.0 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 1% BSA and three more times with PBS. The cells were lysed, and the cell-bound radioactivity and cellular proteins were determined as described above. Values are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired Student'st test. Differences between insulin-stimulated and control groups were considered significant at p < 0.05. As was shown previously (13Smedsrød B. Melkko J. Araki N. Sano H. Horiuchi S. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), 125I-AGE-BSA underwent effective receptor-mediated endocytosis by cultured LECs (Fig. 1, A and B). The endocytic uptake of 125I-AGE-BSA by these cells was significantly enhanced by the presence of 10 nm insulin; at ligand concentrations from 1.25 to 10 μg/ml, cell-associated125I-AGE-BSA was increased by 122–141%, and the amount of125I-AGE-BSA degraded was similarly increased by 113–134% above control (Fig. 1, A and B). When the dose-dependent effect of insulin was examined in the fixed amount of 125I-AGE-BSA, the amounts of cell-associated125I-AGE-BSA, as well as those degraded by LECs, were increased with insulin concentrations up to 1 nm and became a plateau somewhere between 1 and 10 nm, followed by gradual decline at an insulin concentration of 100 nm; cell-associated 125I-AGE-BSA was increased significantly from 775 to 1108 ng/mg of cell protein/h, and amounts of125I-AGE-BSA degraded were also increased significantly from 131 to 173 ng/mg of cell protein/h (Fig. 1, C and D). Under the identical conditions, the effect of 10 nm wortmannin, a reagent for PI3 kinase inhibitor, on the endocytosis was examined in the presence of 10 nm insulin. This drug completely reversed the insulin-induced increase of endocytosis to basal level, but slightly less than that of control (Fig. 1, C and D). These results suggest a potential link of an insulin signaling pathway to the endocytic system of LECs. Recent studies indicated that MSR expressed by these cells play a major role in the endocytic uptake of chemically modified proteins such as acetyl-LDL (21Ling W. Lougheed M. Suzuki H. Buchan A. Kodama T. Steinbrecher U.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and AGE proteins (13Smedsrød B. Melkko J. Araki N. Sano H. Horiuchi S. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, to understand the mechanism of insulin-enhanced endocytic uptake of AGE-BSA, we thought it reasonable to use RAW cells, a macrophage-like cell line that is known to express a high level of endogenous MSR (34Fraser I.

We first introduced HIR expression vector to macrophage-like RAW 294.7 cells, since recent studies have shown the MSR-mediated endocytic uptake of AGE proteins by macrophages and macrophage-derived cells (17Araki N.

The level of insulin receptor expressed in RAW-HIR cells was 1 × 105 receptors/cell, about 100 times higher than RAW cells; the endogenous level of insulin receptor in RAW cells was negligibly low (<103 receptors/cell) (data not shown). Endocytic uptake of 125I-AGE-BSA by RAW-HIR cells were examined in the presence of various concentrations of insulin. As shown in Fig. 2 A, insulin increased the amount of 125I-AGE-BSA associated with RAW-HIR cells from 128 to 154 ng/mg of cell protein, whereas RAW-mock cells were not influenced by the presence of insulin. The amount of125I-AGE-BSA degraded by RAW-HIR cells increased proportionately with insulin concentrations up to 1 nm, but decreased sharply at insulin concentrations of 10 and 100 nm (Fig. 2 B). The maximum level reached in the presence of 1 nm insulin was 90 ng/mg of cell protein, whereas the corresponding control level was 30 ng/mg of cell protein (Fig. 2 B). RAW-mock cells did not show such an insulin-dependent enhancement of endocytic degradation of125I-AGE-BSA. These results indicate that endocytic uptake and degradation of 125I-AGE-BSA by RAW-HIR cells is regulated by insulin. Since MSR is expected to mediate the endocytic degradation of AGE proteins by RAW cells, it is possible that insulin may act on MSR of RAW-HIR cells via transfected HIR. To test such possibility, CHO cells known to express a negligible level of MSR were coexpressed with MSR and HIR. CHO-MSR-HIR cells expressing 2.8 × 105 insulin receptors/cell (Table I) were used for endocytic uptake study. Fig. 3 B shows the endocytic degradation of 125I-AGE-BSA by these cells in the presence or absence of insulin. While the degradation activity of125I-AGE-BSA by control cells, such as CHO cells or CHO-HIR cells, was negligible, that of CHO-MSR cells was significant; the amount of 125I-AGE-BSA degraded by CHO-MSR cells for 60 min was about 6 ng/mg of cell protein and was not influenced by insulin. CHO-MSR-HIR cells showed the same level of degradation activity for125I-AGE-BSA at insulin concentrations less than 0.01 nm. However, endocytic degradation by these CHO-MSR-HIR cells was markedly enhanced in the presence of insulin in a dose-dependent manner; the amount of125I-AGE-BSA degraded increased from 6.0 to 8.7 ng/mg of cell protein by 1 nm insulin, reaching a plateau of 10 ng/mg of cell protein at 10 nm insulin. Thus, the maximal enhancement of degradation activity for 125I-AGE-BSA by CHO-MSR-HIR cells was about 1.7-fold. Since insulin-induced enhancement of endocytic degradation of 125I-AGE-BSA occurred only when CHO cells were coexpressed with MSR and HIR, it is likely that both MSR and HIR play an important role in insulin-sensitive endocytic uptake of125I-AGE-BSA.Table IInsulin binding to CHO cells expressing wild-type or mutant-type insulin receptorsCellsReceptors/cellCHO-MSR-HIR cells2.8 × 105CHO-MSR-HIR1030M cells1.7 × 105CHO-MSR-HIR972F cells2.2 × 105CHO-HIR cells3.1 × 105 Open table in a new tab The cell-associated 125I-AGE-BSA was also determined in these cells under identical conditions (Fig. 3 A).

The amount of cell-associated125I-AGE-BSA in CHO-MSR cells was not influenced by insulin. Similar to endocytic degradation of 125I-AGE-BSA (Fig. 3 B), insulin increased the amount of125I-AGE-BSA associated with CHO-MSR-HIR cells from 38 to 51 ng/mg of cell protein (Fig. 3 A).

Our previous studies led to the concept of two preprotein binding sites acting in series, the surface-exposed cis site and thetrans site exposed to the intermembrane space. We report here that preproteins are bound to the cis site in a labile fashion even at low ionic strength, whereas intermediates arrested at the trans site remained firmly bound at higher salt concentration. The stability of the trans site intermediate results from interactions of both the presequence and unfolded parts of the mature part of the preprotein with the TOM complex. Binding to thetrans site proceeded at rates comparable with those of unfolding of the mature domain and appeared to be kinetically limited by the unfolding reaction. Efficient binding to the transsite and unfolding were observed with both outer membrane vesicles and intact mitochondria whose membrane potential, ΔΨ, was dissipated. Upon re-establishing ΔΨ, trans site-bound preprotein resumed translocation into the matrix. The rates of unfolding and binding to the trans site were the same as those for translocation into intact energized mitochondria. We conclude that preprotein unfolding in intact mitochondria can take place without the involvement of the translocation machinery of the inner membrane and, in particular, the matrix Hsp70 chaperone.

Many of their subunits have been identified, but the detailed molecular events leading to the transfer of the proteins across the membranes are poorly understood. In some membrane systems, protein transport requires the unfolding of the translocating polypeptide chain. In mitochondria, targeting and translocation of a number of preproteins depends on cytosolic chaperones which keep the preproteins in a loosely folded, import-competent conformation (reviewed in Ref. 8Mihara K. Omura T. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 104-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Some mitochondrial preproteins contain folded domains and must unfold upon their interaction with the translocation machinery. It has been suggested that the mitochondrial Hsp70 (mtHsp70) 1The abbreviations used are: mtHsp70, mitochondrial Hsp70 chaperone; OMV, outer membrane vesicles; MPP, matrix processing peptidase; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MTX, methotrexate; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; HS, high salt; LS, low salt; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: mtHsp70, mitochondrial Hsp70 chaperone; OMV, outer membrane vesicles; MPP, matrix processing peptidase; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MTX, methotrexate; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; HS, high salt; LS, low salt; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. chaperone in conjunction with the translocation machinery of the inner membrane assists this unfolding reaction (9Neupert W.

According to one proposal, mtHsp70 participates in this process by actively “pulling” on the membrane-spanning polypeptide chain. A conformational change of mtHsp70 during the association with the preprotein is thought to be transduced into a directional force leading to the unfolding of domains still outside the mitochondrion (14Voos W. von Ahsen O. Müller H. Guiard B. Rassow J. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2668-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 15Matouschek A. Azem A. Ratliff K. Glick B.S. Schmid K. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6727-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In another view, mtHsp70 acts as part of a “molecular ratchet” which prevents the retrograde movement of the incoming polypeptide chain (16Ungermann C. Neupert W. Cyr D.M. Science. 1994; 266: 1250-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Unfolding in this case is essentially due to the spontaneous breathing of the folded domain and is coupled to the reversible movement of the unfolded polypeptide chain across the membranes and trapping in the matrix space by stable binding to mtHsp70.Using biochemical and genetic techniques, the TOM complex of the mitochondrial outer membrane has been shown to mediate specific recognition, unfolding, insertion, and translocation of preproteins (reviewed in Refs. 17Lill R.

Studies using intact mitochondria and isolated outer membrane vesicles (OMV) have provided a coarse picture of how preproteins containing N-terminal targeting signals (presequences) are translocated. At the mitochondrial surface, presequences are specifically recognized by the co-operative action of the receptors Tom20/Tom22 which form a presequence recognition site termed cis site (25Mayer A. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Lill R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4204-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 26Haucke V. Lithgow T. Rospert S. Hahne K. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5565-5570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). At this site, the preprotein is bound mainly through electrostatic interactions. Translocation of the preprotein is initiated by the transfer of its presequence across the outer membrane and binding at the so-called trans site (27Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The presequence of a trans site-bound preprotein is closely associated with the membrane-embedded component Tom40 (22Rapaport D. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18725-18731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and is exposed to the intermembrane space (27Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Preprotein binding at thetrans site is accompanied by unfolding of adjacent folded domains, a prerequisite for protein import into mitochondria (9Neupert W. Hartl F.-U. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. Cell. 1990; 63: 447-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar,28Eilers M. Schatz G. Cell. 1988; 52: 481-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).Essential features of preprotein translocation across the outer membrane, preprotein unfolding, and binding at the transsite are poorly understood. The rates of binding to thetrans site and the contribution of mature domains to the interaction have not been analyzed. Further, the physiological relevance of the unfolding activity of the outer membrane is unclear. The function of the trans site as an intermediate stage in preprotein translocation has not been established in intact mitochondria.Here, we present a biochemical characterization of the interaction of preproteins with the trans site, and we demonstrate the importance of this site as an intermediate state of translocation into intact mitochondria. Further, we present evidence that unfolding can occur at the stage of outer membrane translocation, i.e.before a contact between the preprotein and mtHsp70 chaperone is established. The unfolding event at the outer membrane was found to be rate-limiting for both the interaction of the preprotein with thetrans site and for the entire translocation process.RESULTSConditions were established under which preproteins were bound exclusively to either the cis or trans sites. We employed fusion proteins termed pSu9-DHFR or pCyt c1-DHFR comprised of the presequences of subunit 9 of the F0-ATPase or of cytochrome c1, respectively, and mouse DHFR. The preproteins were bound at 25 °C to purified mitochondrial outer membrane vesicles (OMV) in the presence or absence of MTX and NADPH. Addition of these compounds prevents the unfolding of the DHFR moiety and thus precludes preproteins from associating with thetrans site (27Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In the presence of MTX/NADPH, the preproteins remained bound exclusively at the surface-exposedcis site in a salt-sensitive fashion. Bound preprotein was completely released from the OMV upon treatment with buffer containing a high concentration of KCl (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, when incubated in the absence of MTX/NADPH, the preprotein remained bound to OMV even in buffers of high ionic strength (Fig. 1 B). Even after treatment with 600 mm KCl, only 40% of the bound preprotein was released from the OMV (not shown), indicating that ionic interactions play a minor role for the association with thetrans site. Binding to both cis and trans sites was largely dependent on the function of the surface receptors which can be degraded by treatment of the OMV with trypsin (25Mayer A. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Lill R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4204-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We conclude from these data that we can distinguish between preprotein binding to the cis and transsites of the mitochondrial outer membrane on the basis of their differential sensitivity to salt extraction. Binding in the presence or absence of MTX/NADPH combined with a treatment at low or high salt concentrations allows the exclusive occupation of either cisor trans sites.Using these criteria to discriminate between cis- and trans-site-bound preproteins, we investigated the time courses of preprotein binding to these two sites. At 25 °C, the association of pSu9-DHFR with the cis site occurred within seconds, whereas only slow binding with a half time of 5 min was observed for the trans site (Fig. 2 A). Binding to thetrans site was significantly slowed down after removal of the surface receptors by trypsin treatment. When preprotein binding to untreated OMV was performed at 0 °C instead of 25 °C, association with the cis site still took place rapidly, but negligible amounts of preprotein were bound to OMV in a salt-resistant fashion (Fig. 2 B), i.e. no association with thetrans site was detectable under these conditions.Figure 2Kinetic analysis of preprotein binding and unfolding at the cis and trans sites. A, pSu9-DHFR was bound in import buffer A to trypsin-treated (+TP) or mock-treated (−TP) OMV in the presence or absence of MTX/NADPH as described in Fig. 1. At the indicated times at 25 °C, aliquots were withdrawn and chilled on ice, and low salt (LS) or high salt (HS) buffer (containing 20 or 120 mm KCl, respectively) were added. OMV were reisolated and analyzed for preprotein binding as in Fig. 1. The maximal amount of bound preprotein in mock-treated samples was set to 100%. B, pSu9-DHFR was bound to OMV in import buffer A at 0 °C or 25 °C for the indicated time periods in the absence or presence of MTX/NADPH. Then, to those samples that had not received MTX/NADPH in the first place, these reagents were added to prevent further unfolding of pSu9-DHFR. After dilution with LS or HS buffers, OMV were reisolated and analyzed for bound preprotein as in Fig. 1. C, pSu9-DHFR was bound to OMV in import buffer A at 0 or 25 °C in the absence or presence of MTX/NADPH for the indicated time periods. Samples were then treated with 90 μg/ml proteinase K for 15 min at 0 °C to analyze the folding state of the DHFR domain. 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added, proteins were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid, and the unfolding of the DHFR domain was quantitated from the protease-resistant fraction of DHFR by phosphoimager analysis. D, pSu9-DHFR can be chased from the cis to the trans site. pSu9-DHFR was bound to the cis site of OMV either in the presence of methotrexate/NADPH (MTX) for 5 min at 25 °C (left panel) or in the absence of MTX for 5 min at 0 °C (right panel). The samples were adjusted to 35% sucrose and 20 mm KCl. To remove unbound pSu9-DHFR OMV were reisolated by flotation through a 300-μl layer of 32% sucrose in import buffer A, overlaid by 1 ml of import buffer A (10 min at 259,000 ×g, 2 °C). OMV were harvested and split into three aliquots. One was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (Total bound) and served as the 100% reference. The remaining two aliquots of the left panel were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C either in the presence (− chase) or absence (+chase) of MTX. Those of the right panel were incubated for 30 min at either 25 °C (+ chase) or 0 °C (− chase). The samples were adjusted to 100 mmKCl, and OMV were reisolated and analyzed for bound preprotein as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To analyze the time course of unfolding of the DHFR domain in these binding experiments, samples were treated with protease under conditions which leave folded DHFR intact, but completely degrade unfolded DHFR. During incubation at 25 °C in the absence of MTX/NADPH, unfolding occurred at a rate similar to that oftrans site binding (cf. Fig. 2, B and C). No unfolding was observed at 0 °C, consistent with the finding that no salt-resistant state was reached under this condition. Thus, stable binding of pSu9-DHFR to thetrans site of OMV is accompanied by the simultaneous unfolding of the DHFR domain. Binding to the trans site and/or unfolding of the mature part of the preprotein require incubation at higher temperature.Can the trans site be reached after binding to thecis site? pSu9-DHFR was pre-bound at the cis site either by incubation in the presence of MTX or at 0 °C, and unbound material was removed by centrifugation. When OMV carryingcis site-bound pSu9-DHFR were incubated at 25 °C in the absence of MTX, a significant fraction of the preprotein was translocated to the trans site as indicated by the resistance to treatment at increased ionic strength (Fig. 2 D). No translocation to the trans site was observed when the OMV were left on ice or were incubated in the presence of MTX. These data show that the cis site is used as an intermediate stage during preprotein translocation to thetrans site of the outer membrane.The lack of salt-resistant binding at 0 °C either could be due to the slow unfolding of the mature domain precluding translocation of the presequence across the outer membrane, or could result from a slow association of the preprotein with the trans site. In the first case, the rates of salt-resistant binding are expected to increase, if the preprotein harbors an unfolded DHFR domain. To test this experimentally, the preprotein pSu9-DHFR in the native form or after denaturation in 8 m urea (termed pSu9-DHFRurea) were incubated with OMV for various times at 15 °C and 0 °C. Then, OMV were treated with high salt buffer, reisolated and analyzed for bound preprotein. pSu9-DHFR became associated with OMV in a salt-resistant fashion at 15 °C but not at 0 °C (Fig. 3). In comparison, higher amounts of pSu9-DHFRurea were bound at both temperatures,i.e. the rates of salt-resistant binding of pSu9-DHFRurea were considerably higher than those of folded pSu9-DHFR. Thus, temperature-dependent unfolding of the mature domain determines how fast the presequence can be translocated across the outer membrane and can associate with the transsite. Treatment with urea circumvents this temperature dependence, demonstrating that presequence binding at the trans site is not a rate-limiting event.Figure 3Binding of preprotein to thetrans site is accelerated if the DHFR domain of pSu9-DHFR fusion protein is unfolded. OMV were incubated in import buffer A at 0 and 15 °C with pSu9-DHFR that was not (−Urea) or was (+Urea) unfolded by treatment with 8 m urea. After various time periods, samples were diluted with HS buffer, and salt-resistant preprotein binding to OMV was analyzed and quantitated as in Fig. 2 A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate whether the mature part of the preprotein contributes to salt-resistant binding at the trans site, we used a truncated preprotein (termed pSu9(+7); Ref. 22Rapaport D. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18725-18731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) consisting of the presequence of Su9 and only seven additional amino acid residues. Its binding under low and high salt conditions was compared with that of pSu9-DHFR. After incubation at 0 or 25 °C and treatment with low salt buffer, a large fraction of the added pSu9(+7) was bound to the OMV (Fig. 4 A). Following treatment with high salt buffer, only minor amounts of pSu9(+7) remained associated with the OMV. This was in contrast to pSu9-DHFR, which bound in a salt-resistant fashion at 25 °C. These data suggest that the mature part of the preprotein contributes to the stable binding at the trans site. A similar conclusion can be drawn from binding studies with pSu9-DHFRmut (carrying mutations in the DHFR domain which impair stable folding; Ref. 36Vestweber D. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1147-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and pSu9-DHFRurea. Both preproteins associated with OMV in a salt-resistant fashion, even when binding was performed at 0 °C (Fig. 4 B). In conclusion, preproteins can reach the salt-resistant binding state without the need for an increased temperature provided translocation is not hindered by a folded mature domain following the presequence. Unfolded segments of the mature portion of the polypeptide chain contribute to stable interaction with the translocation machinery of the outer membrane. Receptors are unlikely to play a major role in this interaction. The low amounts of pSu9-DHFR (Figs. 1 B and 2 A), pSu9-DHFRmut, and pSu9-DHFRurea (not shown) bound in the absence of receptors were associated in a salt-resistant fashion as was preprotein bound in the presence of receptors.Figure 4The mature part of pSu9-DHFR contributes to the stable binding at the trans site. A, pSu9-DHFR and pSu9(+7) were incubated in import buffer A with OMV for 20 min at 0 or 25 °C. The reaction mixtures were chilled on ice, and OMV were treated with low (LS) and high (HS) salt buffer before reisolation. The pellets were solubilized in sample buffer and analyzed for bound preprotein by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The lower panel represents a quantitation of the data by phosphoimager analysis. B, OMV were incubated with pSu9(+7), pSu9-DHFR, pSu9-DHFRmut, and with pSu9-DHFRureafor 20 min at 0 or 25 °C in import buffer A containing MTX/NADPH where indicated. Further treatment of the samples and the analysis of the data was as described in panel A. Data are presented as the fraction of preprotein recovered with OMV after high salt treatment and the amount recovered after low salt treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Do the reactions of presequence translocation and of concomitant unfolding of the mature portion of the preprotein observed with isolated outer membranes reliably reflect the import process in intact mitochondria? We first followed the unfolding of the DHFR domain during the incubation of pSu9-DHFR with isolated mitochondria, and we monitored the sequestration of the presequence cleavage site into the translocation channel. To uncouple translocation across the outer membrane from that across the inner membrane, isolated mitochondria were used whose membrane potential, ΔΨ, was depleted. Upon incubation of these mitochondria with pSu9-DHFR at 25 °C, the preprotein was bound rapidly, but the presequence was not cleaved by endogenous MPP, indicating that it had not been transferred across the inner membrane (Fig. 5, left panels). Nevertheless, the mature part of the preprotein became unfolded with a half time of less than 5 min (middle panels). The presequence cleavage site became inaccessible to externally added, purified MPP at virtually the same rate (right panels), indicating insertion of the presequence part of the preprotein into the outer membrane. Neither unfolding nor presequence sequestration was seen at 0 °C (not shown). Taken together, intact mitochondria can translocate the presequence of a preprotein across the outer membrane, and concomitantly the mature part of the preprotein unfolds. Both reactions occur independently of the further transfer of the polypeptide chain across the inner membrane.Figure 5Uncoupled mitochondria can unfold the mature part of preproteins and insert the presequence into the outer membrane. A, isolated mitochondria in import buffer B were treated with CCCP (24 μm), valinomycin (0.5 μm), oligomycin (8 μm), and antimycin A (20 μm) to deplete the membrane potential across the inner membrane. Radiolabeled pSu9-DHFR was added to the mitochondria, and samples were incubated for various times at 25 °C. The mitochondria were washed with SEM buffer containing 40 mm KCl, and reisolated (10 min, 10,000 × g). The pellets were resuspended in import buffer B containing the above concentrations of membrane potential-dissipating reagents. One aliquot was left untreated (Bound), another was treated with proteinase K (100 μg/ml; +PK) for 15 min at 0 °C, while the third aliquot was incubated with α- and β-MPP (20 μg/ml each) and 1.5 mm MnCl2 (+MPP). After precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, all samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. B, data of part A (bound pSu9-DHFR, proteinase K-resistant DHFR and processed mature Su9-DHFR) were quantitated by phosphoimager analysis and corrected for the loss of radioactive methionines upon presequence cleavage.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next asked if preprotein bound to the trans site represents a faithful intermediate of translocation into mitochondria. This has been questioned recently (37Moczko M. Bomer U. Kubrich M. Zufall N. Honlinger A. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6574-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The preprotein pSu9-DHFRurea was first bound to mitochondria which were uncoupled by the addition of CCCP. After removal of free orcis site-bound material by reisolation of the mitochondria in high salt buffer, the membrane potential, ΔΨ, was reestablished by the addition of dithiothreitol which quenches CCCP. A second incubation was performed to permit further transport oftrans site-bound preprotein into the matrix. A significant fraction of this preprotein acquired protection against proteinase K and its presequence was processed (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and 4) similar to what was observed for the import of preprotein freshly added before the second incubation (lanes 7 and 8). In contrast, hardly any proteinase K-resistant preprotein was detected when ΔΨ was lacking in both incubations (lanes 1 and 2 and 5 and 6). These data indicate that preprotein transiently arrested at the trans site resumed its journey into the matrix. Thus, the trans binding stage can be considered a productive intermediate of the overall translocation process.Figure 6Preprotein arrested at the transsite of intact mitochondria can be chased into the matrix.Mitochondria were preincubated with or without radiolabeled pSu9-DHFRurea for 5 min at 0 °C in import buffer C (250 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 10 μm CCCP to deplete the membrane potential, ΔΨ. After dilution of the samples with SEM buffer containing 120 mm KCl, mitochondria were reisolated and resuspended in import buffer C containing CCCP as above. One-half of each sample was left without further treatment (−ΔΨ), and the second half received 10 mm fresh dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, and 2 mm NADH (+ΔΨ). Then, to those samples which had not received radiolabeled pSu9-DHFRureain the first place, this preprotein was added. All samples were incubated for 20 min at 0 °C. Half of the samples were then subjected to treatment with proteinase K while the other half were left on ice. Further analysis of bound and imported preprotein was as in Fig. 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To prove that pSu9-DHFR bound to uncoupled mitochondria in a salt-resistant fashion was in intimate contact to the translocation machinery of the outer membrane, the TOM complex was isolated by immunoprecipitation using antibodies against Tom20, Tom22, and Tom40 and analyzed for bound preprotein. A significant fraction of added pSu9-DHFR was co-immunoprecipitated with the TOM complex after preprotein binding under conditions leading to occupation of thetrans site (Fig. 7). When the preprotein was arrested at the cis site, no such stable association with the TOM complex was seen, even when co-immunoprecipitation was performed in the presence of low salt concentrations. Essentially the same was observed with isolated OMV (not shown; 22). These data demonstrate that the preprotein, after inserting its presequence i"
https://openalex.org/W2065771006,"To determine the structural basis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-dependent activated protein C (APC) activity, we prepared a chimeric molecule in which the Gla domain and hydrophobic stack of protein C were replaced with the corresponding region of prothrombin. APC inactivation of factor Va was enhanced 10–20-fold by PE. Protein S enhanced inactivation 2-fold and independently of PE. PE and protein S had little effect on the activity of the chimera. Factor Va inactivation by APC was approximately 5-fold less efficient than with the chimera on vesicles lacking PE and slightly more efficient on vesicles containing PE. The cleavage patterns of factor Va by APC and the chimera were similar, and PE enhanced the rate of Arg506 and Arg306cleavage by APC but not the chimera. APC and the chimera bound to phosphatidylserine:phosphatidylcholine vesicles with similar affinity (Kd ≈ 500 nm), and PE increased affinity 2–3-fold. Factor Va and protein S synergistically increased the affinity of APC on vesicles without PE to 140 nm and with PE to 14 nm, but they were less effective in enhancing chimera binding to either vesicle. In a factor Xa one-stage plasma clotting assay, the chimera had ∼5 times more anticoagulant activity than APC on PE-containing vesicles. Unlike APC, which showed a 10 fold dependence on protein S, the chimera was insensitive to protein S. To map the site of the PE and protein S dependence further, we prepared a chimera in which residues 1–22 were derived from prothrombin and the remainder were derived from protein C. This protein exhibited PE and protein S dependence. Thus, these special properties of the protein C Gla domain are resident outside of the region normally hypothesized to be critical for membrane interaction. We conclude that the protein C Gla domain possesses unique properties allowing synergistic interaction with factor Va and protein S on PE-containing membranes.

Assembly of multiprotein enzyme complexes on negatively charged phospholipid membrane surfaces is critical to both the amplification of the blood clotting process and its negative regulation. Zymogen activations occur rapidly when the enzyme, usually a vitamin K-dependent protein, binds to a cofactor, usually a non-vitamin K-dependent protein, to activate a substrate, usually a vitamin K-dependent protein (reviewed in Refs.1Castellino F.J.

The enzymes and substrates interact with the membrane reversibly, while the cofactors may either bind reversibly or be integral membrane proteins. The nature of the phospholipid head group appears to contribute to catalytic and binding efficiency, with phosphatidylserine (PS) 1The abbreviations used are: PS, phosphatidylserine; APC, activated protein C; PC-PT Gla, a chimeric molecule in which the Gla domain and hydrophobic stack (residues 1–46) of protein C have been replaced with the corresponding regions of prothrombin; PC-PT Gla 1–22, a chimeric molecule in which residues 1–22 of the Gla domain of protein C have been replaced with the corresponding region of prothrombin; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PPACK, d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone; X-CP, the factor X activator from Russell's viper venom; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. being generally accepted as the most important phospholipid (2Mann K.G.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3226-3233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The vast majority of biophysical and kinetic studies of the assembly of the vitamin K dependent complexes have used membranes composed solely of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and PS (1Castellino F.J. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1995; 5: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 2Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev.

Recently, we observed that phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), a major constituent of the outer leaflet of the membrane of activated platelets (6Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 736: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), plays an important role in the function of one of these complexes, the activated protein C (APC)-dependent inactivation of factor Va (7Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, the presence of PE or cardiolipin potently enhanced the rate of inactivation. Subsequently, roles for PE in factor VIII binding (8Gilbert G.E. Arena A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18500-18505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), tissue factor-factor VIIa activation of factor X (9Neuenschwander P.F. Bianco-Fisher E. Rezaie A.R. Morrissey J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13988-13993Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and prothrombin activation (10Billy D. Willems G.M. Hemker H.C. Lindhout T. J. Biol.

Res. 1996; 81: 419-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have been reported. In the case of prothrombin activation, with PE present, the amount of PS required to support prothrombin activation was reduced severalfold. In the case of tissue factor, it was shown that the presence of PE enhanced activation primarily by decreasing the amount of PS required for optimal activation, and this was largely a Km effect on the substrate. The impact of PE on the inactivation of factor Va was substantially greater than on the other systems. For prothrombin activation and tissue factor-mediated factor X activation, the augmentation by PE could be overcome simply by increasing PS concentration, whereas the PE impact on factor Va inactivation was not eliminated by similar increases in PS concentration (7Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein C, like the other vitamin K-dependent proteins, is composed of several domains (3Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). These include the protease domain, two epidermal growth factor-like domains, an aromatic stack, and the vitamin K-dependent Gla domain containing the Gla residues. These Gla residues are involved in Ca2+-dependent membrane binding and are clustered within the amino-terminal 48 residues of the vitamin K-dependent plasma factors (1Castellino F.J. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1995; 5: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 3Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 12Mann K.G. Krishnaswamy S. Lawson J.H. Sem. Hematol. 1992; 29: 213-226PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of these proteins within this region are similar, but the number of Gla residues varies from 9 to 12 (3Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). Since the Gla domains are implicated in the membrane binding and membrane-dependent catalytic activity (1Castellino F.J. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1995; 5: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 13Christiansen W.T. Jalbert L.R. Robertson R.M. Jhingan A. Prorok M. Castellino F.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3590-3595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that the differences in PE-dependent behavior between protein C and the other complexes might be mediated by the Gla domains. To test this possibility, we have prepared a chimeric form of protein C in which the entire Gla domain or only the portion from residue 1 to 22 has been exchanged with that of prothrombin in an effort to evaluate the regions of the molecules involved in the PE-dependent activities. Other chimeric proteins with protein C with the Gla domain of factor VII (15Geng J.-P. Castellino F.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 77: 926-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and factor IX (16Christiansen W.T. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5901-5911Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have been prepared previously and are known to be active, but these have not been examined for their PE dependence or their ability to interact with protein S. The mechanisms by which APC inactivates factor Va in biological systems are complex and not fully understood. It is known that cleavage at Arg506 results in partial loss of activity (17Egan J.O. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2016-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but the extent of inactivation is dependent on the assay conditions with high factor Xa levels resulting in lower apparent inactivation. Cleavage of Arg306 leads to total inactivation (18Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27246-27257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the release of a portion of the factor Va molecule (19Mann K.G. Hockin M.F. Begin K.J. Kalafatis M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20678-20683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The function of protein S in this process is controversial. In purified systems, protein S enhances the rate of factor Va inactivation about 2-fold (Ref. 7Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). In plasma, however, APC anticoagulant activity is strongly dependent on protein S. When protein S is removed, it requires approximately 10-fold more APC to achieve the same anticoagulant effect. One function of protein S appears to be to favor cleavage of Arg306 (20Rosing J. Hoekema L. Nicolaes G.A.F. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Hemker H.C. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Tans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27852-27858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Factor Xa can protect factor Va from inactivation by APC (21Nesheim M.E. Canfield W.M. Kisiel W. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1443-1447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Solymoss S. Tucker M.M. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14884-14890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this protection is primarily due to blocking cleavage at Arg506 (20Rosing J. Hoekema L. Nicolaes G.A.F.

Protein S overcomes the factor Xa protection of factor Va (20Rosing J. Hoekema L. Nicolaes G.A.F. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Hemker H.C. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Tans G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 14884-14890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been difficult to detect protein S interaction with APC in solution, but interaction has been detected with bovine APC by light scattering (23Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11128-11131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with human APC by fluorescence energy transfer approaches on membranes (24Yegneswaran S. Wood G.M. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25013-25021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The change in active site-membrane distance brought about through interaction with protein S (24Yegneswaran S. Wood G.M. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25013-25021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) may contribute to the selective effect on cleavage at Arg306. Protein S and factor V have also been shown to work synergistically in the inactivation of factor Va by APC (25Shen L. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18735-18738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Varadi K. Rosing J. Tans G. Pabinger I. Keil B. Schwarz H.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition, a wide variety of studies have suggested that protein S contributes to the plasma anticoagulant response by binding to factor Xa (27Heeb M.J. Rosing J. Bakker H.M. Fernandez J.A. Tans G.

The importance of understanding the mechanisms by which the system is modulated stems from the clinical observations that protein C and protein S deficiency create thrombotic risk and that one of the most common risk factors related to venous thrombosis involves a substitution of Arg with Gln at position 506 in factor V, a trait referred to as APC resistance or factor V Leiden (32Dahlbäck B. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Development of an APC mutant that does not interact with protein S would provide a useful approach for testing the importance of the direct inhibition of prothrombinase in the anticoagulant activity of APC in plasma and aiding in our understanding of how protein S functions. Human thrombin and prothrombin (33Owen W.G. Esmon C.T. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 594-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), human APC (34Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. Le Bonniec B.F.

T., The Function of Factor V in Prothrombin Activation.Ph.D. dissertation, 1973, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously. Meizothrombin labeled in the active site with fluorescein was prepared as described by Armstrong et al. (39Armstrong S.A. Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6210-6218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Bock (40Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6633-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recombinant human protein C was a generous gift from Dr. Brian Grinnell (Lilly). Bovine serum albumin (BSA), Russell's viper venom, ovalbumin, gelatin, MOPS, Tris-HCl, and salts were from Sigma. The chromogenic substrates Spectrozyme TH and Spectrozyme PCa were from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-PS, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-PC, and 1,2-dilinoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-PE were from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. 1-Palmitoyl-2-[1-14C-oleoyl]PC was from NEN Life Science Products. Factor V-deficient human plasma was from George King Bio-Medical, Inc. (Overland Park, KS). The human factor Va used for gel time courses was prepared by a modification of the method of Kane and Majerus (41Kane W.H. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1002-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibitors added to the original plasma included diisopropyl fluorophosphate (1 mm) (Sigma), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μm) (Sigma), d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (PPACK, 5 μm) (Calbiochem),d-Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (5 μm) (Calbiochem), leupeptin hemisulfate (1 μg/ml) (Calbiochem), aprotinin (5 μg/ml) (Calbiochem), and benzamidine HCl (10 mm). PEG 8000 was used in place of the PEG 6000. After barium citrate elution, the material was immunopurified using a monoclonal antibody, V227, which was prepared by standard techniques (34Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. Le Bonniec B.F. Johnson A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 359-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The antibody was linked to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) at 5 mg/ml. The partially purified factor V from 2 liters of plasma in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02 mTris-HCl, pH 7.5 (TBS), 10 mm benzamidine was batch-adsorbed with 25 ml of antibody resin for 3 h, poured into a 2.5 × 10-cm column, and washed rapidly with TBS, 5 mmbenzamidine (100 ml), 0.5 m NaCl, 0.02 mTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm Ca2+ (100 ml) and TBS, 1 mm Ca2+. The factor V was eluted with 50% ethylene glycol, 1 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mmCa2+ at 5 ml/h. After dialysis into TBS, 1 mmCa2+, the factor V was activated by incubation with 1 unit/ml bovine thrombin at 37 °C for 10 min. The thrombin was inactivated by the addition ofp-(amidinophenyl)-methanesulfonyl fluoride (5 μm) (Calbiochem). The factor Va for all other experiments was from Hematologic Technologies. The specific activity of the two preparations were equivalent, but the commercial material had too many additional cleavage products within the preparation to allow gel time course analysis. Sonicated or extruded vesicles were prepared as described (7Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless indicated, PS/PC vesicles were 20% PS, 80% PC, and PE/PS/PC vesicles were 50% PE, 20% PS, 30% PC. Sonicated vesicles were used for light scattering and adsorption to the latex beads. These vesicles were characterized by electron microscopy. PS/PC vesicles were 20–25 nm in diameter, and the PE/PS/PC vesicles were 100–200 nm (42Smirnov M.D. Triplett D.T. Comp P.C. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 309-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, lipids were mixed in the weight proportions indicated, dried under argon, and lyophilized overnight to remove organic solvents. They were then reconstituted in 0.15 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.02% sodium azide to 2 mg of total lipid/ml and sonicated (Bronson Sonic Power Co., model 350) for 15 min in an ice-water bath under argon flow, centrifuged at 8000 × g for 15 min, and filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. For kinetic and clotting studies, 100-nm vesicles were prepared with a 100-nm Nucleopore membrane in an extruder (Avestin) to ensure comparable size. The vesicles were used immediately or stored at +20 °C. Storage did not alter vesicle activity. The protein C chimera was constructed in which the first three exons of prothrombin (i.e. coding for the signal peptide, the Gla domain, and the aromatic stack regions) replaced the corresponding regions of protein C. The construction, expression, and isolation of the chimera was done by standard methods as described previously (43Regan L.M. Mollica J.S. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26279-26284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A separate chimera, PC-PT Gla 1–22, was prepared to map the PE and protein S dependence further. PC-PT Gla 1–22 is a chimeric protein C molecule in which the signal peptide and residues 1–22 of the prothrombin Gla domain replaced the corresponding residues of protein C.

In the first round, the protein C cDNA was amplified with the sense primer 5′-tgcgtggaggagacgtgcGACTTCGAGGAGGCCAAGGA-3′ (primer 1), which contains 18 bases (lowercase) from the prothrombin Gla domain (coding for residues Cys17–Cys22) and starts from the Asp23 of protein C.

The polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragments were isolated by standard procedures. These fragments were combined and then used as a template for a second round of polymerase chain reaction amplification using primers 2 and 3. The final product was digested with HindIII and XbaI and subcloned into the identical sites of pRc/RSV (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), expressed and isolated as described previously (43Regan L.M.

Gla residue determinations were kindly performed by Dr. Betty Yan and Cindy Payne at Eli Lilly Research Laboratory or in our laboratory (44Smalley D.M. Preusch P.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The Gla content per mol of protein obtained was as follows: 8.7 ± 0.3 for protein C, 10.9 ± 0.2 for prothrombin, 9.5 ± 0.2 for PC-PT Gla, and 10.3 ± 0.4 for APC-PT Gla. Factor Va inactivation was analyzed with a three-stage assay essentially as described (see Ref. 7Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for experimental details). All reactions were run at room temperature in 96-well polyvinyl chloride plates (Costar). All reagents were diluted in TBS containing 1 mg/ml gelatin, 1 mg/ml ovalbumin, and 10 mg/ml BSA (TBS-GOB). Briefly, factor Va (0.2 nm unless noted) was incubated with APC or the chimera in the first stage for 30 min with phospholipid in the presence or absence of protein S. The concentrations of reactants are indicated in the figure legends. In the second stage, after inhibition of APC with p-(amidinophenyl)-methanesulfonyl fluoride (30 μm), residual factor Va activity was monitored by its ability to enhance prothrombin activation in the presence of excess factor Xa (1 nm), prothrombin (1.4 μm), and 5 mm CaCl2. In experiments utilizing 20 nm factor Va in the first stage because sample dilution was necessary, additional lipid (PS/PC, 10 μg/ml) was also added in this stage. After 5 min of activation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA, and the resultant thrombin was measured in the third stage using a chromogenic assay. Remaining factor Va activity was calculated by dividing thrombin formation in the presence of APC by thrombin formation in its absence. Clotting was initiated at the level of factor X activation by use of X-CP. All reagents were diluted in TBS containing 1 mg/ml gelatin. Assays were performed in 96-well plates. To dilutions of APC (20 μl) were added 10 μl of phospholipid at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends, 10 μl of 20 ng/ml X-CP, and 20 μl of normal pooled plasma. The entire mixture was incubated for 1 min. Clotting was initiated by the addition of 25 μl of 20 mm CaCl2. The clotting time was determined on a Vmax Kinetic Microplate Reader as the time to reach the threshold optical density value of 0.02 at 405 nm above the plasma reading before the initiation of clotting. This value corresponds to ∼10% of the increase in optical density of fully clotted plasma. The progress curves were examined for all reactions to ensure that this cut off accurately reflected the clotting process. A 10% suspension of polystyrene latex beads (Sigma) (50 μl) was pelleted in Eppendorf tubes, washed three times with TBS by centrifugation at 8,000 ×g for 1 min, and resuspended in 50 μl of TBS, 5 mm CaCl2. Liposomes (100 μl at 1 mg/ml total phospholipid in TBS) were added and incubated 2 h at 37 °C with shaking. After two washes, the beads were resuspended in TBS-GOB and further incubated for 2 h at room temperature with shaking. After two additional washes with TBS, the beads were resuspended in 500 μl of T"
https://openalex.org/W2026815883,"Interactions between transcription factors are an important means of regulating gene transcription, leading to modifications in the pattern of gene expression and cell fate. In this study, we report that the progesterone receptor (PR) can strongly interfere with transactivation mediated by the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in T47D breast cancer cells. This interference was not only demonstrated by induction of a transfected dioxin-responsive reporter plasmid but also on the AhR-mediated up-regulation of the endogenous cytochrome P450-1A1 activity. The interference was not mutual, as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), the most potent activator of the AhR, did not inhibit progestin-induced promoter activity. When the isoforms of the human PR, hPR-A and hPR-B, were expressed separately in HepG-2 hepatocarcinoma cells, both negatively interfered with the AhR signaling, indicating that the effect is not restricted to T47D cells. In addition, results obtained from studies with both antiprogestins and mutant receptors indicate differences in the underlying molecular mechanisms of repression for both PR isoforms. The suppression by hPR-A does not require additional gene expression or a full transcriptional competent conformation of the receptor. For the repressive effects of hPR-B, however, additional gene expression seems to be involved, as only the agonist-bound, wild-type hPR-B could clearly repress the TCDD-induced response. In conclusion, these studies highlight different mechanisms of repression for the progesterone receptor isoforms on the AhR-mediated trans-activation and underscore the importance of interactions between transcription factors of different families in the regulation of gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2128402256,"The aim of this study was to determine if cultured porcine vascular smooth muscle cells (pSMCs) that had been maintained on different extracellular matrix proteins had an alteration in their expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5) and their responsiveness to insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). When pSMCs were plated on fibronectin, they synthesized 6.0 ± 1.2-fold more IGFBP-5 than did cells maintained on laminin and type IV collagen. IGF-I increased IGFBP-5 gene expression 3-fold in the cells plated on fibronectin. The addition of an RGD peptide and echistatin to pSMC cultures that had been plated on fibronectin inhibited IGFBP-5 mRNA expression. The addition of an antibody against α2β1 integrin partially reversed the inhibitory effects of laminin and type IV collagen on IGFBP-5 expression. Cells maintained on fibronectin had a 5.0 ± 1.1-fold greater DNA synthesis response to IGF-I compared with those maintained on laminin/type IV collagen, and echistatin significantly inhibited the DNA synthesis response of the fibronectin-maintained cells to IGF-I. The anti-α2β1 antibody partially reversed the inhibitory effect of laminin and type IV collagen on IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis. The addition of IGFBP-5 to cultures plated on laminin and type IV collagen significantly increased their response to IGF-I. Atherosclerotic plaques from pig aorta contained abundant fibronectin and had increased IGFBP-5 mRNA (4.5 ± 1.5-fold) compared with tissue from the normal vessel wall that had a low fibronectin content.

Hedin U. Sjolund M. Palmberg L. Bottger B.A. Artherosclerosis. 1990; 10: 966-990Crossref Scopus (483) Google Scholar). They are quiescent, and the proliferative index is low (1Thyberg J. Hedin U. Sjolund M. Palmberg L. Bottger B.A. Artherosclerosis. 1990; 10: 966-990Crossref Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In contrast, SMCs in the neointima seem to have dedifferentiated. This dedifferentiation includes a marked structural reorganization of the cells, with loss of myofilaments and the formation of an extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum and large Golgi complex (2Ross R. Wight T.N. Strandness E. Thiele B. Am. J. Pathol. 1984; 114: 79-93PubMed Google Scholar, 3Moss P.R.L. Campbell G.C. Wang Z.L. Campbell J.H. Lab. Invest. 1995; 53: 556-562Google Scholar, 4Moss P.R.L. Campbell G.R. Campbell J.H. Artherosclerosis. 1986; 6: 664-669Crossref Google Scholar). Their abundance of smooth muscle α-actin decreases, whereas the expression of nonmuscle β- and γ-actin increases (2Ross R. Wight T.N. Strandness E. Thiele B. Am. J. Pathol. 1984; 114: 79-93PubMed Google Scholar, 3Moss P.R.L. Campbell G.C. Wang Z.L. Campbell J.H. Lab. Invest. 1995; 53: 556-562Google Scholar, 4Moss P.R.L. Campbell G.R. Campbell J.H. Artherosclerosis. 1986; 6: 664-669Crossref Google Scholar). They synthesize increased amounts of fibronectin and deposit it into their extracellular matrix (ECM). This is termed the synthetic phenotype, and these cells have acquired the ability to proliferate, migrate, and synthesize ECM in response to stimulation by growth factors and cytokines (5Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9930) Google Scholar). Additionally, cells in the synthetic phenotype constitutively synthesize peptide growth factors, and they have the ability to replicate in the absence of exogenously added mitogens (1Thyberg J. Hedin U. Sjolund M. Palmberg L. Bottger B.A. Artherosclerosis. 1990; 10: 966-990Crossref Scopus (483) Google Scholar).Extracellular matrix has been shown to play an important role in the modulation of the SMC phenotype in culture (6Hedin U. Bottger B.A. Forsberg E. Johansson S. Thyberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 109: 307-319Crossref Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Aortic SMCs assume the synthetic phenotype when they are cultured on a fibronectin substratum and will proliferate in response to stimulation by appropriate growth factors. In contrast, if the cells are cultured on laminin and type IV collagen, they will remain in the contractile phenotype. These ECM proteins function by binding to their integrin receptors on the cell surface. Cultured SMCs express the α5β1 and αVβ3 integrins, which bind fibronectin, and the α2β1 integrin, which binds to laminin and several forms of collagen (7Assoian R.K. Marcantonio E.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2436-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).The growth and differentiation of SMCs are modulated by a number of peptide growth factors, including the IGFs. SMCs in culture have been shown to synthesize IGF-I, and IGF-I stimulates SMC proliferation in an autocrine fashion (8Clemmons D.R. Circ. Res. 1985; 56: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Bornfeldt K.E. Arnqvist H.L. Norstedt G. J. Endocrinol. 1990; 125: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 10Delafontaine P. Lou H. Alexander R.W. Hypertension. 1991; 18: 742-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In vivo, IGF-I mRNA and immunoreactive IGF-I are detected in atherosclerotic lesions that develop after injury (11Grant M.B. Wargovich T.J. Ellis E.A. Caballer O.S. Mansour M. Pepine C.J. Circulation. 1994; 89: 1511-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and the increase in IGF-I mRNA and immunoreactive peptide after balloon denudation injury precedes an associated increase in SMC proliferation (12Cercek B. Fishbein M.C. Forrester J.S. Helfant R.H. Fagin J.A. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 1755-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 13Khorsandi M.J. Fagin J.A. Giannella-Neto D. Forrester J.S. Cercek B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). IGF-I has also been shown to stimulate SMC migration (14Jones J.I. Prevette T. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2482-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and this response is mediated by the IGF-I receptors but also requires ligand occupancy of the αVβ3 integrin. This ligand occupancy of integrins may play a role in controlling IGF-I responsiveness.The bioactivities of IGFs are modulated by a group of specific, high affinity IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) (15Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that porcine aortic SMCs secrete IGFBP-2, -4, and -5 (16Cohick W.S. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17Duan C. Hawes S.B. Prevette T. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4280-4288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and that IGFBP-5 can modulate IGF-I-stimulated cell proliferation and migration (18Imai Y. Busby W.H. Smith C.E. Clarke J.B. Horvitz G.D. Rees C. Clemmons D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2596-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because modulation of their phenotypic state alters pSMC responses to peptide growth factors, we determined the ability of specific EMC components to regulate IGFBP-5 expression and the responsiveness of these cells to IGF-I.DISCUSSIONIn normal blood vessels, SMCs are attached to a basement membrane that contains type IV collagen and laminin. Within the arterial wall, most SMCs are maintained in a quiescent state and express contractile protein isoforms. However, in response to vascular injury, SMCs alter their phenotype and are stimulated to proliferate and migrate. This phenotypic transition from the contractile to the synthetic state is accompanied by enhanced expression of specific matrix proteins such as fibronectin (9Bornfeldt K.E. Arnqvist H.L. Norstedt G. J. Endocrinol. 1990; 125: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The phenotypic transition can be modulated in vitro by changing the composition of ECM substratum (6Hedin U. Bottger B.A. Forsberg E. Johansson S. Thyberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 109: 307-319Crossref Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Aortic SMCs have been reported to convert to the synthetic phenotype when cultured on a fibronectin substratum, and, if maintained on fibronectin, they will proliferate if they are also exposed to appropriate growth factors. In contrast, if the cells are cultured on laminin plus type IV collagen, early passage (e.g. <p5) cells can be maintained in a nonproliferative state for 1 week (6Hedin U. Bottger B.A. Forsberg E. Johansson S. Thyberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 109: 307-319Crossref Scopus (323) Google Scholar). This was confirmed in our study by showing abundant expression of smooth muscle α-actin and an increased number of microfilament bundles that stained for α-actin. In contrast, cells that were plated and maintained on fibronectin had much lower α-actin content. Based on these results, we believe that the in vitro modulation of the pSMC phenotype was similar to that previously reported by others (6Hedin U. Bottger B.A. Forsberg E. Johansson S. Thyberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 109: 307-319Crossref Scopus (323) Google Scholar).A major finding in the present study is that, compared with cells cultured on laminin and type IV collagen, pSMCs cultured on fibronectin synthesize and release more IGFBP-5. The increase in IGFBP-5 synthesis is associated with increased IGFBP-5 mRNA expression. The effect becomes manifest between the 2nd and 4th days after changing the ECM substratum. The effect is specific for IGFBP-5 as IGFBP-2 protein and mRNA levels were unaltered by the ECM proteins. This suggests that expression of this gene may be an important component of phenotype transition. Because IGFBP-5 has been shown to potentiate the cellular growth-promoting effect of IGF-I (23Jones J.I. Gockerman A. Busby W.H. Camacho-Hubner C. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), this may be relevant to the observation noted by several groups that synthetic phenotype cells are more responsive to growth factors (9Bornfeldt K.E. Arnqvist H.L. Norstedt G. J. Endocrinol. 1990; 125: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,24Clyman R.I. Mauray F. Kramer R.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 25Dartsch P.C. Voisaid R. Bauridel G. Hotling B. Betz E. Atherosclerosis. 1990; 10: 62-75Google Scholar, 26Chambley-Campbell J.H. Campbell G.R. Ross R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 89: 379-383Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This conclusion is strengthened by our observation that the addition of IGFBP-5 to cultures plated on laminin/type IV collagen enhanced their DNA synthesis response to IGF-I, suggesting that the enhanced expression of IGFBP-5 in the fibronectin-exposed cultures may be an important component of this enhanced replication response to IGF-I.These changes were also reflected in the IGFBP-5 synthesis response to IGF-I. We had previously shown that IGF-I induced a 6-fold increase in IGFBP-5 mRNA (17Duan C. Hawes S.B. Prevette T. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4280-4288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); therefore, we analyzed the responses of pSMC that expressed each phenotype. Although pSMC plated on fibronectin had a greater increase in IGFBP-5 expression in response to IGF-I, cultures maintained in the nonproliferative phenotype still showed some IGF-I responsiveness. There are two possible interpretations of this result. First, fibronectin is acting to directly stimulate basal (non-IGF-I dependent) IGFBP-5 expression and to enhance the response to IGF-I. This conclusion is supported by our data showing that peptide antagonists of ligand binding to αVβ3 and α5β1 can inhibit IGFBP-5 expression. Second, it is also possible that a low percentage of cells have not been maintained in the nonproliferative phenotype and, therefore, have acquired IGF-I responsiveness. In either case, it seems that the synthetic phenotype cells are more responsive to IGF-I. In addition to modulating the IGFBP-5 synthesis response to IGF-I, plating pSMC on different substrata modulated the DNA synthesis response. This effect also seemed to be ECM protein-mediated as cells that were plated on laminin/type IV collagen had a reduced DNA synthesis response to IGF-I compared with the response of cells plated on fibronectin.To test the hypothesis that the effects of these ECM molecules were mediated by their respective integrins, pSMCs were incubated with an antibody or peptides that bind to and block integrin ligand occupancy. The adherence of pSMCs to matrix-coated plates was unaffected by preincubating the cells with either RGD peptide or the antibody at the indicated concentrations. These results indicate that the effect of fibronectin on IGFBP-5 expression is mediated by α5β1 and αVβ3integrins, as both the RGD peptide and echistatin, a disintegrin that has been shown to block fibronectin binding to αVβ3 integrin, inhibited the induction of IGFBP-5 by fibronectin. Because we have previously shown that vitronectin binding to αVβ3 is required for pSMC to migrate in response to IGF-I and because echistatin also blocked the IGFBP-5 response to IGF-I, it is likely that αVβ3 occupancy by fibronectin is also augmenting this response. In contrast to fibronectin, exposure to type IV collagen/laminin resulted in maintenance of IGFBP-5 expression at a low level. When occupancy of the α2β1integrin was blocked with the P1E6 antibody, this inhibition of IGFBP-5 expression could be partially reversed. This strongly suggests that α2β1 integrin ligand occupancy is acting to inhibit IGFBP-5 expression. Additionally, the effects of these ECM proteins on IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis seem to be integrin mediated as blocking binding to α2β1 or αVβ3partially reversed the effects of these ligands on IGF-I-stimulated replication. Taken together, these results support the conclusion that the effects of the ECM proteins used in this study are integrin mediated and that integrin ligand occupancy modulates IGF-I responsiveness. Therefore, the capacity of this growth factor to stimulate pSMC replication is directly related to the context in which the growth factor signal is presented to its cognate receptor.IGFs exert multiple effects on target cells that are mediated by the IGF-I receptor on the cell surface. IGF-I has been shown to stimulate proliferation as well as migration of pSMC (14Jones J.I. Prevette T. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2482-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In addition to the direct influences on the cells, IGF-I exposure is also required for the full activity of several other growth factors or cytokines. IGF-I has been shown to enhance the effects of platelet-derived growth factor (27Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), thrombin (28Delafontaine P. Anwar A. Lou H. Ku L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and angiotensin II (29Delafontaine P. Lou H. J. Biol.

Selective inhibition of IGF-I binding to its receptor with anti-IGF-I antibody results in marked reduction in the mitogenic response to thrombin (28Delafontaine P. Anwar A. Lou H. Ku L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and angiotensin II (29Delafontaine P. Lou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16866-16870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, IGF-I mRNA and immunoreactive IGF-I are detected in intimal lesions that develop in humans (11Grant M.B. Wargovich T.J. Ellis E.A. Caballer O.S. Mansour M. Pepine C.J. Circulation. 1994; 89: 1511-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). IGF-I mRNA and immunoreactive IGF-I levels both increase severalfold after balloon denudation injury in rats, and these increases are temporally preceded by an increase in SMC proliferation (12Cercek B. Fishbein M.C. Forrester J.S. Helfant R.H. Fagin J.A. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 1755-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 13Khorsandi M.J. Fagin J.A. Giannella-Neto D. Forrester J.S. Cercek B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, IGF-I may be important for SMC proliferation and migration in vivo and may play an important role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions.Our findings suggest that variables such as enhanced binding of fibronectin to αVβ3 or increased binding of type IV collagen to α2β1 may also modulate responsiveness of pSMC to other growth factors. Recent studies have shown that ligand occupancy of the αVβ3integrin functions to regulate growth factor actions. Platelet-derived growth factor (30Bilato C. Curto K.A. Monticone R.E. Pauly R.R. White A.J. Crow M.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and IGF-I (14Jones J.I. Prevette T. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2482-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) have a diminished capacity to stimulate cell migration if ligand occupancy of this integrin is attenuated. Similarly blocking integrin or growth factor receptor-associated signaling pathways, such as induction of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and inositol phosphate-3 formation, results in inhibition of migration (30Bilato C. Curto K.A. Monticone R.E. Pauly R.R. White A.J. Crow M.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The mechanistic explanations that have been proposed to explain these observations include coactivation of signal transduction elements by growth factor tyrosine kinase receptors and integrins such as insulin receptor substrate-1 (31Vuori K. Rhoslahti E. Science. 1994; 266: 1576-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) or calmodulin-II kinase (32Pauly R.R. Bilato C. Sollott S.J. Monticone R. Kelly P.T. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. Circulation. 1995; 91: 1107-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33Bilato C. Pauly R.R. Melillo G. Monticone R. Gorelick-Feldman D. Gluzband Y.A. Sollott S.J. Ziman B. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1905-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and, in the case of fibroblast growth factor, direct activation of the receptor kinase activity by integrin occupancy (34Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamado K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that the αVβ3 occupancy is activating IGF-I signaling, resulting in not only enhanced migration but also in enhanced replication. In contrast, no studies have been reported to date that blocking ligand occupancy of α2β1will enhance growth factor actions. In the case of platelet-derived growth factor, occupancy of this integrin was stated to enhance the SMC migration response (35Skinner M.D. Raines E.W. Ross R. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 170-176Google Scholar). Therefore, further studies that are directed toward elucidating the mechanism by which α2β1 occupancy is inhibiting IGF-I actions are warranted.IGF bioactivities are modified by a family of six high affinity IGFBPs. Among them, IGFBP-5 has the unique property of adhering tightly to ECM (23Jones J.I. Gockerman A. Busby W.H. Camacho-Hubner C. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). When associated with ECM, the affinity of IGFBP-5 is lowered 8-fold. This affinity shift results in a more favorable equilibrium between IGF-I bound to ECM-associated IGFBP-5 and to the IGF-I receptor, and this is associated with an enhanced cellular DNA synthesis response to IGF-I. Additionally, the amount of ECM-associated IGFBP-5 has been shown to be related to the degree of enhancement of the cellular growth response (23Jones J.I. Gockerman A. Busby W.H. Camacho-Hubner C. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was confirmed by our results showing that the addition of IGFBP-5 to cultures that were plated on laminin and type IV collagen significantly increased the cellular response to IGF-I. Therefore, factors such as the induction of IGFBP-5 synthesis by fibronectin could result in further enhancement of the cellular responses to IGF-I. Similarly, an increase in the affinity of αVβ3 for its ligands, which occurs following IGF-I binding to its receptor (14Jones J.I. Prevette T. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2482-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), may contribute to this response.These observations may have some relevance to the development of atherosclerotic lesions in vivo. This study demonstrated that atherosclerotic lesions contain more IGFBP-5 mRNA compared with comparable amounts of normal vessel wall. Although several cell types exist in atherosclerotic plaques, SMCs are the predominant cell type (5Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9930) Google Scholar). Similarly, as the SMCs within lesions have assumed the synthetic phenotype and because fibronectin is much more abundant, it is possible that the increase that we observed in IGFBP-5 mRNA content in lesions reflects the differences that we observed in pSMC cultures in vitro and that this increase could be related to lesion enlargement. Because the αVβ3integrin is not expressed in normal vessel wall but is abundant in atherosclerotic lesions (36Hoshiga A. Smith L.L. Giachelli C.M. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), it is possible that this change also contributes to enhanced IGFBP-5 expression. Furthermore, because other ECM proteins that bind to αVβ3, such as thrombospondin and osteopontin, are abundant in lesions and have the potential to act through αVβ3 to alter the smooth muscle cell phenotype and responsiveness (37Liaw L. Skinner M.D. Raines E.W. Ross R. Cheresh D.A. Schwartz S.M. Giachelli C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 713-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Giachelli C.M. Bae N. Amedia M. Denhardt D.T. Alpers C.E. Schwartz S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1686-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), it will be of interest to determine their effects on IGF-I and IGFBP-5 actions. Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) 1The abbreviations used are: SMC, smooth muscle cell; IGFBP-5, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-5; IGF-I, insulin-like growth factor I; pSMC, porcine vascular smooth muscle cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SM, smooth muscle. 1The abbreviations used are: SMC, smooth muscle cell; IGFBP-5, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-5; IGF-I, insulin-like growth factor I; pSMC, porcine vascular smooth muscle cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SM, smooth muscle. in the media of normal blood vessels are surrounded by a basement membrane that contains type IV collagen and laminin and maintain a differentiated, contractile state characterized by abundant myofilaments and expression of contractile protein isoforms such as α-actin (1Thyberg J. Hedin U. Sjolund M. Palmberg L. Bottger B.A. Artherosclerosis. 1990; 10: 966-990Crossref Scopus (483) Google Scholar). They are quiescent, and the proliferative index is low (1Thyberg J. Hedin U. Sjolund M. Palmberg L. Bottger B.A. Artherosclerosis. 1990; 10: 966-990Crossref Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In contrast, SMCs in the neointima seem to have dedifferentiated. This dedifferentiation includes a marked structural reorganization of the cells, with loss of myofilaments and the formation of an extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum and large Golgi complex (2Ross R. Wight T.N. Strandness E. Thiele B. Am. J. Pathol. 1984; 114: 79-93PubMed Google Scholar, 3Moss P.R.L. Campbell G.C. Wang Z.L. Campbell J.H. Lab. Invest. 1995; 53: 556-562Google Scholar, 4Moss P.R.L. Campbell G.R. Campbell J.H. Artherosclerosis. 1986; 6: 664-669Crossref Google Scholar). Their abundance of smooth muscle α-actin decreases, whereas the expression of nonmuscle β- and γ-actin increases (2Ross R. Wight T.N. Strandness E. Thiele B. Am. J. Pathol. 1984; 114: 79-93PubMed Google Scholar, 3Moss P.R.L. Campbell G.C. Wang Z.L. Campbell J.H. Lab. Invest. 1995; 53: 556-562Google Scholar, 4Moss P.R.L. Campbell G.R. Campbell J.H. Artherosclerosis. 1986; 6: 664-669Crossref Google Scholar). They synthesize increased amounts of fibronectin and deposit it into their extracellular matrix (ECM). This is termed the synthetic phenotype, and these cells have acquired the ability to proliferate, migrate, and synthesize ECM in response to stimulation by growth factors and cytokines (5Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9930) Google Scholar). Additionally, cells in the synthetic phenotype constitutively synthesize peptide growth factors, and they have the ability to replicate in the absence of exogenously added mitogens (1Thyberg J. Hedin U. Sjolund M. Palmberg L. Bottger B.A. Artherosclerosis. 1990; 10: 966-990Crossref Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Extracellular matrix has been shown to play an important role in the modulation of the SMC phenotype in culture (6Hedin U. Bottger B.A. Forsberg E. Johansson S. Thyberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 109: 307-319Crossref Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Aortic SMCs assume the synthetic phenotype when they are cultured on a fibronectin substratum and will proliferate in response to stimulation by appropriate growth factors. In contrast, if the cells are cultured on laminin and type IV collagen, they will remain in the contractile phenotype. These ECM proteins function by binding to their integrin receptors on the cell surface. Cultured SMCs express the α5β1 and αVβ3 integrins, which bind fibronectin, and the α2β1 integrin, which binds to laminin and several forms of collagen (7Assoian R.K. Marcantonio E.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2436-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The growth and differentiation of SMCs are modulated by a number of peptide growth factors, including the IGFs. SMCs in culture have been shown to synthesize IGF-I, and IGF-I stimulates SMC proliferation in an autocrine fashion (8Clemmons D.R. Circ. Res. 1985; 56: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Bornfeldt K.E. Arnqvist H.L. Norstedt G. J.

In vivo, IGF-I mRNA and immunoreactive IGF-I are detected in atherosclerotic lesions that develop after injury (11Grant M.B. Wargovich T.J. Ellis E.A. Caballer O.S. Mansour M. Pepine C.J. Circulation. 1994; 89: 1511-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and the increase in IGF-I mRNA and immunoreactive peptide after balloon denudation injury precedes an associated increase in SMC proliferation (12Cercek B.

Expression is a marker for the granulocytic lineage and for certain stages of differentiation and is not known to be inducible in mature cells under physiological conditions. Low level of transcription also occurs in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and is greatly activated upon drug-induced granulocytic maturation and by low doses of retinoic acid, in a strictly cell-specific manner (Herwig, S., Su, Q., Ma, Y., and Tempst, P.

We have analyzed a 10-kilobase pair region, upstream of thedefensin-1 cap site, for the presence of control elements, and we describe a minimal promoter (position −83 to +82) required to drive transcription in HL-60 cells in a quasi cell-specific manner. Our data also suggest the presence of negative regulatory elements in the −416/−191 region that may further contribute to cell specificity in a chromosomal context. The basal promoter contains two functionally essential, ETS-like (GGAA core sequence) elements. The proximal site (−22/−19) constitutively binds the PU.1 transcription factor in vitro and could function, together perhaps with an adjacent TA-rich sequence (−32/−25), in assembly of a myeloid-restricted, basal transcription factor complex. The distal site (−62/−59) interacts in vitro with an unidentified activity, distinct from PU.1, ETS-1, PEA3, and ELK-1 (factors with definite binding site similarities), and is greatly stimulated by phosphorylation during granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells.

Neutrophils are specialized scavenger blood cells, killing microorganisms through a combination of reactive oxidants and polypeptide antibiotics (1Thomas E.L. Lehrer R.I. Rest R.F. Rev. Infect.

HL-60 cells can be chemically induced to mature along various pathways, thus providing a model system for study of differentiation-specific gene regulation (26Koeffler H.P.

Blood. 1991; 77: 909-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, in the course of retinoic acid (RA) treatment, defensintranscription reaches peak levels during the resultant myelocyte and very early metamyelocyte stages of the granulocytic pathway, later followed by a complete down-regulation (25Herwig S. Su Q. Zhang W. Ma Y. Tempst P. Blood. 1996; 87: 350-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, instant down-regulation to virtually undetectable levels was observed during phorbol ester-promoted differentiation toward macrophages (25Herwig S. Su Q. Zhang W. Ma Y. Tempst P. Blood. 1996; 87: 350-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, defensin transcripts have never been found in either myeloblastic (KG-1), monoblastic (U-937), myeloblastic/erythroblastic (K-562), B-lymphoid or T-lymphoid cell lines, not even after extensive RA treatment (10Daher K.A.

Any studies aimed at understanding this unique granulocytic expression ofdefensin genes must converge, eventually, at the identification of genomic regulatory elements and their cognate transactivating factors.Considerable efforts have been expended already at analyzing the control regions of other myeloid-specific genes (29Orkin S.H.

Not surprisingly then, lineage-specific gene activation is controlled, in many cases, through unique combinations (30Friedman A.D. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Furthermore, C/EBPβ and PU.1 are activated, or have their transactivating potential enhanced, by phosphorylation, which may impart an additional layer of cell specificity (46Trautwein C.

Science. 1993; 259: 1622-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Alternative scenarios of myeloid-specific gene activation have ubiquitous factors (e.g. CP1) drive transcription only when promoters are not occupied by repressor proteins (e.g. CDP); here, lineage/stage-specific derepression is the real switch to expression (e.g. in case of gp91-phox) (49Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the published data, it is quite possible that defensin transcription in HL-60 cells is also controlled by one or more of the aforementioned transcription factors and repressors. However, inspection of the 1.2-kb upstream sequence and of the first intron of the HNP defensin-1 gene (taken from Ref. 50Linzmeier R. Michaelson D. Liu L. Ganz T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) did not reveal a presence of the precise binding sites, as previously characterized for these particular factors; neither could RA response elements (51Pfahl M. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) be identified. Thus, there is no easy way to formulate a mechanistic model for promyelocytic defensin expression at this time. Regulatory elements, and their binding factors, will have to be uncovered and characterized without any preconception of identity.Here, we describe a minimal defensin-1 promoter, required to drive transcription in HL-60 cells in a quasi cell-specific manner, that contains two essential, ETS-like elements, one binding the PU.1 transcription factor and the other binding a RA-stimulated activityin vitro.DISCUSSIONCell differentiation involves the orderly expression of numerous genes. Among the transcription factors involved are those governing differentiation itself and others regulating promoters of genes specific for the functions of mature cells. Defensin antibiotics are such key components in neutrophils. In fact, human HNP-type defensins are found exclusively in these cells. Contrary to the insect immune system (65Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.-M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar), HNP defensin synthesis is not noticeably induced by microbial challenge but, instead, occurs in maturing bone marrow cells. Its expression is therefore uniquely restricted; it is a genuine marker for neutrophilic lineage and for differentiation stage. As acute myelogenous leukemia cells derive from a block in differentiation, they provide a freeze-frame to analyze molecular events at a given stage. Low level defensin transcription occurs in HL-60 promyelocytic cells but is greatly activated upon (i) drug-induced granulocytic differentiation and (ii) treatment with retinoic acid at doses too low to bring about morphological changes (25Herwig S. Su Q. Zhang W. Ma Y. Tempst P. Blood. 1996; 87: 350-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The underlying molecular mechanisms of the basal expression and of the activation processes are unknown. Thus, we sought to analyze the molecular control of defensin transcription and how it is affected by chemotherapeutic drugs. This information may also provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of promyelocytic leukemia and may lead to a better mechanistic understanding of chemotherapeutic interventions as well.Here, we show the capacity of extended defensin-1 promoter regions, located at −552/+82, to drive gene expression in vivo in a quasi cell-specific manner; promoter activity in promyelocytic (HL-60) cells is 5–30-fold higher than in related monoblastic (U-937) and, respectively, myeloblastic (KG-1) cell lines. Truncation from position −552 onward to a minimal promoter, located at −83/+82, results in enhanced transcriptional activity in HL-60 cells and even more so in other cells, suggesting deletion of negative regulatory elements that may contribute to cell-specific expression in a regular chromosomal context. The existence of possible repressors binding to those elements was not studied further here. Instead, we provide data that demonstrate the presence (and near location) of two positive regulatory elements within the 83-base pair minimal region required for defensin-1 expression in HL-60 cells. Functional significance is implicit from the fact that disruption of the proximal or distal sites results in, respectively, a 5- or 10-fold loss of basal promoter activity; more than that, the double knock-out entirely abolishes all function.The proximal control element contains a TA-rich sequence TTTAAATA (−32/−25) that, by established criteria of weighted consensus sequence and location (54Bucher P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar), fulfills all requirements of a vertebrate “TATA box.” A trinucleotide mutation (TTTCTAGA), created within this limited sequence, had a profound negative effect on minimal (−83/+82) promoter activity in promyelocytic cells, consistent with the predicted functional role. However, an oligonucleotide containing a bona fide TATA box sequence failed to compete for binding of HL-60 nuclear proteins to an EMSA probe comprising this TA-rich regulatory sequence (“TA probe”; −39/−10), raising doubts about the precise role indefensin-1 expression. Two sets of complexes formed with proteins from HL-60 and U-937 cells. The faster migrating “ladder” complex almost certainly contains transcription factor PU.1, binding to the GGAA core sequence (−22/−19) just downstream from the TA site; its banding pattern in mature myeloid cells is the result of differential phosphorylation or represents degradation products (69Carey J.O. Posekany K.J. deVente J.E. Pettit G.R. Ways D.K. Blood. 1996; 87: 4316-4324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since PU.1 expression is limited to myeloid and B-cells (31Zhang D.E. Hohaus S. Voso M.T.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1549-1560PubMed Google Scholar), it explains the absence of this complex from HeLa cells; early myeloid KG-1 cells could be either too immature to express PU.1 or may have other disregulated expression or activity, perhaps a reason for failure to differentiate (68Olson M.C. Scott E.W. Hack A.A. Su G.H. Tenen D.G. Singh H. Simon M.C. Immunity. 1995; 3: 703-714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The PU.1-binding site is functionally active as well, since its disruption resulted in reduced promoter efficacy in vivo. It appears therefore thatdefensin-1 is yet another myeloid gene target regulated, at least in part, by PU.1 (31Zhang D.E. Hohaus S. Voso M.T. Chen H.M. Smith L.T. Hetherington C.J. Tenen D.G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 211: 137-147PubMed Google Scholar). This brings into perspective the possibility that defensin-1 could indeed have a TATA-less myeloid promoter, relying instead on the proven capacity of nearby bound PU.1, and possible associated proteins, to tether TBP and TFIID and assemble a basal transcription factor complex within reasonable distance from the cap site (70Hagemeier C. Bannister A.J. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 71Eichbaum Q.G. Iyer R. Raveh D.P. Mathieu C. Ezekowitz R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1985-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). If indeed the case, it still cannot alone account for granulocytic specificity ofdefensin-1 expression.Additional control is most likely exerted by a more distal element, also containing the ETS family GGAA signature binding site (−62/−59; see Fig. 2). A mere switch of the sequence within this tetranucleotide (to AAGG) caused a substantial loss of minimal (−83/+82) promoter activity in vivo, the same reduction, in fact, that resulted from truncating the 5′-end by 53 bp (to −30/+82) and arguing for major functional significance. We have termed this distal positive regulatory site REDE (regulatory element ofdefensin expression). A minor EMSA complex formed with an REDE-containing oligonucleotide (D1 or REDE probe) but markedly gained in intensity after HL-60 cells had been treated with RA or HMBA for at least 2 days, indicating differentiation stimulated binding activity, largely the result of phosphorylation. The GG ↔ AA nucleotide exchange, when introduced into this probe, abrogated all binding of HL-60 nuclear protein in vitro. A second, faster migrating band was sometimes observed and may represent the unphosphorylated (or underphosphorylated) form of the major REDE binding activity. The phosphorylation-dependent interaction with specific nucleic acid sequences has broader implications for possible factor identity since several ETS family members require RAS-dependent phosphorylation to reach optimal transactivation potential (72Yang B.-S. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Van Beveren C. Stacey K.J. Hume D.A. Maki R.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 73Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), whereas others are negatively regulated in this manner (74Rabault B. Ghysdael J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28143-28151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 75Hodge D.R. Robinson L. Watson D. Lautenberger J. Zhang X.K. Venanzoni M. Seth A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar). Our data convincingly rule out that either PU.1 or ETS-1 interact with the wild type REDE probe, and we speculate, on theoretical grounds, that ELK-1 is absent from the complex as well. Indeed, no serum response element can be located within reasonable distance from REDE, suggesting that if ELK-1 binds to REDE it must do so autonomously and not in its typical capacity of ternary complex factor (59Treisman R. Marais R. Wynne J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4631-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 64Pellegrini L. Tan S. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 76Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar).This leaves two key questions: (i) what is the precise identity of this activity, and (ii) how does it get stimulated during granulocytic differentiation? Although the first question can be approached experimentally by analysis of all known ETS family members for REDE binding and for abilities to drive transcription of reporter constructs in non-myeloid cells (after co-ectopic expression), a more direct and unbiased way is by purification and structural chemical analysis. Until then, we will refer to this activity as IRD (increasedREDE binding during differentiation). We know for sure that IRD is different from the protein incorporated in the low mobility EMSA complex that forms with the proximal TA probe, for that band is obtained with extracts from untreated HL-60 cells and cannot be competed with an excess of cold REDE probe. Nuclear proteins from one lymphoid and a few myeloid cell lines formed identical complexes with the same REDE probe in the absence of drug treatment; exposure to RA did not significantly alter those patterns. For lack of IRD-specific reagents, we cannot yet determine whether the same activity is constitutively present in all those cells. However, several lines of evidence indicate that this may actually not be the case. Contrary to the heretofore implicated HL-60 nuclear phosphoproteins, binding activities from the other cells could not be readily eliminated by phosphatase treatments. Furthermore, various band shift patterns resulting from point mutational analyses of the REDE probe indicated subtle differences in preferred nucleic acid-binding sites between proteins from myelocytic and other cells. Assuming that IRD has transactivating ability in HL-60 cells, it could be that those REDE-binding proteins from other cell types are inactive forms of IRD, for reasons of differential modifications and/or conformational changes (not affecting DNA binding). Alternatively, repressors recognizing the REDE sequence may bind to the probe in vitro and perhaps antagonize putative activity of IRD in vivo by occupying the recognition site in the defensin promoter. In previous reports, ETS repressor factors have already been shown to specifically suppress ETS transcription factor associated activities (77Sgouras D.N. Athansiou M.A. Beal G.J. Fisher R.J. Blair D.G. Mavrothalassites G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4781-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Yet another possibility is the in vivo incorporation of a suppressor into a bigger complex, also containing bona fide IRD, that might prove unstable during gel shift analysis. And finally, a functional IRD-REDE combination may still fail to drive transcription without a requisite co-regulator, most likely PU.1, bound to the proximal regulatory site, an argument applicable to KG-1 cells for instance.Regarding defensin and IRD induction by RA or HMBA in promyelocytes, we established a direct correlation over a 3-day period between (i) transcriptional rates and steady state mRNA levelsin vivo (25Herwig S. Su Q. Zhang W. Ma Y. Tempst P"
https://openalex.org/W1965747222,"Recent studies demonstrate that cAMP levels are tightly controlled during demyelination and remyelination in Schwann cells as cAMP decreases to 8–10% of normal following both sciatic nerve crush or permanent transection injury and only begins to increase in the crushed nerve after remyelination (Poduslo, J. F., Walikonis, R. S., Domec, M., Berg, C. T., and Holtz-Heppelmann, C. J. (1995) J. Neurochem. 65, 149–159). To investigate the mechanisms responsible for this change in cAMP levels, cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) and adenylyl cyclase activities were determined before and after sciatic nerve injury. Basal cAMP PDE activity in soluble endoneurial homogenates of normal nerve was 34.9 ± 1.9 pmol/mg of protein/min (x¯ ± S.E.; n = 10). This activity increased about 3-fold within 6 days following both injuries. Basal PDE activity remained elevated in the transected nerve, but declined to 70 pmol/mg of protein/min in the crushed nerve at 21 and 35 days following injury. Isozyme-specific inhibitors and stimulators were used to identify the PDE families in the sciatic nerve. The lowKm cAMP-specific (PDE4) and the Ca2+/calmodulin-stimulated (PDE1) families were found to predominate in assays using endoneurial homogenates. The PDE4 inhibitor rolipram also increased cAMP levels significantly after incubation of endoneurial tissue with various isozyme-specific inhibitors, indicating that PDE4 plays a major role in determining cAMP levels. PDE4 mRNA was localized by in situ hybridization to cells identified as Schwann cells by colabeling of S100, a Schwann cell specific protein. Adenylyl cyclase activity declined following injury, from 3.7 pmol/mg of protein/min in normal nerve to 0.70 pmol/mg/min by 7 days following injury. Both decreased synthesis and increased degradation contribute, therefore, to the reduced levels of cAMP following peripheral nerve injury and are likely critical to the process of Wallerian degeneration. Recent studies demonstrate that cAMP levels are tightly controlled during demyelination and remyelination in Schwann cells as cAMP decreases to 8–10% of normal following both sciatic nerve crush or permanent transection injury and only begins to increase in the crushed nerve after remyelination (Poduslo, J.

The maintenance of the myelin-forming phenotype is dependent on the continued contact between the axon and SCs, as any interruption of this association leads to a reversion of Schwann cells from a myelinating to a nonmyelinating phenotype.

Cyclic AMP elevation can at least partially mimic the presence of the axon on cultured nonmyelinating SCs. In these studies, embryonic or neonatal Schwann cells are isolated and expanded in vitro by the addition of forskolin, a stimulator of adenylyl cyclase (29Seamon K.B. Padgett W. Daly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3363-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar, 30Seamon K.B. Daly J.W. Adv.

Biol. 1981; 95: 215-230PubMed Google Scholar). When these mitogens are removed and the Schwann cells re-exposed to forskolin, they re-express low levels of myelin genes (15Lemke G. Chao M. Development. 1988; 102: 499-504PubMed Google Scholar, 32Morgan L. Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. J.

Development. 1990; 109: 105-116PubMed Google Scholar), and display a more mature, flattened phenotype (32Morgan L. Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Studies relating cAMP content to myelination have been conducted by our laboratory using the in vivo models of crush and permanent transection injury of the rat sciatic nerve. In these models, the injury leads to degeneration of axons in the distal segment of the nerve. The loss of axonal contact with SCs leads to demyelination. In the permanently transected nerve, axonal regrowth is prevented, and Schwann cells remain in a nonmyelinating state. Following crush injury, degeneration and demyelination occur as in the transected nerve, but axons are allowed to regrow and are subsequently remyelinated. Cyclic AMP content was measured at various time points following both injuries and compared with myelin gene expression (37Poduslo J.F. Walikonis R.S. Domec M. Berg C.T. Holtz-Heppelmann C.J. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The levels dropped to 10% of normal by 3 days following both injuries, concurrently with the decrease in P0 gene expression, and remained very low in the nonmyelinating transected nerve through 35 days after injury. In the crushed nerve, cAMP levels did increase again starting at about 21 days after injury, but reached only 27% of normal by 35 days after injury, well after P0 re-expression in the crushed nerve, which was 60% of normal expression by 14 days and 100% of normal by 21 days following injury. Remyelination, therefore, seems to precede cAMP recovery and suggests that cAMP may not play a large role in inducing the process of myelination in the peripheral nerve. The importance of cAMP in inducing myelin transcripts in endoneurial segments was further tested using agents that elevate cAMP. Forskolin alone increased cAMP significantly in the normal nerve and in the regenerating crushed nerve, but failed to increase levels in the transected nerve. Cyclic AMP could only be elevated in the transected nerve by treatment with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a general inhibitor of phosphodiesterases (PDEs), as well as with forskolin (37Poduslo J.F. Walikonis R.S. Domec M. Berg C.T. Holtz-Heppelmann C.J. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This indicates that PDE inhibition is necessary to elevate cAMP levels in nonmyelinating endoneurium following injury and suggests that PDEs may play an important role in inactivating this second messenger when Schwann cells are nonmyelinating. Treatment of endoneurial explants from normal, crush, and transection injured nerves with these cAMP elevating agents failed to increase myelin gene expression, further confirming the insufficiency of this messenger in inducing myelin gene expression in vivo (37Poduslo J.F. Walikonis R.S. Domec M. Berg C.T. Holtz-Heppelmann C.J. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies by Suter et al. (38Suter U. Snipes G.J. Schoener-Scott R. Welcher A.A. Pareek S. Lupski J.R. Murphy R.A. Shooter E.M. Patel P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25795-25808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have identified two promoters on the peripheral myelin protein-22 gene. Promoter 1 is primarily activein vivo for peripheral myelin protein-22. A TCAG sequence is found near the peripheral myelin protein-22 transcription initiation site under the control of promoter 1. The same sequence is found at transcription initiation sites in other myelin genes, such as the P0 gene (25Lemke G. Lamar E. Patterson J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 73-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), myelin basic protein gene (39Gow A. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Lazzarini R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and proteolipid protein gene (40Macklin W.B. Campagnoni C.W. Deininger P.L. Gardinier M.V. J. Neurosci. Res. 1987; 18: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), which suggests a common control mechanism. A second promoter controlling peripheral myelin protein-22 expression is preferentially activated in cultured SCs in response to forskolin, and thus the control of myelin gene expression in cultured SCs may not mimic the control mechanisms in vivo, and may confirm our data that cAMP is not sufficient for myelin gene expression in the nerve. Our previous study indicated that cAMP levels change dramatically following injury. Cyclic AMP levels primarily reflect the net balance between synthesis and degradation of this messenger. The present study quantifies adenylyl cyclase (AC) specific activity before and after injury to assess how changes in cAMP synthesis contribute to the changing levels of this second messenger. ATP was quantified in normal and injured nerves to determine whether changes in the concentration of the AC substrate could alter cAMP levels. In addition, an increase in PDE activity may wholly or partially be responsible for the declining cAMP levels found during Wallerian degeneration, as PDE inhibition was required to elevate cAMP following injury. The changes in PDE activity following injury were measured, and the specific isozymes present in normal sciatic endoneurium and those that were up-regulated following injury were identified. Finally, in situ hybridization with a PDE4-specific probe was performed to demonstrate the expression of this enzyme by Schwann cells. Animal surgery was conducted on male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–225 g) under deep pentobarbital anesthesia. The sciatic nerves were exposed and injured just below the sciatic notch, either by crushing for 5 s with smooth forceps or by permanent transection with the ligated ends reflected 180° and sutured to adjacent muscle to prevent axonal reentry (12Poduslo J.F. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The distal segment was removed at various time points following injury and the epineurium and perineurium, which consist largely of fibers of connective tissue and epithelial cells, were removed by the microdissection technique of Dyck et al. (41Dyck P.J. Ellefson R.D. Lais A.C. Smith R.C. Taylor W.F. Van Dyke R.A. Mayo Clin. Proc. 1970; 45: 286-327PubMed Google Scholar). This technique allows exclusive study of the endoneurium, which consists of the neural elements (axons, Schwann cells, and myelin) and supporting connective tissue. All animal use procedures were in strict accordance with the NIH “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” and were approved by the Mayo Animal Care and Use Committee. PDE activities were determined by measuring the degradation of [3H]cAMP in a two-step procedure (42Kincaid R.L. Manganiello V.C. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 43Thompson W.J. Brooker G. Appleman M.M.

Pharmacol. 1980; 311: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Isolated endoneurium from normal or injured nerve was homogenized in 20 mm TES, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 μm leupeptin, 0.1 μm pepstatin, 0.1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (45Yamaki M. McIntyre S. Rassier M.E. Schwartz J.H. Dousa T.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: 957-964PubMed Google Scholar). In studies measuring Ca2+/CaM stimulated activity, the buffer included complete protease inhibitor mixture without EDTA (Boehringer Mannheim), supplemented with 0.1 μm leupeptin and 0.1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, as we found this family of PDEs extremely sensitive to proteolysis. The homogenate was spun at 198,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant and the pellet were separated. The pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer and the protein concentrations of both the supernatant and pellet were measured using a Pierce bicinchoninic acid protein assay (46Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Basal PDE activity was measured by adding 2.5 μg of protein in 10 μl of homogenization buffer to 100 μl of incubation mixture (containing 50 mm TES buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgSO4, and 0.5 μm total cAMP, with 2.5 pmol of thin layer chromatography purified [3H]cAMP) (42Kincaid R.L. Manganiello V.C. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and incubated at 30 °C for 7.5 min. In experiments examining the presence of specific PDE 2In this paper, the PDE isozymes are classified according to the system proposed by Beavo (52Beavo J.A. Reifsnyder D.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 150-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 84Beavo J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1988; 22: 1-38PubMed Google Scholar). In this system, PDE1 refers to the family of PDE isozymes whose activity is dependent on Ca2+ and calmodulin; PDE2 is the family stimulated by micromolar concentrations of cGMP; PDE3 are isozymes with lowKm for cAMP and are inhibited by cilostamide and cGMP but not inhibited by rolipram; PDE4 are isozymes with high affinity and selectivity for cAMP and are inhibited selectively by rolipram. isozymes, various PDE type-specific inhibitors and activators were included in the incubation mixture and compared with the basal activity of matched samples without these diagnostic agents. In testing for the presence of the Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent PDEs (PDE1), the incubation mixture also contained 10 μg/ml CaM and 2.01 mm CaCl2, to obtain 10 μm free Ca2+ based on the chelation constant for EGTA (47Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. 1968; 64: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Matching samples containing Ca2+/CaM as well as 10 μm Type I-specific PDE inhibitor 8-methoxymethyl-1-methyl-3-(2-methylpropyl)-xanthine (8-MeoM-IBMX) (Biomol Research Laboratories) were also tested. The presence of cGMP-stimulated PDEs (PDE2) was tested by including 5 μmcGMP in the incubation mixture (48Martins T.J. Mumby M.C. Beavo J.A. J. Biol.

Acta. 1988; 972: 79-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) along with 10 μm8-MeoM-IBMX and 3 μm cilostamide (N-cyclohexyl-N-methyl-4(1,2-dihydro-2-oxo-6-quinohyloxy)butyramide; a kind gift from Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, Osaka, Japan). The contribution of the cGMP-inhibited isozyme toward total PDE activity was measured by including 3 μm cilostamide (52Beavo J.A. Reifsnyder D.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 150-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 53Hidaka H. Endo T. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylation Res. 1984; 16: 245-259PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the activity of the low Km cAMP-specific isozyme was determined by the addition of 3 μm rolipram (4-(3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methylphenyl)-2-pyrolidone; a gift from Smith Kline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King-of-Prussia, PA) (52Beavo J.A.

Cell Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or 3 μm denbufylline. Following incubation, the samples were quickly frozen in a dry ice and acetone slurry to stop the reaction. Fifty μl of PDE buffer (50 mm TES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA) was added, and the samples boiled at 95 °C for 90 s to inactivate the PDEs. Upon cooling, 50 μl of 1 mg/ml snake venom (Ophiophagus hannah) was added, and the mixture incubated for 30 min to convert the nucleotides to nucleosides. One ml of cold carrier (containing 0.1m each of adenosine, adenine, hypoxanthine, and inosine) was added, and the samples were added to QAE-Sephadex A-25 columns. The [3H]adenosine was eluted with 20 mm ammonium formate. The eluate was counted in a scintillation counter, and the counts converted to picomoles of cAMP hydrolyzed/mg of protein/min. Hydrolysis was kept to less than 10% of the substrate and linearly proportional to incubation time and enzyme protein. PDE assays were conducted on the supernatant and the 198,000 ×g pellet from normal endoneurium and at various times following injury. The homogenization buffer contained 0.1% Triton X-100 to promote solubilization of PDEs (55Takeda S. Lin C.T. Morgano P.G. McIntyre S.J. Dousa T.P. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), so most activity should be localized to the soluble fraction. Activity in the pellet from normal endoneurium was 27% of total normal PDE activity, falling to just 20% of total activity by 35 days after crush injury and 7% of total activity at 35 days following transection. Thus the majority of PDE activity was found in the soluble fraction. Preliminary studies found no isozyme uniquely located to the pellet, so further studies on the endoneurial PDE isozymes were conducted solely on the soluble fraction. The distal segments of normal, and crushed or transected nerves 21 days following injury were removed, desheathed, and minced into 2–3-mm slices. The slices were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a Krebs-Ringers II solution (110 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 1.4 mm MgSO4, 4 mmNaHCO3, 12.8 mm glucose, 12.6 mmNa2HPO4, and 3.1 mmNaH2PO4) containing 30 μmrolipram, cilostamide, or 8-MeoM-IBMX and with or without 100 μm forskolin (Calbiochem). Following incubation, the slices were homogenized in 400 μl of cold 4 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. Aliquots were removed for DNA quantification. The remaining homogenate was boiled for 3 min and the precipitated proteins centrifuged at 15,800 × g for 5 min in a refrigerated Eppendorf microfuge. The supernatant was collected and assayed for cAMP using a kit from Amersham. Fifty μl of [3H]cAMP (0.025 μCi: 0.9 pmol) was added to 50 μl of supernatant, followed by 100 μl of cAMP-binding protein dissolved to the manufacturer's specifications. The tubes were vortexed and kept on ice for 2 h. One-hundred μl of suspended charcoal was then added to adsorb any unbound cAMP. The tubes were centrifuged to pellet the charcoal, and 200 μl of this supernatant was removed and placed into scintillation vials for counting. The counts were compared with a standard curve constructed with known amounts of unlabeled cAMP, and the results expressed as picomole of cAMP/μg of DNA. First strand cDNA was synthesized from sciatic nerve total RNA with random hexanucleotide primers using a cDNA synthesis kit (Boehringer Mannheim) following the manufacturers directions. Polymerase chain reaction was performed in a 50-μl volume containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin, and 0.25 mm deoxynucleotides, 1 unitTaq polymerase, and 100 ng of cDNA. One μmrat PDE4/4B-specific primers (sense, 5′-GGCTGGGTACTCCCATAATCGG-3′; antisense, 5′-GTAGAGAGGAGAACGTGGCGTTG-3′) complementary to bases 1090–1111 (sense) and 1275–1296 (antisense) (56Swinnen J.V. Joseph D.R. Conti M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8197-8201Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) were added. This region is located near the beginning of the conserved catalytic region and avoids the alternatively spliced regions near the 5′ end. The PDE4 isogenes are approximately 70% identical in this region (57Bolger G.B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Other PDE families have a much lower homology in this region. Preliminary polymerase chain reaction studies amplifying this region using primers specific for PDE4D were not successful. The polymerase chain reaction product of PDE4B was thus used for in situ hybridization. The polymerase chain reactions were performed for 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 25 cycles. The amplified product was ligated into pCRII plasmids (Invitrogen) and transformed into INVaF cells. Plasmids from individual colonies were isolated by miniprep (Qiagen) and sequenced. Digoxygenin-labeled probes were created by SP6 (antisense) and T7 (sense) run-off transcription using a Boehringer Mannheim kit. Labeling efficiency was verified by dot-blot analysis of serially diluted labeled transcripts. Dilutions giving equivalent signals for sense and antisense were used for in situ probing of sciatic nerve sections. In situ hybridization was conducted on sections of normal and 4-day transected sciatic nerves. Sciatic endoneurial segments were fixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS overnight followed by a PBS wash. The tissue was dehydrated in a series of baths of increasing ethanol concentrations followed by a xylene wash. The dehydrated tissue was embedded in paraffin, sectioned in 5-μm sections, starting approximately 1 cm from the injury site, and baked on slides overnight at 45 °C. The sciatic sections were deparaffinated by washing in xylene for 14 min followed by a series of 4-min EtOH baths of decreasing concentrations (100 to 50%). The sections were then treated with 0.2 n HCl for 20 min followed by water and PBS rinses followed by incubation in 1 μg/μl proteinase K for 30 min at 50 °C. After PBS and 2× SSC washes, the tissues were incubated in 0.1 m triethanolamine with 0.25% acetic anhydride for 10 min. Prehybridization was conducted by incubation in hybridization buffer (containing 2× SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 50% formamide, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA) for 2 h at 45 °C. Hybridization buffer containing diluted digoxygenin-labeled probes was then added. Coverslips were applied and the section incubated for 24 h at 45 °C. The sections were washed in SSC, and blocked in 100 mm Tris-NaCl with 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. The samples were then incubated with anti-digoxygenin antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. Color development in NBT/BCIP for 5 min followed. S100 was localized immunohistochemically in sections previously stained for PDE4 mRNA location. Immunohistochemical steps were used for S100 localization as the antidigoxygenin antibody treatment and color development steps during PDE4 in situ hybridization were not RNase free, and the unhybridized S100 mRNA could become degraded and unsuitable forin situ hybridization. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation of sections of 0.6% H2O2/MeOH for 30 min. Nonspecific binding sites were then blocked by incubation in 20% normal goat serum, PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4. The sections were incubated overnight in S100 primary antibody (Biogenex) diluted 1:15 in 10% normal goat serum/PBS. Following a rinse in PBS, a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody was added and incubated for 1 h. Streptavidin/peroxidase was then added for 1 h, followed by color development in tetrahydrochloride 3,3′-diaminobenzidine in 0.05 m Tris with 0.3% H2O2 for 5–10 min. DNA was quantified by the method of Lipman (58Lipman M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 128-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Two-μl aliquots of sample homogenate were added to 2 ml of assay buffer (containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1.5 μmHoechst Dye number 33258), and the fluorescence measured using a TK-100 fluorometer (Hoefer Scientific Instruments). Calf thymus DNA (Sigma) was used as a standard. The presence of PDE inhibitors was not found to interfere with DNA determination. AC activity"

One of the strategies used in the treatment of cancer attempts to take advantage of drugs that are activated preferentially in the unique environments within solid tumors, minimizing damage to normal tissue. Mitomycin C and porfiromycin (Fig. 1) are prodrugs that can exploit the unique reductive environment in the hypoxic regions of solid tumors, where they are bioactivated to cytotoxic species (1Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Hill B.T. Bellamy A.S. Antitumor Drug-Radiation Interactions. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 125-139Google Scholar). When triggered by enzymatic bioreduction, these compounds form highly reactive intermediates, which likely kill cells by cross-linking genomic DNA (reviewed in Refs. 2Sartorelli A.C. Tomasz M.

This result contradicts two studies utilizing human NAD(P)H dehydrogenase-transfected NIH 3T3 murine cells (9Powis G. Gasdaska P.Y. Gallegos A. Sherrill K. Goodman D. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 1141-1146PubMed Google Scholar) or CHO cells (10Gustafson D.L. Beall H.D. Bolton E.M. Ross D. Waldren C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 728-735PubMed Google Scholar), which suggested that this enzyme does not bioactivate these drugs under aerobic conditions, but agrees with Mikami et al. (11Mikami K. Naito M. Tomida A. Yamada M. Sirakusa T. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2823-2826PubMed Google Scholar) who found a 5–10-fold enhancement in aerobic mitomycin C sensitivity of St-4 gastric carcinoma cells overexpressing transfected human NAD(P)H dehydrogenase. Likewise, a mouse embryonic stem cell line containing a homozygous knockout of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase demonstrated increased aerobic resistance to mitomycin C, suggesting that the mouse enzyme is capable of activating this drug (12Yoshida T. Tsuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Experiments exploring the catalytic differences between the rat and human versions of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase have determined that the rat enzyme reduces mitomycin C 4.5 times faster than the human enzyme (13Beall H.D. Murphy A.M. Siegel D. Hargreaves R.H.J. Butler J. Ross D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 499-504PubMed Google Scholar), and that changing the amino acid at position 104 of the human enzyme from glutamine to a tyrosine residue, which is present in the rat enzyme, can cause the human enzyme to behave kinetically like the rat enzyme (14Chen S. Knox R. Wu K. Deng P.S.-K. Zhou D. Bianchet M.A. Amzel L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1437-1439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Other cellular enzymes involved in the bioreductive activation of the mitomycins include NADH:cytochrome b5 reductase (FpD; EC 1.6.2.2) (15Fisher J. Olsen R. Dev. Biochem. 1982; 21: 240-243Google Scholar, 16Hodnick W.F. Sartorelli A.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4907-4912PubMed Google Scholar), xanthine oxidase (EC 1.1.3.22) (17Bachur N.R. Gordon S.L. Gee M.V. Kon H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 954-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 18Pan S.-S. Andrews P.A. Glover C.J. Bachur N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 959-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and xanthine dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.204) (19Gustafson D.L. Pritsos C.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 1180-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20Gustafson D.L. Pritsos C.A. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6936-6939PubMed Google Scholar, 21Pritsos C.A. Gustafson D.L. Oncol. Res. 1994; 6: 477-481PubMed Google Scholar). Because xanthine oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase are present only at very low levels in tumor tissue, we chose to examine the role of FpD in the bioactivation of the mitomycins in our intact CHO cell system. The expression of the FpD gene involves a combination of transcriptional and translational mechanisms. Two transcripts encoding the three known forms of the rat FpD enzyme are produced from a single gene (22Pietrini G. Carrera P. Borgese N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7246-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Pietrini G. Aggujaro D. Carrera P. Malyszko J. Vitale A. Borgese N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). One transcript produces the myristylated membrane-bound enzyme and is expressed in all tissues. The second transcript, which is produced from an alternate, erythrocyte-specific promoter, encodes a protein which lacks the 7 amino acid myristylation consensus sequence but retains the membrane anchor and an additional 13 noncharged amino acids on the N terminus. A second form of the protein encoded in this transcript produces a soluble isoform which lacks the membrane anchor sequence; this protein is produced through translational initiation at a downstream AUG codon and is the major protein produced from this transcript. In rat liver cells, the myristylated, anchored form of FpD distributes in an approximately equal manner between the endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondrial outer membrane (24Borgese N. Pietrini G. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Borgese N. Aggujaro D. Carrera P. Pietrini G. Bassetti M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1501-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), although the concentration of enzyme measured on either a protein or a phospholipid basis is 11-fold or 4- to 5-fold higher, respectively, in mitochondrial outer membranes than in the endoplasmic reticulum (24Borgese N. Pietrini G. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The higher concentration of FpD on the mitochondrial outer membrane may be partially due to a slower rate of degradation of the mitochondrial form of the enzyme compared with its endoplasmic reticulum localized counterpart (26Borgese N. Pietrini G. Meldolesi J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Studies utilizing a purified rabbit erythrocyte form of FpD have demonstrated that this enzyme can reduce mitomycin C to alkylating species, with greater activation occurring under hypoxia and reduced pH (16Hodnick W.F. Sartorelli A.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4907-4912PubMed Google Scholar). Mitomycin C was contributed by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (Wallingford, CT). Porfiromycin was synthesized from mitomycin C by our laboratory. NADH, NADPH, NAD+, chloroquine, rotenone, and Hepes were purchased from Sigma. Glutamine, hypoxanthine, thymidine, geneticin (G418), trypsin, penicillin, and streptomycin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Tissue culture flasks and 60-, 100-, and 150-mm tissue culture dishes were acquired from Corning Costar Corp. (Cambridge, MA). Dicumarol, potassium ferricyanide, and ethanol were obtained from Aldrich. Mercaptoethanol was from Bio-Rad. Na2HPO4·2H2O, dextrose, CaCl2, glycerol, succinic acid, Tris, EDTA, KH2PO4, KCl, and NaCl were obtained from J. T. Baker. The cell line used in this study is a variant of the CHO-K1 cell line termed CHO-K1/dhfr− (27Urlaub G. Chasin L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4216-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) and was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). This cell line is deficient in dihydrofolate reductase. The cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories Inc., Logan, UT), 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm hypoxanthine, 0.01 mm thymidine, and antibiotics (penicillin, 100 units/ml; streptomycin, 100 μg/ml). Transfected lines were maintained in the identical medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 to provide for selection of the expression vector. Cells were grown as monolayers in tissue culture flasks, Petri dishes, or glass milk dilution bottles at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. The doubling time of CHO-K1/dhfr− cultures is 19 h. The cDNA for the myristylated form of the rat NADH:cytochrome b5 reductase was generously provided by Dr. Nica Borgese of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche at the University of Milan (Milan, Italy) (22Pietrini G. Carrera P. Borgese N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7246-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To allow for the subcloning of the 1348-base pair cDNA into the eukaryotic expression vector pRC/CMV (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA), the cDNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) utilizing the following oligonucleotides: 1, 5′-CGCGGATCCAAGCTTGGTACCGCCACCATGGGGGCCCAGCTG-3′ and 2, 5′-CGCGGATCCAAGCTTGCTAGCCTCTGTCTCTATGTCTGTATCTG-3′. These oligonucleotides incorporate a HindIII restriction site (shown in italics) upstream of the ATG translational initiation codon (shown in bold) and downstream of the termination codon in the 3′-untranslated region (priming from base pairs 1300–1322). To allow for construction of the cytoplasmic form of the reductase, a third oligonucleotide was synthesized: 3, 5′-CGCGGATCCAAGCTTGGTACCGCCACCATGAAGCTGTTTCAGCGCTCC-3′. This oligonucleotide, used in conjunction with oligonucleotide 2 above in a PCR reaction to generate the gene cassette, initiates 70 base pairs within the coding sequence of the reductase gene, resulting in a truncation of 23 amino acids and removal of the membrane binding domain from the amino terminus of the enzyme. The amplified PCR products were extracted with phenol:chloroform, precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol, and resuspended in 50 μl of Tris:EDTA (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). Following digestion of 5 μl of the amplified cDNAs with HindIII (Boehringer Mannheim), the fragments were subcloned into pRC/CMV, and recombinants were screened by restriction analysis to isolate the correct orientation. The plasmids, designated pRC/CMV-FpD (full-length) and pRC/CMV-sol-FpD (truncated), contain the promoter sequences from the immediate early gene of the human cytomegalovirus and the appropriate sequences for polyadenylation and selection (neomycin resistance), and insert stably into the genome of transfected cell lines. Transfections were performed by the Ca3(PO4)2-DNA coprecipitation method essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.32-16.36Google Scholar) and modified by Belcourt et al. (8Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Single colonies were introduced into wells of a 24-well plate using sterile cotton-tipped applicators (General Medical Corp., Richmond, VA). After expansion, the isolates were screened for expression of the NADH:cytochromeb5 reductase cDNA genes. Isolates which had elevated enzyme activities were cloned by flow cytometric single cell sorting, and the resulting clones were rescreened. Vector-transfected control clones were CHO-K1/dhfr− cells transfected with the plasmid without a cDNA insert. Exponentially growing cells (approximately 5 × 106 total cells) were harvested by trypsinization, washed in cell culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum to inactivate the trypsin, washed with phosphate buffered saline (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4), then resuspended in 2 ml of the same buffer. Cells were disrupted by sonication using a Branson sonicator (Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT) with three 10-s bursts at a setting of 25 with 1-min cooling on ice between each sonication burst. Cell disruption was confirmed microscopically. NAD(P)H dehydrogenase activity was measured as the dicumarol-inhibitable reduction of dichlorophenolindophenol, measured at 600 nm with a Beckman model 25 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, CA) using an extinction coefficient of 21 mm−1 cm−1 at 30 °C (29Ernster L. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 309-317Crossref Scopus (697) Google Scholar); the final concentration of dicumarol was 100 μm (30Keyes S.R. Fracasso P.M. Heimbrook D.C. Rockwell S. Sligar S.G. Sartorelli A.C. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 5638-5643PubMed Google Scholar). NADPH:cytochrome c (P-450) reductase and rotenone-insensitive NADH:cytochrome c reductase activities were assayed in cell extracts by monitoring the rate of ferricytochromec reduction at 550 nm (extinction coefficient of 21 mm−1 cm−1) at 30 °C (31Sottocasa G.L. Kuylenstierna B. Ernster L. Bergstrand A. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 32: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar, 32Yasukochi Y. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5337-5344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NADH:cytochrome b5 reductase activity was measured as NADH:ferricyanide reductase at 420 nm (extinction coefficient of 1.02 mm−1 cm−1) at 30 °C essentially as described previously (33Yubisui T. Takeshita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 91: 1467-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but using a final concentration of 0.34 mm NADH. Succinate dehydrogenase activity was measured as the succinate-dependent reduction of dichlorophenolindophenol by a modification of a previously reported method (34King T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 216-225Crossref Scopus (252) Google Scholar) in a 1-ml reaction mixture consisting of 50 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.04 mmdichlorophenolindophenol, 1.5 mm KCN, and 3.3 mm succinic acid at 30 °C. Protein concentrations were assayed using the bicinchoninic protein assay reagent (Pierce) (35Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18346) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing monolayers of CHO-K1/dhfr−, CHO-FpD-9, CHO-sol-FpD-8, and CHO-sol-FpD-12 cells were seeded in glass milk dilution bottles at 2 × 105 cells per bottle and were used in midexponential phase (approximately 3–4 days of growth). Hypoxia was induced by gassing the cultures with a humidified mixture of 95% N2, 5% CO2 (<10 ppm O2) at 37 °C for 2 h through a rubber septum fitted with 13-gauge (inflow) and 18-gauge (outflow) needles. Following induction of hypoxia, cells were exposed to 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, or 30 μm mitomycin C or porfiromycin for 1 h; drugs were injected through the septum without compromising the hypoxia. Cells under aerobic conditions were treated with the mitomycins in an identical manner for 1 h in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Treated cells were washed, harvested by trypsinization, and assayed for survival by measuring their ability to form macroscopic colonies (36Rockwell S. Lab. Anim. Sci. 1977; 27: 831-851PubMed Google Scholar). Both aerobic and hypoxic vehicle controls (70% ethanol) were included in each experiment; the surviving fractions were normalized using these vehicle controls. The plating efficiencies (colonies/100 plated cells; means ± standard deviations) for CHO-K1/dhfr−, CHO-FpD-9, CHO-sol-FpD-8, and CHO-sol-FpD-12 cells were 84 ± 7, 70 ± 4, 55 ± 2, and 52 ± 3, respectively. The surviving fractions for the aerobic vehicle-treated controls (means ± S.D.) were 1.01 ± 0.04, 0.99 ± 0.02, 1.00 ± 0.02, and 1.00 ± 0.03, while the surviving fractions for the hypoxic vehicle-treated controls were somewhat lower, reflecting the toxic effects of the hypoxia: 0.67 ± 0.06, 0.59 ± 0.02, 0.47 ± 0.01, and 0.53 ± 0.03 for CHO-K1/dhfr−, CHO-FpD-9, CHO-sol-FpD-8, and CHO-sol-FpD-12 cells, respectively. Exponentially growing CHO-K1/dhfr− parental, CHO-FpD-9, and CHO-sol-FpD-12 cells were collected and disrupted by sonication as described above, except that cells were resuspended in 20 ml of Hepes buffer (25 mmHepes, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4) at a cell concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml, and sonication was performed at a setting of 20. The cell sonicates were centrifuged at 12,100 ×g for 10 min (mitochondrial/nuclear fraction), then at 105,000 × g for 1 h (microsomal fraction). The resulting supernatant represented the cytosolic fraction. Each pellet was washed in Hepes buffer, recentrifuged, then resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer. Fractions were assayed for NADH:cytochromeb5 reductase and succinate dehydrogenase enzyme activities and protein concentration as described above. Cell sonicates of exponentially growing CHO-K1/dhfr− parental, CHO-FpD-9, and CHO-sol-FpD-12 cells were prepared as detailed above for the assays of enzyme activity. The relative rates of mitomycin C reduction by NADH-supplemented cell sonicates were determined in a reaction mixture containing 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.6), 0.05 mm NADH, 8 μm rotenone, 0.3 mmKCN, 0.1 mm mitomycin C, and 0.2% (v/v) ethanol in a final volume of 2 ml. The velocity of mitomycin C reduction was expressed as the disappearance of mitomycin C (quinone moiety) measured at 375 nm (extinction coefficient of 13.2 mm−1cm−1) at 30 °C under hypoxia. Hypoxia was accomplished by stoppering an anaerobic cuvette (Quaracell Products, Inc., Baldwin, NY) with a rubber septum fitted with 18-gauge (inflow) and 26-gauge (outflow) needles and pregassing the reaction mixture for 10 min with humidified nitrogen. Mitomycin C was injected through the septum without interrupting the hypoxia. Our in vitro studies using purified FpD indicated that this enzyme can bioreductively activate mitomycin C (16Hodnick W.F. Sartorelli A.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4907-4912PubMed Google Scholar). After transfection of an expression vector containing a cDNA encoding the full length, myristylated, membrane-bound form of the rat FpD enzyme into CHO-K1/dhfr− cells, clones overexpressing FpD enzyme activity were selected. One such clone, CHO-FpD-9, overexpressed FpD activity by approximately 9-fold (TableI). To rule out changes in the other oxidoreductases implicated in the bioreductive activation of the mitomycins, including NADPH:cytochrome c (P-450) reductase and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, these enzyme activities were also measured in the transfected cell line and compared with the activities in the nontransfected parental cell line. No changes were observed in the other oxidoreductases, indicating that, of the known mitomycin bioactivating enzymes, only the expression level of FpD was changed (Table I). The CHO-K1/dhfr− cell line expresses no xanthine oxidase or xanthine dehydrogenase enzyme activity (7Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Open table in a new tab The subcellular localization of FpD was examined in the nontransfected parental line, CHO-K1/dhfr−, and the FpD-transfected cell line, CHO-FpD-9, by assaying subcellular fractions for FpD enzyme activity. The majority of the FpD activity in CHO-K1/dhfr−cells co-localized with the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase, indicating that FpD is found predominantly in the mitochondria of this CHO cell line, with a significant but smaller fraction localized in the microsomes (TableII). This is consistent with the distribution patterns of this enzyme observed in rat liver cells (37Borgese N. D'Arrigo A. De Silvestris M. Pietrini G. Subcell. Biochem. 1993; 21: 313-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In CHO-FpD-9 cells, the distribution pattern of FpD activity was similar to that of parental cells, with most of the enzyme activity residing in the mitochondrial fraction (Table II).Table IISubcellular distribution of NADH:cytochrome b5 reductase and succinate dehydrogenase enzyme activities in CHO-K1/dhfr−, CHO-Fpd-9, and CHO-sol-Fpd-12 cellsSubcellular fraction2-2001Subcellular fractions were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Activity2-bEnzyme activities were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The percent enzyme activities were calculated as the activity in a particular fraction divided by the sum of the activities in all of the fractions.NADH:cytochrome b5reductase2-2003Values represent an average of duplicate experiments.Succinate dehydrogenaseCHO-K1/dhfr−CHO-Fpd-9CHO-sol-Fpd-12CHO-K1/dhfr−CHO-Fpd-9CHO-sol-Fpd-12%Mitochondrial/nuclear656426776790Microsomal313312141910Cytoplasmic436291402-2001 Subcellular fractions were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.”2-b Enzyme activities were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The percent enzyme activities were calculated as the activity in a particular fraction divided by the sum of the activities in all of the fractions.2-2003 Values represent an average of duplicate experiments. Open table in a new tab The effect of increasing FpD enzyme activity in the CHO-FpD-9 cell line on the sensitivity of these cells to mitomycin C and porfiromycin was measured under aerobic and hypoxic conditions using a clonogenic assay. Parental cells showed similar sensitivities to mitomycin C under aerobic and hypoxic conditions, with a small but significant difference in sensitivity at 10 μm mitomycin C (Fig. 2 A). This is a change from what we previously reported for this cell line (7Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Rockwell S. Sartorelli A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), where we initially noted little or no difference in mitomycin C sensitivity at this drug concentration under aerobic and hypoxic conditions. The acquisition of additional data on the aerobic/hypoxic drug sensitivities of this cell line is thought to account for the change from the insignificant difference reported previously to the small, but significant, difference reported here. In contrast, porfiromycin was markedly more cytotoxic to the CHO-K1/dhfr− parental cell line under hypoxia, with relatively little aerobic drug toxicity at concentrations as high as 30 μm (Fig. 2 B). Porfiromycin has been reported to be much less cytotoxic than mitomycin C to aerobic cells but essentially equivalent on a molar basis to mitomycin C in cryptotoxicity to hypoxic EMT6 mouse mammary carcinoma cells (reviewed in Sartorelli et al. (38Sartorelli A.C. Belcourt M.F. Hodnick W.F. Keyes S.R. Pritsos C.A. Rockwell S. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1995; 35: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar)). Our finding that porfiromycin is significantly more toxic than mitomycin C under hypoxic conditions is not confined to the CHO-K1/dhfr− cell line, but was also noted in CHO-HA-1 (39Fracasso P.M. Sartorelli A.C. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 3939-3944PubMed Google Scholar) and CHO-AA8 (40Hughes C.S. Irvin C.G. Rockwell S. Cancer Commun. 1991; 3: 29-35PubMed Google Scholar) cells. Under oxygenated conditions, the CHO-FpD-9 cell line was significantly less sensitive to mitomycin C than was the parental cell line despite the fact that CHO-FpD-9 cells expressed approximately 9-fold"
https://openalex.org/W2028503793,"Co-crystallographic studies have shown that the interaction of human prothrombin fragment 2 (F2) with thrombin involves the formation of salt bridges between the kringle inner loop of F2 and anion-binding exosite II of thrombin. When F2 binds to thrombin, it has been shown to evoke conformational changes at the active site and at exosite I of the enzyme. Using plasma, recombinant, and synthetic F2 peptides (F2, rF2, and sF2, respectively) we have further localized the thrombin-binding domain on F2. F2, rF2-(1–116), rF2-(55–116), and sF2-(63–116), all of which contain the kringle inner loop (residues 64–93) and the acidic COOH-terminal connecting peptide (residues 94–116), bind to thrombin-agarose. In contrast, analogues of the kringle inner loop, sF2-(63–90), or the COOH-terminal connecting peptide, sF2-(92–116), do not bind. Thus, contrary to predictions from the crystal structure, the COOH-terminal connecting peptide as well as the kringle inner loop are involved in the interaction of F2 with thrombin. F2 and sF2-(63–116) bind saturably to fluorescently labeled active site-blocked thrombin with Kd values of 4.1 and 51.3 μm, respectively. The affinity of sF2-(63–116) for thrombin increases about 5-fold (Kd = 10 μm) when Val at position 78 is substituted with Glu. F2 and sF2-(63–116) bind to exosite II on thrombin because both reduce the heparin-catalyzed rate of thrombin inhibition by antithrombin ∼4-fold. In contrast, only F2 slows the uncatalyzed rate of thrombin inactivation by antithrombin. Like F2, sF2-(63–116) induces allosteric changes in the active site and exosite I of thrombin because it alters the rates of thrombin-mediated hydrolysis of chromogenic substrates and displaces fluorescently labeled hirudin54–65 from active site-blocked thrombin, respectively. Both peptides also prolong the thrombin clotting time of fibrinogen in a concentration-dependent fashion, reflecting their effects on the active site and/or exosite I. These studies provide further insight into the regions of F2 that evoke functional changes in thrombin. Co-crystallographic studies have shown that the interaction of human prothrombin fragment 2 (F2) with thrombin involves the formation of salt bridges between the kringle inner loop of F2 and anion-binding exosite II of thrombin. When F2 binds to thrombin, it has been shown to evoke conformational changes at the active site and at exosite I of the enzyme.

In contrast, analogues of the kringle inner loop, sF2-(63–90), or the COOH-terminal connecting peptide, sF2-(92–116), do not bind. Thus, contrary to predictions from the crystal structure, the COOH-terminal connecting peptide as well as the kringle inner loop are involved in the interaction of F2 with thrombin. F2 and sF2-(63–116) bind saturably to fluorescently labeled active site-blocked thrombin with Kd values of 4.1 and 51.3 μm, respectively. The affinity of sF2-(63–116) for thrombin increases about 5-fold (Kd = 10 μm) when Val at position 78 is substituted with Glu. F2 and sF2-(63–116) bind to exosite II on thrombin because both reduce the heparin-catalyzed rate of thrombin inhibition by antithrombin ∼4-fold. In contrast, only F2 slows the uncatalyzed rate of thrombin inactivation by antithrombin. Like F2, sF2-(63–116) induces allosteric changes in the active site and exosite I of thrombin because it alters the rates of thrombin-mediated hydrolysis of chromogenic substrates and displaces fluorescently labeled hirudin54–65 from active site-blocked thrombin, respectively. Both peptides also prolong the thrombin clotting time of fibrinogen in a concentration-dependent fashion, reflecting their effects on the active site and/or exosite I. These studies provide further insight into the regions of F2 that evoke functional changes in thrombin. Prothrombin, a 581-amino acid plasma glycoprotein, is converted to the serine protease thrombin in the final stages of the blood coagulation cascade. The proteolytic conversion of prothrombin to thrombin is catalyzed by prothrombinase, an enzyme complex composed of the serine protease factor Xa, the cofactor Va, phospholipids, and calcium (1Hemker H.C.

During this reaction, prothrombin is cleaved into three fragments: fragment 1 (F1) 1The abbreviations used are: F1, prothrombin fragment 1; F2, prothrombin fragment 2; sF2, synthetic F2 peptides; rF2, recombinant F2 peptides; AT, antithrombin; ANS, anilinonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid; FPR,d-phenylalanyl-l-propyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone; FITC, fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate; ATA-FPR,N-((acetylthio)acetyl)-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: F1, prothrombin fragment 1; F2, prothrombin fragment 2; sF2, synthetic F2 peptides; rF2, recombinant F2 peptides; AT, antithrombin; ANS, anilinonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid; FPR,d-phenylalanyl-l-propyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone; FITC, fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate; ATA-FPR,N-((acetylthio)acetyl)-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.(consisting of a γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain and the kringle 1 domain), fragment 2 (F2) (consisting of the kringle 2 domain), and the catalytic domain (3Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 123-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The Gla domain of F1 facilitates calcium-dependent binding of the proenzyme to phospholipid surfaces (4Soriano-Garcia M. Padmanabhan K. de Vos A.M. Tulinsky A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2554-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Although the F2 domain has been shown to interact with factor Va (5Bajaj S.P. Butkowski R.J. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2150-2156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), recent studies indicate that F2-factor Va interactions are not required for factor Va to enhance the catalytic efficiency of factor Xa within the prothrombinase complex (6Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Rather, the function of F2 in prothrombin may be to alter the conformation of the proenzyme so that its scissile bond(s) is more complementary to the active site of factor Xa (6Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). After release from prothrombin, F2 retains its ability to bind thrombin and influences thrombin function. Thus, F2 has been reported to slow the rate of thrombin inactivation by antithrombin (AT) (7Walker F.J. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5618-5622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), alter the environment of the catalytic site (8Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14974-14981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), enhance the esterolytic activity of thrombin (9Myrmel K.H. Lundblad R.L. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1767-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), inhibit the clotting activity of thrombin (10Jakubowski H.V. Kline M.D. Owen W.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11807-11812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crystallographic and chemical modification studies have shown that F2 interacts with a highly electropositive region in the COOH terminus of thrombin, also known as anion-binding exosite II or the heparin-binding region of thrombin (12Arni R.K.

The crystallographic structure of F2 complexed with active site-blocked thrombin reveals numerous ionic interactions between the anionic inner loop of the F2 kringle and the COOH-terminal helix of thrombin, a region abundant in arginine and lysine residues (12Arni R.K.

Using plasma, recombinant, and synthetic F2 peptides (F2, rF2, and sF2, respectively), we report that, contrary to what would have been predicted from the crystallographic data, residues in the COOH-terminal connecting peptide as well as the inner loop of the F2 kringle are necessary for F2 interaction with thrombin. In addition, to identify the regions in F2 that evoke functional changes in thrombin, we also compared sF2-(63–116), 2Sequential numbering of amino acids in F2 begins at the first amino acid of F2 (corresponds to amino acid 218 of prothrombin). The chymotrypsinogen numbering system is used for thrombin (15Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A.

Cellulose ester dialysis membranes were from Spectra/Por (Houston, TX). All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Cyclized synthetic peptides, purified by preparative reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, were prepared by Chiron Mimotopes Peptide Systems (San Diego, CA) as described by Fredenburgh et al. (17Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25493-25499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The cyclized peptides were resuspended in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), and titrated to pH 7.0 with NaOH. The peptides yielded the expected composition on quantitative amino acid analysis, and their identities were confirmed by mass spectrometry. sF2-(63–116) corresponds to residues 63–116 of human F2 except that Cys76 and Cys93 were replaced with serine residues. A peptide variant of sF2-(63–116) with a scrambled sequence but retaining the original positions of the two Cys residues (Cys64 and Cys88) also was prepared. sF2-(63–94) and sF2-(63–90), truncated derivatives of sF2-(63–116), also were synthesized. Plasmid pBS-hFII containing the entire coding region of human prothrombin as aHindIII-SstI fragment in pBluescript (Stratagene Ltd., La Jolla, CA) was generously provided by Dr. Ross MacGillivray (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC). Full-length and truncated constructs of rF2 were prepared by PCR amplification (35 PCR cycles for 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C) using plasmid pBS-hFII as the template. The primers used in the PCR reactions contained terminal restriction sites and are shown in TableI. The PCR products were gel-purified (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA), cleaved with NcoI and XhoI, and cloned as NcoI-XhoI fragments into the bacterial expression vector pET22b(+) (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI). The fidelity of each PCR-amplified construct was confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing using dideoxy chain termination and Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH).Table IPrimers used to PCR amplify recombinant F2 peptidesPrimerSequenceAmino acid hybridization site in F2NcoIA5′-GGATCCATGGCCGAAGGCTCCAGTGTGAAT-3′1XhoIB5′-GTGCTCGAGACGCCCTTCGATGGCCCTG-3′116NcoIC5′-GGATCCATGGCCTCAGCTGTGCAGCTGGTGGAG-3′55XhoID5′-GTGCTCGAGACAATAGTTGAGGTCGCAGTAC-3′93XhoIE5′-GTGCTCGAGTGAGTTGAAGTCCTGGTGCTTGCT-3′55Cys76 → SerF5′-GGCGTGTGGAGCTATGTGGCCGGG-3′76Cys93 → SerG5′-CTCAACTATAGTGAGGAGGCCGTG93H5′-GGAGTACTAGTAACCCTGGCCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAA-3′I5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACCAT-3′J5′-GGAGTACTAGTAACCCTGGC-3′ Open table in a new tab To ensure proper disulfide bond formation and to prevent the formation of intermolecular complexes, PCR mutagenesis was used to convert Cys76 and Cys93 to serine residues. Briefly, plasmid pBS-hFII was PCR amplified using primer B (Table I), which hybridizes downstream of the multiple cloning site of plasmid pBS-hFII, and the mutagenesis primer F (Table I), which contains a point mutation to convert Cys76 and Cys93 to serine residues (35 PCR cycles for 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C). The PCR product was gel purified and used as a primer on plasmid pBS-hFII for one PCR cycle (1 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 40 s at 72 °C). Primers C and D (Table I) were immediately added to the PCR reaction and 35 more cycles of PCR were carried out (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C). Primer C hybridizes upstream of the multiple cloning site of pBS-hFII while primer D hybridizes downstream of primer B. To convert Cys93 to serine, the mutagenesis procedure was repeated with primer G. The authenticity of the mutations, as well as the fidelity of the PCR-amplified constructs, were confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing. Recombinant F2 peptides were expressed inEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside induction using the histidine-tag pET system (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI). The expression vector used, pET22b(+), directs the recombinant proteins to the periplasmic space thereby promoting proper folding and disulfide bond formation. The periplasmic fraction was obtained using the cold osmotic shock method described by Ausubel et al. (18Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar). Histidine-binding Ni2+ resin (Novagen, Inc.) was used to purify the recombinant proteins. The isolated proteins at a concentration of 1 mg/ml were subjected to electrophoresis in 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205463) Google Scholar), transferred to nitrocellulose, and visualized by Ponceau S staining and immunoblotting as described previously (20Austin R.C. Howard P.L. D'Souza V.N. Klamut H.J. Ray P.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). F2 was obtained from a terminal prothrombin activation reaction as described by Fredenburgh et al. (17Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25493-25499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). F2 was dialyzed against TBS and the concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using ε2800.1% of 1.1 (21Church W.R. Oullette L.A. Messier T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8384-8391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin-agarose affinity chromatography was used to compare the affinities of plasma- and recombinant-F2 peptides for thrombin. 58 μm thrombin was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with a 10-fold molar excess of biotin-FPR in TBS. After dialysis against TBS, the biotin-FPR-thrombin was passed over streptavidin-agarose in TBS and excess binding sites were blocked with biotin. 0.2 ml of purified F2 peptide at a concentration of 1 mg/ml was applied at 4 °C to 0.5 ml of a streptavidin-agarose column containing 125 nmol of biotin-FPR-thrombin. The column had previously been equilibrated in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Elution of the protein was performed with 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing increasing concentrations of NaCl (from 10 to 500 mm). Aliquots from the flow-through and eluates were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above. The protein elution profiles were obtained by laser densitometry scans of immunoblots using the UltroScanTM XL laser densitometer (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology). The density of F2 in each fraction was expressed as a percentage of the total F2 density in the complete elution profile. The disulfide bonds in F2 and rF2-(1–116) were reduced and alkylated as described (22Bulleid N.J. Freidman R.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The peptides were resuspended in 50 mmdithiothreitol at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and placed at room temperature for 30 min. Iodoacetamide (made up fresh in sterile distilled water) was then added to 50 mm and the reaction mixture was placed at room temperature for 45 min in the dark. The reaction mixture was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20 using Spectra/Por cellulose ester dialysis membrane (10-kDa cutoff) and the protein concentration determined as described above for intact F2. The association between F2 peptides and thrombin was monitored by the F2-dependent fluorescence intensity change of anilinonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid-thrombin (ANS-FPR-thrombin). ANS-FPR-thrombin was prepared using ATA-FPR (N-((acetylthio)acetyl)-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl) as described by the supplier (Molecular Innovations Inc., Royal Oak, MI). Briefly, 10.6 μm thrombin was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 2.5-fold molar excess ATA-FPR in HBSE buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). The reaction mixture was dialyzed in HBSE buffer, incubated with 10-fold molar excess 2-(4-(iodoacetamide)anilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (Molecular Probes Inc.) in the presence of hydroxylamine for 60 min at room temperature in the dark, and then redialyzed. 500 μl of 100 nm ANS-FPR-thrombin was added to the same buffer in a semi-micro quartz cuvette. Using a Perkin-Elmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer with excitation and emission wavelengths set to 328 and 450 nm, respectively, and excitation and emission slit widths set to 12 nm, and an emission filter of 390 nm, readings were taken of ANS-FPR-thrombin alone (Io). Known quantities of F2 peptides (3.8 mm) were then added to the cuvette and, after mixing, the change in fluorescence was monitored (I). As a control, a scrambled variant of the 54-amino acid peptide was titrated to the same concentration, and any change in fluorescence due to nonspecific binding was used to correct the binding curve. TheKd values were calculated by plottingI/Io versus F2 peptide concentration. The parameters Kd and α were calculated by nonlinear regression (“Tablecurve,” Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) using the equation I/Io = (1 + ((Kd + [F2])/[ANS-IIa]) − ((1 + ((Kd + [F2])/[ANS-IIa]))2 − (4 × [F2]/[ANS-IIa]))0.5) × (α/2) + 1, where α is the maximum fluorescence change and assuming a stoichiometry of 1 (17Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25493-25499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Sulfated hirudin54–65 was labeled with FITC as described by Liuet al. (23Liu L.W. Ye J. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2 ml of TBS containing 10 nmFITC-hirudin54–65 was added to a 1 cm × 1-cm quartz cuvette in a Perkin-Elmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 492 and 522 nm, respectively, and excitation and emission slit widths were both set to 8 nm. The fluorescence intensity of 15 nm FPR-thrombin was measured before (Io) and after (I) the addition of either 20–40-μl aliquots of 161 μm F2 or 2–5-μl aliquots of 3.8 nm sF2-(63–116). Both F2 and sF2-(63–116) solutions contained 10 nm FITC-hirudin54–65 so that the concentration of FITC-hirudin54–65 remained constant. Titration was continued up to 43 μm F2 or 300 μm sF2-(63–116). After the experiment, intensity values were read from time drive profiles and I/Iovalues were calculated and plotted versus the peptide concentration. As a control, the fluorescence intensity was measured before and after the addition of up to 100 μm reduced and alkylated sF2-(63–116). Thrombin, at a final concentration of 0.6 nm, was mixed with either F2 (0–50 μm) or sF2-(63–116) (0–300 μm) in TSTW buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20) in a final volume of 75 μl. 25 μl of human fibrinogen and CaCl2 were then added to final concentrations of 4 μm and 2 mm, respectively, and the times for half-maximal increase in turbidity (T½) were determined at 23 °C by continuous measurement of absorbance at 405 nm using a Molecular Devices plate reader. The chromogenic activity of 20 nm thrombin in TBS was determined with 0.7–14 mm of various thrombin substrates in the presence of 25 μm F2 or 150 μm sF2-(63–116). The rates of thrombin-mediated hydrolysis were monitored at 405 nm in a plate reader and the percentage changes from control rates were determined. The second-order rate constant (k2) for the inhibition of thrombin by AT was determined under pseudo first-order conditions in the absence or presence of 1 unit/ml heparin. In a multiwell plate, aliquots (10 μl) of thrombin (final concentration of 10 nm) were incubated for varying intervals with 10 μl of 500 nm AT in TBSP (TBS containing 0.6% polyethylene glycol 8000) in the absence or presence of F2 or sF2-(63–116) in concentrations ranging from 10 to 500 μm. All reactions were terminated by the addition of 200 μm chromogenic substrate N-p-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg p-nitroanilide in 200 μl of TBSP containing 10 mg/ml Polybrene. Thrombin inhibitory activity in the presence of 1 unit/ml heparin was determined using thrombin and AT concentrations of 5 and 50 nm, respectively. Residual thrombin activity was then calculated by measuring absorbance for 5 min at 405 nm using a Molecular Devices plate reader. The pseudo first-order rate constants (k1) for thrombin inhibition were determined by fitting the data to the equation:k1·t = ln([P]o/[P]t), where [P]o is initial thrombin activity and [P]t is thrombin activity at time t(24Olsen S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The second-order rate constant, k2, was determined by dividing k1 by the AT concentration. F2 is a 116-amino acid prothrombin activation fragment that consists of a 14-residue interkringle peptide (region A), a 79-residue kringle (regions B, C, D, and E), and a 25-residue acidic COOH-terminal kringle-catalytic domain-connecting peptide (region F) (Fig. 1, panel A). For simplicity, the latter is referred to as the COOH-terminal connecting peptide. We mapped the thrombin-binding domain of F2 using deletion and point mutants prepared by recombinant and synthetic techniques. Schematic diagrams of the F2 peptides are shown in Fig. 1 (panel B) where F2, sF2, and rF2 denote plasma, synthetic, and recombinant F2 peptides, respectively. The deletion mutants encompass various portions of F2 including the kringle inner loop (residues 63–90),2the kringle outer loop (residues 1–55), the COOH-terminal connecting peptide (residues 92–116), and the COOH-terminal half of F2 (residues 55–116). The predicted molecular masses of F2, rF2-(1–116), and the three deletion derivatives rF2-(1–55), rF2-(55–116), and rF2-(1–93) are 14, 15, 6, 7, and 11 kDa, respectively. These predicted values are consistent with the apparent molecular masses of the peptides as determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). No immunoreactive material was found in lysates of E. coli transformed with pET22b(+), the parent vector lacking the F2 cDNA (data not shown). The presence of disulfide bonds in the F2 peptides was verified by comparing the electrophoretic mobilities of reduced versus non-reduced peptides. Disulfide bond-containing peptides migrated more slowly under reducing conditions than under non-reducing conditions (data not shown). The affinities of F2 peptides for thrombin were qualitatively assessed by subjecting the peptides to thrombin-agarose affinity chromatography. Biotin-FPR-treated thrombin was coupled to streptavidin-agarose as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This directed coupling procedure ensures that all surface basic residues are unmodified and that all the thrombin molecules are coupled in the same fashion. F2 peptides were applied to the column in 10 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and the column was then washed with increasing concentrations of NaCl. Aliquots from the eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The protein elution profiles were determined by laser densitometry scans of immunoblots. Intact F2 and rF2-(1–116) were retained on the thrombin-agarose column at concentrations up to 300 and 250 mm NaCl, respectively (Fig. 3, panel A). Upon reduction and alkylation of the disulfide bonds, both F2 and rF2-(1–116) eluted from the thrombin-agarose column as sharp peaks at 80 mm NaCl (Fig. 3, panel A). Bovine serum albumin, used as a negative control for thrombin-agarose binding, eluted from the column at 60 mm NaCl (data not shown). Like rF2-(1–116), the deletion derivatives rF2-(55–116) and sF2-(63–116) were retained on the thrombin-agarose column at NaCl concentrations up to 250 and 300 mm NaCl, respectively (Fig. 3, panel B). Both of these peptides contain the kringle inner loop (residues 63–93) as well as the COOH-terminal connecting peptide (residues 94–116). In contrast, deletion derivatives that contain only the kringle inner loop, sF2-(63–90), or the COOH-terminal connecting peptide, sF2-(92–116), did not bind to thrombin-agarose. Furthermore, neither the NH2-terminal interkringle peptide (residues 1–14) nor the outer loop of the kringle (residues 15–55) is required for thrombin-agarose binding since rF2-(1–55) and rF2-(1–93) bound weakly to thrombin-agarose (Fig. 3, panel B). The affinities of F2 peptides for ANS-FPR-thrombin were determined quantitatively by monitoring the change in probe fluorescence during peptide titration as described by Bock (8Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14974-14981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After titration, the I/Io values were plottedversus F2 peptide concentration and the data analyzed by nonlinear regression. Because of the low yields of rF2 peptides,Kd values were only determined for F2 and sF2 peptides. F2 and sF2-(63–116), both of which contain the kringle inner loop as well as the COOH-terminal connecting peptide, bind saturably to ANS-FPR-thrombin with Kd values of 4.1 and 51.3 μm, respectively (Fig. 4, Table II). The binding of F2 and sF2-(63–116) to ANS-FPR-thrombin is specific because there was no change in fluorescence intensity of ANS-FPR-thrombin in the presence of a scrambled variant of sF2-(63–116) (data not shown). Previous results, demonstrating (a) competitive binding of F2 and sF2-(63–116) to FPR-thrombin and (b) binding of both F2 and sF2-(63–116) to γ-thrombin, a proteolytic derivative of thrombin lacking exosite I, reveal that F2 and sF2-(63–116) bind to exosite II of thrombin (17Fredenburgh J.C.

Operator binding affinity was increased by the presence of guanine as demonstrated previously (Choi, K. Y., Lu, F., and Zalkin, H. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 24066–24072; Rolfes, R. J., and Zalkin, H. (1990) J. Bacteriol.172, 5637–5642), and conversely guanine binding affinity was increased by the presence of operator. Guanine enhanced operator affinity by increasing the association rate constant and decreasing the dissociation rate constant for binding. Operator had minimal effect on the association rate constant for guanine binding; however, this DNA decreased the dissociation rate constant for corepressor by ∼10-fold. Despite significant sequence and structural similarity between PurR and LacI proteins, PurR binds to its corepressor ligand with a lower association rate constant than LacI binds to its inducer ligand. However, the rate constant for PurR-guanine binding to operator is ∼3-fold higher than for LacI binding to its cognate operator under the same solution conditions. The distinct metabolic roles of the enzymes under regulation by these two repressor proteins provide a rationale for the observed functional differences.

Saier M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). PurR is a homodimer, and each monomer consists of a helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain connected to a core purine binding domain by a hinge region (19Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6207-6214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Schumacher M.A. Macdonald J.R. Björkman J. Mowbray S.L. Brennan R.G. J. Biol.

The x-ray crystallographic structures of holorepressor-operator and free PurR core binding domain (amino acids ∼60–341) have been determined (26Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G.

The DNA binding domain and a helix formed by the hinge sequence make direct contact with the operator DNA to recognize features of the specific cognate sequence (26Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The N-terminal helix-turn-helix domain binds in the major groove of the DNA, whereas the hinge helix, which appears to be disordered in the free protein, contacts the DNA sequence in the minor groove and introduces a bend of 45–50 ° in the DNA (26Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 30Nagadoi A. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Enari M. Kobayashi K. Yamamoto H. Sampei G. Mizobuchi K. Schumacher M.A. Brennan R.G. Nishimura Y. Structure. 1995; 3: 1217-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Each core domain contains N- and C-subdomains, designations based on similarity to the family of periplasmic sugar binding proteins (21Schumacher M.A. Macdonald J.R. Björkman J. Mowbray S.L. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12282-12288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G.

The corepressor binding pocket is located in the cleft between the N- and C-subdomains. Upon corepressor binding, the two N-subdomains appear to change their relative positions to generate the proper conformation for DNA binding (26Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 27Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Lu F. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Cell. 1995; 83: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Amino acids responsible for monomer-monomer interactions are dispersed across the two subdomains to form the subunit interface (26Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The key role of PurR in regulating a central biosynthetic pathway motivates a thorough understanding of the biochemical properties and the relationship of structure to function in this protein. Although corepressor binding in the absence of operator (19Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6207-6214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and operator binding affinity in the presence and the absence of guanine (19Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24066-24072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been measured, detailed parameters for PurR interactions with ligands have not been established. In this study, we have determined PurR binding constants to both operator DNA and the corepressor guanine under a consistent set of conditions, allowing a more complete analysis of the thermodynamics and kinetics of regulation in this system. PurR was purified in Buffer A, which contained 10 mmHEPES-KOH, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.6. All reactions for the equilibrium and kinetic analyses were conducted in Buffer E, based on modifications of the previously described Buffer II (20Rolfes R.J. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5637-5642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Choi K.Y. Lu F. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24066-24072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Buffer E contained 100 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 250 mm potassium glutamate, 150 mm sodium chloride, 10 mmmagnesium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA. The binding of PurR to operator is responsive to purine presence in this buffer (20Rolfes R.J. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5637-5642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Choi K.Y. Lu F. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24066-24072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Guanine solutions were made by either (a) dissolution of guanine to saturation in Buffer E by stirring overnight with mild heating (∼40 °C) or (b) dissolution of guanine to 40 mm in 1 m NaOH. These stock solutions were diluted to the appropriate concentrations for specific experiments, and the concentrations were confirmed by absorbance. The pH of final PurR and guanine solutions was not altered by the latter preparation process, and no differences in results between the methods of guanine dissolution were noted. Purine repressor was overexpressed and purified according to previously published procedures (20Rolfes R.J. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5637-5642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications.Escherichia coli BL21 cells were lysed by sonication instead of French press; phosphocellulose was used for further purification following DEAE chromatography instead of heparin agarose; and the gradient for the phosphocellulose column was 30–400 mm KCl in Buffer A. PurR was eluted from phosphocellulose at 300–350 mm KCl. The binding activity of the protein was determined by titration under stoichiometric conditions to be >90% for DNA and for guanine. The intrinsic fluorescence changes of PurR upon guanine binding were recorded within either 1-cm2 or 0.2 × 1.0-cm pathlength quartz cuvettes at room temperature in an SLM-8100 fluorescence spectrometer. The excitation wavelength for emission spectra was 290 nm. In some experiments, a cut-off filter (Corning, O-52) was used to record the total fluorescence change at wavelengths longer than 340 nm. Two methods were employed to correct for the fluorescence decrease caused by guanine absorption at the excitation wavelength (inner filter effect). The first method used the absorbance of each sample at 290 (Aex) and 350 nm (Aem), using the equation F =Fobs antilog [(Aex +Aem)/2] for correction. The second method employed the effect of guanine on the fluorescence ofN-acetyltryptophanamide. The fluorescence of the sample was corrected by the ratio ofFo/Fi forN-acetyltryptophanamide, where Focorresponds to the initial fluorescence and Ficorresponds to the fluorescence value at each guanine concentration. These methods resulted in similar correction values. PurR concentration was fixed at 2 × 10−7m monomer; guanine (1 × 10−8m to 3 × 10−5m) was added for binding assays with operator, whereas a higher concentration range (5 × 10−7m to 5 × 10−5m) was added for assays without operator. When present, operator concentration was 2 × 10−7m. All samples were incubated at room temperature for 1–2 h before the fluorescence measurements were taken. Corepressor binding affinity was determined by globally fitting the data using a 2 guanine:1 PurR dimer noncooperative binding model with the software package BIOEQS (32Royer C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Binding affinity was linked across data sets, while all other parameters were allowed to float. Operator DNA binding in the absence and the presence of corepressor, guanine (1 × 10−5m), was measured by nitrocellulose filter binding. Operator DNA (30 bp) was synthesized by the Great American Gene Company. The sequences of the two single-stranded DNAs were: 5′ GAATCCCTACGCAAACGTTTGCGTTTTCTG 3′, 5′ GACAGAAAACGCAAACGTTTGCGTAGGGAT 3′. These oligonucleotides were hybridized to form double-stranded operator fragments with 2-bp 5′-overhangs at either end. The operator fragments were then labeled by polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP. The incubation buffer for these measurements was Buffer E with 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA). Operator concentration was 2 × 10−12m. PurR was added in concentrations from 1 × 10−10m to 5 × 10−6m dimer in the absence of guanine and from 1 × 10−12m to 1 × 10−7m dimer in the presence of guanine. PurR was incubated with 1 × 10−5m guanine in Buffer E with BSA for 20 min before operator DNA was added. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 20 min before filtration through a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Samples were filtered through the membrane, and the retention of radioactivity on each filter was determined by scintillation counting. Operator affinity was determined by fitting the data to Equation 1. Y=Ym[PurR]/(Kd+[PurR])Equation 1 where Y is fractional saturation,Ym is a factor that allowsYmax (the saturation value) to float, [PurR] is purine repressor concentration in dimer, and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant, using IgorPro (Wavemetrics). Guanine binding affinities in the absence and the presence of operator DNA were measured by nitrocellulose filter binding. [14C]Guanine concentration was 3 × 10−8m with or without operator present. When present, operator concentration was 1 × 10−6m for protein concentrations <1 × 10−6m and was equimolar at protein concentrations ≥1 × 10−6m. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 2–3 h before filtration through a nitrocellulose membrane. The retention of radioactivity on the filter was determined by scintillation counting. Guanine binding affinity was determined by fitting the data to Equation 2. Y=Ym[PurR]n/(Kdn+[PurR]n)Equation 2 where Y is the fractional saturation,Ym is a factor that allowsYmax (the saturation value) to float,Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant, [PurR] is PurR concentration in monomer, and n is the Hill coefficient. Values for n were near unity in all cases. The association and dissociation rates for operator binding in the presence and the absence of guanine were measured by nitrocellulose filter binding. For association reactions, PurR at three different concentrations in Buffer E plus 50 μg/ml BSA was incubated with 8.3 × 10−11m32P-labeled operator DNA. Samples were filtered through nitrocellulose membranes following different incubation times. The amount of PurR-operator complex was determined by scintillation counting of each individual filter. The observed association rate (kobs) was determined by fitting the data at each individual protein concentration to Equation 3. F=A+ΔAe(−kobst)Equation 3 where F is the amount of operator-PurR, Ais the amount of operator-PurR at equilibrium, ΔA is the total change in operator-PurR between zero time and equilibrium,kobs is the observed rate constant, and t is time. F was measured by scintillation counting. The association rate constants were determined by fittingkobs at different protein concentrations into Equation 4. kobs=kassoc[PurR]+kdissocEquation 4 where kobs is the observed rate,kassoc is the association rate constant,kdissoc is the dissociation constant, and [PurR] is the protein concentration in dimer. Dissociation rates were measured in a similar manner, except that 5 × 10−8m PurR (dimer concentration) was incubated with 2.5 × 10−12m32P-labeled operator DNA at room temperature for 10 min before 3 × 10−7m cold operator DNA was added. When guanine was present, PurR (5 × 10−9m dimer) was incubated with 1 × 10−5m guanine at room temperature for 20 min prior to operator addition. The amount of complex present after different times following addition of cold operator was measured by filtering samples through nitrocellulose membranes. The dissociation rate constants were determined by fitting data into Equation 5. F=A+ΔAe(−kdissoct)Equation 5 where F is the amount of32P-labeled operator-PurR, A is the amount of32P-labeled operator-PurR at equilibrium, ΔAis the total change of 32P-labeled operator-PurR between zero time and equilibrium, kdissoc is the dissociation rate constant, and t is time. The association and dissociation rates of guanine binding to PurR in the presence and the absence of operator DNA were measured using a stopped flow system in an SLM-8100 fluorescence spectrometer. For association rates, PurR (4 × 10−7m) was mixed with an equal volume of various concentrations of guanine in Buffer E. When present, operator concentration was equimolar to PurR dimer concentration. For dissociation rates, PurR (4 × 10−6m monomer) and guanine (8 × 10−6m) were incubated in Buffer E at room temperature for 1 h before being diluted 3.5-fold with Buffer E. The dissociation rate in the presence of operator was measured by manually diluting a solution containing PurR (4 × 10−6m monomer), operator DNA (4 × 10−6m), and guanine (4.5 × 10−6m) into a 20-fold volume of Buffer E in a 1-cm2 quartz cuvette. Fluorescence signal changes during the association or dissociation processes were monitored using an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and following emission using a 340 nm cut-off filter. The association rate constants and dissociation rate constant in the absence of operator were determined by fitting data to Equation 6. F=A+ΔAe(−kobst)+mtEquation 6 where m is a constant slope term that accounts for observed photobleaching. In the presence of operator, the dissociation rate data were fit to Equation 7. F=A+ΔA1e(−k1t)+ΔA2e(−k2t)+mtEquation 7 where ΔA1 and ΔA2 correspond to the change in fluorescence attributable to PurR and PurR-operator complex, respectively. Because fits to this equation yielded a value for k1that is within error of that measured for PurR-guanine dissociation in the absence of operator, k1 was fixed to this value for determining k2. Guanine binding affinity for PurR in the presence and the absence of operator DNA was determined by nitrocellulose filter binding. Guanine concentration was fixed well below the equilibrium constant, and PurR concentration was varied. There are two guanine binding sites in each dimer of PurR, and the end point of this titration is a single guanine bound to each dimer. Therefore, the affinity for the first binding site was the value measured in this assay (Fig. 1).

PurR contains four tryptophans in each monomer of PurR (22Rolfes R.J. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19653-19661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y.

Trp147is positioned near the opening to the corepressor binding pocket in aporepressor (27Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Lu F. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Cell. 1995; 83: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structures, the environment of Trp147 is less aromatic in the purine-PurR-operator complex than the free core binding domain (26Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 27Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Lu F. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Cell. 1995; 83: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This environmental change for Trp147 presumably generates the observed increase of the intrinsic fluorescence signal and the slight red shift of the emission spectrum from 340 to 342 nm (19Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6207-6214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using this intrinsic fluorescence signal, the effects of different concentrations of guanine were recorded (Fig. 1). Due to the absorbance of guanine at the excitation wavelength, correction of the observed fluorescence as reported under “Materials and Methods” was essential. The results from both filter binding and fluorescence measurements demonstrated that the presence of operator DNA increased PurR affinity for guanine by 7–17-fold (Table I). A DNA sequence derived from thepurF operator was used in operator binding assays for convenient comparison with previously published results (31Choi K.Y. Lu F. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24066-24072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PurR exhibits higher affinity for this optimized sequence over a 30-bp purF operator but lower affinity compared with a 270-bp purF operator sequence (19Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6207-6214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Rolfes R.J. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5637-5642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Choi K.Y. Lu F. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24066-24072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Operator affinities in the presence and the absence of guanine were determined by filter binding. As shown in Fig. 2, guanine increased operator affinity significantly. According to the equilibrium dissociation constants derived from these titrations, the presence of guanine increases PurR affinity for operator by ∼210-fold. Two paths exist from aporepressor to purine- and operator-bound holorepressor as shown in Fig. 3. As predicted by thermodynamic principles, the total free energy for route 1 (ΔG1 = ΔGA + 2ΔGB) should equal that of the alternative path, route 2 (ΔG2 = 2ΔGD + ΔGC). These equations assume equivalent affinity for both purine binding sites in a dimer, as indicated by the binding studies. The equilibrium dissociation constants and ΔG values calculated for different conditions are listed in Table I. Using values derived from filter binding experiments, ΔG1 and ΔG2 were −27.5 kcal and −27.2 kcal, respectively, taking the stoichiometry for guanine into account. The 0.3-kcal difference between the total free energy changes for these two paths may derive from experimental limitations, in particular difficulty with filter binding at high protein concentrations. Values of −26.5 and −27.2 kcal are calculated for ΔG1 and ΔG2, respectively, using Kd values determined by fluorescence for the guanine binding free energy determination. The difference between ΔG1 values calculated from filter binding and fluorescence measurements may be ascribed to the high error for the fluorescence measurements. Kinetic constants for guanine binding were determined by monitoring the fluorescence signal change in PurR as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 4, the association rate constants in the presence and in the absence of operator were very similar, ∼1 × 104m−1s−1. However, these values were 10-fold lower than the corresponding rate constant for the homologous LacI protein to its ligand IPTG (Table II). The purine-PurR dissociation rate constant was decreased ∼10-fold in the presence of operator (Fig. 5 and Table II), demonstrating that operator binding elicits increased guanine binding affinity primarily by affecting the dissociation rate for the corepressor.Table IISummary of ligand binding constantskdissociationkassociationkdissociation/kassociationKd2-2001Kd values correspond to those measured by fluorescence titration (see Table I).s−1m−1 s−1mmPurR + operator1.2 ± 0.02 × 10−21.3 ± 0.08 × 1049.2 × 10−79.8 × 10−7PurR1.2 ± 0.02 × 10−11.2 ± 0.04 × 10410 × 10−67.0 × 10−6LacI2.1 ± 0.1 × 10−11.2 ± 0.09 × 1051.8 × 10−60.8 × 10−62-2001 Kd values correspond to those measured by fluorescence titration (see Table I).

The dissociation rates for guanine binding in the absence of operator were determined by stopped flow fluorescence spectroscopy. The excitation wavelength was 290 nm, and a O-52 filter (≥340 nm) was used to monitor emission. The dissociation rate constants were determined as described under “Materials and Methods” from multiple data sets. A, in the presence of operator. The data shown are the scaled average of six data sets. A mixture of PurR (4 × 10−6m monomer), operator (4 × 10−6m), and guanine (4.5 × 10−6m) was diluted 20-fold with Buffer E manually in a 1-cm2 quartz cuvette. B, in the absence of operator. The data are the scaled average of seven data sets.

As shown in Figs. 6 and7, guanine increased the association rate constant for operator by ∼50-fold and decreased the dissociation rate constant by ∼20-fold, resulting in substantial stabilization of the PurR-operator complex. The dissociation rate and equilibrium constants for LacI binding to its operator were determined in the same buffer. Interestingly, the association rate constant for PurR holorepressor binding to its operator is greater than that for LacI binding to its operator at the ionic strengths employed for this assay, as shown in Table III.Figure 7Determination of dissociation rate constants for operator binding. The dissociation rates for operator binding were determined by filter binding. All the reactions were carried out in Buffer E with 50 μg/ml BSA. PurR (5 × 10−8m dimer) was incubated with 2.5 × 10−12m32P-labeled operator DNA at room temperature for 10 min before 3 × 10−7m cold operator DNA was added. PurR (5 × 10−9mdimer) was incubated with 1 × 10−5m of guanine, when present, at room temperature for 20 min prior to initiation of dissociation. The amount of complex present after different times following addition of cold operator was measured by filtering samples through a nitrocellulose membrane.

Open table in a new tab All the equilibrium dissociation constants for guanine and operator binding to the purine repressor, constituting a complete thermodynamic loop, were determined in this study. The results demonstrated that guanine increased the operator binding affinity for PurR by ∼210-fold, a value greater than found previously (∼14-fold) (31Choi K.Y. Lu F. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24066-24072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, these measurements demonstrated for the first time that the presence of operator increases PurR affinity for guanine. PurR, as a master regulator for expression of genes whose products are involved in purine and pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, must be able to respond appropriately to in vivo environmental changes, specifically alterations in the level of purine available. In the absence of purine, the expression of biosynthetic enzymes is unimpeded, and free purine levels rise from nucleotide/nucleoside degradation as production exceeds demands. As purine levels approach the Kd for binding to PurR, the holorepressor binds to the operator and diminishes expression for the genes associated with that operator site. If PurR binds to the operator in the absence of purine, its affinity for available purine is increased, and the sensitivity of the system to repression is enhanced. Exogenous sources and endogenous degradation of high levels of nucleosides and nucleotides provide sufficient free purine to bind PurR and promote pur operator binding. PurR holorepressor exerts tighter control over the pathway from phosphoribosylpyrophosphate to IMP than the conversion from IMP to AMP or GMP (1He B. Shiau A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Smith J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4555-4562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4He B. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1009-1013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6He B. Smith J.M. Zalkin H. J.

Whende novo IMP synthesis is decreased in response to PurR-purine binding to pur operator sites, salvage pathways are used for production of IMP, AMP, and GMP, using the available free bases (33Neuhard J. Nygaard P. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimirium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 445-473Google Scholar). In this way, E. coli cells avoid the complicated and energy-expensive de novo pathway from phosphoribosylpyrophosphate to AMP and GMP when free purine is available. As free purine concentrations decrease, puroperators are released from PurR repression until the levels of free purine rise again. These mechanisms not only ensure that purine mononucleotides are available but also that the pool of free purine is depleted rapidly, thereby avoiding the accumulation of potentially toxic levels (33Neuhard J. Nygaard P. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimirium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 445-473Google Scholar). We have measured the association and dissociation rates for PurR binding both to operator DNA sequences and to a corepressor, guanine. The equilibrium binding constants determined from the kinetic values are consistent with the direct measurements of affinity (Tables II and III). Guanine increases the affinity of PurR for its operator by (a) increasing the association rate and (b) decreasing the dissociation rate. When the cellular purine concentrations are low, PurR aporepressor interacts with its operator sites with a slower association rate constant and a faster dissociation rate constant, minimizing occupancy of operator sites and avoiding inhibition of necessary downstream gene expression. When cellular purine levels increase, PurR-purine complex binds to its cognate operator sites with an increased association rate constant and dissociates more slowly from the operator, thereby blocking downstream gene expression. In the presence of operator, PurR binds to its corepressor ligand with lower rate constants for both association and dissociation compared with the homologous LacI protein (Figs. 4 and 5). In the presence of guanine, PurR binds to its operator with a faster association rate constant than LacI and a diminished dissociation rate constant. In the absence of guanine, PurR binds to its operator with a lower association rate constant, and a similar dissociation rate constant as observed for LacI. These differences can be rationalized by the different physiological roles for these proteins. Although both proteins are members of the LacI family of proteins, the role of PurR in the metabolism of the cell is distinct from that of LacI. Specifically, the lactose operon encodes proteins involved in the catabolism of sugars. LacI controls the expression of mRNA encoding β-galactosidase, lactose permease, and thiogalactoside transacetylase, enzymes involved in the transport and breakdown of lactose and other β-galactosides to generate an energy source. LacI affinity for operator is diminished upon binding to inducer ligands (e.g. IPTG or allolactose). The release of operator allows transcription of the downstream genes and production of the enzymes for lactose transport and digestion. LacI must both bind to its ligand rapidly (∼1 × 104m−1 s−1 for LacI-operator binding to IPTG and ∼1 × 105m−1s−1 for LacI binding to IPTG) and release operator quickly (>0.1 s−1 for LacI-IPTG dissociation from lacoperator) to free the promoter for transcription. This process generates the requisite enzymes in a short time frame to ensure rapid utilization of environmentally available lactose as a carbon source. In contrast, PurR controls the expression of multiple enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of nucleotides and other related anabolic pathways. PurR represses the expression of these genes upon binding to its corepressor ligand (guanine or hypoxanthine). In the absence of purine, the operator is primarily in the free state, and biosynthesis of mRNA and encoded biosynthetic enzymes can proceed. As purine levels accumulate, either from nucleoside/nucleotide breakdown or from environmental sources, binding to PurR occurs but with a lower association rate constant than observed for the LacI protein. The PurR-guanine complex then binds with increased affinity to the operator sequence. With respect to the dissociation process, rate constants for release of DNA are lower than for the corresponding states of LacI, and the rate constant for release of guanine in the presence of operator DNA is also significantly diminished. The kinetic differences observed for PurR compared with LacI parallel the distinct metabolic roles of the enzymes controlled by these regulatory proteins. LacI must respond rapidly to the presence of lactose in the environment, and the enzymes must be generated quickly to ensure capture of this energy source. In contrast, PurR effectively “integrates” the concentration of available purine over a period of time before generating a transcriptional response to alterations in purine levels. Minor changes in the pool of free purine do not elicit an immediate alteration in the production of biosynthetic enzymes; rather, an enduring rise in the levels of free purine results in the shut-down of mRNA for the enzymes in this pathway. Once the PurR-corepressor-operator complex forms, the release of corepressor from PurR-operator and PurR-corepressor from its operator are both slowed by ∼10-fold and are slower than the corresponding reactions for LacI. The lower dissociation rate constant for PurR holorepressor-operator results in concomitantly slow generation of enzymes for de novo synthesis when purines are available for salvage. These kinetic differences in proteins with high sequence, structure, and functional similarity (21Schumacher M.A. Macdonald J.R. Björkman J. Mowbray S.L. Brennan R.G. J. Biol.

Such differences presumably arise from subtle alterations in structure that control rates for the respective binding reactions. Previous work has shown that a single amino acid change (K84L) in LacI can significantly decrease the inducer binding rate constants for this protein by >100-fold and consequently alter the rate of release for operator DNA substantially (36Chang W.I. Olson J.S. Matthews K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17613-17622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, small changes in sequence can be presumed to have dramatic effects on the functional properties of even closely related proteins. Despite high levels of sequence similarity and structural alignment (21Schumacher M.A. Macdonald J.R. Björkman J. Mowbray S.L. Brennan R.G. J. Biol.

In mammalian cells the PKC family has been implicated in the regulation of a host of cellular processes including growth, secretion, ion channel conductance, gene expression, and receptor regulation (1Newton A.C.

Biochem. 1992; 208: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 3Huang K.-P. BioFactors. 1990; 2: 171-178PubMed Google Scholar). Each PKC isozyme contains a catalytic (C) domain that catalyzes the phosphorylation of specific Ser and Thr residues and an regulatory (R) domain that inhibits the activity of the C domain via intramolecular interactions (for review, see Ref. 1Newton A.C.

Some forms of PKC can be activated by receptor-mediated production of diacylglycerol, which binds to cysteine-rich sites within the R domain (4Ono Y. Fujii T. Igarashi K. Kuno T. Tanaka C. Kikkawa U.

Grisham C.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7714-7721Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The binding of diacylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, and Ca2+ to the R domain induces a conformational change that relieves the inhibitory effect of a pseudosubstrate-like sequence on catalytic activity. Evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from experiments in which a small peptide corresponding to the pseudosubstrate-like sequence within the R domain of PKCα significantly inhibited PKC catalytic activity (8House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), antibodies raised against this peptide constitutively activated the enzyme (9Makowske M. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16155-16159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mutagenesis of sequences within the pseudosubstrate site of the PKC R domain resulted in partial activation of the enzyme (10Pears C.J. Kour G. House C. Kemp B.E. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, allosteric activation of the enzyme has been shown to expose the pseudosubstrate region of PKC to proteolytic attack consistent with its removal from the active site of the enzyme (11Orr J.W.

Recently we examined the effects of the entire R domain of PKC on PKC activity in vitro and demonstrated that the R domain of human PKCα (amino acids 1–270), when expressed as a fusion protein with GST, behaved as a potent competitive inhibitor of PKC catalytic activity (12Parissenti A.M.

We also showed that the PKCα R domain inhibited PKC-mediated phenotypes in intact yeast cells and suggested that PKCα R might provide a useful reagent to achieve specific, dominant inhibition of PKC (12Parissenti A.M. Kim S.A. Colantonio C.M. Snihura A.L. Schimmer B.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the specificity with which the R domains from human PKCα and mouse PKCε inhibit PKC activity. We demonstrate that the R domains of PKCα and PKCε potently inhibit PKCα activity but do not appreciably inhibit the activities of other Ser/Thr or Tyr kinases tested. We also find that the deletion of the pseudosubstrate sequence from PKC Rα does not markedly diminish its ability to inhibit PKC holoenzyme or proteolytically activated PKCα (PKM) activity. On this basis, we suggest that R domain sequences outside the pseudosubstrate region of PKC may contribute significantly to enzyme autoinhibition. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (fromPisaster ochraceus), human recombinant srckinase, and their peptide substrates (APRTPGGRR and KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK, respectively) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The PKCα substrate [Ser-25]PKC19–31(RFARKGSLRQKNV) and the PKCα pseudosubstrate peptide PKC19–36 (RFARKGALRQKNVHEVKN) were obtained from Canadian Life Technologies Inc. (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). LRRASLG (Kemptide), PMA, purified rat brain PKCα, and isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside were obtained from Sigma, and PKM was obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (San Diego, CA). Recombinant human casein kinase II and casein kinase II substrate peptide (RRREEETEEE) were from New England Biolabs (Missisauga, Ontario, Canada). The catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase purified from bovine heart and cGMP-dependent protein kinase from bovine aorta were purchased from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). The myosin light chain kinase-specific substrate K-MLC11–23 (KKRPQRATSNVFS) was from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). Chicken gizzard myosin light chain kinase and bovine brain calmodulin were generous gifts from Michael P. Walsh (University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada). Radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP (111 TBq/mmol) was from Mandel Scientific (Guelph, Ontario, Canada). A fusion protein in which amino acids 1–270 of human PKCα was fused in frame to GST (GST-Rα) was prepared as described by Parissenti et al. (12Parissenti A.M. Kim S.A. Colantonio C.M. Snihura A.L. Schimmer B.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) except that one tablet containing a wide spectrum of protease inhibitors (CompleteTM, Boehringer Mannheim) was added per 50 ml of bacterial cell lysate and elution off glutathione-Sepharose columns was by several overnight incubations with 50 mm glutathione at 4 °C. A GST fusion protein in which the first 32 amino acids of PKC Rα were deleted (GST-RαΔ1–32) was prepared by cloning aDraIII-EcoRI fragment of the human PKCα R domain in pBluescript SK+ (12Parissenti A.M. Kim S.A. Colantonio C.M. Snihura A.L. Schimmer B.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) into the GST fusion protein expression vector pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using standard cloning techniques. A GST fusion protein containing the R domain of PKCε (amino acids 1–385) was prepared by cloning anNcoI-PvuII fragment from mouse PKCε cDNA in pMT2ε (a gift from Dr. John Knopf, Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA) into the SmaI and EcoRI sites of the GST fusion vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using standard cloning techniques. Construction of each of the expression vectors was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA sequencing. These fusion proteins also were purified from Escherichia coli DH5α as described above. The GST-R fusion proteins were dialyzed in 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and stored frozen at −70 °C. Samples of GST-Rα, GST-RαΔ1–32, and GST-Rε in SDS sample buffer were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS as described by Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207123) Google Scholar), and electrophoretically blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then immunoblotted using a goat anti-rat brain PKC antibody (14Huang K.P. Huang F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14781-14787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for PKCε (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); antigen-antibody reactivity was detected using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PKCα catalytic activity was measured by monitoring the transfer of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP to the peptide substrate [Ser-25]PKC19–31 (8House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) in 30-min reactions at 30 °C. Unless otherwise indicated, reactions (100 μl) contained 2 μm [Ser-25]PKC19–31, 164 μm [γ-32P]ATP (0.5 μCi), 18 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 46.4 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 2.5 μm PMA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 milliunits of purified rat brain PKCα. The phosphatidylserine and PMA were added together as a sonicated emulsion to form small unilamellar vesicles. Assays of PKM activity were conducted under similar conditions except that the concentration of [Ser-25]PKC19–31 was 1 μm, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was added to stabilize the enzyme, and reactions were for 12 min. Reactions were terminated by spotting 90 μl of sample onto P81 phosphocellulose paper filters. Filters were washed with 1% phosphoric acid and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Other Ser/Thr kinase activities and src Tyr kinase activity were assayed by measuring the transfer of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP to acceptor peptide substrates under standard conditions for each enzyme. In each case, peptide substrate concentrations were equal to experimentally determinedKm values. cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity was measured by incubating the catalytic subunit of the enzyme (25 ng) with 20 μm Kemptide (15Kemp B.E. Graves D.J. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4888-4894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 5 min at 30 °C in a reaction (50 μl) containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi), and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. cGMP-dependent protein kinase assays were conducted under identical conditions to that described for cAMP-dependent protein kinase except that 4 μm Kemptide and 2 μm cGMP were present in the reaction. Mitogen-activated protein kinase activity was assayed by incubating the enzyme (13.5 ng) with 1.5 mm mitogen-activated protein kinase substrate peptide for 5 min at room temperature in a reaction (25 μl) containing 12.5 μm β-glycerolphosphate, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi), and 12.5 mm3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid, pH 7.2 (16Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Myosin light chain kinase activity was measured by incubating the enzyme (25 ng) with 20 μm K-MLC11–23 substrate peptide (17Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. House C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7471-7475Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) for 4 min at 30 °C in a reaction (100 μl) containing 4 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 150 μm CaCl2, 1 mg of calmodulin, 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (0.8 μCi), and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Casein kinase II activity was measured by incubating the enzyme (0.5 milliunit) with 500 μmsubstrate peptide (18Kunzel E.A. Mulligan J.A. Sommercorn J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9136-9140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 5 min at 37 °C in a reaction (50 μl) containing 130 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 4.8 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP (1.2 μCi), and 20 mm2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, pH 6.9. srckinase assays were conducted by incubating 6 units of purified enzyme with 100 μm substrate peptide (cdc26–20) for 10 min at room temperature in a reaction (50 μl) containing 2.5 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.625 mm sodium orthovanadate, 31 mm sodium acetate, 31 mm MgCl2, 112 μm[γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi), and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. Reactions were terminated and processed as described above for PKC. Purified preparations of GST-Rα, GST-RαΔ1–32, and GST-Rε yielded major protein bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels that migrated with apparent molecular weights in reasonable agreement with their predicted masses (56 kDa for GST-Rα, 52 kDa for GST-RαΔ1–32, and 68 kDa for GST-Rε) including 26 kDa for the GST component (Fig. 1). GST-Rα and GST-RαΔ1–32 also reacted with the antibody that recognizes the α, β, and γ isoforms of rat PKC (14Huang K.P. Huang F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14781-14787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas GST-Rε reacted with the PKCε antibody (Fig. 1), thus confirming the identity of the fusion proteins. The GST-Rε preparation contained a small amount of contaminating low molecular weight material that was visible on stained gels; presumably, this material represents a proteolytic product of GST-Rε, as it is strongly immunoreactive with the monoclonal PKCε antibody and has a molecular weight equal to the R domain of PKCε without GST attached. Previously we demonstrated that GST-Rα is a potent competitive inhibitor of yeast-expressed bovine PKCα and yeast-expressed rat PKCβ-I (12Parissenti A.M. Kim S.A. Colantonio C.M. Snihura A.L. Schimmer B.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To assess whether the inhibition of protein kinase activity by GST-Rα was PKC-specific, we examined the ability of GST-Rα to inhibit the activities of several Ser/Thr and Tyr kinases. As shown in Fig. 2 A, GST-Rα potently inhibited the activity of purified rat brain PKCα (IC50 = 40 nm) but did not inhibit the activities of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, cGMP-dependent protein kinase, or myosin light chain kinase and only marginally inhibited the activities of casein kinase II, mitogen activated protein kinase, and src kinase. In fact, GST-Rα stimulated the activities of cGMP-dependent protein kinase and myosin light chain kinase, although the mechanism of this activation by GST-Rα is unknown. To determine whether the effects of GST-Rα were isozyme-specific, we examined the effects of GST-Rε on PKCα activity. GST-Rε (Fig. 2 B) also inhibited PKCα activity (IC50 = 60 nm) while having little or no effect on the other Ser/Thr or Tyr kinases described above. As determined from double-reciprocal plots of enzyme versus substrate concentration, GST-Rα and GST-Rε each competitively inhibited PKCα activity with Ki values of 0.5 ± 0.03 μm (Fig. 3 A) and 0.8 ± 0.4 μm (Fig. 3 B), respectively. GST alone at concentrations up to 10 μm did not inhibit PKCα activity (Fig. 4), nor did it inhibit the activities of any of the other protein kinases tested above (data not shown). These data indicate that the R domains of PKCα and PKCε are selective, competitive inhibitors of PKC activity but do not exhibit PKC isoform selectivity when assayed in vitro in the presence of activating lipids.Figure 3Competitive inhibition of PKCα by GST-R fusion proteins and the pseudosubstrate peptide PKC19–36. GST-Rα (A), GST-Rε (B), and GST-RαΔ1–32 (C) were evaluated for their abilities to inhibit PKCα as a function of substrate ([Ser-25]PKC19–31) concentration. Purified preparations of each fusion protein (•) or GST alone (○) were added to enzymatic assays for PKCα activity at final concentrations of 1.0 μm. Results are expressed as double-reciprocal plots of substrate concentration (μm) versus enzymatic activity expressed as picomoles of 32P transferred from [γ-32P]ATP to [Ser-25]PKC19–31/min/μg of protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Inhibitory effects of GST-R fusion proteins and the pseudosubstrate peptide PKC19–36 on PKCα activity. The catalytic activity of purified rat brain PKCα was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of GST-Rα (▴), GST-Rε (□), GST-RαΔ1–32 (▪), PKC19–36 (•), or GST alone (○). PKC activity is expressed as a percentage of the maximal activity (340 ± 35 nmol of 32P transferred from [γ-32P]ATP to [Ser-25]PKC19–31/min/mg of protein, n = 4) obtained in the absence of inhibitor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the R domains of PKCα and PKCε have different pseudosubstrate sequences, their lack of selectivity for PKC isozymes (Fig. 2) could be reconciled, as four amino acid residues within the PKCα and PKCε pseudosubstrate sequences are conserved (19Selbie L.A. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Sheng Y. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24296-24302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including Arg-22, which is essential for the inhibitory activity of the PKCα pseudosubstrate peptide (20House C. Kemp B.E. Cell. Signalling. 1990; 2: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). On a molar basis, however, the GST-Rα and GST-Rε fusion proteins inhibited PKC activity 100–200 times more potently than did the PKC pseudosubstrate peptide PKC19–36 (Fig. 4), which has a Ki for PKCα of 26 μm (data not shown). These observations raised the possibility that regions within the PKC R domain but outside the pseudosubstrate site play important roles in the inhibition of PKC activity. To test this hypothesis further, a fusion protein was prepared in which amino acids 1–32 of the PKCα R domain were deleted and the remaining sequence (amino acids 33–270) was linked in frame with GST. This protein, GST-RαΔ1–32, which lacks the pseudosubstrate sequence, retained the ability to inhibit the activity of purified rat brain PKCα over a concentration range similar to that seen for GST-Rα and GST-Rε (Fig. 4); inhibition of PKCα activity by GST-RαΔ1–32 was competitive (Fig. 3 C;Ki = 0.25 ± 0.12 μm). These observations strongly suggest that regions within the PKC R domain but outside the pseudosubstrate sequence play a significant role in the inhibition of PKC catalytic activity. We next examined the effects of GST-Rα, GST-RαΔ1–32, and GST-Rε on protamine-activated PKCα and on PKM to distinguish direct effects of the fusion proteins on PKCα from indirect effects due to sequestration of lipids. Protamine serves both as a substrate for PKC and as an allosteric activator of the enzyme, thus obviating the need for phosphatidylserine, PMA, and Ca2+ in the assay (21Leventhal P.S. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13906-13913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKM is a purified proteolytic product of PKCα that contains only the catalytic half of the protein and neither requires nor is responsive to phosphatidylserine, phorbol ester, or Ca2+ (22Lee M.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14867-14870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 A, GST-Rα inhibited protamine-activated PKCα in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 650 ± 80 nm(n = 3). GST-RαΔ1–32 and GST-Rε also inhibited protamine-activated PKC but with somewhat higher IC50 values of 1050 ± 60 nm(n = 3) and 1300 ± 100 nm(n = 3), respectively. GST alone did not inhibit protamine-activated PKCα. The inhibitory effects of the GST-R fusion proteins could be overcome with higher concentrations of protamine (data not shown), suggesting that the GST-R fusion proteins were competitive with substrate; however, the double-reciprocal plots of velocity versus protamine concentration were parabolic in the absence or presence of PKCα R, consistent with positive cooperative effects of protamine on PKC activity observed previously (12Parissenti A.M. Kim S.A. Colantonio C.M. Snihura A.L. Schimmer B.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 21Leventhal P.S. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13906-13913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GST-R fusion proteins were considerably more potent inhibitors of protamine-activated PKCα than was the pseudosubstrate peptide PKC19–36, as the pseudosubstrate peptide did not inhibit protamine-activated PKCα (Fig. 5 A) even at concentrations as high as 50 μm. This finding is consistent with the data presented in Fig. 4 which shows that the GST-R fusion proteins inhibit PKCα activity with potencies that are 100–200-fold greater than PKC19–36. GST-RαΔ1–32 and GST-Rε also inhibited PKM activity with IC50 values of approximately 500 nm (Fig. 5 B). As expected, phosphatidylserine, PMA, and Ca2+ had little effect on PKM activity (data not shown). These observations thus indicate that the inhibition of PKCα activity by GST-R fusion proteins may result at least in part from direct effects of the fusion proteins on the catalytic domain of the enzyme. As shown in this in vitro study, GST-Rα and GST-Rε inhibited lipid-activated PKC activity effectively and with equal potency but did not inhibit the activities of several other Ser/Thr protein kinases or the src Tyr kinase (Figs. 2 and4). Thus the GST-R fusion proteins displayed a high degree of specificity for PKC but lacked appreciable PKC isozyme selectivity under these in vitro conditions. Although a number of observations indicate that the R domains of PKC contribute to the selective actions of different PKC isozymes, isozyme selectivity seems to depend upon the responsiveness of the PKC isoforms to different activating ligands and the targeting of the PKCs to different subcellular compartments (23Yedovitzky M. Mochly-Rosen D. Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Ron D. Abramovitch E. Cerasi E. Nesher R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1417-1420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 24Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 25Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), factors that were not assessed in the in vitro assays of PKC activity described here. The inhibition of lipid-activated PKCα by the GST-R fusion proteins may have reflected competition between GST-R and substrate for the active site of PKC (8House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) or may have been secondary to the sequestration of lipid cofactors. The sequestration of lipids might impact on PKC activity by reducing the effective concentrations required for activation of PKC, by reducing the electrostatic potential of the vesicles thereby preventing PKC binding to lipid surfaces (1Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar), or by inhibiting delivery of the PKC substrate peptide to the enzyme (26Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol Chem. 1992; 267: 22891-22896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, lipids appeared to contribute to the inhibitory potency of the GST-R fusion proteins, because the IC50 values of the GST-R fusion proteins were 1 order of magnitude lower in lipid-dependent assays of PKCα activity compared with the lipid-independent assays of PKC activity (Fig. 4 versus Fig. 5). Although the concentrations of phosphatidylserine (approximately 50 μm) in the PKC assays were approximately 1000-fold higher than the concentrations of fusion proteins required for 50% inhibition of lipid-ativated PKCα (approximately 50 nm), the regulatory domain constructs may have sequestered up to 12 times the amount of phosphatidylserine as estimated from direct PKC-lipid binding assays (27Orr J.W. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4661-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and may have sterically masked access to 100 times the amount of lipid as estimated from light scattering and fluorescent energy transfer measurements (28Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Reductions in surface electrostatic surface potential may have had additional effects on the interaction of PKC with lipid surfaces. Therefore, it is possible that the increased inhibitory potency of the GST-R fusion proteins on lipid-activated PKC activity resulted from a nonselective sequestration of lipids required for enzyme activation. Nonetheless, the GST fusion proteins inhibited lipid-independent activated forms of PKCα (Fig. 5), indicating that the GST fusion proteins can directly inhibit the catalytic domain of the protein. Furthermore, in the absence of lipid, GST-Rα inhibited PKCα activity with a 2-fold greater potency than GST-Rε or GST-RαΔ1–32 (Fig. 5), suggesting a modest degree of isotype selectivity and a modest role for the pseudosubstrate region in the inhibition of PKC activity by GST-R under these in vitroconditions. Although there is considerable evidence that the pseudosubstrate region of PKC plays a role in the autoinhibition of the enzyme, our observations raise the possibility that other regions in the PKC R domain have significant PKC inhibitory activity. We find that the R domain of PKCα is a substantially more potent PKC inhibitor than is the pseudosubstrate peptide PKC19–36 either in the presence of absence of lipid activators and that the R domain of PKCα retains significant PKC inhibitory activity after removal of the pseudosubstrate site (Figs. 4 and 5). Additional support for this hypothesis comes from observations of Riedel et al. (29Riedel H. Su L. Hansen H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4728-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This group found that deletion of the N-terminal 153 amino acids of bovine PKCα, including the pseudosubstrate and phorbol ester-binding domains, led to increased PKC constitutive activity and a loss of phorbol ester-activated enzyme activity, consistent with an autoinhibitory function for the pseudosubstrate site. They also observed, however, that the truncated enzyme could be further activated 2.5–3-fold by the addition of Ca2+. Although they did not comment on the significance of this finding, their results are consistent with our suggestion that domains outside the pseudosubstrate site contribute to the negative regulation of PKC by its R domain. One candidate region that might function to inhibit PKC activity is the pseudoRACK site, which is found in the R domains of different PKC isoforms (30Ron D. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The pseudoRACK site has sequence similarity to receptors for activated PKC (RACKS) that participate in the targeting of different PKC isoforms to selective substrates and is conserved in different PKC isoforms. These pseudoRACK sites are proposed to interact with RACK binding sites which overlap parts of the catalytic domain of PKC and may contribute to enzyme autoinhibition. Recently expression vectors encoding the regulatory domains of different PKC isoforms have been used in transfection studies to assess the roles of PKC in signal transduction. Expression vectors encoding Rα, Rβ1, and Rδ were shown to affect the growth of rat embryo fibroblasts (31Kahn S.M. O'Driscoll K.R. Jiang W. Borner C. Xu D.B. Blackwood M.A. Zhang Y.J. Nomoto K. Weinstein I.B. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2919-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 32Liao L. Ramsay K. Jaken S. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1185-1194PubMed Google Scholar), whereas an expression vector encoding Rε inhibited Golgi functions in mouse fibroblasts (33Lehel C. Olah Z. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1406-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In these studies, the mechanisms by which the R domain proteins exerted their effects were not explored, although they were presumed to act as dominant inhibitors of PKC by interfering with PKC substrate utilization or with interactions of PKC with its binding proteins. As demonstrated here, PKC R domain proteins inhibit substrate phosphorylation with marked specificity through direct effects on the enzyme and possibly through effects associated with sequestration of lipid activators. Although Rα and Rε exhibited only modest PKC isoform selectivity in vitro (Fig. 5), it remains possible that Rα and Rε might behave as isoform-specific inhibitors of PKC in vivo, for example by preventing the translocation of the corresponding PKC isozyme to specific subcellular compartments. Interestingly, Rα and Rε each contain regions corresponding to RACK binding sites that have been shown previously to interfere with the subcellular localization of specific PKC isoforms (23Yedovitzky M.

The crystal structure of the SH2 domains complexed with a 2pY-ITAM peptide suggests that the 60-amino acid-long inter-SH2 spacer helps the SH2 domains to interact with each other to create the binding site for the 2pY-ITAM. To investigate whether the inter-SH2 spacer has additional roles in the whole ZAP-70, we raised antibodies against two peptides of this region and probed ZAP-70 structure under various conditions. We show that the reactivity of antibodies directed at both sequences was dramatically augmented toward the tandem SH2 domains alone compared with that of the entire ZAP-70. This indicates that the conformation of the inter-SH2 spacer is not maintained autonomously but is controlled by sequences C-terminal to the SH2 domains, namely, the linker region and/or the kinase domain. Moreover, antibody binding to the same two determinants was also inhibited when ZAP-70 or the SH2 domains bound to the ζ chain or to a 2pY-ITAM. Together, these two observations suggest a model in which intramolecular contacts keep ZAP-70 in a closed configuration with the two SH2 domains near to each other.

This indicates that the conformation of the inter-SH2 spacer is not maintained autonomously but is controlled by sequences C-terminal to the SH2 domains, namely, the linker region and/or the kinase domain. Moreover, antibody binding to the same two determinants was also inhibited when ZAP-70 or the SH2 domains bound to the ζ chain or to a 2pY-ITAM. Together, these two observations suggest a model in which intramolecular contacts keep ZAP-70 in a closed configuration with the two SH2 domains near to each other. ZAP-70 is a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) 1The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein tyrosine kinase; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; TCR, T-cell antigen receptor; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; SH2, Src homology domain 2; IA, interdomain A; IB, interdomain B; 2pY-ITAM, di-phosphorylated ITAM; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus. essential for the initiation of the signaling cascade activated by T cell antigen receptor triggering (1Qian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 8: 205-212Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Overall, ZAP-70 displays two structurally and functionally distinct moieties, an N-terminal one composed of two SH2 domains and a C-terminal kinase domain tethered by an ∼80-amino acid-long linker (2Chan A.C. Iwashima M. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 71: 649-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar) (also referred to as Interdomain B, (IB); Ref.3Hatada M.H. Lu X. Laird E.R. Green J.

So far, the only known function of the region comprising the two SH2 domains (hereafter indicated as (SH2)2) is to provide a means to recruit ZAP-70 to the plasma membrane by those TCRs engaged with the ligand (4Wange R.L. Malek S.N. Desiderio S. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19797-19801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S.C. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). This is achieved through the coordinated anchorage of the SH2 domains to di-phosphorylated tyrosine-containing motifs (D/E)XXYXX(I/L)X6–8YXX(I/L) called ITAMs (for Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-basedActivation Motifs) present within the cytoplasmic tails of TCR subunits ζ and ε (6Wange R.L.

Thereafter, ZAP-70 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation culminating in the up-regulation of its catalytic activity which in turn is required for phosphorylating cellular substrates (9Wange R.L.

The x-ray crystal structure of the (SH2)2 of human ZAP-70 complexed with a di-phosphorylated ITAM (2pY-ITAM) peptide (3Hatada M.H. Lu X. Laird E.R. Green J. Morgenstern J.P. Lou M. Marr C.S. Phillips T.B. Ram M.K. Theriault K. Zoller M.J. Karas J.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) has revealed an unsuspected structural complementarity and immediate contiguity of the two SH2 domains needed to create a high affinity binding site for the 2pY-ITAM. Thus, while the C-terminal SH2 possesses a binding pocket for the first pY of the ITAM, the corresponding pocket for the second pY in the N-terminal SH2 is contributed, in part, by residues of the C-terminal SH2. Moreover, the 60 amino acids forming the inter-SH2 spacer (hereafter referred to as Interdomain A (IA)) (3Hatada M.H. Lu X. Laird E.R. Green J. Morgenstern J.P. Lou M. Marr C.S. Phillips T.B. Ram M.K. Theriault K. Zoller M.J. Karas J.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) bulges out the SH2 domains and for the most part is structured as a coiled-coil of two antiparallel α-helices which assists in the formation of an interface between the two SH2 domains. It has been speculated that the IA may mediate additional intra- or inter-molecular interactions required for regulating ZAP-70 (3Hatada M.H. Lu X. Laird E.R. Green J. Morgenstern J.P. Lou M. Marr C.S. Phillips T.B. Ram M.K. Theriault K. Zoller M.J. Karas J.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). This idea stems from several considerations. First, coiled-coils are often found to intervene in protein-protein interactions (13Cohen C. Parry D.A.D. Science. 1994; 263: 488-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 14Kohn W.D. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2583-2586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Second, there is at least one highly suggestive example involving the spacer connecting the two SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI 3-kinase). This region, predicted to be a coiled-coil, mediates the interaction with the catalytic p110 subunit (15Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hu Q. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 1993: 5560-5566Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.L. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and occupancy of the two SH2 domains influences the enzymatic activity (17Carpenter C.L. Auger K.R. Chanudhuri M. Yoakim M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3662-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Moreover, binding of singly or doubly phosphorylated peptides to the tandem SH2-containing SH-PTP-2 activates the phosphatase activity (19Puskey S. Wandless T.J. Walsh C.T. Shoelsen S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2897-2900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 20Eck M.J. Atwell S.K. Shoelson S.E. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been reported that the catalytic activity of p72syk, a PTK homologue of ZAP-70, may be increased by binding to a 2pY-ITAM (21Rowley R.B. Burkhardt A.L. Chao H.-G. Matsueda G.R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10498-10502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The latter examples are suggestive of allosteric regulation mediated by the SH2-containing region of the protein. To explore what could be the structural role of the IA in the entire ZAP-70, anti-peptide antibodies directed at this region were generated. The use of these antibodies revealed that binding of ZAP-70 or its isolated (SH2)2 to a 2pY-ITAM or the TCR-ζ chain influences the conformation of the IA. Additional experiments also indicated that conformational constraints are imposed on the IA by the regions of the protein downstream of the (SH2)2. These two observations, in combination, suggest a structural model for the entire ZAP-70. Anti-human ZAP-70 4.06 and 2.06 polyclonal antisera were produced by immunizing rabbits (a total of four, two for each peptide) with the synthetic peptides described in Table I coupled via their C- and N-terminal cysteines (cysteine 117 of ZAP-70), respectively, to maleimide-activated keyhole lympet hemocyanin as recommended (Pierce). A similar procedure was used to generate an anti-ζ antiserum (named zeta-N), which is directed at the first 11 amino acid residues of the human ζ chain. The anti-kinase domain polyclonal antiserum 21.11 has been previously described (23Duplay P. Thome M. Herve F. Acuto O. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).

The generation of the cDNA construct that encodes the amino acids 1–276 of ZAP-70, comprising the SH2(N+C) plus 22 residues of the IB, and the expression vector used (pBJ1) have been previously described (26Qian B.D.

The (SH2)2 molecule was cleaved from the glutathioneS-transferase with factor Xa on a glutathione-Sepharose column during the purification as recommended (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

Open table in a new tab Peptides corresponding to human ZAP-70 sequences 106–117 and 117–130 and to amino acids 1 through 11 of the human TCR ζ chain (an additional cysteine was added to the C terminus of this peptide for coupling to the carrier) purified by high performance liquid chromatography were purchased from Neosystems (Strasbourg, France). Peptides corresponding to the first ITAM of the human TCR ζ chain (ζ1, residues 48–66) plus a 4-amino acid linker at the N terminus (final sequence SGSGNQLYNELNLGRREEYDVLD) were synthesized as mono- (on Tyr62) and di-phosphorylated (on Tyr51 and Tyr62) forms (by F. Baleaux, Dept. of Organic Chemistry, Institut Pasteur, Paris). Peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and in part biotinylated at the N terminus by Biotin sulfo-NHS (Pierce). The purity and the molecular weight of the peptides were confirmed by ion electro-spray ionization mass spectroscopy. For activation, cells were stimulated with anti-TCR mAb 101.5.2 at 1:200 dilution of ascites for 2 min at 37 °C. Unstimulated or TCR-activated cells were solubilized at 108 cells/ml for 15 min in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA in the presence of inhibitors of proteases and phosphatases (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Pefabloc-sc, 50 mm NaF, 10 mmNa4P2O7, and 1 mmNaVO4). Precleared postnuclear lysates were incubated with or without the synthetic ITAM peptides at the indicated concentration for 90 min at 4 °C. After incubation, lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation for 1–2 h with 1 to 5 μl of intact polyclonal antisera preadsorbed to protein A-Sepharose as described (12Mège D. Di Bartolo V. Germain V. Tuosto L. Michel F. Acuto O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32644-32652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In some experiments streptavidin-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were utilized to precipitate ITAM-bound ZAP-70. Similar procedures were employed when purified recombinant ZAP-70 (SH2)2, typically ∼50 ng in 100 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, were reacted with anti-IA antisera and ITAM peptides. After separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and blotting, proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence when the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was used or by 125I-labeled protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in all the other experiments as described previously (12Mège D.

Molecular weight markers, Mark12 MW standards were purchased from Novex. Quantitation of 125I-labeled proteins was performed using ImageQuant software after scanning in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Transfection of Jurkat cells was performed by electroporating (at 260 V, 960 microfarads) 107 Jurkat cells in 0.5 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum in a Gene Pulse cuvette (Bio-Rad) (12Mège D.

Forty h later, transfected cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-TCR mAb for 2 min at 37 °C, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the indicated antisera. Two antisera (named 4.06 and 2.06) were raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the amino acid sequences 106–117 and 117–130 of ZAP-70, respectively (TableI). The peptide segment 106–117 begins shortly after the end of the N-terminal SH2 domain, and together, the two peptides cover ∼40% of the IA (2Chan A.C. Iwashima M. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 71: 649-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 3Hatada M.H. Lu X. Laird E.R. Green J. Morgenstern J.P. Lou M. Marr C.S. Phillips T.B. Ram M.K. Theriault K. Zoller M.J. Karas J.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the two antisera recognized native ZAP-70 and to compare their reactivity with that of other anti-ZAP-70 antisera directed at different regions of the molecule, immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out from lysates of Jurkat cells unstimulated or stimulated with an anti-TCR mAb (Fig. 1). Similarly to 21.11 and ZAP-4 anti-peptide antisera, specific for sequences contained within the kinase domain and the IB, respectively (Table I), 4.06 and 2.06 immunoprecipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated ZAP-70 (Fig. 1,pY-ZAP-70 in lanes 1–8). In this as well as in other experiments, 2.06 was found to be weaker than 4.06 (see also below). However, in striking contrast with the antisera 21.11 and ZAP-4, in TCR-activated Jurkat cells, 4.06 and 2.06 did not show co-immunoprecipitation of phosphorylated ζ chain (cf. pY-ζ in lanes 2 and 4 with lanes 6 and 8). The ζ chain was positively identified by an anti-ζ antiserum (zeta-N, lane 9) which, as expected, in activated Jurkat cells co-immunoprecipitated with ZAP-70. The lack of detection of the ζ chain with both anti-IA antisera was not due to a lower capacity to immunoprecipitate ZAP-70. Indeed, with the anti-IA antisera, ζ was not visible even when the signal of ZAP-70 was similar to that obtained with 21.11 and ZAP-4 (cf. lane 2 with lane 6 or lane 4 with lane 5). In addition, the ζ chain remained undetectable after longer exposure times (not shown). Phosphorylated ZAP-70, not associated to the ζ chain but observable with anti-IA antisera is likely to represent a fraction of the molecules which detached from ζ spontaneously or as a consequence of anti-IA Ab binding. These results suggested that the epitopes recognized by the anti-IA antisera are masked or structurally modified when ZAP-70 is complexed with the ζ chain. The lack of recognition of ZAP-70·ζ complexes by anti-IA Abs could be due to an alteration of the corresponding epitopes consequent to the binding of the SH2 domains to the ITAMs. To directly test this hypothesis, we assessed whether a synthetic peptide corresponding to a 2pY-ITAM inhibited recognition of ZAP-70 by anti-IA Abs. For these experiments, we used a Jurkat cell line named WT15.8, stably expressing ZAP-70 tagged at its C terminus with a VSV sequence (12Mège D. Di Bartolo V. Germain V. Tuosto L. Michel F. Acuto O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32644-32652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The use of tagged ZAP-70 was preferred since the anti-tag antiserum was found to be the strongest, thus allowing sensitive detection of ZAP-70. Cell lysates from unstimulated WT15.8 were incubated with increasing concentrations of mono- (pY) or di- (2pY) phosphorylated ITAM peptides containing a biotin molecule at the N terminus and then reacted with steptavidin-agarose or with the anti-ZAP-70 antisera. In agreement with previous reports (5Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S.C. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), only the 2pY-ITAM was able to bind ZAP-70, as shown by precipitation with streptavidin-agarose (Fig. 2, lanes 12 and 13). Moreover, the 2pY-ITAM, but not the pY-ITAM, inhibited the immunoprecipitation of ZAP-70 with the 4.07 antibody in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, cf. lanes 4, 5 and 6 with lanes 1, 2, and 3). Quantitation of the ZAP-70 band allowed calculation to an ∼90% inhibition of ZAP-70 immunoprecipitation in the presence of 10 μm of 2pY-ITAM. Similar levels of inhibition were obtained when untagged ZAP-70 was immunoprecipitated from Jurkat cells or when non-biotinylated 2pY-ITAM was used. Moreover, similar results were reproduced with 2.06 antiserum (data not shown). This effect was restricted to the anti-IA antibodies since no inhibition was detected with the anti-kinase domain 21.11 (lanes 8 and 9) or with anti-Tag antisera (lanes 10 and 11). From these results, we conclude that the binding of the 2pY-ITAM to ZAP-70 is the event that determines the loss of immunoreactivity. One possible explanation for the above results is that the ITAM itself may sterically hinder the epitopes and prevent antibody binding. However, the three-dimensional structure of the (SH2)2·2pY-ITAM complex (3Hatada M.H. Lu X. Laird E.R. Green J. Morgenstern J.P. Lou M. Marr C.S. Phillips T.B. Ram M.K. Theriault K. Zoller M.J. Karas J.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) shows that both amino acid segments lie on the opposite side of the (SH2)2·2pY-ITAM interface (see also “Discussion”). Moreover, it is difficult to imagine how the two sequences which are part of an extended structure may both be sterically hindered by such a short peptide. Thus, it is extremely unlikely that this mechanism can account for the observed changes in anti-IA Ab reactivity. Another possibility could be that upon ITAM binding, either the kinase domain or the IB or both interact with the IA and induce a conformational change or a masking effect resulting in loss of anti-IA Ab immunoreactivity. Alternatively, this effect may be simply due to a conformational change of the IA induced by 2pY-ITAM binding independently of the rest of the molecule. To discriminate between these two possibilities, experiments similar to those presented in Figs. 1 and 2 were performed using the (SH2)2 moiety of ZAP-70. To this end, Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with a vector expressing the tandem SH2 domains of ZAP-70 (26Qian B.D. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the 4.06 antiserum after TCR-mediated activation or after addition of the 2pY-peptide. Fig. 3 A(top panel) shows that, in cells transfected with (SH2)2 activated with anti-TCR mAb, the TCR-ζ chain (with associated ZAP-70) was detected as a series of strongly phosphorylated bands when immunoprecipitated with the anti-ζ antiserum but remained undetected when using the 4.06 antiserum. However, the (SH2)2 was efficiently immunoprecipitated from the same cells with the 4.06, as shown by stripping and reprobing the blot with this antiserum (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel, lanes 1 and 2). Moreover, as previously demonstrated (26Qian B.D. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the (SH2)2 molecule could be detected in part associated with the TCR-ζ chain. Indeed, in the anti-ζ immunoprecipitation, a band corresponding to a small fraction of the transfected (SH2)2was visible and increased in intensity after activation (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel, lanes 3 and 4). Of note is that in these experiments no tyrosine phosphorylation of the (SH2)2 was detected (the corresponding band migrates as an ∼33-kDa molecular species) even after TCR stimulation. Thus, like intact ZAP-70, the (SH2)2·ζ complex also could not be detected by antibodies directed at the 106–117 IA sequence. This was also verified in an in vitro assay since the 2pY-ITAM, but not the pY-ITAM, could almost completely inhibit the immunoprecipitation of the transfected (SH2)2 with the 4.06 antibody (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were obtained when the (SH2)2 was immunoprecipitated with the 2.06 antisera after incubation with the 2pY-ITAM peptide (data not shown). These experiments indicated that the IB and/or the kinase domain were not implicated in the ITAM-induced inhibition of anti-IA antibodies recognition. However, one could not rule out the possibility that in Jurkat cells a putative protein associated with the IA region upon ITAM binding and produced the inhibitory effect by steric hindrance. Fig. 3 C shows that this explanation is unlikely since addition of 2pY-ITAM, but not pY-ITAM (lanes 3 and 2, respectively), to purified bacterially expressed (SH2)2 of ZAP-70, was sufficient to produce a marked reduction of recognition by 4.06 antibodies. Note that the recombinant protein was able to bind the 2pY-ITAM (lane 5). Together, these data strongly suggest that the loss of anti-IA epitope recognition is essentially due to a conformational change transmitted to the IA region by binding of the ZAP-70 (SH2)2 to a 2pY-ITAM. During the course of the experiments involving the expression of isolated (SH2)2 of ZAP-70 in Jurkat cells, we consistently noted that this molecule was immunoprecipitated by the anti-IA Abs more efficiently than the whole ZAP-70. Experiments were therefore set up to determine the magnitude of this effect and to exclude possible artifacts due to overexpression of the (SH2)2. Thus, Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with different amounts of the expression plasmid containing the (SH2)2 to obtain different (SH2)2/endogenous ZAP-70 ratios. Immunoprecipitations were then carried out with the 4.06 and 2.06 antisera, and the bands corresponding to ZAP-70 and (SH2)2 were quantitated by immunoblotting using 4.06. Before the immunoprecipitation step, an aliquot of the total lysate was used to estimate the relative expression of both molecules. In the experiment shown in Fig. 4 A, endogenous ZAP-70 was expressed at approximately a 10-fold excess compared with the transfected (SH2)2 (see lane 1 and, for quantitation, Experiment I in TableII). If the reactivity of the antisera against the two proteins was the same, then the (SH2)2/ZAP-70 ratio should remain constant in the immunoprecipitate. However, after immunoprecipitation with both 4.06 and 2.06 antisera, a relative increase in the signal of the transfected (SH2)2 over ZAP-70 was clearly evident (Fig. 4 A,lane 2 and 3). Thus, while the amount of (SH2)2 was 10-fold lower than ZAP-70, after immunoprecipitation with 4.06, the signal obtained for the two proteins was nearly the same. This higher reactivity toward the (SH2)2 was even more dramatic for the 2.06 antiserum. This reagent immunoprecipitated ZAP-70 inefficiently compared with 4.06 (cf. lanes 2 and 3) but immunoprecipitated the (SH2)2 as efficiently as 4.06. The magnitude of these modifications in reactivity toward (SH2)2 compared with ZAP-70 can be quantitatively appreciated by confronting the (SH2)2/ZAP-70 signal ratios in the cell lysate and in the immunoprecipitates of 4.06 and 2.06. These ratios are reported in Table II for the experiment shown in Fig. 4 A (Experiment I) and for two additional ones in which higher amounts of (SH2)2 compared with ZAP-70 were expressed. Independently of the initial amounts of (SH2)2and ZAP-70 present, there is an increase of the (SH2)2/ZAP-70 ratio in the immunoprecipitates. It is clear that on average for the epitope recognized by 4.06 Abs there is a gain of reactivity of ∼5-fold, whereas such a change can be estimated to be >100-fold for 2.06 (with this antiserum only, <1% of the total intact ZAP-70 is detected after a single immunoprecipitation). Fig. 4 B also shows, from one of these experiments, a control of the structural intactness of the (SH2)2 versusendogenous ZAP-70. Both proteins were able to bind with similar capacity to the 2pY-ITAM peptide as demonstrated by the fact that their ratio after binding is comparable with the one seen in the total lysate (lane 1). This result excludes that the anti-IA antisera recognize a grossly altered population of (SH2)2 molecules unable to bind to 2pY-ITAM.Table II(SH2)2/ZAP-70 ratios in cell lysates and in anti-IA antisera immunoprecipitatesLysateIP 4.06IP 2.06Experiment I0.10.713.4Experiment II3.012.62-2001Average of three independent immunoprecipitations.ND2-2003ND, not done.Experiment III7.63417292-bAverage of two independent immunoprecipitations.2-2001 Average of three independent immunoprecipitations.2-b Average of two independent immunoprecipitations.2-2003 ND, not done.

https://openalex.org/W2152337502,"A high potential analog of riboflavin with a cyano function at the 8-position was synthesized by employing novel reaction conditions, starting from 8-amino-riboflavin. This was converted to the FAD level with FAD synthetase. The reduced 8-CN-riboflavin, unlike normal reduced flavin, has a distinctive absorption spectrum with two distinctive peaks in the near ultraviolet region. The oxidation-reduction potential of the new flavin was determined to be -50 mV, ∼160 mV more positive than that of normal riboflavin. The 8-CN-riboflavin and 8-CN-FMN were found to be photoreactive and need to be protected from exposure to light. However such complications were not encountered with protein-bound flavins. The apoproteins of flavodoxin and Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) were reconstituted with the 8-CN-FMN and apoDAAO was reconstituted with 8-CN-FAD. Spectral properties of the enzyme-bound neutral and anionic semiquinones were determined from these reconstituted proteins. In the case of 8-CN-FMN-OYE I, it was shown that the comproportionation reaction of a mixture of reduced and oxidized enzyme bound flavin is very rapid, compared with the same reaction with native protein, resulting in ∼100% thermodynamically stable anionic semiquinone. In the case of 8-CN-OYE I, it was shown that the rate of reduction of the enzyme bound flavin by NADPH is ∼40 times faster, and the rate of reoxidation of reduced enzyme bound flavin by oxygen is an order of magnitude slower than with the normal FMN enzyme. This is in accord with the high oxidation-reduction potential of the flavin, which thermodynamically stabilizes the reduced enzyme.

This is in accord with the high oxidation-reduction potential of the flavin, which thermodynamically stabilizes the reduced enzyme. A wide variety of redox transformations in biological systems are catalyzed by flavoenzymes. The oxidation-reduction potential of the flavin and the transfer of electrons by the semiquinone or the fully reduced forms to the acceptor are among the most significant features of the chemistry of flavoprotein catalysis, which is in general controlled by the potential of the flavin. Hence it is possible to regulate and manipulate electron flow during catalysis by altering the redox potential of the flavin. Various structurally modified flavins with altered redox potentials have been synthesized previously and employed as mechanistic probes (1Walsh C. Fisher J. Spencer R. Graham D.W. Ashton W.T.

While deazaflavin derivatives best represent the low potential probes, flavin analogs with various electron withdrawing groups at the 8-position constitute the high potential series. It is known that the introduction of electronegative groups like chlorine (5Lambooy J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18B: 437-444Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), fluorine (6Kasai S. Sugimoto K.

However these functionalities are highly reactive and can undergo displacement reactions either with external nucleophiles or with nucleophilic amino acid residues like cysteine at the active site. Accordingly these properties have been exploited to advantage in determining the solvent accessibility of the 8-position of the flavin in various flavoproteins (9Schopfer L.M. Massey V. Claiborne A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7329-7337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also for the covalent labeling of active site amino acid residues (10Moore E.G. Cardemil E. Massey V. J. Biol.

Although the CN functionality is strongly electronegative, it is resistant to displacement reactions, since these would involve carbon-carbon bond breaking. Also the relatively small size of the CN substitution meets the steric requirements for a good active site probe. Hence various laboratories have attempted the synthesis of 8-CN-flavin nucleotide derivatives by displacement reactions on flavins having leaving groups at the 8-position (e.g. chlorine, fluorine, methylsulfonyl, etc.,) and also by the Sandmeyer reaction on 8-NH2-riboflavin, but without success. Attempts to synthesize the aromatic building block with CN substitution for the construction of the flavin were also a failure. In view of the relevance of this analog as a high potential active site probe for flavoproteins, we decided to reinvestigate the above approaches. The aromatic building block, 3-nitro-4-chloro-6-CN-toluene, which was successfully synthesized, failed to react with ribitylamine. 1Y. V. S. N. Murthy and V. Massey, unpublished results. However, we discovered that 8-NH2-riboflavin can be converted to 8-CN-riboflavin under novel reaction conditions as described in this paper. The riboflavin derivative is readily converted to the FAD and FMN derivatives by the FAD synthetase of Brevibacterium ammoniagenes (14Spencer R. Fisher J. Walsh C. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). 8-NH2-riboflavin, which was synthesized as described previously (15Berezovskii V.M. Tulchinskaya L.S. Polyakova N.A. Zh. Obshch. Khim. 1965; 35: 673-677Google Scholar), was a kind gift from Dr. S. Ghisla, University of Konstanz. Copper(II) cyanide and sodium cyanide were from Aldrich. 8-NH2-FAD was prepared as reported previously (16Ghisla S. Mayhew S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 63: 373-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The holoproteins and apoproteins were prepared as described previously: riboflavin binding protein from hen egg white (17Becvar J. Palmer G. J. Biol.

Thiele D.J. Davio M. Lockridge O. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20720-20724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apoOYE I was prepared from the recombinant enzyme by using the procedure reported for the enzyme from brewers' bottom yeast (21Abramowitz A.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5321-5326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Abramowitz A.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5327-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apoDAAO from pig kidney was obtained from Calzyme (San Luis Obisco, CA). ApoRBP and apoflavodoxin concentrations were determined by titration with pure riboflavin and FMN, respectively. ApoDAAO concentration was determined by titrating pure FAD with apoprotein in the presence of benzoate (23Massey V. Curti B. Ganther H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2347-2357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reconstitution of the apoproteins with 8-CN-flavins was accomplished by mixing 1.5-fold excess of the flavin with apoprotein and incubating on ice for 3 h. Excess flavin was removed by a Centricon-30 microconcentrator (Amicon). 10 mg of 8-amino-riboflavin was suspended in 3 ml of water in a test tube. To this suspension, 6n HCl was added until a clear solution was obtained. This solution was cooled to 0 °C on ice, and three aliquots each of 40 μl of saturated sodium nitrite solution were added with continuous shaking of the test tube. After 5 min, 300 μl of saturated urea solution was added to destroy the excess sodium nitrite. The cold diazo salt solution was then added with a glass transfer pipette to a 10-ml saturated solution of NaCN + CuCN (70:30) in a 50-ml glass beaker with vigorous stirring at room temperature. After 20 min, the reaction mixture was loaded on a 20-cc C-18 Sep-Pak (Millipore, Milford, CT) cartridge. The cartridge was prewashed thoroughly with excess water, methanol, and again with water before loading the reaction mixture. The Sep-Pak cartridge was eluted with water followed by 5% acetonitrile to remove salts and a red band of unknown structure. Elution with 15% acetonitrile gave the 8-CN-riboflavin and with 20% acetonitrile gave 8-chlororiboflavin. Evaporation of the flavin solutions with a Speed Vac concentrator gave 6 mg of the 8-CN-riboflavin as a yellow powder. 8-CN-riboflavin was converted to the FAD level with partially purified FAD synthetase from B. ammoniagenes by incubating the flavin in 0.002 m potassium Pi, pH 7.5 at 25 °C, following the procedure of Spencer et al. (14Spencer R. Fisher J. Walsh C. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). After 14 h, HPLC analysis of the incubation mixture showed 100% conversion to the FAD form. The reaction mixture was loaded on to the prewashed (as described in the case of 8-CN-riboflavin) 20-cc C-18 Sep-Pak cartridge and eluted with 100 ml of water to wash off salts and breakdown products from ATP. Elution with 5% acetonitrile in water gave pure flavin, which was concentrated on a Speed Vac concentrator to obtain 8-CN-FAD as a yellow powder. 8-CN-FMN was obtained by hydrolysis of the FAD in 0.05 m potassium Pi, pH 7, with snake venom phosphodiesterase (Naja naja venom). To 500 μl of 8-NH2-FAD, 100 μl of 6 n HCl was added at ice temperature. Then two 20-μl aliquots of saturated NaNO2were added with mixing. After 2 min, 100 μl of saturated urea solution was added. When effervescence stopped, 500 μl of a saturated solution of 70:30 NaCN + CuCN solution was added into the diazo-FAD solution at room temperature. After 3–5 min, the solution was passed through a prewashed small Sep-Pak cartridge, and the salts were washed off with water. The flavin was then eluted with 5% acetonitrile. HPLC analysis of the 5% acetonitrile fraction showed both 8-CN-FAD (∼80%) and 8-CN-FMN (∼20%) when eluted with 80% 0.01m potassium Pi, pH 6, and 20% methanol on a reverse phase C-18 column. Interestingly, no formation of 8-chloro-FAD or 8-chloro-FMN was observed. Old Yellow Enzyme activities were measured in 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.0 at 25°, in a stopped flow spectrophotometer (Kinetic Instruments, Ann Arbor, MI) either under anaerobic conditions (when cyclohexenone was employed as electron acceptor) or under controlled oxygen concentrations when oxygen was electron acceptor, monitoring both the consumption of NADPH at 340 nm and in the same experiments the level of flavin oxidation/reduction at 470 nm. The concentrations of both NADPH and the acceptor (cyclohexenone or O2) were varied systematically to determine true kcat and Km values. Attempts to convert the 8-diazo salts of flavins to 8-CN-flavins by the Sandmeyer reaction were unsuccessful. The choice of the cyanylating reagent has a critical effect on the course of the reaction (24Hodgson H.H. Heyworth F. J. Chem. Soc. 1949; : 1131-113?Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 25Suzuki N. Azuma T. Kaneko Y. Izawa Y. Tomioka H.J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1987; 645 (and references therein)Google Scholar). For the 8-diazo-flavins, in our hands, either sodium cyanide or cuprous cyanide alone were ineffective. Lately several copper-cyano complexes of the kind Na3(Cu(CN)4), K3(Cu(CN)4), K2(Cu(CN)4·NH3) were shown to have large advantages in cyanylation reactions affording high yields of nitriles (26Yonezawa N. Hino T. Namie T. Katakai R. Synth. Commun. 1996; 26: 1575-1578Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Before trying these complexes for the present cyanylation, we tried treating the diazoflavin with a saturated solution of an approximately 3:1 mixture NaCN + CuCN and found 8-CN-riboflavin in about 60% yield (SchemeFS1). The 8-chlororiboflavin was obtained as a side product in about 20% yield, presumably because of the CuCl formed from CuCN and HCl. It was found that the ratio between NaCN and CuCN is crucial for both the reaction to occur as well as to obtain isolatable yields of the cyanoflavin. When the CuCN ratio was increased, an insoluble solid was obtained with no isolation of any flavin. The λmax of the UV-visible spectrum for 8-CN-riboflavin is slightly shifted from 445 nm for the normal flavin spectrum to 456 nm. The near-UV peak is shifted from 375 nm for the normal flavin to 338 nm for 8-CN-riboflavin (Fig. 1 A). The cyanoflavin is fluorescent with an emission maximum at 530 nm and excitation maxima at 338 and 456 nm, identical with the absorption spectrum. Further characterization of the new flavin was made by recording the positive ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrum which showed M+1 at 388 (Fig. 1 B) (molecular weight of the 8-CN-riboflavin is 387) and also by the 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 1 C). In the proton NMR spectrum, the electron-deficient nature of the flavin is well evident from the fact that the C6 and C9 protons are down-shifted and well separated due to the CN substitution in the benzene ring. The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 8.4 ppm compared with 7.9 and 8.0 ppm in the normal flavin. The lone methyl group on the C7 is seen as a singlet at 2.6 ppm, down-shifted from 2.3 ppm in normal flavin. The rest of protons from the ribityl side chain are recorded between 3.6 and 4.8 ppm. The 8-CN-riboflavin was converted to the FAD level by reacting with FAD synthetase from B. ammoniagenes in 100% yield without any complications. This again reaffirms the fact that the small cyano substitution meets the steric requirements of the 8-position of the flavin. The 8-CN-FMN was obtained by hydrolysis of the HPLC-pure 8-CN-FAD with the phosphodiesterase from snake venom. This reaction is accompanied by an increase in extinction for the FMN at 456 nm of 8.8% and with a 10.25-fold increase in fluorescence. The cyanylation reaction also worked with the 8-NH2-FAD, except that about 20% of the FAD got hydrolyzed to 8-CN-FMN because of the drastic acidic conditions of the diazotization reaction. It was found that the reduction of 8-CN-riboflavin to its dihydro form can be accomplished with several reducing agents such as dithiothreitol, dithionite, NaBH4, photochemically with EDTA as photodonor, NADPH, and NADH. The reduction is fully reversible with oxygen. However the spectrum for reduced 8-CN-riboflavin is different from that of normal flavin, as reported previously for 8-CN-7-nor-3-methyl-lumiflavin by Bruice et al. (13Bruice T. Chan T.W. Taulane J.P. Yokoe I. Elliott D.L. Williams R.F. Novak M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 6713-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Reduced 8-CN-riboflavin has two well defined peaks above the 300 nm region with maxima at 312 and 372 nm at pH 7 and at 316 and 362 nm under acidic conditions(Fig. 1 A). The pKa value of the reduced cyanoflavin was determined to be at pH 5.6 from the change in absorption spectrum with pH (Fig. 1 A, inset). Hence the electronegative 8-CN-group decreases the pKa of the reduced flavin from the usual value (27Bruice T.C. Prog. Bioorg. Chem. 1976; 4: 1-84Google Scholar) of ∼6.7 to 5.6 in accord with the electron-deficient nature of the flavin. The spectra of the neutral and anionic reduced forms are shown in Fig. 1 A. The reduction-oxidation potential for 8-CN-FAD was measured by using the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system and indigo tetrasulfonate as the reference dye (28Massey V. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1990. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1991: 59-66Crossref Google Scholar). Reduction of the 8-CN-FAD with the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system proceeded with isosbestic points at 352 and 406 nm and the reduction of the dye with isosbestic points at 338 and 502 nm. These wavelengths were used to monitor the reduction of the components in a mixture of the two. A plot of log(ox/red) of the dye against log(ox/red) of the flavin gave a midpoint potential for 8-CN-FAD of −50 mV, which is 158 mV more positive than that of normal flavin. This is in accord with the strongly electron withdrawing nature of the CN substituent, making it a more electron deficient system, shifting the potential to more positive values. Native flavin is known to form an N-5 adduct with sulfite, but the reaction is only half completed at saturating sulfite concentrations because of the high dissociation constant (∼2.5 m) (29Müller F. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4007-4016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absorption spectrum of the flavin adduct is similar to that of reduced flavin with a new peak maximal at 320 nm. With a series of artificial flavins a good correlation was found to exist between the dissociation constant of the flavin-sulfite adduct and the two-electron redox potential of the flavin (29Müller F. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4007-4016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The straight line obtained by plotting the logarithm of the dissociation constants of the complexes and the redox potentials of the flavins shows that the more positive the potential, the tighter the sulfite binding. It is reasonable that flavins with more positive potentials are the most electron deficient and prone for the addition of two electrons through adduct formation. As anticipated, the cyanoflavin formed a tight complex with sulfite, with a Kd of 0.73 mm (Fig. 2, inset). The absorption spectrum of the adduct has a peak in the near-UV region at 310 nm (Fig. 2), similar to that with normal flavin and distinctively different from that of reduced 8-CN-flavin. From the previously observed correlation of the redox potential and Kd for the complex (29Müller F. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4007-4016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the oxidation-reduction potential at pH 7 would be predicted to be −50 mV, in perfect agreement with direct measurement. The hydrolysis of 8-CN-riboflavin in 0.5 m carbonate, pH 10.25, was studied. The spectral changes that were observed are similar to those of the cyanoisoalloxazine observed by Bruiceet al. (13Bruice T. Chan T.W. Taulane J.P. Yokoe I. Elliott D.L. Williams R.F. Novak M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 6713-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and compatible with formation of a spirohydantoin (30Dudley K.H. Hemmerich P. J. Org. Chem. 1967; 32: 3049-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As is the case with the cyanoisoalloxazine derivative, repetitive spectral scans during the hydrolysis failed to provide any evidence for the 10a- or 4a-hydroxyl adducts, which were considered as possible intermediate species during hydrolysis. It is well known that flavins are photoreactive and their spectroscopic and photochemical properties have been the subject of intense studies (31Heelis P.F. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. I. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 171-194Google Scholar). It was found that 8-CN-riboflavin is highly photoreactive. When a sample of the flavin was left exposed to room light, it was transformed over a period of a few days into a stable product with absorbance maxima at 320 and 388 nm. A similar reaction was also observed with the 8-CN-FMN derivative. However when 8-CN-FAD was exposed under the same conditions, it was found to be extremely stable toward photoreaction. Only about 5% of the reaction was observed in the same time scale where 8-CN-riboflavin and 8-CN-FMN reacted completely. It is known that FAD forms an intramolecular complex between the adenine moiety and the isoalloxazine ring (32Weber G. Biochem. J. 1950; 47: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The increased stability of FAD toward photolysis is attributed to this intramolecular stacking (33Miles D.W. Urry D.W. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 2791-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The photoreaction involves the ribityl side chain, since 8-CN-lumiflavin is completely stable under the same conditions. The nature of the product and the chemistry of the photoreaction is under investigation and will be reported separately. Although this protein has no known catalytic activity, binding experiments of artificial flavins with this protein are useful in interpreting the structural characteristics of the flavin. Riboflavin binds to apoRBP with a dissociation constant of 1.3 nmand shows considerable spectral shifts and resolution on binding (17Becvar J. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5607-5617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 8-CN-riboflavin showed similar spectral changes to those of normal flavin upon binding to apoRBP. The flavin absorption peaks are red shifted from 340 and 454 nm to 344 and 470 nm with a decrease in the extinction for both peaks. The binding of 8-CN-riboflavin to apoRBP resulted in the complete quenching of the fluorescence. The dissociation constant was calculated to be ∼0.27 μm and by standardization of apoprotein with native riboflavin, the extinction coefficient of the 8-CN-riboflavin was determined as 10,400m−1 cm−1. The 5-deazaflavin-catalyzed photoreduction (34Massey V. Hemmerich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5612-5614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of 8-CN-riboflavin-RBP proceeded to the fully reduced form without stabilizing any semiquinone. The spectrum for the reduced protein-bound flavin is almost identical to that of the free reduced flavin except that the λmax is slightly red shifted by 4 nm to 376 nm. The initial oxidized flavin spectrum is regained rapidly on admission of air. 8-CN-FMN binds to apoflavodoxin with quenching of the fluorescence and with a dissociation constant of ∼0.45 μm. The binding of the flavin to the apoprotein results in 14% decrease in the extinction and the maxima of the absorption spectrum shift from 340 and 452 nm for the free flavin to 342 and 460 nm (ε460 = 9.4 mm−1 cm−1) for the bound flavin. The extinction coefficient for 8-CN-FMN was determined as 11,000m−1 cm−1 by standardizing the apoprotein with pure native FMN. Reduction of native flavodoxin by EDTA/light or with the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system proceeds to the fully reduced protein through the formation of neutral semiquinone (35Massey V. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3181-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The same reduction process occurs with all flavodoxins substituted with artificial flavins, including 8-CN-FMN flavodoxin (Fig. 3). The blue neutral semiquinone shows maxima at 598 and 644 nm. Previous studies with native flavodoxin showed essentially quantitative formation of the neutral semiquinone at the midpoint of dithionite reduction (36Mayhew S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 235: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, in case of the 8-CN-FMN-protein the plot of A458 versus A644 (see the inset in Fig. 3) shows that only ∼75% of the radical species was formed. This suggests that the potentials of the EFlox/EFlH⋅and EFlH⋅/EFlred (where Fl is flavin) couples are closer than those of the native flavoprotein. The reduced flavoprotein showed two well resolved peaks in the absorption spectrum similar to the unbound reduced flavin. However the peak in the near-UV region shifted further to the lower wavelength region and the band at 370 nm in the free flavin showed a bathochromic shift to 388 nm. Interestingly, 25% of the absorption at the 460 nm region is retained with a shifted absorption band at 485 nm (Fig. 3). There is no adduct formation with sulfite in accordance with studies of the native protein (37Massey V. Müller F. Feldberg R. Schuman M. Sullivan P.A. Howell G.L. Mayhew S.G. Matthews R.G. Foust G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3999-4006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Old Yellow Enzyme is the first discovered flavoprotein and was isolated from brewers' bottom yeast. It is a mixture of homodimers and a heterodimer with one FMN per subunit, products of separate genes (38Schopfer L.M. Massey V. Kuby S.A. A Study of Enzymes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 247-283Google Scholar,39Stott K. Saito K. Thiele D.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6097-6106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the physiological role of this protein is yet to be determined, structural and chemical reactivity studies in the direction of elucidating its function are the subject of extensive studies in this laboratory. Saito et al. (20Saito K. Thiele D.J. Davio M. Lockridge O. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20720-20724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cloned a gene encoding an isoform of OYE (OYE I) from Saccharomyces carlsbergenesis, and its crystal structure has been determined (40Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). For the present investigations, this recombinant enzyme (OYE I) was used. The binding of apoOYE with 8-CN-FMN was followed by measuring the flavin fluorescence as well as changes in absorption spectrum. At the end point, the fluorescence was quenched almost completely with a residual intensity of ∼6% of that of the free flavin. The titration plots suggested a binding affinity of the 8-CN-FMN to apoOYE similar to that with FMN (Kd ∼ 10−9m) (41Theorell H. Nygaard A.P. Acta. Chem. Scand. 1954; 8: 877-888Crossref Google Scholar). The extinction coefficient of the cyano-FMN was determined as 11,000 m−1 cm−1 by standardizing the apoprotein with pure native FMN. The binding was accompanied by the usual resolution and the characteristic spectral shifts of the flavin spectrum found with the native FMN. The λmax for the free flavin to protein-bound flavin shifted from 340 and 454 nm to 348 and 470 nm, with the ε470 value of 10,200m−1 cm−1. The oxidized form of OYE binds to a variety of ligands forming spectroscopically distinct complexes (38Schopfer L.M. Massey V. Kuby S.A. A Study of Enzymes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 247-283Google Scholar). Phenols are the most striking and well studied as they result in long wavelength charge transfer bands in the region 500–800 nm accompanied by strong perturbation in the flavin-visible absorption bands (21Abramowitz A.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5321-5326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Abramowitz A.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5327-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown by a positive correlation between the energy of the charge transfer transition and the Hammett para constant that the phenol is the charge transfer donor and the oxidized flavin of the enzyme is the acceptor (22Abramowitz A.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5327-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A good correlation was also shown to exist between the redox potential of the flavin and the maximum of the long wavelength transition, from studies where the native flavin was replaced by a variety of synthetic flavin analogs of different oxidation-reduction potential (22Abramowitz A.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5327-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

The structures show excellent agreement and reveal a structure with approximate dimensions of 195 (length) × 135 (width) and 130 Å (depth) with an internal funnel-shaped cavity. The structure shows that a chisel-shaped body is connected to a broad base at the opposing end by four stands. Four approximately 45 Å diameter large openings in the body of the structure result in a central cavity that is more accessible to the proteinase than those associated with the native or fully transformed structures. The dissimilarity in the shapes between the two ends of α2M half-transformed and the similarity between its chisel-shaped body and that of native α2M indicate that the chymotrypsin has cleaved both bait regions in the bottom-half of the structure. Consequently, its functional division lies on the minor axis. The structural organization is in accord with biochemical studies, which show that the half-transformed α2M migrates on native polyacrylamide gels at a rate intermediate to the native and fully transformed α2M and is capable of trapping 1 mol of proteinase. Even though its upper portion is similar to the native molecule, significant differences in their shapes are apparent and these differences may be related to its slower reaction with a proteinase than the native structure. These structural comparisons further support the view that the transformation of α2M involves an untwisting of its strands with an opening of the cavity for entrance of the proteinase and a retwisting of the strands around the proteinase resulting in its encapsulation.

J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-111542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human α2-macroglobulin (α2M), 1The abbreviations used are: α2M, native α2-macroglobulin; α2M-HT, half-transformed α2-macroglobulin; α2M-MA, α2-macroglobulin-methylamine; ice, frozen-hydrated; stain, methylamine tungstate. 1The abbreviations used are: α2M, native α2-macroglobulin; α2M-HT, half-transformed α2-macroglobulin; α2M-MA, α2-macroglobulin-methylamine; ice, frozen-hydrated; stain, methylamine tungstate. the largest known proteinase inhibitor (Mr = 720,000), is a homotetramer formed by two protomeric units, each of which contains two 180-kDa subunits linked by two disulfide bonds. It has a vital role in the clearance of proteinases from the circulation and in regulating their activity in fibrinolysis, coagulation, and complement activation (2Starkey P.M. Barrett A.J. Barrett A.J. Proteinases in Mammalian Cells and Tissues. Elsevier-North Holland, Amsterdam1977: 663-696Google Scholar,3Vlaicu R. Rus H.G. Niculescu F. Cristae A. Atherosclerosis. 1985; 55: 35-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A single α2M molecule can entrap two proteinase molecules such as chymotrypsin and trypsin and can therefore be considered to contain two functional domains (1Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-111542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each subunit of α2M has a bait region with cleavage sites for nearly all known endoproteinases and an internal thiol ester bond. A proteinase cleaves the two bait regions within both functional units, leading to an activation and cleavage of the thiol ester bonds. Consequently, α2M undergoes a major structural change resulting in entrapment of the proteinase and its covalent linkage to the molecule (1Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-111542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sottrup-Jensen L. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. FEBS Lett. 1981; 128: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The bound proteinase, although inaccessible to proteins, may react with small substrates and inhibitors (2Starkey P.M. Barrett A.J. Barrett A.J. Proteinases in Mammalian Cells and Tissues. Elsevier-North Holland, Amsterdam1977: 663-696Google Scholar), which is in contrast to the mode of inhibition of all other natural proteinase inhibitors that bind at the proteinase's active site. Treating α2M with a small nucleophile such as methylamine also causes cleavage of the thiol ester bonds, leading to a structural transformation of the molecule (1Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-111542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electron microscopy reconstructions have shown that the methylamine-transformed α2M (α2M-MA) has a similar structure to the α2M-proteinase complex (5Schroeter J.P. Kolodziej S.J. Wagenknecht T.

The remarkable structural rearrangement of α2M has been the subject of numerous electron microscopy studies (6Delain E. Pochon F. Barray M. Van Leuven F. Electron Microsc.

These results, as well as other physicochemical studies (2Starkey P.M. Barrett A.J. Barrett A.J. Proteinases in Mammalian Cells and Tissues. Elsevier-North Holland, Amsterdam1977: 663-696Google Scholar), have shown that the native and transformed molecules have significantly different structures. The native structure is more globular, with dense end regions that are connected by twisted strands (7Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 8Boisset N. Taveau J.-C. Pochon F. Lamy J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25762-25769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The transformed structure has a more compact central region of protein with four arms extending from its sides, similar to the letter “H” (5Schroeter J.P. Kolodziej S.J. Wagenknecht T.

The trapped proteinases are located in an internal cavity, symmetrically above and below the minor axis of the transformed molecule (5Schroeter J.P. Kolodziej S.J. Wagenknecht T. Bretaudiere J.-P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25133-25141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), conflicting proposals have been advanced for the transformation of α2M. It was proposed that a lateral compression and unfolding mechanism links α2M and α2M-MA (8Boisset N. Taveau J.-C. Pochon F. Lamy J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25762-25769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the observation that the native and transformed structures are constituted of two twisted, side-by-side strands of opposite handedness has led to the proposal that an unwinding and rewinding of these constituent strands leads to proteinase entrapment (7Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). α2M-half transformed (α2M-HT) provides a plausible structural link between the native and transformed structures. This intermediate structure was obtained by reacting the native molecule with chymotrypsin covalently bound to Sepharose (11Gettins P.G. W Crews B.C. Cunningham L.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5613-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Two bait regions and two thiol ester linkages are cleaved within this homotetrameric structure, and the proteinase is not bound. α2M-HT reacts with and traps a proteinase by cleavage of the remaining bait regions at a slower rate than the native structure. Its rate of migration on nondenaturing gels is intermediate between α2M and α2M-MA (11Gettins P.G. W Crews B.C. Cunningham L.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5613-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this study, the three-dimensional structures of α2M-HT, obtained from negative stain and frozen-hydrated specimens, are compared and show excellent concordance indicating that the molecule is well preserved by both methods and that the reconstructions are reliable. Comparisons of the structure of α2M-HT with the native and transformed structures were investigated to further understand the mechanism of its structural rearrangement and identify the functional division in native α2M. Half-transformed α2M was prepared by reaction of human plasma α2M with chymotrypsin-Sepharose. Chymotrypsin-Sepharose was prepared by extensive washing with 50 mm Hepes, 100 mmNaCl, and 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). Approximately 5 g (wet weight) of the chymotrypsin-Sepharose was incubated with 40 mg of plasma α2M in a total volume of 12 ml. The suspension was gently rocked at room temperature, and the progress of the reaction was monitored by assaying for remaining intact thiol esters. After 5 h, the chymotrypsin-Sepharose was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. Iodoacetamide (10 mm) was added to react with the free SH groups generated, and the protein was then dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). After gel filtration on Sephadex G150, the α2M-HT was shown to contain two cleaved and two intact bait regions as well as two intact and two cleaved thiol esters as described previously (11Gettins P.G. W Crews B.C. Cunningham L.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5613-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, no chymotrypsin activity is associated with the α2M, and the molecule is active, since it traps one molecule of chymotrypsin (11Gettins P.G. W Crews B.C. Cunningham L.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5613-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). α2M-HT (5 μg/ml) in 0.05 mm sodium phosphate with 10 μg/ml bacitracin and 0.25% methylamine tungstate (pH 7.2) was applied by the spray method to carbon films (12Stoops J.K. Momany C. Oliver R.M. Schroeter J.P. Bretaudiere J.-P. Hackert M.L. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1991; 18: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Stain images were acquired with a JEOL JEM 1200 electron microscope operating at 100 kV using conventional irradiation procedures. The 50°-tilted images were recorded with an underfocus of ∼1.0 μm at the center of the stage, and the corresponding untilted images were obtained at 0.5 μm underfocus. For cryo-electron microscopy, a 3-μl sample of α2M-HT (0.1 mg/ml, in 10 mm citrate (pH 6.0), was deposited on a glow-discharged, carbon-coated holey grid, and the excess removed by blotting with filter paper. The grid was then rapidly cooled in liquid ethane. Specimens were kept below −170 °C in a Gatan cold holder, and images were recorded at 1.7 μm underfocus at an exposure of ∼9e/Å2 using Kodak SO 163 film. Diffraction patterns from the micrographs were examined on an optical bench (5Schroeter J.P. Kolodziej S.J. Wagenknecht T. Bretaudiere J.-P. Bretaudiere J.T. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K J. Struct. Biol. 1992; 109: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and micrographs showing astigmatism, motion, and drift were rejected. The remaining micrographs were digitized with an Eikonix 1142 scanner with 12-bit dynamic range using a pixel size of 5.8 Å on the specimen scale. The digitized micrographs were again subjected to power spectrum analysis and re-examined for astigmatism and drift. The micrographs of 50°-tilted specimens were utilized in a useful range of underfocus values so that the first zero in the contrast transfer function of the electron microscope occurs between 12 and 25 Å. The SUPRIM image processing software (13Schroeter J.P. Bretaudiere J.-P. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was used for initial particle picking and processing on Silicon Graphics Iris and Indigo2 workstations. The untilted micrographs were used to select the characteristic “pseudo-lip” views of α2M-HT (see Fig. 1, a–c and k–m) in 64 × 64-pixel boxes. The corresponding tilted views were obtained by matching the tilted and untilted micrographs with 30–50 corresponding fiducial points. The tilted particles were hand-centered, where needed, and then extracted. The entire set of 0° pseudo-lip views was subject to a reference-free alignment (14Penczek P. Radermacher M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) using the SPIDER software (15Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjaj M. Leith A. J. Struct.

Tapon-Bretaudiere J. Stoops J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Clusters best corresponding to the pseudo-lip shape were selected. A final data set of 50°-tilted particles (1640 images) was used in a random conical tilt reconstruction (17Radermacher M. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1988; 9: 359-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The resolution of this reconstruction was 41 Å as measured by the Fourier Shell Correlation (18Saxton W.O. Baumeister W. J. Microsc. (Oxf .). 1982; 127: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) with a Fourier ring criterion of 0.67 (19Unser M. Trus B.L. Stevens A.C. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 23: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This model was refined using a three-dimensional projection alignment method (20Penczek P.A. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1994; 53: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) employing the tilted particles (resolution = 38Å). The approach developed by Kolodziej et al.(21Kolodziej S.J. Penczek P.A. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 120: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using three-dimensional projection alignment and iterative reconstruction (20Penczek P.A. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1994; 53: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) was employed to compute the structure from stain and ice images. A set of quasi-uniformly distributed reference projections (20Penczek P.A. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1994; 53: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 21Kolodziej S.J.

The stain and frozen-hydrated images consisted of 4750 and 2233 particles, respectively, from the untilted specimens. Two passes of refinement achieved a stable resolution value. The structures were Fermi-filtered using zero for the temperature (22Frank J. Verschoor A. Wagenknecht T. Wu T.T. New Methodologies in Studies of Protein Conformation. Van Nostrand Rhinehold Co. Inc., New York1985: 36-86Google Scholar) to the resolution value of the reconstruction and the frozen-hydrated reconstruction was corrected for the contrast transfer function of the electron microscope (23Erickson H.P. Klug A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1971; 261: 105-118Crossref Google Scholar, 24Toyoshima C. Unwin N.

Both stain and ice structures were displayed as solid surface models using SUPRIM and subsequently rendered using the Explorer software for SGI workstations (version 3.5, NAG Inc., Downer's Grove, IL). The images were printed using a Mitsubishi S3600–3OU dye sublimation printer. A gallery of stain and ice images of α2M-HT shows pseudo-lip views (Fig. 1, a–c and k–m, respectively), which exhibit similarity to the “lip” views of native α2M. These oval-shaped images have small triangular and rounded shapes of higher protein density at opposing ends connected by two curved strands. These are in contrast to a similar arrangement of two small triangular shapes of higher protein density in the lip view of the native molecule (7Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 8Boisset N. Taveau J.-C. Pochon F. Lamy J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25762-25769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Pseudo-lips with various in-plane rotations in the untilted micrographs interconverted into a variety of other shapes upon tilting the microscope stage 50° (data not shown). By observing these conversions, other orientations of α2M-HT were identified in the untilted stain and ice images and subsequently used for the refinement of the initial random conical tilt reconstruction using the three-dimensional projection alignment (20Penczek P.A. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1994; 53: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 21Kolodziej S.J. Penczek P.A. Stoops J.K. J. Struct.

It is interesting to note that none of these images resemble the single particle images of the binary chymotrypsin α2M complex (26Figler N.L. Strickland D.K. Allietta M. Gonias S.L. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 106: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This difference may result from the secondary reaction of the trapped proteinase with the remaining uncleaved α2M subunits in the binary complex preparation (11Gettins P.G. W Crews B.C. Cunningham L.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5613-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 27Strickland D.K. Steiner J.P. Migliorini M. Battey F.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1458-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the present study, the α2M-HT preparation was found to contain two free thiols and thiol ester moieties per molecule when the electron microscopy images were recorded. Images of α2M-HT molecules in methylamine tungstate stain are very similar to their corresponding views in vitreous ice, indicating that the molecular architecture is faithfully reproduced by the stain (Fig. 1). The Euler angle distribution plot of the projection directions for the untilted stain specimens exhibits an isotropic distribution of views showing that the molecules do not assume a preferred orientation in stain on the carbon film (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the ice images show a tendency to cluster about the θ axis and therefore under-represent the end views of the molecule (Fig. 2 B). Accordingly, the easily recognizable pseudo lip images were used in the initial stain random conical tilt reconstruction (41-Å resolution), and this structure served as a model to align the nontilted stain images in multiple orientations using the three-dimensional projection alignment method as described previously (20Penczek P.A. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1994; 53: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 21Kolodziej S.J. Penczek P.A. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 120: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The wide distribution of projection angles (Fig. 2 A) ensures a reconstruction with more uniform resolution than the random conical tilt structure. Using the previous structure as a model, iterations of refinement were carried out until a stable resolution value was achieved (32 Å, Fig. 3). The frozen-hydrated images were aligned using the random conical tilt stain structure as a model, and further refinement was achieved using the resulting ice structure as the model (34-Å resolution). An ice reconstruction using the refined stain model was similar, and the resolution was not improved. The random conical tilt structure is significantly narrower than the refined stain and ice structures (height-width ratios of 1.5 and 1.6, respectively), and the vertical strand across the front of the random conical tilt structure is incomplete (Fig. 3). These differences may be related to the “missing cone” of information associated with the random conical tilt structure (17Radermacher M. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1988; 9: 359-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The stain and ice structures, their projections and the corresponding average images show good concordance (Fig. 3). Comparisons of the protein density distribution between 5.8-Å-thick slices of the stain and ice structures also show good agreement (Fig. 4). It is interesting that the less robust features associated with the central slices (8Boisset N. Taveau J.-C. Pochon F. Lamy J. J. Biol.

A. 1988; 85: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) in the stain and ice structures have similar densities. This contrasts with a comparison of the stain and ice structures of the Saccharomyces cerevisae fatty acid synthase where the stain was found to enhance the less robust features (21Kolodziej S.J. Penczek P.A. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 120: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The agreement obtained in the present comparisons indicates that the architecture of α2M-HT has been faithfully reproduced by both methods of imaging the molecule and that the reconstructions are reliable. Stereo views of the stain structure show an oval-shaped structure (195 height × 130 width × 137 Å depth) with four large openings ∼45 Å in diameter leading into an internal cavity (Fig. 5). The top of the structure is chisel-shaped, whereas its bottom is broad and bulbous. The two ends of the structure are joined by four strands (Fig. 5) whose protein densities are considerably diminished from those associated with its two ends (Fig. 4). The variability between the size and density of the strands and different shapes of the two ends results in a structure that lacks symmetry. The absence of 2-fold symmetry on the major axis of the structure was unexpected, since it is not apparent in the particle images (Fig. 1). It is possible that this minor asymmetry is introduced during sample preparation or is exaggerated by image processing. The following considerations lead us to believe it is a valid structural feature of the molecule. As indicated above, the preparation of α2M-HT has two intact thiol esters moieties and is functional, since it traps one molecule of proteinase (11Gettins P.G. W Crews B.C. Cunningham L.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5613-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that chymotrypsin-Sepharose cleavage is specific for the bait region (11Gettins P.G. W Crews B.C. Cunningham L.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5613-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The oblique side view average images in Fig. 3 also exhibit this asymmetry and the projections of the structure in 15° angular bins agree well with the average images from the candidates assigned to these bins by the three-dimensional projection alignment method (data not shown). Finally, a refinement using a random conical tilt model with 2-fold symmetry imposed on its major axis gave a structure similar to that shown in Fig. 5 (data not shown). These results indicate that the data set is self-consistent and further support our proposal that the reconstructions are reliable. A threshold level that doubled the volume of the structure resulted in a global swelling but revealed no additional features. The protein density distributions in serial slices 5.8 Å thick cut normal to the major axes of the structures show the variation in the central portion (body) of the molecules (Fig. 6). In this figure, the native and half-transformed structures are aligned so that the tops of the chisel-shaped bodies are in the same orientation and the strands associated with the native and α2M-MA structures are oriented in corresponding positions in slice 12. In the native structure, the strands at the top and bottom (slices 1–5 and 20–25, respectively) are joined; they separate on either side of its middle (slices 6–9 and 15–18) to form two openings to the cavity approximately 25 Å in diameter. As the strands course through the body of the structure, they exhibit a 90° clockwise twist. The strands associated with the chisel-shaped body of the α2M-HT structure are significantly larger than they are in the native molecule (slices 1–6), and they separate into four lower density, thin strands in the body of the structure (slices 7–18) and coalesce into a broad oval-shaped body at the base of the molecule (slices 19–24). Significantly, the strands exhibit little rotation through the structure's body, and the four openings are approximately two times larger than those associated with the native molecule. The α2M-MA structure (fully transformed) consists of four higher density filaments which are joined by protein of lower density to form a pair of strands. The two strands that traverse the fully transformed structure twist 90° with a handedness opposite to that of the native structure and form external grooves. The major top-bottom asymmetry associated with the α2M-HT structure and the similarity between the chisel-shaped body at its top with that of the native structure suggest that the lower portion of the molecule has reacted with the proteinase (see below). The unusual structural change that permits α2M to function as a universal proteinase scavenger is not readily apparent by a comparison of the rather dissimilar structures of the native and transformed molecules. Their dissimilarity has resulted in numerous and divergent proposals concerning the proteinase trapping phenomenon from electron microscopy studies (6Delain E. Pochon F. Barray M. Van Leuven F.

The structure of the intermediate functional state represented by α2M-HT can be analyzed for possible similarities linking it to native and transformed α2M. Hypotheses based on three-dimensional structures to explain the transformation of α2M (7Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 8Boisset N. Taveau J.-C. Pochon F. Lamy J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25762-25769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) proposed that the transformation of α2M occurs with a compression along its major axis coupled with a lateral expansion. Thus, the lip view of α2M changes into a shape that corresponds to the end view of α2M-MA. However, it is difficult to reconcile the shape of α2M-HT with their proposed rearrangement. Andersen et al. (10Andersen G.R. Koch T.J. Dolmer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Nyborg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25133-25141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) simulated the structure of native α2M by a vertical displacement of the subunits and some rearrangement of an internal region of protein density of their x-ray structure. The shapes of the four individual subunits in the structure were left unchanged. Their proposed transformation is inconsistent with the reversal of the handedness of the twist in the two strands between α2M and α2M-MA (7Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and does not account for the partial untwisting and separation of the strands in α2M-HT. Kolodziej et al. (7Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) showed that the two strands that traverse the body of the native and α2M-MA structures are a common feature and are arranged with the opposite handedness (Fig. 6). They proposed that the rearrangement involves a separation of the strands at the opposite ends of the native molecule, their untwisting to open the proteinase binding cavity and a retwisting around the proteinase with the opposite handedness to entrap it (Fig. 7). The untwisting-retwisting hypothesis of proteinase entrapment is supported by the present studies (see below). This structural change is based on the consideration that the two oppositely twisted strands are the protomeric units that are noncovalently bound by interactions occurring primarily at the ends and near the middle of the native and transformed molecules, respectively (Fig. 7, a and c). Each protomeric unit contains two disulfide-linked 180-kDa subunits in an anti-parallel arrangement (7Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 30Jensen P.E.H. Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15863-15869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the four thiol ester bonds maintain the strands in the twisted state. In this model, the lateral arm-like extensions on α2M-MA (Fig. 7 c) result from a separation of the strands that are joined to form the chisel-like ends of α2M. This hypothesis is supported by immunoelectron microscopy studies of monoclonal Fab-labeled α2M and α2M-MA. The Fabs are located near the chisel-shaped bodies of the native structure and near the arms of α2M-MA (7Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is established that the initial proteinase reaction with α2M involves the cleavage of two bait regions and the hydrolysis of two thiol esters to give an intermediate form that reacts more slowly with the second proteinase (1Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-111542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We propose that α2M-HT is representative of the intermediate structure. The α2M-HT structure supports the proposed rearrangement and gives further insight into proteinase entrapment. The Sepharose-bound chymotrypsin cleaves two bait regions located on the same side of the minor axis of the structure resulting in the untwisting of the strands (Fig. 6) and their partial separation in the bottom half of the structure to form its bulbous shape (Fig. 7 b). The complete separation of the strands and their retwisting to form the arms associated with the transformed structure are evidently hindered by the intact thiol esters in the upper half of the molecule. In this proposal, one-half of each protomeric unit is cleaved in the bottom portion of the structure and therefore the functional division is on the minor axis. This assignment of the functional division is supported by the three-dimensional structure of the α2M-chymotrypsin ternary complex, which showed that two molecules are encapsulated on either side of its minor axis (5Schroeter J.P. Kolodziej S.J. Wagenknecht T. Bretaudiere J.-P. Bretaudiere J.T. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K J. Struct. Biol. 1992; 109: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast, the top half of the structure has the chisel-shaped feature of the native structure, which is probably maintained by the two intact thiol esters. However, the changes in the bottom portion of the structure result in a significant enlargement of the chisel-shaped body and a partial separation of the strands in its upper half (Figs. 6 and 7). These changes may be related to the reduced reactivity of the remaining bait domains to subsequent proteolysis (1Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-111542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,11Gettins P.G. W Crews B.C. Cunningham L.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5613-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is interesting, though, that the remaining thiol esters exhibit the same reactivity to methylamine as in the native structure (11Gettins P.G. W Crews B.C. Cunningham L.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5613-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Their unchanged reactivity may be related to their similar disposition in the two molecules. In addition to the untwisting of the two strands after the initial cleavage event, they separate to form four strands of lower protein density resulting in a central cavity that is more accessible to the proteinase (Figs. 6 and 7). The proteinase enters the open cavity of α2M-HT by passive diffusion or is pulled into the cavity as a consequence of its binding to the bait domain. In this regard, the bait domain is not accessible to proteolysis in α2M-MA, suggesting that it is internalized (31Gettins P.G.W. Boel E. Crews B.C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We have ascribed the major top-bottom asymmetry of α2M-HT to the preferential cleavage of the bait and thiol ester domains on one side of the structure's minor axis. The minor left-right asymmetry associated with the variable size and densities of the four strands may be related to the multiplicity of cleavage sites for chymotrypsin in the bait region (32Sottrup-Jensen L. Hansen H.F. Pederson H.S. Kristensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17727-17737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cleavage of the thiol esters by methylamine or as a result of reacting α2M with a proteinase exposes receptor binding domains. As a consequence, the transformed α2M binds to receptors on hepatocytes and is internalized and degraded (1Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-111542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Starkey P.M. Barrett A.J. Barrett A.J. Proteinases in Mammalian Cells and Tissues. Elsevier-North Holland, Amsterdam1977: 663-696Google Scholar). Immunoelectron microscopy showed that these domains are associated with the arms of the transformed α2M (33Delain E. Barray M. Tapon-Bretaudiere J. Pochon F. Marynen P. Cassiman J.-J. Van den Berghe H. Van Leuven F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2981-2989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We propose that these domains are sequestered in the native structure where the two strands meet to form the chisel-shaped bodies at both ends of the structure. The separation and untwisting of the strands upon thiol ester cleavage exposes these domains near the tips of the arms of the transformed molecule (Fig. 7). It is not known if these domains are exposed in α2M-HT. The four thiol groups (Cys-949) resulting from cleavage of the functional thiol esters by methylamine have been located on the interior walls near the center of the x-ray structure (10Andersen G.R. Koch T.J. Dolmer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Nyborg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25133-25141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The internal distance between the thiols varies from 31 to 44 Å, which is in agreement with values reported from fluorescence spectroscopy (34Gettins P. Beecham J.M Crews B.C. Cunningham L.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7747-7753Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The location of the thiol esters in the native structure is not known. It was proposed that the four bait domains are located inside the cavity of α2M-MA 11–17 Å from the Cys-949 (10Andersen G.R. Koch T.J. Dolmer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Nyborg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25133-25141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 35Gettins P. Beth A.H. Cunningham L.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2905-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and that this domain is also inside the native structure (10Andersen G.R. Koch T.J. Dolmer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Nyborg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25133-25141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Since new inter and intramolecular disulfide bonds were formed in a variant that contained a single cysteine residue within the bait region, it was proposed that the four bait domains are located in close proximity in the center of the molecule (36Bowen M.E. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1825-1831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, the location of the new disulfide bonds in the amino acid sequence was not determined so that it is equally possible that they involve residues outside the bait regions and consequently their location and putative proximity remains ambiguous. Our structural studies suggest that the small ∼25-Å diameter openings of the native structure (7Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) appear too small to allow access to an interior bait region by proteinases which vary in molecular weight from 25 (chymotrypsin) to 85 kDa (plasmin). Furthermore, the α2M-HT structure suggests that the remaining bait domains reside near the chisel-shaped body where they may function to maintain the contact between the two strands (37Gettins P.G.W. Hahn K.-H. Crews B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14160-14167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). An alternative proposal is that the bait domain lies externally near the bridge structures that serve as a gateway to the internal cavity (7Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). (The bridge structures are two strand-like features that form the external wall of the cavity near its middle). The α2M-HT appears to lack these bridges that may be related to the diminished reactivity of the bait regions to proteolysis. We thank Dr. Jens Nyborg for the x-ray density map of α2M-MA.

https://openalex.org/W2034961094,"We have sought to develop methodologies to identify genes that are preferentially expressed during the differentiation of mast cells from their hematopoietic stem cell precursors. By using a modified differential display protocol, we compared a subset of transcripts expressed in bone marrow cells differentiated into immature mast cells with the exogenous addition of stem cell factor (SCF) or interleukin 3. One gene was identified that was preferentially expressed in the SCF-derived cells and encodes a novel murine integrin β subunit-like molecule, dubbed Pactolus-1 (Pactolus). Two distinct forms of Pactolus mRNA were detected which, via alternative splicing, are predicted to encode a membrane-bound form and truncated version of the protein. The full-length Pactolus gene product is very similar to a number of β subunit integrin chains, particularly β2, with the notable exceptions of the apparent deletion of the metal-binding site within the putative metal ion-dependent adhesion site-like domain of the Pactolus gene product and a cytoplasmic domain that shares no obvious homology to similar domains of the other β subunit integrin proteins. Although the Pactolus sequence was first identified in immature mast cell samples, screening of murine tissues indicated the highest level of Pactolus expression was found in the bone marrow, suggesting that the expression of Pactolus is confined to immature and maturing bone marrow-derived cells, and that the SCF-derived mast cells are more representative of this state than are the interleukin 3-derived mast cells. Immunoprecipitation of Pactolus revealed a cell-surface protein with an apparent molecular mass of about 95 kDa. Surprisingly, no associating α integrin subunit could be identified suggesting that either Pactolus does not associate with another integrin subunit or the association is too weak to be identified. These data suggest that Pactolus represents a gene and gene product related to those of the integrin β subunits but whose function(s) may be quite distinct from those of the integrin β subunits."
