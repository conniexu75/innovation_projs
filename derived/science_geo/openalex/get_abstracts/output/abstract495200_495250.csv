https://openalex.org/W2157734656,"Theory and evidence suggest that empathy is an important motivating factor for prosocial behaviour and that emotion regulation, i.e. the capacity to exert control over an emotional response, may moderate the degree to which empathy is associated with prosocial behaviour. However, studies to date have not simultaneously explored the associations between different empathic processes and prosocial behaviour, nor whether different types of emotion regulation strategies (e.g. cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) moderate associations between empathy and prosocial behaviour. One hundred–and-ten healthy adults completed questionnaire measures of empathy, emotion regulation and prosocial tendencies. In this sample, both affective and cognitive empathy predicted self-reported prosocial tendencies. In addition, cognitive reappraisal moderated the association between affective empathy and prosocial tendencies. Specifically, there was a significant positive association between empathy and prosocial tendencies for individuals with a low or average tendency to reappraise but not for those with a high tendency to reappraise. Our findings suggest that, in general, empathy is positively associated with prosocial behaviour. However, this association is not significant for individuals with a high tendency for cognitive reappraisal."
https://openalex.org/W2024538200,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, which inhibit the stability and/or translation of a mRNA. miRNAs have been found to play a powerful role in various cardiovascular diseases. Recently, we have demonstrated that a microRNA (miR-181c) can be encoded in the nucleus, processed to the mature form in the cytosol, translocated into the mitochondria, and ultimately can regulate mitochondrial gene expression. However the in vivo impact of miR-181c is unknown. Here we report an in-vivo method for administration of miR-181c in rats, which leads to reduced exercise capacity and signs of heart failure, by targeting the 3′-end of mt-COX1 (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1). We cloned miR-181c and packaged it in lipid-based nanoparticles for systemic delivery. The plasmid DNA complexed nanovector shows no apparent toxicity. We find that the mRNA levels of mitochondrial complex IV genes in the heart, but not any other mitochondrial genes, are significantly altered with miR-181c overexpression, suggesting selective mitochondrial complex IV remodeling due to miR-181c targeting mt-COX1. Isolated heart mitochondrial studies showed significantly altered O2-consumption, ROS production, matrix calcium, and mitochondrial membrane potential in miR-181c-treated animals. For the first time, this study shows that miRNA delivered to the heart in-vivo can lead to cardiac dysfunction by regulating mitochondrial genes."
https://openalex.org/W2044887247,"Ascaris suum is one of the most prevalent nematode parasites in pigs and causes significant economic losses, and also serves as a good model for A. lumbricoides, the large roundworm of humans that is ubiquitous in developing countries and causes malnutrition, stunted growth and compromises immunity to other pathogens. New treatment options for Ascaris infections are urgently needed, to reduce reliance on the limited number of synthetic anthelmintic drugs. In areas where Ascaris infections are common, ethno-pharmacological practices such as treatment with natural plant extracts are still widely employed. However, scientific validation of these practices and identification of the active compounds are lacking, although observed effects are often ascribed to plant secondary metabolites such as tannins. Here, we extracted, purified and characterised a wide range of condensed tannins from diverse plant sources and investigated anthelmintic effects against A. suum in vitro. We show that condensed tannins can have potent, direct anthelmintic effects against A. suum, as evidenced by reduced migratory ability of newly hatched third-stage larvae and reduced motility and survival of fourth-stage larvae recovered from pigs. Transmission electron microscopy showed that CT caused significant damage to the cuticle and digestive tissues of the larvae. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the strength of the anthelmintic effect is related to the polymer size of the tannin molecule. Moreover, the identity of the monomeric structural units of tannin polymers may also have an influence as gallocatechin and epigallocatechin monomers exerted significant anthelmintic activity whereas catechin and epicatechin monomers did not. Therefore, our results clearly document direct anthelmintic effects of condensed tannins against Ascaris and encourage further in vivo investigation to determine optimal strategies for the use of these plant compounds for the prevention and/or treatment of ascariosis."
https://openalex.org/W1969505475,"Balance control must be rapidly modified to provide stability in the face of environmental challenges. Although changes in reactive balance over repeated perturbations have been observed previously, only anticipatory postural adjustments preceding voluntary movements have been studied in the framework of motor adaptation and learning theory. Here, we hypothesized that adaptation occurs in task-level balance control during responses to perturbations due to central changes in the control of both anticipatory and reactive components of balance. Our adaptation paradigm consisted of a Training set of forward support-surface perturbations, a Reversal set of novel countermanding perturbations that reversed direction, and a Washout set identical to the Training set. Adaptation was characterized by a change in a motor variable from the beginning to the end of each set, the presence of aftereffects at the beginning of the Washout set when the novel perturbations were removed, and a return of the variable at the end of the Washout to a level comparable to the end of the Training set. Task-level balance performance was characterized by peak center of mass (CoM) excursion and velocity, which showed adaptive changes with repetitive trials. Only small changes in anticipatory postural control, characterized by body lean and background muscle activity were observed. Adaptation was found in the evoked long-latency muscular response, and also in the sensorimotor transformation mediating that response. Finally, in each set, temporal patterns of muscle activity converged towards an optimum predicted by a trade-off between maximizing motor performance and minimizing muscle activity. Our results suggest that adaptation in balance, as well as other motor tasks, is mediated by altering central sensitivity to perturbations and may be driven by energetic considerations."
https://openalex.org/W2062740724,"Background Place of delivery is a crucial factor which affects the health and wellbeing of the mother and newborn. Institutional delivery helps the women to access skilled assistance, drugs, equipment, and referral transport. Even though 34% of pregnant women received at least one antenatal care from a skilled provider in Ethiopia by 2013, institutional delivery was 10%. The main objective of the study was to assess determinants of institutional delivery in Western Ethiopia. Methods Retrospective unmatched case control study design was used to assess determinants of institutional delivery in Western Ethiopia from September to October 2013. A total of 320 respondents from six districts of East Wollega zone, West Ethiopia were included. Data were collected using pretested and structured questionnaires. Data were entered and cleaned by Epi-info then exported and analyzed using SPSS software. Statistical significance was determined through a 95% confidence level. Results Education [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) (95% Confidence Interval (CI)) = 2.754(1.510–8.911)], family size [AOR (95% CI) = .454(.209–.984)], residence [AOR (95% CI) = 3.822 (1.766–8.272)] were important predictors of place of delivery. Four or more antenatal care [(ANC) (AOR (95% CI) = 2.914(1.105–7.682)], birth order [(AOR (95% CI) = .136(.054–.344), age at last delivery [(AOR (95% CI) = 9.995(2.101–47.556)], birth preparedness [AOR (95% CI) = 6.957(2.422–19.987)], duration of labour [AOR (95% CI) = 3.541(1.732–7.239)] were significantly associated with institutional delivery. Moreover service related factors such as distance from health institutions [AOR (95% CI) = .665(.173–.954)], respondents’ awareness of skill of health care professionals [AOR (95% CI) = 2.454 (1.663–6.255)], mode of transportations [AOR (95% CI) = .258(.122–.549)] were significantly associated with institutional delivery. Conclusions and Recommendations Policy makers, health service organizations, community leaders and other concerned bodies have to consider the predictors of institutional delivery like education, birth order, antenatal care utilization and residence to improve institutional delivery in the area."
https://openalex.org/W2077005028,"Plant desaturases comprise two independently evolved classes, a structurally well characterized soluble class responsible for the production of monoenes in the plastids of higher plants and the poorly structurally characterized integral membrane class that has members in the plastid and endoplasmic reticulum that are responsible for producing mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Both require iron and oxygen for activity and are inhibited by azide and cyanide underscoring their common chemical imperatives. We previously showed that the Δ9 acyl-CoA integral membrane desaturase Ole1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibits dimeric organization, like the soluble plastidial acyl-ACP desaturases. Here we use two independent bimolecular complementation assays, i.e. yeast two-hybrid analysis and Arabidopsis leaf protoplast split luciferase assay, to demonstrate that members of the plant integral membrane fatty acid desaturase (FAD) family, FAD2, FAD3, FAD6, FAD7, and FAD8, self-associate. Further, the endoplasmic reticulum-localized desaturase FAD2 can associate with FAD3, as can the plastid-localized FAD6 desaturase with either FAD7 or FAD8. These pairings appear to be specific because pairs such as FAD3 and FAD7 (or FAD8) and FAD2 and FAD6 do not interact despite their high amino acid similarity. These results are consistent also with their known endoplasmic reticulum and plastid subcellular localizations. Chemical cross-linking experiments confirm that FAD2 and FAD3 can form dimers like the yeast Ole1p and, when coexpressed, can form FAD2-FAD3 heterodimers. Metabolic flux analysis of yeast coexpressing FAD2 and FAD3 indicates that heterodimers can form a metabolic channel in which 18:1-PC is converted to 18:3-PC without releasing a free 18:2-PC intermediate.

Desaturase enzymes typically introduce cis double bonds into fatty acids in a process that requires a supply of reductant and molecular oxygen (1Bloch K. Enzymatic synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids.Acc. Chem. Res. 1969; 2: 193-202Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). There are two evolutionarily distinct forms of desaturase enzymes, a predominant and widespread class of integral membrane enzymes that occur in organisms as diverse as fungi, bacteria, animals, and plants and a soluble class of acyl-ACP desaturases that are primarily found in higher plant plastids (2Shanklin J.

The membrane desaturases belong to an enzyme family that includes bacterial diiron-containing alkane hydroxylase (4Shanklin J. Achim C. Schmidt H. Fox B.G. Münck E.

Membrane desaturases subsequently convert oleate to linoleic (cis,cis-Δ9,12-octadecadienoic) acid and α-linolenic (all cis-Δ9,12,15-octadecatrienoic) acids, which are the most abundant fatty acids in plants (7Okuley J.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids are synthesized by one of two parallel pathways commonly referred to as the prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathways that are located in the plastids and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively (9Somerville C. Browse J. Plant lipids: metabolism, mutants, and membranes.Science. 1991; 252: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Fatty acids are esterified to different lipids in the two compartments, phosphatidycholine (PC) 3The abbreviations used are:PCphosphatidylcholineACPacyl carrier proteinERendoplasmic reticulumFADfatty acid desaturaseFAMEfatty acid methyl esterCubC-terminal fragment of ubiquitinNubN-terminal ubiquitin fragmentRLUCRenilla split luciferaseY2Hyeast two hybrid. in the ER and glycosylglycerides in the plastid. Conversion of oleic to linoleic acid is mediated by FAD2 in the ER and by FAD6 in the plastids, and conversion of linoleic to α-linolenic acid is mediated by FAD3 in the ER and by either FAD7 or FAD8 in the plastid (10Ohlrogge J.B. Browse J. Somerville C.R. The genetics of plant lipids.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1082: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Trigalactosyldiacylglycerol proteins have been shown to mediate the transport of lipids from the ER to the plastid, thereby providing a means of trafficking of fatty acids from the cytoplasm back to their site of synthesis (11Xu C. Moellering E.R. Muthan B. Fan J. Benning C.

Membrane-bound fatty acid desaturases share a degree of sequence similarity that includes three motifs comprised of eight conserved histidine residues thought to be important in forming a diiron center at the active site (12Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Eight histidine residues are catalytically essential in a membrane-associated iron enzyme, stearoyl-CoA desaturase, and are conserved in alkane hydroxylase and xylene monooxygenase.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). They differ functionally in terms of their affinity not only for different types of glycerolipids but also for different fatty acid substrates as described above. Soluble acyl-ACP desaturases are readily expressed in Escherichia coli in quantities sufficient for their characterization, which enabled valuable correlations to be made between their structure and function (13Lindqvist Y. Delta Nine Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester UK2001Google Scholar). For instance the crystal structure of the castor and ivy acyl-ACP desaturases confirmed their homodimeric organization mediated by deep interdigitation of loops between protomers adjacent to the four-helix bundles in which the diiron active site is located (14Lindqvist Y. Huang W. Schneider G. Shanklin J.

Based on the dimeric structure of soluble desaturase, a mechanism involving half-of-the-sites reactivity was proposed in which the desolvation energy released upon substrate binding would be transferred to the second subunit to help facilitate product release (16Broadwater J.A. Ai J. Loehr T.M. Sanders-Loehr J. Fox B.G.

Lyle K.S. Rogge C.E. Reactions of the diiron enzyme stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase.Acc Chem Res. 2004; 37: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Far less is known about the organization of membrane desaturases, which have generally proved recalcitrant to overexpression, purification, and characterization. To circumvent the need for purified materials for biophysical analysis, we have undertaken a molecular genetic approach to understanding the organization of the membrane desaturases. In a previous study, we presented evidence that functional yeast Δ9-desaturase Ole1 forms a dimer in vivo (18Lou Y. Shanklin J. Evidence that the yeast desaturase Ole1p exists as a dimer in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 19384-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To determine whether the observed dimeric organization of the yeast desaturase is shared with other desaturases, we undertook the present study of a series of higher plant membrane desaturases, FAD2, FAD3, FAD6, FAD7, and FAD8, using two independent bimolecular complementation assays. The first involves two-hybrid analysis in yeast; the second employs a split luciferase assay in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts. Data from these studies show that all the FAD desaturases investigated herein are capable of forming self-associations in vivo. In addition to self-association, we also identified specific desaturase associations between FAD2 and FAD3 of the ER and between FAD6 and FAD7 or FAD8 of the plastids. The bimolecular complementation analysis is supported by evidence from chemical cross-linking experiments visualized by Western blot analysis in which FAD2-FAD3 heterodimers were formed upon coexpression in yeast. Furthermore, metabolic flux analysis shows when FAD2 and FAD3 are coexpressed that labeled oleate can be channeled to α-linolenic acid without release of the linoleic acid intermediate. Cultures were initiated from single yeast colonies. Yeast cells (YPH499) were cultured overnight in SD −Ura containing 2% glucose at 30 °C (18Lou Y. Shanklin J. Evidence that the yeast desaturase Ole1p exists as a dimer in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 19384-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Upon reaching an A600 of 0.5, cell pellets were collected by centrifugation and washed with SD −Ura lacking dextrose, after which the cells were induced at 30 °C for 4 h in SD −Ura supplemented with 2% galactose, 0.5% Tergitol Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm oleic acid, and 0.1 mm linoleic acid, followed by incubation at 18 °C for between 1 and 4 days. The cells were collected from 0.5 ml of culture by centrifugation, washed with 1% Tergitol Nonidet P-40 followed by water, and dried under a stream of N2. Lipids were extracted with two volumes of methanol:chloroform:formic acid (2:1:1) by grinding with glass beads for 5 min before supplementing with ½ volume of 1 m KCl, 0.2 m H3PO4 and separating the organic and aqueous phases by centrifugation. Heptadecanoic acid was used as an internal standard. PC was isolated from total lipids by separation on TLC plates pretreated with 0.15 m (NH4)2SO4 and developed with acetone:toluene:H2O (91:30:7) before staining with iodine vapor. Fatty acids were esterified by incubation with 1 ml of 1 n HCl-methanol (or 1 ml of boron trichloride) at 80 °C for 1 h. Following incubation, 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl was added, and fatty acids were extracted into 2 ml of hexane. The resulting fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were concentrated by evaporation under a stream of nitrogen. Samples were analyzed on a Hewlett-Packard 6890 (Hewlett-Packard, Roseville, CA) gas chromatograph equipped with a 5973 mass selective detector (GC/MS) and a Supelco 60 m × 250 μm SP-2340 cyano capillary column. The oven temperature was raised from 100 to 240 °C at a rate of 15 °C/min and then held constant at 240 °C for 5 min, with a helium flow of 1.1 ml/min. For the PC channeling assay, the GC/MS acquisition was performed using electron impact ionization operating in selected ion monitoring mode, which gives adequate sensitivity to quantitate the isotope ratios in the molecular ion (M+) clusters of oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acid methyl esters with m/z 296.3 (C19H36O2), m/z 264.3 (C19H34O2), and m/z 262.3 (C19H32O2), respectively (selected ion monitoring parameters: m/z are 291.20, 292.20, 293.20, 294.20, 295.20, 296.20, 297.20, 298.20, 299.20, 300.20, and 301.20). The fractions of unlabeled fatty acid molecules, as well as molecules heavier by one or two mass units (for 13C1 and d2 label, respectively), were obtained after numerical correction of the mass isotopomer distribution vector for the contribution of naturally occurring isotopes of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen based on multiplication with the inverse of the isotope correction matrices for C19H36O2, C19H34O2, and C19H32O2, respectively. The correction matrices were derived as defined by van Winden et al. (19van Winden W.A. Wittmann C. Heinzle E. Heijnen J.J.

Arabidopsis protoplasts were prepared based on the “tape-Arabidopsis sandwich” method developed by Lin and co-workers (21Wu F.H. Shen S.C. Lee L.Y. Lee S.H. Chan M.T. Lin C.S. Tape-Arabidopsis sandwich: a simpler Arabidopsis protoplast isolation method.Plant Methods. 2009; 5: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Leaves were harvested from 3–5-week-old plants. A tape-leaf sandwich was created by adhering 3 m tape to the upper and lower epidermis. After stripping the lower epidermis, the leaf was incubated in an enzyme solution containing 1% cellulose Onozuka R10 (Yakult, Tokyo, Japan), 0.25% macerozyme Onozuka R10 (Yakult), 0.4 m mannitol, 10 mm CaCl2, 20 mm KCl, 0.1% BSA, 20 mm MES, pH 5.7. Protoplast cells were released into the solution, collected, washed in W5 solution (154 mm NaCl, 125 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, 2 mm MES, pH 5.7), and resuspended in modified MMg solution (0.4 m mannitol, 15 mm MgCl2, 4 mm MES, pH 5.7) at ∼5 × 105 cells/ml before use. Protoplasts were transfected by established methods (18Lou Y. Shanklin J. Evidence that the yeast desaturase Ole1p exists as a dimer in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 19384-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼5 × 104 protoplasts in 0.2 ml of MMg solution were mixed with 30 μg of plasmid DNA and diluted 1:1 (v:v) with a freshly prepared solution containing 40% (w/v) PEG (molecular weight, 4000; Fluka-Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 m CaCl2, and 0.2 m mannitol. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 5 min, before the gradual addition of 3 ml of W5 solution. Protoplasts were collected and washed with W5 solution before gentle resuspension in 1 ml of W5 solution and incubation in darkness for 16 h before analysis. The DNA vectors used for split luciferase assay were constructed according to Ref. 22Fujikawa Y. Kato N. Split luciferase complementation assay to study protein-protein interactions in Arabidopsis protoplasts.Plant J. 2007; 52: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar. 90 μl of protoplast cell suspensions were transferred to wells in a 96-well plate to which 10 μl of 60 μm coelenterazine (ViviRen live cell substrate; Promega, Madison, WI) was added. The plate was incubated for 40 min at 22 °C in the dark before measuring the luminescence. Luminescence from each well was quantified with 1-s integration periods using a Packard TopCount NXT microplate scintillation and luminescence counter (Packard, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Yeast cells were lysed in Y-PER yeast extraction buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Following 15 min of centrifugation at 12,000 × g, the supernatant was supplemented with 0.5% protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich), and the proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and analyzed by Western blot using monoclonal anti-FLAG M2-alkaline phosphatase antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). The reactive bands on membranes were visualized after incubation with nitroblue tetrazolium/bromochloroindolyl phosphate. Protein levels were estimated using densitometry with image analysis software (Alpha ImagerTM 2200 version 5.5; Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA). Yeast cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with water, and disintegrated in PBS buffer containing 0.2% perfluorooctanoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) by vigorous shaking with glass beads. After 15 min of centrifugation at 12,000 × g, the supernatant was supplemented with 0.5% protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich). For cross-linker treatment, Lomant's reagent, dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 2 mm. After incubation for 0.5 h on ice, Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was added to a final concentration of 20 mm to terminate the reaction. The mixture was mixed with Laemmli buffer lacking reducing reagent, and the proteins were separated on a 4–15% gradient gel (Bio-Rad), transferred to a PVDF membrane, and analyzed by Western blotting with monoclonal anti-FLAG M2-alkaline phosphatase antibodies. Immunoreactive polypeptides were visualized after incubation with nitroblue tetrazolium/bromochloroindolyl phosphate. Yeast YPH499 cells were cultured at 30 °C overnight in SD −Ura containing 2% glucose. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation and washed with SD −Ura lacking dextrose. Cells were induced by the addition of SD −Ura containing 2% galactose when the A600 of the culture reached 0.5. Cultures were incubated for 4 h at 30 °C, followed by various times in the presence of 0.5% Tergitol Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm of deuterium-labeled oleic acid 9,10-d2 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1 mm of 1-13C-labeled linoleic acid (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX). All experiments were performed at 18 °C. PC-bound 18:3Δ9,12,15 can be derived either via FAD3 from 18:2Δ9,12 bound to the free pool of PC, or via a FAD2-FAD3 complex from PC-bound 18:1Δ9. This relation is expressed in Equation 2, (PCΔ3uPCΔ3D2PCΔ3C13)=(PCΔ2uPCΔ2D2PCΔ2C13)V1+(PCΔ1uPCΔ1D2PCΔ1C13)V2(Eq. 1) where v1 is the rate of conversion of PC-18:2Δ9,12 to PC-18:2Δ9,12,15 by FAD3, and v2 is the rate of conversion of PC-18:1Δ9 to PC-18:2Δ9,12,15 by combined activities of FAD2 andFAD3. The unlabeled and d2- and 13C-labeled fractions of 18:1Δ9 bound to PC are designated as PCΔ1u, PCΔ1D2, and PCΔ1C13, respectively. The fractions of the other PC-bound fatty acid species are designated accordingly, i.e. PCΔ2u, PCΔ2D2, and PCΔ2C13 (18:2Δ9,12) and PCΔ3u, PCΔ3D2, and PCΔ3C13 (18:3Δ9,12,15). Using our experimentally measured values, the equation was solved for v1 and v2 by linear regression, using the LINEST function in Microsoft EXCEL, which solves a general linear equation of the form y = mx + b for the unknown m. To do so we set b to be 0 and substituted parts of Equation 2 into y, m, and x as follows. y=(PCΔ3uPCΔ3D2PCΔ3C13);X=(PCΔ2uPCΔ2D2PCΔ2C13PCΔ1uPCΔ1D2PCΔ1C13);m=(V1V2)(Eq. 2) To test the hypothesis that plant membrane FAD-type desaturases, like their yeast counterpart Ole1, form homodimers, we subjected them to bimolecular complementation analysis using the split ubiquitin system in baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Membrane desaturases were individually cloned into a bait vector such that they were expressed with a C-terminal fragment of ubiquitin (Cub) followed by the artificial transcription factor protein A-LexA-VP16 (Fig. 1A). Upon interaction of bait and target proteins, a functional ubiquitin is formed that leads to release of PLV (Protein-LexA-VP16) to activate LexA, which regulates His3 and Ade2 expression to complement the prototrophy, thereby allowing growth on His−, Ade− medium. To form a positive split ubiquitin association, the CubPLV and the N-terminal ubiquitin fragment (Nub) peptides must both be located on the cytosolic face of membrane. In the absence of detailed structural information such as a crystal structure, two prey vectors were constructed: a Nub G-desaturase fusion and a desaturase-Nub G fusion, the former to test for tail to head interaction and the latter to test for tail to tail interaction (by convention, head or tail is used to refer to the location of the ubiquitin fragment at the N or C terminus, respectively, as fusions to the target protein) (see Fig. 1A for a schematic diagram). All construct-containing yeast grew on SD-L-T, but only the positive control, containing a WT Nub in the prey vector and the test prey constructs containing the tail to head construct grew on SD-L-T-H-A-M plates (Fig. 1B). Growth was not restored in yeast strains containing the plant desaturase FAD2 along with standard negative control prey vectors containing KanMX (Fig. 1B, NC1 and NC2), or when Ole1p, a related yeast desaturase, was tested as an additional negative control (Fig. 1B, NC3 and NC4). As shown in Fig. 1B, FAD2 self-associates, i.e. permits growth in a tail to head orientation, but not in a tail to tail orientation. FAD3, FAD6, FAD7, and FAD8 all conferred the same pattern of growth, indicating that like FAD2, they form specific self-associations. To confirm in vivo interactions, the FAD enzymes were subjected to a second and independent bimolecular complementation assay, employing Renilla split luciferase (RLUC) in Arabidopsis protoplast cells. In principle, the two complementary fragments of the split luciferase can be fused to either the N or C terminus of the target protein. In practice, the functioning of combined luciferase fragments is dependent on their orientation with respect to the specific protein of interest because of steric and/or folding constraints (23Massoud T.F. Paulmurugan R. Gambhir S.S. Molecular imaging of homodimeric protein-protein interactions in living subjects.FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1105-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, it can be useful to test several orientations. To achieve this, an N-terminal luciferase fragment was fused to the N terminus of the desaturase, and this was coexpressed with a C-terminal luciferase fragment fused to either the C or N terminus of the same desaturase creating 2H-2T and 2H-2H, respectively (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Evaluation of the self-association of the various FADs in Arabidopsis leaves protoplasts using a RLUC bimolecular complementation assay.

Experimental signals were corrected for background signals resulting from mock-treated protoplasts. In all cases (FAD2, FAD3, FAD6, FAD7, and FAD8), the observed signals confirmed the self-association identified by yeast two-hybrid analysis. Protoplasts transformed with head to tail orientations (2H-2T, 3H-3T, 7H-7T, and 8H-8T) showed stronger luminescence compared with those transformed with head to head (2H-2H, 3H-3H, 7H-7H, and 8H-8H) orientations (Fig. 2B). The Y2H experiments and split luciferase results demonstrate the propensity of FAD2, FAD3, FAD6, FAD7, and FAD8 to self-associate in yeast and plant cells, respectively. We next investigated whether members of the FAD family are capable of forming hetero-oligomers using Y2H analysis. In addition to the tested pair of FAD enzymes, Fad2-Fad2 or Fad3-Fad3 constructs were included as positive controls, and heteroassociated constructs, such as Fad2-Ole1 or Fad3-Ole1, were included as negative controls (Fig. 3A). It may be helpful to review the functions of and subcellular localizations the FAD enzymes under study here. FAD2 and FAD3 desaturate 18:1 to 18:2 and 18:2 to 18:3, respectively, within the ER, whereas FAD6 and FAD7/FAD8 perform the equivalent reactions within the plastid. Growth of yeast containing pairs of FAD enzymes is shown in Fig. 3B. Two constructs for each FAD pair were engineered, such that each was expressed as a bait and prey or vice versa. Our criterion for positive interaction is observable growth in both combinations of bait and prey (for example, FAD2-FAD3 and FAD3-FAD2). Despite their relatively low sequence similarity (55%), expression of Fad2 and Fad3 resulted in a growth phenotype in both bait and prey configurations, indicating that FAD2 interacts with FAD3 (Fig. 3B). However, the common evolutionary origins and high amino acid sequence similarity between FAD3 and FAD7 (or FAD8) (of ∼83%) raised the possibility that FAD3 might potentially interact with FAD7 or FAD8 (or both) when heterologously coexpressed in yeast. The data presented in Fig. 3B show that FAD3 did not interact with either FAD7 or FAD8. FAD2 and FAD6, which share 44% amino acid similarity, and both encode Δ-12 desaturases that localize to the ER and plastid, respectively, show no interaction by Y2H assay (Fig. 3B). Similarly, FAD6 was shown to self-associate or associate with FAD7 (42% similarity) and FAD8 (44% similarity) (Fig. 3B), but FAD6 does not interact with FAD2 or FAD3. It is notable that FAD7 and FAD8, which both localize to the plastid and share 85% similarity fail to show association by Y2H assay (Fig. 3B). Low levels of growth were observed for Fad3-Fad8, Fad3-Fad6, and Fad7-Fad2 combinations, but they were not considered significant because they did not fulfill our criteria of growth for both bait and prey relationships (see Table 1 for a summary of specific FAD-FAD amino acid similarities and interactions).TABLE 1Summary of interaction/similarity for FAD enzymes used in this studyInte"
https://openalex.org/W1985090392,"Glandular epithelial cells differentiate into complex multicellular or acinar structures, when embedded in three-dimensional (3D) extracellular matrix. The spectrum of different multicellular morphologies formed in 3D is a sensitive indicator for the differentiation potential of normal, non-transformed cells compared to different stages of malignant progression. In addition, single cells or cell aggregates may actively invade the matrix, utilizing epithelial, mesenchymal or mixed modes of motility. Dynamic phenotypic changes involved in 3D tumor cell invasion are sensitive to specific small-molecule inhibitors that target the actin cytoskeleton. We have used a panel of inhibitors to demonstrate the power of automated image analysis as a phenotypic or morphometric readout in cell-based assays. We introduce a streamlined stand-alone software solution that supports large-scale high-content screens, based on complex and organotypic cultures. AMIDA (Automated Morphometric Image Data Analysis) allows quantitative measurements of large numbers of images and structures, with a multitude of different spheroid shapes, sizes, and textures. AMIDA supports an automated workflow, and can be combined with quality control and statistical tools for data interpretation and visualization. We have used a representative panel of 12 prostate and breast cancer lines that display a broad spectrum of different spheroid morphologies and modes of invasion, challenged by a library of 19 direct or indirect modulators of the actin cytoskeleton which induce systematic changes in spheroid morphology and differentiation versus invasion. These results were independently validated by 2D proliferation, apoptosis and cell motility assays. We identified three drugs that primarily attenuated the invasion and formation of invasive processes in 3D, without affecting proliferation or apoptosis. Two of these compounds block Rac signalling, one affects cellular cAMP/cGMP accumulation. Our approach supports the growing needs for user-friendly, straightforward solutions that facilitate large-scale, cell-based 3D assays in basic research, drug discovery, and target validation."
https://openalex.org/W1993852113,"Oligosaccharides are the third largest component in human milk. This abundance is remarkable because oligosaccharides are not digestible by the newborn, and yet they have been conserved and amplified during evolution. In addition to encouraging the growth of a protective microbiota dominated by bifidobacteria, oligosaccharides have anti-infective activity, preventing pathogens from binding to intestinal cells. Although it would be advantageous adding these valuable molecules to infant milk formula, the technologies to reproduce the variety and complexity of human milk oligosaccharides by enzymatic/organic synthesis are not yet mature. Consequently, there is an enormous interest in alternative sources of these valuable oligosaccharides. Recent research has demonstrated that bovine milk and whey permeate also contain oligosaccharides. Thus, a thorough characterization of oligosaccharides in bovine dairy streams is an important step towards fully assessing their specific functionalities. In this study, bovine milk oligosaccharides (BMOs) were concentrated by membrane filtration from a readily available dairy stream called “mother liquor”, and analyzed by high accuracy MALDI FT-ICR mass spectrometry. The combination of HPLC and accurate mass spectrometry allowed the identification of ideal processing conditions leading to the production of Kg amount of BMO enriched powders. Among the BMOs identified, 18 have high-molecular weight and corresponded in size to the most abundant oligosaccharides present in human milk. Notably 6 oligosaccharides contained fucose, a sugar monomer that is highly abundant in human milk, but is rarely observed in bovine milk. This work shows that dairy streams represent a potential source of complex milk oligosaccharides for commercial development of unique dairy ingredients in functional foods that reproduce the benefits of human milk."

In 2011-2012, during TEMPO-mini's first deployment on the NEPTUNE network, the module recorded high-resolution imagery, temperature, iron (Fe) and oxygen on a hydrothermal assemblage at 2186 m depth at Main Endeavour Field (North East Pacific). 23 days of continuous imagery were analysed with an hourly frequency. Community dynamics were analysed in detail for Ridgeia piscesae tubeworms, Polynoidae, Pycnogonida and Buccinidae, documenting faunal variations, natural change and biotic interactions in the filmed tubeworm assemblage as well as links with the local environment. Semi-diurnal and diurnal periods were identified both in fauna and environment, revealing the influence of tidal cycles. Species interactions were described and distribution patterns were indicative of possible microhabitat preference. The importance of high-resolution frequencies (<1 h) to fully comprehend rhythms in fauna and environment was emphasised, as well as the need for the development of automated or semi-automated imagery analysis tools."
https://openalex.org/W2074901156,"Gambogic acid (GA), the main active component of gamboge resin, has potent antitumor activity both in vivo and in vitro. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we found that GA could initiate autophagy in colorectal cancer cells, and inhibition of the autophagy process accelerated the effect of proliferative inhibition and apoptotic cell death induced by GA, implying a protective role of autophagy. Two-dimensional electrophoresis-based proteomics showed that GA treatment altered the expression of multiple proteins involved in redox signaling and lipid metabolism. Functional studies revealed that GA-induced dysregulation of lipid metabolism could activate 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), resulting in intracellular ROS accumulation, followed by inhibition of Akt-mTOR signaling and autophagy initiation. Finally, results using a xenograft model suggested ROS-induced autophagy protect against the antitumor effect of GA. Taken together, these data showed new biological activities of GA against colorectal cancer underlying the protective role of ROS-induced autophagy. This study will provide valuable insights for future studies regarding the anticancer mechanisms of GA."
https://openalex.org/W2069344672,"Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) are enzymes responsible for the polymerization of the glycan strand and the cross-linking between glycan chains as well as the target proteins for β-lactam antibiotics. Mutational alterations in PBPs can confer resistance either by reducing binding of the antibiotic to the active site or by evolving a β-lactamase activity that degrades the antibiotic. As no systematic studies have been performed to examine the potential of all PBPs present in one bacterial species to evolve increased resistance against β-lactam antibiotics, we explored the ability of fifteen different defined or putative PBPs in Salmonella enterica to acquire increased resistance against penicillin G. We could after mutagenesis and selection in presence of penicillin G isolate mutants with amino-acid substitutions in the PBPs, FtsI, DacB and DacC (corresponding to PBP3, PBP4 and PBP6) with increased resistance against β-lactam antibiotics. Our results suggest that: (i) most evolved PBPs became 'generalists"" with increased resistance against several different classes of β-lactam antibiotics, (ii) synergistic interactions between mutations conferring antibiotic resistance are common and (iii) the mechanism of resistance of these mutants could be to make the active site more accessible for water allowing hydrolysis or less binding to β-lactam antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W1980640097,"DNA methylation is involved in tissue-specific and developmentally regulated gene expression. Here, we screened a novel methylation gene Sox30, whose methylation might contribute to its regulation and testis development in mice. Sox30 is a member of Sox transcription factors, and is considered to be involved in spermatogonial differentiation and spermatogenesis. However, the precise function and regulatory expression pattern remain unclear. In the present study, we found that Sox30 is highly expressed in adult testes but not in ovaries. Sox30 expression begins in early development, and in the testes, it is specifically increased coincidentally with development until adulthood. Moreover, Sox30 is expressed not only in testis germ cells, but also in sertoli cells. Sox30 is hypo-methylated in testis, epididymis and lung of adult mice, in which Sox30 is expressed. By contrast, Sox30 is hypermethylated in ovary, heart, brain, liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas, muscle, intestine, pituitary gland, blood and hippocampus of adult mice, in which the Sox30 is absent. Importantly, decreased methylation at CpG islands of Sox30 is observed in mouse developmental testes after birth, which is associated with enhanced Sox30 expression. However, the hypermethylated status of Sox30 is maintained in ovaries that does not express Sox30 during this period. Further, following demethylation treatment using 5-aza-dC, Sox30 expression is restored in GC2, TM3 and TM4 cell lines. This observation convincingly confirms that methylation really contributes to Sox30 silencing. In summary, we show that Sox30 expression is under the control of DNA methylation status, and this expression pattern is associated with testis development in mice."

https://openalex.org/W2080946092,"The objective was to assess the effects of natural variation in the physical structure of the environment on biological communities and on the processing of Eucalyptus cloeziana and Inga laurina and to identify the controlling factors at different scales along stream order gradients. The study area consisted of 14 sampling sites distributed within a tropical watershed (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th order streams replicated in 4 sub-basins). Our samples consisted of 3 g of leaves of E. cloeziana (high-quality) and I. laurina (low-quality) placed in 252 bags with 10mm mesh (measured by the chemical composition of the detritus). Four samples of each leaf type were collected periodically (three times) over a period of 75–125 days and washed on a sieve to separate the invertebrates. A series of leaf disks were cut to determine ash-free dry mass, polyphenol, lignin, cellulose, total microbial biomass and fungal biomass, and the remaining material was oven-dried to determine the dry weight. We performed analyses within and between spatial scales (regional and local) to assess which watershed scale was the more import determinant of the leaf breakdown rate (k). The microbial and shredder were most influenced at the local scale (stream order). Shredders were influenced by microorganisms, with stronger interactions between them than were found to drive the k at the local scale. Moreover, differences in the overall k and abiotic variables were more strongly influenced at the regional scale (sub-basin), showing that the study scale alters the response of the studied variables. We found higher k values at higher values of water velocity, dissolved oxygen and temperature, all of which accelerate biological metabolism in response to variations on the regional scale. Watersheds with warmer microclimates and streams with higher nutrient levels and oxygen could be accelerating the ecosystem metabolism, independent of the detritus quality."
https://openalex.org/W1969233622,"The BH3-only protein Noxa is a critical mediator of apoptosis and functions primarily by sequestering/inactivating the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1. Although Noxa is a highly labile protein, recent studies suggested that it is degraded by the proteasome in a ubiquitylation-independent manner. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of Noxa degradation and its ability to regulate the stability of Mcl-1. We found that the ubiquitylation-independent degradation of Noxa does not require a physical association with Mcl-1. A short stretch of amino acid residues in the C-terminal tail was found to mediate the proteasome-dependent degradation of Noxa. Ectopic placement of this degron was able to render other proteins unstable. Surprisingly, mutation of this sequence not only attenuated the rapid degradation of Noxa, but also stabilized endogenous Mcl-1 through the BH3-mediated direct interaction. Together, these results suggest that the C-terminal tail of Noxa regulates the stability of both Noxa and Mcl-1."
https://openalex.org/W2044172713,"Improving yield is a major objective for cotton breeding schemes, and lint yield and its three component traits (boll number, boll weight and lint percentage) are complex traits controlled by multiple genes and various environments. Association mapping was performed to detect markers associated with these four traits using 651 simple sequence repeats (SSRs). A mixed linear model including epistasis and environmental interaction was used to screen the loci associated with these four yield traits by 323 accessions of Gossypium hirsutum L. evaluated in nine different environments. 251 significant loci were detected to be associated with lint yield and its three components, including 69 loci with individual effects and all involved in epistasis interactions. These significant loci explain ∼ 62.05% of the phenotypic variance (ranging from 49.06% ∼ 72.29% for these four traits). It was indicated by high contribution of environmental interaction to the phenotypic variance for lint yield and boll numbers, that genetic effects of SSR loci were susceptible to environment factors. Shared loci were also observed among these four traits, which may be used for simultaneous improvement in cotton breeding for yield traits. Furthermore, consistent and elite loci were screened with −Log10 (P-value) >8.0 based on predicted effects of loci detected in different environments. There was one locus and 6 pairs of epistasis for lint yield, 4 loci and 10 epistasis for boll number, 15 loci and 2 epistasis for boll weight, and 2 loci and 5 epistasis for lint percentage, respectively. These results provided insights into the genetic basis of lint yield and its components and may be useful for marker-assisted breeding to improve cotton production."
https://openalex.org/W2092158120,"Lycium barbarum and L. ruthenicum are extensively used as traditional Chinese medicinal plants. Next generation sequencing technology provides a powerful tool for analyzing transcriptomic profiles of gene expression in non-model species. Such gene expression can then be confirmed with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Therefore, use of systematically identified suitable reference genes is a prerequisite for obtaining reliable gene expression data. Here, we calculated the expression stability of 18 candidate reference genes across samples from different tissues and grown under salt stress using geNorm and NormFinder procedures. The geNorm-determined rank of reference genes was similar to those defined by NormFinder with some differences. Both procedures confirmed that the single most stable reference gene was ACNTIN1 for L. barbarum fruits, H2B1 for L. barbarum roots, and EF1α for L. ruthenicum fruits. PGK3, H2B2, and PGK3 were identified as the best stable reference genes for salt-treated L. ruthenicum leaves, roots, and stems, respectively. H2B1 and GAPDH1+PGK1 for L. ruthenicum and SAMDC2+H2B1 for L. barbarum were the best single and/or combined reference genes across all samples. Finally, expression of salt-responsive gene NAC, fruit ripening candidate gene LrPG, and anthocyanin genes were investigated to confirm the validity of the selected reference genes. Suitable reference genes identified in this study provide a foundation for accurately assessing gene expression and further better understanding of novel gene function to elucidate molecular mechanisms behind particular biological/physiological processes in Lycium."
https://openalex.org/W1967258381,"Background The prevalence of Sickle cell disease is extremely high in Democratic Republic of Congo. Despite this high prevalence of the disease, data on renal abnormalities in children are rare. Method The study proposed to assess blood pressure, glomerular function, urea and uric acid levels in 65 steady state Congolese children with homozygous sickle cell disease and 67 normal controls. Results In Hb-SS group, blood pressure level tended to be lower than Hb-AA groups but there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) between the two groups. The absolute values for GFR corrected for BSA were significantly higher in Hb-SS group compared to Hb-AA group (130.5±34.1 ml/min/1.73 m2 vs 113.7±24.5 ml/min/1.73 m2; p = 0.004). Children with Hb-SS were more likely to hyperfiltrate (30.8% of subjects) than children with Hb-AA (6.1% of subjects). Proteinuria was found in 4 (6.2%) children with Hb-SS. Uric acid level was significantly increased in children with Hb-SS compared to corresponding values in control group (4.4±1.3 mg/dl vs 3.5±1.1 mg/dl; p<0.001). Urea level was significantly decreased compared to corresponding values in Hb-AA group (15.3±8.3 mg/dl vs 22.9±10.1 mg/dl; p<0.001). Conclusion Hyperfiltration, low creatinine, lower urea and high uric acid are more common in children with sickle cell disease than in normal controls."

KChIP is a cytoplasmic protein and increases the current amplitude, decelerates the inactivation, and accelerates the recovery from inactivation of Kv4. Crystal structure analysis demonstrated that Kv4 and KChIP form an octameric complex with four Kv4 subunits and four KChIP subunits. However, it remains unknown whether the Kv4·KChIP complex can have a different stoichiometry other than 4:4. In this study, we expressed Kv4.2 and KChIP4 with various ratios in Xenopus oocytes and observed that the biophysical properties of Kv4.2 gradually changed with the increase in co-expressed KChIP4.

First, KChIP promotes the surface expression of Kv4 and increases the current amplitude of Kv4 (22Shibata R. Misonou H. Campomanes C.R. Anderson A.E. Schrader L.A. Doliveira L.C. Carroll K.I.

Second, KChIP binding slows the inactivation of Kv4 by restricting the movement of the N terminus, which may occlude the ion channel pore (24Gebauer M. Isbrandt D. Sauter K. Callsen B. Nolting A.

Third, KChIP accelerates the recovery from inactivation of Kv4 (2An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J.

Parai R. Campbell D.L. Regulation of Kv4.3 voltage-dependent gating kinetics by KChIP2 isoforms.J. Physiol. 2004; 557: 19-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the C terminus of KChIP plays an important role in acceleration of the recovery from inactivation of Kv4 (25Patel S.P. Campbell D.L. Strauss H.C.

The “structurally minimal” isoform KChIP2d modulates recovery of K(v)4.3 N-terminal deletion mutant Δ2–39.Channels. 2011; 5: 225-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanism of the acceleration of the recovery from inactivation remains unknown. The Kv4 channel is composed of four α-subunits. This means that one Kv4 channel has four identical binding sites for KChIP. A previous biochemical study suggested that the purified Kv4.2·KChIP2 complex consists of four subunits for each (28Kim L.A. Furst J. Butler M.H. Xu S. Grigorieff N. Goldstein S.A. Ito channels are octomeric complexes with four subunits of each Kv4.2 and K+ channel-interacting protein 2.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5549-5554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Crystal structure analysis showed that Kv4.3 and KChIP1 form a 4:4 channel complex (29Pioletti M. Findeisen F. Hura G.L. Minor Jr., D.L. Three-dimensional structure of the KChIP1-Kv4.3 T1 complex reveals a cross-shaped octamer.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Structural basis for modulation of Kv4 K+ channels by auxiliary KChIP subunits.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, it still remains uncertain whether the Kv4·KChIP complex is expressed with a stoichiometry of 4:4 exclusively or whether complexes with different stoichiometries also exist. It is also unknown whether the different stoichiometries, if they exist, affect the biophysical properties of the Kv4 channel. In this study, we examined how the expression level of KChIP4 affects the properties of Kv4.2. We first co-expressed Kv4.2 and KChIP4 in different complementary RNA (cRNA) ratios and evaluated the biophysical properties with two-electrode voltage clamp. We observed that the biophysical properties of Kv4.2 changed gradually with an increase in KChIP4 expression, suggesting the existence of Kv4.2·KChIP4 complexes with variable stoichiometries. We subsequently confirmed that the stoichiometry of the Kv4.2·KChIP4 complex affects the properties of Kv4.2 by using tandem repeat constructs in which the stoichiometry is strictly controlled. We finally applied the subunit-counting method by single-molecule imaging (31Ulbrich M.H. Isacoff E.Y. Subunit counting in membrane-bound proteins.Nat.

Although KChIP4 is a cytoplasmic protein, we could successfully apply the method to determine the number of KChIP4 subunits included in a Kv4.2·KChIP4 complex and confirmed that the stoichiometry changes depending on the expression level of KChIP4. Human Kv4.2 (NM_012281.2) and rat KChIP4 (NM_181365.2) were subcloned into the pGEMHE expression vector. For the KChIP4-Kv4.2 tandem construct, a flexible GGS linker (GGSGGSGGSGGSGG) and a NotI site were introduced into the N terminus of Kv4.2 by PCR using KOD Plus version 2 (Toyobo) (“NotI-linker-Kv4.2”). A NotI site was also introduced into the C terminus of KChIP4 by PCR (“KChIP4-NotI”). Two fragments were fused at the NotI site and inserted into the pGEMHE expression vector. For the KChIP4-Kv4.2-Kv4.2 tandem construct, we first made a Kv4.2-Kv4.2 construct by PCR, in which two Kv4.2 sequences were linked with a flexible GGS linker. A fragment was produced from this construct by cleavage at the unique BamHI site in Kv4.2 and inserted into the BamHI site of the KChIP4-Kv4.2 tandem construct. For the monomeric enhanced green fluorescent protein (mEGFP)-tagged constructs, mEGFP was fused to the C terminus of Kv4.2 or KChIP4 with a flexible GGS linker (Kv4.2-mEGFP and KChIP4-mEGFP). For Kv4.2-KChIP4-mEGFP, we first made a Kv4.2-KChIP4 construct. The fragment obtained from KChIP4-mEGFP by cleavage at the unique EcoT22I site in KChIP4 and the unique HindIII site in the vector was inserted between the EcoT22I and HindIII sites in the Kv4.2-KChIP4 construct. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. cRNA was then prepared from the linearized plasmid cDNA using the T7 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion). Oocytes were collected from X. laevis anesthetized in water containing 0.15% Tricaine and treated with collagenase (2 mg/ml; type 1; Sigma-Aldrich) for 6–7 h to remove the follicular cell layer. Oocytes of similar size at stage V or VI were injected with 50 nl of cRNA solution. The injected oocytes were incubated for 1–3 days at 17 °C in frog Ringer solution containing 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, and 0.82 mm MgSO4, pH 7.6, with 0.1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Sigma-Aldrich). All experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the National Institute for Physiological Sciences and performed following the institutional guidelines. K+ currents were recorded under two-electrode voltage clamp 1–3 days after cRNA injection, using an OC-725C amplifier (Warner Instruments). All experiments were performed at room temperature. The microelectrodes were drawn from borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments) to a resistance of 0.2–0.5 megaohms and filled with 3 m potassium acetate and 10 mm KCl (pH 7.2). ND-96 was used for the bath solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Holding potential was at −80 mV. Stimulation, data acquisition, and data analysis were performed using a Digidata 1440 system and pCLAMP version 10.3 software (Molecular Devices). Data from the amplifier were digitized at 10 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. One day after cRNA injection, oocytes were sonicated in PBS containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.76 mm KH2PO4 with protein inhibitor (Complete, Mini, EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). The homogenates were centrifuged at 3000 rpm and 4 °C for 10 min to remove yolk, and the supernatants were retained as protein extracts. These were treated at 100 °C for 5 min in SDS-DTT solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 100 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 2% SDS. SDS-PAGE was performed using 2–15% gradient gels in SDS-PAGE buffer containing 25 mm Tris-base, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS. Protein concentration for each sample was measured by a Bradford protein assay (36Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). The amount of each loaded protein was adjusted to 10 μg. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes in Western blot buffer containing 25 mm Tris-base, 192 mm glycine. The membranes with bound protein were treated with 5% skim milk in TBST solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20. Membranes were then incubated with primary antibody (1:250) at 37 °C for 1 h. The primary antibody against KChIP4 used in this study was anti-KCNIP4 (HPA022862, Sigma-Aldrich). Bound primary antibodies were detected with HRP-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) (GE Healthcare). Immunoreactivity was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (GE Healthcare) and was detected using a LAS-3000 image analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Oocytes of similar size at stage V or VI were injected with 50 nl of cRNA solution. At 12–20 h after cRNA injection, the oocytes were enzymatically treated with 1 unit/ml neuraminidase and 1 mg/ml hyaluronidase for 15 min at 17 °C to remove the extracellular matrix. Oocytes were osmotically shrunk with 2× frog Ringer solution and devitellinized manually by forceps. Oocytes were placed on a high refractive index coverslip (n = 1.78). The coverslip matched the reflective index of the objective lens (Olympus; ×100, numerical aperture 1.65) mounted on an inverted microscope (Olympus; IX71). ND-96 was used as the extracellular solution. mEGFP was excited with a Cyan 488-nm solid state laser (Spectra-Physics), and the fluorescent spots were captured by an iXon3 EMCCD camera (Andor). To obtain total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) conditions, the orientation of the laser was adjusted using a manual mirror. Movies of 400 frames were acquired at 20 Hz for 20 s. The sampling area was 25.6 × 25.6 μm2. The fluorescence intensity of each spot was measured off-line. Only non-overlapping and stable (not moving during the 20-s recording) spots were used for analysis and data collection (31Ulbrich M.H. Isacoff E.Y. Subunit counting in membrane-bound proteins.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 319-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). We analyzed the ionic currents using pCLAMP version 10.3 (Molecular Devices) and Igor Pro software (WaveMetrics, Inc.). The analyses of inactivation, recovery from inactivation, and steady-state inactivation were all performed without leak subtraction. For the analysis of inactivation, the currents from each potential were fitted with either a single or a double exponential function. The time course of recovery from inactivation was fitted with a single exponential function. For steady-state inactivation analysis, the current amplitudes after 5-s depolarization at each command potential were plotted and fitted with a two-state Boltzmann equation, I=Imin+Imax-Imin1+eZFRT(V-V1/2)(Eq. 1) where Imax and Imin are the maximum and minimum current amplitudes during the test pulse, V½ is the half-inactivation voltage, Z is the effective charge, F is Faraday's constant, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. For normalization, I was divided by Imax. In subunit counting, the distributions of observed bleaching steps were fitted with a binomial distribution P(X = a), P(X=a)=A nCapa(1-p)n-a where A is the total number of fluorescent spots (including “0 step” spot), n is the number of bound subunits, a is the observed number of bleaching steps, and p is the probability of GFP being fluorescent. All data are presented as the mean ± S.E., and n represents the number of samples. Statistical differences were evaluated by Student's unpaired t test (for two-group comparisons) or Dunnett's test (for multiple comparisons). Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant (***, p < 0.001). KChIP is known to change some properties of Kv4, such as peak current amplitude, inactivation kinetics, steady state inactivation, and recovery from inactivation (2An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J.

We injected different amounts of KChIP4 cRNA (0–10 ng) with 5 ng of Kv4.2 cRNA in X. laevis oocytes and analyzed the currents with two-electrode voltage clamp. The current amplitude was augmented with an increase in the amount of co-expressed KChIP4 (Fig. 1, A and B). The current amplitude of Kv4.2 was almost doubled, with KChIP4 over 2.5 ng (Fig. 1B). To make sure that the expression of KChIP4 in oocytes varied in proportion to the injected KChIP4 cRNA, Western blotting of KChIP4 prepared from oocytes injected with different amounts of KChIP4 cRNA along with 5 ng of Kv4.2 cRNA was performed. 10 μg of sample protein was loaded in each lane. We observed two bands with different sizes in the lanes of samples from oocytes injected with more than 0.5 ng of KChIP4 cRNA. The larger bands gradually intensified in accordance with the amount of injected KChIP4 (Fig. 1C). To examine the effect of KChIP4 on the expression of Kv4.2, we expressed Kv4.2-mEGFP (0.05 ng) with different amounts of KChIP4 cRNA (0, 0.005, 0.05, and 0.5 ng) in oocytes and analyzed the expression of Kv4.2-mEGFP by counting the fluorescent spots on the cell surface under TIRF microscopy. (Note that the cRNA of Kv4.2 was very low (0.05 ng) for single molecule imaging, compared with the cRNA for electrophysiology (5 ng)). The number of Kv4.2-mEGFP spots showed a steep increase from 0.005 to 0.05 ng of cRNA of co-expressed KChIP4 (Fig. 1, D and E), which is well below the detection limit of Western blotting. Another large increment of expression was observed between 0.05 and 0.5 ng, although there were too many spots to count (Fig. 1D).FIGURE 3The recovery from inactivation of Kv4.2 is gradually accelerated with increasing expression of KChIP4.

A, representative current traces of Kv4.2 (5 ng), Kv4.2 (5 ng) with KChIP4 (0.5 ng), and Kv4.2 (5 ng) with KChIP4 (5 ng). The holding potential was at −80 mV. After a 500-ms hyperpolarization at −110 mV to remove the inactivation, the currents were elicited by depolarizing voltage steps for 1 s between −100 and +50 mV in 10-mV increments.

Error bars, S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined the biophysical properties of Kv4.2 with different amounts of KChIP4. The normalized I–V relationships were not changed by the amount of KChIP4 (Fig. 2A). This means that KChIP4 does not influence the voltage dependence of activation of Kv4.2. The steady-state inactivation curve shifted to depolarized potentials by increasing KChIP4. The amount of change in V½ was approximately +10 mV between Kv4.2 alone (−66.7 ± 2.2 mV; n = 3) and Kv4.2 (5 ng) with KChIP4 (10 ng) (−56.0 ± 1.3 mV; n = 5) (Fig. 2B). We also observed that the inactivation of Kv4.2 was decelerated with an increase in co-expressed KChIP4 (Fig. 1A). The inactivation kinetics at each potential from Kv4.2 (5 ng) with low KChIP4 expression (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 ng) were best fitted with a double exponential function, whereas the inactivation kinetics from Kv4.2 (5 ng) with high KChIP4 expression (2.5, 5, and 10 ng) were fitted with a single exponential function (Fig. 2C). When the currents were fitted with a double exponential function with low KChIP4 expression, the faster component was dominant at all membrane potentials studied (Fig. 2D). The faster inactivation time constant was increased with an increase in the amount of KChIP4 up to 2.5 ng, where the inactivation kinetics can be fitted with a single exponential function. We also investigated whether the expression level of KChIP4 affects the reco"
https://openalex.org/W2057173109,"Infection of non-enveloped polyomaviruses depends on an intact microtubular network. Here we focus on mouse polyomavirus (MPyV). We show that the dynamics of MPyV cytoplasmic transport reflects the characteristics of microtubular motor-driven transport with bi-directional saltatory movements. In cells treated with microtubule-disrupting agents, localization of MPyV was significantly perturbed, the virus was retained at the cell periphery, mostly within membrane structures resembling multicaveolar complexes, and at later times post-infection, only a fraction of the virus was found in Rab7-positive endosomes and multivesicular bodies. Inhibition of cytoplasmic dynein-based motility by overexpression of dynamitin affected perinuclear translocation of the virus, delivery of virions to the ER and substantially reduced the numbers of infected cells, while overexpression of dominant-negative form of kinesin-1 or kinesin-2 had no significant impact on virus localization and infectivity. We also found that transport along microtubules was important for MPyV-containing endosome sequential acquisition of Rab5, Rab7 and Rab11 GTPases. However, in contrast to dominant-negative mutant of Rab7 (T22N), overexpression of dominant-negative mutant Rab11 (S25N) did not affect the virus infectivity. Altogether, our study revealed that MPyV cytoplasmic trafficking leading to productive infection bypasses recycling endosomes, does not require the function of kinesin-1 and kinesin-2, but depends on functional dynein-mediated transport along microtubules for translocation of the virions from peripheral, often caveolin-positive compartments to late endosomes and ER - a prerequisite for efficient delivery of the viral genome to the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1966219770,"Diseases such as type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's share as common feature the accumulation of mis-folded disease-specific protein aggregates into fibrillar structures, or plaques. These fibrils may either be toxic by themselves, or act as reservoirs for smaller cytotoxic oligomers. This suggests to investigate molecules as potential therapeutics that either reduce fibril formation or increase fibril stability. One example is rat amylin, which can inhibit aggregation of human amylin, a hallmark of type 2 diabetes. In the present paper, we use molecular dynamics to compare the stability of various preformed aggregates, built out of either human amylin, rat amylin, or mixtures of both. We considered two types of fibril-like oligomers: a single-layer in-register conformation, and a double-layer conformation in which the first U-shaped layer consists of rat amylin and the second layer of human amylin. Our results explain the weak amyloid-inhibiting properties of rat amylin and suggest that membrane leakage due to pore formation is responsible for the toxicity of rat amylin observed in a recent experiment. Together, our results put in question the use of rat amylin or the similar FDA approved drug pramlintide as an inhibitor of human amylin aggregation. They also point to mixed human-rat amylin fibril-like oligomers as possible model-systems for studies of amyloid formation that involve cross-species transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2002402255,"The ability to target DNA methylation toward a single, user-designated CpG site in vivo may have wide applicability for basic biological and biomedical research. A tool for targeting methylation toward single sites could be used to study the effects of individual methylation events on transcription, protein recruitment to DNA, and the dynamics of such epigenetic alterations. Although various tools for directing methylation to promoters exist, none offers the ability to localize methylation solely to a single CpG site. In our ongoing research to create such a tool, we have pursued a strategy employing artificially bifurcated DNA methyltransferases; each methyltransferase fragment is fused to zinc finger proteins with affinity for sequences flanking a targeted CpG site for methylation. We sought to improve the targeting of these enzymes by reducing the methyltransferase activity at non-targeted sites while maintaining high levels of activity at a targeted site. Here we demonstrate an in vitro directed evolution selection strategy to improve methyltransferase specificity and use it to optimize an engineered zinc finger methyltransferase derived from M.SssI. The unusual restriction enzyme McrBC is a key component of this strategy and is used to select against methyltransferases that methylate multiple sites on a plasmid. This strategy allowed us to quickly identify mutants with high levels of methylation at the target site (up to ∼80%) and nearly unobservable levels of methylation at a off-target sites (<1%), as assessed in E. coli. We also demonstrate that replacing the zinc finger domains with new zinc fingers redirects the methylation to a new target CpG site flanked by the corresponding zinc finger binding sequences."

In this investigation, tobacco lines transgenic for individual WLm constructs containing the conserved motifs of the L RNA-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) gene of Watermelon silver mottle virus (WSMoV) were generated by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The WLm constructs included: (i) translatable WLm in a sense orientation; (ii) untranslatable WLmt with two stop codons; (iii) untranslatable WLmts with stop codons and a frame-shift; (iv) untranslatable antisense WLmA; and (v) WLmhp with an untranslatable inverted repeat of WLm containing the tospoviral S RNA 3'-terminal consensus sequence (5'-ATTGCTCT-3') and an NcoI site as a linker to generate a double-stranded hairpin transcript. A total of 46.7-70.0% transgenic tobacco lines derived from individual constructs showed resistance to the homologous WSMoV; 35.7-100% plants of these different WSMoV-resistant lines exhibited broad-spectrum resistance against four other serologically unrelated tospoviruses Tomato spotted wilt virus, Groundnut yellow spot virus, Impatiens necrotic spot virus and Groundnut chlorotic fan-spot virus. The selected transgenic tobacco lines also exhibited broad-spectrum resistance against five additional tospoviruses from WSMoV and Iris yellow spot virus clades, but not against RNA viruses from other genera. Northern analyses indicated that the broad-spectrum resistance is mediated by RNA silencing. To validate the L conserved region resistance in vegetable crops, the constructs were also used to generate transgenic tomato lines, which also showed effective resistance against WSMoV and other tospoviruses. Thus, our approach of using the conserved motifs of tospoviral L gene as a transgene generates broad-spectrum resistance against tospoviruses at the genus level."
https://openalex.org/W1977207224,"High lipoprotein expression and potent activation of host Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) are characteristic features of the staphylococcal species. Expression of TLR2 in the host is important for clearance of Staphylococcus aureus infection and host survival. Thus, we hypothesized that bacterial regulation of its intrinsic TLR2-stimulatory capacity could represent a means for immune evasion or host adaptation. We, therefore, compared clinical S. aureus isolates in regards to their TLR2 activation potential and assessed the bacterial factors that modulate TLR2-mediated recognition. S. aureus isolates displayed considerable variability in TLR2-activity with low to absent TLR2-activity in 64% of the isolates tested (68/106). Notably, strain-specific TLR2-activity was independent of the strain origin, e.g. no differences were found between strains isolated from respiratory specimen from cystic fibrosis patients or those isolated from invasive disease specimen. TLR2-activity correlated with protein A expression but not with the agr status. Capsule expression and small colony variant formation had a negative impact on TLR2-activity but any disruption of cell wall integrity enhanced TLR2 activation. Altogether, heterogeneity in host TLR2-activity reflects differences in metabolic activity and cell wall synthesis and/or remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2025950097,"Regulatory B cells (Bregs) are important in immune regulation. The factors that regulate Breg functions are less clear. Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) is capable of inducing hematopoietic stem cell differentiation. This study aimed to investigate the role of IGF2 in the development of Bregs and the enhancement of their function. In this study, the expression of IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) and IGF2R in ovalbumin (OVA)-specific B cells (OVAsBCs) was assessed by real time RT-PCR and Western blotting. The release of interleukin (IL)-10 from OVAsBCs and OVAsBC proliferation were assessed by enzyme-linked immunoassay and proliferation assay. The role of IGF2 in enhancing the function of OVAsBCs was tested with an intestinal allergic inflammation mouse model. The results showed that OVAsBCs expressed high levels of IGF2R. Exposure to both IGF2 and a specific antigen (Ag), OVA, markedly enhanced the expression of IL-10 in OVAsBCs as well as enhanced the IL-10(+) OVAsBC proliferation. The concurrent exposure to IGF2 and specific Ag markedly induced the IL-10 promoter DNA demethylation via activating the STAT5 pathway. IGF2 also enhanced both the OVAsBC proliferation in vivo and the effect of Ag-specific immunotherapy on inhibiting allergic inflammation in the intestine. We conclude that OVAsBCs express high levels of IGF2R and that IGF2 increases the expression of IL-10 in OVAsBCs and enhances OVAsBC proliferation and the inhibitory effect on allergic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2026816359,"The Hedgehog-GLI signaling pathway is active in a variety of human malignancies and is known to contribute to the growth and survival of human osteosarcoma cells. In this study, we examined the expression and regulation of GLI transcription factors in multiple canine osteosarcoma cell lines and analyzed the effects of inhibiting GLI with GANT61, a GLI-specific inhibitor. Compared with normal canine osteoblasts, real-time PCR showed that GLI1 and GLI2 were highly expressed in two out of three cell lines and correlated with downstream target gene expression of PTCH1and PAX6. Treatment of canine osteosarcoma cells with GANT61 resulted in decreased expression of GLI1, GLI2, PTCH1, and PAX6. Furthermore, GANT61 inhibited proliferation and colony formation in all three canine osteosarcoma cell lines. The finding that GLI signaling activity is present and active in canine osteosarcoma cells suggests that spontaneously arising osteosarcoma in dogs might serve as a good model for future preclinical testing of GLI inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2028384316,"Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a major cardiovascular risk factor. The electrocardiogram (ECG) has been shown to be a poor tool in detecting LVH due to cardiac and extracardiac factors. We studied the determinants and possibility of improving the test performance of the ECG in a group of Black Africans.We studied echocardiograms and electrocardiograms of 182 Cameroonian patients among whom 113 (62.1%) were having an echocardiographic LVH. Echocardiographic LVH was defined as Left Ventricular Mass Indexed to height 2.7(LVMI)>48 g/m2.7 in men, and >44 g/m 2.7 in women or Body Surface Area ≥116 g/m2 in men, and ≥96 g/m2 in women. Test performances were calculated for 6 classic ECG criteria Sokolow-Lyon, Cornell, Cornell product, Gubner-Ungerleiger, amplitudes of R in aVL, V5 and V6.The most sensitive criteria were Cornell (37.2%) and Sokolow-Lyon index (26.5%). The most specific criteria were Gubner (98.6%), RaVL (97.1%), RV5/V6 (95.7%) and Cornell product (94.2%). The performance of the ECG in diagnosing LVH significantly increased with the severity of LVH for Cornell index (r = 0.420, p<0.0001) and Sokolow index (r = 0.212, p = 0.002). It decreased with body habitus (r = -0.248, p = 0.001) for Sokolow-Lyon index. Cornell index was less affected (age p = 0.766; body habitus: p = 0.209). After sex-specific adjustment for BMI, Cornell BMI sensitivity increased from 37.2% to 69% (r = 0.472, p<0.0001), and Sokolow-Lyon BMI sensitivity increased from 26.5% to 58.4% (r = 0.270, p<0.001).The test performance of the ECG in diagnosing LVH is low in this Black African population, due to extracardiac factors such as age, sex, body habitus, and cardiac factors such as LVH severity and geometry. However, this performance is improved after adjustment for extracardiac factors."
https://openalex.org/W2085513422,"Several members of the SLC26 gene family have highly-restricted expression patterns in the auditory and vestibular periphery and mutations in mice of at least two of these (SLC26A4 and SLC26A5) lead to deficits in hearing and/or balance. A previous report pointed to SLC26A7 as a candidate gene important for cochlear function. In the present study, inner ears were assayed by immunostaining for Slc26a7 in neonatal and adult mice. Slc26a7 was detected in the basolateral membrane of Reissner’s membrane epithelial cells but not neighboring cells, with an onset of expression at P5; gene knockout resulted in the absence of protein expression in Reissner’s membrane. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings revealed anion currents and conductances that were elevated for NO3− over Cl− and inhibited by I− and NPPB. Elevated NO3− currents were absent in Slc26a7 knockout mice. There were, however, no major changes to hearing (auditory brainstem response) of knockout mice during early adult life under constitutive and noise exposure conditions. The lack of Slc26a7 protein expression found in the wild-type vestibular labyrinth was consistent with the observation of normal balance. We conclude that SLC26A7 participates in Cl− transport in Reissner’s membrane epithelial cells, but that either other anion pathways, such as ClC-2, possibly substitute satisfactorily under the conditions tested or that Cl− conductance in these cells is not critical to cochlear function. The involvement of SLC26A7 in cellular pH regulation in other epithelial cells leaves open the possibility that SLC26A7 is needed in Reissner’s membrane cells during local perturbations of pH."
https://openalex.org/W1998148685,"To investigate whether the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling induces myopic development by increasing the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 in guinea pigs.A translucent diffuser was glued onto the right eye to induce form-deprivation myopia (FDM) in 10 guinea pigs. Four guinea pigs were served as a control group. The other 100 guinea pigs were subdivided into 5 groups (20 per group) and received a 10 µl intravitreal injection every 2 days for 4 times. Two groups were injected with 20 or 50 µg/ml Shh amino-terminal peptide (Shh-N) into the right eye and 0.1% bovine serum albumin into the other. FDM was induced in the right eyes of the three cyclopamine-treated groups and both eyes were injected with 50, 100, or 200 µg/ml cyclopamine. Retinoscopic refraction and eye dimensions were assessed on Day 14 of treatment. MMP-2 protein expression was determined in both scleras by western blotting.Both concentrations of Shh-N stimulated myopic development and axial growth as compared with control eyes. Myopia and axial elongation were significantly greater in the 50 µg/ml than in the 20 µg/ml Shh-N group (P<0.001 and P = 0.0019, respectively). All three doses of cyclopamine significantly attenuated myopic development compared with the FDM group (P<0.0001). Cyclopamine at 100 or 200 µg/ml significantly reduced axial elongation compared with the FDM group (P = 0.044 and P = 0.001, respectively). FDM-induced myopia and axial elongation were significantly greater in the 50 µg/ml than in the 200 µg/ml cyclopamine group (P<0.0001 and P = 0.008, respectively). MMP-2 expression was significantly greater in Shh-N-treated eyes than in the control eyes, and was lower in the cyclopamine plus FDM groups than in the FDM group.The Shh signaling pathway induces myopic development by activating MMP-2 in guinea pigs."

Based on the enhancement of the fluorescent intensity of berberine hydrochloride, a new spectrofluorimetric method for the determination of BBH in the presence of β-CD was developed.

https://openalex.org/W2061933856,"Myxobolus cerebralis caused severe declines in rainbow trout populations across Colorado following its introduction in the 1980s. One promising approach for the recovery of Colorado’s rainbow trout populations has been the production of rainbow trout that are genetically resistant to the parasite. We introduced one of these resistant crosses, known as the GR×CRR (cross between the German Rainbow [GR] and Colorado River Rainbow [CRR] trout strains), to the upper Colorado River. The abundance, survival, and growth of the stocked GR×CRR population was examined to determine if GR×CRRs had contributed offspring to the age-0 population, and determine whether these offspring displayed increased resistance and survival characteristics compared to their wild CRR counterparts. Apparent survival of the introduced GR×CRR over the entire study period was estimated to be 0.007 (±0.001). Despite low survival of the GR×CRRs, age-0 progeny of the GR×CRR were encountered in years 2008 through 2011. Genetic assignments revealed a shift in the genetic composition of the rainbow trout fry population over time, with CRR fish comprising the entirety of the fry population in 2007, and GR-cross fish comprising nearly 80% of the fry population in 2011. A decrease in average infection severity (myxospores fish−1) was observed concurrent with the shift in the genetic composition of the rainbow trout fry population, decreasing from an average of 47,708 (±8,950) myxospores fish−1 in 2009 to 2,672 (±4,379) myxospores fish−1 in 2011. Results from this experiment suggest that the GR×CRR can survive and reproduce in rivers with a high prevalence of M. cerebralis. In addition, reduced myxospore burdens in age-0 fish indicated that stocking this cross may ultimately lead to an overall reduction in infection prevalence and severity in the salmonid populations of the upper Colorado River."
https://openalex.org/W2091656297,"Objective Lowering the blood concentration of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is the primary strategy employed in treating atherosclerotic disorders; however, most commonly prescribed statins prevent cardiovascular events in just 30% to 40% of treated patients. Therefore, additional treatment is required for patients in whom statins have been ineffective. In this study of atherosclerosis in rabbits, we examined the effect of probucol, a lipid-lowering drug with potent antioxidative effects, added to treatment with atorvastatin. Methods and Results Atherosclerosis was induced by feeding rabbits chow containing 0.5% cholesterol for 8 weeks. Probucol 0.1%, atorvastatin 0.001%, and atorvastatin 0.003% were administered solely or in combination for 6 weeks, beginning 2 weeks after the start of atherosclerosis induction. Atorvastatin decreased the plasma concentration of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDLC) dose-dependently; atorvastatin 0.003% decreased the plasma concentration of non-HDLC by 25% and the area of atherosclerotic lesions by 21%. Probucol decreased the plasma concentration of non-HDLC to the same extent as atorvastatin (i.e., by 22%) and the area of atherosclerotic lesions by 41%. Probucol with 0.003% atorvastatin decreased the plasma concentration of non-HDLC by 38% and the area of atherosclerotic lesions by 61%. Co-administration of probucol with atorvastatin did not affect the antioxidative effects of probucol, which were not evident on treatment with atorvastatin alone, such as prevention of in vitro LDL-oxidation, increase in paraoxonase-1 activity of HDL, and decreases in plasma and plaque levels of oxidized-LDL in vivo. Conclusions Probucol has significant add-on anti-atherosclerotic effects when combined with atorvastatin treatment; suggesting that this combination might be beneficial for treatment of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2009685783,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vif requires core binding factor β (CBF-β) to degrade the host APOBEC3 restriction factors. Although a minimum domain and certain amino acids of HIV-1 Vif, including hydrophobic residues at the N-terminal, have been identified as critical sites for binding with CBF-β, other regions that potentially mediate this interaction need to be further investigated. Here, we mapped two new regions of HIV-1 Vif that are required for interaction with CBF-β by generating a series of single-site or multiple-site Vif mutants and testing their effect on the suppression of APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F). A number of the mutants, including G84A/SIEW86-89AAAA (84/86-89), E88A/W89A (88/89), G84A, W89A, L106S and I107S in the 84GxSIEW89 and L102ADQLI107 regions, affected Vif function by disrupting CBF-β binding. These Vif mutants also had altered interactions with CUL5, since CBF-β is known to facilitate the binding of Vif to CUL5. We further showed that this effect was not due to misfolding or conformational changes in Vif, as the mutants still maintained their interactions with other factors such as ElonginB, A3G and A3F. Notably, G84D and D104A had stronger effects on the Vif-CUL5 interaction than on the Vif-CBF-β interaction, indicating that they mainly influenced the CUL5 interaction and implying that the interaction of Vif with CUL5 contributes to the binding of Vif to CBF-β. These new binding interfaces with CBF-β in HIV-1 Vif provide novel targets for the development of HIV-1 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2110146630,"Background The aim of the study is the analysis of years of life lost due to external causes of death, particularly due to traffic accidents and suicides. Materials and Methods The study material includes a database containing information gathered from 376,281 death certificates of inhabitants of the Lodz province who died between 1999 and 2010. The Lodz province is characterized by the highest mortality rates in Poland. The SEYLLp (Standard Expected Years of Life Lost per living person) and the SEYLLd (per death) indices were used to determine years of life lost. Joinpoint models were used to analyze time trends. Results In 2010, deaths due to external causes constituted 6.0% of the total number of deaths. The standardized death rate (SDR) due to external causes was 110.0 per 100,000 males and was five times higher than for females (22.0 per 100,000 females). In 2010, the SEYLLp due to external causes was 3746 per 100,000 males and 721 per 100,000 females. Among males, suicides and traffic accidents were the most common causes of death (the values of the SEYLLp were: 1098 years and 887 years per 100,000 people, respectively). Among females, the SEYLLp values were 183 years due to traffic accidents and 143 years due to suicides (per 100,000 people). Conclusions A decrease in the number of years of life lost due to external causes is much higher among females. The authors observe that a growing number of suicides contribute to an increase in the value of the SEYLLp index. This directly contributes to over-mortality of males due to external causes. The analysis of the years of life lost focuses on the social and economic aspects of premature mortality due to external causes."
https://openalex.org/W2057905110,"Human cells migrate between mother and fetus during pregnancy and persist in the respective host for long-term after birth. Fetal microchimerism occurs also in twins sharing a common placenta or chorion. Whether microchimerism occurs in multiparous mammals such as the domestic pig, where fetuses have separate placentas and chorions, is not well understood. Here, we assessed cell chimerism in litters of wild-type sows inseminated with semen of transposon transgenic boars. Segregation of three independent monomeric transposons ensured an excess of transgenic over non-transgenic offspring in every litter. Transgenic siblings (n = 35) showed robust ubiquitous expression of the reporter transposon encoding a fluorescent protein, and provided an unique resource to assess a potential cell trafficking to non-transgenic littermates (n = 7) or mothers (n = 4). Sensitive flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and real-time PCR provided no evidence for microchimerism in porcine littermates, or piglets and their mothers in both blood and solid organs. These data indicate that the epitheliochorial structure of the porcine placenta effectively prevents cellular exchange during gestation."
https://openalex.org/W2135917539,"DNA damage has been thought to be directly associated with the neoplastic progression by enabling mutations in tumor suppressor genes and activating/and amplifying oncogenes ultimately resulting in genomic instability. DNA damage causes activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) that is an important cellular mechanism for maintaining genomic integrity in the face of genotoxic stress. While the cellular response to genotoxic stress has been extensively studied in cancer models, less is known about the cellular response to oncogenic stress in the premalignant context. In the present study, by using breast tissues samples from women at different risk levels for invasive breast cancer (normal, proliferative breast disease and ductal carcinoma in situ) we found that DNA damage is inversely correlated with risk of invasive breast cancer. Similarly, in MCF10A based in vitro model system where we recapitulated high DNA damage conditions as seen in patient samples by stably cloning in cyclin E, we found that high levels of oncogene induced DNA damage, by triggering inhibition of a major proliferative pathway (AKT), inhibits cell growth and causes cells to die through autophagy. These data suggest that AKT-mTOR pathway is a novel component of oncogene induced DNA damage response in immortalized 'normal-like' breast cells and its suppression may contribute to growth arrest and arrest of the breast tumorigenesis."

Methodology/principal findings Field survey was conducted in the natural Pinus koraiensis mixed forests along a latitudinal gradient and an elevational gradient in Northeast China. In order to build the mathematical models for simulating the relationships of compositional and structural attributes of the Pinus koraiensis mixed forest with climatic and non-climatic factors, stepwise linear regression analyses were performed, incorporating 14 dependent variables and the linear and quadratic components of 9 factors. All the selected new models were computed under the +2°C and +10% precipitation and +4°C and +10% precipitation scenarios. The Max Temperature of Warmest Month, Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter and Precipitation of Wettest Month were observed to be key climatic factors controlling the stand densities and total basal areas of Pinus koraiensis mixed forest. Increased summer temperatures and precipitations strongly enhanced the stand densities and total basal areas of broadleaf trees but had little effect on Pinus koraiensis under the +2°C and +10% precipitation scenario and +4°C and +10% precipitation scenario. Conclusions/significance These results show that the Max Temperature of Warmest Month, Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter and Precipitation of Wettest Month are key climatic factors which shape the composition and structure of Pinus koraiensis mixed forest. Although the Pinus koraiensis would persist, the current forests dominated by Pinus koraiensis in the region would all shift and become broadleaf-dominated forests due to the dramatic increase of broadleaf trees under the future global warming and increased precipitation."
https://openalex.org/W2082031896,"The synchronization transitions in Newman-Watts small-world neuronal networks (SWNNs) induced by time delay and long-range connection (LRC) probability have been investigated by synchronization parameter and space-time plots. Four distinct parameter regions, that is, asynchronous region, transition region, synchronous region, and oscillatory region have been discovered at certain LRC probability as time delay is increased. Interestingly, desynchronization is observed in oscillatory region. More importantly, we consider the spatiotemporal patterns obtained in delayed Newman-Watts SWNNs are the competition results between long-range drivings (LRDs) and neighboring interactions. In addition, for moderate time delay, the synchronization of neuronal network can be enhanced remarkably by increasing LRC probability. Furthermore, lag synchronization has been found between weak synchronization and complete synchronization as LRC probability is a little less than 1.0. Finally, the two necessary conditions, moderate time delay and large numbers of LRCs, are exposed explicitly for synchronization in delayed Newman-Watts SWNNs."
https://openalex.org/W2142763130,"Endometrial cancer (EC) contributes substantially to total burden of cancer morbidity and mortality in the United States. Family history is a known risk factor for EC, thus genetic factors may play a role in EC pathogenesis. Three previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found only one locus associated with EC, suggesting that common variants with large effects may not contribute greatly to EC risk. Alternatively, we hypothesize that rare variants may contribute to EC risk. We conducted an exome-wide association study (EXWAS) of EC using the Infinium HumanExome BeadChip in order to identify rare variants associated with EC risk. We successfully genotyped 177,139 variants in a multiethnic population of 1,055 cases and 1,778 controls from four studies that were part of the Epidemiology of Endometrial Cancer Consortium (E2C2). No variants reached global significance in the study, suggesting that more power is needed to detect modest associations between rare genetic variants and risk of EC."

https://openalex.org/W2059759200,"Glutamine transport between tissues is important for the outcome of critically ill patients. Investigation of glutamine kinetics is, therefore, necessary to understand glutamine metabolism in these patients in order to improve future intervention studies. Endogenous glutamine production can be measured by continuous infusion of a glutamine tracer, which necessitates a minimum measurement time period. In order to reduce this problem, we used and validated a tracer bolus injection method. Furthermore, this method was used to measure the glutamine production in healthy volunteers in the post-absorptive state, with extra alanine and with glutamine supplementation and parenteral nutrition. Healthy volunteers received a bolus injection of [1-13C] glutamine, and blood was collected from the radial artery to measure tracer enrichment over 90 minutes. Endogenous rate of appearance (endoRa) of glutamine was calculated from the enrichment decay curve and corrected for the extra glutamine supplementation. The glutamine endoRa of healthy volunteers was 6.1±0.9 µmol/kg/min in the post-absorptive state, 6.9±1.0 µmol/kg/min with extra alanyl-glutamine (p = 0.29 versus control), 6.1±0.4 µmol/kg/min with extra alanine only (p = 0.32 versus control), and 7.5±0.9 µmol/kg/min with extra alanyl-glutamine and parenteral nutrition (p = 0.049 versus control). In conclusion, a tracer bolus injection method to measure glutamine endoRa showed good reproducibility and small variation at baseline as well as during parenteral nutrition. Additionally, we showed that parenteral nutrition including alanyl-glutamine increased glutamine endoRa in healthy volunteers, which was not attributable to the alanine part of the dipeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1975548114,"The coat color of mammals is determined by the melanogenesis pathway, which is responsible for maintaining the balance between black-brown eumelanin and yellow-reddish pheomelanin. It is also believed that the color of the bovine muzzle is regulated in a similar manner; however, the molecular mechanism underlying pigment deposition in the dark-muzzle has yet to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to identify melanogenesis-associated genes that are differentially expressed in the dark vs. light muzzle of native Korean cows. Using microarray clustering and real-time polymerase chain reaction techniques, we observed that the expression of genes involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Wnt signaling pathways is distinctively regulated in the dark and light muzzle tissues. Differential expression of tyrosinase was also noticed, although the difference was not as distinct as those of MAPK and Wnt. We hypothesize that emphasis on the MAPK pathway in the dark-muzzle induces eumelanin synthesis through the activation of cAMP response element-binding protein and tyrosinase, while activation of Wnt signaling counteracts this process and raises the amount of pheomelanin in the light-muzzle. We also found 2 novel genes (GenBank No. NM-001076026 and XM-588439) with increase expression in the black nose, which may provide additional information about the mechanism of nose pigmentation. Regarding the increasing interest in the genetic diversity of cattle stocks, genes we identified for differential expression in the dark vs. light muzzle may serve as novel markers for genetic diversity among cows based on the muzzle color phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1965403815,"Although the naturally occurring atmospheric noble gases He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe possess great potential as tracers for studying gas exchange in living beings, no direct analytical technique exists for simultaneously determining the absolute concentrations of these noble gases in body fluids in vivo. In this study, using human blood as an example, the absolute concentrations of all stable atmospheric noble gases were measured simultaneously by combining and adapting two analytical methods recently developed for geochemical research purposes. The partition coefficients determined between blood and air, and between blood plasma and red blood cells, agree with values from the literature. While the noble-gas concentrations in the plasma agree rather well with the expected solubility equilibrium concentrations for air-saturated water, the red blood cells are characterized by a distinct supersaturation pattern, in which the gas excess increases in proportion to the atomic mass of the noble-gas species, indicating adsorption on to the red blood cells. This study shows that the absolute concentrations of noble gases in body fluids can be easily measured using geochemical techniques that rely only on standard materials and equipment, and for which the underlying concepts are already well established in the field of noble-gas geochemistry."
https://openalex.org/W1976954316,"We study the effect that conjugation-mediated Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) has on the mutation-selection balance of a population in a static environment. We consider a model whereby a population of unicellular organisms, capable of conjugation, comes to mutation-selection balance in the presence of an antibiotic, which induces a first-order death rate constant [Formula: see text] for genomes that are not resistant. We explicitly take into consideration the repression/de-repression dynamics of the conjugative plasmid, and assume that a de-repressed plasmid remains temporarily de-repressed after copying itself into another cell. We assume that both repression and de-repression are characterized by first-order rate constants [Formula: see text]and [Formula: see text], respectively. We find that conjugation has a deleterious effect on the mean fitness of the population, suggesting that HGT does not provide a selective advantage in a static environment, but is rather only useful for adapting to new environments. This effect can be ameliorated by repression, suggesting that while HGT is not necessarily advantageous for a population in a static environment, its deleterious effect on the mean fitness can be negated via repression. Therefore, it is likely that HGT is much more advantageous in a dynamic landscape. Furthermore, in the limiting case of a vanishing spontaneous de-repression rate constant, we find that the fraction of conjugators in the population undergoes a phase transition as a function of population density. Below a critical population density, the fraction of conjugators is zero, while above this critical population density the fraction of conjugators rises continuously to one. Our model for conjugation-mediated HGT is related to models of infectious disease dynamics, where the conjugators play the role of the infected (I) class, and the non-conjugators play the role of the susceptible (S) class."
https://openalex.org/W1998670897,"In a recent attempt to crystallize a regulator of MexAB-OprM multi-drug efflux systems in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NalD), we found that adding polyethylene glycol (PEG3350, Mw = 3,350 g/mol) into the protein solution increases the speed of NalD migration in gel electrophoresis, signaling a smaller hydrodynamic size. At first we conjectured that NalD was degraded unexpectedly by PEG; however, we found that there was no change in its molar mass by MALDI-TOF characterization. Moreover, we found that adding polyacrylic acid (PAA) into the solution mixture returned the NalD migration to its normal speed. Furthermore, our analytic ultracentrifugation and dynamic laser light scattering results directly reveal that NalD interacts with PEG so that individual NalD chains gradually shrink as more PEG chains are added in the range of 10-50 mg/mL. Size exclusion chromatography also confirms that the NalD chain shrinks in the presence of PEG. A combination of these results indicates that PEG3350 chains can complex with NalD to induce an intra-protein chain contraction, presumably via the formation of hydrogen bond between -C-O-C- on PEG and -COOH on NalD, resulting in a smaller hydrodynamic size (faster migration) and a higher apparent molar mass. Note that because the presence of PEG affects osmotic pressure, it is considered to be a precipitator of protein crystallization. Our current finding reveals that the interaction of PEG/protein may play a significant role in protein crystallization. The complexation potentially makes the protein chain segments less flexible, and consequently makes crystallization easier. Hopefully, our current results will stimulate further studies in this direction."
https://openalex.org/W2159893527,"The Ferric uptake regulatory protein (Fur) is a transcriptional regulatory protein that functions to control gene transcription in response to iron in a number of pathogenic bacteria. In this study, we applied a label-free, quantitative and high-throughput analysis method, Interferometric Reflectance Imaging Sensor (IRIS), to rapidly characterize Fur-DNA interactions in vitro with predicted Fur binding sequences in the genome of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea. IRIS can easily be applied to examine multiple protein-protein, protein-nucleotide and nucleotide-nucleotide complexes simultaneously and demonstrated here that seventy percent of the predicted Fur boxes in promoter regions of iron-induced genes bound to Fur in vitro with a range of affinities as observed using this microarray screening technology. Combining binding data with mRNA expression levels in a gonococcal fur mutant strain allowed us to identify five new gonococcal genes under Fur-mediated direct regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2092996894,"Conditional regulation of gene expression is a powerful and indispensable method for analyzing gene function. The “Tet-On” system is a tool widely used for that purpose. Here, the transregulator rtTA mediates expression of a gene of interest after addition of the small molecule effector doxycycline. Although very effective in rapidly turning on gene expression, the system is hampered by the long half-life of doxycycline which makes shutting down gene expression rapidly very difficult to achieve. We isolated an rtTA-binding peptide by in vivo selection that acts as a doxycycline antagonist and leads to rapid and efficient shut down of rtTA-mediated reporter gene expression in a human cell line. This peptide represents the basis for novel effector molecules which complement the “Tet-system” by enabling the investigator to rapidly turn gene expression not just on at will, but now also off."
https://openalex.org/W2062540826,"Microvascular disease leads to alterations of cerebral vasculature including the formation of microembolic (ME) strokes. Though ME are associated with changes in mood and the severity and progression of cognitive decline, the effect of ME strokes on cerebral microstructure and its relationship to behavioral endpoints is unknown. Here, we used adult and aged male rats to test the hypotheses that ME lesions result in subtle changes to white and gray matter integrity as detected by high-throughput diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and that these structural disruptions correspond to behavioral deficits. Two weeks post-surgery, aged animals showed depressive-like behaviors in the sucrose consumption test in the absence of altered cerebral diffusivity as assessed by ex-vivo DTI. Furthermore, DTI indices did not correlate with the degree of behavioral disruption in aged animals or in a subset of animals with observed tissue cavitation and subtle DTI alterations. Together, data suggest that behavioral deficits are not the result of damage to brain regions or white matter tracts, rather the activity of other systems may underlie functional disruption and recovery."
