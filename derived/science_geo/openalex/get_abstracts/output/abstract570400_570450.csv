To investigate this, we used high-resolution confocal and super-resolution (STORM) microscopy in AD-like mice and human AD tissue. We found that microglia processes, rich in TREM2, tightly surround early amyloid fibrils and plaques promoting their compaction and insulation. In Trem2- or DAP12-haplodeficient mice and in humans with R47H TREM2 mutations, microglia had a markedly reduced ability to envelop amyloid deposits. This led to an increase in less compact plaques with longer and branched amyloid fibrils resulting in greater surface exposure to adjacent neurites. This was associated with more severe neuritic tau hyperphosphorylation and axonal dystrophy around amyloid deposits.

Microglia are the resident immune cells in the CNS, where they constantly survey their microenvironment and become activated in various neurological disorders (Davalos et al., 2005Davalos D.

In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a striking feature of microglia is their universal clustering around amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits, one of the major pathological hallmarks of this condition. It has traditionally been thought that activated microglia remove Aβ deposits via phagocytosis (Lee and Landreth, 2010Lee C.Y.D. Landreth G.E. The role of microglia in amyloid clearance from the AD brain.J Neural Transm (Vienna). 2010; 117: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). However, multiple recent lines of evidence indicate that microglia are ineffective at removing fibrillar Aβ in vivo (Condello et al., 2011Condello C. Schain A. Grutzendler J.

At the same time, given their ability to secrete cytokines and reactive oxygen species, microglia have the potential to be neurotoxic (Block et al., 2007Block M.L. Zecca L. Hong J.-S. Microglia-mediated neurotoxicity: uncovering the molecular mechanisms.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains unknown whether certain aspects of microglial function play beneficial or detrimental roles that could be important for disease pathogenesis. TREM2 (Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2) gene is specifically expressed by microglia in the CNS (Schmid et al., 2002Schmid C.D. Sautkulis L.N. Danielson P.E. Cooper J. Hasel K.W.

A loss-of-function R47H (rs75932628, Arginine-47-Histidine) mutation in TREM2 constitutes one of the strongest single allele genetic risk factors for AD (Guerreiro et al., 2013Guerreiro R. Wojtas A.

While loss of Trem2 in vitro disrupts Aβ phagocytosis by microglia (Kleinberger et al., 2014Kleinberger G. Yamanishi Y. Suárez-Calvet M. Czirr E. Lohmann E. Cuyvers E. Struyfs H. Pettkus N.

Thus, it remains unclear to what extent Trem2 regulates microglia phagocytosis in vivo, suggesting that the increased risk of AD in Trem2 haplodeficiency may not be due to differences in amyloid plaque load. Interestingly, most studies in Trem2-deficient AD-like mice have shown reduced number of microglia around amyloid plaques (Jay et al., 2015Jay T.R. Miller C.M. Cheng P.J. Graham L.C. Bemiller S. Broihier M.L. Xu G. Margevicius D. Karlo J.C. Sousa G.L. et al.TREM2 deficiency eliminates TREM2+ inflammatory macrophages and ameliorates pathology in Alzheimer’s disease mouse models.J. Exp.

However, it remains unknown how subtle changes in microglia around plaques could profoundly increase the risk of AD. Furthermore, it remains unclear how these mouse studies correlate with the human pathology. Recently, we identified a protective function of microglia, whereby their processes tightly wrap around plaques and act as a physical barrier that prevents the outward extension of amyloid fibrils (Condello et al., 2015Condello C. Yuan P. Schain A. Grutzendler J. Microglia constitute a barrier that prevents neurotoxic protofibrillar Aβ42 hotspots around plaques.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6176Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). This barrier function promotes formation of highly compact plaque microregions that have minimal affinity for soluble Aβ42 (Figure S1). Conversely, areas not covered by microglia processes display hotspots with very high soluble Aβ42 affinity, leading to markedly concentrated protofibrillar Aβ plaque regions. These Aβ hotspots are neurotoxic given that adjacent axons develop a greater extent of dystrophy compared to those next to non-hotspot regions covered by microglia (Condello et al., 2015Condello C. Yuan P. Schain A. Grutzendler J. Microglia constitute a barrier that prevents neurotoxic protofibrillar Aβ42 hotspots around plaques.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6176Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Despite these intriguing observations in mice, the importance of microglia in the pathogenesis of AD and more specifically the relevance of this newly discovered microglial barrier function in humans has not been demonstrated. We thus hypothesized that disruption of the microglia barrier function is a cellular mechanism underlying association between loss-of-function TREM2 mutations and increased risk of AD. To test this, we used quantitative high-resolution confocal microscopy and super-resolution Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) in both human brains of patients with R47H TREM2 mutations and in AD-like mice lacking either Trem2 or its adaptor protein DNAX-binding protein of 12 kDa (DAP12). This revealed unprecedented structural detail of the landscape of amyloid fibrils, axonal dystrophy, and microglia heterogeneity around plaques in TREM2 haplodeficiency. Our data in mice and humans indicate that microglia processes closely interact with individual amyloid fibrils in early non-compact filamentous plaques and later form specialized protrusions rich in TREM2 and DAP12 that tightly wrap around the surface of compact plaques. We then demonstrate in both TREM2 and DAP12 haplodeficiency a striking microglia phenotype in which these cells fail to polarize and engage nascent amyloid fibrils and mature compact plaques. However, this was not associated with differences in amyloid phagocytosis or plaque numbers. Instead, we observed a marked reduction in amyloid plaque compaction and a subsequent increase in plaque surface area contacting neuropil, which was associated with a significant increase in the degree of axonal dystrophy. A strikingly similar phenotype was also observed in human TREM2 R47H mutants, demonstrating that this neuroprotective microglia barrier is conserved in humans. Our data indicate that TREM2 deficiency disrupts this specialized barrier function and may thus constitute a previously unknown cellular mechanism linking TREM2 R47H variant with increased risk of dementia. Future studies may determine whether similar mechanisms play a role in the pathogenesis of late-onset AD associated with other microglia-related genetic risk alleles. We first examined the expression pattern of Trem2 in the brains of three transgenic AD mouse models. Building upon previous reports (Frank et al., 2008Frank S. Burbach G.J. Bonin M. Walter M.

Interestingly, we found that Trem2 expression was exceptionally high at the leading edges of microglia processes directly contacting amyloid plaques (Figures 1A–1C). We also detected polarized expression of its signaling adaptor protein DAP12 (Figure 1D), and a marker of phosphorylated tyrosine (Figure 1E) consistent with downstream kinase-mediated signal transduction (Colonna, 2003Colonna M. TREMs in the immune system and beyond.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Similar to mice, in postmortem human brain, we found enhanced DAP12 expression specifically polarized to microglia processes contacting amyloid plaques (Figure 1F and Table S1). The robust enrichment of Trem2, DAP12, and a marker of downstream tyrosine phosphorylation suggests that these signaling proteins could play a key role in the envelopment of the plaque surface by microglia processes and the establishment of the microglia barrier (Figure 1G). We next examined structural and functional features of microglia in AD-like transgenic mice carrying different copy numbers of the Trem2 or DAP12 genes (Figures 2, S2, and S4). High-resolution confocal microscopy revealed that Trem2 or DAP12 deletion markedly reduced the degree of plaque surface coverage by microglia processes (Figures 2A–2D). The dramatic change of plaque coverage in Trem2 and DAP12 deficiency cannot be explained alone by the modest ∼20% reduction in the number of plaque-associated microglia (Figures S3 and S4). Instead, it appears that microglia in Trem2 or DAP12 deficiency have an impairment in the ability to polarize their processes toward the plaque surface and thus are unable to create an effective barrier around them (Figures 2A–2D). Interestingly, in Trem2 deficiency, microglia processes contacting plaques did not show enrichment of phosphorylated tyrosine (Figure S3), a marker of downstream tyrosine kinase activation that is potentially necessary for triggering actin reorganization during process polarization (Peng et al., 2010Peng Q. Malhotra S. Torchia J.A. Kerr W.G. Coggeshall K.M. Humphrey M.B. TREM2- and DAP12-dependent activation of PI3K requires DAP10 and is inhibited by SHIP1.Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra38Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Indeed, contrary to the robust microglia processes seen in wild-type mice (Figure 2E), processes contacting plaques in either Trem2- or DAP12-deficient mice displayed characteristic dysmorphic features with fine processes and terminal loops that failed to closely track the boundaries of the plaque (Figure 2F). Thus, Trem2 likely plays a critical role in signaling microglia process specialization underlying the formation of the microglia barrier around plaques. To assess whether Trem2 deficiency also affected Aβ fibril engulfment by microglia, we performed immunohistochemistry and quantitative confocal image analysis to measure the Aβ content within CD68-immunolabeled microglial phagosomes, a correlate of Aβ phagocytosis efficiency. While in Trem2−/− mice, there was a significant reduction in Aβ phagocytosis, we were surprised to see that in Trem2+/− mice, a more relevant model of human TREM2 haplodeficiency leading to AD, there was no significant difference in either the number of phagosomes or amount of Aβ within phagosomes (Figures 2G and 2H). This suggests that a defect in microglia phagocytosis of Aβ is not the main cause of neuropathology in Trem2 deficiency. Instead it suggests that inability of microglia processes to polarize and establish an effective barrier may be a neuropathological mechanism in TREM2 R47H variant carriers. We next asked how deficiency in the microglia barrier may impact the structural organization of individual plaques. Quantitative confocal analyses of individual plaques labeled by the β sheet binding dye thioflavin S, in Trem2- and DAP12-deficient mice, showed a reduction in the fluorescence and a diffuse plaque morphology with amyloid fibrils projecting outward radially (Figures 3A–3C). To directly observe Aβ fibrils, we next performed super-resolution nanoscopy using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) in brain slices fluorescently immunolabeled with an N terminus anti-Aβ antibody. While plaques from Trem2+/+ mice exhibited circumscribed borders, in Trem2+/− and Trem2−/− mice, plaques displayed spike-like fibrils extending radially (Figure 3D). We then defined three different plaque regions based on Aβ fibril organization: (1) diffuse region; (2) mesh-like region (likely formed by interweaving of individual Aβ fibrils); and (3) compact region (where densely packed fibrils limit antibody penetration (Figures 3E and S5). Trem2 deficiency markedly increased the proportion of diffuse fibrils and decreased the proportion of mesh-like and compact fibrils (Figure 3F). Furthermore, loss of Trem2 increased the average length of diffuse fibrils radiating outward from the mesh-like compact core (Figures 3G and 3H) (average 231 nm in Trem2+/+, 396 nm in Trem2+/−, and 442 nm in Trem2−/−). This suggests that the microglia barrier prevents the radial extension of β-amyloid fibrils, promoting their intermingling and formation of mesh-like structures with various degrees of compaction. The longer amyloid fibers, coupled with their increased branching at the nano scale (Figure 4G), lead to a marked increase in fibril surface area in Trem2 deficiency (see Supplemental Information). To explore the role of microglia and TREM2 deficiency in the earliest stages of amyloid deposition in mice, we obtained high-resolution confocal images of clusters of thioflavin S-positive fibrils that lacked a dense core, which we termed filamentous plaques (Figure 4A). Interestingly, we observed that these plaques were highly intermingled with microglia processes (Figure 4A). Processes that directly contacted thioflavin S-positive amyloid filaments were highly enriched in Trem2 (Figure 4B). These processes appeared to closely wrap around individual amyloid filaments as evidenced by the fact that the membrane-bound Trem2 was highly colocalized with the filaments, while the parent microglia branches filled with cytoplasmic Iba1 were immediately adjacent (Figure 4C). We also observed instances in which more mesh-like clusters of fibrils were fully wrapped by fine Trem2-positive microglia processes that appeared to cap individual fibril endings. (Figure 4D). This suggests that these early interactions between microglia processes and amyloid filaments could be of importance in determining the degree of fibril compaction. To explore this possibility, we examined the nanostructures within diffuse fibrils revealed by super-resolution STORM imaging. Within individual plaques, we observed fibrils with variable widths ranging from 30 nm (about the resolution limit of our STORM imaging) to 160 nm (Figures 4E and 4F). Consistent with atomic-force microscopy data in vitro (Stine et al., 1996Stine Jr., W.B. Snyder S.W. Ladror U.S. Wade W.S. Miller M.F. Perun T.J. Holzman T.F. Krafft G.A. The nanometer-scale structure of amyloid-beta visualized by atomic force microscopy.J. Protein Chem. 1996; 15: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), this suggests that Aβ fibrils coil together to form bundle-like structures of different widths in vivo. Interestingly, Trem2 deficiency led to an increased proportion of thin fibril bundles (∼40 nm) and decreased proportion of thicker ones (average 68 nm in Trem2+/+, 57 nm in Trem2+/−, and 48 nm in Trem2−/−) (Figure 4G). Furthermore, we observed branched structures extending orthogonally from the main Aβ fibril bundle (Figure 4H), which were markedly increased in plaques from Trem2-deficient mice (Figure 4I). Together, the increased numbers of diffuse thin fibers projecting outward for greater lengths and the increased orthogonal branches, implies that the surface-to-volume ratio of amyloid fibers in Trem2-deficient mice is significantly greater than in wild-type mice (we estimate an ∼300%–400% increase; see Supplemental Information). This phenomenon would be predicted to dramatically increase the contact area between amyloid fibrils and the adjacent exposed cellular structures. Importantly, while the total number of amyloid plaques was not significantly different between Trem2-deficient and wild-type mice (Figure 4J and Figure S3), we observed a significant increase in the proportion of filamentous plaques in both Trem2+/− and Trem2−/− mice (Figure 4J). The increase in filamentous plaques coupled with the greater surface area of individual plaques in Trem2+/− mice may lead to worsened neurotoxicity. To directly test the degree of neurotoxicity, we measured the volume of axonal dystrophy around individual amyloid plaques using immunohistochemistry for Lamp1, a lysosomal protein highly enriched in dystrophic neurites (DN) that serves as a reliable marker for quantitative DN measurements (Condello et al., 2015Condello C. Yuan P. Schain A. Grutzendler J. Microglia constitute a barrier that prevents neurotoxic protofibrillar Aβ42 hotspots around plaques.Nat.

USA. 2015; 112: E3699-E3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). We classified plaques by morphology and size with specific attention to early filamentous plaques that were surprisingly associated with a massive amount of dystrophic neurites (Figures 5A and 5B ). We found that Trem2 or DAP12+/− and DAP12−/− mice had a much greater degree of axonal dystrophy than wild-type mice (Figures 5C and 5D). Interestingly, the main difference in dystrophy occurred in non-compact filamentous and small compact plaques (up to 6 μm in diameter), suggesting that the protective effect of microglia is most effective at early stages of plaque evolution. Given that filamentous plaques are associated with a surprisingly large degree of axonal dystrophy (Figure 5B), a shift of the distribution toward filamentous plaques could have critical effects on the overall degree of neural circuit disruption at early stages of amyloid accumulation. To determine whether our findings in mice are relevant for human AD pathogenesis, we next characterized the microglia and plaque phenotypes in postmortem human brains from sporadic late onset AD cases and patients with R47H TREM2 variant. Consistent with previous reports on late-onset AD, we observed different types of plaque morphologies using anti-Aβ immunolabeling (4G8) and thioflavin S (TS) staining (Figure 6A). We classified them into four categories: (1) diffuse plaques: diffuse 4G8+ fibrils lacking TS labeling; (2) filamentous plaques: 4G8+ halo and filamentous TS labeling with no plaque core; (3) compact plaques: 4G8+ halo and TS-labeled core; and (4) inert: TS-labeled core with no 4G8 halo. Interestingly, microglia processes did not display any polarization toward diffuse plaques but showed enlarged processes that robustly intermingled with both filamentous and compact plaques (Figures 6A and 6B). Moreover, plaques that had a TS-labeled core with no 4G8 halo had very few microglia processes (Figure 6A) or dystrophic neurites (Figure 7A) around them, which motivated us to call them inert. We next quantified the relative proportions of these plaque categories in AD cases with and without the R47H TREM2 mutation (Table S2). While we did not find a significant difference in the overall microglia density or amyloid plaque burden between genotypes (Figure S6), we did observe a robust increase in the proportion of plaques with filamentous morphology (Figure 6C). Remarkably, we observed a marked reduction in the number of surrounding microglia in both filamentous and compact plaques but we saw no significant microglia differences around diffuse and inert plaques (Figure 6C) or in non-plaque regions (Figure S6). Thus, the R47H mutation in humans leads to a specific defect of microglia plaque engagement, which is strikingly similar to the phenotype in Trem2- and DAP12-haplodeficient mice. We then sought to determine how the observed decrease in microglia numbers in R47H mutants impacts their capacity for envelopment of individual filaments and plaque cores. Like in mice, we observed that microglia processes infiltrated filamentous plaques and had a tendency to surround individual filaments (Figure 6D). In contrast, microglia around compact plaques projected robust processes that closely enveloped the plaque surface (Figure 6E). Interestingly, while microglia in R47H mutants were able to send processes toward amyloid deposits, these appeared to be less robust and did not tightly engage with individual fibrils or the plaque surface, leading to a markedly diminished microglia coverage of amyloid aggregates (Figures 6F–6H). Thus, TREM2 in humans likely regulates the microglia barrier function and disruption of this function in R47H mutants is associated with inability of microglia for enveloping fibrils or amyloid deposits. To determine the consequences of a deficient microglia barrier in human AD with R47H TREM2 variant, we quantified the extent of axonal dystrophy around individual plaques. Similar to mice, we found that filamentous plaques lacking a core had a surprisingly large number of dystrophic axons, as visualized by anti-APP immunohistochemistry (Figure 7A). Interestingly, we found a dramatic increase in axonal dystrophy around both filamentous and small compact plaques in R47H mutants compared to sporadic non mutant AD cases (Figure 7B). These dystrophic swellings were associated with marked cytoskeletal abnormalities as evidenced by the extensive neuritic labeling with anti-phosphotau antibody around both filamentous and compact amyloid deposits (Figure 7C). Similar to our results quantifying APP-positive dystrophic neurites, phosphotau labeling was markedly increased in R47H AD brains compared to sporadic AD cases (Figure 7D). Consistent with our previous findings in mice (Condello et al., 2015Condello C. Yuan P. Schain A. Grutzendler J. Microglia constitute a barrier that prevents neurotoxic protofibrillar Aβ42 hotspots around plaques.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6176Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) (Figure S1), we observed a strong anti-colocalization between microglia processes and hyperphosphorylated tau-positive dystrophic neurites (Figures 7E and 7F), suggesting that microglia normally exert a protective insulating effect. This function is disrupted in R47H mutants as demonstrated by a significantly reduced degree and robustness of microglia plaque coverage associated with increased neuritic abnormalities (Figure 7G). Our study has uncovered previously unrecognized microglia functions that may participate in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. We examined microglia-plaque interactions in AD-like mice lacking Trem2 and DAP12 genes as well as in postmortem brains from human AD patients with R47H mutations. This enabled us to demonstrate that the tight envelopment of fibrils and early-stage plaques by microglia processes (“microglia barrier”) may"

However, it remains unknown which parts of these brain regions and their circuits hold social memory. Here, we show that ventral hippocampal CA1 (vCA1) neurons of a mouse and their projections to nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell play a necessary and sufficient role in social memory. Both the proportion of activated vCA1 cells and the strength and stability of the responding cells are greater in response to a familiar mouse than to a previously unencountered mouse. Optogenetic reactivation of vCA1 neurons that respond to the familiar mouse enabled memory retrieval and the association of these neurons with unconditioned stimuli.

The arms extend to the disk outer regions and can be traced down to the midplane. These millimeter-wave observations also reveal an emission gap closer to the star than the spiral arms. We argue that the observed spirals trace shocks of spiral density waves in the midplane of this young disk."

In graphene, the linear dispersion and zero-gap band structure admit highly transparent p-n junctions by simple electrostatic gating. Here, we employ transverse magnetic focusing to probe the propagation of carriers across an electrostatically defined graphene junction. We find agreement with the predicted Snell's law for electrons, including the observation of both positive and negative refraction. Resonant transmission across the p-n junction provides a direct measurement of the angle-dependent transmission coefficient. Comparing experimental data with simulations reveals the crucial role played by the effective junction width, providing guidance for future device design. Our results pave the way for realizing electron optics based on graphene p-n junctions."

We developed a CRISPR screen using ~18,000 single guide RNAs targeting >700 kilobases surrounding the genes NF1, NF2, and CUL3, which are involved in BRAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma. We find that noncoding locations that modulate drug resistance also harbor predictive hallmarks of noncoding function. With a subset of regions at the CUL3 locus, we demonstrate that engineered mutations alter transcription factor occupancy and long-range and local epigenetic environments, implicating these sites in gene regulation and chemotherapeutic resistance. Through our expansion of the potential of pooled CRISPR screens, we provide tools for genomic discovery and for elucidating biologically relevant mechanisms of gene regulation."

For intraspecific genetic diversity, however, we lack even basic knowledge on its global distribution. We georeferenced 92,801 mitochondrial sequences for >4500 species of terrestrial mammals and amphibians, and found that genetic diversity is 27% higher in the tropics than in nontropical regions. Overall, habitats that are more affected by humans hold less genetic diversity than wilder regions, although results for mammals are sensitive to choice of genetic locus. Our study associates geographic coordinates with publicly available genetic sequences at a massive scale, yielding an opportunity to investigate both the drivers of this component of biodiversity and the genetic consequences of the anthropogenic modification of nature."
https://openalex.org/W2529358232,"Adolescents are notorious for engaging in reward-seeking behaviors, a tendency attributed to heightened activity in the brain's reward systems during adolescence. It has been suggested that reward sensitivity in adolescence might be adaptive, but evidence of an adaptive role has been scarce. Using a probabilistic reinforcement learning task combined with reinforcement learning models and fMRI, we found that adolescents showed better reinforcement learning and a stronger link between reinforcement learning and episodic memory for rewarding outcomes. This behavioral benefit was related to heightened prediction error-related BOLD activity in the hippocampus and to stronger functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the striatum at the time of reinforcement. These findings reveal an important role for the hippocampus in reinforcement learning in adolescence and suggest that reward sensitivity in adolescence is related to adaptive differences in how adolescents learn from experience."
https://openalex.org/W2526128409,"Animals adapt their growth rate and body size to available nutrients by a general modulation of insulin–insulin-like growth factor signaling. In Drosophila , dietary amino acids promote the release in the hemolymph of brain insulin-like peptides (Dilps), which in turn activate systemic organ growth. Dilp secretion by insulin-producing cells involves a relay through unknown cytokines produced by fat cells. Here, we identify Methuselah (Mth) as a secretin-incretin receptor subfamily member required in the insulin-producing cells for proper nutrient coupling. We further show, using genetic and ex vivo organ culture experiments, that the Mth ligand Stunted (Sun) is a circulating insulinotropic peptide produced by fat cells. Therefore, Sun and Mth define a new cross-organ circuitry that modulates physiological insulin levels in response to nutrients."

Manufacturing lateral superlattices remains a much bigger challenge, with new opportunities offered by the use of moire patterns in van der Waals heterostructures of graphene and hexagonal crystals such as boron nitride (h-BN). Experiments to date have elucidated the novel electronic structure of highly aligned graphene/h-BN heterostructures, where miniband edges and saddle points in the electronic dispersion can be reached by electrostatic gating. Here we investigate the dynamics of electrons in moire minibands by transverse electron focusing, a measurement of ballistic transport between adjacent local contacts in a magnetic field. At low temperatures, we observe caustics of skipping orbits extending over hundreds of superlattice periods, reversals of the cyclotron revolution for successive minibands, and breakdown of cyclotron motion near van Hove singularities. At high temperatures, we study the suppression of electron focusing by inelastic scattering."

We demonstrate that bumblebees exhibit dopamine-dependent positive emotion–like states across behavioral contexts. After training with one rewarding and one unrewarding cue, bees that received pretest sucrose responded in a positive manner toward ambiguous cues. In a second experiment, pretest consumption of sucrose solution resulted in a shorter time to reinitiate foraging after a simulated predator attack. These behavioral changes were abolished with topical application of the dopamine antagonist fluphenazine. Further experiments established that pretest sucrose does not simply cause bees to become more exploratory. Our findings present a new opportunity for understanding the fundamental neural elements of emotions and may alter the view of how emotion states affect decision-making in animals."
https://openalex.org/W2528993515,"The striatum, the entry nucleus of the basal ganglia, lacks laminar or columnar organization of its principal cells; nevertheless, functional data suggest that it is spatially organized. Here we examine whether the connectivity and synaptic organization of striatal GABAergic interneurons contributes to such spatial organization. Focusing on the two main classes of striatal GABAergic interneurons (fast-spiking interneurons [FSIs] and low-threshold-spiking interneurons [LTSIs]), we apply a combination of optogenetics and viral tracing approaches to dissect striatal microcircuits in mice. Our results reveal fundamental differences between the synaptic organizations of both interneuron types. FSIs target exclusively striatal projection neurons (SPNs) within close proximity and form strong synapses on the proximal somatodendritic region. In contrast, LTSIs target both SPNs and cholinergic interneurons, and synaptic connections onto SPNs are made exclusively over long distances and onto distal dendrites. These results suggest fundamentally different functions of FSIs and LTSIs in shaping striatal output."

We generated stable transgenic mouse lines that express CreERT2 and GFP from ten different enhancer elements with activity in distinct domains within the embryonic basal ganglia. We used these unique tools to generate a comprehensive regional fate map of the mouse subpallium, including sources for specific subtypes of amygdala neurons. We then focused on deciphering transcriptional mechanisms that control enhancer activity. Using machine-learning computations, in vivo chromosomal occupancy of 13 transcription factors that regulate subpallial patterning and differentiation and analysis of enhancer activity in Dlx1/2 and Lhx6 mutants, we elucidated novel molecular mechanisms that regulate region-specific enhancer activity in the developing brain. Thus, these subpallial enhancer transgenic lines are data and tool resources to study transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W2523929848,"Cyclin A2 activates the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk1 and Cdk2 and is expressed at elevated levels from S phase until early mitosis. We found that mutant mice that cannot elevate cyclin A2 are chromosomally unstable and tumor-prone. Underlying the chromosomal instability is a failure to up-regulate the meiotic recombination 11 (Mre11) nuclease in S phase, which leads to impaired resolution of stalled replication forks, insufficient repair of double-stranded DNA breaks, and improper segregation of sister chromosomes. Unexpectedly, cyclin A2 controlled Mre11 abundance through a C-terminal RNA binding domain that selectively and directly binds Mre11 transcripts to mediate polysome loading and translation. These data reveal cyclin A2 as a mechanistically diverse regulator of DNA replication combining multifaceted kinase-dependent functions with a kinase-independent, RNA binding-dependent role that ensures adequate repair of common replication errors."
https://openalex.org/W2528662291,"Summary Animals estimate visual motion by integrating light intensity information over time and space. The integration requires nonlinear processing, which makes motion estimation circuitry sensitive to specific spatiotemporal correlations that signify visual motion. Classical models of motion estimation weight these correlations to produce direction-selective signals. However, the correlational algorithms they describe have not been directly measured in elementary motion-detecting neurons (EMDs). Here, we employed stimuli to directly measure responses to pairwise correlations in Drosophila 's EMD neurons, T4 and T5. Activity in these neurons was required for behavioral responses to pairwise correlations and was predictive of those responses. The pattern of neural responses in the EMDs was inconsistent with one classical model of motion detection, and the timescale and selectivity of correlation responses constrained the temporal filtering properties in potential models. These results reveal how neural responses to pairwise correlations drive visual behavior in this canonical motion-detecting circuit."

We performed a whole body muscle MRI using T1w and 3-point Dixon imaging centered on thighs and lower trunk region.T1w whole body muscle MRI showed a homogeneous pattern of muscle involvement that could also be found in pre-symptomatic individuals. We found a strong correlation between muscle strength, muscle functional scales and the degree of muscle fatty replacement in muscle MRI analyzed using T1w and 3-point Dixon imaging studies. Moreover, muscle MRI detected mild degree of fatty replacement in paraspinal muscles in pre-symptomatic patients.Based on our findings, we consider that muscle MRI correlates with muscle function in patients with AOPD and could be useful for diagnosis and follow-up in pre-symptomatic and symptomatic patients under treatment.Muscle MRI correlates with muscle function in patients with AOPD and could be useful to follow-up patients in daily clinic."

The high sensitivity of MT fields to the presence of electrically conductive fluids makes it a promising proxy for determining mechanical strength variations throughout the lithosphere. We demonstrate how a viscosity structure, approximated from electrical resistivity, results in a geodynamic model that successfully predicts short-wavelength surface topography, lithospheric deformation, and mantle upwelling beneath recent volcanism. We further show that this viscosity is physically consistent with and better constrained than that derived from laboratory-based rheology. We conclude that MT imaging provides a practical observational constraint for quantifying the dynamic evolution of the continental lithosphere."

Two previous studies suggest that clonally related interneurons originating from individual MGE/PoA progenitors frequently form local clusters in the cortex. However, Mayer et al. and Harwell et al. recently argued that MGE/PoA-derived interneuron clones disperse widely and populate different forebrain structures. Here, we report further analysis of the spatial distribution of clonally related interneurons and demonstrate that interneuron clones do not non-specifically disperse in the forebrain. Around 70% of clones are restricted to one brain structure, predominantly the cortex. Moreover, the regional distribution of clonally related interneurons exhibits a clear clustering feature, which cannot occur by chance from a random diffusion.

Despite the fungus's agronomic and economic importance, very little is known about fundamental aspects of P. xanthii biology, such as obligate biotrophy or pathogenesis. To design more durable control strategies, genomic information about P. xanthii is needed. Powdery mildews are fungal pathogens with large genomes compared with those of other fungi, which contain vast amounts of repetitive DNA sequences, much of which is composed of retrotransposons. To reduce genome complexity, in this work we aimed to obtain and analyse the epiphytic transcriptome of P. xanthii as a starting point for genomic research. Total RNA was isolated from epiphytic fungal material, and the corresponding cDNA library was sequenced using a 454 GS FLX platform. Over 676,562 reads were obtained and assembled into 37,241 contigs. Annotation data identified 8,798 putative genes with different orthologues. As described for other powdery mildew fungi, a similar set of missing core ascomycete genes was found, which may explain obligate biotrophy. To gain insight into the plant-pathogen relationships, special attention was focused on the analysis of the secretome. After this analysis, 137 putative secreted proteins were identified, including 53 candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Consistent with a putative role in pathogenesis, the expression profile observed for some of these CSEPs showed expression maxima at the beginning of the infection process at 24 h after inoculation, when the primary appressoria are mostly formed. Our data mark the onset of genomics research into this very important pathogen of cucurbits and shed some light on the intimate relationship between this pathogen and its host plant."

The mammalian cortex is subdivided into areas devoted to vision, sensation, audition, and other functions. Each area can further be divided physiologically into smaller units or functional columns. Excitatory and inhibitory neurons, the two main cell types of the cortex and hippocampus, have distinct embryonic origins (Anderson et al., 1997Anderson S.A. Eisenstat D.D. Shi L. Rubenstein J.L.

Excitatory cells are derived from the dorsal telencephalon or pallium. Consecutive rounds of asymmetric cell division produce lineage-related sister excitatory neurons that migrate short distances toward the pia into the overlaying developing cortical plate. After migration, this results in spatially organized vertical clusters of excitatory sibling neurons (referred to as clonal units) that form functional columnar microcircuits in the neocortex (Li et al., 2012Li Y.

By contrast, inhibitory cells are entirely derived from the ventral telencephalon or subpallium (reviewed in Marín and Rubenstein, 2001Marín O. Rubenstein J.L.R.

Despite the technical difficulties associated with fate mapping interneuronal lineages due to their complex migration patterns, four recent studies (Brown et al., 2011Brown K.N. Chen S. Han Z.

If clonally related interneurons were confined to discrete anatomical brain units (i.e., columns of the cortex), this would support the idea that cell lineage is dictating the integration of interneurons into functional cortical networks. All four groups agreed that before migration, the majority of interneurons are generated from symmetric and asymmetric divisions of MGE progenitor cells, leading to radially aligned interneuron precursors in close proximity to each other (Brown et al., 2011Brown K.N.

Postmitotic interneurons reach their final positions within the cortex through long-range tangential migration that requires them to travel 100 times farther than excitatory pyramidal neurons to reach the cortical plate. The four studies draw different conclusions about how lineage contributes to the final location of interneurons after long-range migration. Brown et al. and Ciceri et al. described clonal clusters in the cortex that were sufficiently compact to suggest that they are confined by functional boundaries. Specifically, Brown et al. suggested that presumptive clones were aligned into horizontal and radial columns, very similar to their excitatory counterparts (Brown et al., 2011Brown K.N. Chen S. Han Z. Lu C.-H. Tan X. Zhang X.-J. Ding L. Lopez-Cruz A. Saur D.

Anderson S.A. et al.Clonal production and organization of inhibitory interneurons in the neocortex.Science. 2011; 334: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Ciceri et al. primarily described laminar clusters. In contrast, Mayer et al. and Harwell et al. both concluded that clonally related interneurons can disperse across anatomical and functional boundaries within the forebrain and are not restricted to narrow cortical columns or lamina (Figure 1B). Mayer et al. and Harwell et al. agree that sibling interneurons reside in a volume that far exceeds functional cortical units, such as the whisker barrels (Bruno et al., 2003Bruno R.M. Khatri V. Land P.W. Simons D.J. Thalamocortical angular tuning domains within individual barrels of rat somatosensory cortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9565-9574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the somatosensory cortex (the average distance [AD] between pairs of sibling neurons was more than 2 mm in Mayer et al., 2015Mayer C. Jaglin X.H. Cobbs L.V. Bandler R.C. Streicher C. Cepko C.L. Hippenmeyer S. Fishell G. Clonally related forebrain interneurons disperse broadly across both functional areas and structural boundaries.Neuron. 2015; 87: 989-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar; Figure 1B). This indicates that integration of interneurons into functional units is unlikely to be determined by lineage. A common feature of all studies considered above was that interneuron progenitors in the MGE of mouse embryos were labeled with retroviruses encoding fluorescent proteins. What then explains the disparate results reported in these four investigations? Discrepancies almost certainly arose from the different methods used to assess and define interneuron clonality. Mayer et al. and Harwell et al. used a replication-defective retroviral library containing a highly diverse set of DNA barcodes, an approach pioneered by Walsh and Cepko in the early 1990s (Walsh and Cepko, 1993Walsh C. Cepko C.L. Clonal dispersion in proliferative layers of developing cerebral cortex.Nature. 1993; 362: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), to determine lineal relationships between labeled interneurons. Recovering the barcodes from the mature progeny of infected progenitor cells enabled Mayer et al. and Harwell et al. to unambiguously determine the lineal relationship between clones regardless of their geometric distribution within the brain. In contrast, Brown et al. and Ciceri et al. used a combination of approaches, including (1) time-lapse imaging (before migration), (2) mixing of red and green retroviruses, and (3) presumptive clonal labeling with low-titer retrovirus injections, followed by the use of geometrical criteria to infer lineal relationships among retrovirally labeled neurons. For the following reasons, we believe that none of the aforementioned methods used by Brown et al. and Ciceri et al. reliably indicated lineal relationships among interneurons. First, while in principle time-lapse imaging could be used to determine lineal relationships, given both the distances involved and the protracted time over which interneurons migrate from their birth to their settling position, this approach is impractical. Second, the use of red and green retroviruses is confounded by technical difficulties that, when addressed by the Ciceri et al. study, revealed that assigned clusters of interneurons are polyclonal in nature. In brief, the authors report that when retroviruses encoding GFP and mCherry were mixed before ultracentrifugation, “most clusters were likely to include cells from a different progenitor (i.e., a different fluorescent protein), even at very limiting dilutions.” The authors conclude, “This strongly suggested that lineage relationships are not exclusive determinants of interneuron clustering.” Third, while low-titer retroviral injections, followed by the use of geometrical criteria, can in principle be used to determine lineal relationships, in practice this proves untenable. Both Brown et al. and Ciceri et al. compared the distance from each labeled interneuron to its closest neighbor (nearest-neighbor distance, or NND) to a randomly computer-simulated dataset to test whether the labeled interneurons were clustered. Ciceri et al. then calculated the number of clusters in the experiment using a threshold distance value that maximized the difference between the number of clusters observed in the experimental dataset and the mean number of clusters in 100 simulated populations of randomly distributed neurons. Brown et al. used spatial parameters that picked up excitatory neuron clusters to predict clonally related inhibitory interneuron clusters. In principle, if a single progenitor could be reliably labeled with a single injection, it would indeed be possible to trace sibling interneurons in the forebrain, even if individual siblings pursued drastically different migration paths. However, the labeling of a single progenitor cell cannot be guaranteed with current technology. Brown et al. attempted to use low-titer retroviral injections “to label dividing progenitor cells in the ventricular zone…at clonal density.” Given this claim, we were surprised when we looked at the raw data provided by Brown et al. (Figures 2A and 2B ) to see that individual brains contained up to 538 labeled cells, which far exceeds what our analysis indicates would allow for “clonal labeling.” When local clusters are deemed to be clonal, lumping errors (clustered cells that are not clonal) and splitting errors (dispersed cells that are clonal but are not recognized as such) are a major confounding factor, particularly for datasets with a large number of total neurons (such as used in Brown et al.; Figures 2A and 2B). This is because as the number of labeled neurons increases in a dataset, the chance that a non-clonally related cell will be found nearby clonally related cells increases. Sultan et al. recognize this point; as the authors state, “a clone forming a local cluster does not preclude the presence of nearby non-clonally related interneurons….The more data points, the shorter the distance in general between them. Therefore, it is crucial to take into consideration the total number of data points in each dataset.” Even with lower rates of infections per brain (Figures 2C and 2D), Mayer et al. and Harwell et al. reported a large number of interneurons that were nearest neighbors, but were not clonally related (i.e., they had different DNA barcodes, indicating that they originated from different progenitors; see dendrogram analysis in Figures 3D and 3E in Mayer et al., 2015Mayer C. Jaglin X.H. Cobbs L.V. Bandler R.C. Streicher C. Cepko C.L. Hippenmeyer S. Fishell G. Clonally related forebrain interneurons disperse broadly across both functional areas and structural boundaries.Neuron. 2015; 87: 989-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Sultan et al. justify the high number of labeled cells in Brown et al. by stating that “a significant fraction (∼47.2%; 17 out of 36) of the brains in Brown et al. had a comparable labeling density in the cortex to those in Mayer et al.” This logic is flawed. As mentioned above, determining clonality with geometric means relies on low infection rates to avoid lumping and splitting errors (see dendrogram analysis), whereas if DNA barcodes are used, there is no such requirement for sparse labeling. Turrero García et al., 2016Turrero García M. Mazzola E. Harwell C.C. Lineage relationships do not drive MGE/PoA-derived interneuron clustering in the brain.Neuron. 2016; 92 (this issue): 52-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, in this same issue, provide an additional detailed analysis, showing that the spatial parameters used in Brown et al. to cluster interneurons fail to identify lineal boundaries in either our dataset or that of Harwell et al. Furthermore, because these methods require that any “clonal” group of cells be constrained to a specified geometric area, as a matter of principle these methods cannot be used to study dispersed clones that reside in different forebrain structures or distant locations within the neocortex. By further analyzing the dataset published by Mayer et al., 2015Mayer C. Jaglin X.H. Cobbs L.V. Bandler R.C. Streicher C. Cepko C.L. Hippenmeyer S. Fishell G. Clonally related forebrain interneurons disperse broadly across both functional areas and structural boundaries.Neuron. 2015; 87: 989-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, Sultan et al. conclude that clonally related interneurons are “not randomly” (or “not non-specifically”) dispersed. We agree with this conclusion. However, given the biological constraints placed on interneurons during their development, it should come as no surprise that interneurons (clonally related or not) are not randomly distributed. For example, it is known that interneurons’ ultimate location in the brain is heavily influenced by (1) their position and time of birth (Miyoshi et al., 2007Miyoshi G. Butt S.J.B. Takebayashi H. Fishell G. Physiologically distinct temporal cohorts of cortical interneurons arise from telencephalic Olig2-expressing precursors.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7786-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), (2) prescribed paths of migration (Marín, 2013Marín O. Cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling the migration of neocortical interneurons.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2013; 38: 2019-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, Tanaka et al., 2006Tanaka D.H. Maekawa K. Yanagawa Y. Obata K. Murakami F. Multidirectional and multizonal tangential migration of GABAergic interneurons in the developing cerebral cortex.Development. 2006; 133: 2167-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and (3) stereotyped radial migration from the marginal and subventricular zone to the cortical plate (Miyoshi and Fishell, 2011Miyoshi G. Fishell G. GABAergic interneuron lineages selectively sort into specific cortical layers during early postnatal development.Cereb. Cortex. 2011; 21: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). All of these factors indicate that while perhaps the dispersion of interneurons is stochastic, it is also tightly regulated, and therefore a random dispersion model will be grossly inaccurate. Recognizing this, we deliberately avoided making statements about random dispersion in our original study (Mayer et al., 2015Mayer C. Jaglin X.H. Cobbs L.V. Bandler R.C. Streicher C. Cepko C.L. Hippenmeyer S. Fishell G. Clonally related forebrain interneurons disperse broadly across both functional areas and structural boundaries.Neuron. 2015; 87: 989-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although clonally related cells disperse several millimeters within the cortex, one might ask whether sibling interneurons reside closer to each other than unrelated interneurons. As mentioned above, we argue that this question cannot be addressed by comparing the allocation of sibling interneurons to a computer-simulated random distribution. This is because all interneurons might form clusters independent of their clonal relationship when compared to a random distribution. Therefore, in Mayer et al. we instead compared clonal dispersion (i.e., “intra-clonal distance”) to non-clonal interneuron dispersion (i.e., “inter-clonal distance”). Inter-clonal distance is a biologically relevant control for clonal dispersion because all cells used in the analysis were labeled with the same retroviral approach and therefore have similar birthdates and paths of migration into the cortex. Similar to the analysis done in Mayer et al., but for cortical interneurons only, we examined whether the AD between pairs of clonally related interneurons was preferentially reduced compared to unrelated interneurons. The “intra-clonal distance” was calculated as the AD between all possible pairs of clonally related interneurons (Figure 3Bi ). The “inter-clonal distance” was calculated as the AD between all possible pairs of unrelated interneurons (Figures 3Bii–3Biv), which includes the distance between (1) “multi-cell clones” (Figure 3Bii), (2) “single-cell clones” (Figure 3Biii), and (3) multi-cell clones and single-cell clones (Figure 3Biv). The AD between 40 pairs of clonally related interneurons in the cortex of postnatal day 16 (P16) mice (AD = 2,134 ± 213, SEM, n = 40) was not statistically different from 926 pairs of clonally unrelated interneurons (AD = 2,145 ± 34, SEM, n = 926; p > 0.9, Kruskal-Wallis test, multiple comparison; p = 0.6, Mann-Whitney nonparametric t test; Figure 3C). Sultan et al. claim that “it appears inappropriate to combine them [single-cell clones] together with the bona fide clones [multi-cell clones] for the distance and clustering analysis.” We conducted a separate analysis excluding single-cell clones and still did not find statistical differences between clonally related interneurons and clonally unrelated interneurons (Figure 3C). When we broke down the analysis by dataset (i.e., each retrovirally infected brain), we did not detect a statistical difference despite the low numbers of clonally related pairs in each analysis (Figure 3D; p > 0.1 in all three datasets, Mann-Whitney nonparametric t test). Taken together, our results indicate that the majority of clonally related interneurons are not located closer to each other than a biologically similar group of unrelated interneurons. Sultan et al. also compared intra- and inter-clonal distances, but the authors came to different conclusions. Their analysis was performed as following: “For ‘intra-clonal’ and ‘inter-clonal’ distance analysis, all single barcoded cells in individual datasets were considered as a ‘clone.’ ‘Intra-clonal’ distances were computed between all single barcoded interneurons and ‘inter-clonal’ distances were computed between the single barcoded interneuron ‘clone’ and other true interneuron clones in the same dataset.” Single barcoded cells by definition are not clonal, so we do not know why Sultan et al. computed the intra-clonal distance using single barcoded cells. Any further analysis (e.g., computing “inter-clonal distance”) using this intra-clonal distance will not be accurate. Re-analyzing the data published in Mayer et al., 2015Mayer C. Jaglin X.H. Cobbs L.V. Bandler R.C. Streicher C. Cepko C.L. Hippenmeyer S. Fishell G. Clonally related forebrain interneurons disperse broadly across both functional areas and structural boundaries.Neuron. 2015; 87: 989-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, Sultan et al. highlight the following conclusions: “around 60% of local interneuron clusters are clonally related siblings” and “at least ∼50% of interneuron clones form local clusters.” This is consistent with our original article. We reported that 52% of the clones formed “local clusters” and agree that ∼60% of “local interneuron clusters” are clonally related siblings. However, one needs to appreciate that cells being scored as “clustered” versus “not-clustered” in the underlying type of analysis (NND, dendrogram analysis) depends on the total number of data points (Figure 3A). For example, in a dataset containing only one clone consisting of two sibling cells, 100% of “local interneuron clusters” are clonal. Hence, limiting the number of virally infected cells will always result in more clonal cells being nearest neighbors, and vice versa (Figure 3A; Figure S4 in Mayer et al., 2015Mayer C. Jaglin X.H. Cobbs L.V. Bandler R.C. Streicher C. Cepko C.L. Hippenmeyer S. Fishell G. Clonally related forebrain interneurons disperse broadly across both functional areas and structural boundaries.Neuron. 2015; 87: 989-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, the percentage of “local interneuron clusters” or the percentage of clones that form “local clusters” in the dendrogram analysis has no biological significance. It is simply an epiphenomenon of how many cells were labeled by viral injection. In Mayer et al., we in fact included this analysis as a cautionary note. We performed the dendrogram analysis to illustrate that lumping errors (clustered cells that are not clonal) and splitting errors (dispersed cells that are clonal but are not recognized as such) are inevitable if geometrical criteria are used to determine the clonality of retrovirally labeled cells because these criteria implicitly assume that neighboring cells are clonally related (Brown et al., 2011Brown K.N. Chen S. Han Z. Lu C.-H. Tan X. Zhang X.-J. Ding L. Lopez-Cruz A. Saur D. Anderson S.A. et al.Clonal production and organization of inhibitory interneurons in the neocortex.Science. 2011; 334: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Ciceri et al., 2013Ciceri G. Dehorter N. Sols I. Huang Z.J. Maravall M. Marín O. Lineage-specific laminar organization of cortical GABAergic interneurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We would like to address the “error corrections” made by Sultan et al. In particular, Sultan et al. state that we failed to add clone #32 to our dendrogram. Calling this an “error correction” is inaccurate because we deliberately excluded this clone from our analysis. Clone #32 was located within the olfactory bulb, and the dendrogram analysis in Mayer et al. “focused on cortical, hippocampal, and striatal clones only.” In another such “error correction,” Sultan et al. note that clone #12 contained three cells in the cortex and three cells in the hippocampus, requiring them to “add all six clones to the dendrogram.” This implies that we incorrectly excluded these cells from our dendrogram, which again is inaccurate. We deliberately divided clones that crossed anatomical boundaries for analysis within brain structures. Sultan et al. noted that the use of Euclidian distances in structures such as the cortex is problematic because in many, if not most, cases, migration along straight lines (for instance, in cases where such trajectories would cross ventricles or sulci) is not biologically tenable. Nonetheless, all distances between pairs of neurons described in Mayer et al., as well as Sultan et al. and Brown et al., were calculated as Euclidian distances. Given the impossibility of determining more realistic trajectories, this approach is at least systematic and by its nature chronically underestimates the real distances between neurons. This only strengthens our conclusion that clonal dispersion does not respect functional boundaries, as properly corrected measurements of the distance between clones would only be larger rather than smaller. Sultan et al. emphasize that “around 70% of interneuron clones [in the dataset of Mayer et al., 2015Mayer C. Jaglin X.H. Cobbs L.V. Bandler R.C. Streicher C. Cepko C.L. Hippenmeyer S. Fishell G. Clonally related forebrain interneurons disperse broadly across both functional areas and structural boundaries.Neuron. 2015; 87: 989-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar] are restricted in one forebrain structure, predominantly the cortex.” This precisely reproduces the findings that we published in our original article (Mayer et al., 2015Mayer C. Jaglin X.H. Cobbs L.V. Bandler R.C. Streicher C. Cepko C.L. Hippenmeyer S. Fishell G. Clonally related forebrain interneurons disperse broadly across both functional areas and structural boundaries.Neuron. 2015; 87: 989-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We concluded that the remaining 30% of clones spanning more than one brain structure provide clear cases in which sibling neurons are confined neither to one brain structure nor to a functional cortical unit. Clones spanning across brain structures was a novel finding that had not been reported by previous studies. While the results of Mayer et al. and Harwell et al. demonstrate that interneuron clones are not obliged to populate particular anatomical structures, this does not rule out the possibility that they are predetermined to particular brain regions. However, addressing this possibility requires a more nuanced analysis. Both the absolute size of the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum and the density of interneurons within these structures differ dramatically. For example, 20% of the cells within the cortex and hippocampus are interneurons (Fishell and Rudy, 2011Fishell G. Rudy B. Mechanisms of inhibition within the telencephalon: “where the wild things are”.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 34: 535-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), whereas the percentage of interneurons within the striatum is only 3% (Marin et al., 2000Marin O. Anderson S.A. Rubenstein J.L. Origin and molecular specification of striatal interneurons.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6063-6076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Tepper et al., 2010Tepper J.M. Tecuapetla F. Koós T. Ibáñez-Sandoval O. Heterogeneity and diversity of striatal GABAergic interneurons.Front. Neuroanat. 2010; 4: 150Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). These facts demonstrate that even if interneurons were randomly distributed to different structures, probabilistically, they would be preferentially found in the cortex. That said, we again reiterate that we do not believe the distribution of interneurons is random. But what rules then underlie the distribution of discrete interneuron lineages? Our results indicate that if interneuron lineages do have a covert logic as to how they populate different structures, clearly the rules of allocation are not as simple as a lineage being earmarked for cortex or hippocampus per se. Further examination of interneuron lineages will be required to address whether there is a degree of predetermination in the positioning of sibling neurons derived from a common lineage. We show here and in Mayer et al., 2015Mayer C. Jaglin X.H. Cobbs L.V. Bandler R.C. Streicher C. Cepko C.L. Hippenmeyer S. Fishell G. Clonally related forebrain interneurons disperse broadly across both functional areas and structural boundaries.Neuron. 2015; 87: 989-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar that clonally related interneurons are not more closely clustered than non-lineally related interneurons (proximally generated brethren). Of course, this neither should nor does end the debate as to whether lineage contributes to the development, subtype differentiation, or connectivity of interneurons. Our own results are limited by the fact that the lineages we assembled were only partially reconstructed, and we can say nothing regarding the fate of those sibling cells that we failed to recover. Furthermore, we know startling little about the phenotypic identity and nothing about the connectivity of clonally related siblings, both of which would be fascinating to explore. We would, however, implore any further examination of lineage to be confined to methods that provide high confidence of the lineage relationship of cells designated as clones.

Cartesian coordinates of every neuron located in the cortex from which we recovered a barcode were exported from Neurolucida software (MBF Bioscience) to MATLAB software (MathWorks) to calculate Euclidian distances between pairs of neurons. The pairwise distance was only calculated for cells located within the cortex and within one hemisphere. All sibling cells located outside the cortex were excluded from the analysis. The “intra-clonal distance” was calculated as the AD between all possible pairs of clonally related interneurons. The “inter-clonal distance” was calculated as the AD between all possible pairs of unrelated interneurons, which includes the distance between (1) multi-cell clones, (2) single-cell clones, and (3) multi-cell clones and single-cell clones (Figure 3B).

https://openalex.org/W2529277346,"In skeletal regeneration approaches using human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hBM-MSC), functional evaluation before implantation has traditionally used biomarkers identified using fetal bovine serum-based osteogenic induction media and time courses of at least two weeks. However, emerging pre-clinical evidence indicates donor-dependent discrepancies between these ex vivo measurements and the ability to form bone, calling for improved tests. Therefore, we adopted a multiparametric approach aiming to generate an osteogenic potency assay with improved correlation. hBM-MSC populations from six donors, each expanded under clinical-grade (cGMP) conditions, showed heterogeneity for ex vivo growth response, mineralization and bone-forming ability in a murine xenograft assay. A subset of literature-based biomarker genes was reproducibly upregulated to a significant extent across all populations as cells responded to two different osteogenic induction media. These 12 biomarkers were also measurable in a one-week assay, befitting clinical cell expansion time frames and cGMP growth conditions. They were selected for further challenge using a combinatorial approach aimed at determining ex vivo and in vivo consistency. We identified five globally relevant osteogenic signature genes, notably TGF-ß1 pathway interactors; ALPL, COL1A2, DCN, ELN and RUNX2. Used in agglomerative cluster analysis, they correctly grouped the bone-forming cell populations as distinct. Although donor #6 cells were correlation slope outliers, they contrastingly formed bone without showing ex vivo mineralization. Mathematical expression level normalization of the most discrepantly upregulated signature gene COL1A2, sufficed to cluster donor #6 with the bone-forming classification. Moreover, attenuating factors causing genuine COL1A2 gene down-regulation, restored ex vivo mineralization. This suggested that the signature gene had an osteogenically influential role; nonetheless no single biomarker was fully deterministic whereas all five signature genes together led to accurate cluster analysis. We show proof of principle for an osteogenic potency assay providing early characterization of primary cGMP-hBM-MSC cultures according to their donor-specific bone-forming potential."
https://openalex.org/W2528889322,"A defining trait of linguistic competence is the ability to combine elements into increasingly complex structures to denote, and to comprehend, a potentially infinite number of meanings. Recent magnetoencephalography (MEG) work has investigated these processes by comparing the response to nouns in combinatorial (blue car) and non-combinatorial (rnsh car) contexts. In the current study we extended this paradigm using electroencephalography (EEG) to dissociate the role of semantic content from phonological well-formedness (yerl car). We used event-related potential (ERP) recordings in order to better relate the observed neurophysiological correlates of basic combinatorial operations to prior ERP work on comprehension. We found that nouns in combinatorial contexts (blue car) elicited a greater centro-parietal negativity between 180-400ms, independent of the phonological well-formedness of the context word. We discuss the potential relationship between this ‘combinatorial’ effect and classic N400 effects. We also report preliminary evidence for an early anterior negative deflection immediately preceding the critical noun in combinatorial contexts, which we tentatively interpret as an electrophysiological reflex of syntactic structure initialization."

The way that neurons in our brain are assembled into functional circuits remains largely unknown. During embryonic development, the different neuronal subtypes that will form cortical circuits are born from spatially distinct areas. Progenitors that give rise to excitatory neurons divide locally within the prospective neocortex. Most inhibitory neurons, or interneurons, destined for the cortex are born from progenitors located in ventral structures of the embryonic brain known as the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) and preoptic area (PoA) and must then migrate great distances to integrate into developing circuits (Bartolini et al., 2013Bartolini G.

In recent years, there has been tremendous interest in the role that clonal lineage may play in these processes. One of the first examples of this came from the work of the Shi laboratory examining the role of lineage in preferential synapse relationships between lineage-related cells in ontogenic columns of cortical excitatory projection neurons (Yu et al., 2009Yu Y.C.

Shi W. Shi S.H. Clonal origins of neocortical interneurons.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2014; 26: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Since inhibitory interneurons migrate great distances tangentially from their birthplace in order to reach their final position in the cortex, keeping track of clonal lineage relationships among these neurons has been a challenge. Two recent studies attempted to track the organization of lineage-related interneurons by labeling progenitors in the MGE/PoA with either one or two fluorescent protein markers, encoded by retroviruses that were used to infect embryonic brains “at clonal density” (Brown et al., 2011Brown K.N. Chen S. Han Z. Lu C.H. Tan X. Zhang X.J. Ding L. Lopez-Cruz A. Saur D. Anderson S.A. et al.Clonal production and organization of inhibitory interneurons in the neocortex.Science. 2011; 334: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Ciceri et al., 2013Ciceri G.

Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Using the spatial relationships among labeled cells in the cortex to assign clonal relationships (i.e., considering that cells located closely in space were derived from the same MGE/PoA progenitors), Brown et al. concluded that presumptive interneuron clones were vertically and horizontally aligned in a manner reminiscent of excitatory projection neurons. This raised the intriguing possibility that lineage relationships could guide either the formation of connections between clonally related interneurons or their integration into functionally related circuits. Ciceri et al. used an unsupervised, unbiased method to detect potential clusters of fluorescent protein-labeled interneurons. The vast majority of the clusters detected in the mature brain were composed of cells located either within a single neocortical layer (46.85% ± 4.06%) or in two adjacent ones (39.45% ± 2.14%), rather than vertically aligned. When MGE/PoA progenitors were labeled using a combination of two retroviruses encoding different fluorescent proteins, most clusters (66.83% ± 1.4%) contained a mixture of cells expressing both fluorophores. From this, the authors concluded that clonal lineage could not be the sole responsible factor driving interneuron clustering, “Although the mechanisms underlying the clustering of interneurons in the cortex remain unclear, our experiments suggest that this process is not univocally linked to their shared clonal origin” (Ciceri et al., 2013Ciceri G.

Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These findings have important implications for understanding the rules that guide the assembly and function of brain circuits; however, new technical approaches were necessary to investigate the lineage relationships among cortical interneurons. Our group, concurrently with the Fishell laboratory, recently addressed this issue (Harwell et al., 2015Harwell C.C. Fuentealba L.C. Gonzalez-Cerrillo A. Parker P.R. Gertz C.C. Mazzola E. Garcia M.T.

This tool allowed us to track unambiguous clonal relationships between MGE-derived interneurons in the mature cortex. Both studies found that neurons belonging to the same clonal lineage were widely dispersed throughout the cortex and other forebrain structures. The conclusions of previous studies were based on the a priori assumption that the non-random (i.e., clustered) distribution of virally labeled cortical interneurons was due to the clonal relationships between them (Brown et al., 2011Brown K.N. Chen S. Han Z. Lu C.H. Tan X. Zhang X.J. Ding L. Lopez-Cruz A. Saur D. Anderson S.A. et al.Clonal production and organization of inhibitory interneurons in the neocortex.Science. 2011; 334: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This was impossible to assess without appropriate tools to definitively determine cell lineages. Indeed, when such tools were applied, unequivocal interneuron clones were not clustered, but rather widely dispersed, both within and across different brain structures (Harwell et al., 2015Harwell C.C. Fuentealba L.C. Gonzalez-Cerrillo A. Parker P.R. Gertz C.C. Mazzola E. Garcia M.T. Alvarez-Buylla A. Cepko C.L. Kriegstein A.R.

They suggest that those studies could be interpreted as support for a model such as the one proposed by Brown et al., whereby cortical interneurons would be functionally organized into spatially isolated local clusters according to their lineage. The authors attempt to find clustered sister cells within the datasets provided by the Fishell laboratory and our own and are only able to do so at distances that are far too large for any functional connections to be established between clonally related interneurons. We believe that the Sultan et al., 2016Sultan K.T. Han Z. Zhang X.-J. Xianyu A. Li Z. Huang K. Shi S.-H.

We believe that throughout the accompanying report from the Shi laboratory, there are a series of terms that are not clearly and unequivocally defined, which might lead to ambiguous interpretations and confusion. For the sake of clarity, we would like to point them out below, along with our considerations about their use.(1)Random/wide/non-specific distribution of interneurons. Sultan et al., 2016Sultan K.T.

Clonally related gabaergic interneurons do not randomly disperse but frequently form local clusters in the forebrain.Neuron. 2016; 92 (this issue): 31-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar use these terms indistinctly, despite their different meanings; neither our previous report (Harwell et al., 2015Harwell C.C.

Jaglin X.H. Cobbs L.V. Bandler R.C. Streicher C. Cepko C.L. Hippenmeyer S. Fishell G. Clonally related forebrain interneurons disperse broadly across both functional areas and structural boundaries.Neuron. 2015; 87: 989-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) claim that MGE/PoA-derived interneurons are randomly allocated to different brain structures, but rather claim that they are widely distributed across them, meaning that clonally related interneurons can be found in anatomically and functionally distinct areas. Likewise, the term non-specific was never used to describe interneuron dispersion in any of the reports discussed here, and we believe it to be too imprecise to be used in this context.(2)Clonal density/clonal labeling/clonally related/clonal clusters. Infection of MGE/PoA progenitors with low-titer viruses encoding fluorescent reporters allows the study of ontogenetic radial units during embryonic development (Brown et al., 2011Brown K.N. Chen S. Han Z. Lu C.H. Tan X. Zhang X.J. Ding L. Lopez-Cruz A. Saur D.

However, this labeling at clonal density is not equivalent to clonal labeling, since it is impossible to unequivocally identify interneurons generated from the same ontogenetic radial unit (i.e., clonally related) after their migration into the neocortex, based solely on their expression of a reporter protein. It is thus incorrect to make the conceptual leap from observing GFP-positive interneurons in spatial proximity to assuming that they are clonal clusters. Despite the fact that the technical advantages and caveats of using a DNA-barcoded retroviral library were already discussed in our original report, as well as in that from the Fishell laboratory (Harwell et al., 2015Harwell C.C.

The first such concern is the role that viral genome silencing could play in the analysis of barcode-labeled clones, since it might lead to an underestimation of the total size of the clones. This is a valid point, which is by no means exclusive to M-MLV barcode libraries but common to all retroviruses, including those used in Brown et al., 2011Brown K.N. Chen S. Han Z. Lu C.H. Tan X.

Barcode recovery from GFP-negative tissue confirmed that clonally related cells, irrespective of silencing, were widely dispersed throughout the brain (Mayer et al., 2015Mayer C. Jaglin X.H.

With regards to the potential overrepresentation of certain barcodes in the retroviral library we used, we would like to point out that the only barcode that was detected more than once across the infected brains in our original study, which could thus have been deemed as overrepresented in the library, was excluded from our analyses (note the absence of “Clone 6” in Figure 4D of Harwell et al., 2015Harwell C.C.

Using the spatial information of any virally labeled cells, irrespective of their barcode or clonal lineage, provides valuable information for performing spatial analyses, as is clear from the work of other groups (Brown et al., 2011Brown K.N. Chen S. Han Z. Lu C.H. Tan X. Zhang X.J. Ding L. Lopez-Cruz A. Saur D.

We do not believe this to be the case and stand by our use of virally labeled cells, with or without barcode recovery, as the best proxy to analyze MGE/PoA-derived interneuron distribution within and across different forebrain areas in the context of the experimental datasets discussed here. As Sultan et al., 2016Sultan K.T. Han Z. Zhang X.-J. Xianyu A. Li Z. Huang K. Shi S.-H.

The present study assessed patients’ characteristics and prevalence of drug resistant TB in sputa smear positive TB patients presenting to Coast Provincial General Hospital (CPGH) in Mombasa, Kenya. Methods Drug resistance was evaluated in 258 randomly selected sputa smear TB positive cases between the periods of November 2011 to February 2012 at the CPGH-Mombasa. Basic demographic data was obtained using administered questionnaires, and clinical history extracted from the files. For laboratory analyses, 2mls of sputum was obtained, decontaminated and subjected to mycobacteria DNA analyses. Detection of first line drug resistance genes was done using MDRTDR plus kit. This was followed with random selection of 83 cases for second line drug resistance genes testing using Genotype MDRTBsl probe assay kit (HAINS Lifesciences, GmbH, Germany), in which ethambutol mutation probes were included. The data was then analyzed using SPSS statistical package version 19.0. Results Male to female ratio was 1:2. Age range was 9 to 75 years, with median of 30 years. New treatment cases constituted 253(98%), among which seven turned out to be PTB negative, and further grouped as 4 (1.6%) PTB negative and 3(1.1%) NTM. 237(91.7%) new cases were fully susceptible to INH and RIF. The remaining, 8 (3.1%) and 1(0.4%) had mono- resistance to INH and RIF, respectively. All the retreatment cases were fully susceptible to the first line drugs. HIV positivity was found in 48 (18.6%) cases, of which 46(17.8%) were co-infected with TB. Of these, 44 (17.1%) showed full susceptibility to TB drugs, while 2 (0.8%) were INH resistant. For the second line drugs, one case each showed mono resistance to both and FQ. Also, one case each showed drug cross poly resistance to both ETH and FQ, with second line injectable antibiotics. However, no significant statistical correlation was established between TB and resistance to the second line drugs p = 0.855. Conclusion The findings of this study showed the existence of resistance to both first and second line anti-tubercular drugs, but no MDR-TB and XDR-TB was detected among patients attending TB clinic at CPGH using molecular techniques."

Adolescence is a time of tumultuous behavior that may result, in part, from brain circuitry that enhances reward seeking. In this issue of Neuron, Davidow et al., 2016Davidow J.Y. Foerde K. Galván A. Shohamy D. Neuron. 2016; 92 (this issue): 93-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar present a convincing argument that adolescent brain functionality can be adaptive in certain contexts, particularly probabilistic learning environments. Adolescence is typically a time when children branch out, take risks, and seek reward. Reward-seeking behavior can refer to those activities that typically result in positive outcomes, such as trying a new sport or making new friends, or those that have the potential to put the adolescent in danger, such as illegal drug use (Spear, 2000Spear L.P. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2000; 24: 417-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). Many have suggested that reward-seeking behavior in adolescence can lead to troublesome outcomes and establish unhealthy habits (e.g., Steinberg, 2008Steinberg L. Dev. Rev. 2008; 28: 78-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar), while others have suggested that these behaviors can be adaptive (e.g., Casey et al., 2010Casey B.J. Duhoux S. Malter Cohen M. Neuron. 2010; 67: 749-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar); empirical evidence for these two possibilities remains mixed. In the past few decades, new developments in technology such as fMRI have allowed scientists to examine what is happening in the brain when an adolescent makes a risky decision in a laboratory setting, such as during reinforcement learning. Probabilistic learning refers to learning about associations that are true most, but not all, of the time. Learning about the associations occurs through trial and error, based on feedback on the learner’s choices. This learning tends to be slow and often occurs outside of conscious awareness. For example, a classic laboratory task that involves probabilistic learning is the weather prediction task (Knowlton et al., 1994Knowlton B.J. Squire L.R. Gluck M.A. Learn. Mem. 1994; 1: 106-120PubMed Google Scholar). In this task, participants are asked to look at playing cards with various symbols and learn to predict which combinations produce rain, and which produce sunshine. Some combinations of cards result in rain most of the time (say, 80%), while other combinations of cards result in sunshine most of the time. However, on 20% of trials where sunshine is normally produced, the outcome is rain. The participant must predict the most likely outcome, which sometimes means discounting occasional feedback that is incongruent with the majority of trials. In the same respect, in real life, just because the sky appeared sunny one day but produced rain does not mean you should carry an umbrella the next time you see clear skies. During probabilistic learning and other feedback-based learning tasks, feedback results in a predictable signal change in a region within the brain’s reward circuitry, known as the striatum (Delgado et al., 2005Delgado M.R. Miller M.M. Inati S. Phelps E.A. Neuroimage. 2005; 24: 862-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, Seymour et al., 2007Seymour B. Daw N. Dayan P. Singer T. Dolan R. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Feedback about correct and incorrect performance results in similar brain signals as those produced by extrinsic reward and punishments, such as monetary gain and loss, allowing behavior to be shaped to maximize future reward (Tricomi et al., 2006Tricomi E. Delgado M.R. McCandliss B.D. McClelland J.L. Fiez J.A. J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2006; 18: 1029-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These signals occur in response to a prediction error, which represents the difference between the actual outcome and the expected outcome. For example, when an actual outcome is more negative than the expected outcome, such as when a student expects an A grade but receives a C, this is termed a negative prediction error. A positive prediction error occurs when the opposite happens: the actual outcome is greater than expected, such as when a student expecting a C receives an A. Prediction error signaling in the ventral striatum and the hippocampus, an area vital to learning and memory, has been shown to aid in learning and memory (Sadeh et al., 2011Sadeh T. Shohamy D. Levy D.R. Reggev N. Maril A. J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2011; 23: 1597-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), helping individuals learn from their previous successes and mistakes. Most studies investigating reinforcement learning have focused on adult populations, but increasingly, research has suggested that differences in learning processes between adolescents and adults may help to explain why adolescents are more prone to engage in risk-seeking behavior than adults (Cohen et al., 2010Cohen J.R. Asarnow R.F. Sabb F.W. Bilder R.M. Bookheimer S.Y. Knowlton B.J. Poldrack R.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, Galvan et al., 2006Galvan A. Hare T.A. Parra C.E. Penn J. Voss H. Glover G. Casey B.J. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6885-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Adolescents show significant brain differences compared to adults, both in terms of size of structures and in functionality (Steinberg, 2008Steinberg L. Dev. Rev. 2008; 28: 78-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar, Luna et al., 2010Luna B. Padmanabhan A. O’Hearn K. Brain Cogn. 2010; 72: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Many believe that delayed development of the prefrontal cortex, an area crucial to control and planning, results in differential use of major brain structures during adolescence as compared to adulthood (Steinberg, 2008Steinberg L. Dev. Rev. 2008; 28: 78-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar, Casey et al., 2010Casey B.J. Duhoux S. Malter Cohen M.

Brain Cogn. 2010; 72: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). For example, during adolescence, areas of the brain that process reward develop earlier than the prefrontal cortex, which could explain adolescents’ tendency toward reward-seeking behavior (Galvan et al., 2006Galvan A. Hare T.A. Parra C.E. Penn J. Voss H. Glover G. Casey B.J. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6885-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Although much of the prior research has focused on how these brain differences give rise to risky decision making that may lead to problematic outcomes (Galvan, 2013Galvan A. Curr. Dir. Psychol. Sci. 2013; 22: 88-93Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the research presented by Davidow et al., 2016Davidow J.Y. Foerde K. Galván A. Shohamy D. Neuron. 2016; 92 (this issue): 93-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar suggests that these brain differences may actually result in adaptive strategies, such as during reward-based learning. Davidow et al., 2016Davidow J.Y. Foerde K. Galván A. Shohamy D. Neuron. 2016; 92 (this issue): 93-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar examine whether reward sensitivity in adolescence improves learning when reinforcement is involved, as well as how differences in learning between adolescents and adults relate to interactions between the ventral striatum and the hippocampus. Using a probabilistic learning task, they tested whether adolescents (ages 13–17) differed significantly from adults (ages 20–30) in terms of accuracy during learning, later episodic memory, and brain functionality. During fMRI data acquisition, participants were asked to pair different colored butterflies with various habitats. Similar to the weather prediction task, each butterfly was probabilistically associated with one habitat 80% of the time, and the other habitat 20% of the time. Responses were continuously reinforced by “correct” and “incorrect” feedback, so to succeed on the task, participants needed to update their choices based on previous feedback. Participants also saw images of objects while viewing feedback. After completing the task, participants completed a post-learning memory test about the butterfly task outside the scanner. In this episodic memory test, participants were shown the object images they originally viewed during feedback presentation, as well as new images, and then were asked to identify which photos they had already seen in the original task. Davidow et al., 2016Davidow J.Y. Foerde K. Galván A. Shohamy D. Neuron. 2016; 92 (this issue): 93-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar found that the adolescents in their study showed better probabilistic learning performance than adults. Moreover, the authors also examined learning rates in their task, or the extent to which participants weighted new feedback to update future choices. Updating choices too quickly actually leads to suboptimal performance during this task, due to its probabilistic nature; too high of a learning rate would be like deciding that because it rained on what looked like a clear day yesterday, clear skies are now a sign that rain is imminent. Thus, a lower learning rate is more optimal because it discounts incongruous feedback. A slower learning rate suggests learning over a longer history of trials, rather than making predictions based only on the most recent trials. Davidow et al., 2016Davidow J.Y. Foerde K. Galván A. Shohamy D. Neuron. 2016; 92 (this issue): 93-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar found that the adolescents in their task exhibited lower learning rates. Additionally, although episodic memory in the adolescents was not significantly better than in adults, adolescents exhibited a significant relationship between prediction error and later memory: that is, prediction errors significantly related to stronger episodic memory for adolescents, while adults did not exhibit this relationship. Davidow et al., 2016Davidow J.Y. Foerde K. Galván A. Shohamy D. Neuron. 2016; 92 (this issue): 93-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar also present evidence that suggests that differences between adolescents’ and adults’ learning may be a result of greater interaction between reinforcement learning and episodic memory processes in the adolescent brain. They found that both adults and adolescents showed correlations between behavioral prediction errors and activity in the striatum. However, adolescents exhibited significantly greater prediction error-related activity in the hippocampus compared to adults. The authors conducted a psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis to examine functional connectivity between the striatum and the hippocampus. When examining correct versus incorrect trials, Davidow et al., 2016Davidow J.Y. Foerde K. Galván A. Shohamy D. Neuron. 2016; 92 (this issue): 93-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar found greater connectivity between the putamen, a subregion within the striatum, and the hippocampus, but only in adolescents. They also found a significant correlation in adolescents between this connectivity and the extent to which positively reinforced events were remembered. Thus, the neural processes underlying episodic memory seem to better incorporate reward-related information in the adolescent than the adult brain. Although many studies have focused on the negative aspects in which reward-seeking behavior and reward sensitivity plague adolescents, Davidow et al., 2016Davidow J.Y. Foerde K. Galván A. Shohamy D. Neuron. 2016; 92 (this issue): 93-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar present a convincing argument for when reward sensitivity in adolescence can have an adaptive side. Their results suggest that in a probabilistic learning setting, reward-sensitive adolescents can outperform adults. Their neural data also suggest that enhanced prediction error-related interactions between the hippocampus and striatum heighten memory for positively reinforced events. Their findings also suggest that the relationship between the striatum and hippocampus may have a stronger influence on learning during adolescence, which may enhance reward-seeking behavior, as well as reward-related memories. Future studies could examine whether and how underdeveloped prefrontal regions in adolescents alter interactions in this brain circuit, and how these interactions relate to behavioral flexibility and control. Another area of interest may be to examine whether participants who are more likely to make risky decisions in the real world are also better probabilistic learners in the laboratory. Davidow et al., 2016Davidow J.Y. Foerde K. Galván A. Shohamy D. Neuron. 2016; 92 (this issue): 93-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar’s findings, however, should not be taken to mean that adolescents will necessarily be better at all types of reinforcement learning than adults. For example, adults seem to outperform adolescents on tasks that emphasize learning from negative feedback (Christakou et al., 2013Christakou A. Gershman S.J. Niv Y. Simmons A. Brammer M. Rubia K. J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2013; 25: 1807-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Further, whereas in a probabilistic learning task a lower learning rate is optimal, it remains unclear whether adolescents would outperform adults in a deterministic task, where the correct answer remains fixed, and therefore higher learning rates result in better performance (Ashby and Maddox, 2005Ashby F.G. Maddox W.T. Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2005; 56: 149-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). In this context, one wonders whether adolescents would also exhibit lower learning rates, or if they would be better than adults at adjusting their learning rates to meet the demands of the task. When one thinks of reward-seeking behavior in adolescence, one usually thinks of the “sex, drugs, and rock and roll” portrayed in Hollywood movies and not how risky behaviors are the result of reward-seeking mechanisms in the brain that may actually be adaptive. Although seeking both health-positive and health-negative reward during adolescence can relate to long-lasting habits and memories, one should consider how the adolescent brain processes reward when hoping to steer an adolescent in the “most rewarding” direction. An Upside to Reward Sensitivity: The Hippocampus Supports Enhanced Reinforcement Learning in AdolescenceDavidow et al.NeuronOctober 05, 2016In BriefDavidow et al. discover adaptive consequences of reward sensitivity in adolescence. Adolescents showed better reinforcement learning and enhanced memory for positive feedback events, both related to prediction error-related activation in the hippocampus and greater hippocampal-striatal functional connectivity.

This prospective study analysed the clinical and wear analyses of 9 large Metal-on-Metal (MoM) total hip arthroplasties (THA) to understand the underlying mechanisms of failure. The MoM bearings were revised for multiple reasons; the main reason was pseudotumor formation.From 2006 till 2010 the Reinier de Graaf Hospital implanted 160 large head M2a-Magnum™ (Biomet Inc. Warsaw, Indiana, USA) THAs in 150 patients. The first year, 9 bearings were revised and analysed at the Biomechanics Section, Hamburg University of Technology, Germany. We performed clinical (Harris Hip Score, radiographic analysis, blood cobalt and chromium) and wear analysis (implant, tissue and fluid) of the 9 bearings. Since this study did not fall under the scope of the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act in The Netherlands, no ethical approval was necessary. In this prospective study all patient details were anonymized by the corresponding author, all other authors were blinded during the research and wear analyses. Patients with bilateral MoM implants were excluded.The 9 bearings had a median (IQR) survival of 41.0 (25) months in situ. From these bearings, three showed no noticeable wear. The median (IQR) head wear volume was 3.2 (3.6) mm3 and maximum wear depth 0.02 (0.02) mm. For the cup the median (IQR) wear volume was 0.23 (0.3) mm3 with a maximum wear depth of 0.03 (0.05) mm.An early identification of parameters related to failure of the MoM THA, such as pain, decreased range of motion, radiographic changes and high levels of blood cobalt and chromium is of great importance for patient's quality of life. Especially now patients and surgeons face the long term effects of all these bearings still in situ. This study reports the clinical and wear analyses of 9 MoM THA. In the majority of this group the reason for revision was pseudotumor formation. Most bearings showed signs of wear, however with a great diversity in clinical analysis, in inclination angle, serum cobalt and chromium levels as well as wear analysis. For a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms related with failure, more wear analyses of revised MoM bearings are necessary as well as a frequent follow-up of the patients with a MoM bearing."
https://openalex.org/W2529852174,"Bacterial glycoproteins are associated with physiological and pathogenic functions of bacteria. It remains unclear whether bacterial glycoproteins can bind to specific classes of lectins expressed on host cells. Tannerella forsythia is a gram-negative oral anaerobe that contributes to the development of periodontitis. In this study, we aimed to find lectin-binding glycoproteins in T. forsythia. We performed affinity chromatography of wheat germ agglutinin, which binds to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and sialic acid (Sia), and identified OmpA-like protein as the glycoprotein that has the highest affinity. Mass spectrometry revealed that OmpA-like protein contains O-type N-acetylhexosamine and hexose. Fluorometry quantitatively showed that OmpA-like protein contains Sia. OmpA-like protein was found to bind to lectins including E-selectin, P-selectin, L-selectin, Siglec-5, Siglec-9, Siglec-10, and DC-SIGN. The binding of OmpA-like protein to these lectins, except for the Siglecs, depends on the presence of calcium. N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc), which is the most abundant Sia, inhibited the binding of OmpA-like protein to all of these lectins, whereas GlcNAc and mannose only inhibited the binding to DC-SIGN. We further found that T. forsythia adhered to human oral epithelial cells, which express E-selectin and P-selectin, and that this adhesion was inhibited by addition of NeuAc. Moreover, adhesion of an OmpA-like protein-deficient T. forsythia strain to the cells was reduced compared to that of the wild-type strain. Our findings indicate that OmpA-like protein of T. forsythia contains O-linked sugar chains that can mediate interactions with specific lectins. This interaction is suggested to facilitate adhesion of T. forsythia to the surface of host cells."
https://openalex.org/W2527850368,"Background Laboratory diagnostic tests have an essential role in patient care, and the increasing number of medical and health professions schools focusing on teaching laboratory medicine to pre-clinical students reflects this importance. However, data validating the pedagogical methods that best influence students’ comprehension and interpretation of diagnostic tests have not been well described. The Gram stain is a simple yet significant and frequently used diagnostic test in the clinical setting that helps classify bacteria into two major groups, Gram positive and negative, based on their cell wall structure. Methods and Findings We used this technique to assess which educational strategies may improve students’ learning and competency in medical diagnostic techniques. Hence, in this randomized controlled study, we compared the effectiveness of several educational strategies (e.g. workshop, discussion, or lecture) in first year medical students’ competency in comprehension and interpretation of the Gram stain procedure. We demonstrated that a hands-on practical workshop significantly enhances students’ competency in memorization and overall comprehension of the technique. Interestingly, most students irrespective of their cohort showed difficulty in answering Gram stain-related analytical questions, suggesting that more emphasis should be allocated by the instructors to clearly explain the interpretation of the diagnostic test results to students in medical and health professional schools. Conclusion This proof of principle study highlights the need of practical experiences on laboratory medical techniques during pre-clinical training to facilitate future medical doctors’ and healthcare professionals’ basic understanding and competency in diagnostic testing for better patient care."

During massive transfusion, these devices are used with compression sleeve, which induce a major stress to red blood cells. In this setting, the combination of blood warmer and compression sleeve could generate hemolysis and harm the patient. We conducted this study to compare the impact of different pressure rates on the hemolysis of packed red blood cells and on the outlet temperature when a blood warmer set at 41.5°C is used.Pressure rates tested were 150 and 300 mmHg. Ten packed red blood cells units were provided by Héma-Québec and each unit was sequentially tested.We found no increase in hemolysis either at 150 or 300 mmHg. By cons, we found that the blood warmer was not effective at warming the red blood cells at the specified temperature. At 150 mmHg, the outlet temperature reached 37.1°C and at 300 mmHg, the temperature was 33.7°C.To use a blood warmer set at 41.5°C in conjunction with a compression sleeve at 150 or 300 mmHg does not generate hemolysis. At 300 mmHg a blood warmer set at 41.5°C does not totally avoid a risk of hypothermia."
