https://openalex.org/W2035577930,"Atomic Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) can be used to study many-body phenomena, such as superconductivity, that occur in more complex systems. However, many intriguing phenomena occur for charged particles in a magnetic field, and BECs are neutral. This drawback can be avoided by rotating the neutral system to create a synthetic magnetic field, but such fields are of limited strength. Lin et al. report a method of optically synthesizing magnetic fields for ultracold neutral atoms that is not subject to the limitations of the rotational approach. The method has the potential to generate the high fields required to reach the quantum Hall regime, which would enable studies of topological quantum computation. Atomic Bose–Einstein condensates can be used to study many-body phenomena that occur in more complex material systems; however, the charge neutrality of these systems prevents intriguing phenomena that occur for charged particles in a magnetic field. Rotation can be used to create a synthetic magnetic field, but such fields are of limited strength. An optically synthesized magnetic field for ultracold neutral atoms that is not subject to the limitations of rotating systems is now experimentally realized. Neutral atomic Bose condensates and degenerate Fermi gases have been used to realize important many-body phenomena in their most simple and essential forms1,2,3, without many of the complexities usually associated with material systems. However, the charge neutrality of these systems presents an apparent limitation—a wide range of intriguing phenomena arise from the Lorentz force for charged particles in a magnetic field, such as the fractional quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional electron systems4,5. The limitation can be circumvented by exploiting the equivalence of the Lorentz force and the Coriolis force to create synthetic magnetic fields in rotating neutral systems. This was demonstrated by the appearance of quantized vortices in pioneering experiments6,7,8,9 on rotating quantum gases, a hallmark of superfluids or superconductors in a magnetic field. However, because of technical issues limiting the maximum rotation velocity, the metastable nature of the rotating state and the difficulty of applying stable rotating optical lattices, rotational approaches are not able to reach the large fields required for quantum Hall physics10,11,12. Here we experimentally realize an optically synthesized magnetic field for ultracold neutral atoms, which is evident from the appearance of vortices in our Bose–Einstein condensate. Our approach uses a spatially dependent optical coupling between internal states of the atoms, yielding a Berry’s phase13 sufficient to create large synthetic magnetic fields, and is not subject to the limitations of rotating systems. With a suitable lattice configuration, it should be possible to reach the quantum Hall regime, potentially enabling studies of topological quantum computation."
https://openalex.org/W2003219770,"Dietary restriction extends healthy lifespan in diverse organisms and reduces fecundity. It is widely assumed to induce adaptive reallocation of nutrients from reproduction to somatic maintenance, aiding survival of food shortages in nature. If this were the case, long life under dietary restriction and high fecundity under full feeding would be mutually exclusive, through competition for the same limiting nutrients. Here we report a test of this idea in which we identified the nutrients producing the responses of lifespan and fecundity to dietary restriction in Drosophila. Adding essential amino acids to the dietary restriction condition increased fecundity and decreased lifespan, similar to the effects of full feeding, with other nutrients having little or no effect. However, methionine alone was necessary and sufficient to increase fecundity as much as did full feeding, but without reducing lifespan. Reallocation of nutrients therefore does not explain the responses to dietary restriction. Lifespan was decreased by the addition of amino acids, with an interaction between methionine and other essential amino acids having a key role. Hence, an imbalance in dietary amino acids away from the ratio optimal for reproduction shortens lifespan during full feeding and limits fecundity during dietary restriction. Reduced activity of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling pathway extends lifespan in diverse organisms, and we find that it also protects against the shortening of lifespan with full feeding. In other organisms, including mammals, it may be possible to obtain the benefits to lifespan of dietary restriction without incurring a reduction in fecundity, through a suitable balance of nutrients in the diet."
https://openalex.org/W2160903751,"X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy are two powerful tools used by structural biologists to determine the three-dimensional structures and characterize the dynamic properties of proteins. In this paper, the authors used both of these methods to identify and characterize a 'hidden' high-energy substate of human cyclophilin A, a proline isomerase. This was made possible by engineering a modified form of the enzyme incorporating a mutation at a distance from the active site that could stabilize this previously hidden conformation by inverting the equilibrium between the various substates and reducing the conformational interconversion rates and the catalytic rate. This approach should be broadly applicable to many other proteins and could lead to the reinterpretation of crystal structures determined previously. X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy are two powerful tools to determine the three-dimensional structures and characterize the dynamic properties of proteins. The two methods are now combined to structurally unravel interconverting substrates of a human proline isomerase. Crystallographic approaches are used to define minor protein conformations and, combined with NMR analysis, to show how collective motions contribute to the catalytic power of an enzyme. A long-standing challenge is to understand at the atomic level how protein dynamics contribute to enzyme catalysis. X-ray crystallography can provide snapshots of conformational substates sampled during enzymatic reactions1, while NMR relaxation methods reveal the rates of interconversion between substates and the corresponding relative populations1,2. However, these current methods cannot simultaneously reveal the detailed atomic structures of the rare states and rationalize the finding that intrinsic motions in the free enzyme occur on a timescale similar to the catalytic turnover rate. Here we introduce dual strategies of ambient-temperature X-ray crystallographic data collection and automated electron-density sampling to structurally unravel interconverting substates of the human proline isomerase, cyclophilin A (CYPA, also known as PPIA). A conservative mutation outside the active site was designed to stabilize features of the previously hidden minor conformation. This mutation not only inverts the equilibrium between the substates, but also causes large, parallel reductions in the conformational interconversion rates and the catalytic rate. These studies introduce crystallographic approaches to define functional minor protein conformations and, in combination with NMR analysis of the enzyme dynamics in solution, show how collective motions directly contribute to the catalytic power of an enzyme."

The core then gravitationally collapses to a neutron star or a black hole, leading to an explosion-an iron-core-collapse supernova. By contrast, extremely massive stars with M(initial) >or= 140M[symbol: see text] (if such exist) develop oxygen cores with masses, M(core), that exceed 50M[symbol: see text], where high temperatures are reached at relatively low densities. Conversion of energetic, pressure-supporting photons into electron-positron pairs occurs before oxygen ignition and leads to a violent contraction which triggers a nuclear explosion that unbinds the star in a pair-instability supernova. Transitional objects with 100M[symbol: see text] < M(initial) < 140M[symbol: see text] may end up as iron-core-collapse supernovae following violent mass ejections, perhaps as a result of brief episodes of pair instability, and may already have been identified. Here we report observations of supernova SN 2007bi, a luminous, slowly evolving object located within a dwarf galaxy. We estimate the exploding core mass to be M(core) approximately 100M[symbol: see text], in which case theory unambiguously predicts a pair-instability supernova. We show that >3M[symbol: see text] of radioactive (56)Ni was synthesized during the explosion and that our observations are well fitted by models of pair-instability supernovae. This indicates that nearby dwarf galaxies probably host extremely massive stars, above the apparent Galactic stellar mass limit, which perhaps result from processes similar to those that created the first stars in the Universe."
https://openalex.org/W2169868455,"External climate influences — such as changes in solar radiation or insolation — generate different responses in different regions. There are extensive records from high and low latitudes with which to assess the relationship between insolation and climate variability. But tropical records are much rarer, and records from regions in the path of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, which produces the monsoonal climate of alternating wet and dry seasons, are rarer still. Verschuren et al. have found one such record and analyse proxies of hydrologic variability in the 25,000-year sediment sequence of Lake Challa, a crater lake on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro. They find that monsoon rainfall in East Africa varied in cycles of about 11,500 years, in phase with orbitally controlled solar radiation forcing. Extensive records exist with which to assess the relationship between external climate forcings — such as changes in insolation — and climate variability for middle and high latitudes, but records from equatorial regions are relatively few, especially from regions experiencing the passage of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. A continuous and well-resolved climate-proxy record of hydrological variability during the past 25,000 years from equatorial East Africa is now presented and analysed. External climate forcings—such as long-term changes in solar insolation—generate different climate responses in tropical and high latitude regions1. Documenting the spatial and temporal variability of past climates is therefore critical for understanding how such forcings are translated into regional climate variability. In contrast to the data-rich middle and high latitudes, high-quality climate-proxy records from equatorial regions are relatively few2,3,4, especially from regions experiencing the bimodal seasonal rainfall distribution associated with twice-annual passage of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Here we present a continuous and well-resolved climate-proxy record of hydrological variability during the past 25,000 years from equatorial East Africa. Our results, based on complementary evidence from seismic-reflection stratigraphy and organic biomarker molecules in the sediment record of Lake Challa near Mount Kilimanjaro, reveal that monsoon rainfall in this region varied at half-precessional (∼11,500-year) intervals in phase with orbitally controlled insolation forcing. The southeasterly and northeasterly monsoons that advect moisture from the western Indian Ocean were strengthened in alternation when the inter-hemispheric insolation gradient was at a maximum; dry conditions prevailed when neither monsoon was intensified and modest local March or September insolation weakened the rain season that followed. On sub-millennial timescales, the temporal pattern of hydrological change on the East African Equator bears clear high-northern-latitude signatures, but on the orbital timescale it mainly responded to low-latitude insolation forcing. Predominance of low-latitude climate processes in this monsoon region can be attributed to the low-latitude position of its continental regions of surface air flow convergence, and its relative isolation from the Atlantic Ocean, where prominent meridional overturning circulation more tightly couples low-latitude climate regimes to high-latitude boundary conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2039778506,"The pathway by which ubiquitin chains are generated on substrate through a cascade of enzymes consisting of an E1, E2 and E3 remains unclear. Multiple distinct models involving chain assembly on E2 or substrate have been proposed. However, the speed and complexity of the reaction have precluded direct experimental tests to distinguish between potential pathways. Here we introduce new theoretical and experimental methodologies to address both limitations. A quantitative framework based on product distribution predicts that the really interesting new gene (RING) E3 enzymes SCFCdc4 and SCFβ-TrCP work with the E2 Cdc34 to build polyubiquitin chains on substrates by sequential transfers of single ubiquitins. Measurements with millisecond time resolution directly demonstrate that substrate polyubiquitylation proceeds sequentially. Our results present an unprecedented glimpse into the mechanism of RING ubiquitin ligases and illuminate the quantitative parameters that underlie the rate and pattern of ubiquitin chain assembly. Conjugation of ubiquitin chains onto proteins is an important post-translational modification controlling the stability, localization and activity of proteins. In this process, a series of enzymes (E1, E2 and E3) mediates assembly of ubiquitin chains, and when appropriately ubiquitinated a redundant or damaged protein is destroyed by the proteasome. The mechanism of ubiquitin chain formation is unclear. Ray Deshaies and colleagues use biochemical and computational approaches to study ubiquitin chain formation at millisecond time resolution. Their findings support the proposal that ubiquitin chains are built on substrates by sequential transfer of single ubiquitin molecules. This work should help the search for therapeutics targeting ubiquitination enzymes. Conjugation of ubiquitin chains onto proteins is an important post-translational modification that regulates the stability, localization and activity of substrate proteins. A series of enzymes known as E1, E2 and E3 mediate assembly of ubiquitin chains but the pathway remains unclear. Theoretical and experimental methodologies are now introduced to study the formation of ubiquitin chains at millisecond time resolution, demonstrating that substrate polyubiquitylation proceeds sequentially."
https://openalex.org/W2084136796,"The transcription factor SNAIL1 is a master regulator of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. SNAIL1 is a very unstable protein, and its levels are regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase beta-TrCP1 that interacts with SNAIL1 upon its phosphorylation by GSK-3beta. Here we show that SNAIL1 polyubiquitylation and degradation may occur in conditions precluding SNAIL1 phosphorylation by GSK-3beta, suggesting that additional E3 ligases participate in the control of SNAIL1 protein stability. In particular, we demonstrate that the F-box E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXl14 interacts with SNAIL1 and promotes its ubiquitylation and proteasome degradation independently of phosphorylation by GSK-3beta. In vivo, inhibition of FBXl14 using short hairpin RNA stabilizes both ectopically expressed and endogenous SNAIL1. Moreover, the expression of FBXl14 is potently down-regulated during hypoxia, a condition that increases the levels of SNAIL1 protein but not SNAIL1 mRNA. FBXL14 mRNA is decreased in tumors with a high expression of two proteins up-regulated in hypoxia, carbonic anhydrase 9 and TWIST1. In addition, Twist1 small interfering RNA prevents hypoxia-induced Fbxl14 down-regulation and SNAIL1 stabilization in NMuMG cells. Altogether, these results demonstrate the existence of an alternative mechanism controlling SNAIL1 protein levels relevant for the induction of SNAIL1 during hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2085477318,"The pathogenesis of ischemic stroke is a complex sequence of events including inflammatory reaction, for which the microglia appears to be a major cellular contributor. However, whether post-ischemic activation of microglial cells has beneficial or detrimental effects remains to be elucidated, in particular on long term brain plasticity events. The objective of our study was to determine, through modulation of post-stroke inflammatory response, to what extent microglial cells are involved in some specific events of neuronal plasticity, neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis. Since microglia is a source of neurotrophic factors, the identification of the brain-derived neurophic factor (BDNF) as possible molecular actor involved in these events was also attempted. As a means of down-regulating the microglial response induced by ischemia, 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB, 90 mg/kg, i.p.) was used to inhibit the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). Indeed, PARP-1 contributes to the activation of the transcription factor NF-kB, which is essential to the upregulation of proinflammatory genes, in particular responsible for microglial activation/proliferation. Experiments were conducted in rats subjected to photothrombotic ischemia which leads to a strong and early microglial cells activation/proliferation followed by an infiltration of macrophages within the cortical lesion, events evaluated at serial time points up to 1 month post-ictus by immunostaining for OX-42 and ED-1. Our most striking finding was that the decrease in acute microglial activation induced by 3-AB was associated with a long term down-regulation of two neuronal plasticity proteins expression, synaptophysin (marker of synaptogenesis) and GAP-43 (marker of neuritogenesis) as well as to a significant decrease in tissue BDNF production. Thus, our data argue in favour of a supportive role for microglia in brain neuroplasticity stimulation possibly through BDNF production, suggesting that a targeted protection of microglial cells could represent an innovative approach to potentiate post-stroke neuroregeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2007604850,"Estimates of the total number of bacterial species indicate that existing DNA sequence databases carry only a tiny fraction of the total amount of DNA sequence space represented by this division of life. Indeed, environmental DNA samples have been shown to encode many previously unknown classes of proteins and RNAs. Bioinformatics searches of genomic DNA from bacteria commonly identify new noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as riboswitches. In rare instances, RNAs that exhibit more extensive sequence and structural conservation across a wide range of bacteria are encountered. Given that large structured RNAs are known to carry out complex biochemical functions such as protein synthesis and RNA processing reactions, identifying more RNAs of great size and intricate structure is likely to reveal additional biochemical functions that can be achieved by RNA. We applied an updated computational pipeline to discover ncRNAs that rival the known large ribozymes in size and structural complexity or that are among the most abundant RNAs in bacteria that encode them. These RNAs would have been difficult or impossible to detect without examining environmental DNA sequences, indicating that numerous RNAs with extraordinary size, structural complexity, or other exceptional characteristics remain to be discovered in unexplored sequence space."

These systems feature ribonucleases that prevent the accumulation of nonfunctional RNAs as well as regulate normal mRNAs and repress viral and parasitic RNAs (1Doma M.K. Parker R. Cell. 2007; 131: 660-668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The exosome, a highly conserved RNA-processing protein complex, plays a key role in RNA surveillance by providing the major 3′–5′ exoribonucleolytic activity in eukaryotes (2Vanacova S. Stefl R. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm, the exosome degrades aberrant noncoding and coding RNAs and catalyzes the accurate 3′ end formation of rRNAs, small nuclear RNAs, and small nucleolar RNAs (3Butler J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 90-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 4Houseley J. Tollervey D. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the exosome is composed of a nine-subunit core complex and the nuclear/cytoplasmic endo-exoribonuclease Dis3/Rrp44. These components interact with the nuclear riboexonuclease Rrp6 to form the nuclear exosome. Structure and function studies on the exosome from yeast and humans showed that its structural integrity requires a nine-subunit core, which is similar to the archael exosome and bacterial polynucleotide phosphorylase (5Lorentzen E. Conti E. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 473-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6Lorentzen E. Walter P. Fribourg S. Evguenieva-Hackenberg E. Klug G. Conti E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Despite this similarity to these exonuclease-competent complexes, the yeast and human core exosome appear to possess no catalytic activity. Indeed, all of the catalytic activity resides in Dis3/Rrp44 and Rrp6 (7Dziembowski A. Lorentzen E. Conti E. Séraphin B. Nat. Struct. Mol.

In yeast, aberrant noncoding RNAs are recognized and polyadenylated by the poly(A) polymerases Trf4 and Trf5p, which function in complexes termed TRAMP4 and TRAMP5, respectively, and contain the RNA helicase Mtr4 and the zinc knuckle proteins Air1 and Air2 (13Kadaba S.

The initial characterization of this pathway showed that the nuclear exosome and TRAMP participate in the surveillance and degradation of pre-tRNAiMet (16Kadaba S. Krueger A. Trice T. Krecic A.M.

The current model for RNA surveillance by the nuclear exosome implies that Rrp6 activity acts in concert with the core exosome complex, either through physical association or close coupling. Indeed, affinity purifications of core exosome subunits co-purify all of the other core polypeptides, as well as Dis3/Rrp44 and Rrp6, and affinity purification of Rrp6 co-purifies all of the core subunits and Dis3/Rrp44 (24Krogan N.J.

The inactivity of the nine-subunit core of the exosome indicates that the observed RNA degradation results from the action of the hydrolytic exoribonucleases Dis3/Rrp44 and/or Rrp6 present in the exosome preparations. Moreover, recent findings suggest that Rrp6 can act independently of the core exosome and Dis3/Rrp44 in the degradation of poly(A)+ rRNAs (26Callahan K.P. Butler J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 6645-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, we undertook a series of experiments to identify the component(s) of the exosome that is the target of TRAMP enhancement.Here, we report that the TRAMP complex in vitro does not significantly enhance RNA degradation by purified core exosomes containing Dis3/Rrp44 but lacking Rrp6. Instead, we observe a 10-fold enhancement of recombinant Rrp6 catalytic activity by TRAMP. The enhancement by TRAMP requires no ATP or polyadenylation activity, suggesting that neither the poly(A) polymerase activity of Trf4 nor the helicase activity of Mtr4 plays a role in the enhancement. These results suggest that Rrp6 is a direct target of TRAMP enhancement.DISCUSSIONThe evidence reported here suggests that the TRAMP complex enhances the activity of the exoribonuclease Rrp6. We found that RNA degradation by purified core exosomes containing Dis3/Rrp44, but lacking Rrp6, is not significantly enhanced by TRAMP in vitro. In contrast, TRAMP enhanced the rate of RNA degradation by recombinant GST-Rrp6. This increased activity results from enhancement of the hydrolytic activity of Rrp6 because TRAMP does not hydrolyze RNA alone and cannot enhance the activity of an Rrp6 mutant lacking a key amino acid side chain in its active site. Thus, these findings suggest that Rrp6 may be a direct target of TRAMP during RNA surveillance in S. cerevisiae.Previous reports showed that purified TRAMP enhanced RNA degradation by the nuclear exosome in vitro (14LaCava J.

However, those experiments did not identify the exoribonucleolytic component(s) of the nuclear exosome enhanced by TRAMP. Our findings indicate that the TRAMP complex significantly enhances the activity of Rrp6 in vitro, but not the activity of exosomes containing Dis3/Rrp44 but lacking Rrp6. The 10-fold enhancement of Rrp6 activity observed in the absence of the core exosome compares well with the magnitude of enhancement by TRAMP of core exosomes containing Rrp6 and Dis3/Rrp44 (14LaCava J. Houseley J. Saveanu C. Petfalski E. Thompson E. Jacquier A. Tollervey D. Cell. 2005; 121: 713-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Mg2+ concentrations used in the previous experiments should significantly inhibit Dis3/Rrp44 activity because our findings, and the experiments of others, showed that Dis3/Rrp44 is active only at much lower concentrations (<1 mm) of the cation (7Dziembowski A. Lorentzen E. Conti E. Séraphin B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 23Schneider C. Anderson J.T. Tollervey D. Mol.

Cell. 2008; 29: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, polyadenylation of RNA substrates by TRAMP occurs very slowly (Fig. 2) (23Schneider C. Anderson J.T. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 324-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, previous experiments show that recombinant Dis3/Rrp44 binds hypomodified tRNAiMet under these conditions, and, although only modest polyadenylation by TRAMP occurs, it does enhance degradation of the RNA by Dis3/Rrp44 (23Schneider C. Anderson J.T. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 324-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The fact that TRAMP enhances Dis3/Rrp44 degradation of purified hypomodified tRNAiMet in the absence of the core exosome but has little effect on the rate of core exosome and Dis3/Rrp44 degradation of our 7 S RNA substrate suggests that the presence of the core exosome and/or the nature of the RNA substrate has significant effects on the activity of Dis3/Rrp44. Indeed, studies in vitro with several model RNA substrates in the presence of Dis3/Rrp44, or the core exosome plus Dis3/Rrp44 showed that the presence of the core exosome inhibits Dis3/Rrp44 activity (8Liu Q. Greimann J.C. Lima C.D. Cell. 2006; 127: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In contrast, reactions containing the core exosome, Dis3/Rrp44p and Rrp6 exhibit the RNA degradation specificity of Rrp6.We observed no ATP or polyadenylation dependence for the enhancement of Rrp6 activity by TRAMP, suggesting that neither the poly(A) polymerase activity of Trf4 nor the helicase activity of Mtr4 plays a role in the enhancement. Moreover, TRAMP depleted of Mtr4 enhanced Rrp6 as well as TRAMP containing Mtr4. Although we cannot exclude effects due to residual Mtr4, it seems likely that it plays no significant role in enhancing Rrp6 activity. Rougemaille et al. (19Rougemaille M. Gudipati R.K. Olesen J.R. Thomsen R. Seraphin B. Libri D. Jensen T.H. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2317-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) showed that TRAMP-dependent degradation of HSP101 mRNA in vivo required the presence of Trf4, but not its catalytic activity, suggesting that Trf4 polyadenylation activity is not required for efficient mRNA degradation by the nuclear exosome. Similarly, global changes in RNA transcript levels caused by the absence of Trf4 do not appear to result from loss of its polyadenylation activity (34San Paolo S. Vanacova S. Schenk L. Scherrer T. Blank D. Keller W. Gerber A.P. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000555Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Experiments in vitro also showed that TRAMP enhanced RNA degradation by the exosome in the absence of ATP (14LaCava J. Houseley J. Saveanu C. Petfalski E. Thompson E. Jacquier A. Tollervey D. Cell. 2005; 121: 713-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). In contrast, other work showed that efficient degradation of tRNAiMet by the nuclear exosome required catalytically active Trf4 and the presence of Mtr4, which require ATP for their polyadenylation and helicase activities, respectively (15Vanácová S. Wolf J. Martin G. Blank D. Dettwiler S. Friedlein A. Langen H. Keith G. Keller W. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e189Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 17Wang X. Jia H. Jankowsky E. Anderson J.T. RNA. 2008; 14: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The different results in vitro obtained by the two groups may reflect combinations of different exosome preparations and RNA substrates that result in different degrees of dependence on polyadenylation and helicase activities of TRAMP. Indeed, TRAMP demonstrates a clear preference for the polyadenylation of hypomodified tRNAiMet, possibly reflecting tertiary structural differences between it and the fully modified tRNAiMet (15Vanácová S. Wolf J. Martin G. Blank D. Dettwiler S. Friedlein A. Langen H. Keith G. Keller W. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e189Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). These findings may reflect separable roles of TRAMP components in RNA substrate recognition and acceleration of substrate degradation. The former activity may result from the RNA binding activities of the Air proteins and the latter from the ATP-dependent activities of Trf4 and Mtr4. The evidence to date suggests that Mtr4 and Trf4 enzymatic activities may be dispensable for some RNA substrates.In the present study, we used recombinant Rrp6 to study the degradation of an RNA containing the 3′ end sequence of 7 S pre-rRNA that is predicted to contain considerable secondary structure. The degradation pattern of these 5′ 32P-labeled RNAs shows a reproducible collection of intermediate products that may reflect pausing or release of Rrp6 from the RNA at base-paired portions of the substrate. The enhancement of degradation by TRAMP does not significantly alter this pattern, suggesting that TRAMP does not increase the processivity of Rrp6. Instead, we favor the idea that a component of TRAMP enhances the RNA binding ability of Rrp6, thereby accelerating substrate degradation. Rrp6 interacts with complexes containing the TRAMP components, thus its association with the putative RNA-binding proteins Air1 or Air2 could serve to enhance RNA binding in an ATP-independent manner (12Vasiljeva L.

TRAMP does significantly enhance the activity of the nuclear exosome component Rrp6. Our studies in vitro complement recent observations in vivo indicating that degradation of some rRNA intermediates require Rrp6, but not the core exosome and Dis3/Rrp44 (4Houseley J. Tollervey D. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26Callahan K.P. Butler J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 6645-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These studies support an exosome-independent role for Rrp6 in RNA surveillance and suggest that enhancement of the degradation of specific transcripts may not require all of the activities of the TRAMP complex. IntroductionEukaryotic cells contain quality-control systems that monitor RNA biogenesis. These systems feature ribonucleases that prevent the accumulation of nonfunctional RNAs as well as regulate normal mRNAs and repress viral and parasitic RNAs (1Doma M.K. Parker R. Cell. 2007; 131: 660-668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The exosome, a highly conserved RNA-processing protein complex, plays a key role in RNA surveillance by providing the major 3′–5′ exoribonucleolytic activity in eukaryotes (2Vanacova S. Stefl R. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm, the exosome degrades aberrant noncoding and coding RNAs and catalyzes the accurate 3′ end formation of rRNAs, small nuclear RNAs, and small nucleolar RNAs (3Butler J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 90-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 4Houseley J. Tollervey D. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the exosome is composed of a nine-subunit core complex and the nuclear/cytoplasmic endo-exoribonuclease Dis3/Rrp44. These components interact with the nuclear riboexonuclease Rrp6 to form the nuclear exosome. Structure and function studies on the exosome from yeast and humans showed that its structural integrity requires a nine-subunit core, which is similar to the archael exosome and bacterial polynucleotide phosphorylase (5Lorentzen E. Conti E. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 473-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6Lorentzen E. Walter P. Fribourg S. Evguenieva-Hackenberg E. Klug G. Conti E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Despite this similarity to these exonuclease-competent complexes, the yeast and human core exosome appear to possess no catalytic activity. Indeed, all of the catalytic activity resides in Dis3/Rrp44 and Rrp6 (7Dziembowski A. Lorentzen E. Conti E. Séraphin B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 8Liu Q. Greimann J.C. Lima C.D. Cell. 2006; 127: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar).The ability of the exosome to distinguish between classes of RNA appears to be driven, in part, by protein co-factors and/or covalent modifications to the RNA (9Mullen T.E. Marzluff W.F. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 50-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 10Bayne E.H. White S.A. Allshire R.C.

Cell. 2006; 21: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Unlike mRNA, the addition of poly(A) tail to noncoding RNAs destabilizes the transcripts. In yeast, aberrant noncoding RNAs are recognized and polyadenylated by the poly(A) polymerases Trf4 and Trf5p, which function in complexes termed TRAMP4 and TRAMP5, respectively, and contain the RNA helicase Mtr4 and the zinc knuckle proteins Air1 and Air2 (13Kadaba S.

PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e189Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). This recognition and poly(A) addition result in the recruitment of the nuclear exosome and subsequent hydrolysis of the RNA. The initial characterization of this pathway showed that the nuclear exosome and TRAMP participate in the surveillance and degradation of pre-tRNAiMet (16Kadaba S. Krueger A. Trice T. Krecic A.M.

The current model for RNA surveillance by the nuclear exosome implies that Rrp6 activity acts in concert with the core exosome complex, either through physical association or close coupling. Indeed, affinity purifications of core exosome subunits co-purify all of the other core polypeptides, as well as Dis3/Rrp44 and Rrp6, and affinity purification of Rrp6 co-purifies all of the core subunits and Dis3/Rrp44 (24Krogan N.J.

Nature. 2002; 415: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (3974) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely the purified core exosomes and nuclear exosomes used in these in vitro experiments contained Rrp6. The inactivity of the nine-subunit core of the exosome indicates that the observed RNA degradation results from the action of the hydrolytic exoribonucleases Dis3/Rrp44 and/or Rrp6 present in the exosome preparations. Moreover, recent findings suggest that Rrp6 can act independently of the core exosome and Dis3/Rrp44 in the degradation of poly(A)+ rRNAs (26Callahan K.P. Butler J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 6645-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, we undertook a series of experiments to identify the component(s) of the exosome that is the target of TRAMP enhancement.Here, we report that the TRAMP complex in vitro does not significantly enhance RNA degradation by purified core exosomes containing Dis3/Rrp44 but lacking Rrp6.

Previous reports have shown that human embryonic stem (ES) cells can be maintained in feeder-free condition. However, absence of feeder cells can be a hostile environment for pluripotent cells and often results in karyotype abnormalities. Instead of animal feeders, human fibroblasts can be used as feeder cells of human ES cells. However, one still has to be concerned about the existence of unidentified pathogens, such as viruses and prions in these non-autologous feeders.This report demonstrates that human induced Pluripotent Stem (iPS) cells can be established and maintained on isogenic parental feeder cells. We tested four independent human skin fibroblasts for the potential to maintain self-renewal of iPS cells. All the fibroblasts tested, as well as their conditioned medium, were capable of maintaining the undifferentiated state and normal karyotypes of iPS cells. Furthermore, human iPS cells can be generated on isogenic parental fibroblasts as feeders. These iPS cells carried on proliferation over 19 passages with undifferentiated morphologies. They expressed undifferentiated pluripotent cell markers, and could differentiate into all three germ layers via embryoid body and teratoma formation.These results suggest that autologous fibroblasts can be not only a source for iPS cells but also be feeder layers. Our results provide a possibility to solve the dilemma by using isogenic fibroblasts as feeder layers of iPS cells. This is an important step toward the establishment of clinical grade iPS cells."
https://openalex.org/W2100768871,"The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) is a key regulator of genes implicated in lipid homeostasis and inflammation. PPARalpha trans-activity is enhanced by recruitment of coactivators such as SRC1 and CBP/p300 and is inhibited by binding of corepressors such as NCoR and SMRT. In addition to ligand binding, PPARalpha activity is regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination. In this report, we demonstrate that hPPARalpha is SUMOylated by SUMO-1 on lysine 185 in the hinge region. The E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and the SUMO E3- ligase PIASy are implicated in this process. In addition, ligand treatment decreases the SUMOylation rate of hPPARalpha. Finally, our results demonstrate that SUMO-1 modification of hPPARalpha down-regulates its trans-activity through the specific recruitment of corepressor NCoR but not SMRT leading to the differential expression of a subset of PPARalpha target genes. In conclusion, hPPARalpha SUMOylation on lysine 185 down-regulates its trans-activity through the selective recruitment of NCoR."
https://openalex.org/W2016068982,"Background Angiogenesis is considered an important factor in the pathogenesis of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) where it has been proposed as a therapeutic target. In other settings, active angiogenesis is characterized by pathologic, immature vessels that lack periendothelial cells. We searched for the presence of immature vessels in RA synovium and analyzed the dynamics of synovial vasculature along the course of the disease, particularly after therapeutic response to TNF antagonists. Methodology/Principal Findings Synovial arthroscopic biopsies from RA, osteoarthritis (OA) and normal controls were analyzed by double labeling of endothelium and pericytes/smooth muscle mural cells to identify and quantify mature/immature blood vessels. To analyze clinicopathological correlations, a cross-sectional study on 82 synovial biopsies from RA patients with variable disease duration and severity was performed. A longitudinal analysis was performed in 25 patients with active disease rebiopsied after anti-TNF-α therapy. We found that most RA synovial tissues contained a significant fraction of immature blood vessels lacking periendothelial coverage, whereas they were rare in OA, and inexistent in normal synovial tissues. Immature vessels were observed from the earliest phases of the disease but their presence or density was significantly increased in patients with longer disease duration, higher activity and severity, and stronger inflammatory cell infiltration. In patients that responded to anti-TNF-α therapy, immature vessels were selectively depleted. The mature vasculature was similarly expanded in early or late disease and unchanged by therapy. Conclusion/Significance RA synovium contains a significant fraction of neoangiogenic, immature blood vessels. Progression of the disease increases the presence and density of immature but not mature vessels and only immature vessels are depleted in response to anti-TNFα therapy. The different dynamics of the mature and immature vascular fractions has important implications for the development of anti-angiogenic interventions in RA."
https://openalex.org/W2014719123,"Lipin-1 is a bifunctional protein involved in lipid metabolism and adipogenesis. Lipin-1 plays a role in the biosynthesis of triacylglycerol through its phosphatidate phosphatase activity and also acts as a transcriptional co-activator of genes involved in oxidative metabolism. Lipin-1 resides in the cytoplasm and translocates to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to catalyze the phosphatidate phosphatase reaction. It also possesses a nuclear localization signal, which is required for its translocation to the nucleus and may therefore be important for lipin-1 co-activator function. Thus, subcellular localization may be an important factor in the regulation of this protein. Here, we show that the nuclear localization signal alone is not sufficient for lipin-1 nuclear localization, and identify lipin-1 interaction with 14-3-3 as a determinant of its subcellular localization. We demonstrate that lipin-1 interacts with 14-3-3 proteins and that overexpression of 14-3-3 promotes the cytoplasmic localization of lipin-1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The effect of 14-3-3 is mediated through a serine-rich domain in lipin-1. Functional mapping of the 14-3-3-interacting region within the serine-rich domain indicates redundancy and cooperativity among several sites, including five phosphorylated serine and threonine residues. Insulin stimulation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes results in increased lipin-1 phosphorylation, enhanced interaction with 14-3-3, and predominantly cytoplasmic localization. In summary, our studies suggest that insulin may modulate the cellular function of lipin-1 by regulating its subcellular localization through interactions with 14-3-3 proteins."

Abnormal values of liver enzymes and presence of replicative HCV-RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells are also observed. Aim of the study was to evaluate occult HCV occurrence in a population unselected for hepatic disease. Methodology/Principal Findings We chose from previous epidemiological studies three series of subjects (n = 276, age range 40–65 years) unselected for hepatic disease. These subjects were tested for the presence of HCV antibodies and HCV-RNA in plasma and in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by using commercial systems. All subjects tested negative for HCV antibodies and plasma HCV-RNA and showed normal levels of liver enzymes; 9/276 patients (3.3%) were positive for HCV-RNA in PBMCs, identifying a subset of subjects with potential occult HCV infection. We could determine the HCV type for 8 of the 9 patients finding type 1a (3 patients), type 1b (2 patients), and type 2a (3 patients). Conclusions The results of this study show evidence that occult HCV infection may occur in a population unselected for hepatic disease. A potential risk of HCV infection spread by subjects harbouring occult HCV infection should be considered. Design of prospective studies focusing on the frequency of infection in the general population and on the clinical evolution of occult HCV infection will be needed to verify this unexpected finding."
https://openalex.org/W2003667906,"p53 can induce apoptosis through mitochondrial membrane permeabilization by interaction of its DNA binding region with the anti-apoptotic proteins BclxL and Bcl2. However, little is known about the action of p53 at the mitochondria in molecular detail. By using NMR spectroscopy and fluorescence polarization we characterized the binding of wild-type and mutant p53 DNA binding domains to BclxL and show that the wild-type p53 DNA binding domain leads to structural changes in the BH3 binding region of BclxL, whereas mutants fail to induce such effects due to reduced affinity. This was probed by induced chemical shift and residual dipolar coupling data. These data imply that p53 partly achieves its pro-apoptotic function at the mitochondria by facilitating interaction between BclxL and BH3-only proteins in an allosteric mode of action. Furthermore, we characterize for the first time the binding behavior of Pifithrin-mu, a specific small molecule inhibitor of the p53-BclxL interaction, and present a structural model of the protein-ligand complex. A rather unusual behavior is revealed whereby Pifithrin-mu binds to both sides of the protein-protein complex. These data should facilitate the rational design of more potent specific BclxL-p53 inhibitors."

The rate at which they enter and exit the intestine has a major effect on blood glucose homeostasis. In this study, we determine the effects of luminal leptin on activity/expression of GLUT2 and GLUT5 transporters in response to sugars intake and analyse their physiological consequences.Wistar rats, wild type and AMPKalpha(2) (-/-) mice were used. In vitro and in vivo isolated jejunal loops were used to quantify transport of fructose and galactose in the absence and the presence of leptin. The effects of fructose and galactose on gastric leptin release were determined. The effects of leptin given orally without or with fructose were determined on the expression of GLUT2/5, on some gluconeogenesis and lipogenic enzymes in the intestine and the liver.First, in vitro luminal leptin activating its receptors coupled to PKCbetaII and AMPKalpha, increased insertion of GLUT2/5 into the brush-border membrane leading to enhanced galactose and fructose transport. Second in vivo, oral fructose but not galactose induced in mice a rapid and potent release of gastric leptin in gastric juice without significant changes in plasma leptin levels. Moreover, leptin given orally at a dose reproducing comparable levels to those induced by fructose, stimulated GLUT5-fructose transport, and potentiated fructose-induced: i) increase in blood glucose and mRNA levels of key gluconeogenesis enzymes; ii) increase in blood triglycerides and reduction of mRNA levels of intestinal and hepatic Fasting-induced adipocyte factor (Fiaf) and iii) increase in SREBP-1c, ACC-1, FAS mRNA levels and dephosphorylation/activation of ACC-1 in liver.These data identify for the first time a positive regulatory control loop between gut leptin and fructose in which fructose triggers release of gastric leptin which, in turn, up-regulates GLUT5 and concurrently modulates metabolic functions in the liver. This loop appears to be a new mechanism (possibly pathogenic) by which fructose consumption rapidly becomes highly lipogenic and deleterious."

Leukocytes from patients with WHIM syndrome display impaired CXCR4 internalization and enhanced chemotaxis in response to its unique ligand SDF-1/CXCL12, which likely contribute to the clinical manifestations. Here, we investigated the biochemical mechanisms underlying CXCR4 deficiency in WHIM syndrome. We report that after ligand activation, WHIM-associated mutant CXCR4 receptors lacking the carboxy-terminal 19 residues internalize and activate Erk 1/2 slower than wild-type (WT) receptors, while utilizing the same trafficking endocytic pathway. Recruitment of β-Arrestin 2, but not β-Arrestin 1, to the active WHIM-mutant receptor is delayed compared to the WT CXCR4 receptor. In addition, while both kinases Grk3 and Grk6 bind to WT CXCR4 and are critical to its trafficking to the lysosomes, Grk6 fails to associate with the WHIM-mutant receptor whereas Grk3 associates normally. Since β-Arrestins and Grks play critical roles in phosphorylation and internalization of agonist-activated G protein-coupled receptors, these results provide a molecular basis for CXCR4 dysfunction in WHIM syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2083366051,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a multifactorial autoimmune disorder where interaction and integration of immune response genes along with environmental factors play a role in autoimmune destruction of the insulin producing Pancreatic Beta cells.We have studied four single nucleotide polymorphisms (FokI site in Exon 2, BsmI and ApaI sites in Intron 8 and TaqI site in exon 9) in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene using PCR-RFLP and HLA-DRB1 alleles using PCR and hybridization with sequence specific oligonucleotide probes and studied their interaction using LD based statistics for non-linked loci followed by sequence analysis of the vitamin D response element (VDRE) present in the promoter region of HLA-DRB1 0301. Haplotypes, constructed using SHEsis program for four single nucleotide polymorphisms in the VDR gene, were studied for their interaction with HLA-DRB1 alleles in 233 T1D patients and 191 healthy controls from North India. A significant increase of haplotypes FBAt and fBAT (p<0.02, OR = 1.44 and p<0.002, OR = 3.23 respectively) was observed in the patients. Both the haplotypes FBAt and fBAT were significantly increased in male patients with age at onset less than 18 years; however, fBAT was significantly increased in female patients irrespective of their age at onset. LD based statistics showed significant interaction between the high producer F and T alleles with HLA-DRB1 0301. F and T alleles of VDR have been shown to contribute to VDR mRNA independently. The promoter sequence analysis of HLA-DRB1 0301 showed presence of VDRE involved in higher expression of HLA-DRB1 030, which was confirmed by flow cytometry and real time PCR analysis.These data suggest that the interaction between VDR and HLA alleles is mediated by VDRE present in the promoter region of HLA-DRB1 0301 allele, which may be detrimental for the manifestation of T1D in the absence of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) in early childhood due to poor expression of DRB1 0301 in the thymus resulting in autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W2037787140,"How transcription factors (TFs) interact with cis-regulatory sequences and interact with each other is a fundamental, but not well understood, aspect of gene regulation.We present a computational method to address this question, relying on the established biophysical principles. This method, STAP (sequence to affinity prediction), takes into account all combinations and configurations of strong and weak binding sites to analyze large scale transcription factor (TF)-DNA binding data to discover cooperative interactions among TFs, infer sequence rules of interaction and predict TF target genes in new conditions with no TF-DNA binding data. The distinctions between STAP and other statistical approaches for analyzing cis-regulatory sequences include the utility of physical principles and the treatment of the DNA binding data as quantitative representation of binding strengths. Applying this method to the ChIP-seq data of 12 TFs in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, we found that the strength of TF-DNA binding could be significantly modulated by cooperative interactions among TFs with adjacent binding sites. However, further analysis on five putatively interacting TF pairs suggests that such interactions may be relatively insensitive to the distance and orientation of binding sites. Testing a set of putative Nanog motifs, STAP showed that a novel Nanog motif could better explain the ChIP-seq data than previously published ones. We then experimentally tested and verified the new Nanog motif. A series of comparisons showed that STAP has more predictive power than several state-of-the-art methods for cis-regulatory sequence analysis. We took advantage of this power to study the evolution of TF-target relationship in Drosophila. By learning the TF-DNA interaction models from the ChIP-chip data of D. melanogaster (Mel) and applying them to the genome of D. pseudoobscura (Pse), we found that only about half of the sequences strongly bound by TFs in Mel have high binding affinities in Pse. We show that prediction of functional TF targets from ChIP-chip data can be improved by using the conservation of STAP predicted affinities as an additional filter.STAP is an effective method to analyze binding site arrangements, TF cooperativity, and TF target genes from genome-wide TF-DNA binding data."
https://openalex.org/W2108871285,"Background Treatment of arterial bifurcation lesions using drug-eluting stents (DES) is now common clinical practice and yet the mechanisms governing drug distribution in these complex morphologies are incompletely understood. It is still not evident how to efficiently determine the efficacy of local drug delivery and quantify zones of excessive drug that are harbingers of vascular toxicity and thrombosis, and areas of depletion that are associated with tissue overgrowth and luminal re-narrowing. Methods and Results We constructed two-phase computational models of stent-deployed arterial bifurcations simulating blood flow and drug transport to investigate the factors modulating drug distribution when the main-branch (MB) was treated using a DES. Simulations predicted extensive flow-mediated drug delivery in bifurcated vascular beds where the drug distribution patterns are heterogeneous and sensitive to relative stent position and luminal flow. A single DES in the MB coupled with large retrograde luminal flow on the lateral wall of the side-branch (SB) can provide drug deposition on the SB lumen-wall interface, except when the MB stent is downstream of the SB flow divider. In an even more dramatic fashion, the presence of the SB affects drug distribution in the stented MB. Here fluid mechanic effects play an even greater role than in the SB especially when the DES is across and downstream to the flow divider and in a manner dependent upon the Reynolds number. Conclusions The flow effects on drug deposition and subsequent uptake from endovascular DES are amplified in bifurcation lesions. When only one branch is stented, a complex interplay occurs – drug deposition in the stented MB is altered by the flow divider imposed by the SB and in the SB by the presence of a DES in the MB. The use of DES in arterial bifurcations requires a complex calculus that balances vascular and stent geometry as well as luminal flow."
https://openalex.org/W2003542991,"E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, which is essential for the maintenance of the architecture and integrity of epithelial tissues, is often lost during carcinoma progression. To better understand the nature of alterations of cell-cell interactions at the early stages of neoplastic evolution of epithelial cells, we examined the line of nontransformed IAR-2 epithelial cells and their descendants, lines of IAR-6-1 epithelial cells transformed with dimethylnitrosamine and IAR1170 cells transformed with N-RasG12D. IAR-6-1 and IAR1170 cells retained E-cadherin, displayed discoid or polygonal morphology, and formed monolayers similar to IAR-2 monolayer. Fluorescence staining, however, showed that in IAR1170 and IAR-6-1 cells the marginal actin bundle, which is typical of nontransformed IAR-2 cells, disappeared, and the continuous adhesion belt (tangential adherens junctions (AJs)) was replaced by radially oriented E-cadherin-based AJs. Time-lapse imaging of IAR-6-1 cells stably transfected with GFP-E-cadherin revealed that AJs in transformed cells are very dynamic and unstable. The regulation of AJ assembly by Rho family small GTPases was different in nontransformed and in transformed IAR epithelial cells. As our experiments with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 and the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin have shown, the formation and maintenance of radial AJs critically depend on myosin II-mediated contractility. Using the RNAi technique for the depletion of mDia1 and loading cells with N17Rac, we established that mDia1 and Rac are involved in the assembly of tangential AJs in nontransformed epithelial cells but not in radial AJs in transformed cells. Neoplastic transformation changed cell-cell interactions, preventing contact paralysis after the establishment of cell-cell contact and promoting dynamic cell-cell adhesion and motile behavior of cells. It is suggested that the disappearance of the marginal actin bundle and rearrangements of AJs may change the adhesive function of E-cadherin and play an active role in migratory activity of carcinoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1967546637,"There has been much interest in targeting intracellular redox pathways as a therapeutic approach for cancer. Given recent data to suggest that the redox status of extracellular protein thiol groups (i.e. exofacial thiols) effects cell behavior, we hypothesized that redox active anti-cancer agents would modulate exofacial protein thiols.To test this hypothesis, we used the sesquiterpene lactone parthenolide, a known anti-cancer agent. Using flow cytometry, and western blotting to label free thiols with Alexa Fluor 633 C(5) maleimide dye and N-(biotinoyl)-N-(iodoacetyl) ethylendiamine (BIAM), respectively, we show that parthenolide decreases the level of free exofacial thiols on Granta mantle lymphoma cells. In addition, we used immuno-precipitation techniques to identify the central redox regulator thioredoxin, as one of the surface protein thiol targets modified by parthenolide. To examine the functional role of parthenolide induced surface protein thiol modification, we pretreated Granta cells with cell impermeable glutathione (GSH), prior to exposure to parthenolide, and showed that GSH pretreatment; (a) inhibited the interaction of parthenolide with exofacial thiols; (b) inhibited parthenolide mediated activation of JNK and inhibition of NFkappaB, two well established mechanisms of parthenolide activity and; (c) blocked the cytotoxic activity of parthenolide. That GSH had no effect on the parthenolide induced generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species supports the fact that GSH had no effect on intracellular redox. Together these data support the likelihood that GSH inhibits the effect of parthenolide on JNK, NFkappaB and cell death through its direct inhibition of parthenolide's modulation of exofacial thiols.Based on these data, we postulate that one component of parthenolide's anti-lymphoma activity derives from its ability to modify the redox state of critical exofacial thiols. Further, we propose that cancer cell exofacial thiols may be important and novel targets for therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2042906241,"A great majority of genetic markers discovered in recent genome-wide association studies have small effect sizes, and they explain only a small fraction of the genetic contribution to the diseases. How many more variants can we expect to discover and what study sizes are needed? We derive the connection between the cumulative risk of the SNP variants to the latent genetic risk model and heritability of the disease. We determine the sample size required for case-control studies in order to achieve a certain expected number of discoveries in a collection of most significant SNPs. Assuming similar allele frequencies and effect sizes of the currently validated SNPs, complex phenotypes such as type-2 diabetes would need approximately 800 variants to explain its 40% heritability. Much smaller numbers of variants are needed if we assume rare-variants but higher penetrance models. We estimate that up to 50,000 cases and an equal number of controls are needed to discover 800 common low-penetrant variants among the top 5000 SNPs. Under common and rare low-penetrance models, the very large studies required to discover the numerous variants are probably at the limit of practical feasibility. Under rare-variant with medium- to high-penetrance models (odds-ratios between 1.6 and 4.0), studies comparable in size to many existing studies are adequate provided the genotyping technology can interrogate more and rarer variants."
https://openalex.org/W2085197293,"Phthalates are synthetic compounds with a widespread field of applications. For example, they are used as plasticizers in PVC plastics and food packaging, or are added to personal care products. Diethyl phthalate (DEP) may be used to denature alcohol, e.g., for cosmetic purposes. Public health concerns of phthalates include carcinogenic, teratogenic, hepatotoxic and endocrine effects. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a method for determining phthalates in alcohol samples and to provide a risk assessment for consumers of such products.A liquid-liquid extraction procedure was optimized by varying the following parameters: type of extraction solvent (cyclohexane, n-hexane, 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane), the ratio extraction solvent/sample volume (1 ratio 1 to 50 ratio 1) and the number of extraction repetitions (1-10). The best extraction yield (99.9%) was achieved with the solvent 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane, an extraction solvent volume/sample volume ratio of 10 ratio 1 and a double extraction. For quantification, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with deuterated internal standards was used. The investigated samples were alcoholic beverages and unrecorded alcohol products from different countries (n = 257). Two unrecorded alcohol samples from Lithuania contained diethyl phthalate in concentrations of 608 mg/L and 210 mg/L.The consumption of the phthalate-positive unrecorded alcohols would exceed tolerable daily intakes as derived from animal experiments. Both positive samples were labelled as cosmetic alcohol, but had clearly been offered for human consumption. DEP seems to be unsuitable as a denaturing agent as it has no effect on the organoleptic properties of ethanol. In light of our results that DEP might be consumed by humans in unrecorded alcohols, the prohibition of its use as a denaturing agent should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2083352113,"Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenous messenger that suppresses inflammation, modulates apoptosis and promotes vascular remodeling. Here, microarrays were employed to globally characterize the CO (250 ppm) suppression of early (1 h) LPS-induced inflammation in human monocytic THP-1 cells. CO suppressed 79 of 101 immediate-early genes induced by LPS; 19% (15/79) were transcription factors and most others were cytokines, chemokines and immune response genes. The prototypic effects of CO on transcription and protein production occurred early but decreased rapidly. CO activated p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and Akt and caused an early and transitory delay in LPS-induced JNK activation. However, selective inhibitors of these kinases failed to block CO suppression of LPS-induced IL-1β, an inflammation marker. Of CO-suppressed genes, 81% (64/79) were found to have promoters with putative NF-κB binding sites. CO was subsequently shown to block LPS-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα in human monocytes, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signal transduction. CO broadly suppresses the initial inflammatory response of human monocytes to LPS by reshaping proximal events in TLR4 signal transduction such as stress kinase responses and early NF-κB activation. These rapid, but transient effects of CO may have therapeutic applications in acute pulmonary and vascular injury."

https://openalex.org/W2057163959,"Background Sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1) is an oncogenic lipid kinase notably involved in response to anticancer therapies in prostate cancer. Androgens regulate prostate cancer cell proliferation, and androgen deprivation therapy is the standard of care in the management of patients with advanced disease. Here, we explored the role of SphK1 in the regulation of androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell growth and survival. Methodology/Principal Findings Short-term androgen removal induced a rapid and transient SphK1 inhibition associated with a reduced cell growth in vitro and in vivo, an event that was not observed in the hormono-insensitive PC-3 cells. Supporting the critical role of SphK1 inhibition in the rapid effect of androgen depletion, its overexpression could impair the cell growth decrease. Similarly, the addition of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to androgen-deprived LNCaP cells re-established cell proliferation, through an androgen receptor/PI3K/Akt dependent stimulation of SphK1, and inhibition of SphK1 could markedly impede the effects of DHT. Conversely, long-term removal of androgen support in LNCaP and C4-2B cells resulted in a progressive increase in SphK1 expression and activity throughout the progression to androgen-independence state, which was characterized by the acquisition of a neuroendocrine (NE)-like cell phenotype. Importantly, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway—by negatively impacting SphK1 activity—could prevent NE differentiation in both cell models, an event that could be mimicked by SphK1 inhibitors. Fascinatingly, the reversability of the NE phenotype by exposure to normal medium was linked with a pronounced inhibition of SphK1 activity. Conclusions/Significance We report the first evidence that androgen deprivation induces a differential effect on SphK1 activity in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cell models. These results also suggest that SphK1 activation upon chronic androgen deprivation may serve as a compensatory mechanism allowing prostate cancer cells to survive in androgen-depleted environment, giving support to its inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy to delay/prevent the transition to androgen-independent prostate cancer."

Leishmaniasis is a significant world wide health problem for which no vaccine exists. In this study we have compared immunogenicity and efficacy of three types of DNA vaccines: single antigen Gp63 (Gp63/pcDNA), polytope (Poly/pcDNA) and Polytope fused with hsp70 (Poly/hsp/pcDNA) against visceral leishmaniasis in susceptible BALB/c mice. Mice vaccinated with these plasmids generated strong Th1 immune response as seen by dominating IFN-γ over IL-10 cytokine. Interestingly, cytotoxic responses generated by polytope DNA plasmid fused with hsp70 of Leishmania donovani were significantly higher when compared to polytope and single antigen Gp63 vaccine. Challenge studies revealed that the parasite load in liver and spleen was significantly lower with Poly/hsp/pcDNA vaccination compared to other vaccines. Therefore, our study indicates that polytope DNA vaccine is a feasible, practical and effective approach for visceral leishmaniasis."
https://openalex.org/W2013880568,"To contribute to the question of the putative role of cystatins in Alzheimer disease and in neuroprotection in general, we studied the interaction between human stefin B (cystatin B) and amyloid-beta-(1-40) peptide (Abeta). Using surface plasmon resonance and electrospray mass spectrometry we were able to show a direct interaction between the two proteins. As an interesting new fact, we show that stefin B binding to Abeta is oligomer specific. The dimers and tetramers of stefin B, which bind Abeta, are domain-swapped as judged from structural studies. Consistent with the binding results, the same oligomers of stefin B inhibit Abeta fibril formation. When expressed in cultured cells, stefin B co-localizes with Abeta intracellular inclusions. It also co-immunoprecipitates with the APP fragment containing the Abeta epitope. Thus, stefin B is another APP/Abeta-binding protein in vitro and likely in cells."
https://openalex.org/W1975380933,"Background The low immunogenicity of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) coupled with negligible expression of MHC antigens has popularized their use in transplantation medicine. However, in an inflammatory environment, the NSPCs express costimulatory molecules and MHC antigens, and also exhibit certain immunomodulatory functions. Since NSPCs are the cellular targets in a number of virus infections both during postnatal and adult stages, we wanted to investigate the immunological properties of these stem cells in response to viral pathogen. Methodology/Principal Findings We utilized both in vivo mouse model and in vitro neurosphere model of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection for the study. The NSPCs residing in the subventricular zone of the infected brains showed prominent expression of MHC-I and costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86. Using Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, we observed increased surface expression of co-stimulatory molecule and MHC class I antigen in NSPCs upon progressive JEV infection in vitro. Moreover, significant production of pro-inflammatory cyto/chemokines was detected in JEV infected NSPCs by Cytokine Bead Array analysis. Interestingly, NSPCs were capable of providing functional costimulation to allogenic T cells and JEV infection resulted in increased proliferation of allogenic T cells, as detected by Mixed Lymphocyte reaction and CFSE experiments. We also report IL-2 production by NSPCs upon JEV infection, which possibly provides mitogenic signals to T cells and trigger their proliferation. Conclusion/Significance The in vivo and in vitro findings clearly indicate the development of immunogenicity in NSPCs following progressive JEV infection, in our case, JEV infection. Following a neurotropic virus infection, NSPCs possibly behave as immunogenic cells and contribute to both the innate and adaptive immune axes. The newly discovered immunological properties of NSPCs may have implications in assigning a new role of these cells as non-professional antigen presenting cells in the central nervous system."

Moreover, IRF4, overexpressed in HTLV-1-infected cells in a Tax-independent manner, negatively controls the transcriptional regulation of these genes.

Cell Res. 2005; 308: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) were described previously. Antibodies against TAK1, TAB1, TAB2, IRF3, IRF4, JNK, p38, ubiquitin, IKKα, p65, green fluorescent protein, actin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, lamin B, and α-tubulin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against phospho-IRF3 (Ser-396), phospho-p65 (Ser-536), phospho-JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185), phospho-p38 (Thr-180/Tyr-182), phospho-IKKα/β (Ser-176/180), IKKβ, IKKγ, and TBK1 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). A proteasome inhibitor N-acetylleucylleucylnorleucinal (ALLN; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Jurkat, Jurkat-derived JPX-9, and HTLV-1-transformed cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HuT-102 cells were stably transfected with pSUPER.gfp+neo vectors (OrigoEngine, Seattle, WA) to express shRNAs against human TAK1 or firefly luciferase. The target sequence for TAK1 is 5′-ATGACGATTCATGAGTGTTAG-3′, which is located in 3′-untranslated region. HuT-shTAK1 and HuT-shLuc cells were selected by 0.8 mg/ml G418 and then sorted by green fluorescent protein expression. Stable transfectants were maintained in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418. For experiments, G418 was removed 36 h before harvest. Whole cell lysates, cytoplasmic extracts, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (21Sakurai H. Suzuki S. Kawasaki N.

Chem. 2003; 278: 36916-36923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P nylon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was treated with BlockAce (Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Suita, Japan) overnight at 4 °C and probed with primary antibodies as described above. Antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, and anti-goat IgG (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) and visualized with the ECL system (GE Healthcare). Total RNA was extracted from cells using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Gene expression was analyzed using a GeneChip® system with Human Genome Array U133 Plus2.0 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) as described previously (22Takasaki I. Takarada S. Fukuchi M. Yasuda M. Tsuda M. Tabuchi Y. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 102: 1472-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this study, a total of four arrays were used: two for HuT-shLuc cells and two for HuT-shTAK1 cells. A fold change value of greater than 1.5 (up-regulated) or less than 1.5 (down-regulated) was considered to be biologically important. The statistical significance of the fold change was calculated for two groups by performing Student's t test, and p values <0.05 were regarded as significant. Cells were transfected with each siRNA for Tax, TBK1, RIG-I, MDA5, IRF3, IRF4, firefly luciferase (Luc) using the Amaxa electroporation system. All siRNAs were designed at and purchased from Invitrogen. Luc siRNA with a two-nucleotide overhang at the 3′-end of the sequence was designed at iGENE Therapeutics (Tokyo, Japan) and synthesized by Hokkaido System Science (Sapporo, Japan) The target sequences are summarized in supplemental Table S1. Total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized by SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The cDNA was amplified quantitatively using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa-Bio, Otsu, Japan). The primer sequences are summarized in supplemental Table S2. Real time quantitative RT-PCR was performed using an ABI Prism 7300 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All data were normalized to β-actin mRNA. The data shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. HeLa cells were cotransfected with reporter plasmids, including the ISRE-driven firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (Stratagene) and pRL-EF1α Renilla luciferase plasmid and Tax expression plasmid using a Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). The Amaxa electroporation system was used for transfection experiments in Jurkat cells. The luciferase activity was measured by using the Dual Luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). The ISRE activity was normalized on the basis of Renilla luciferase activity. We first established Tax-positive HuT-102 cells stably transfected with shRNA expression vectors against TAK1 (HuT-shTAK1) and luciferase (HuT-shLuc). TAK1 protein expression and activating phosphorylation were down-regulated in HuT-shTAK1 cells compared with control HuT-shLuc and parent HuT-102 cells (Fig. 1A). Two TAK1 adaptor proteins, TAB1 and TAB2, were also severely down-regulated at the protein level, although their mRNAs were comparably expressed (Fig. 1, A and B). We reported previously that TAB1 and TAB2 form a stable complex with TAK1 in HuT-102 cells (13Suzuki S. Singhirunnusorn P. Mori A. Yamaoka S. Kitajima I. Saiki I. Sakurai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25177-25181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting that TAK1 has a scaffolding function for stabilization of the complex. In contrast, protein expression (Fig. 1A) and ubiquitination (Fig. 1C) of Tax were not affected by the loss of function of the TAK1 complex. In accordance with our previous results, phosphorylation of JNK/p38 MAPKs (Fig. 1D), but not NF-κB (Fig. 1E), was suppressed in HuT-shTAK1 cells. In addition, proliferation in vitro was comparable (Fig. 1E). We next performed microarray analysis to find TAK1-regulated genes in HTLV-1-transformed cells. Surprisingly, a series of IFN-inducible genes were down-regulated in HuT-shTAK1 cells (Fig. 2A), although IFN-α/β mRNAs were not significantly expressed (data not shown). In contrast, the expressions of NF-κB-regulated genes, including A20 and IκBα, were not changed. Wu and Sun (23Wu X. Sun S.C. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) recently reported that TAK1 is involved in Tax-induced NF-κB activation; however, based on our RNAi experiments, we currently believe that TAK1 is not essential for constitutive activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway. The microarray results were confirmed by real time RT-PCR, in which mRNA expressions of CXCL10, IFIT1, and CCL5 were down-regulated (Fig. 2B). Similarly, the expressions of IFN-inducible genes were suppressed by Tax siRNA (Fig. 2C), indicating that Tax-induced TAK1 activation regulates their transcriptional activation. In contrast, Tax-dependent viral gag expression was independent of TAK1 (Fig. 2D). Moreover, the RNAi experiment verified that TAK1-induced activation of JNK1/2 and p38α is not involved in CXCL10 expression (data not shown), suggesting that TAK1 induces IFN-inducible genes via NF-κB- and MAPK-independent pathways. IRF3 has been characterized as a critical transcriptional activator in IFN-regulated genes upon viral infection (2Sato M. Suemori H. Hata N. Asagiri M. Ogasawara K. Nakao K. Nakaya T. Katsuki M. Noguchi S. Tanaka N. Taniguchi T. Immunity. 2000; 13: 539-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar); however, the role in HTLV-1-infected T cells is still unknown. We set up an RNAi experiment for selective IRF3 knockdown (Fig. 3A). IRF3 siRNA significantly suppressed CXCL10 mRNA expression, but not TAK1-independent viral gag mRNA expression (Fig. 3B). Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that phosphorylation of IRF3 was detected in Tax-positive cell lines (Fig. 4A). The phosphorylation was abrogated by Tax siRNA (Fig. 4B). The ISRE-dependent transcriptional activity and mRNA expression of CXCL10 and CCL5 were induced by ectopic expression of Tax in HeLa and Jurkat cells (supplemental Fig. 1). In addition, IRF3 was inactivated in HuT-shTAK1 cells (Fig. 4C). Moreover, both TAK1 and IRF3 were activated by Tax in an inducible cell line, JPX-9 (Fig. 4D).FIGURE 4Tax-dependent constitutive activation of IRF3 via TAK1. A, nuclear extracts from Jurkat and HTLV-1-transformed cells were immunoblotted with anti-phospho-IRF3 (Ser-396), anti-IRF3, and anti-Tax antibodies. B, HuT-102 cells were transfected with Tax and Luc siRNA and then analyzed by immunoblotting as described in A. C, cytoplasmic (Cyto. Ext.) and nuclear extracts (Nuc.

WCE, whole cell extracts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate upstream regulation of IRF3, we focused on a major IRF3 kinase, TBK1. RNAi experiments demonstrated that TBK1 was essential for phosphorylation of IRF3 (Fig. 5A) and the transcriptional activation of CXCL10 and CCL5 (Fig. 5B). As shown in Fig. 2A, the expression of MDA5 and RIG-I, sensors of viral RNAs that are well known to trigger the TBK1-IRF3 pathway, were down-regulated in HuT-shTAK1 cells. Interestingly, the expressions of these mRNAs were also suppressed by knockdown of Tax (supplemental Fig. 2A). In contrast, IRF3 siRNA did not inhibit the expression of MDA5 and RIG-I (supplemental Fig. 2B). Moreover, knockdown of MDA5 or RIG-I did not inhibit the expression of CXCL10 and phosphorylation of IRF3 (supplemental Fig. 2, C and D). MDA5 and RIG-I recognize viral RNA molecules harboring a 5′-triphosphate end (24Yoneyama M. Fujita T. Immunity. 2008; 29: 178-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar); however, transcripts from the integrated HTLV-1 genome lack the RNA structure. These findings indicate that the expressions of MDA5 and RIG-I are targeted by Tax and TAK1, but the expressed RNA sensor proteins are not involved in the IRF3 activation. Although TAK1 is essential for pathogen-induced activation of NF-κB and MAPKs, TAK1 is dispensable for IFN-α/β expression and IRF3 activation by early vesicular stomatitis virus infection or stimulation with poly(I·C) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (17Yoshida R. Takaesu G. Yoshida H. Okamoto F. Yoshioka T. Choi Y. Akira S. Kawai T. Yoshimura A. Kobayashi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 36211-36220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In comparison with these reports, HuT-102 and MT-2 cells are chronically infected with HTLV-1 and also constitutively express viral Tax oncoprotein. It has recently been reported that Tax interferes with the IFN-α-induced JAK-STAT pathway by competition with STAT2 for CBP/p300 binding (25Zhang J. Yamada O. Kawagishi K. Araki H. Yamaoka S. Hattori T. Shimotohno K. Virology. 2008; 379: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting that Tax controls two different IFN signaling pathways. In addition, the TAK1-JNK cascade is required for IRF3 function in macrophages (18Zhang B. Li M. Chen L. Yang K. Shan Y. Zhu L. Sun S. Li L. Wang C. Cell Res. 2009; 19: 412-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, the RNAi experiment ruled out JNK and p38 in IRF3 phosphorylation in HuT-102 cells (data not shown). Because Tax is associated with IKKγ/NEMO, an adaptor protein that allows RIG-I to activate both the NF-κB and IRF3 signaling pathways (26Jin D.Y. Giordano V. Kibler K.V. Nakano H. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17402-17405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 27Zhao T. Yang L. Sun Q. Arguello M. Ballard D.W. Hiscott J. Lin R. Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 592-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), we further tested the effect of IKKγ siRNA on phosphorylation of IRF3. However, IKKγ knockdown did not affect Tax- and TAK1-dependent activation of IRF3 (supplemental Fig. 3). This is consistent with our previous finding that TAK1 is not able to associate with the Tax·IKKγ complex (13Suzuki S. Singhirunnusorn P. Mori A. Yamaoka S. Kitajima I. Saiki I. Sakurai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25177-25181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Together, although it is necessary to elucidate a molecular mechanism for how TAK1 controls the regulation of IRF3 phosphorylation, this is the first demonstration that Tax activates IRF3 in a TAK1-dependent manner. IRF4 was originally identified as a negative transcription factor and has been characterized to be highly expressed in lymphocytes from ATLL patients and HTLV-1-transformed T cells (28Sharma S. Mamane Y. Grandvaux N. Bartlett J. Petropoulos L. Lin R. Hiscott J. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2000; 16: 1613-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Imaizumi Y. Kohno T. Yamada Y.

Hiscott J. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3120-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recently, a clinical study demonstrated that IRF4 is a critical determinant of the resistance to antiviral combination therapy using IFN and zidovudine (AZT) in patients with ATLL (31Ramos J.C. Ruiz Jr., P. Ratner L. Reis I.M. Brites C. Pedroso C. Byrne Jr., G.E. Toomey N.L. Andela V. Harhaj E.W. Lossos I.S. Harrington Jr., W.J. Blood. 2007; 109: 3060-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); therefore, we investigated the role of IRF4 in IRF3-mediated gene expression. We confirmed IRF4 overexpression in all HTLV-1-transformed cells tested, even in Tax-negative cells (Fig. 6A). IRF4 protein expression was also up-regulated in these cells (Fig. 6B). In addition, in Tax-positive HuT-102 cells, IRF4 expression was not dependent on Tax (Fig. 6C). IRF4 knockdown strongly promoted the expressions of CXCL10 and IFIT1 in HuT-102 cells, indicating that IRF4 negatively controls IFN-regulated genes (Fig. 6D). In addition, although the expression level was very low, IFN-β mRNA was also up-regulated by IRF4 knockdown (Fig. 6D). These results were supported by a recent study, in which IRF4 negatively regulates the TLR signaling (9Negishi H. Ohba Y. Yanai H. Takaoka A. Honma K. Yui K. Matsuyama T. Taniguchi T. Honda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15989-15994Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In contrast, in Tax-negative ED40515(−) cells, IRF4 siRNA did not promote CXCL10 expression (Fig. 6E), probably because of no IRF3 activation in these cells (Fig. 4A). Similarly, the enhancing effect of IRF4 siRNA on CXCL10 expression was cancelled by stable knockdown of TAK1 in HuT-102 cells, although IRF4 mRNA expression and its down-regulation by siRNA were comparably detected (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, IRF3 and TBK1 knockdown also blocked the increase in CXCL10 gene expression by IRF4 siRNA (Fig. 7B).FIGURE 7Suppression of TAK1-TBK1-IRF3 pathway by IRF4. A, HuT-shTAK1 and HuT-shLuc cells were transfected with IRF4 and Luc siRNAs. At 60 h after transfection, the expressions of CXCL10 and IRF4 mRNA were examined by RT-PCR. B, HuT-102 cells were transfected with IRF4 and Luc siRNA in combination with IRF3 and TBK1 siRNA, and then CXCL10 mRNA expression was amplified by RT-PCR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These findings suggest that HTLV-1 manipulates two independent IFN-regulatory signals in Tax-positive T cells: the Tax-mediated activation signal by IRF3, and IRF4 which is overexpressed in a Tax-independent manner. Although Tax hijacks intracellular signaling events, HTLV-1 interferes with IRF3 antiviral responses by controlling the negative transcription factor IRF4. Additionally, Tax triggers an anti-IFN response by inhibiting binding of STAT2 to CBP/p300 (25Zhang J. Yamada O. Kawagishi K. Araki H. Yamaoka S. Hattori T. Shimotohno K. Virology. 2008; 379: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The most interesting question from this study is why Tax induces the IRF3 anti-viral pathway. We speculate that IRF3 plays other roles becoming advantageous to survival of HTLV-1 and its host T cells. Identification of common and individual target genes for IRF3 and IRF4 will provide information to answer this question about the IFN responses in HTLV-1-infected T cells. We thank Drs. M.

https://openalex.org/W1971828572,"Principal components analysis has been used for decades to summarize genetic variation across geographic regions and to infer population migration history. More recently, with the advent of genome-wide association studies of complex traits, it has become a commonly-used tool for detection and correction of confounding due to population structure. However, principal components are generally sensitive to outliers. Recently there has also been concern about its interpretation. Motivated from geometric learning, we describe a method based on spectral graph theory. Regarding each study subject as a node with suitably defined weights for its edges to close neighbors, one can form a weighted graph. We suggest using the spectrum of the associated graph Laplacian operator, namely, Laplacian eigenfunctions, to infer population structure. In simulations and real data on a ring species of birds, Laplacian eigenfunctions reveal more meaningful and less noisy structure of the underlying population, compared with principal components. The proposed approach is simple and computationally fast. It is expected to become a promising and basic method for population genetics and disease association studies."
https://openalex.org/W1974386814,"The Bcl-2 family regulates induction of apoptosis at the mitochondria. Essential to this regulation are the interactions between Bcl-2 family members, which are mediated by Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains. Vaccinia virus F1L is a unique inhibitor of apoptosis that lacks significant sequence similarity with the Bcl-2 family and does not contain obvious BH domains. Despite this, F1L inhibits cytochrome c release from mitochondria by preventing Bak and Bax activation. Although F1L constitutively interacts with Bak to prevent Bak activation, the precise mechanism of this interaction remains elusive. We have identified highly divergent BH domains in F1L that were verified by the recent crystal structure of F1L (Kvansakul, M., Yang, H., Fairlie, W. D., Czabotar, P. E., Fischer, S. F., Perugini, M. A., Huang, D. C., and Colman, P. M. (2008) Cell Death Differ. 15, 1564-1571). Here we show that F1L required these BH domains to interact with ectopically expressed and endogenous Bak. The interaction between F1L and Bak was conserved across species, and both F1L and the cellular antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 required the Bak BH3 domain for interaction. Moreover, F1L replaced Mcl-1 during infection, as the Bak x Mcl-1 complex was disrupted during vaccinia virus infection. In contrast to UV irradiation, vaccinia virus infection did not result in rapid degradation of Mcl-1, consistent with our observation that vaccinia virus did not initiate a DNA damage response. Additionally, Mcl-1 expression prevented Bak activation and apoptosis during infection with a proapoptotic vaccinia virus devoid of F1L. Our data suggest that F1L replaces the antiapoptotic activity of Mcl-1 during vaccinia virus infection by interacting with Bak using highly divergent BH domains."
https://openalex.org/W2094248446,"DNA word frequencies, normalized for genomic AT content, are remarkably stable within prokaryotic genomes and are therefore said to reflect a ""genomic signature."" The genomic signatures can be used to phylogenetically classify organisms from arbitrary sampled DNA. Genomic signatures can also be used to search for horizontally transferred DNA or DNA regions subjected to special selection forces. Thus, the stability of the genomic signature can be used as a measure of genomic homogeneity. The factors associated with the stability of the genomic signatures are not known, and this motivated us to investigate further. We analyzed the intra-genomic variance of genomic signatures based on AT content normalization (0(th) order Markov model) as well as genomic signatures normalized by smaller DNA words (1(st) and 2(nd) order Markov models) for 636 sequenced prokaryotic genomes. Regression models were fitted, with intra-genomic signature variance as the response variable, to a set of factors representing genomic properties such as genomic AT content, genome size, habitat, phylum, oxygen requirement, optimal growth temperature and oligonucleotide usage variance (OUV, a measure of oligonucleotide usage bias), measured as the variance between genomic tetranucleotide frequencies and Markov chain approximated tetranucleotide frequencies, as predictors.Regression analysis revealed that OUV was the most important factor (p<0.001) determining intra-genomic homogeneity as measured using genomic signatures. This means that the less random the oligonucleotide usage is in the sense of higher OUV, the more homogeneous the genome is in terms of the genomic signature. The other factors influencing variance in the genomic signature (p<0.001) were genomic AT content, phylum and oxygen requirement.Genomic homogeneity in prokaryotes is intimately linked to genomic GC content, oligonucleotide usage bias (OUV) and aerobiosis, while oligonucleotide usage bias (OUV) is associated with genomic GC content, aerobiosis and habitat."
https://openalex.org/W2094681837,"The Golgi-specific zinc finger protein GODZ (palmitoyl acyltransferase/DHHC-3) mediates the palmitoylation and post-translational modification of many protein substrates that regulate membrane-protein interactions. Here, we show that GODZ also mediates Ca(2+) transport in expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes. Two-electrode voltage-clamp, fluorescence, and (45)Ca(2+) isotopic uptake determinations demonstrated voltage- and concentration-dependent, saturable, and substrate-inhibitable Ca(2+) transport in oocytes expressing GODZ cRNA but not in oocytes injected with water alone. Moreover, we show that GODZ-mediated Ca(2+) transport is regulated by palmitoylation, as the palmitoyl acyltransferase inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate or alteration of the acyltransferase DHHC motif (GODZ-DHHS) diminished GODZ-mediated Ca(2+) transport by approximately 80%. The GODZ mutation V61R abolished Ca(2+) transport but did not affect palmitoyl acyltransferase activity. Coexpression of GODZ-V61R with GODZ-DHHS restored GODZ-DHHS-mediated Ca(2+) uptake to values observed with wild-type GODZ, excluding an endogenous effect of palmitoylation. Coexpression of an independent palmitoyl acyltransferase (HIP14) with the GODZ-DHHS mutant also rescued Ca(2+) transport. HIP14 did not mediate Ca(2+) transport when expressed alone. Immunocytochemistry studies showed that GODZ and HIP14 co-localized to the Golgi and the same post-Golgi vesicles, suggesting that heteropalmitoylation might play a physiological role in addition to a biochemical function. We conclude that GODZ encodes a Ca(2+) transport protein in addition to its ability to palmitoylate protein substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1987851007,"Background Cognitive experiences during the early stages of life play an important role in shaping the future behavior in mammals but also in insects, in which precocious learning can directly modify behaviors later in life depending on both the timing and the rearing environment. However, whether olfactory associative learning acquired early in the adult stage of insects affect memorizing of new learning events has not been studied yet. Methodology Groups of adult honeybee workers that experienced an odor paired with a sucrose solution 5 to 8 days or 9 to 12 days after emergence were previously exposed to (i) a rewarded experience through the offering of scented food, or (ii) a non-rewarded experience with a pure volatile compound in the rearing environment. Principal Findings Early rewarded experiences (either at 1–4 or 5–8 days of adult age) enhanced retention performance in 9–12-day-conditioned bees when they were tested at 17 days of age. The highest retention levels at this age, which could not be improved with prior rewarded experiences, were found for memories established at 5–8 days of adult age. Associative memories acquired at 9–12 days of age showed a weak effect on retention for some pure pre-exposed volatile compounds; whereas the sole exposure of an odor at any younger age did not promote long-term effects on learning performance. Conclusions The associative learning events that occurred a few days after adult emergence improved memorizing in middle-aged bees. In addition, both the timing and the nature of early sensory inputs interact to enhance retention of new learning events acquired later in life, an important matter in the social life of honeybees."

Non-parametric tests were used for statistical analyses.Placental and peripheral P. falciparum infections were not significantly associated with HIV-1 infection (OR: 1.4; 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.5-4.2; p = 0.50 and OR: 0.6; 95%CI: 0.3-1.4; p = 0.26, respectively). Conversely, placental P. falciparum parasitemia was significantly higher in the HIV-1 positive group (p = 0.04). We observed an increase of TNF-alpha mRNA median levels (p = 0.02) and a trend towards a decrease of IL-10 mRNA (p = 0.07) in placenta from HIV-1 positive women compared to the HIV negative ones leading to a median TNF-alpha/IL-10 mRNA ratio significantly higher among HIV-1 positive than among HIV-1 negative placenta (p = 0.004; 1.5 and 0.8, respectively). Significant decrease in median secreted cytokine levels were observed in placenta from HIV-1 positive women as compared to the HIV negative however these results are somewhat indicative since it appears that differences in cytokine levels (protein or mRNA) between HIV-1 positive and negative women depend greatly on P.falciparum infection. Within the HIV-1 positive group, TNF-alpha was the only cytokine significantly associated with clinical parameters linked with HIV-1 MTCT such as premature rupture of membranes, CD4 T-cell number, plasma viral load and delay of NVP intake before delivery.These results show that P. falciparum infection profoundly modifies the placenta cytokine environment and acts as a confounding factor, masking the impact of HIV-1 in co-infected women. This interplay between the two infections might have implications in the in utero MTCT of HIV-1 in areas where HIV-1 and P. falciparum co-circulate."

While MsDps1 has two oligomeric states, with one of them responsible for DNA binding, MsDps2 has only one DNA-binding oligomeric state. Both the proteins however, show iron-binding activity. The MsDps1 protein has been shown previously to be induced under conditions of starvation and osmotic stress and is regulated by the extra cellular sigma factors σH and σF. We show here, that the second Dps homologue in M. smegmatis, namely MsDps2, is purified in a DNA-bound form and exhibits nucleoid-like structures under the atomic force microscope. It appears that the N-terminal sequence of Dps2 plays a role in nucleoid formation. MsDps2, unlike MsDps1, does not show elevated expression in nutritionally starved or stationary phase conditions; rather its promoter is recognized by RNA polymerase containing σA or σB, under in vitro conditions. We propose that due to the nucleoid-condensing ability, the expression of MsDps2 is tightly regulated inside the cells."

https://openalex.org/W2025779416,"Background The allochimeric MHC class I molecule [α1h1/u]-RT1.Aa that contains donor-type (Wistar Furth, WF; RT1u) epitopes displayed on recipient-type (ACI, RT1a) administered in conjunction with sub-therapeutic dose of cyclosporine (CsA) induces indefinite survival of heterotopic cardiac allografts in rat model. In vascularized transplantation models, the spleen contributes to graft rejection by generating alloantigen reactive T cells. The immune response in allograft rejection involves a cascade of molecular events leading to the formation of immunological synapses between T cells and the antigen-presenting cells. Methodology/Principal Findings To elucidate the molecular pathways involved in the immunosuppressive function of allochimeric molecule we performed microarray and quantitative RTPCR analyses of gene expression profile of splenic T cells from untreated, CsA treated, and allochimeric molecule + subtherapeutic dose of CsA treated animals at day 1, 3 and 7 of post transplantation. Allochimeric molecule treatment caused down regulation of genes involved in actin filament polymerization (RhoA and Rac1), cell adhesion (Catna1, Vcam and CD9), vacuolar transport (RhoB, Cln8 and ATP6v1b2), and MAPK pathway (Spred1 and Dusp6) involved in tubulin cytoskeleton reorganization and interaction between actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. All these genes are involved in T cell polarity and motility, i.e., their ability to move, scan and to form functional immunological synapse with antigen presenting cells (APCs). Conclusions These results indicate that the immunosuppressive function of allochimeric molecule may depend on the impairment of T cells' movement and scanning ability, and possibly also the formation of immunological synapse. We believe that these novel findings may have important clinical implications for organ transplantation."

https://openalex.org/W2111699668,"Background Contrast discrimination for an image is usually harder if another image is superimposed on top. We asked whether such contrast masking may be enhanced or relieved depending on cues promoting integration of both images as a single pattern, versus segmentation into two independent components. Methodology & Principal Findings Contrast discrimination thresholds for a foveal test grating were sharply elevated in the presence of a perfectly overlapping orthogonally-oriented mask grating. However thresholds returned to the unmasked baseline when a surround grating was added, having the same orientation and phase of either the test or mask grating. Both such masking and ‘unmasking’ effects were much stronger for moving than static stimuli. Conclusions & Significance Our results suggest that common-fate motion reinforces the perception of a single coherent plaid pattern, while the surround helps to identify each component independently, thus peeling the plaid apart again. These results challenge current models of early vision, suggesting that higher-level surface organization influences contrast encoding, determining whether the contrast of a grating may be recovered independently from that of its mask."
