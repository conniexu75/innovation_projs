This behavioral dimorphism is correlated with the presence of morphological sex differences within the neural substrate that mediates this behavior, the song system. When a female chick is exposed to 17beta-estradiol her song system is subsequently masculinized. Either testosterone or 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone may then induce such a female to sing when an adult."
https://openalex.org/W2062429239,"A structural model is proposed for the polymeric units in silicate melts quenched at 1 atmosphere. The anionic units that have been identified by the use of Raman spectroscopy are SiO(4)(4-) monomers, Si(2)O(7)(6-) dimers, SiO(3)(2-) chains or rings, Si(2)O(5)(2-) sheets, and SiO(2) three-dimensional units. The coexisting anionic species are related to specific ranges of the ratio of nonbridging oxygens to tetrahedrally coordinated cations (NBO/Si). In melts with 2.0 < NBO/Si < approximately 4.0, the equilibrium is of the type [See equation in the PDF file]. In melts with NBO/Si approximately 1.0 to 2.0, the equilibrium anionic species are given by [See equation in the PDF file]. In alkali-silicate melts with NBO/Si <~ 1.3 and in aluminosilicate melts with NBO/T < 1.0, where T is (Si + Al), the anionic species in equilibrium are given by [See equation in the PDF file]. In multicomponent melts with compositions corresponding to those of the major igneous rocks, the anionic species are TO(2), T(2)O(5), T(2)O(6), and TO(4), and the coexisting polymeric units are determined by the second and third of these disproportionation reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2028089252,"Differences in the rare gas isotopic ratios, especially the ratios of helium-3 to helium-4 and of argon-40 to argon-36, in Hawaiian ultramafic nodules and phenocrysts in volcanic rocks indicate that the nodules and phenocrysts were derived from different sources. The isotopic ratios in ultramafic nodules are similar to those in oceanic tholeiites. The phenocrysts seem to have formed in equilibrium with source materials richer in primordial components than those of the oceanic tholeiites. Mixing between the sources is quite likely."
https://openalex.org/W2050848207,"The first reliable, securely dated full- and late-glacial pollen stratigraphy from Eastern Beringia forces the rejection of the widely held hypothesis of a steppetundra or grassland associated with extinct vertebrates and early humans. The arctic-alpine fossil flora and low pollen influx suggest a sparse tundra similar to modern herb fell-field vegetation."

A comparison of measurements made some 20 years ago with the present background concentration reveals the possibility of an increase of 9 percent per year. Since the aerosol particles are predominantly sulfuric acid droplets which form in the stratosphere from tropospheric sulfur-containing gases, such an increase may be related to man-made sulfur emissions."

https://openalex.org/W2059343564,"Close correlation has been observed between the serially tested plasma level of a glycolytic enzyme, lactic dehydrogenase, and the growth of several transplanted mouse tumors. The character of the lactic dehydrogenase curve determined by serial blood sampling of the animals during the development of such tumors is found to consist of five separate phases. The first three appear before any visible evidence of tumor growth. Inhibition or regression of tested tumors, induced by therapeutic compounds, was accurately reflected in a corresponding reduction of lactic dehydrogenase activity in the peripheral plasma of the host."

The results indicate that spaceborne imaging radar may be used to accurately measure ocean wavelength and direction, even in coastal areas and in the presence of a mixed ocean."

https://openalex.org/W2060438379,"Manganous 1,2-naphthoquinone-2-oxime protected tomato foliage in the field from damage apparently caused by excessive atmospheric ozone. The compound proved to be a very effective antiozonant. The similar cobaltous and manganous chelates of 8-quinolinol were also effective antiozonants. The materials were applied to cloth of the type used to make field tents for shade-grown tobacco. Tomato plants covered with cloth treated with cobaltous 8-quinolinolate were protected against otherwise damaging concentrations of ozone. These materials and methods may afford a useful way to reduce weather fleck of tobacco and other plant injuries caused by excessive atmospheric ozone."

The associated trees, shrubs, and herbs resemble the chaparral and conifer-oak woodland communities of the semiarid foothills and mountains of central and southeastern Arizona, and suggest a late Tertiary landscape and climate for central Arizona similar to that of today."

https://openalex.org/W1982133611,Paratylotropidia brunneri Scudder is the first insect known to possess a long-range mandibular sound signal. This signal probably evolved through a stage in which feeding noises were significant; it is believed to be a functional analog of other insect calling sounds.

https://openalex.org/W2003555404,"Geological studies in the western Atlantic indicate that sea level is now near its highest position since the Pleistocene, and that intertidal erosion at this level has been negligible. The evidence conflicts with the idea that many coral reefs were recently planed down from a higher stand of the sea."
