https://openalex.org/W2761536263,"Giga-voxel-resolution computational morphogenesis is used to optimize the internal structure of a full-scale aeroplane wing, yielding light-weight designs with more similarities to animal bone structures than to current aeroplane wing designs. Computational morphogenesis is used to design the best possible shapes and material distributions for the desired structural properties, such as high strength at minimal weight. In plants and animals, morphogenesis occurs naturally through slow genetic evolution. In engineering, a much faster iterative approach for optimum material distribution has been adopted, called topology optimization. So far, it has been used to calculate only small or simple structures owing to limited resolution. Niels Aage et al. have developed a morphogenesis tool that can be run on a supercomputer and can calculate two orders of magnitude more voxels (the three-dimensional equivalents of pixels) than was previously attainable. This makes it possible to design structures with unprecedented detail, yielding new insights into optimal material distribution. The authors calculate an optimized full aircraft wing structure with remarkable structural detail at several length scales, which displays similarities to naturally occurring bone structures such as those seen in bird beaks. The new tool could inspire surprising design approaches for a range of structures, including wind turbine blades, tower masts and bridges. In the design of industrial products ranging from hearing aids to automobiles and aeroplanes, material is distributed so as to maximize the performance and minimize the cost. Historically, human intuition and insight have driven the evolution of mechanical design, recently assisted by computer-aided design approaches. The computer-aided approach known as topology optimization enables unrestricted design freedom and shows great promise with regard to weight savings, but its applicability has so far been limited to the design of single components or simple structures, owing to the resolution limits of current optimization methods1,2. Here we report a computational morphogenesis tool, implemented on a supercomputer, that produces designs with giga-voxel resolution—more than two orders of magnitude higher than previously reported. Such resolution provides insights into the optimal distribution of material within a structure that were hitherto unachievable owing to the challenges of scaling up existing modelling and optimization frameworks. As an example, we apply the tool to the design of the internal structure of a full-scale aeroplane wing. The optimized full-wing design has unprecedented structural detail at length scales ranging from tens of metres to millimetres and, intriguingly, shows remarkable similarity to naturally occurring bone structures in, for example, bird beaks. We estimate that our optimized design corresponds to a reduction in mass of 2–5 per cent compared to currently used aeroplane wing designs, which translates into a reduction in fuel consumption of about 40–200 tonnes per year per aeroplane. Our morphogenesis process is generally applicable, not only to mechanical design, but also to flow systems3, antennas4, nano-optics5 and micro-systems6,7."

https://openalex.org/W2763018072,"Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) arise from the thermonuclear explosion of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. Though the uniformity of their light curves makes them powerful cosmological distance indicators, long-standing issues remain regarding their progenitors and explosion mechanisms. Recent detection of the early ultraviolet pulse of a peculiar subluminous SN Ia has been claimed as new evidence for the companion-ejecta interaction through the single-degenerate channel. Here, we report the discovery of a prominent but red optical flash at $\sim$ 0.5 days after the explosion of a SN Ia which shows hybrid features of different SN Ia sub-classes: a light curve typical of normal-brightness SNe Ia, but with strong titanium absorptions, commonly seen in the spectra of subluminous ones. We argue that the early flash of such a hybrid SN Ia is different from predictions of previously suggested scenarios such as the companion-ejecta interaction. Instead it can be naturally explained by a SN explosion triggered by a detonation of a thin helium shell either on a near-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf ($\gtrsim$ 1.3 M$_{\odot}$) with low-yield $^{56}$Ni or on a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf ($\sim$ 1.0 M$_{\odot}$) merging with a less massive white dwarf. This finding provides compelling evidence that one branch of the previously proposed explosion models, the helium-ignition scenario, does exist in nature, and such a scenario may account for explosions of white dwarfs in a wider mass range in contrast to what was previously supposed."

https://openalex.org/W2763807380,"Research paper recommenders emerged over the last decade to ease finding publications relating to researchers' area of interest. The challenge was not just to provide researchers with very rich publications at any time, any place and in any form but to also offer the right publication to the right researcher in the right way. Several approaches exist in handling paper recommender systems. However, these approaches assumed the availability of the whole contents of the recommending papers to be freely accessible, which is not always true due to factors such as copyright restrictions. This paper presents a collaborative approach for research paper recommender system. By leveraging the advantages of collaborative filtering approach, we utilize the publicly available contextual metadata to infer the hidden associations that exist between research papers in order to personalize recommendations. The novelty of our proposed approach is that it provides personalized recommendations regardless of the research field and regardless of the user's expertise. Using a publicly available dataset, our proposed approach has recorded a significant improvement over other baseline methods in measuring both the overall performance and the ability to return relevant and useful publications at the top of the recommendation list."

We introduce a novel active camera trap system enabling the reliable and efficient use of wildlife cameras for sampling small animals, particularly reptiles, amphibians, small mammals and large invertebrates. It surpasses the detection ability of commonly used passive infrared (PIR) cameras for this application and eliminates problems such as high rates of false triggers and high variability in detection rates among cameras and study locations. Our system, which employs a HALT trigger, is capable of coupling to digital PIR cameras and is designed for detecting small animals traversing small tunnels, narrow trails, small clearings and along walls or drift fencing."
https://openalex.org/W2763079597,"Brown bears are known to use rubbing behavior as a means of chemical communication, but the function of this signaling is unclear. One hypothesis that has gained support is that male bears rub to communicate dominance to other males. We tested the communication of dominance hypothesis in a low-density brown bear population in southeast British Columbia. We contrasted rubbing rates for male and female bears during and after the breeding season using ten years of DNA-mark-recapture data for 643 individuals. Here we demonstrate that male brown bears rub 60% more during the breeding than the non-breeding season, while female rubbing had no seasonal trends. Per capita rub rates by males were, on average, 2.7 times higher than females. Our results suggest that the function of rubbing in the Rocky Mountains may not only be to communicate dominance, but also to self-advertise for mate attraction. We propose that the role of chemical communication in this species may be density-dependent, where the need to self-advertise for mating is inversely related to population density and communicating for dominance increases with population density. We suggest that future endeavors to elucidate the function of rubbing should sample the behavior across a range of population densities using camera trap and genotypic data."
https://openalex.org/W2761298086,"Impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity, accompanied by enhanced glycolysis, is a key metabolic feature of cancer cells, but its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Previously, we reported that human hepatoma cells that harbor OXPHOS defects exhibit high tumor cell invasiveness via elevated claudin-1 (CLN1). In the present study, we show that OXPHOS-defective hepatoma cells (SNU354 and SNU423 cell lines) exhibit reduced expression of mitochondrial ribosomal protein L13 (MRPL13), a mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome) subunit, suggesting a ribosomal defect. Specific inhibition of mitoribosomal translation by doxycycline, chloramphenicol, or siRNA-mediated MRPL13 knockdown decreased mitochondrial protein expression, reduced oxygen consumption rate, and increased CLN1-mediated tumor cell invasiveness in SNU387 cells, which have active mitochondria. Interestingly, we also found that exogenous lactate treatment suppressed MRPL13 expression and oxygen consumption rate and induced CLN1 expression. A bioinformatic analysis of the open RNA-Seq database from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) cohort revealed a significant negative correlation between MRPL13 and CLN1 expression. Moreover, in patients with low MRPL13 expression, two oxidative metabolic indicators, pyruvate dehydrogenase B expression and the ratio of lactate dehydrogenase type B to type A, significantly and negatively correlated with CLN1 expression, indicating that the combination of elevated glycolysis and deficient MRPL13 activity was closely linked to CLN1-mediated tumor activity in LIHC. These results suggest that OXPHOS defects may be initiated and propagated by lactate-mediated mitoribosomal deficiencies and that these deficiencies are critically involved in LIHC development.

https://openalex.org/W2762164260,"Recent studies suggested that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with an increased risk of cardiac tachyarrhythmias (mainly atrial fibrillation) in patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to examine whether an association also exists between NAFLD and heart block. We have retrospectively evaluated a hospital-based cohort of 751 patients with type 2 diabetes discharged from our Division of Diabetes and Endocrinology during years 2007-2014. Standard electrocardiograms were performed on all patients. Diagnosis of NAFLD was based on ultrasonography, whereas the severity of advanced hepatic fibrosis was based on the fibrosis (FIB)-4 score and other non-invasive fibrosis markers. Overall, 524 (69.8%) patients had NAFLD and 202 (26.9%) had heart block (defined as at least one block among first-degree atrio-ventricular block, second-degree block, third-degree block, left bundle branch block, right bundle branch block, left anterior hemi-block or left posterior hemi-block) on electrocardiograms. Patients with NAFLD had a remarkably higher prevalence of any persistent heart block than those without NAFLD (31.3% vs. 16.7%, p<0.001); this prevalence was particularly increased among those with higher FIB-4 score. NAFLD was associated with a threefold increased risk of prevalent heart block (adjusted-odds ratio 3.04, 95% CI 1.81-5.10), independently of age, sex, hypertension, prior ischemic heart disease, hemoglobin A1c, microvascular complication status, use of medications and other potentially confounding factors. In conclusion, this is the largest cross-sectional study to show that NAFLD and its severity are independently associated with an increased risk of prevalent heart block in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2764118178,"Introduction In South Africa, the rate of HIV in the sex worker (SW) population is exceedingly high, but critical gaps exist in our understanding of SWs and the factors that make them vulnerable to HIV. This study aimed to estimate HIV prevalence among female sex workers (FSWs) in Soweto, South Africa, and to describe their sexual behavior and other factors associated with HIV infection. Methods A cross-sectional, respondent-driven sampling (RDS) recruitment methodology was used to enroll 508 FSWs based in Soweto. Data were collected using a survey instrument, followed by two HIV rapid tests. Raw and RDS adjusted data were analyzed using a chi-squared test of association and multivariate logistic regression to show factors associated with HIV infection. Findings HIV prevalence among FSWs was 53.6% (95% CI 47.5–59.9). FSWs were almost exclusively based in taverns (85.6%) and hostels (52.0%). Less than a quarter (24.4%) were under 25 years of age. Non-partner violence was reported by 55.5%, 59.6% of whom were HIV-infected. Advancing age, incomplete secondary schooling, migrancy and multiple clients increased the likelihood of HIV acquisition: >30 years of age was associated with a 4.9 times (95% CI 2.6–9.3) increased likelihood of HIV; incomplete secondary schooling almost tripled the likelihood (AOR 2.8, 95% CI 1.6–5.0); being born outside of the Gauteng province increased the likelihood of HIV 2.3 times (95% CI 1.3–4.0); and having more than five clients per day almost doubled the likelihood (AOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.2). Conclusion Our findings highlight the extreme vulnerability of FSWs to HIV. Advancing age, limited education and multiple clients were risk factors associated with HIV, strongly driven by a combination of structural, biological and behavioral determinants. Evidence suggests that interventions need to be carefully tailored to the varying profiles of SW populations across South Africa. Soweto could be considered a microcosm of South Africa in terms of the epidemic of violence and HIV experienced by the SW population, which is influenced by factors often beyond an individual level of control. While describing a hitherto largely undocumented population of FSWs, our findings confirm the urgent need to scale up innovative HIV prevention and treatment programs for this population."
https://openalex.org/W2761505404,"People aging with HIV show variable health trajectories. Our objective was to identify longitudinal predictors of frailty severity and mortality among a group aging with HIV.Exploratory analyses employing a multistate transition model, with data from the prospective Modena HIV Metabolic Clinic Cohort Study, based in Northern Italy, begun in 2004. Participants were followed over four years from their first available visit. We included all 963 participants (mean age 46.8±7.1; 29% female; 89% undetectable HIV viral load; median current CD4 count 549, IQR 405-720; nadir CD4 count 180, 81-280) with four-year data. Frailty was quantified using a 31-item frailty index. Outcomes were frailty index score or mortality at four-year follow-up. Candidate predictor variables were baseline frailty index score, demographic (age, sex), HIV-disease related (undetectable HIV viral load, current CD4+ T-cell count, nadir CD4 count, duration of HIV infection, and duration of antiretroviral therapy [ARV] exposure), and behavioral factors (smoking, injection drug use (IDU), and hepatitis C virus co-infection).Four-year mortality was 3.0% (n = 29). In multivariable analyses, independent predictors of frailty index at follow-up were baseline frailty index (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.05-1.07), female sex (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87-0.98), nadir CD4 cell count (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93-0.99), duration of HIV infection (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.12), duration of ARV exposure (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.14), and smoking pack-years (1.03, 1.01-1.05). Independent predictors of mortality were baseline frailty index (OR 1.19, 1.02-1.38), current CD4 count (0.34, 0.20-0.60), and IDU (2.89, 1.30-6.42).Demographic, HIV-disease related, and social and behavioral factors appear to confer risk for changes in frailty severity and mortality among people aging with HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2761601692,"Motility of the apicomplexan malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is enabled by a multiprotein glideosome complex, whose core is the class XIV myosin motor, PfMyoA, and a divergent Plasmodium actin (PfAct1). Parasite motility is necessary for host-cell invasion and virulence, but studying its molecular basis has been hampered by unavailability of sufficient amounts of PfMyoA. Here, we expressed milligram quantities of functional full-length PfMyoA with the baculovirus/Sf9 cell expression system, which required a UCS (UNC-45/CRO1/She4p) family myosin chaperone from Plasmodium spp. In addition to the known light chain myosin tail interacting protein (MTIP), we identified an essential light chain (PfELC) that co-purified with PfMyoA isolated from parasite lysates. The speed at which PfMyoA moved actin was fastest with both light chains bound, consistent with the light chain–binding domain acting as a lever arm to amplify nucleotide-dependent motions in the motor domain. Surprisingly, PfELC binding to the heavy chain required that MTIP also be bound to the heavy chain, unlike MTIP that bound the heavy chain independently of PfELC. Neither the presence of calcium nor deletion of the MTIP N-terminal extension changed the speed of actin movement. Of note, PfMyoA moved filaments formed from Sf9 cell–expressed PfAct1 at the same speed as skeletal muscle actin. Duty ratio estimates suggested that as few as nine motors can power actin movement at maximal speed, a feature that may be necessitated by the dynamic nature of Plasmodium actin filaments in the parasite. In summary, we have reconstituted the essential core of the glideosome, enabling drug targeting of both of its core components to inhibit parasite invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2764284951,"Entomopathogenic fungi are known for their ability to carry out glycosylation of flavonoids, which usually results in the improvement of their stability and bioavailability. In this study we used a newly isolated strain of the entomopathogenic filamentous fungus Isaria fumosorosea KCH J2 as a biocatalyst. Our aim was to evaluate its ability to carry out the biotransformation of flavonoids and to obtain new flavonoid derivatives. The fungus was isolated from a spider's carcass and molecularly identified using analysis of the ITS1-ITS2 rDNA sequence. As a result of biotransformation of 6-methylflavone two new products were obtained: 6-methylflavone 8-O-β-D-(4""-O-methyl)-glucopyranoside and 6-methylflavone 4'-O-β-D-(4""-O-methyl)-glucopyranoside. Chemical structures of the products were determined based on spectroscopic methods (1H NMR, 13C NMR, COSY, HMBC, HSQC). Our research allowed us to discover a new species of filamentous fungus capable of carrying out glycosylation reactions and proved that I. fumosorosea KCH J2 is an effective biocatalyst for glycosylation of flavonoid compounds. For the first time we describe biotransformations of 6-methylflavone and the attachment of the sugar unit to the flavonoid substrate having no hydroxyl group. The possibility of using flavonoid aglycones is often limited by their low bioavailability due to poor solubility in water. The incorporation of a sugar unit improves the physical properties of tested compounds and thus increases the chance of using them as pharmaceuticals."
https://openalex.org/W2762054475,"Alarm fatigue is a well-recognized patient safety concern in intensive care settings. Decreased nurse responsiveness and slow response times to alarms are the potentially dangerous consequences of alarm fatigue. The aim of this study was to determine the factors that modulate nurse responsiveness to critical patient monitor and ventilator alarms in the context of a private room neonatal intensive care setting.The study design comprised of both a questionnaire and video monitoring of nurse-responsiveness to critical alarms. The Likert scale questionnaire, comprising of 50 questions across thematic clusters (critical alarms, yellow alarms, perception, design, nursing action, and context) was administered to 56 nurses (90% response rate). Nearly 6000 critical alarms were recorded from 10 infants in approximately 2400 hours of video monitoring. Logistic regression was used to identify patient and alarm-level factors that modulate nurse-responsiveness to critical alarms, with a response being defined as a nurse entering the patient's room within the 90s of the alarm being generated.Based on the questionnaire, the majority of nurses found critical alarms to be clinically relevant even though the alarms did not always mandate clinical action. Based on video observations, for a median of 34% (IQR, 20-52) of critical alarms, the nurse was already present in the room. For the remaining alarms, the response rate within 90s was 26%. The median response time was 55s (IQR, 37-70s). Desaturation alarms were the most prevalent and accounted for more than 50% of all alarms. The odds of responding to bradycardia alarms, compared to desaturation alarms, were 1.47 (95% CI = 1.21-1.78; <0.001) while that of responding to a ventilator alarm was lower at 0.35 (95% CI = 0.27-0.46; p <0.001). For every 20s increase in the duration of an alarm, the odds of responding to the alarm (within 90s) increased to 1.15 (95% CI = 1.1-1.2; p <0.001). The random effect per infant improved the fit of the model to the data with the response times being slower for infants suffering from chronic illnesses while being faster for infants who were clinically unstable.Even though nurses respond to only a fraction of all critical alarms, they consider the vast majority of critical and yellow alarms as useful and relevant. When notified of a critical alarm, they seek waveform information and employ heuristics in determining whether or not to respond to the alarm.Amongst other factors, the category and duration of critical alarms along with the clinical status of the patient determine nurse-responsiveness to alarms."
https://openalex.org/W2761768194,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic blood disorder that is often associated with acute and chronic cerebrovascular complications, including strokes and impaired cognition. Using functional resting state magnetic resonance images, we performed whole-brain analysis of the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF), to detect areas of spontaneous blood oxygenation level dependent signal across brain regions. We compared the ALFF of 20 SCD patients to that observed in 19 healthy, age and ethnicity-matched, control subjects. Significant differences were found in several brain regions, including the insula, precuneus, anterior cingulate cortex and medial superior frontal gyrus. To identify the ALFF differences resulting from anemia alone, we also compared the ALFF of SCD patients to that observed in 12 patients having comparable hemoglobin levels but lacking sickle hemoglobin. Increased ALFF in the orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex and decreased ALFF in the frontal pole, cerebellum and medial superior frontal gyrus persisted after accounting for the effect of anemia. The presence of white matter hyperintensities was associated with depressed frontal and medial superior frontal gyri activity in the SCD subjects. Decreased ALFF in the frontal lobe was correlated with decreased verbal fluency and cognitive flexibility. These findings may lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of SCD."
https://openalex.org/W2761128699,"African-American men with prostate cancer typically develop more aggressive tumors than men from other racial/ethnic groups, resulting in a disproportionately high mortality from this malignancy. This study evaluated differences in the expression of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), a known family of oncoproteins, in blood-derived exosomal vesicles (EV) between African-American and European-American men with prostate cancer. The ExoQuick™ method was used to isolate EV from both plasma and sera of African-American (n = 41) and European-American (n = 31) men with prostate cancer, as well as from controls with no cancer diagnosis (n = 10). EV preparations were quantified by acetylcholinesterase activity assays, and assessed for their IAP content by Western blotting and densitometric analysis. Circulating levels of the IAP Survivin were evaluated by ELISA. We detected a significant increase in the levels of circulating Survivin in prostate cancer patients compared to controls (P<0.01), with the highest levels in African-American patients (P<0.01). African-American patients with prostate cancer also contained significantly higher amounts of EVs in their plasma (P<0.01) and sera (P<0.05) than European-American patients. In addition, EVs from African-American patients with prostate cancer contained significantly higher amounts of the IAPs Survivin (P<0.05), XIAP (P<0.001), and cIAP-2 (P<0.01) than EVs from European-American patients. There was no significant correlation between expression of IAPs and clinicopathological parameters in the two patient groups. Increased expression of IAPs in EVs from African-American patients with prostate cancer may influence tumor aggressiveness and contribute to the mortality disparity observed in this patient population. EVs could serve as reservoirs of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets that may have clinical utility in reducing prostate cancer health disparities."
https://openalex.org/W2763735495,"The increase of anthropogenic pressures on the marine environment together with the necessity of a sustainable management of marine living resources have underlined the need to map and model coastal environments, particularly for the purposes of spatial planning and for the implementation of integrated ecosystem-based management approach. The present study compares outputs of a process-driven benthic habitat sensitivity (PDS) model to the structure, composition and distribution of benthic invertebrates in the Eastern English Channel and southern part of the North Sea. Trawl disturbance indicators (TDI) computed from species biological traits and benthic community composition were produced from samples collected with a bottom trawl. The TDI was found to be highly correlated to the PDS further validating the latter's purpose to identify natural process-driven pattern of sensitivity. PDS was found to reflect an environmental potential that may no longer be fully observable in the field and difference with in situ biological observations could be partially explained by the spatial distribution of fishery pressure on the seafloor. The management implication of these findings are discussed and we suggest that, used in conjunction with TDI approaches, PDS may help monitor management effort by evaluating the difference between the current state and the presumed optimal environmental status of marine benthic habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2761325905,"Background Different pulmonary hypertension (PH) mechanisms are associated with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Methods and results We conducted a retrospective study of all suspected cases of PH (echocardiographically estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure [sPAP] ≥ 40 mmHg) in patients with definite HHT recorded in the French National Reference Centre for HHT database. When right heart catheterization (RHC) was performed, PH cases were confirmed and classified among the PH groups according to the European guidelines. Among 2,598 patients in the database, 110 (4.2%) had suspected PH. Forty-seven of these 110 patients had RHC: 38/47 (81%) had a confirmed diagnosis of PH. The majority of these had isolated post-capillary PH (n = 20). We identified for the first time other haemodynamic profiles: pre-capillary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) cases (n = 3) with slightly raised pulmonary vascular resistances (PVR), and combined post- and pre-capillary PH cases (n = 4). Compared to controls, survival probability was lower in patients with PAH. Conclusion This study revealed the diversity of PH mechanisms in HHT. The description of combined post- and pre-capillary PH with/or without high cardiac output (CO) suggests either a continuum between the pre- and post-capillary haemodynamic profiles or a different course in response to high CO."
https://openalex.org/W2761886916,"One of the major biological functions of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) is the clearance of shed photoreceptor outer segments (POS) through a multistep process resembling phagocytosis. RPE phagocytosis helps maintain the viability of photoreceptors that otherwise could succumb to the high metabolic flux and photo-oxidative stress associated with visual processing. The regulatory mechanisms underlying phagocytosis in the RPE are not fully understood, although dysfunction of this process contributes to the pathogenesis of multiple human retinal degenerative disorders, including age-related macular degeneration. Here, we present an integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic analysis of phagocytosing RPE cells, utilizing three different experimental models: the human-derived RPE-like cell line ARPE-19, cultured murine primary RPE cells, and RPE samples from live mice. Our combined results indicated that early stages of phagocytosis in the RPE are mainly characterized by pronounced changes in the protein phosphorylation level. Global phosphoprotein enrichment analysis revealed involvement of PI3K/Akt, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and MEK/ERK pathways in the regulation of RPE phagocytosis, confirmed by immunoblot analyses and in vitro phagocytosis assays. Most strikingly, phagocytosis of POS by cultured RPE cells was almost completely blocked by pharmacological inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt. Our findings, along with those of previous studies, indicate that these phosphorylation events allow the RPE to integrate multiple signals instigated by shed POS at different stages of the phagocytic process."

https://openalex.org/W2761969370,"Plant population density (PPD) and nitrogen (N) application rate (NAR) are two controllable factors in cotton production. We conducted field experiments to investigate the effects of PPD, NAR and their interaction (PPD × NAR) on yield, N uptake and N use efficiency (NUE) of cotton using a split-plot design in the North China Plain during 2013 and 2014. The main plots were PPDs (plants m-2) of 3.00 (low), 5.25 (medium) and 7.50 (high) and the subplots were NARs of 0 (N-free), 112.5 (low), 225.0 (moderate) and 337.5 (high). During both 2013 and 2014, biological yield and N uptake of cotton increased significantly, but harvesting index decreased significantly with NAR and PPD increasing. With NAR increasing, internal nitrogen use efficiency(NUE) decreased significantly under three PPDs and agronomical NUE, physiologilal NUE, nitrogen recovery efficiency(NRE) and partial factor productivity from applied nitrogen (PFPN) also decreased significantly under high PPD between two years. Lint yield increment varied during different PPDs and years, but NAR enhancement showed less function under higher PPD than lower PPD in general. Taken together, moderate NAR under medium PPD combined higher lint yield with higher agronomic NUE, physiological NUE, and NRE, while low NAR with high PPD would achieve a comparable yield with superior NRE and PFPN and high NAR under high PPD and medium PPD produced higher biological yield but lower harvest index, lint yield and NUE compared to moderate NAR with medium PPD. Our overall results indicated that, in this region, increasing PPD and decreasing NAR properly would enhance both lint yield and NUE of cotton."
https://openalex.org/W2763029345,"In agriculture, heavy metal contamination of soil interferes with processes associated with plant growth, development and productivity. Here, we describe oxidative and redox changes, and deleterious injury within cotyledons and seedlings caused by exposure of germinating (Phaseolus vulgaris L. var. soisson nain hâtif) seeds to copper (Cu). Cu induced a marked delay in seedling growth, and was associated with biochemical disturbances in terms of intracellular oxidative status, redox regulation and energy metabolism. In response to these alterations, modulation of activities of antioxidant proteins (thioredoxin and glutathione reductase, peroxiredoxin) occurred, thus preventing oxidative damage. In addition, oxidative modification of proteins was detected in both cotyledons and seedlings by one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis. These modified proteins may play roles in redox buffering. The changes in activities of redox proteins underline their fundamental roles in controlling redox homeostasis. However, observed differential redox responses in cotyledon and seedling tissues showed a major capacity of the seedlings' redox systems to protect the reduced status of protein thiols, thus suggesting quantitatively greater antioxidant protection of proteins in seedlings compared to cotyledon.

Their use and manufacture were restricted or banned in many countries in the 1970–1980s, however, they still persist in the antroposphere, the environment and in biota worldwide today. Conventions like the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution encourage or bind the member parties to annually submit emission inventories of regulated air pollutants. Unfortunately, several member states have not yet reported PCB emissions. The identification and quantification of stocks and emissions sources is, however, an important precondition to handle and remove the remaining reservoirs of PCBs and, thus, to be able to reduce emissions and subsequently environmental exposure. Here, we estimate past, present, and future emissions of PCBs to air in Switzerland and provide emission factors for all relevant emission categories. Switzerland hereby represents a typical developed industrial country, and most of the assumptions and parameters presented here can be used to calculate PCB emission also for other countries. PCB emissions to air are calculated using a dynamic mass flow and emissions model for Switzerland, which is run for the years 1930–2100. The results point out the importance of the use of PCBs in open applications, which have largely been previously overlooked. Additionally, we show that PCBs will persist in applications during the coming decades with ongoing emissions. Especially the use of PCBs in open applications will cause Swiss emissions to remain above 100 kg PCB per year, even after the year 2030. Our developed model is available in Excel/VBA and can be downloaded with this article."
https://openalex.org/W2762067889,"This study proposes a new liver segmentation method based on a sparse a priori statistical shape model (SP-SSM). First, mark points are selected in the liver a priori model and the original image. Then, the a priori shape and its mark points are used to obtain a dictionary for the liver boundary information. Second, the sparse coefficient is calculated based on the correspondence between mark points in the original image and those in the a priori model, and then the sparse statistical model is established by combining the sparse coefficients and the dictionary. Finally, the intensity energy and boundary energy models are built based on the intensity information and the specific boundary information of the original image. Then, the sparse matching constraint model is established based on the sparse coding theory. These models jointly drive the iterative deformation of the sparse statistical model to approximate and accurately extract the liver boundaries. This method can solve the problems of deformation model initialization and a priori method accuracy using the sparse dictionary. The SP-SSM can achieve a mean overlap error of 4.8% and a mean volume difference of 1.8%, whereas the average symmetric surface distance and the root mean square symmetric surface distance can reach 0.8 mm and 1.4 mm, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2762452478,"Galectin-1 is an important immunoregulatory factor and can mediate the host–pathogen interaction via binding glycans on the surface of various viruses. We previously reported that avian respiratory viruses, including lentogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV), can induce up-regulation of chicken galectin (CG)-1B in the primary target organ. In this study, we investigated whether CG-1B participated in the infectious process of NDV in chickens. We demonstrated that velogenic NDV induced up-regulation of CG-1B in target organs. We also found that CG-1B directly bound to NDV virions and inhibited their hemagglutination activity in vitro. We confirmed that CG-1B interacted with NDV hemagglutinin–neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein, in which the specific G4 N-glycans significantly contributed to the interaction between CG-1B and HN glycoprotein. The presence of extracellular CG-1B, rather than the internalization process, inhibited adsorption of NDV. The interaction between intracellular CG-1B and NDV HN glycoproteins inhibited cell-surface expression of HN glycoprotein and reduced the titer of progeny virus in NDV-infected DF-1 cells. Significantly, the replication of parental and HN glycosylation mutant viruses in CG-1B knockdown and overexpression cells demonstrated that the replication of NDV was correlated with the expression of CG-1B in a specific glycan-dependent manner. Collectively, our results indicate that CG-1B has anti-NDV activity by binding to N-glycans on HN glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W2760952044,"Background More than ten million Egyptians are infected with HCV. Every one of them is going to infect about three to four persons every year. Treating those patients is a matter of national security. A dramatic improvement in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection treatment was achieved in the last five years. A new era of direct-acting antivirals is now dawning in Egypt. Objective(s) We share in this report our clinical experience in treating chronic HCV Egyptian patients with Sofosbuvir based regimens to evaluate its safety and efficacy on real life practical ground. Methods A total of 205 chronic HCV patients (195 naive and 15 experienced) were enrolled in the study. Patient were treated with Sofosbuvir+Ribavirin 24 weeks as standard of care. Two interferon eligible patients were treated with PEG-INF+ Sofosbuvir+Ribavirin for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with sustained virologic response at 24 weeks after cessation of therapy. Results The overall response rate was 97.1%. Sustained virological response rate did not differ among treatment-naive patients and patients with previous history of IFN-based therapy. Portal hypertension, prediabetes, and lack of early virologic response were predictors of non response. No clinically significant treatment-emergent adverse effects were noted. No treatment discontinuation was encountered. Conclusion In the real-life setting, Sofosbuvir based regimens for 24 weeks has established an efficacious and well tolerated treatment in naïve and experienced patients with chronic HCV genotype 4 infection; although shorter treatment durations may be possible. However, patient follow up should extent to at least 6 months post-treatment and verifying viral load on yearly basis is warranted to track any late relapse."
https://openalex.org/W2760980144,"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is the major etiologic agent of hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). The high rate of HUS emphasizes the urgency for the implementation of primary prevention strategies to reduce its public health impact. Argentina shows the highest rate of HUS worldwide, being E. coli O157 the predominant STEC-associated HUS serogroup (>70%), followed by E. coli O145 (>9%). To specifically detect these serogroups we aimed at developing highly specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the O-polysaccharide (O-PS) section of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the dominant STEC-associated HUS serogroups in Argentina. The development of hybridomas secreting mAbs against O157 or O145 was carried out through a combined immunization strategy, involving adjuvated-bacterial immunizations followed by immunizations with recombinant O-PS-protein conjugates. We selected hybridoma clones that specifically recognized the engineered O-PS-protein conjugates of O157 or O145 serogroups. Indirect ELISA of heat-killed bacteria showed specific binding to O157 or O145 serogroups, respectively, while no cross-reactivity with other epidemiological important STEC strains, Brucella abortus, Salmonella group N or Yersinia enterocolitica O9 was observed. Western blot analysis showed specific recognition of the sought O-PS section of the LPS by all mAbs. Finally, the ability of the developed mAbs to bind the surface of whole bacteria cells was confirmed by flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and agglutination assays, indicating that these mAbs present an exceptional degree of specificity and relative affinity in the detection and identification of E. coli O157 and O145 serogroups. These mAbs may be of significant value for clinical diagnosis and food quality control applications. Thus, engineered O-PS specific moieties contained in the recombinant glycoconjugates used for combined immunization and hybridoma selection are an invaluable resource for the development of highly specific mAbs."
https://openalex.org/W2763166317,"Fe deficiency may increase Cd accumulation in peanuts. However, the mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In the present study, two contrasting peanut cultivars, Luhua 8 (low seed-Cd cultivar) and Zhenghong 3 (high seed-Cd cultivar) were used to investigate the effect of Fe deficiency on the uptake and accumulation of cadmium (Cd) by hydroponic experiments. Under Fe-sufficient conditions, compared with Luhua 8, Zhenghong 3 had higher specific root length (SRL) and proportion of fine roots with a lower Km for Cd and showed slightly higher expression of AhIRT1 and AhNRAMP1 in the roots. These traits may be responsible for high capacity for Cd accumulation in Zhenghong 3. Under Fe deficiency, the increase of Cd accumulation was much larger in Zhenghong 3 than in Luhua 8. Kinetics studies revealed that the Vmax for Cd influx was 1.56-fold higher in Fe-deficient plants than in Fe-sufficient plants for Zhenghong 3, versus 0.48-fold higher for Luhua 8. Moreover, the increased expression levels of AhIRT1 and AhNRAMP1 induced by Fe deficiency was higher in Zhenghong 3 than in Luhua 8. Yeast complementation assays suggested that the AhIRT1 and AhNRAMP1 may function as transporters involved in Cd uptake. In conclusion, the different Cd accumulation between the two cultivars under Fe deficiency may be correlated with Vmax value for Cd uptake and the expression levels of AhIRT1 and AhNRAMP1 in the roots."
https://openalex.org/W2761002809,"Novel biomarkers for prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis and prognosis are necessary to improve the accuracy of current ones employed in clinic. We performed a retrospective study between the association of several polymorphisms in the main genes involved in the synthesis and metabolism of sex hormones and PCa risk and aggressiveness. A total of 311 Caucasian men (155 controls and 156 patients) were genotyped for 9 SNPs in AR, CYP17A1, LHCGR, ESR1 and ESR2 genes. Diagnostic PSA serum levels, Gleason score, tumor stage, D´Amico risk and data of clinical progression were obtained for patients at the moment of the diagnosis and after 54 months of follow-up. Chi-squared test were used for comparisons between clinical variables groups, logistic regression for clinical variables associations between SNPs; and Kaplan-Meier for the association between SNPs and time to biochemical progression. We found 5 variants (CYP17A1) rs743572, rs6162, rs6163; (LHCGR) rs2293275 and (ESR2) rs1256049 that were statistically significant according to clinical variables (PSA, D´Amico risk and T stage) on a case-case analysis. Moreover, the presence of A and G alleles in rs743572 and rs6162 respectively, increase the risk of higher PSA levels (>10 ng/μl). With respect to D´Amico risk rs743572 (AG-GG), rs6162 (AG-AA) and rs6163 (AC-AA) were associated with an increased risk; and last, AC and AA genotypes for rs6163 were associated with a shorter biochemical recurrence free survival (BRFS) in patients with radical prostatectomy. In multigene analysis, several variants in SNPs rs2293275, rs6152, rs1062577, rs6162, rs6163, rs1256049 and rs1004467 were described to be associated with a more aggressiveness in patients. However, none of the selected SNPs show significant values between patients and controls. In conclusion, this study identified inherited variants in genes CYP17A1, LHCGR and ESR2 related to more aggressiveness and/or a poor progression of the disease. According to this study, new promise PCa biomarkers for clinical management could be included in these previous SNPs."
https://openalex.org/W4231922876,"In heterologous protein productions by P. pastoris, methanol induction is generally initiated when cell concentration reaches very high density. The alternative strategy by initiating methanol induction at lower cells concentration was also reported to be effective in easing DO control, reducing toxic by-metabolites accumulation and increasing targeted proteins titers. However, the methanol/energy regulation mechanisms are seldom reported. We theoretically analyzed the methanol/energy metabolisms in protein expression process with the strategies of initiating induction at higher or lower cells concentrations, using monellin production as a prototype. When initiating induction at lower cells concentration and controlling induction temperature at 30°C, monellin concentration reached the highest levels of 2.62~2.71 g/L, which was 2.5~4.9 fold of those obtained with the strategy of initiating induction at higher cells concentration. With the desired induction strategy, 1) carbon metabolism ratio directing into the precursors synthesis route for monellin production reached the highest level of 65%, carbon metabolism ratios towards to precursors synthesis and ATP regeneration routes were regulated at relatively balanced levels; 2) monellin synthesis was completely cell growth associated, with the largest associated coefficient and higher specific growth rate; 3) theoretical NADH (energy) utilization efficiency η was the highest, and η stayed high levels (≥0.8) during most period (89%) within induction phase to supply sufficient energy in supporting monellin synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2761806917,"Have tropical rain forest landscapes changed directionally through recent decades? To answer this question requires tracking forest structure and dynamics through time and across within-forest environmental heterogeneity. While the impacts of major environmental gradients in soil nutrients, climate and topography on lowland tropical rain forest (TRF) structure and function have been extensively analyzed, the effects of the shorter environmental gradients typical of mesoscale TRF landscapes remain poorly understood. To evaluate multi-decadal performance of an old-growth TRF at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, we established 18 0.5-ha annually-censused forest inventory plots in a stratified-random design across major landscape edaphic gradients. Over the 17-year study period, there were moderate differences in stand dynamics and structure across these gradients but no detectable difference in woody productivity. We found large effects on forest structure and dynamics from the mega-Niño event at the outset of the study, with subdecadal recovery and subsequent stabilization. To extend the timeline to >40 years, we combined our findings with those from earlier studies at this site. While there were annual to multiannual variations in the structure and dynamics, particularly in relation to local disturbances and the mega-Niño event, at the longer temporal scale and broader spatial scale this landscape was remarkably stable. This stability contrasts notably with a current hypothesis of increasing biomass and dynamics of TRF, which we term the Bigger and Faster Hypothesis (B&FHo). We consider possible reasons for the contradiction and conclude that it is currently not possible to independently assess the vast majority of previously published B&FHo evidence due to restricted data access."

SeV C protein also blocks the signal transduction of IFN-α/β by inhibiting the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, although the mechanism for the inhibition is unclear. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the mechanism of inhibition of the IFN signal transduction via STAT1 and STAT2.

We generated a linker-less recombinant protein possessing a STAT1ND:STAT2ND heterodimeric structure via an artificial disulfide bond. Analytical size-exclusion chromatography and surface plasmon resonance revealed that one molecule of Y3 can associate with a linker-less recombinant protein. We propose that one molecule of C protein associates with the STAT1:STAT2 heterodimer, inducing a conformational change to an antiparallel form, which is easily dephosphorylated.

RE was defined as the presence of at least Los Angeles classification grade A mucosal break. CT scan was used to determine the coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores. CAC progression was defined as an increase in the CAC score on a subsequent CT scan.RE was present in 984 (12.0%) participants. RE at baseline was associated with CAC progression (odds ratio [OR], 1.253; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.088-1.444; P = 0.002), and this association persisted after adjusting the model for age, sex, smoking status, and alcohol consumption (OR, 1.175; 95% CI, 1.001-1.378; P = 0.048). This association disappeared when the model was further adjusted for body mass index, diastolic blood pressure, the presence of hypertension, glycated hemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides (OR, 1.088; 95% CI, 0.924-1.281; P = 0.311) which were selected using a stepwise selection procedure from several metabolic variables.Our results suggest that the presence of RE is closely associated with CHD, even though RE is not a direct risk factor for CHD. Metabolic factors may play roles in CAC progression in individuals with RE."

We present the draft genome sequence of its causative agent Diplocarpon rosae as a working tool to generate molecular markers and to analyze functional and structural characteristics of this fungus. Results The isolate DortE4 was sequenced with 191x coverage of different read types which were assembled into 2457 scaffolds. By evidence supported genome annotation with the MAKER pipeline 14,004 gene models were predicted and transcriptomic data indicated that 88.5% of them are expressed during the early stages of infection. Analyses of k-mer distributions resulted in unexpectedly large genome size estimations between 72.5 and 91.4 Mb, which cannot be attributed to its repeat structure and content of transposable elements alone, factors explaining such differences in other fungal genomes. In contrast, different lines of evidences demonstrate that a huge proportion (approximately 80%) of genes are duplicated, which might indicate a whole genome duplication event. By PCR-RFLP analysis of six paralogous gene pairs of BUSCO orthologs, which are expected to be single copy genes, we could show experimentally that the duplication is not due to technical error and that not all isolates tested possess all of the paralogs. Conclusions The presented genome sequence is still a fragmented draft but contains almost the complete gene space. Therefore, it provides a useful working tool to study the interaction of D. rosae with the host and the influence of a genome duplication outside of the model yeast in the background of a phytopathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2761070936,"Fas Apoptosis Inhibitory Molecule (FAIM) is an evolutionarily highly conserved death receptor antagonist, widely expressed and known to participate in physiological and pathological processes. Two FAIM transcript variants have been characterized to date, namely FAIM short (FAIM-S) and FAIM long (FAIM-L). FAIM-S is ubiquitously expressed and serves as an anti-apoptotic protein in the immune system. Furthermore, in neurons, this isoform promotes NGF-induced neurite outgrowth through NF-кB and ERK signaling. In contrast FAIM-L is found only in neurons, where it exerts anti-apoptotic activity against several stimuli. In addition to these two variants, in silico studies point to the existence of two additional isoforms, neither of which have been characterized to date. In this regard, here we confirm the presence of these two additional FAIM isoforms in human fetal brain, fetal and adult testes, and placenta tissues. We named them FAIM-S_2a and FAIM-L_2a since they have the same sequence as FAIM-S and FAIM-L, but include exon 2a. PCR and western blot revealed that FAIM-S_2a shows ubiquitous expression in all the tissues and cellular models tested, while FAIM-L_2a is expressed exclusively in tissues of the nervous system. In addition, we found that, when overexpressed in non-neuronal cells, the splicing factor nSR100 induces the expression of the neuronal isoforms, thus identifying it as responsible for the generation of FAIM-L and FAIM-L_2a. Functionally, FAIM-S_2a and FAIM-L_2a increased neurite outgrowth in response to NGF stimulation in a neuronal model. This observation thus, supports the notion that these two isoforms are involved in neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that, in contrast to FAIM-S and FAIM-L, FAIM-S_2a and FAIM-L_2a are able to localize to the nucleus, where they may have additional functions. In summary, here we report on two novel FAIM isoforms that may have relevant roles in the physiology and pathology of the nervous system."

Therefore, we evaluated the antihyperglycemic and antioxidant effects of an extract of V. rufa on the pancreata of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Animals received one of the following treatments daily by oral gavage: water (diabetic-control), V. rufa extract (diabetic-V. rufa), or glibenclamide (diabetic-GBD). Total antioxidant capacity; levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, reduced glutathione, and sulfhydryls; and superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities were measured in the pancreas. Biochemical analysis of serum total cholesterol and fractions, triglycerides, creatinine, urea, acid uric, ALP, γ-GT, AST, and ALT was performed, and pancreatic β-cells positive for insulin were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Rats treated with extract exhibited a decrease in fasting blood glucose compared with levels in diabetic control rats. GPx activity and sulfhydryl levels were significantly lower in diabetic-V. rufa rats compared with those of diabetic-control rats. V. rufa extract acted to normalize the biochemical alterations found in diabetic rats (diabetic-controls), as demonstrated by increases in urea, HDL, ALP, AST, and ALT. Reduction in blood glucose was independent of an increase in insulin. The V. rufa extract was found to be composed of free sugars (inositol, galactose, glucose, mannose, sucrose, arabinose, and ribose) as the main metabolites. Thus, aqueous extract of the stem bark of V. rufa is capable of reducing blood glucose, resulting in an antioxidant effect on the pancreatic tissue of STZ-diabetic rats."
https://openalex.org/W2763949131,"A two-dimensional numerical study of flow across rows of identical square cylinders arranged in staggered fashion is carried out. This study will unreveal complex flow physics depending upon the Reynolds number (Re) and gap spacing (g) between the cylinders. The combined effect of Reynolds number and gap spacing on the flow physics around staggered rows of cylinders are numerically studied for 20 ≤ Re ≤ 140 and 1 ≤ g ≤ 6. We use the lattice Boltzmann method for numerical computations. It is found that with increase in gap spacing between the cylinders the critical Reynolds number for the onset of vortex shedding also increases. We observed a strong effect of Reynolds number at g = 2 and 4. Secondary cylinder interaction frequency disappears for large Reynolds number at g = 6 and 5 and the flow around cylinders are fully dominated by the primary vortex shedding frequency. This ensures that at large gap spacing with an increase in the Reynolds number the wakes interaction between and behind the cylinders is weaken. Furthermore, it also ensures that the wake interaction behind the cylinders is strongly influenced by the jets in the gap spacing between the cylinders. We also found that g = 2 is the critical gap spacing for flow across rows of staggered square cylinders for the considered range of Reynolds number. Depending on the Reynolds number we observed; synchronous, quasi-periodic-I, quasi-periodic-II, and chaotic flow patterns. In synchronous flow pattern, an in-phase and anti-phase characteristics of consecutive cylinders has been observed. The important physical parameters are also analyzed and discussed in detail."

It has also been found to possess a curious loss-of-function mutation (FMO2*1/FMO2*2) that demonstrates a distinctive differentiation in expression, function and ethno-geographic distribution. However, despite evidences of ethnic-specific genetic associations in the inflammatory profile of TB, no studies were done to investigate whether these patterns of variations correlate with evidences for the involvement of FMO2 in antimicrobial immune responses and ethnic differences in the distribution of FMO2 polymorphisms except for some pharmacogenetic data that suggest a potentially deleterious role for the functional variant (FMO2*1). This genetic epidemiological study was designed to investigate whether there is an association between FMO2 polymorphisms and TB, an ancient malady that remains a modern global health concern, in a sub-Saharan Africa setting where there is not only a relatively high co-prevalence of the disease and the ancestral FMO2*1 variant but also where both Mycobcaterium and Homo sapiens are considered to have originated and co-evolved. Blood samples and TB related clinical data were collected from ascertained TB cases and unrelated household controls (n = 292) from 3 different ethnic groups in Ethiopia. Latent Mtb infection was determined using Quantiferon to develop reliable TB progression phenotypes. We sequenced exonic regions of FMO2.We identified for the first time an association between FMO2 and TB both at the SNP and haplotype level. Two novel SNPs achieved a study-wide significance [chr1:171181877(A), p = 3.15E-07, OR = 4.644 and chr1:171165749(T), p = 3.32E-06, OR = 6.825] while multiple SNPs (22) showed nominal signals. The pattern of association suggested a protective effect of FMO2 against both active and latent TB with distinct genetic variants underlying the TB-progression pathway. The results were robust for population stratification. Haplotype-based tests confirmed the SNP-based results with a single haplotype bearing the ancestral-and-functional FMO2*1 ""C"" allele (""AGCTCTACAATCCCCTCGTTGCGC"") explaining the overall association (haplotype-specific-p = 0.000103). Strikingly, not only was FMO2*1 nominally associated with reduced risk to ""Active TB"" (p = 0.0118, OR = 0.496) but it also does not co-segregate with the 5'-3' flanking top high-TB-risk alleles. The study provides an evidence for the existence of an evolutionary adaptation to an ancient disease based on an ancestral genetic variant acting in a haplotypic framework in Ethiopian populations."
https://openalex.org/W2763237019,"This paper aims to optimize a desirable fare structure for the public transit service along a bus-subway corridor with the consideration of those factors related to equity in trip, including travel distance and comfort level. The travel distance factor is represented by the distance-based fare strategy, which is an existing differential strategy. The comfort level one is considered in the area-based fare strategy which is a new differential strategy defined in this paper. Both factors are referred to by the combined fare strategy which is composed of distance-based and area-based fare strategies. The flat fare strategy is applied to determine a reference level of social welfare and obtain the general passenger flow along transit lines, which is used to divide areas or zones along the corridor. This problem is formulated as a bi-level program, of which the upper level maximizes the social welfare and the lower level capturing traveler choice behavior is a variable-demand stochastic user equilibrium assignment model. A genetic algorithm is applied to solve the bi-level program while the method of successive averages is adopted to solve the lower-level model. A series of numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate the performance of the models and solution methods. Numerical results indicate that all three differential fare strategies play a better role in enhancing the social welfare than the flat fare strategy and that the fare structure under the combined fare strategy generates the highest social welfare and the largest resulting passenger demand, which implies that the more equity factors a differential fare strategy involves the more desirable fare structure the strategy has."

(2) Are these mutations pre-existing? (3) What is the relative fitness of cells with/without the mutation? We addressed these questions in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We conducted an exhaustive review of published data to establish a median doubling time for CRCs and stained a cohort of CRCs to document mitotic indices. We analyzed published data and our own data to calculate rates of growth (g) and regression (d, decay) of tumors in patients with CRC correlating these results with the detection of circulating MT-KRAS DNA. Additionally we estimated mathematically the caloric burden of such tumors using data on mitotic and apoptotic indices. We conclude outgrowth of cells harboring intrinsic or acquired MT-KRAS cannot explain resistance to anti-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) antibodies. Rates of tumor growth with panitumumab are unaffected by presence/absence of MT-KRAS. While MT-KRAS cells may be resistant to anti-EGFR antibodies, WT-KRAS cells also rapidly bypass this blockade suggesting inherent resistance mechanisms are responsible and a neutral evolution model is most appropriate. Using the above clinical data on tumor doubling times and mitotic and apoptotic indices we estimated the caloric intake required to support tumor growth and suggest it may explain in part cancer-associated cachexia."
