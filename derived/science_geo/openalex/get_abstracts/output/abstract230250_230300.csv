https://openalex.org/W2007095775,"A wide variety of in vivo manipulations influence neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. It is not known, however, if adult neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) can intrinsically sense excitatory neural activity and thereby implement a direct coupling between excitation and neurogenesis. Moreover, the theoretical significance of activity-dependent neurogenesis in hippocampal-type memory processing networks has not been explored. Here we demonstrate that excitatory stimuli act directly on adult hippocampal NPCs to favor neuron production. The excitation is sensed via Cav1.2/1.3 (L-type) Ca2+ channels and NMDA receptors on the proliferating precursors. Excitation through this pathway acts to inhibit expression of the glial fate genes Hes1 and Id2 and increase expression of NeuroD, a positive regulator of neuronal differentiation. These activity-sensing properties of the adult NPCs, when applied as an “excitation-neurogenesis coupling rule” within a Hebbian neural network, predict significant advantages for both the temporary storage and the clearance of memories."

However, a mechanism for this linkage has not been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that agonist stimulation of co-expressed D1 and D2 receptors resulted in an increase of intracellular calcium levels via a signaling pathway not activated by either receptor alone or when only one of the co-expressed receptors was activated by a selective agonist. Calcium signaling by D1-D2 receptor co-activation was abolished following treatment with a phospholipase C inhibitor but not with pertussis toxin or inhibitors of protein kinase A or protein kinase C, indicating coupling to the Gq pathway. We also show, by co-immunoprecipitation from rat brain and from cells co-expressing the receptors, that D1 and D2 receptors are part of the same heteromeric protein complex and, by immunohistochemistry, that these receptors are co-expressed and co-localized within neurons of human and rat brain. This demonstration that D1 and D2 receptors have a novel cellular function when co-activated in the same cell represents a significant step toward elucidating the mechanism of the functional link observed between these two receptors in brain.

The dopamine D1 receptor has been shown to signal via Gs and Golf proteins to stimulate adenylyl cyclase (1Zhuang X. Belluscio L. Hen R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar), and there have been reports of calcium signaling by D1 receptor-mediated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis by phospholipase C (PLC), 1The abbreviations used are: PLC, phospholipase C; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; HA, hemagglutinin; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; PTX, pertussis toxin.1The abbreviations used are: PLC, phospholipase C; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; HA, hemagglutinin; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; PTX, pertussis toxin. presumably through Gq coupling. Although PLC activity was not detected in studies on the D1 receptor expressed in COS7 cells (2Dearry A. Gingrich J.A. Falardeau P. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Bates M.D. Caron M.G. Nature. 1990; 347: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) or in Chinese hamster ovary and baby hamster kidney cells (3Pedersen U.B. Norby B. Jensen A.A. Schiodt M. Hansen A. Suhr-Jessen P. Scheideler M. Thastrup O. Andersen P.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 267: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), it has been shown that activation of the D1 receptor in brain tissue (4Undie A.S. Friedman E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 253: 987-992PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pacheco M. Jope R. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or in Xenopus oocytes injected with mRNA taken from striatum (6Mahan L.C. Burch R.M. Monsma Jr., F.J. Sibley D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2196-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) resulted in phosphatidylinositol turnover. This discrepancy suggests the involvement of a factor in D1 receptor-mediated PLC activity that is present in native tissues but absent in heterologous expression systems. An examination of the above studies where PLC activation was observed indicates that, although D1 receptor-selective antagonists blocked phosphatidylinositol turnover demonstrating the involvement of the D1 receptor, the amount of agonist used to elicit the response was greater than 100 μm, a concentration at which even selective ligands may bind other receptors. For example, SKF 81297, a highly D1-selective agonist, has a Ki for the D1 receptor of ∼1 nm but has a Ki for the D2 receptor of ∼900 nm (7Neumeyer J.L. Kula N.S. Bergman J. Baldessarini R.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 474: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This analysis suggests the possibility that the D1 agonist-mediated PLC stimulation by high concentrations of drugs observed in physiological systems may have resulted from the coincident activation of another receptor. There are considerable data indicating that the dopamine D1 and D2 receptors are functionally linked. For example, behavioral studies have shown that co-stimulation of the D1 receptor is essential for D2 agonists to produce maximal locomotor stimulation (8Dreher J.K. Jackson D.M. Brain Res. 1989; 487: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and that activation of both D1 and D2 receptors was required to augment the acute effects of cocaine action (9Kita K. Shiratani T. Takenouchi K. Fukuzako H. Takigawa M. Eur. Neuropsychopharmacol. 1999; 9: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Biochemical and electrophysiological evidence has also supported D1-D2 receptor synergism. Combined administration of specific D1 and D2 agonists potentiated immediate early gene expression (10Svenningsson P. Fredholm B.B. Bloch B. Le Moine C. Neuroscience. 2000; 98: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 11Gerfen C.R. Keefe K.A. Gauda E.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 8167-8176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, long term depression of synaptic transmission after dopamine depletion could be restored by dopamine or co-administration of specific D1 and D2 agonists but not by either selective agonist alone (12Calabresi P. Maj R. Mercuri N.B. Bernardi G. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 142: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism for the D1-D2 receptor interaction in these studies showing functional linkage is not clearly understood, there is evidence that an interaction between the receptors occurring within the same cell may be involved in some instances. For example, synergistic potentiation of the D2 receptor-mediated enhancement of arachidonic acid release by co-administration of D1-selective and D2-selective agonists in cells expressing both receptors has been observed (13Piomelli D. Pilon C. Giros B. Sokoloff P. Martres M.P. Schwartz J.C. Nature. 1991; 353: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that D1 subclass and D2 subclass receptors are co-expressed in neurons of the rat striatum (14Aizman O. Brismar H. Uhlen P. Zettergren E. Levey A.I. Forssberg H. Greengard P. Aperia A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that there may be a direct D1-D2 receptor association. Therefore, we postulated that dopaminergic PLC-mediated calcium signaling results from the co-activation of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors and the formation of a novel signaling unit represents the molecular basis for the functional interaction between these receptors. In investigating this hypothesis, we demonstrated that co-activation of co-expressed D1 and D2 receptors resulted in a PLC-mediated increase of intracellular calcium levels, a signaling pathway not activated when either one of the receptors was singly activated. Further, we also found evidence that D1 and D2 receptors associate within neurons and thereby potentially form a novel signaling complex. Cell Culture and Receptor Expression—All cell culture and transfection reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. COS7 and HEK293T cells were maintained as monolayer cultures at 37 °C in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Transient expression was performed using LipofectAMINE™ with DNA encoding human D1 receptor or the long isoform of the human dopamine D2 receptor that had been inserted into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). For immunoprecipitation experiments, HA and FLAG epitope tags were introduced after the initiation methionine of the D1 and D2 receptors, respectively, by PCR. Stable cell lines co-expressing the N terminus HA epitope-tagged D1 receptor and N terminus FLAG epitope-tagged human D2 receptor were created in HEK293TSA cells utilizing the pBudCE 4.1 vector (Invitrogen). Briefly, the D1 receptor cDNA was inserted into the EF1α multicloning site and the D2 receptor cDNA into the cytomegalovirus site. Antibiotic-resistant clones (selected with 200 μg/ml zeocin) of each transfection were isolated and tested for expression of corresponding receptors using saturation binding analysis. Measurement of Calcium Signal—Calcium mobilization assays were carried out using a FLEXstation multiwell plate fluorometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Stably transfected cells were seeded in black microtiter plates at a density of ∼105 cells/well and grown for 24 h. The cells were then loaded with 2 μm Fluo-4AM indicator dye (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in growth medium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES and 2.5 mm probenecid for 1 h and subsequently washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution without sodium bicarbonate and phenol red (Invitrogen). Base-line fluorescence values were measured for 15 s, and changes in fluorescence corresponding to alterations in intracellular calcium levels upon the addition of agonists thereafter were also recorded. Fluorescence values were collected at 3-s intervals for 150 s. For calculation of dose-response curves, the peak fluorescence values for each agonist concentration were determined and analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). In signaling pathway inhibition studies, cells were treated with 10 μm H89 (Calbiochem), 10 μm U73122 (Sigma), 1 μm wortmannin (Calbiochem), or 500 nm bisindolamide I (Calbiochem) for 1 h or with 0.125–1 μg/ml pertussis toxin (Sigma) for 18 h prior to the calcium measurements. Adenylyl Cyclase Activity—Adenylyl cyclase assays were conducted essentially as described previously (15Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3367) Google Scholar). The assay mix contained 0.02 ml of membrane suspension (10–25 μg of protein), 0.012 mm ATP, 0.1 mm cAMP, 0.053 mm GTP, 2.7 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 units of pyruvate kinase, 1 unit of myokinase, and 0.13 μCi of [33P]ATP in a final volume of 0.05 ml. For the inhibition experiments, 1 μm forskolin was included in the assay mix. The mixture was incubated with 10–3 to 10–12m SKF 81297 or quinpirole for 20 min, and enzyme activities were determined. Data were analyzed by computer-fitted nonlinear least-squares regression. Generation of Striatal Cultures—Neuronal cultures derived from the rodent striatum were generated using standard protocols. Briefly, striatal tissue was dissected from newborn rats (P1) and washed with calcium- and magnesium-free HEPES-buffered saline. The tissue was then incubated in a solution consisting of 0.25% trypsin and 0.5% DNase I for 20 min at 37 °C, followed by three washes in calcium-free HEPES-buffered saline with 12 mm magnesium sulfate. Cells were dissociated by trituration in a solution containing calcium-free HEPES-buffered saline, 12 mm magnesium sulfate, and 0.5% DNase I and then centrifuged. This was followed by resuspension in plating medium (Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with 2 mm glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum). Cells were plated on poly-l-lysine and laminin-coated 12-mm coverslips in 24-well plates at a density of ∼105 cells/coverslip. The following day, the plating medium was replaced with serum-free Neurobasal A medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with glutamine and B27 supplement (Invitrogen). Half the medium was replaced with fresh medium every 2–3 days. Immunocytochemical analysis of neurons was performed after 7–10 days in vitro. Fluorescence Immunohistochemistry of Brain Tissue—Human brain tissue was obtained from the Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders at the Department of Pediatrics, University of Maryland. Brain tissue from male Sprague-Dawley rats was also examined. Immunocytochemical procedures followed the indirect (secondary antibody-labeled) fluorescent technique described previously (16Lanca A.J. Neuroscience. 1994; 58: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The primary antibody for the D1 receptor was obtained from Sigma (catalog no. D-187), and the anti-D2 receptor antibody was acquired from Chemicon (Temecula, CA; catalog no. AB5084P). Secondary antibodies to visualize D1 and D2 receptors were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) (Molecular Probes), respectively. Confocal laser microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 system. Primary antibody specificity was tested using immunofluorescence microscopy of HEK 293T cells individually expressing each of the five dopamine receptor subtypes. Secondary antibody specificity was tested by control experiments in which no primary antibody was used. Immunocytochemistry of Cultured Neurons—Neurons were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 37 °C, washed again in phosphate-buffered saline, and then blocked for 2 h at room temperature in 10% goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Primary antibodies were added to each well in a 1:10 dilution of the blocking solution, and cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The next day, cells were washed and incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Following another series of washes, the coverslips were mounted on slides. The primary antibodies used in the staining were mouse monoclonal anti-D1 receptor (Chemicon catalog no. MAB5290) and rabbit anti-D2 receptor (Chemicon catalog no. AB5084P). Demonstration of Dopamine Receptor Antibody Specificity—Expression vector constructs encoding N-terminal c-Myc epitope-tagged human D3 dopamine receptor or encoding N-terminal HA epitope-tagged human D5 dopamine receptor were generated via PCR and insertion into pcDNA3 vector. A FLAG epitope-tagged human D4.4 dopamine receptor cDNA construct was generously provided by Dr. Hubert Van Tol (University of Toronto and the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Canada). HEK 293T cells were singly transfected with one of these constructs or with an expression vector encoding either the HA-tagged D1 receptor or the FLAG-tagged D2 receptor described earlier. The cells were fixed on glass coverslips in a manner similar to the one outlined above for cultured neurons. The receptors expressed in these cells were then probed by immunohistochemistry using the D1 or D2 receptor antibodies from Sigma (catalog no. D-187) and Chemicon (catalog no. AB5084P), respectively, and using an antibody corresponding to the epitope tag of the receptor. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation from HEK293T cells was performed as described previously (17George S.R. Fan T. Xie Z. Tse R. Tam V. Varghese G. O'Dowd B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26128-26135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), except the 3F10 anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) and 9E10 anti-c-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies were used for detection of the HA and c-Myc epitope, respectively. For immunoprecipitation from brain, striatal tissue was dissected from adult female Sprague-Dawley rats, and the procedure was carried out using a protocol described previously (18Babcock G.J. Farzan M. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3378-3385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Striatal membranes (500 μg) were solubilized and incubated with 5 μg of rabbit anti-rat D1 (Chemicon catalog no. AB1765P) or rabbit anti-rat D2 (Chemicon catalog no. AB5084P). Eluted protein was resolved by electrophoresis and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for Western blot analysis. Immunoblots were probed using a monoclonal D1 receptor antibody (Sigma catalog no. D-187). Co-activation of D1 and D2 Receptors Elevates Intracellular Calcium—We investigated whether the co-activation of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors resulted in a calcium signal. When cells co-expressing D1 and D2 receptors were stimulated by concurrent administration of equal concentrations of SKF 81297, a D1-selective agonist, and the D2-selective agonist quinpirole, a significant increase in intracellular calcium levels was observed (Fig. 1, A and B). Calcium mobilization was initially detected ∼2–5 s following agonist application, and the signal peaked within 30 s of the initial exposure to agonist (Fig. 1A). This maximal response was dose-dependent, requiring a 65.4 ± 12.9 nm concentration of each of the selective agonists to generate 50% of the maximal response (Fig. 1B). Treatment of the cells co-expressing the D1 and D2 receptors with either SKF 81297 or quinpirole individually did not increase intracellular calcium levels (Fig. 1B). No significant change in intracellular calcium levels could be observed in cells expressing only the D1 receptor that were stimulated with SKF 81297 or quinpirole or with both agonists concurrently (Fig. 1C). Similarly, there was no apparent calcium signal induced by SKF 81297, quinpirole, or the co-administration of both drugs in cells expressing only the D2 receptor (Fig. 1D). For comparison of the temporal characteristics of the calcium signal, activation of P2Y purinergic receptors was compared with that of the D1 and D2 receptors. HEK 293 cells have been shown to endogenously express G protein-coupled P2Y1 and P2Y2 purinergic receptors that stimulate PLC via Gq coupling when activated (19Schachter J.B. Sromek S.M. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the rate of calcium signal propagation is distinct for these two receptors, since the P2Y2 receptor-mediated signal occurs at a faster rate than the signal mediated by P2Y1 receptors (20Gallagher C.J. Salter M.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6728-6739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The agonist-induced increase in intracellular calcium-dependent fluorescence by the D1 and D2 receptor co-activation was temporally similar to that detected for Gq-coupled P2Y1 purinergic receptors activated by ATP (Fig. 1E). To confirm the requirement for concurrent activation of both D1 and D2 receptors in order to evoke calcium signal in cells expressing both D1 and D2 receptors, cells co-expressing D1 and D2 receptors were treated with either SCH 23390, a D1-selective antagonist, alone, or with eticlopride, a D2-selective antagonist, alone. Notably, the dual agonist-induced calcium signal was attenuated by the addition of SCH 23390 or by the addition of eticlopride (Fig. 1F). We hypothesized that dopamine treatment would elicit calcium increase in a manner similar to that arising by concurrent administration of SKF 81297 and quinpirole. No change in intracellular calcium levels was generated by dopamine in cells expressing only D1 or D2 dopamine receptors; however, when cells co-expressing D1 and D2 receptors were incubated with dopamine, an increase in intracellular calcium levels was seen (Fig. 2A). Again, the agonist-induced intracellular calcium increase could be blocked by the addition of SCH 23390 or eticlopride (Fig. 2B). In order to examine whether coupling to the adenylyl cyclase signaling pathway was affected by co-expression of D1 and D2 receptors, we examined cells co-expressing D1 and D2 receptors stimulated with SKF 81297 or with quinpirole (Fig. 3). The ability of the D1 receptor to stimulate adenylyl cyclase and of the D2 receptor to inhibit adenylyl cyclase was unaffected. There was no statistically significant difference in the maximum stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and the EC50 between the D1-D2 receptor-expressing cells and cells expressing only the D1 receptor. The same was true for the maximum inhibition of adenylyl cylcase and the EC50 between the D1-D2 receptor-expressing cells and cells expressing only the D2 receptor. These observations suggest that cells expressing both receptors may be capable of evoking three distinct dopamine-mediated signals simultaneously. Signal Transduction Pathway for D1-D2 Receptor Co-activation—In order to determine the mechanism of the calcium signal generation, we attempted to block key components of several signal transduction pathways while co-stimulating the receptors with both D1- and D2-selective agonists. Gs protein activation by the D1 receptor has been implicated in calcium signaling via protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated mechanisms (21Lin C.W. Miller T.R. Witte D.G. Bianchi B.R. Stashko M. Manelli A.M. Frail D.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 131-139PubMed Google Scholar, 22Liu Y.F. Civelli O. Zhou Q.Y. Albert P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1815-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Surmeier D.J. Bargas J. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 385-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Therefore, cells expressing D1 and D2 receptors were treated with H89, an inhibitor of PKA, and co-activated by D1 and D2 receptor agonists. There was no effect of H89 on the increase in intracellular calcium levels, suggesting that co-activated D1 and D2 receptor-mediated calcium signaling was not dependent on PKA (Fig. 4A). We then examined whether simultaneously activated D1 and D2 receptors increase intracellular calcium levels via a PLC-dependent pathway. Cells were treated with U73122, a PLC inhibitor. Notably, the increase in intracellular calcium levels by D1 and D2 receptor co-activation was markedly attenuated (>90%) after treatment with U73122 (Fig. 4A). U73122 also inhibited the calcium signal mediated by the endogenous, Gq-linked P2Y receptors (Fig. 4B), indicating that the inhibitor was blocking PLC. These results suggest that, when co-activated, D1 and D2 receptors may couple to Gq and signal through an inositol phosphate pathway to cause the release of intracellular calcium. G protein-coupled receptor stimulation of PLC may also occur via a protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated mechanism (24Yu P.Y. Eisner G.M. Yamaguchi I. Mouradian M.M. Felder R.A. Jose P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19503-19508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is evidence that lipid products of phosphoinositide 3-kinase action may generate a PLC-mediated calcium signal (25Rameh L.E. Rhee S.G. Spokes K. Kazlauskas A. Cantley L.C. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23750-23757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether PKC or phosphoinositide 3-kinase played a role in generating the calcium signal evoked by co-activated D1 and D2 receptors. When cells co-expressing D1 and D2 receptors were treated with bisindolamide I, a PKC inhibitor, and co-stimulated with D1 and D2 agonists, no attenuation of calcium signal was observed (Fig. 4A), suggesting that PLC was not stimulated by the actions of PKC. Similarly, when we examined the effects of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, on the D1-D2 receptor-mediated calcium signal, no significant changes were detected, suggesting no role for phosphoinositide 3-kinase in the novel signal generated by D1-D2 receptor coactivation (Fig. 4A). Although the Gαi/o subunits, the G proteins traditionally associated with D2 receptor signal transduction, have not been directly implicated in increases of intracellular calcium levels, the pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive signaling pathways have been linked to the activation of calcium signals. In such pathways, Gβγ dimers of PTX-sensitive G proteins have been shown to stimulate PLC directly (reviewed in Ref. 26Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar) or by modulating the Gq pathway, which in turn activates PLC (27Charles A.C. Mostovskaya N. Asas K. Evans C.J. Dankovich M.L. Hales T.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We investigated whether the co-activation of D1 and D2 receptors resulted in calcium signaling via a PTX-sensitive pathway. Treatment of cells co-expressing the D1 and D2 receptors with PTX resulted in a partial reduction (∼25–35%) in the maximum calcium stimulation caused by co-administration of SKF 81297 and quinpirole (Fig. 4, A and C). This effect did not appear to be dependent on the concentration of PTX, since the level of inhibition was virtually identical for all doses of PTX used. Notably, we have shown that 0.125 μg/ml PTX completely attenuates D2-mediated adenylyl cyclase inhibition, 2G. Varghese, B. F. O'Dowd, and S. R. George, unpublished observation. but concentrations of PTX up to 1 μg/ml did not completely block D1-D2 receptor-mediated calcium signal. In our positive control involving endogenous Gq-linked P2Y receptors, P2Y receptor-mediated calcium signal in HEK 293 cells was also partially blocked (∼25–30%) by PTX (Fig. 4C). These observations suggest that PTX may diminish the Gq-mediated calcium signal by co-activated D1-D2 receptors in a nonspecific manner but that the Gi/o pathway is not directly involved in the generation of the signal. Pharmacological Characterization of Co-expressed D1 and D2 Receptors—In order to determine whether the co-expression of D1 and D2 receptors resulted in a change in the conformation of the binding pocket of either receptor, ligand binding studies were performed. Competition of selective radiolabeled antagonist binding by dopamine or selective agonists indicated no significant change in binding affinity when D1 and D2 dopamine receptors were co-expressed (data not shown). In saturation binding studies, there was no change in the affinity (Kd) of the antagonists [3H]SCH 23390 or [3H]raclopride for the D1 and D2 receptors, respectively, upon co-expression. The Bmax and Kd values for [3H]SCH 23390 binding were 2797 ± 14 fmol/mg protein and 0.59 ± 0.02 nm for the cells stably expressing the D1 receptor alone and were 2071 ± 60 fmol/mg protein and 0.59 ± 0.02 nm for cells stably expressing both D1 and D2 receptors. The Bmax and Kd values for [3H]raclopride binding were 1105.5 ± 27.5 fmol/mg protein and 0.97 ± 0.084 nm for D2 receptor-expressing cells and 2449 ± 90.5 fmol/mg, and 0.675 ± 0.155 nm for cells stably expressing D1 and D2 receptors. These results suggest that co-expression did not affect the ligand binding pocket of the D1 or the D2 receptors. D1 and D2 Receptors Are Colocalized in Neurons—In order to determine whether there was a physiological basis for the novel response by D1 and D2 receptor co-activation, we examined whether these two receptors were co-expressed and co-localized within the same neurons. The expression of D1 and D2 receptors within neurons in brain tissues and cultured neurons was analyzed. D1-like and D2-like receptors have been shown to be co-localized in neurons of the rodent striatum (14Aizman O. Brismar H. Uhlen P. Zettergren E. Levey A.I. Forssberg H. Greengard P. Aperia A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar); however, there has been some controversy as to whether the D1 and D2 receptor subtypes are co-expressed in the same cell (14Aizman O. Brismar H. Uhlen P. Zettergren E. Levey A.I. Forssberg H. Greengard P. Aperia A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 28LaHoste G.J. Henry B.L. Marshall J.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6666-6671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using antibodies that were specific for the D1 and D2 receptors, we substantiated the subtype selectivity and performed immunohistochemical analysis of human and rat brain. In the caudate nucleus, prominent immunolabel was observed for both D1 and D2 receptors in cell bodies of individual medium spiny neurons (Fig. 5A). Distinct puncta corresponding to immunolabel for both receptors could be observed, which overlapped significantly in cells expressing both D1 and D2 receptors. In the rat frontal cortex (Fig. 5B), pyramidal cells were shown to co-express both D1 and D2 receptors, whereas interneurons appearing to only express D2 receptors were observed. Within cortical pyramidal neurons, immunolabel for both receptors was co-localized in neurites up to at least 40 μm away from the cell body. Neuronal processes were also observed originating from the same neuron that contained either exclusively D1 receptor immunolabel or D2 receptor immunolabel (Fig. 5B, arrows), suggesting the possibility of at least three distinct populations of dopamine receptors within the same cell. In neuronal cultures derived from neonatal rat striatum, D1 and D2 receptors were co-expressed in a significant proportion of cells (Fig. 5C). D2 receptor immunostaining was observed in every neuron examined, with intense immunolabel both in the cell bodies and throughout the full extent of their dendrites. Expression of D1 receptors was distinct from that of D2 receptors in"
https://openalex.org/W2076163730,"We have developed a genetic approach to examine the role of spontaneous activity and synaptic release in the establishment and maintenance of an olfactory sensory map. Conditional expression of tetanus toxin light chain, a molecule that inhibits synaptic release, does not perturb targeting during development, but neurons that express this molecule in a competitive environment fail to maintain appropriate synaptic connections and disappear. Overexpression of the inward rectifying potassium channel, Kir2.1, diminishes the excitability of sensory neurons and more severely disrupts the formation of an olfactory map. These studies suggest that spontaneous neural activity is required for the establishment and maintenance of the precise connectivity inherent in an olfactory sensory map."
https://openalex.org/W2109713015,"Dopamine input to the striatum is required for voluntary motor movement, behavioral reinforcement, and responses to drugs of abuse. It is speculated that these functions are dependent on either excitatory or inhibitory modulation of corticostriatal synapses onto medium spiny neurons (MSNs). While dopamine modulates MSN excitability, a direct presynaptic effect on the corticostriatal input has not been clearly demonstrated. We combined optical monitoring of synaptic vesicle exocytosis from motor area corticostriatal afferents and electrochemical recordings of striatal dopamine release to directly measure effects of dopamine at the level of individual presynaptic terminals. Dopamine released by either electrical stimulation or amphetamine acted via D2 receptors to inhibit the activity of subsets of corticostriatal terminals. Optical and electrophysiological data suggest that heterosynaptic inhibition was enhanced by higher frequency stimulation and was selective for the least active terminals. Thus, dopamine, by filtering less active inputs, appears to reinforce specific sets of corticostriatal synaptic connections."
https://openalex.org/W2087766892,"A necessary mediator of cardiac myocyte enlargement is protein synthesis, which is controlled at the levels of both translation initiation and elongation. Eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF2) mediates the translocation step of peptide-chain elongation and is inhibited through phosphorylation by eEF2 kinase. In addition, p70S6 kinase can regulate protein synthesis by phosphorylating eEF2 kinase or via phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6. We have recently shown that eEF2 kinase is also controlled by phosphorylation by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. Moreover, the mammalian target of rapamycin has also been shown to be inhibited, indirectly, by AMPK, thus leading to the inhibition of p70S6 kinase. Although AMPK activation has been shown to modulate protein synthesis, it is unknown whether AMPK could also be a regulator of cardiac hypertrophic growth. Therefore, we investigated the role of AMPK activation in regulating protein synthesis during both phenylephrine- and Akt-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Metformin and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-d-ribofuranoside were used to activate AMPK in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. Activation of AMPK significantly decreased protein synthesis induced by phenylephrine treatment or by expression of constitutively active Akt. Activation of AMPK also resulted in decreased p70S6 kinase phosphorylation and increased phosphorylation of eEF2, suggesting that inhibition of protein synthesis involves the eEF2 kinase/eEF2 axis and/or the p70S6 kinase pathway. Together, our data suggest that the inhibition of protein synthesis by pharmacological activation of AMPK may be a key regulatory mechanism by which hypertrophic growth can be controlled.

Cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by an enlargement of the cardiac myocyte that often occurs in response to increased hemodynamic load arising from a variety of conditions, including exercise, hypertension, and valvular heart disease. These morphological changes are adaptive responses that allow the heart to maintain cardiac output. Indeed, exercise-induced hypertrophy is not detrimental to the function of the myocardium and appears to be advantageous (1Richey P.A. Brown S.P. J. Sports Sci. 1998; 16: 129-141Google Scholar). However, hypertrophy arising from pathological conditions, such as sustained pressure overload, can become maladaptive and lead to cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and sudden death (see Ref. 2Lorell B.H. Carabello B.A. Circulation. 2000; 102: 470-479Google Scholar for review). Although initially adaptive, an alteration in cardiac energy substrate utilization involving a decrease in fatty acid oxidation and an increase in glucose utilization (3Allard M.F. Schonekess B.O. Henning S.L. English D.R. Lopaschuk G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H742-H750Google Scholar, 4Xia Y. Wen H.Y. Young M.E. Guthrie P.H. Taegtmeyer H. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13143-13150Google Scholar) can become maladaptive (5Lehman J.J. Kelly D.P. Heart Fail Rev. 2002; 7: 175-185Google Scholar). This switch in substrate utilization is also consistent with re-induction of several fetal gene products that regulate metabolism in the hypertrophied heart (see Ref. 5Lehman J.J. Kelly D.P. Heart Fail Rev. 2002; 7: 175-185Google Scholar for review). As a result, the altered metabolic profile found in the hypertrophic heart may play an important role in the development of hypertrophy and/or the progression to heart failure. At the molecular level, cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by an increase in myocardial cell size, a higher degree of sarcomeric organization, re-activation of the fetal gene program, and changes in gene transcription and translation resulting in enhanced protein synthesis (6Sugden P.H. Clerk A. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 725-746Google Scholar). A necessary mediator of cardiac myocyte enlargement is protein synthesis, which is controlled by both translation initiation and peptide-chain elongation (7Hannan R.D. Jenkins A. Jenkins A.K. Brandenburger Y. Clin Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2003; 30: 517-527Google Scholar, 8Browne G.J. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5360-5368Google Scholar).

Palfrey H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17299-17303Google Scholar). eEF2 is phosphorylated and inhibited by a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase called eEF2 kinase, which modifies threonine residue 56 (10Redpath N.T. Price N.T. Severinov K.V. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 689-699Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at Thr-56 results in the inactivation of eEF2 by causing a structural alteration that reduces its affinity for the ribosome, thereby preventing its ability to catalyze translocation (11Carlberg U. Nilsson A. Nygard O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 639-645Google Scholar). eEF2 kinase is also subjected to regulation by phosphorylation, and a number of phosphorylation sites have been identified that lead to subsequent activation or inhibition of activity (12Diggle T.A. Subkhankulova T. Lilley K.S. Shikotra N. Willis A.E. Redpath N.T. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 621-626Google Scholar, 13Wang L. Gout I. Proud C.G. J. Biol.

Biol. 2004; 24: 2986-2997Google Scholar). Most recently, we have shown that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, phosphorylates eEF2 kinase at a novel site in the regulatory domain, serine 398 (16Browne G.J. Finn S.G. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12220-12231Google Scholar), and activates it. In cardiac myocytes, Horman et al. (17Horman S. Beauloye C. Vertommen D. Vanoverschelde J.L. Hue L. Rider M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41970-41976Google Scholar) have shown that AMPK activation leads to increased eEF2 phosphorylation via eEF2 kinase activation, resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis. In addition, AMPK has recently been shown to be involved in modulating the activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (18Cheng S.W. Fryer L.G. Carling D. Shepherd P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15719-15722Google Scholar). mTOR is a kinase that responds to nutritional status and amino acid availability and is centrally involved in cell growth and proliferation (19Proud C.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 429-436Google Scholar, 20Fingar D.C. Salama S. Tsou C. Harlow E. Blenis J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1472-1487Google Scholar). Activated mTOR is able to phosphorylate p70S6 kinase (21Isotani S. Hara K. Tokunaga C. Inoue H. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34493-34498Google Scholar), which can inactivate eEF2 kinase (22Wang X. Li W. Williams M. Terada N. Alessi D.R. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4370-4379Google Scholar) as well as phosphorylate the 40 S ribosomal protein S6 (23Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 181-185Google Scholar). Recent work has also suggested that AMPK can inhibit mTOR signaling through the phosphorylation of TSC2, an upstream regulator of mTOR (24Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Google Scholar). Because AMPK may inhibit protein synthesis via a number of different pathways, it is possible that AMPK is also a key regulator of cardiac hypertrophy. AMPK is a serine/threonine protein kinase, which is activated by cellular stresses that deplete ATP (25Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 315-324Google Scholar). AMPK responds to increases in the AMP/ATP ratio by switching off ATP-consuming pathways and switching on pathways for ATP generation. It is a heterotrimeric protein comprised of a catalytic α subunit and two regulatory subunits, β and γ (26Stapleton D. Gao G. Michell B.J. Widmer J. Mitchelhill K. Teh T. House C.M. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29343-29346Google Scholar, 27Woods A. Cheung P.C. Smith F.C. Davison M.D. Scott J. Beri R.K. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10282-10290Google Scholar). The α subunit contains the kinase domain, and phosphorylation at threonine 172 of this subunit results in increased AMPK activity (28Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Google Scholar). Although recent evidence indicates that AMPK activation inhibits proteins synthesis (17Horman S. Beauloye C. Vertommen D. Vanoverschelde J.L. Hue L. Rider M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41970-41976Google Scholar, 29Horman S. Browne G. Krause U. Patel J. Vertommen D. Bertrand L. Lavoinne A. Hue L. Proud C. Rider M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1419-1423Google Scholar) and therefore possibly hypertrophy, AMPK activation has also been shown to correlate with the development of hypertrophy (30Tian R. Musi N. D'Agostino J. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1664-1669Google Scholar, 31Arad M. Moskowitz I.P. Patel V.V. Ahmad F. Perez-Atayde A.R. Sawyer D.B. Walter M. Li G.H. Burgon P.G. Maguire C.T.

For instance, pressure overload-induced hypertrophy has been shown to be associated with increased AMPK activity (30Tian R. Musi N. D'Agostino J. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1664-1669Google Scholar). In addition, AMPK has been linked to familial Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy via mutations in PRKAG2, the gene encoding the γ2 subunit of AMPK (32Gollob M.H. Green M.S. Tang A.S. Gollob T. Karibe A. Ali Hassan A.S. Ahmad F. Lozado R. Shah G. Fananapazir L. Bachinski L.L. Roberts R. Hassan A.S. N. Engl. J.

Genet. 2001; 10: 1215-1220Google Scholar, 34Daniel T. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 51017-51024Google Scholar). Although much has been learned about AMPK and protein synthesis and/or hypertrophic growth, the involvement of AMPK in the molecular mechanisms regulating cardiac hypertrophy is still unclear. Although a number of intracellular signaling pathways have been implicated in the complex regulation of the hypertrophic response (see Ref. 35Frey N. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 45-79Google Scholar for review), stimulation of the α1-adre-nergic receptor with agonists, such as phenylephrine, induces a hypertrophic phenotype in primary cultures of cardiac myocytes (36Knowlton K.U. Michel M.C. Itani M. Shubeita H.E. Ishihara K. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15374-15380Google Scholar). As a result, this has become an invaluable cellular model for the study of the hypertrophic response. In addition, the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt has been implicated in cardiac growth associated with physiological hypertrophy (37Shioi T. McMullen J.R. Kang P.M. Douglas P.S. Obata T. Franke T.F. Cantley L.C. Izumo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2799-2809Google Scholar, 38Shiojima I. Yefremashvili M. Luo Z. Kureishi Y. Takahashi A. Tao J. Rosenzweig A. Kahn C.R. Abel E.D. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37670-37677Google Scholar), and forced expression of constitutively activated Akt in the cardiac myocyte can be used as a separate model of cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, we have shown that activated Akt decreases the phosphorylation of AMPK at its primary activation site, Thr-172, resulting in an inhibition of activity of AMPK in the heart (39Kovacic S. Soltys C.L. Barr A.J. Shiojima I. Walsh K. Dyck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39422-39427Google Scholar). Although cardiac energy metabolism was the focus in that study, the ability of Akt to negatively regulate AMPK has other implications, including protein translation and the hypertrophic response. Indeed, it is possible that a contributing factor to Akt-induced hypertrophy may be the reduction of a protein synthesis inhibitor such as AMPK. Investigating the role of AMPK in protein synthesis associated with cardiac hypertrophy in both models will allow a better understanding of the complex pathways involved in the hypertrophic response and may enable the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent or inhibit pathological cardiac hypertrophy and improve heart function. Animal Care—The University of Alberta adheres to the principles for biomedical research involving animals developed by the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences and complies with National Institutes of Health animal care guidelines. Materials—Primary antibodies used in this study were rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473), rabbit anti-Akt, rabbit anti-phospho-α-AMPK (Thr-172), rabbit anti-α-AMPK, rabbit anti-phospho-eEF2 kinase (Ser-366 of the human sequence or Ser-365 of the rat sequence), rabbit anti-eEF2 kinase, rabbit anti-phospho-eEF2 (Thr-56), rabbit anti-eEF2, rabbit anti-phospho-p70S6 kinase (Thr-389), and rabbit anti-phospho-p70S6 kinase (Thr-421/Ser-424), all from Cell Signaling Technology. Rabbit anti-p70S6 kinase (C-18) primary antibody, and goat anti-rabbit and donkey anti-goat secondary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit anti-phospho-acetyl CoA carboxylase (Ser-79) antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Peroxidase-labeled streptavidin was purchased from Kirkegaard and Perry Labs. DNase, collagenase, and trypsin were purchased from Worthington. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's nutrient mixture F-12 (DMEM/F-12), fetal bovine serum, ITS+3 liquid media supplement, cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR), 1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride (metformin), l-phenylephrine hydrochloride (phenylephrine), mammalian protease inhibitor mixture, phosphatase inhibitor mixture I, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and fibronectin were all purchased from Sigma. Gentamicin and horse serum and all other tissue culture solutions were purchased from Invitrogen. [3H]Phenylalanine was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Culture—Cardiac myocytes were isolated from the hearts of 1- to 3-day-old neonatal rat pups essentially as described previously (39Kovacic S. Soltys C.L. Barr A.J. Shiojima I. Walsh K. Dyck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39422-39427Google Scholar). The cells were plated on Primeria dishes (Falcon) at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/plate. For measurement of [3H]phenylalanine incorporation, cells were plated on fibronectin-coated 12-well plates (Falcon) at a density of 3.3 × 105 cells/well. Cell Treatment—After 18 h of culture, neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were rinsed twice with serum-free DMEM/F-12 containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin and cultured in serum-free DMEM/F-12 containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin supplemented with 1× ITS+3 liquid media supplement and 10 μm cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside to prevent the growth of fibroblasts. After 24 h of culture at 37 °C in 5% CO2, cells were treated with vehicle (sterile ddH2O), 10 μm phenylephrine (PE), or 5 mm metformin or 1 mm AICAR in both the presence and absence of 10 μm PE in fresh serum-free media for 24 h at 37 °C. For viral infections, neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were infected with Ad.GFP or Ad.myrAkt1 (40Fujio Y. Nguyen T. Wencker D. Kitsis R.N. Walsh K. Circulation. 2000; 101: 660-667Google Scholar) adenovirus at the multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 immediately after changing to serum free media, as previously described (39Kovacic S. Soltys C.L. Barr A.J. Shiojima I. Walsh K. Dyck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39422-39427Google Scholar). After infection for 4 h cells were treated with vehicle, 5 mm metformin, or 1 mm AICAR in fresh serum-free media for 24 h. For immunoblot analysis purposes, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline and 150 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris·HCL (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm Na pyrophosphate, 0.25 m sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, mammalian protease inhibitor mixture, phosphatase inhibitor mixture I, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) was added to each plate after the appropriate treatment time. Cells were scraped and lysed for 10 min on ice and then centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the supernatant was then determined with the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad), and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. To visualize changes in cell size, additional sets of cells were also treated as above and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and fluorescence images were collected following immunocytochemistry using mouse anti-α actinin (Sigma) and Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch), as described previously (41Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Google Scholar). [3H]Phenylalanine Incorporation—Myocytes were plated in 12-well plates and cultured as described above. [3H]Phenylalanine (1 μCi/ml) was added at the time of drug treatment, and cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Preparation of precipitates to be counted was performed as previously described (42Foncea R. Andersson M. Ketterman A. Blakesley V. Sapag-Hagar M. Sugden P.H. LeRoith D. Lavandero S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19115-19124Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed three times with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h at 4 °C to precipitate the proteins. The precipitates were washed twice with 95% ethanol, then dissolved and scraped in 1 m NaOH. The resulting solution, which contained the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction, was neutralized with 1 m HCl, and the radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Immunoblot Analysis—Boiled samples of cell homogenates were subjected to SDS-PAGE in gels containing 5% or 8% acrylamide and transferred to nitrocellulose as previously described (43Soltys C.L. Buchholz L. Gandhi M. Clanachan A.S. Walsh K. Dyck J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1056-H1064Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk/1× TBS/0.1% Tween 20 and then immunoblotted at 1:1000 dilution (unless otherwise specified) with either rabbit anti-phospho-α-AMPK (Thr-172), rabbit anti-α-AMPK, rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473), rabbit anti-Akt, rabbit anti-phospho-eEF2 kinase (Ser-365) (1:250 dilution), rabbit anti-eEF2 kinase, rabbit anti-phospho-eEF2 (Thr-56), rabbit anti-eEF2, rabbit anti-phospho-p70S6 kinase (Thr-389), rabbit anti-phospho-p70S6 kinase (Thr-421/Ser-424), rabbit anti-p70S6 kinase (C-18), rabbit anti-phospho-acetyl CoA carboxylase (Ser-79) antibody, or peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (1:500 dilution) in 5% bovine serum albumin/1× TBS/0.1% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. After being washed extensively, the membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody in 5% milk/1× TBS/0.1% Tween 20, with the exception of the membrane immunoblotted for peroxidase-labeled streptavidin. After further washing, the antibodies were visualized using the Amersham Biosciences-enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system. Statistical Analysis—All data are presented as means ± S.E. For comparison of three groups, analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni multiple comparisons test was used for the determination of statistical analysis. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Effect of Metformin and AICAR on Protein Synthesis in Phenylephrine-treated Neonatal Rat Cardiac Myocytes—Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes treated with 10 μm phenylephrine displayed a significant 1.7-fold increase in protein synthesis over vehicle-treated cardiac myocytes (Fig. 1A). However, in the presence of 5 mm metformin, a known AMPK activator (44Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Google Scholar), phenylephrine-induced protein synthesis was significantly reduced (Fig. 1A). Another AMPK activator, AICAR (45Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Google Scholar), also significantly reduced phenylephrine-induced protein synthesis at a concentration of 1 mm (Fig. 1B) but to a lesser extent than metformin. A qualitative representation of the cell size for these treatments is shown in Fig. 1C. Effect of Metformin and AICAR on AMPK Activation in Phenylephrine-treated Neonatal Rat Cardiac Myocytes—To confirm that metformin and AICAR treatment resulted in AMPK activation, lysates from neonatal rat cardiac myocytes treated with 10 μm phenylephrine in the presence or absence of metformin or AICAR were subjected to immunoblot analysis using an antibody against the α subunit of AMPK (α-AMPK) phosphorylated at Thr-172. In cardiac myocytes treated with phenylephrine no significant change in α-AMPK phosphorylation was seen as compared with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 2A). However, the level of phosphorylated α-AMPK dramatically increased when cells were treated with either metformin or AICAR, independent of the presence of phenylephrine. The extent of increased α-AMPK phosphorylation was not statistically significant between metformin- and AICAR-treated cells (2.67 ± 0.57 versus 1.81 ± 0.62 arbitrary units). With either metformin or AICAR, AMPK is activated 2- to 3-fold, which correlates to a 40-60% reduction in protein synthesis (Fig. 1, A and B). Because phenylephrine-induced protein synthesis was not inhibited 100% by these agents, our data suggest that either AMPK needs to be more highly activated to completely inhibit phenylephrine-induced protein synthesis or that other regulatory pathways, independent from AMPK, also contribute to phenylephrine-induced protein synthesis. Although phosphorylation at Thr-172 is indicative of the activation state of α-AMPK, we also immunoblotted with anti-phospho-acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC; Ser-79) antibody to ascertain whether altered phosphorylation of α-AMPK had any effects on a downstream AMPK target protein such as ACC (46Davies S.P. Sim A.T. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 183-190Google Scholar). In accordance with AMPK activation, ACC phosphorylation was markedly elevated by both metformin and AICAR treatment relative to myocytes treated with vehicle alone (Fig. 2B). Because we have previously shown that there is cross-talk between Akt and AMPK in the cardiac myocyte (39Kovacic S. Soltys C.L. Barr A.J. Shiojima I. Walsh K. Dyck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39422-39427Google Scholar), we also measured the levels of Akt phosphorylation using anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) antibody in these treated myocytes (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, AICAR treatment (not metformin) also stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt at its activating phosphorylation site. Although it is unknown why this occurs, AICAR can stimulate the adenosine receptor (47Mullane K. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 43-47Google Scholar), which has been shown to result in increased Akt phosphorylation in the cardiac myocyte (48Krieg T. Qin Q. McIntosh E.C. Cohen M.V. Downey J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H2322-H2330Google Scholar). Regardless of the mechanism, AICAR activation of Akt may explain why the observed effect of AICAR on protein synthesis inhibition was less than that of metformin (Fig. 1, A and B). Effect of AMPK Activation on p70S6 kinase, eEF2 Kinase, and eEF2 Phosphorylation in Phenylephrine-treated Neonatal Rat Cardiac Myocytes—To better understand the signaling mechanisms that control protein synthesis in phenylephrine-induced cardiac hypertrophy, cell lysates from cardiac myocytes treated as described above were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-phospho-p70S6 kinase (Thr-389 and Thr-421/Ser-424) antibodies. Phosphorylation at these sites is closely related to p70S6 kinase activity (49Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6242-6251Google Scholar, 50Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Google Scholar). Phenylephrine increased the phosphorylation status of p70S6 kinase (Fig. 3A), which was dramatically reduced in the presence of metformin or AICAR (Fig. 3A). Although both activators of AMPK resulted in decreased p70S6 kinase phosphorylation, AICAR was not as effective in decreasing p70S6 kinase phosphorylation as metformin. One possible explanation for this may be that AICAR also activates Akt (Fig. 2C), which has previously been shown to result in p70S6 kinase phosphorylation (51Matsui T. Li L. Wu J.C. Cook S.A. Nagoshi T. Picard M.H. Liao R. Rosenzweig A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22896-22901Google Scholar). Cell lysates from cardiac myocytes treated as described above were also subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-phospho-eEF2 (Thr-56) and anti-phospho-eEF2 kinase (Ser-365) antibodies. Phenylephrine treatment of myocytes decreased the phosphorylation of eEF2, which is indicative of increased eEF2 activity and consistent with our previous findings (52Wang L. Proud C.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 285-289Google Scholar). In contrast, treatment of cardiac myocytes with metformin or AICAR resulted in a dramatic increase in the phosphorylation of eEF2 at Thr-56 (Fig. 3B), consistent with the idea that phosphorylation by AMPK activates eEF2 kinase. Because phosphorylation of eEF2 at Thr-56 results in a decrease in eEF2 activity and inhibition of protein synthesis (9Nairn A.C. Palfrey H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17299-17303Google Scholar), the increases seen in response to metformin or AICAR may, at least in part, explain the decrease in protein synthesis we observed in Fig. 1. Despite elevated p70S6 kinase phosphorylation in phenylephrine-treated myocytes, phosphorylation of eEF2 kinase at Ser-365 was not increased (22Wang X. Li W. Williams M. Terada N. Alessi D.R. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4370-4379Google Scholar). In addition, AMPK activation did not lead to a reduction in eEF2 kinase phosphorylation at Ser-365 in metformin- or AICAR-treated myocytes, either after phenylephrine treatment or in untreated myocytes (Fig. 3C). Effect of Metformin and AICAR on Protein Synthesis Induced by Forced Expression of Constitutively Active Akt1 in Neonatal Rat Cardiac Myocytes—Although this report shows that AMPK activation is able to inhibit phenylephrine-induced protein synthesis, its effect on Akt-induced hypertrophy is unknown. Because we have previously shown that a regulatory interaction between Akt and AMPK exists (39Kovacic S. Soltys C.L. Barr A.J. Shiojima I. Walsh K. Dyck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39422-39427Google Scholar), we speculated that Akt might negatively regulate phosphorylation of α-AMPK to promote protein synthesis associated with cardiac hypertrophy. To investigate this, neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were cultured and infected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing constitutively active Akt1 (Ad.myrAkt1) or GFP (Ad.GFP) as a control and, in some cases, treated with metformin or AICAR. Cardiac myocytes infected with Ad.myrAkt1 displayed dramatic increases in the expression of total Akt protein levels and a corresponding increase in the level of Akt phosphorylated at Ser-473, indicating increased Akt activity (53A"

However, the literature does not provide precise data on the temporal course of facial emotional processing. Intracranial event-related potentials to facial expressions were recorded in epileptic patients implanted with depth electrodes during a presurgical evaluation. Specific potentials to fear beginning 200 ms poststimulus were observed in amygdala, both individually in two patients and in a ten patient population study. These potentials occurred 100 ms earlier than potentials to disgust recorded in insula in a previous study. Potentials to fear were confined in amygdala during a first transient period and then, during a second period of sustained activity, spread to occipito-temporal, anterior temporal, and orbitofrontal cortex in two patients. This study clarifies the temporal course of the involvement of these structures known to be part of a neural network recruited to process emotional information."
https://openalex.org/W2028296303,"Spatially directed attention strongly enhances visual perceptual processing. The metaphor of the ""spotlight"" has long been used to describe spatial attention; however, there has been considerable debate as to whether spatial attention must be unitary or may be split between discrete regions of space. This question was addressed here through functional MR imaging of human subjects as they performed a task that required simultaneous attention to two briefly displayed and masked targets at locations separated by distractor stimuli. These data reveal retinotopically specific enhanced activation in striate and extrastriate visual cortical representations of the two attended stimuli and no enhancement at the intervening representation of distractor stimuli. This finding of two spotlights was obtained within a single cortical hemisphere and across the two hemispheres. This provides direct evidence that spatial attention can select, in parallel, multiple low-level perceptual representations."
https://openalex.org/W1980834036,"APOBEC3G, a member of an RNA/DNA cytidine deaminase superfamily, has been identified as a cellular inhibitor of HIV-1 infectivity, possibly through the dC to dU deamination of the first minus strand cDNA synthesized during reverse transcription. Virions incorporate APOBEC3G during viral assembly in non-permissive cells, and this incorporation is inhibited by the viral protein Vif. The mechanism of APOBEC3G incorporation into HIV-1 is examined in this report. In the absence of Vif, cytoplasmic APOBEC3G becomes membrane-bound in cells expressing HIV-1 Gag, and its incorporation into Gag viral-like particles (VLPs) is proportional to the amount of APOBEC3G expressed in the cell. The expression of Vif, or mutant Gag unable to bind to membrane, prevents the APOBEC3G association with membrane. HIV-1 Gag alone among viral proteins is sufficient for packaging of APOBEC3G into Gag VLPs, and this incorporation requires the presence of Gag nucleocapsid. The presence of amino acids 104-156 in APOBEC3G, located in the linker region between two zinc coordination motifs, is also required for its incorporation into Gag VLPs. Evidence against an RNA bridge facilitating the Gag/APOBEC3G interaction includes data indicating that 1) the incorporation of APOBEC3G occurs independently of viral genomic RNA, 2) a Gag/APOBEC3G complex is immunoprecipitated from cell lysate after RNase treatment, and 3) the zinc coordination motif, rather than the regions flanking this motif, have been implicated in RNA binding in another family member, APOBEC1.

Vif is required for HIV-1 to replicate in certain “non-permissive” cell types, such as primary T lymphocytes, macrophages, and some of T-cell lines, including H9, but is not required in other “permissive” cell types, such as SupT1 and Jurkat cells (3Fisher A.G.

Martin M.A. Nature. 1987; 328: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The ability of Vif-negative viruses to replicate in target cells is determined by the cell producing the virus (5Gabuzda D.H. Lawrence K. Langhoff E. Terwilliger E. Dorfman T. Haseltine W.A. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6489-6495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12von Schwedler U. Song J. Aiken C. Trono D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4945-4955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Vif-deficient viruses produced from non-permissive cells are impaired in their ability to replicate in target cells. Non-permissive cells have been found to contain a protein called APOBEC3G (also known as CEM-15), which prevents HIV-1 replication in the absence of Vif (13Sheehy A.M. Gaddis N.C. Choi J.D. Malim M.H. Nature. 2002; 418: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). APOBEC3G belongs to an APOBEC superfamily containing at least 10 members, which share a cytidine deaminase motif (14Jarmuz A. Chester A. Bayliss J. Gisbourne J. Dunham I. Scott J. Navaratnam N. Genomics. 2002; 79: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). These include APOBEC1 and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which have been shown to deaminate C in RNA (14Jarmuz A. Chester A. Bayliss J. Gisbourne J. Dunham I. Scott J. Navaratnam N. Genomics. 2002; 79: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) and DNA (15Neuberger M.S. Harris R.S. Di Noia J. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 305-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), respectively. It is not known if APOBEC3G can edit RNA, but several reports suggest that the anti-HIV-1 activity of this protein stems from its ability to form dU by deaminating dC in the first minus strand cDNA produced during HIV-1 reverse transcription (16Mangeat B. Turelli P. Caron G. Friedli M. Perrin L. Trono D. Nature. 2003; 424: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 17Zhang H. Yang B. Pomerantz R.J. Zhang C. Arunachalam S.C. Gao L.

Vif-negative HIV-1 produced in non-permissive cells package APOBEC3G during assembly while Vif-positive virions do not (13Sheehy A.M. Gaddis N.C. Choi J.D. Malim M.H. Nature. 2002; 418: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar, 16Mangeat B. Turelli P. Caron G. Friedli M. Perrin L. Trono D. Nature. 2003; 424: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). cDNA synthesis is low in the target cell infected with Vif-negative viruses, and the minus strand cDNA made contains 1-2% of the cytosines mutated to uracil. This could allow for cDNA degradation by the DNA repair system. The coding strand found in double-stranded cDNA also contains an increase in G to A mutations that could also contribute to the anti-viral activity of APOBEC3G through mutant coding regions for viral proteins. Vif is able to bind to APOBEC3G (20Mariani R. Chen D. Schrofelbauer B. Navarro F. Konig R. Bollman B. Munk C. Nymark-McMahon H. Landau N.R. Cell. 2003; 114: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) and can reduce both the cellular expression of APOBEC3G and its incorporation into virions (21Kao S. Khan M.A. Miyagi E. Plishka R. Buckler-White A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11398-11407Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The reduction in cellular expression has been attributed to both inhibition of APOBEC3G translation and its degradation in the cytoplasm by Vif (22Stopak K. de Noronha C. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 591-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), and recent evidence suggests that Vif interacts with cytoplasmic APOBEC3G as part of a Vif-Cul5-SCF complex, resulting in the ubiquination of APOBEC3G and its degradation (23Yu X. Yu Y. Liu B. Luo K. Kong W. Mao P. Yu X.F. Science. 2003; 302: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Enzymes similar to the human APOBEC superfamily are also encoded by the mouse and African green monkey (20Mariani R. Chen D. Schrofelbauer B. Navarro F. Konig R. Bollman B. Munk C. Nymark-McMahon H. Landau N.R. Cell. 2003; 114: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar), and a mouse gene on chromosome 15 (murine CEM15) shows amino acid similarity and structural homology with human APOBEC3G (13Sheehy A.M.

Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 207-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Vif is not present in the simple retrovirus MuLV, and Vif from HIV-1 is unable to prevent encapsidation of murine APOBEC into HIV-1, whose packaging results in severe inhibition of HIV-1 replication (20Mariani R. Chen D. Schrofelbauer B. Navarro F. Konig R. Bollman B. Munk C. Nymark-McMahon H. Landau N.R. Cell. 2003; 114: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Interestingly, while murine APOBEC is incorporated into murine leukemia virus, it appears to have little effect upon the replication of this virus (16Mangeat B. Turelli P. Caron G. Friedli M. Perrin L. Trono D. Nature. 2003; 424: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 18Harris R.S. Bishop K.N. Sheehy A.M. Craig H.M. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Watt I.N. Neuberger M.S. Malim M.H.

Landau N.R. Cell. 2003; 114: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the human APOBEC3G can inhibit the infectivity of different retroviruses including murine leukemia virus, and simian immunodeficiency virus, and equine infectious anemia virus (16Mangeat B. Turelli P. Caron G. Friedli M. Perrin L. Trono D. Nature. 2003; 424: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 18Harris R.S. Bishop K.N. Sheehy A.M. Craig H.M. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Watt I.N. Neuberger M.S. Malim M.H. Cell. 2003; 113: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar), although at lower efficiency than for HIV-1. The mechanism by which APOBEC3G is incorporated into Vif-negative HIV-1 is not clear. In this report, we present data that the incorporation of APOBEC3G into HIV-1 requires sequences found between the two zinc coordination motifs found in this protein (amino acids 104-156) and the nucleocapsid sequence in Gag. HIV-1 Gag alone among viral proteins is sufficient to package APOBEC3G into Gag viral-like particles (VLPs). Evidence is also presented that suggest that an RNA bridge between these two molecules is not involved in facilitating the Gag/APOBEC3G interaction. Plasmid Construction—SVC21BH10.P- is a simian virus 40-based vector that contains full-length wild-type HIV-1 proviral DNA containing an inactive viral protease (D25G) and was a gift from E. Cohen, University of Montreal. SVC21BH10.FS- contains mutations at the frameshift site, i.e. from 2082TTTTTT2087 to 2082CTTCCT2087, which prevents frameshifting during the translation of Gag protein and generates viruses that contain Gag but not Gag-Pol (25Cen S. Niu M. Saadatmand J. Guo F. Huang Y. Nabel G.J. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1042-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). ZWt-p6 encodes a full-length HIV-1 genome, in which the nucleocapsid sequence has been replaced with a yeast leucine zipper domain (26Accola M.A. Strack B. Gottlinger H.G. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5395-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). BH10.Vif-, BH10.P-.Vif-, BH10.FS-.Vif-, and ZWt-p6.Vif- were generated by introducing a stop codon right after ATG of the Vif reading frame at 5043, using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the following pair of primers: 5′-AGA TCA TTA GGG ATT TAG GAA AAC AGA TGG CAG and 5′-CTG CCA TCT GTT TTC CTA AAT CCC TAA TGA TCT. The human APOBEC3G cDNA was amplified from H9 mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR, using the following pair of primers: 5′-GCC AGA ATT CAA GGA TGA AGC CTC ACT TCA G and 5′-TAG AAG CTC GAG TCA AGC GTA ATC TGG AAC ATC GTA TGG ATA GTT TTC CTG ATT CTG GAG AAT GG. The cDNA fragment was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 V5/His A vector (Invitrogen), which expresses wild-type human APOBEC3G with a fused HA tag at the C terminus. To construct mutant APOBEC3G, this cDNA was PCR-amplified and digested with EcoRI and XhoI, whose sites were placed in each of the PCR primers. These fragments were cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pcDNA3.1 V5/His A vector. We used the following primers: wild-type: 5′-TAA GCG GAA TTC ATG AAG CCT CAC TTC AGA (forward primer) and 5′-TAG AAG CTC GAG TCA AGC GTA ATC TGG AAC (reverse primer); Δ1-57, 5′-TAG GCG GAA TTC ATG GTG TAT TCC GAA CTT AAG; Δ1-104, 5′-TAA GTC GAA TTC ATG GCC ACG TTC CTG GCC GAG; Δ1-156, 5′-TAA GTC GAA TTC ATG TTT CAG CAC TG TGG AGC; Δ157-384, 5′-TAG AAG CTC GAG TCA AGC GTA ATC TGG AAC ATC GTA TGG ATA TTC GTC ATA ATT CAT GAT; Δ246-384, 5′-TAG AAG CTC GAG TCA AGC GTA ATC TGG AAC ATC GTA TGG ATA CTG GTT GCA TAG AAA GCC; Δ309-384, 5′-TAG AAG CTC GAG TCA AGC GTA ATC TGG AAC ATC GTA TGG ATA GAT GCA CAG GCT CAC GTG. The resulting constructs expressing HA-tagged wild-type and mutant APOBEC3G were transfected into 293T cells. The hGag plasmid, which encodes the HIV-1 Gag sequence, produces mRNA whose codons have been optimized for mammalian codon usage and was a kind gift from G. Nabel, National Institutes of Health (27Huang Y. Kong W.-P. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). All the N- or C-terminally deleted Gag plasmids were constructed using PCR. hGag was PCR-amplified and digested with SalI and XbaI, whose sites were introduced in each of the PCR primers. These fragments were cloned into the SalI and XbaI sites of hGag. The following primers were used to construct these deletions: wild-type, 5′-ATA ATA GTC GAC ATG GGC GCC CGC GCC AGC GTG (forward primer) and 5′-GAC TGG TCT AGA AGG GCC TCC TTC AGC TGG (reverse primer); Δ1-132, 5′-GCG GCG GTC GAC ATG CCC ATC GTG CAG AAC ATC; Δ284-500, 5′-GCG GCG TCT AGA TTA CAG GAT GCT GGT GGG GCT; Δ377-500, 5′-GCG GCG TCT AGA TTA CAT GAT GGT GGC GCT GTT; Δ433-500, 5′-GCG GCG TCT AGA TTA AAA ATT AGC CTG TCG CTC. Cells, Transfections, and Viruses Purification—HEK-293T cells were grown in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml. For the production of viruses, HEK-293T cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Supernatant was collected 48 h post-transfection. Viruses were pelleted from culture medium by centrifugation in a Beckman Ti-45 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 1 h. The viral pellets were then purified by centrifugation in a Beckman SW 41 rotor at 26,500 rpm for 1 h through 15% sucrose onto a 65% sucrose cushion. The band of purified virus was removed and pelleted in 1× TNE ((20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) in a Beckman Ti-45 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 1 h. Viral RNA Isolation and Quantification—Total cellular and viral RNA was extracted using guanidinium isothiocynate, and the relative amount of HIV-1 viral RNA was quantified by dot blot hybridization, as described previously (28Jiang M. Mak J. Ladha A. Cohen E. Klein M. Rovinski B. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3246-3253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Variable known amounts of BH10 plasmid were used as a standard, and each sample of total cellular or viral RNA was blotted onto Hybond N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and was probed with a 5′-32P-end-labeled 30-mer DNA probe specific for the sequence from nucleotide 2211 to 2240 of the HIV-1 genome. Experiments were done in triplicate. The amounts of HIV-1 viral RNA per sample were analyzed using phosphorimaging (Bio-Rad), and the relative amount of viral RNA in cell lysates and virus preparations was determined. Protein Analysis—Cellular and viral proteins were extracted with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 100 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell and viral lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide), followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Western blots were probed with monoclonal antibodies that are specifically reactive with HIV-1 capsid (Zepto Metrocs Inc.), HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and β-actin (Sigma) or with Vif-specific polyclonal antiserum number 2221 (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program). Detection of proteins was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), using as secondary antibodies anti-mouse (for capsid and β-actin) and anti-rabbit (for HA and Vif), both obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Bands in Western blots were quantitated using UN-SCAN-IT gelTM automated digitizing system. Immunoprecipitation Assay—293T cells from 100-mm plates were collected 48 h post-transfection and lysed in 500 μl of TNT buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100). Insoluble material was pelleted at 1800 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was used as the source of immunoprecipitated Gag/APOBEC3G complexes. Equal amounts of protein were incubated with 30 μl of HA-specific antibody for 16 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. For a Western blot of different cell lysates, 500 μg of lysate protein was used for immunoprecipitation from each lysate, while for different nuclease experiments on the same lysate sample, ∼200 μg of lysate protein was used for immunoprecipitation. Lysate protein was determined by the Bio-Rad assay. The immunoprecipitate was then washed three times with TNT buffer and twice with phosphate-buffered saline. After the final supernatant was removed, 30 μl of 2× sample buffer (120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue) was added, and the precipitate was then boiled for 5 min to release the precipitated proteins. After microcentrifugation, the resulting supernatant was analyzed using Western blots. In the DNase and RNase treatment assay, the cell lysates were pretreated with 20 μg of DNase or RNase before the immunoprecipitation, as described previously (29Khorchid A. Halwani R. Wainberg M.A. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4131-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation and Sucrose Floatation Assay—Cells were lysed 48 h post-transfection at 4 °C by Dounce homogenization in 1.0 ml hypotonic TE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% β-mercaptoethanol), supplemented with protease inhibitors mixture (“Complete,” Roche Applied Science). The cell homogenate was then centrifuged at 1500 × g for 30 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. 0.5 ml of the resulting supernatant (S1) was mixed into 3 ml of final 73% sucrose. 7 ml of 65% sucrose in TNE were layered on top of the 73% sucrose, and 1.5 ml of 10% sucrose was layered on top of the 65% sucrose. The gradients were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a Beckman SW 55 Ti rotor overnight at 4 °C. 2-ml fractions were collected and diluted with 10 ml of TNT, and each fraction was centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The pellets from each fraction were dissolved in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Incorporation of APOBEC3G into Gag VLPs—293T cells were co-transfected with a plasmid coding for human APOBEC3G containing a C-terminal HA tag and plasmid containing wild-type or mutant HIV-1 proviral DNA. BH10.Vif- and BH10.P-.Vif- both contain a stop codon immediately after the initiation ATG codon of the Vif reading frame, and BH10P- contains an inactive viral protease. hGag contains a humanized HIV-1 Gag gene (i.e. codon usage optimized for translation in mammalian cells (27Huang Y. Kong W.-P. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)), and only wild-type HIV-1 Gag and Gag VLPs are produced (25Cen S. Niu M. Saadatmand J. Guo F. Huang Y. Nabel G.J. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1042-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The cell lysates of transfected cells were analyzed by Western blots (Fig. 1A), using anti-HA (top panel), anti-β-actin (middle panel), and anti-Vif (bottom panel) antibodies as probes. Vif is detected only in cells transfected with BH10. In cells producing virions or Gag VLPs lacking Vif, APOBEC3G is strongly expressed, while in cells producing BH10, very little APOBEC3G is seen in the cytoplasm. The viruses produced from these cells were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 1B), using anti-HA (top panel) and anti-CAp24 (bottom panel). While no APOBEC3G is seen in wild-type BH10, it is found in virions not expressing Vif. These results also indicate that Gag alone is sufficient among the viral proteins for facilitating APOBEC3G incorporation. Our results also confirm previous observations of a diminished presence of APOBEC3G in both the cytoplasm and in virions in the presence of Vif expression, and this has been shown to be due to the Vif-induced polyubiquination of APOBEC3G and subsequent degradation by the proteosome (22Stopak K. de Noronha C.

Yu Y. Yu X.F. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2072-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As well as lacking coding sequences downstream of Gag, the RNA coding for hGag has the 5′ RU5 and leader sequence of the viral RNA replaced with a cytomegalovirus promoter. Therefore, it is not expected that hGag VLPs will specifically package this RNA, which lacks viral packaging signals. This suggests that APOBEC3G incorporation into these particles occurs independently of viral genomic RNA packaging. To further confirm this, total RNA was extracted from cells co-transfected with APOBEC3G and either BH10.P-.Vif- or hGag and from the virions produced from these cells. Viral mRNA in the cells and viruses were quantified by dot blot, using a 32P-labeled DNA probe specific for the p6 coding sequence, which is present in both BH10.P-.Vif- and hGag RNA. The ratios for viral RNA:β-actin in the cytoplasm, and viral RNA:Gag in virions, is presented graphically in Fig. 1C. Although cytoplasmic expression of viral genomic RNA is strong in cells expressing hGag (top panel, Fig. 1C), the genomic RNA/Gag in hGag VLPs is reduced to ∼15% of that found in BH10.P-.Vif- (bottom panel, Fig. 1C). This reduced incorporation of viral RNA does not, however, affect APOBEC3G incorporation into hGag VLPs (B), indicating that APOBEC3G incorporation into virions occurs independently of viral RNA incorporation. The Nucleocapsid Sequence within Gag Is Required for the Viral Packaging of APOBEC3G—A series of Gag deletion constructs were used to identify the motif within Gag involved in the incorporation of APOBEC3G into viruses. These constructs are shown in Fig. 2A. 293T cells were co-transfected with APOBEC3G and wild-type or mutant Gag constructs, and cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Western blots of cell lysates (Fig. 2B) were probed with anti-CA (upper panel) or anti-HA (lower panel). The first lane represents cells transfected with hGag alone. All Gag mutants were expressed at similar levels in the cytoplasm except for the 378-500 construct. This Gag has NC, p1, and p6 deleted from the C terminus and is expressed 2-3-fold higher than full-length Gag. Most of these mutant Gag molecules are impaired in their ability to form extracellular particles due to the absence of membrane- or RNA-binding regions. We have therefore investigated the interaction between APOBEC3G and mutant Gag species using immunoprecipitation to detect cellular complexes. The presence of both Gag and APOBEC3G in the cell lysate was first analyzed by Western blots probed with anti-CA (Fig. 2B, upper panel) and anti-HA (Fig. 2B, lower panel). The Gag:APOBEC3G ratios, listed at the bottom of B, normalized to the hGag:APOBEC3G ratio, are similar for all mutant Gag species expressed, except for Δ378-500, which shows a higher expression of Gag. APOBEC3G in each cell lysate was then immunoprecipitated by anti-HA, and the presence of both Gag and APOBEC3G in the immunoprecipitate was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-CA (Fig. 2C, upper panel) and anti-HA (Fig. 2C, lower panel). The Gag:APOBEC3G ratios, listed at the bottom of C, normalized to the hGag:APOBEC3G ratio, indicate no change in the association of Gag with APOBEC3G with removal of the N-terminal matrix domain (MA) sequences (Δ1-132) and a small decrease (12%) with removal of the C-terminal p1/p6 sequences (Δ433-500). However, a C-terminal deletion of Gag, which also included NC (Δ378-500), resulted in a >95% reduction in the interaction of Gag with APOBEC3G, even though the expression of this mutant Gag is greater in the cell lysate than seen for hGag (Fig. 2B). A larger C-terminal Gag deletion (Δ284-500), in which p2 and the C-terminal region of capsid (including the MHR domain) have been further removed, also prevented interaction with APOBEC3G. These data suggest that nucleocapsid sequences within Gag are responsible for the interaction between APOBEC3G and Gag. The small decrease in the Gag: APOBEC3G ratio found with removal of the p1/p6 sequences might reflect an altered conformation affecting the neighboring NC-binding site in Gag. Both Gag nucleocapsid (33Berkowitz R.D. Ohagen Å. Höglund S. Goff S.P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6445-6456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and members of the APOBEC family, including APOBEC3G (14Jarmuz A. Chester A. Bayliss J. Gisbourne J. Dunham I. Scott J. Navaratnam N. Genomics. 2002; 79: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), can bind to RNA, so that the interaction demonstrated between Gag and APOBEC3G could be mediated by an RNA bridge. However, the data in Fig. 2D suggest that an RNA bridge is not likely. 293T cells were co-transfected with BH10.P-.Vif- and APOBEC3G, and the cell lysates were subjected to RNase or DNase treatment, followed by immunoprecipitation with either anti-integrase (IN) or anti-HA, respectively. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting, using anti-CA to detect the presence of Gag in the immunoprecipitate. The left side of D shows the effects of DNase and RNase upon the immunoprecipitation of Gag with anti-IN, which reacts with GagPol. We have previously reported that anti-IN will not immunoprecipitate Gag in the presence of RNase (29Khorchid A. Halwani R. Wainberg M.A. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4131-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the results on the left side of D repeat those results. The right side of D shows a similar experiment in which APOBEC3G is immunoprecipitated with anti-HA, and the co-immunprecipitation of Gag is determined. It can be seen that exposure of the immunoprecipitate to either RNase or DNase does not affect the co-immunprecipitation of APOBEC3G with Gag. While this suggests the lack of an RNA or DNA bridge between these two molecules, we cannot eliminate the possibility that a small RNA bridge may be pr"
https://openalex.org/W2021574716,"Episodic memory is often imbued with multisensory richness, such that the recall of an event can be endowed with the sights, sounds, and smells of its prior occurrence. While hippocampus and related medial temporal structures are implicated in episodic memory retrieval, the participation of sensory-specific cortex in representing the qualities of an episode is less well established. We combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a cross-modal paradigm, where objects were presented with odors during memory encoding. We then examined the effect of odor context on neural responses at retrieval when these same objects were presented alone. Primary olfactory (piriform) cortex, as well as anterior hippocampus, was activated during the successful retrieval of old (compared to new) objects. Our findings indicate that sensory features of the original engram are preserved in unimodal olfactory cortex. We suggest that reactivation of memory traces distributed across modality-specific brain areas underpins the sensory qualities of episodic memories."

The scattered MCH neurons have been difficult to study, as they have no defining morphological characteristics. We have developed a viral approach with AAV for selective long-term reporter gene (GFP) expression in MCH neurons, allowing the study of their cellular physiology in hypothalamic slices. MCH neurons showed distinct membrane properties compared to other neurons infected with the same virus with a cytomegalovirus promoter. Transmitters of extrahypothalamic arousal systems, including norepinephrine, serotonin, and the acetylcholine agonist muscarine, evoked direct inhibitory actions. Orexigenic neuropeptide Y was inhibitory by pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms; an anorexigenic melanocortin agonist had no effect. In contrast, the hypothalamic arousal peptide hypocretin/orexin evoked a direct inward current and increased excitatory synaptic activity and spike frequency in the normally silent MCH neurons. Together, these data support the view that MCH neurons may integrate information within the arousal system in favor of energy conservation."
https://openalex.org/W1982727893,"Noradrenergic, serotonergic, and histaminergic neurons are continuously active during waking, reduce discharge during NREM sleep, and cease discharge during REM sleep. Cataplexy, a symptom associated with narcolepsy, is a waking state in which muscle tone is lost, as it is in REM sleep, while environmental awareness continues, as in alert waking. In prior work, we reported that, during cataplexy, noradrenergic neurons cease discharge, and serotonergic neurons greatly reduce activity. We now report that, in contrast to these other monoaminergic ""REM-off"" cell groups, histamine neurons are active in cataplexy at a level similar to or greater than that in quiet waking. We hypothesize that the activity of histamine cells is linked to the maintenance of waking, in contrast to activity in noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons, which is more tightly coupled to the maintenance of muscle tone in waking and its loss in REM sleep and cataplexy."
https://openalex.org/W2129292492,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belong to the TGF-β superfamily and play an important role in development and in many cellular processes. We have found that BMP-2, BMP-6, and BMP-9 induce the most potent osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Expression profiling analysis has revealed that the Inhibitors of DNA binding/differentiation (Id)-1, Id-2, and Id-3 are among the most significantly up-regulated genes upon BMP-2, BMP-6, or BMP-9 stimulation. Here, we sought to determine the functional role of these Id proteins in BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation. We demonstrated that the expression of Id-1, Id-2, and Id-3 genes was significantly induced at the early stage of BMP-9 stimulation and returned to basal levels at 3 days after stimulation. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Id expression significantly diminished the BMP-9-induced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells. Surprisingly, a constitutive overexpression of these Id genes also inhibited osteoblast differentiation initiated by BMP-9. Furthermore, we demonstrated that BMP-9-regulated Id expression is Smad4-dependent. Overexpression of the three Id genes was shown to promote cell proliferation that was coupled with an inhibition of osteogenic differentiation. Thus, our findings suggest that the Id helix-loop-helix proteins may play an important role in promoting the proliferation of early osteoblast progenitor cells and that Id expression must be down-regulated during the terminal differentiation of committed osteoblasts, suggesting that a balanced regulation of Id expression may be critical to BMP-induced osteoblast lineage-specific differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.

Bone formation is a well orchestrated process of osteoblast lineage-specific differentiation (1Olsen B.R. Reginato A.M. Wang W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 191-220Google Scholar). During osteogenesis, pluri-potent mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into preosteoblasts rather than serve as progenitor cells for myocytes, adipocytes, or chondrocytes. These preosteoblasts then differentiate into mature osteoblasts that deposit the necessary components to form bone matrix and allow subsequent mineralization.

To gain insights into the signaling mechanisms behind BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation, we have analyzed the gene expression profiles of the preosteoblast precursor cells that were stimulated with osteogenic BMPs versus non-osteogenic BMPs (17Peng Y.

We found that Id-1, Id-2, and Id-3 are among the most significantly up-regulated genes upon stimulation of osteogenic BMPs, i.e. BMP-2, BMP-6, and BMP-9 (17Peng Y. Kang Q. Cheng H. Li X. Sun M.H.

However, the functional role of the Id proteins in BMP-induced osteogenic differentiation remains to be defined.Id genes were first identified in myoblasts, where they prevented myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors from binding to muscle-specific regulatory elements (23Kreider B.L. Benezra R. Rovera G. Kadesch T. Science. 1992; 255: 1700-1702Google Scholar, 24Norton J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3897-3905Google Scholar, 25Ruzinova M.B. Benezra R. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 410-418Google Scholar). As key regulators of tissue-specific gene expression, bHLH proteins function as obligate dimers and bind to DNA through the composite basic domains to activate the transcription of target genes containing E-boxes (CANNTG) in their promoters. Id proteins dimerize with bHLH proteins, but the resultant heterodimers are unable to bind to DNA because Id proteins lack the basic domains for DNA interaction. Of the four Id genes identified in mammals, Id-1 and Id-3 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas Id-2 and Id-4 exhibit a more restricted pattern of expression (23Kreider B.L. Benezra R. Rovera G. Kadesch T. Science. 1992; 255: 1700-1702Google Scholar, 24Norton J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3897-3905Google Scholar, 25Ruzinova M.B. Benezra R. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 410-418Google Scholar).In this study, we sought to determine the functional role of Id proteins in BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation. We first conducted expression profiling analysis and identified that Id-1, Id-2, and Id-3 were up-regulated in osteogenic BMP-stimulated mesenchymal stem cells. We next demonstrated that the expression of the Id-1, Id-2, and Id-3 genes was readily induced at an early stage of BMP-9 stimulation and returned to basal levels 3 days after stimulation. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Id expression diminished the BMP-9-induced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors. Surprisingly, a constitutive overexpression of Id genes also inhibited the osteoblast differentiation initiated by BMP-9. Our results demonstrate that Id proteins may play an important role in promoting the proliferation of early osteoblast progenitor cells and that Id expression must be down-regulated during terminal differentiation of committed osteoblasts. This suggests that a balanced regulation of Id gene expression may be critical to BMP-induced bone formation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Chemicals—C2C12 and C3H10T1/2 cell lines were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA).

At the indicated time after infection, total RNA was isolated using RNAgent total RNA isolation kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Microarray Hybridization and Analysis—Subconfluent C3H10T1/2 cells were infected with AdBMP-9 or AdGFP. At 30 h after infection, total RNA was isolated for target preparation. Microarray hybridizations (using Affymetrix mouse GeneChip 430A) and significance analysis of microarrays (28Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Google Scholar) and dChip clustering analysis were carried out as previously described (17Peng Y. Kang Q. Cheng H. Li X. Sun M.H. Jiang W. Luu H.H. Park J.Y. Haydon R.C. He T.-C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 90: 1149-1165Google Scholar). Hybridizations for BMP-9- and GFP-treated samples were done in triplicate.Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) Analysis—Ten micrograms of total RNA were used to generate cDNA templates for reverse transcriptase PCR. The first strand cDNA synthesis was performed using a hexamer (Promega) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The first strand cDNA products were diluted 10-fold and used as qRT-PCR templates. The qRT-PCR analysis used respective pairs of oligonucleotides (18-mers) to amplify the 3′-end (∼120 bp) of the Id-1, Id-2, and Id-3 genes. A list of the primers is available upon request. 2T.-C. He, personal communication. The SYBR Green-based qRT-PCR analysis was carried out using the Opticon DNA Engine thermocycler (M J Research, Waltham, MA). The cycling program was as follows: 94 °C × 2 min for one cycle, 4 cycles at 92 °C × 20 s, 68 °C × 30 s, and 72 °C × 20 s with a decrease of 3 degrees/cycle, and 30 cycles at 92 °C × 20 s, 57 °C × 30 s, and 72 °C × 20 s, followed by a plate read at 75 °C each cycle. A 10-fold serially diluted pUC19 was used as a standard. Triplicate reactions were carried out for each sample. All samples were normalized by the expression level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.RNAi-mediated Silencing of Id Expression—To generate small interfering RNA (siRNA) pools, we employed the in vitro Dicer-mediated digestions of double-stranded RNA derived from the target genes. Briefly, a pair of PCR primers (anchored with a T7 promoter sequence at the 5′-end of each primer) was used to amplify the target gene (e.g. Id-1, Id-2, Id-3,or GFP control). The purified PCR product was subjected to T7 RNA polymerase-mediated in vitro transcription (Promega). The resultant double stranded RNAs were subjected to recombinant Dicer (or RNase III) digestion (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection of the siRNA cocktails was carried out using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of the primers are available upon request. 2T.-C. He, personal communication.Western Blotting Analysis—At the indicated time points, the infected or transfected cells were lysed in Laemmli sample buffer and loaded on 4-20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After being resolved by electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) via electroblotting. The membranes were blocked with SuperBlock® DryBlend blocking buffer in Tris-buffered saline (Pierce) at room temperature for 1 h and probed with the Id-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Id-2, and Id-3 antibodies (BD Pharmingen) for 60 min, followed by a 30-min incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). The presence of Id proteins was detected by using the SuperSignal West Pico or West Femto chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce).Immunofluorescence Staining—The cells were fixed with methanol at -20 °C for 15 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline 2-3 times. The fixed cells were permeabilized with 1% Nonidet P-40/phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with goat serum at room temperature for 30 min, and followed by incubation of the cells with goat serum containing Id-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Id-2, and Id-3 antibodies (BD Pharmingen) for 60 min. After being washed, the cells were incubated with biotin-labeled secondary antibodies for 30 min. The presence of Id proteins was examined under a fluorescence microscope by incubating the cells with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes) for 20 min at room temperature. Stains without the primary and/or secondary antibodies, or with control IgG, were used as negative controls.Alkaline Phosphatase Activity—Alkaline phosphatase activity was assessed by colorimetric assay (using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate) and/or histochemical staining assay (using a mixture of 0.1 mg/ml naphthol AS-MX phosphate and 0.6 mg/ml Fast Blue BB salt) as previously described (15Cheng H.

Biochem. 2003; 90: 1149-1165Google Scholar).Proliferation Assay—C2C12 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and infected with the indicated adenoviral vectors. At 48 h after infection, cells were incubated with fresh medium containing 20 μl of CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution (Promega) for 1 h, followed by transferal of 60 μl of the medium from each well to that of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 96-well microtiter plates, and by reading absorbance at 490 nm. All samples were adjusted with the readings from the (no-cell) medium-only control. Each assay condition was done in triplicate.RESULTSId-1, Id-2, and Id-3 Helix-Loop-Helix Genes Are among the Most Significantly Up-regulated Early Targets of Osteogenic BMP-2, BMP-6, and BMP-9, but Not of Non-osteogenic BMPs—We have previously demonstrated that, among 14 BMPs, BMP-2, BMP-6, and BMP-9 exhibit the greatest ability to induce osteoblast differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells both in vitro and in vivo (15Cheng H. Jiang W. Phillips F.M. Haydon R.C. Peng Y. Zhou L. Luu H.H. An N. Breyer B. Vanichakarn P. Szatkowski J.P. Park J.P. He T.-C. J. Bone Jt. Surg. Am. 2003; 85-A: 1544-1552Google Scholar, 16Kang Q.

To understand the mechanisms behind BMP-mediated osteogenic signaling, we compared the expression patterns in preosteoblast progenitor C2C12 cells stimulated with three osteogenic BMPs (i.e. BMP-2, BMP-6, and BMP-9) and two inhibitory/non-osteogenic BMPs (i.e. BMP-3 and BMP-12), as well as with the GFP control (17Peng Y. Kang Q. Cheng H. Li X. Sun M.H. Jiang W. Luu H.H. Park J.Y. Haydon R.C. He T.-C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 90: 1149-1165Google Scholar). We found that the overall expression pattern of the osteogenic BMPs was similar to each other but distinct from those of BMP-3, BMP-12, and the GFP control (17Peng Y. Kang Q. Cheng H. Li X. Sun M.H. Jiang W. Luu H.H. Park J.Y. Haydon R.C. He T.-C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 90: 1149-1165Google Scholar). Significance Analysis of Microarrays (28Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Google Scholar) revealed that there were 203 genes whose expression changed by at least 2-fold, 105 up-regulated and 98 down-regulated by osteogenic BMPs. Interestingly, three of the Id helix-loop-helix genes, Id-1, Id-2, and Id-3, were among the top 10 most significantly up-regulated genes by the osteogenic BMPs (17Peng Y. Kang Q. Cheng H. Li X. Sun M.H. Jiang W. Luu H.H. Park J.Y. Haydon R.C. He T.-C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 90: 1149-1165Google Scholar). The microarray data indicated that the three Id genes were readily induced by BMP-2, BMP-6, and BMP-9 (up to 30-fold) but were not affected by BMP-3. BMP-3 has been shown to function as a negative regulator of bone formation because BMP-3 null mice exhibit higher bone density (29Daluiski A. Engstrand T. Bahamonde M.E. Gamer L.W. Agius E. Stevenson S.L. Cox K. Rosen V. Lyons K.M. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 84-88Google Scholar).Next, we carried out an expression profiling analysis in osteogenic BMP-stimulated C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells using Affymetrix mouse GeneChip 430A (each contains over 22,000 gene probes). Subconfluent C3H10T1/2 cells were infected with AdBMP-2, AdBMP-6, AdBMP-9, or AdGFP for 30 h, and RNA was isolated for microarray hybridizations. As shown in Fig. 1A, the normalized signal intensities for the three Id genes were notably higher in the osteogenic BMP-stimulated samples than in the GFP control. The microarray results were of good quality, as two of the known BMP targets, Smad6 and Smad7, were significantly induced by BMP-2, BMP-6, and BMP-9 but not by GFP. The triplicate hybridizations for BMP-9- and GFP-treated samples were further characterized by dChip clustering analysis. As shown in Fig. 1B, the expression of the Id-1, Id-2, and Id-3 genes was up-regulated in BMP-9-stimulated C3H10T1/2 cells, consistent with our earlier findings in C2C12 cells (17Peng Y. Kang Q. Cheng H. Li X. Sun M.H. Jiang W. Luu H.H. Park J.Y. Haydon R.C. He T.-C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 90: 1149-1165Google Scholar).We next sought to verify whether the three Id genes were indeed induced by osteogenic BMPs. In this study, we focused on BMP-9 because we have found that BMP-9 is one of the most potent osteogenic BMPs, and yet it is one of the least characterized BMPs. Experimentally, C3H10T1/2 and C2C12 cells were infected with AdBMP-9 or AdGFP, and total RNA was isolated at 1, 2, 3, and/or 5 days after infection. The expression level of individual Id genes was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, the BMP-9-induced expression of the three Id genes peaked in the day 1 or day 2 samples in C3H10T1/2 cells. The expression of the three Id genes returned to baseline at 5 days after infection. Similar trends were observed in C212 cells (Fig. 2, C and D). The expression of all three Id genes was induced by BMP-9 with the highest level observed in the day 1 samples (e.g. 17-, 41-, and 8-fold increases for Id-1, Id-2, and Id-3, respectively). At day 3 after infection, the expression of the three Id genes had almost returned to basal levels. We also found that the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was not significantly changed (<2-fold) in all samples (data not shown). We next sought to determine the level of the three Id proteins upon BMP-9 stimulation using Western blotting analysis. Consistent with the results of quantitative real-time PCR analysis, the levels of Id-1, Id-2, and Id-3 proteins were elevated in BMP-9-stimulated C2C12 cells at days 1 and 2 but had almost returned to basal levels by day 3 (Fig. 2E). Taken together, our qRT-PCR and Western blotting analyses demonstrate that Id-1, Id-2, and Id-3 are indeed early targets of BMP-9 signaling.Fig. 2Verification of BMP-9-induced Id-1, Id-2, and Id-3 gene expression in C3H10T1/2 and C2C12 cells.A-D, quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Subconfluent C3H10T1/2 (A and B) and C2C12 (C and D) cells were infected with AdBMP-9 or AdGFP. Total RNA was collected at the indicated times and subjected to quantitative real-time PCR analysis using pUC19 as a DNA quantitation standard (A and C). All samples were normalized for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression. Reactions were done in triplicate. Fold of induction was calculated by dividing the transcript level of BMP-9-treated samples with that from GFP-treated samples (B and D). E, Western blotting analysis. Subconfluent C2C12 cells were infected with AdGFP (GFP) or AdBMP-9 (BMP-9). Total cell lysate was collected at the indicated time points and subjected to Western blotting analysis using antibodies against mouse Id-1, Id-2, and Id-3.

Massague J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 915-926Google Scholar). However, the actual role of Id proteins in BMP-mediated bone formation is not known. We sought to determine whether or not the RNA interference-mediated depletion or knockdown of Id gene expression would have any effect on BMP-9-induced osteogenic differentiation. To generate double-stranded siRNAs that efficiently target Id transcripts, we synthesized double-stranded RNAs corresponding with the coding regions of Id-1, Id-2, and Id-3 genes via in vitro transcription. These double-stranded RNA products were subjected to recombinant Dicer digestion, resulting in the siRNA pools (i.e. siId-1, siId-2, and siId-3). A control siRNA pool targeting GFP was also prepared. The produced siRNA pools were first tested for their efficiency and specificity of gene silencing. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the siRNAs targeted the respective Id gene expression rather specifically, and the GFP control siRNAs did not affect the expression of Id genes as demonstrated by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 3A) and immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 3B) using specific Id antibodies. We also confirmed that there was no detectable cross-targeting activity of the Id siRNA pools (data not shown).Fig. 3Inhibition of BMP-induced osteogenic differentiation by RNAi-mediated knockdown of Id gene expression.A and B, specificity of the siRNA cocktails targeting Id genes. A, C2C12 cells were transfected with different siRNA cocktails, followed by AdBMP-9 infection.

Nonspecific bands (NSB, blank arrows) indicated a relatively equal loading of the samples. B, C2C12 cells were transfected and infected essentially as described for panel A. At 36 h, the cells were fixed and stained with anti-Id-1 (top row), anti-Id-2 (middle row), or anti-Id-3 (bottom row) antibodies and detected with Alexa Fluor-594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes).

Therefore, the concept of stimulating myocyte mitotic divisions has dramatic implications for cardiomyocyte regeneration and hence, cardiovascular disease. Previous reports describing manipulation of cell cycle proteins have not shown induction of cardiomyocyte mitosis after birth. We now report that cyclin A2, normally silenced in the postnatal heart, induces cardiac enlargement because of cardiomyocyte hyperplasia when constitutively expressed from embryonic day 8 into adulthood. Cardiomyocyte hyperplasia during adulthood was coupled with an increase in cardiomyoctye mitosis, noted in transgenic hearts at all time points examined, particularly during postnatal development. Several stages of mitosis were observed within cardiomyocytes and correlated with the nuclear localization of cyclin A2. Magnetic resonance analysis confirmed cardiac enlargement. These results reveal a previously unrecognized critical role for cyclin A2 in mediating cardiomyocyte mitosis, a role that may significantly impact upon clinical treatment of damaged myocardium.

It is well established that the proliferative and hence, regenerative potential of adult mammalian cardiomyocytes is quite limited (1Rumyantsev P.P. Growth and Hyperplasia of Cardiac Muscle Cells. Harwood Academic Publishers, New York1991Google Scholar). This view has recently been challenged by a few reports, which contend that adult ventricular myocytes, under certain circumstances, appear to re-enter the cell cycle and proliferate (2Leri A.

The bulk of evidence maintains, however, that mammalian cardiomyocytes cease to proliferate in the early neonatal period (8Beinlich C.J. Morgan H.E. Mol.

Among the cyclins, cyclin A2 is unique in that it regulates progression through two critical transitions: cyclin A2 complexed with cdk2 is essential for the G1/S transition and cyclin A2/cdk1 promotes entry into mitosis (17Sherr C.J.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). It is also the only cyclin to be down-regulated at both the message and protein level in rat, human (19Yoshizumi M. Lee W.S. Hsieh C.M. Tsai J.C. Li J. Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Endege W.O. Schlegel R. Lee M.E. J. Clin.

We hypothesized that down-regulation of cyclin A2 may thus play a crucial role in cardiomyocyte cell cycle exit, and conversely, that continued expression of cyclin A2 in the heart would result in altered cell division and importantly, cardiomyocyte hyperplasia.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of Transgenic Mice—Mouse cyclin A2 cDNA was subcloned into a vector (clone 26 from Dr. Jeffrey Robins, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH) containing α-myosin heavy chain (MHC) promoter and the human growth hormone polyadenylation site (20Subramaniam A. Jones W.K. Gulick J. Wert S. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24613-24620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were then generated according to previous protocols (21Behringer R.R. Crotty D.A. Tennyson V.M. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Wolgemuth D.J. Development. 1993; 117: 823-833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All manipulations were performed according to Institutional Animal Care and Use Guidelines. Pups were screened for the presence of the transgene by genomic DNA blot hybridization (21Behringer R.R. Crotty D.A. Tennyson V.M. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Wolgemuth D.J. Development. 1993; 117: 823-833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using cyclin A2 cDNA as a probe. Six lines of transgenic mice were established on a B6CBA background. Phenotypic characterization in this study was carried out using the F1 generation. All analyses in this study were performed on transgenic mice using nontransgenic littermates as controls.Assessment of Heart Size/Body Weight Ratios—Each mouse was weighed and then anesthetized with avertin. 3 m KCl was injected into the beating heart to induce diastolic arrest. Hearts were gently perfused with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and fat tissue was removed before weighing the hearts. Heart to body weight ratios were measured for postnatal day (PN) 7 and 14 and adult (3–18 months).Assessment of Cell Sizes—Whole ventricular sections from adult (6 months) mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Sequential transverse sections (4 μm) were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Digital pictures were captured at ×40 magnification, and cell-analysis software (UTHSCSA Image Tool) was employed to measure cross-sectional areas of myocytes. At least 200 cells/heart were measured for each of two lines (lines 1 and 58). Only cells with clearly delineated borders were measured. Cell lengths were measured utilizing the same program after immunostaining for pancadherin (Sigma), a structural protein found in the intercalated discs (22Bianchi C. Araujo E.G. Sato K. Sellke F.W. Circulation. 2001; 104: I319-I324Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), again at ×40 magnification. Only those myocytes (>200 cells/heart) that could be visualized end-to-end were assessed.Assessment of Myocyte Number—Ventricles were dissected from 10 transgenic and 10 control hearts and weighed. The average ventricular weight/total heart weight ratio was computed for both transgenic and control hearts and used to compute ventricular weight for the hearts used in measurements of myocyte cross-sectional area and length. Ventricular weight was multiplied by the known value for specific gravity of muscle tissue, 1.06 gm/ml to obtain ventricular volume (23Mendez J. Keys A. Metabolism. 1960; 9: 184-188Google Scholar). The calculated ventricular volume was multiplied by 0.82 to determine the fraction occupied by myocytes (24Jackson T. Allard M.F. Sreenan C.M. Doss L.K. Bishop S.P. Swain J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3709-3716Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The average volume of each myocyte was calculated by multiplying myocyte cross-sectional area by length. The number of myocytes per ventricle was computed by dividing the myocyte fraction of ventricular volume by the average myocyte volume.Northern Blot Analyses—RNA was isolated from total hearts using TriReagent (Sigma). RNA samples (10 μg/lane) were electrophoresed on denaturing 0.8% agarose/2.2 m formaldehyde gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes according to standard protocols (25Ravnik S.E. Wolgemuth D.J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The 1.7 kb cyclin A2 cDNA (25Ravnik S.E. Wolgemuth D.J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was radiolabeled with [γ-32P]UTP and hybridized overnight at 65 °C in 4× SSC, 2× Denhardt's, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Blots were washed at 65 °Cin2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and signal was visualized by autoradiography at -70 °C. The integrity of RNA samples was established by staining blots with methylene blue (25Ravnik S.E. Wolgemuth D.J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Immunoblot Analyses—Heart tissue was homogenized in tissue lysis buffer, protein lysates were prepared, and immunoblots performed according to standard methods described by Soonpaa et al. (26Soonpaa M.H. Koh G.Y. Pajak L. Jing S. Wang H. Franklin M.T. Kim K.K. Field L.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 2644-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with antibodies to cyclin A2 (1:200), cdk2 (1:300), cyclin B1 (1:400), cyclins D2 (1:200), and D3 (1:200), p21 (1:200), p27 (1:100) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and cdk1 (1:300, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Detection with GAPDH antibody (1:200, Roche Applied Science) was used as a loading control. Subcellular fractionation was performed using the Nuclear Extract kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Lamin A/C antibody (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was the loading control for nuclear fractions. Signal was visualized by autoradiography using enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Autoradiograms were scanned and analyzed by Kodak One-Dimensional Image Analysis software (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Net intensity values were calculated by subtracting the background within the area measured for each band from the total intensity within this same measured area.Immune Precipitations—Hearts were homogenized in tissue lysis buffer and processed as above. The following is a modification of Basi and Draetta (27Basi G. Draetta G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Homogenate from each sample (250 μg) was preadsorbed with protein A-Sepharose beads (50 μl of a 0.1 mg/ml suspension, Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and the preadsorbed homogenate was reacted with 1 μg of antibody to cyclin A2 in a final volume of 750 μl in tissue lysis buffer. The mixture was incubated with rocking for 1 h at 4 °C. 50 μl of protein A beads were added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 1 h. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with PBS buffer, and eluted in SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 1 mN-ethylmaleimide (to limit light chain migration) for 10 min at 95 °C. Samples were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gels, electroblotted to nitrocellulose, and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described above with antibodies to cdk1 and cdk2.Histone H1 Kinase Assays—Preadsorbed tissue homogenate was prepared as above using cdk lysis buffer (16Brooks G. Poolman R.A. McGill C.J. Li J.M. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2261-2271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and reacted with 1 μg of antibody to cyclin A2 with rocking for 1 h at 4 °C. 50 μl of protein A beads were added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplex beads were washed three times with 1 ml of cdk lysis buffer, then centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 125 μg/ml histone H1 substrate protein and incubated for 5 min at 30 °C. To each reaction tube, 5 μl of ATP buffer was added and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Samples were resolved on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel, the gel was dried, and exposed to x-ray film overnight at -70 °C. Net intensity quantification was performed as described above.Assessment of Cardiomyocyte DNA Synthesis—Whole ventricular sections from embryonic (E18), postnatal (PN2, PN7, PN14) and adult (6 month) hearts were fixed and embedded in paraffin as described above. Sequential transverse (4 μm) sections were cut and analyzed by immunohistochemistry as described previously (21Behringer R.R. Crotty D.A. Tennyson V.M. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Wolgemuth D.J. Development. 1993; 117: 823-833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using antibody (1:100) to PCNA (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) as an indicator of DNA synthesis (28Haracska L. Unk I. Johnson R.E. Phillips B.B. Hurwitz J. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To localize PCNA-positive nuclei in cardiomyocytes, co-immunofluorescence (29Liao C. Wang X.Y. Wei H.Q. Li S.Q. Merghoub T. Pandolfi P.P. Wolgemuth D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6853-6858Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) staining was performed utilizing α-sarcomeric actin (1:200, Sigma). Similar fields were compared at ×40 magnification, and the number of cardiomyocyte nuclei staining positively for PCNA were counted per field. The total number of cardiomyocyte nuclei per field were counted, and the ratio of PCNA-positive nuclei to the total number of nuclei was computed. This ratio was averaged over at least ten fields to compute the index of PCNA-positive nuclei.Assessment of Cardiomyocyte Nuclei per Unit Area—Whole ventricular sections from 6-month-old mice from lines 1 and 58 were prepared as above. Immunofluorescence staining (29Liao C. Wang X.Y. Wei H.Q. Li S.Q. Merghoub T. Pandolfi P.P. Wolgemuth D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6853-6858Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with antibody to α-sarcomeric actin to delineate cardiomyocytes was performed as above. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nuclei within cardiomyocytes were counted for each field (16,800 μm2).Assessment of Mitosis—Immunofluorescence staining (29Liao C. Wang X.Y. Wei H.Q. Li S.Q. Merghoub T. Pandolfi P.P. Wolgemuth D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6853-6858Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with antibody (1:50) to phosphorylated histone-3 (H3P, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), a mitosis-specific marker (30Wei Y. Mizzen C.A. Cook R.G. Gorovsky M.A. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7480-7484Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), was performed on ventricular sections at various developmental stages. Cardiomyocytes were identified with antibody to α-sarcomeric actin as above. Antirabbit rhodamine (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used as the secondary antibody for the H3P antibody, and anti-mouse IgM fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) was used as the secondary against α-sarcomeric actin. The number of cardiomyocyte nuclei staining positively for H3P were counted per field at ×40 magnification under fluorescent field optics. The total number of cardiomyocyte nuclei per field were counted, and a mitotic index was computed as the ratio of H3P-positive nuclei to total nuclei. The mitotic indices for at least ten fields were averaged at each developmental stage analyzed. Rotational analysis for localization to cardiomyocytes was performed using confocal microscopy through 10-micron thick sections.Isolated Cardiomyocyte Preparations—Isolated ventricular cells were dissociated from hearts obtained from PN7 transgenic and PN7 strain-matched wild-type mice using 0.07% trypsin/1 mm EDTA in Hank's solution, a modification of previously described methods (31Reinecke H. Zhang M. Bartosek T. Murry C.E. Circulation. 1999; 100: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto microscope slides (after two rounds of pre-plating to minimize fibroblast concentration), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and examined by immunofluorescence staining with antibody (1:200) to α-sarcomeric actin and DAPI.Assessment of Cardiac Function—MRI image acquisition and analyses were performed on a 9.4 Tesla Bruker WB400 microimaging system with 30 mm of quadrature RF coil (Brucker NMR Inc., Bellerica, MA). The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5% vol. in 2 liters/min air flow). The heart rate was ∼450 bpm. Quantitation of ventricles was based on bright blood two-dimensional image stacks that were acquired using ECG-gated fast gradient echo cine sequence. The acquisition parameters were 250 ms repetition time, 1.8 ms echo time, 30° flip angle, 0.1 mm in-plane resolution, 1 mm slice thickness, and 4 min/slice scan time. Eight cardiac points were sampled over the cardiac cycle. The short axis images were acquired from which the left ventricle and myocardium was semi-automatically segmented using region-growing algorithm and histogram-based thresholding (32Tang H. Vasselli J. Wu E. Gallagher D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 904: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used for data comparison, using a significance level of p < 0.05.RESULTSTo demonstrate that cyclin A2 is silenced in the mouse heart shortly after birth concomitant with withdrawal from mitosis, the relative levels of cyclin A2 mRNA and protein expression were assayed at selected times during murine cardiac development. Northern blot analysis revealed that cyclin A2 transcripts of 3.0 and 1.7 kb were observed at E12, E18, and PN2, but not at 6 weeks of age (Fig. 1A). Immunoblot analysis could not detect cyclin A2 protein at PN2 and later time points (Fig. 1B). The number of ventricular cardiomyocyte nuclei expressing cyclin A2 protein as detected by immunohistochemical analysis was high at E14 with a noticeable decline at E18, a further diminution at PN2, and complete absence by PN14 (Fig. 1C). This temporal pattern of decreased expression of cyclin A2 mRNA and protein levels is consistent with the previously described silencing of cyclin A2 in the hearts of rats and humans shortly after birth (19Yoshizumi M. Lee W.S. Hsieh C.M. Tsai J.C. Li J. Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Endege W.O. Schlegel R. Lee M.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 2275-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and also coincides with cardiomyocyte cell cycle withdrawal (8Beinlich C.J. Morgan H.E. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1993; 119: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 9Casscells W. Speir E. Sasse J. Klagsbrun M. Allen P. Lee M. Calvo B. Chiba M. Haggroth L. Folkman J. Epstein S. J. Clin.

Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 189-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To test the hypothesis that sustained cyclin A2 expression would modulate cardiomyocyte proliferation, transgenic mice that constitutively express cyclin A2 in the cardiomyocyte lineage were generated (21Behringer R.R. Crotty D.A. Tennyson V.M. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Wolgemuth D.J. Development. 1993; 117: 823-833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MHC promoter was chosen because it is expressed from E7.5, throughout embryogenesis, and continues to be expressed through adulthood (20Subramaniam A. Jones W.K. Gulick J. Wert S. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24613-24620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Eight founders were identified after screening 60 pups derived from microinjected embryos, and six gave rise to transgenic lineages. Cyclin A2 transgenic mice were fertile, appeared healthy, and were not prone to alteration in morbidity and mortality over 1.5 years of observation. Cyclin A2 expression was assessed in at least three hearts from each line at 5–7 months of age by Northern analysis, with a representative blot shown in Fig. 2B. Lines 1, 2, 44, and 58 consistently express the expected cyclin A2 transgenic 2.3 kb mRNA, although there was some variation in the levels of expression from animal to animal within the same line. Other adult organs, such as the kidney (Fig. 2B and data not shown), failed to show cyclin A2 expression in transgenic mice, consistent with the previously described myocardial specificity of the MHC promoter (20Subramaniam A. Jones W.K. Gulick J. Wert S. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24613-24620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a 3.0-kb band is also visualized in transgenic heart mRNA. This size is consistent with the larger endogenous cyclin A2 transcript and is not seen in control heart mRNA. Cyclin A2 protein expression, assayed by immunoblot analysis, was confirmed in all 4 lines above (data not shown), but line 58 was selected for more detailed analysis. Cyclin A2 protein expression is shown in transgenic hearts from line 58 at ages PN14 and 2 months and is absent in control hearts at both time points (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Transgenic mouse model constitutively expressing cyclin A2.A, diagram of MHC-CYCA2 transgenic construct. B, representative Northern blot analysis of transgenic mice (t23 and t27) and control mice (n1 and n2). H and K indicate heart and kidney, respectively. Blot was re-exposed for a shorter period of time to delineate detail in the t23-H lane. Ethidium bromide-stained ribosomal bands are shown as loading controls. C, immunoblot analysis of cyclin A2, cdk1 and cdk2 with GAPDH as loading control in transgenic (Tg) and non-transgenic (N) hearts at PN14 and 2 months of age. HeLa lysate was the positive control. D, subcellular localization of cyclin A2 protein in Tg and N hearts at PN7 and PN14 utilizing nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extracts. GAPDH is the loading control for cytoplasm, whereas Lamin A/C is the loading control for nuclear extracts. E, immunoprecipitation of cyclin A2 complexes in Tg and N hearts at PN14, and 2-month α-cyclin A2-immunoprecipitated complexes were analyzed by immunoblot with α-cdk1 or α-cdk2. HeLa cell lysate was the positive control. F, H1 histone kinase assay of Tg and N heart protein lysates from PN7, PN14, and 2-month NC represents negative control (lysis buffer with no sample), and thymus is the positive control.

K, immunoblot analyses of cyclin D2 and D3 expression in Tg and N hearts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine if the continued expression of cyclin A2 altered the expression of cdk1 and cdk2, lysates were analyzed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2C). An average 1.6-fold and 1.2-fold increase in the levels of cdk1 protein at PN14 and 2 months, respectively, were observed in total transgenic hearts, notably different from the low levels of constitutive expression of cdk1 in controls. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated low levels of expression of cdk2 in control hearts, consistent with studies by others (33Oh H. Taffet G.E. Youker K.A. Entman M.L. Overbeek P.A. Michael L.H. Schneider M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10308-10313Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an average 2.5- and 2.1-fold increase in the expression of cdk2 in transgenic hearts was observed at PN14 and 2 months of age, respectively.To determine the subcellular distribution of cyclin A2 protein, lysates were prepared from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions at PN7 and PN14. In transgenic hearts, cyclin A2 was noted to be predominantly localized to the nucleus at PN7, but largely in cytoplasm by PN14 (Fig. 2D). No protein was detected in either the nucleus or cytoplasm in control hearts at PN7 or PN14 (Fig. 2D).To determine whether this temporally ectopically expressed cyclin A2 actually complexed with its normal cdk1 or cdk2 partner, immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis was performed using total heart lysates (Fig. 2E). Both cyclin A2-cdk1 and cyclin A2-cdk2 complexes were clearly detected at PN14 in transgenic hearts but never in controls. Cyclin A2-cdk2 complex was still detected at 2 months in transgenic hearts but not in controls. To assess the activity of these complexes, α-cyclin A2 immunoprecipitates were also assayed for histone H1 kinase activity. Histone H1 kinase activity was higher in transgenic hearts at PN7, PN14, and 2 months. At PN14, it was 2.0-fold higher as averaged over three independent assays performed at this stage (Fig. 2F).Potential alterations in the expression profiles of other cell cycle regulators in response to deregulated cyclin A2 were explored. Interestingly, subcellular fractionation revealed that cyclin B1, the only other mitotic cyclin, was expressed in nuclear extracts of PN7 transgenic hearts in a more robust manner than in cytoplasmic extracts, whereas in the controls, cyclin B1 was detectable only in cytoplasmic extracts (Fig. 2G). Comparable amounts of cdk1-cyclin B1 complexes were noted in both transgenic and control heart protein extracts at PN7 and PN14 (Fig. 2H). There was no change in the levels of the cdk inhibitor p21 in transgenic versus control hearts at all stages examined (Fig. 2I). However, p27 was significantly up-regulated (Fig. 2J, average for three immunoblots: 2.97-fold at PN7, 1.55-fold at PN14, and 1.48-fold at 2 m"
https://openalex.org/W2004047341,"Studies of the properties of synaptic transmission have been carried out at only a few synapses. We analyzed exocytosis from rod photoreceptors with a combination of physiological and ultrastructural techniques. As at other ribbon synapses, we found that rods exhibited rapid kinetics of release, and the number of vesicles in the releasable pool is comparable to the number of vesicles tethered at ribbon-style active zones. However, unlike other previously studied neurons, we identified a highly Ca(2+)-sensitive pool of releasable vesicles with a relatively shallow relationship between the rate of exocytosis and [Ca(2+)](i) that is nearly linear over a presumed physiological range of intraterminal [Ca(2+)]. The low-order [Ca(2+)] dependence of release promotes a linear relationship between Ca(2+) entry and exocytosis that permits rods to relay information about small changes in illumination with high fidelity at the first synapse in vision."
https://openalex.org/W2005935748,"The Baz/Par-3-Par-6-aPKC complex is an evolutionarily conserved cassette critical for the development of polarity in epithelial cells, neuroblasts, and oocytes. aPKC is also implicated in long-term synaptic plasticity in mammals and the persistence of memory in flies, suggesting a synaptic function for this cassette. Here we show that at Drosophila glutamatergic synapses, aPKC controls the formation and structure of synapses by regulating microtubule (MT) dynamics. At the presynapse, aPKC regulates the stability of MTs by promoting the association of the MAP1Brelated protein Futsch to MTs. At the postsynapse, aPKC regulates the synaptic cytoskeleton by controlling the extent of Actin-rich and MT-rich areas. In addition, we show that Baz and Par-6 are also expressed at synapses and that their synaptic localization depends on aPKC activity. Our findings establish a novel role for this complex during synapse development and provide a cellular context for understanding the role of aPKC in synaptic plasticity and memory."
https://openalex.org/W2026007913,"BRCA1 is a major player in the DNA damage response. This is evident from its loss, which causes cells to become sensitive to a wide variety of DNA damaging agents. The major BRCA1 binding partner, BARD1, is also implicated in the DNA damage response, and recent reports indicate that BRCA1 and BARD1 co-operate in this pathway. In this report, we utilized small interfering RNA to deplete BRCA1 and BARD1 to demonstrate that the BRCA1-BARD1 complex is required for ATM/ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated/ATM and Rad3-related)-mediated phosphorylation of p53Ser-15 following IR- and UV radiation-induced DNA damage. In contrast, phosphorylation of a number of other ATM/ATR targets including H2AX, Chk2, Chk1, and c-jun does not depend on the presence of BRCA1-BARD1 complexes. Moreover, prior ATM/ATR-dependent phosphorylation of BRCA1 at Ser-1423 or Ser-1524 regulates the ability of ATM/ATR to phosphorylate p53Ser-15 efficiently. Phosphorylation of p53Ser-15 is necessary for an IR-induced G1/S arrest via transcriptional induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. Consistent with these data, repressing p53Ser-15 phosphorylation by BRCA1-BARD1 depletion compromises p21 induction and the G1/S checkpoint arrest in response to IR but not UV radia-tion. These findings suggest that BRCA1-BARD1 complexes act as an adaptor to mediate ATM/ATR-directed phosphorylation of p53, influencing G1/S cell cycle progression after DNA damage.

Damage to genetic material, which occurs as a consequence of exposure to environmental genotoxins or the byproducts of oxidative metabolism, represents a ubiquitous and persistent threat to genomic integrity. In eukaryotes and prokaryotes alike, the deleterious effects of genotoxic stress are countered by a robust DNA damage response pathway that monitors the genome for the presence of abnormal DNA structures, including single-stranded DNA, DNA double strand breaks, and chemically modified DNA bases. The DNA damage response can be reduced to detection, signal transduction, and effector phases, which are analogous to the signaling paradigms of growth factors and their cognate receptors. In mammals, the ATM 1The abbreviations used are: ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated; ATR, ATM and Rad3-related; A-T, ataxia-telangiectasia; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; IR, ionizing radiation; UVC, ultraviolet light wave-length band C; siRNA, small interfering RNA; Gy, gray (unit of measure); GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated; ATR, ATM and Rad3-related; A-T, ataxia-telangiectasia; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; IR, ionizing radiation; UVC, ultraviolet light wave-length band C; siRNA, small interfering RNA; Gy, gray (unit of measure); GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) protein kinases function as critical regulators of the cellular DNA damage response (1Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Google Scholar, 2Khanna K.K. Jackson S.P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 247-254Google Scholar). ATM and ATR are Ser/Thr-Gln-directed protein kinases with overlapping substrate specificities that are activated in response to distinct, as well as partially overlapping, types of genotoxic stimuli (1Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Google Scholar, 2Khanna K.K. Jackson S.P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 247-254Google Scholar). Despite their structural similarity and overlapping substrate specificities, ATM and ATR are functionally nonredundant protein kinases, and this is most convincingly demonstrated by comparing their respective gene knock-out phenotypes. In humans, inactivating mutations in ATM result in the cancer predisposition/neurodegeneration syndrome ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) (3Shiloh Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 71-77Google Scholar). Cells from A-T patients or ATM-nullizygous mice are exquisitely sensitive to ionizing radiation (IR) and other agents that induce double strand breaks and fail to activate the IR-induced G1/S or G2/M checkpoints. In addition, A-T cells exhibit radioresistant DNA synthesis, the failure to transiently down-regulate DNA replication in response to IR, which is indicative of an S-phase checkpoint defect. In contrast to ATM–/– mice, which are viable, ATR-deficient mice die early during embryogenesis, and conditional knock-out of ATR gene function in human cells leads to a loss of cellular viability (1Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Google Scholar). ATR mediates responses to a broad spectrum of genotoxic stimuli, including DNA replication inhibitors (e.g. hydroxyurea), UV radiation, IR, and agents such as cis-platinum that induce DNA interstrand cross-links. The checkpoint functions of ATM and ATR are mediated, in part, by a pair of checkpoint effector kinases termed Chk1 and Chk2/Cds1 (4Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Google Scholar). Although structurally distinct, Chk1 and Chk2 are functionally related kinases that phosphorylate an overlapping pool of cellular substrates (5O'Neill T. Giarratani L. Chen P. Iyer L. Lee C.H.

Chk1 is phosphorylated on two Ser residues (Ser-317 and Ser-345) in an ATM-dependent manner following IR (7Gatei M. Sloper K. Sorensen C. Syljuasen R. Falck J. Hobson K. Savage K. Lukas J. Zhou B.B. Bartek J. Khanna K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14806-14811Google Scholar) and in an ATR-dependent manner following cellular exposure to hydroxyurea or UV light, two classic ATR stimuli. Chk2 is inducibly phosphorylated on multiple Ser/Thr residues, including a regulatory site at Thr-68, by ATM in response to double strand breaks. Substrates for Chk1 and Chk2 include members of the Cdc25 family of protein phosphatases, which are essential for S-phase and G2/M-phase cell cycle transitions (1Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Google Scholar). Like ATM and ATR, Chk1 and Chk2 are nonredundant protein kinases that regulate distinct and partially overlapping cellular responses to genotoxic stimuli (8Bartek J. Lukas J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 421-429Google Scholar). Although essential for transmission of DNA damage signals, the ATM/ATR and Chk1/Chk2 kinases are not sufficient for checkpoint signaling to occur. Genetic studies using budding and fission yeast have identified gene products that participate in the initiation and propagation of checkpoint signals (4Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Google Scholar, 9O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. Carr A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 296-303Google Scholar). A critical element of the DNA damage-signaling network is the DNA replication factor C-related protein, Rad17. Studies in yeasts and human cells indicated that Rad17 interacts genetically and biochemically with a heterotrimeric complex of proteins consisting of Rad9, Rad1, and Hus1 (Rad9 complex). The Rad9 complex is structurally, and presumably functionally, related to the PCNA sliding clamp, leading to the hypothesis that hRad17-replication factor C functions as a clamp loader for the Rad9 complex at or near sites of DNA damage (10Thelen M.P. Venclovas C. Fidelis K. Cell. 1999; 96: 769-770Google Scholar). Recently, Rad17 has been shown to be required for recruitment of Rad9 complex on damaged DNA and for ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 after IR (11Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Google Scholar). Another protein with a putative adaptor/scaffolding function is the tumor suppressor, BRCA1. BRCA1 is a phosphoprotein that is mutated in ∼50% of familial breast and ovarian cancers (12Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K. Tavtigian S. Liu Q. Cochran C. Bennett L.M. Ding W. Bell R. Rosenthal J. Hussey C. Tran T. McClure M. Frye C. Hattier T. Phelps R. Haugen-Strano A. Katcher H. Yakumo K. Gholami Z. Shaffer D. Stone S. Bayer S. Wray C. Bogden R. Dayananth P. Ward J. Tonin P. Narod S. Bristow P.K. Norris F.H. Helvering L. Morrison P. Rosteck P. Lai M. Barrett J.C. Lewis C. Neuhausen S. Cannon-Albright L. Goldgar D. Wiseman R. Kamb A. Skolnick M.H. Science. 1994; 266: 66-71Google Scholar). BRCA1 is phosphorylated by ATM and ATR on multiple Ser/Thr residues in response to genotoxic stimuli (13Cortez D. Wang Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1162-1166Google Scholar, 14Gatei M. Zhou B.B. Hobson K. Scott S. Young D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17276-17280Google Scholar), as well as by Chk2 (15Lee J.S. Collins K.M. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Chung J.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 201-204Google Scholar). BRCA1 contains a BRCT motif that is found in a variety of DNA repair and checkpoint proteins (16Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Google Scholar), including budding yeast ScRad9p. ScRad9p mediates interaction between the ATM/ATR ortholog ScMec1p and its downstream target, the Chk2 ortholog ScRad53p (17Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 129-136Google Scholar). The adaptor function of Rad9 is dependent upon prior phosphorylation by ScMec1p. BRCA1 is an ATM/ATR target (14Gatei M. Zhou B.B. Hobson K. Scott S. Young D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17276-17280Google Scholar). Therefore, based on this analogy, it is conceivable that ATM/ATR-dependent phosphorylation of BRCA1 generates binding sites for BRCA1-associated factors, which are ATM/ATR substrates. Consistent with this theory, BRCA1 in cells exists as a part of a complex known as BASC (BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex), which contains many of the known ATM targets including NBS1, BLM, and SMC1 (18Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Google Scholar). BRCA1 is almost always found complexed with BARD1 in vivo. Based on these studies, we investigated whether BRCA1-BARD1 complexes are required for phosphorylation of ATM/ATR targets after exposure of cells to IR and UV radiation. The present study demonstrates that BRCA1-BARD1 dimers are required for efficient phosphorylation of p53 after exposure of cells to IR and UV radiation, respectively. Furthermore, ATM and ATR-dependent phosphorylation of BRCA1 is necessary for its adaptor function. Consequently, we show that the BRCA1-BARD1 complex is required for a G1/S arrest following IR but not UV radiation. These findings highlight the role of the BRCA1-BARD1 complex as an important mediator in the DNA damage response, affecting checkpoint function.

U2OS is a human osteosarcoma cell line, and MCF-7 is a human breast carcinoma cell line. HeLa is a human cervical carcinoma cell line. HCC1937 is a human breast carcinoma cell line harboring a pathogenic hemizygous mutation in BRCA1 (19Tomlinson G.E. Chen T.T. Stastny V.A. Virmani A.K. Spillman M.A. Tonk V. Blum J.L. Schneider N.R.

These cells have been stably transfected with pcDNA vector, pcDNA-BRCA1wt, or pcDNA-BRCA1S1423A/S1524A to generate three cell lines as described previously (20Zhang J. Willers H. Feng Z. Ghosh J.C.

All cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were seeded onto 15-cm2 dishes and transfected at 50–60% confluence with 15 μg of plasmid DNA by electroporation for immunoblotting. For immunofluorescence studies, a portion of the cells was taken from the above samples and cytospun onto slides prior to lysis. Alternatively, cells were seeded onto coverslips and transfected at 50–60% confluence with 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For flow cytometry analysis, cells were seeded onto 6-cm2 dishes and transfected at 50–60% confluence with 5 μg of plasmid DNA with LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were analyzed 72 h post-transfection. When required, cells were either irradiated with a 137Cs γ-ray source or exposed to UVC. Plasmid Construction—The BRCA1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) construct was generated by annealing the following complementary oligonucleotides and inserted into the pSuper vector as a BglII/HindIII fragment: forward, 5′-G ATC CCC GAA AGT ACG AGA TTT AGT CTT CAA GAG AGA CTA AAT CTC GTA CTT TCT TTT TGG AAA-3′, and reverse, 5′-AG CTT TTC CAA AAA GAA AGT ACG AGA TTT AGT CTC TCT TGA AGA CTA AAT CTC GTA CTT TCG GG-3′.

The oligonucleotides used to generate the GFP siRNA construct were as follows: forward, 5′-GAT CCC GCT GGA GTA CAA CTA CAA CTT CAA GAG AGT TGT AGT TGT ACT CCA GCT TTT GGA AA-3′, and reverse, 5′-TT TCC AAA AGC TGG AGT ACA ACT ACA ACT CTC TTG AAG TTG TAG TTG TAG TTG TAC TCC AGC GGG ATC-3′. The nucleotides in boldface indicate the regions of BRCA1, BARD1, and GFP that were targeted for silencing by siRNA. Full-length wild-type YFP-tagged BRCA1 has been described previously (21Rodriguez J.A. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38589-38596Google Scholar). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to introduce alanine point mutations into the YFP-BRCA1 construct to disrupt the DNA damage-induced phosphorylation sites: Ser-1387, Ser-1423, and Ser-1524. To mutate residue serine 1387 to alanine, the following primers were used: forward, 5′-TCA GGG CTA TCC GCT CAG AGT GAC ATT-3′, and reverse, 5′-AAT GTC ACT CTG AGC GGA TAG CCC TGA-3′. To mutate residue serine 1423 to alanine, the following primers were used: forward, 5′-GAA CAG CAT GGG GCC CAG CCT TCT AAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTT AGA AGG CTG GGC CCC ATG CTG TTC-3′. To mutate residue serine 1524 to alanine, the following primers were used: forward, 5′-GA AAC TAC CCA GCT CAA GAG GAG CTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GAG CTC CTC TTG AGC TGG GTA GTT TC-3′. The codons in boldface indicate the amino acids mutated to alanine. All plasmid mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Immunoblotting—Cellular extracts were prepared by resuspending the cells in lysis buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/m1 leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.3% Nonidet P-40) and incubating on ice for 30 min. Supernatants were collected following centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The protein sample was then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies. The following primary antibodies were used: ATMSer-1981 (Rockland Diagnostic), ATM (2C-1, Genetex), p21 (Oncogene Research), Chk1Ser-317 (7Gatei M. Sloper K. Sorensen C. Syljuasen R. Falck J. Hobson K. Savage K. Lukas J. Zhou B.B. Bartek J. Khanna K.K. J. Biol.

Zhou B.B. Hobson K. Scott S. Young D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17276-17280Google Scholar), BARD1 (provided by Dr. Richard Baer), and γ-tubulin (T5192; Sigma). Antibody bound to the above proteins was detected by incubation with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma). Blotted proteins were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Markers (Bio-Rad) were used as molecular size standards. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min at room temperature, washed three times in PBS, and then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS. Cells were then washed three times in PBS and blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 45 min before the required primary antibody was applied. BRCA1 was detected with a monoclonal antibody Ab-1 (Oncogene Research) followed by incubation with fluorescein-labeled antimouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.. The phosphospecific antibodies p53Ser-15 (Cell Signaling) and H2AXSer-139 (Upstate Biotechnology) were used to detect the phosphorylation status of p53 and H2AX, respectively. Antibody bound to p53Ser-15 or H2AXSer-139 was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Cell nuclei were counterstained with the chromosome dye Hoechst 33285 (Sigma). After extensive washing, samples were mounted onto glass slides with a drop of Vectashield anti-fade mounting reagent (Vector Laboratories). Samples were analyzed with an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus). Images were captured digitally and processed with Adobe Photoshop. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Incorporation Assay—Cells were mock irradiated or exposed to 6 Gy of IR or 50 J/m2 UVC. After 16 h, cells were pulsed by 20 mm BrdUrd for 30 min and then harvested by washing with PBS. Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol at –20 °C for at least 1 h. After fixation, the cells were washed with 1% fetal calf serum, PBS and then treated with 2 m HCl containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. The acid was neutralized by resuspending the cell pellet in 0.1 m sodium tetraborate (pH 8.5) and incubating at room temperature for 5 min. Following centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of wash/stain buffer (1% fetal calf serum, 0.5% Tween 20, PBS) and then 10 μl of anti-BrdUrd-FITC antibody (BD Biosciences). Cells were incubated in the dark for 30 min and then washed twice in wash/stain buffer before being stained with 25 μg of propidium iodide/ml and 0.1 mg of RNase A/ml in PBS. Cellular fluorescence was measured by a BD Biosciences FACS Calibur flow cytometer. The data were analyzed using CellQuest software. BRCA1 and BARD1 Require Heterodimerization to Maintain Stability—BRCA1 predominantly is found complexed in vivo with its major binding partner, BARD1 (22Baer R. Ludwig T. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 2002; 12: 86-91Google Scholar). These proteins co-localize in nuclear foci during S-phase (23Jin Y. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Wei F. Ayi T.-C. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12075-12080Google Scholar) and following exposure to DNA-damaging agents relocate to sites of DNA repair (24Celeste A. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Kruhlak M.J. Pilch D.R. Staudt D.W. Lee A. Bonner R.F. Bonner W.M. Nussenzweig A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 675-679Google Scholar). Furthermore, they co-fractionate in various DNA repair-associated nuclear complexes (25Chiba N. Parvin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38549-38554Google Scholar), implicating the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer in the DNA damage response. Previous studies have demonstrated that the stability of BRCA1 is dependent on the expression of BARD1 and vice versa (26Joukov V. Chen J. Fox E.A. Green J.B. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12078-12083Google Scholar, 27Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to confirm these data by using siRNA to specifically inhibit the expression of either BRCA1 or BARD1 in cells. 293T cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting BRCA1 and GFP. Immunoblotting results show that only BRCA1 siRNA specifically decreased BRCA1 expression with or without prior exposure of cells to IR (10 Gy) or UV (50 J/m2). In contrast, GFP siRNA had no apparent effect (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained by immunostaining (Fig. 2C). Consistent with published data, BARD1 levels were reduced in BRCA1 siRNA transfected cells compared with control transfected cells (Fig. 1A, GFP siRNA). The same phenomenon applied to BARD1 siRNA, i.e. 293T cells transfected with BARD1 siRNA not only specifically reduced BARD1 expression but also repressed BRCA1 expression, whereas GFP siRNA had no effect on either protein (Fig. 1B). These findings indicate that BRCA1-BARD1 complex formation is essential for mutual stability.Fig. 2BRCA1-BARD1 complexes mediate ATM/ATR-dependent phosphorylation of p53Ser-15 following DNA damage. A, cellular extracts were obtained from 293T cells transfected with siRNAs targeting either GFP or BRCA1 in the absence or presence of irradiation at 1 h after exposure to 10 Gy IR or 50 J/m2 UV light. The level of Cdc25A was analyzed by Western blotting. The phosphorylation of the indicated residues within the ATM/ATR substrates p53, Chk2, Chk1, and c-jun was also examined using phosphospecific antibodies. Chk1 phosphorylation was also assessed in C3ABR lymphoblastoid cells with (+) and without (–) prior exposure to ionizing radiation (10 Gy). B, 293T cells were transfected with either GFP or BARD1 siRNAs. At 72 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 10 Gy IR or 50 J/m2 UV light and were then incubated for 1 h. Cellular extracts were obtained and immunoblotted for p53 and Chk2 phosphorylation using phosphospecific antibodies against the indicated residues. The expression of Cdc25A was also assessed by immunoblotting. C, 293T cells were transfected and exposed to DNA-damaging agents as described in A. At 72 h post-transfection cells were immunostained for BRCA1 levels using an anti-BRCA1 antibody and for the phosphorylation status of p53 using the p53Ser-15 phosphospecific antibody. Microscopy images demonstrate that p53Ser-15 phosphorylation is repressed in cells lacking BRCA1 expression. D, 293T cells were transfected and treated as described in A and then immunostained with a H2AX phosphospecific antibody (H2AXSer-139). In contrast to the effect of p53Ser-15 phosphorylation, DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of H2AXSer-139 was not affected by the loss of BRCA1 expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) ATM is the primary signal transducer in response to DNA double strand breaks caused by exposure to IR. A recent paper illustrated that ATM is activated by autophosphorylation on Ser-1981 in response to IR (28Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Google Scholar). Therefore, to confirm that BRCA1-BARD1 complexes do not disrupt ATM activity directly or indirectly, we immunoblotted GFP, BRCA1, and BARD1 siRNA cellular extracts with a Ser-1981 phosphospecific antibody as a marker of ATM activity in cells. As expected, ATMSer-1981 phosphorylation was markedly increased following exposure to IR, but not UV radiation, in control transfected cells (Fig. 1, GFP siRNA). Importantly, phosphorylation of ATMSer-1981 was not decreased by the depletion of BRCA1 and BARD1 in cells transfected with siRNAs targeting these proteins (see Fig. 1). In contrast, IR-induced phosphorylation of ATM at Ser-1981 was slightly increased in BRCA1 and BARD1 siRNA-transfected cells relative to control cells (GFP siRNA), indicating that BRCA1-BARD1 complexes may set a threshold for ATM autophosphorylation in response to IR. These findings indicate that BRCA1-BARD1 complexes are not required for the activation of ATM. BRCA1-BARD1 Complexes Are Required for ATM/ATR-dependent Phosphorylation of p53Ser-15—Previous work from our laboratory and those of others (14Gatei M. Zhou B.B. Hobson K. Scott S. Young D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17276-17280Google Scholar, 29Tibbetts R.S. Cortez D. Brumbaugh K.M. Scully R. Livingston D. Elledge S.J. Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2989-3002Google Scholar) has shown that although ATM and ATR phosphorylate the same set of targets in vitro, functionally they are nonredundant kinases in vivo. Rapid IR-induced phosphorylation of downstream targets are catalyzed by ATM in vivo, whereas ATR mediates rapid UVC-induced phosphorylation events. BRCA1 has been shown to bind many ATM/ATR targets as a component of BASC (BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex) (18Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Google Scholar). To address whether the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer is required for the phosphorylation of ATM/ATR targets, we used siRNA to specifically inhibit the expression of BRCA1 and BARD1 in cells. By immunoblotting we examined the phosphorylation status of p53 (anti-p53Ser-15), Chk2 (anti-Chk2Thr-68), and c-jun (anti-c-JunSer-63) in BRCA1, BARD1, and GFP siRNA-transfected cells before and after exposure to IR (10 Gy) and UV radiation (50 J/m2). In cells transfected with GFP siRNA, phosphorylation of p53 and c-jun increased following exposure to IR and UV radiation, whereas phosphorylation of Chk2 only increased after IR (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the IR- and UV-induced increase in p53 phosphorylation was significantly less in BRCA1 and BARD1 siRNA-transfected cells after DNA damage (Fig. 2, A and B). Similar results were obtained by immunostaining (Fig. 2C). In contrast, Chk2 and c-jun phosphorylation was not affected by the loss of BRCA1 and BARD1 expression (Fig. 2, A and B). The effect of Chk1 phosphorylation (anti-Chk1Ser-317) was also assessed in GFP and BRCA1 siRNA-transfected cells in the absence and presence of DNA-damaging agents. As expected, Chk1Ser-317 phosphorylation increased following exposure to UV radiation in control transfected cells (Fig. 2A, GFP siRNA). Interestingly, Chk1Ser-317 phosphorylation was not affected in cells depleted of BRCA1 (Fig. 2A). It should be noted that publications from our laboratory and others (7Gatei M. Sloper K. Sorensen C. Syljuasen R. Falck J. Hobson K. Savage K. Lukas J. Zhou B.B. Bartek J. Khanna K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14806-14811Google Scholar, 40Sorensen C.S. Syljuasen R.G. Falk J. Schroeder T. Ronnstrand L. Khanna K.K. Zouh B.B. Bartek J. Lukas J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 247-258Google Scholar) have shown that phosphorylation of Chk1Ser-317 is increased following IR in a number of lymphoblastoid cell lines in an ATM-dependent manner; however, we did not observe an increase in Chk1Ser-317 phosphorylation in 293T cells following IR (Fig. 2A). In contrast, as a positive control, we demonstrate that Chk1Ser-317 phosphorylation is markedly increased 1 h post-IR in C3ABR lymphoblastoid cells (Fig. 2A). A recent publication (30Okubo E. Lehman J.M. Friedrich T.D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1257-1267Google Scholar) has demonstrated that SV40 transformation can interfere with Chk1 phosphorylation, which would provide an explanation as to why we did not observe an increase in this phosphorylation event in 293T cells. Cdc25A is a downstream target of the Chk1 and Chk2 kinases. Both kinases can mediate the phosphorylation of Cdc25A, stimulating its degradation and resulting in activation of the S-phase checkpoint (31Xiao Z. Chen Z. Gunasekera A.H. Sowin T.J. Rosenberg S.H. Fesik S. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21767-21773Google Scholar). Therefore, Cdc25A expression was analyzed in GFP, BRCA1, and BARD1 siRNA-transfected cells. As expected, Cdc25A expression decreased in GFP siRNA-transfected cells following DNA damage compared with untreated cells. Consistent with our findings on Chk1/Chk2 phosphorylation, Cdc25A degradation was not affected by the loss of BRCA1 and BARD1 expression (Fig. 2, A and B). We conclude that BRCA1-BARD1 dimers are required for ATM/ATR-dependent phosphorylation of p53Ser-15 in response to DNA damage but are dispensable for phosphorylation of various other ATM/ATR targets.

Productive cadherin-based cell recognition is characterized by a distinct morphological process of contact zone extension, where limited initial points of adhesion are progressively expanded into broad zones of contact. We recently demonstrated that E-cadherin ligation recruits the Arp2/3 actin nucleator complex to the plasma membrane in regions where cell contacts are undergoing protrusion and extension. This suggested that Arp2/3 might generate the protrusive forces necessary for cell surfaces to extend upon one another during contact assembly. We tested this hypothesis in mammalian cells by exogenously expressing the CA region of N-WASP. This fragment, which potently inhibits Arp2/3-mediated actin assembly in vitro, also effectively reduced actin assembly at cadherin adhesive contacts. Blocking Arp2/3 activity by this strategy profoundly reduced the ability of cells to extend cadherin adhesive contacts but did not affect cell adhesiveness. These findings demonstrate that Arp2/3 activity is necessary for cells to efficiently extend and assemble cadherin-based adhesive contacts.

Classical cadherin adhesion molecules are fundamental determinants of tissue organization (1Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar, 2Tepass U. Troung K. Godt D. Ikura M. Peifer M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). These cell surface receptors participate in morphogenesis and cellular patterning during development and support tissue homeostasis in post-embryonic life. Conversely, loss of cadherin function contributes to a number of disease states; notably, E-cadherin dys-function promotes invasion and metastasis of epithelial tumors (3Birchmeier W. Behrens J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar).The morphogenetic effect of classical cadherins requires, but may not be solely due to, the adhesive binding properties of the cadherin ectodomain. Detailed analysis of epithelial biogenesis in cultured cells indicates that productive cadherin-based cell recognition is accompanied by a distinct morphological process of contact zone extension, where limited initial cell-cell adhesions are progressively expanded into broad zones of contact (4Adams C.L.

It is becoming increasingly evident that contact zone extension involves the active coordination of cell surface adhesion, the actin cytoskeleton, and cell signaling pathways (8Yap A.S. Kovacs E.M.

Elucidating the precise way in which each of these mechanisms supports contact zone extension is therefore likely to provide necessary insights into the cellular processes that convert initial binding of cadherin ectodomains into productive adhesive recognition.It has long been recognized that classical cadherins function in cooperation with the actin cytoskeleton (1Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar, 9Adams C.L. Nelson W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, this cooperativity is likely to take several forms, including scaffolding of adhesion complexes onto cortical actin filaments and contractility of actin bundles (6Vaezi A. Bauer C. Vasioukhin V. Fuchs E. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 9Adams C.L. Nelson W.J. Curr. Opin.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1227-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The extension of cells upon one another would seem to also require a mechanism for protrusive force to be generated at initial nascent contacts. De novo assembly of actin filaments is one well established mechanism to support such protrusive activity (11Bear J.E. Krause M. Gertler F.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 12Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3234) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent studies (7Vasioukhin V. Bauer C. Yin M. Fuchs E. Cell. 2000; 100: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar, 13Lambert M. Choquet D. Mege R.M. J.

Biol. 2002; 12: 379-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) have shown that actin assembly occurs at sites of cadherin adhesion, particularly where initial contact zones are being made and are undergoing extension. Such actin assembly can potentially support both the protrusive force necessary to bring cells together in the first place and also the forces required to extend those initial contacts into mature zones of adhesion.The Arp2/3 complex is currently the best understood molecular determinant of actin assembly (12Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3234) Google Scholar). A stable complex of seven highly conserved proteins that mediates many forms of signal-regulated actin assembly at cell membranes, Arp2/3 catalyzes the energetically unfavorable step of actin nucleation, leading to the growth of actin filaments. We recently demonstrated that E-cadherin homophilic ligation is sufficient to recruit the Arp2/3 complex to the plasma membrane, and, indeed, Arp2/3 and E-cadherin interact to form a biochemical complex (14Kovacs E.M. Goodwin M. Ali R.G. Paterson A.D. Yap A.S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 379-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Characteristically, Arp2/3 was recruited to newly forming cadherin contacts where contact zones were being extended. This suggested the attractive hypothesis that Arp2/3 could generate protrusive forces to drive extension of nascent contacts upon one another. As a first step toward assessing this hypothesis, we sought to determine how inhibiting Arp2/3 activity might affect cadherin function. By using a fragment of N-WASP that acts as a potent dominant inhibitor in vitro (15Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar), we now report that Arp2/3-mediated actin assembly is necessary for efficient cadherin contact formation but has a less marked influence on cell surface adhesiveness.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids—To generate pIRESpuro-hECad, hEcad/pcDNA3 (a kind gift from Drs. Cara Gottardi and Barry Gumbiner) (16Gottardi C.J. Wong E. Gumbiner B.M. J.

Commun. 2000; 272: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), with an N-terminal EGFP 1The abbreviations used are: EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ConA, concanavalin A; TIRF, total internal reflection fluorescence. tag substituted for the FLAG tag. pEGFP-CA was digested with NheI and XbaI, and the coding sequence fragment was subcloned into pUHD10-3-hygromycin (a kind gift from Dr. C. Gottardi) digested with XbaI to yield pUHD10-3 Hygro/EGFP-CA.Cell Culture and Protein Purification—To generate CHO cell lines containing both E-cadherin and the Tet-OFF transcriptional regulator, CHO-AA8 cell lines stably expressing the Tet-OFF transcriptional regulator (Clontech) were transfected with pIRESpuro-hEcad using LipofectAMINE (as per the manufacturer's instructions). Individual clones (hE-CHO/Tet cells) were picked and expanded after incubation with puromycin (10 μg/ml). Lines were chosen that showed E-cadherin expression at levels (by Western blotting) similar to those observed in MCF-7 cells (not shown) as well as CHO-Tk lines stably expressing human E-cadherin (18Kovacs E.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 6708-6718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar).hE-CHO/Tet cells were then co-transfected by lipofection with pUHD10-3 Hygro/EGFP-CA. Initial selection was conducted in the presence of doxycycline (1 μg/ml) and hygromycin (200 μg/ml). Hygromycin-resistant clones were picked and expanded in the absence of doxycycline to induce expression of EGFP-CA. EGFP-expressing populations were then collected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and subcloned. MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. hE/Fc was prepared and purified as described previously (14Kovacs E.M. Goodwin M. Ali R.G.

Species-specific secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes. F-actin was identified with TRITC-phalloidin (Sigma).Adhesion Assays—Laminar flow detachment adhesion assays were performed as described previously (14Kovacs E.M. Goodwin M. Ali R.G. Paterson A.D. Yap A.S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 379-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Longer term detachment assays were performed as described previously (21Goodwin M. Kovacs E.M. Thoreson M.A. Reynolds A.B. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20533-20539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) with modifications. In brief, nitrocellulose-coated 6-well plates were incubated with hE/Fc (in Hanks' balanced salt solution, HBSS, containing 5 mm CaCl2) overnight at 4 °C, and then blocked with bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml, 2 h, 4 °C). Cells were isolated by incubation for 10 min in 0.01% (w/v) crystalline trypsin (Sigma) in HBSS containing 5 mm CaCl2. Freshly isolated cells were allowed to attach to the substrata for 90 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator and were then subjected to detachment by systematic pipetting. For this, five regions in each well (the four quadrants and center) were washed twice with 200 μl of HBSS/CaCl2 delivered using a stand-mounted pipette. Cells remaining adherent to the wells were then incubated with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (10 mg/ml) dissolved in Me2SO and read at A595 in a microplate reader. Cellular content in wells after pipetting was compared with the cellular content of wells prepared under identical conditions but was not subjected to pipetting (yielding the total number of cells plated in each well). Cell aggregation assays (22Yap A.S. Niessen C. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) and hE/Fc-coated bead assays (21Goodwin M. Kovacs E.M. Thoreson M.A. Reynolds A.B. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20533-20539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) were performed as described previously.To quantitate cell extension on hE/Fc-coated substrata, phalloidin stained images were analyzed using Metamorph (version 5.0; Universal Imaging). The outer margins of cadherin-based lamellipodia were identified by their characteristic broad pattern of phalloidin staining. For each cell the lengths of each outer margin were measured and summed, and the total length of the outer margins was expressed as a percentage of the perimeter of that cell (lamellipodial index). Cell contact formation following manipulation of extracellular calcium was quantitated in E-cadherin-stained specimens as described previously (19Helwani F.M. Kovacs E.M. Paterson A.D. Verma S. Ali R.G. Fanning A.S. Weed S.A. Yap A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).Actin Accumulation Assay—Actin accumulation at cadherin-coated or ConA-coated beads was measured by quantifying fluorescence intensity of phalloidin-stained specimens using Image J (version 1.30). Images of phalloidin staining were taken in the plane of adhesion of the beads, and care was taken to ensure that all pixel values were within the linear range of the cameras. For each cell the region of phalloidin staining immediately adjacent to, and extending from, the beads was manually identified using the region of interest function in Image J. To correct for background actin staining, independent of adhesive binding, the average pixel intensity in a region of the surface clearly separate from the beads was measured, and this was then subtracted from each individual pixel value in the sample. The mean corrected pixel intensity and number of pixels within the region of interest was then measured, and the product of these was used as an index of phalloidin accumulation.G-actin Incorporation Assay—Incorporation of Alexa 568-labeled G-actin (Molecular Probes) into saponin-permeabilized cells was performed as described previously (14Kovacs E.M. Goodwin M. Ali R.G. Paterson A.D. Yap A.S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 379-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Quantification of G-actin incorporation at cell-cell contacts of MDCK cells was performed with Metamorph (Universal Imaging), using epi-illumination images taken with identical exposures and camera settings. Fluorescence intensity at cell-cell contacts was assessed by measuring the mean intensity in 12 × 12 pixel boxed regions placed at cell-cell contacts. To correct for inter-sample variation and photobleaching, fluorescence intensity at contacts between microinjected test cells was normalized to the fluorescence intensity in contacts between uninjected cells within the same coverslip.Microscopy—Epi-illumination fluorescence microscopy of fixed specimens was performed using Olympus AX70 or IX81 microscopes equipped ×100, 1.40 NA objectives. Images were acquired with Hamamatsu Orca I or Orca I-ER cameras driven by Metamorph software version 5.0 (Universal Imaging). Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy was performed using an Olympus IX81 microscope and ×60, 1.45 NA objective illuminated with a 10-milliwatt argon laser (Milles-Griot). For live cell microscopy, cells were maintained in a water-jacketed incubation chamber at 37 °C. Background correction and contrast adjustment of raw images were performed in either Adobe Photoshop (version 7) or ImageJ (version 1.30). Panels were assembled in Adobe Photoshop.RESULTSGeneration of Cells Inducibly Expressing the CA Domain of N-WASP—To inhibit specifically Arp2/3 activity in cells, we utilized an EGFP fusion protein bearing the C-terminal domains of N-WASP (EGFP-CA), a fragment that potently inhibited Arp2/3 activity in vitro (15Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar) blocked Rac-induced ruffling in vivo (17Sasaki N. Miki H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). CHO-AA8 cells stably co-expressing the Tet-OFF transregulator and human E-cadherin (hE-CHO/Tet cells) were transfected with pTRE2-EGFP-CA, where the EGFP-CA coding region is placed under control of the Tet promoter. Selection-resistant clonal lines expressing EGFP-CA (hE-CHO/Tet-CA cells) were picked by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and subcloned. Low levels of EGFP-CA were detectable by immunoblotting (but not by immunofluorescence) in uninduced cells, but expression increased considerably after doxycycline was removed from the media (Fig. 1A), typically peaking after ∼3 days.Induction of EGFP-CA did not affect the total cellular levels of E-cadherin, β-, α-, or p120-catenin compared with either uninduced cells or with hE-CHO/Tet cells not transfected with EGFP-CA (Fig. 1B). The surface level of E-cadherin was also not affected by EGFP-CA as assessed by the proportion of cellular E-cadherin susceptible to surface trypsinization (Fig. 1C). Immunofluorescence microscopy of cell monolayers demonstrated that E-cadherin localized with β-catenin and F-actin to cell-cell contacts in uninduced hE-CHO/Tet-CA cells (Fig. 2). Some E-cadherin and β-catenin staining was also seen where cells induced to express EGFP-CA formed contacts with each other. However, the contacts between induced cells appeared less extensive than in uninduced cells, typically being more punctate and ragged. Similarly, relatively little phalloidin staining was observed at the cell contacts in EGFP-CA-induced cells compared with the more intense F-actin seen in contacts between uninduced cells. These observations suggested that expression of EGFP-CA might affect the ability of cells to establish contacts with one another, although the cellular levels of E cadherin and catenins were unaffected.Fig. 2Morphology of cell-cell contacts in cells expressing EGFP-CA. Monolayers of hE-CHO/Tet-CA cells incubated in the presence of doxycycline (1 μg/ml; Uninduced; A, C, and E) or 3 days after withdrawal of doxycycline (Induced; B, D, and F) were fixed and immunostained for E-cadherin (A and B), β-catenin (C and D), or F-actin (phalloidin, E and F).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of EGFP-CA Inhibits Cadherin-directed Actin Assembly—Although the CA fragment of N-WASP has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of Arp2/3-mediated actin assembly in vitro (15Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar), it was important for us to test whether inducible expression of this fragment could inhibit cadherin-directed actin assembly in cells. Phalloidin staining in cell monolayers suggested that this might be the case, because F-actin bundles and actin-rich structures were less prominent in cells induced to express EGFP-CA than in uninduced cells (Fig. 2). To address this more directly, however, we wished to determine whether EGFP-CA affected the ability of cadherin adhesion alone to induce actin assembly at adhesive contacts. For this purpose we first used latex beads coated with recombinant cadherin ligands to present spatially confined homophilic adhesive signals that can recruit Arp2/3 and induce actin assembly (13Lambert M.

In these experiments we employed a dimeric ligand consisting of the complete ectodomain of human E-cadherin fused to the Fc region of IgG (hE/Fc). This and similar recombinant proteins (13Lambert M.

Characteristically, phalloidin stained densely in the immediate vicinity of the beads and extended outward on the dorsal surfaces of the cells. No accumulation of either F-actin or E-cadherin was observed at sites of adhesion to ConA-coated beads (Fig. 3A). Induction of EGFP-CA profoundly inhibited the accumulation of actin at cadherin bead contacts. By comparison with uninduced cells, much less phalloidin staining was observed at these sites of adhesion, although cellular cadherin was recruited to the beads. This difference was confirmed when the extent of phalloidin accumulation around the beads was quantitated (Fig. 3B). This indicated that expression of EGFP-CA in cells indeed inhibited local cellular F-actin accumulation in response to cadherin homophilic signals.Fig. 3Expression of EGFP-CA inhibits actin accumulation at cadherin contacts. Latex beads coated with hE/Fc or ConA were allowed to attach for 90 min to the dorsal surfaces of hE-CHO/Tet-CA cells grown in the presence of doxycycline (1 μg/ml; Uninduced) or after withdrawal of doxycycline (Induced). Samples were fixed and stained for cellular E-cadherin or F-actin. Representative immunofluorescence images of E-cadherin or F-actin recruitment to beads are shown (A). Note that beads in uninduced cells show extensive regions of phalloidin staining around and extending from the hE/Fc beads. Phalloidin staining was much less extensive around hE/Fc beads bound to the surfaces of cells induced to express EGFP-CA, whereas ConA beads principally showed autofluorescence of the beads themselves.

Upon attachment in this assay, cadherin-containing cells progressively extend broad lamellipodia to expand their adhesive contacts. The outer margins of these lamellipodia thereby participate in contact zone extension, analogous to the pattern observed as MDCK cells extend nascent contacts upon one another (5Ehrlich J.S. Hansen M.D.H. Nelson W.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar).We had observed earlier (14Kovacs E.M. Goodwin M. Ali R.G. Paterson A.D. Yap A.S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 379-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) that the Arp2/3 complex characteristically accumulated at the outer margins of adhesive contacts as cells attached to cadherin-coated substrata. To better define the dynamics of Arp2/3 accumulation during contact zone extension, we used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to image molecular events that occur within ∼100 nm of the adhesive interface between cells and hE/Fc-coated substrata (28Steyer J.A. Almers W. Nat Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). We found that GFP-Arp3 clearly localized at the very outer margins as adhesive contacts were extending (Fig. 4A and supplemental Movie 1) but was often lost from those regions undergoing transient retraction. This extended our earlier observations to indicate that Arp2/3 concentrates at the cell cortex in regions of adhesion where contacts are actively extending. Furthermore, TIRF imaging of fixed specimens revealed that although the p34 subunit of the Arp2/3 complex stained prominently at the very outer margins of cadherin-based lamellipodia, cellular E-cadherin was found in clusters throughout the adhesive interface (not shown). Therefore, the preferential accumulation of GFP-Arp3 at the outer margin was not because of differences in proximity between the cell surface and the glass substrate.Fig. 4EGFP-CA preferentially inhibits actin assembly in nascent contacts as cells adhere to cadherin-coated substrata.A, TIRF imaging reveals that Arp2/3 localizes at the outer margins of extending cadherin contact zones. CHO cells stably expressing human E-cadherin (hE-CHO cells) were transiently transfected with GFP-Arp3, allowed to adhere to substrata coated with hE/Fc, and visualized by TIRF. Sequential frames from a representative TIRF movie (supplemental Movie 1) show regions of cadherin-based lamellipodia undergoing dynamic extension. Note that GFP-Arp3 transiently recruits to regions of lamellipodia undergoing extension (A, arrows, asterisks) and filopodia undergoing extension (A, arrowheads).

Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Google Scholar, 3Petrelli A. Gilestro G.F. Lanzardo S. Comoglio P.M. Migone N. Giordano S. Nature. 2002; 416: 187-190Google Scholar, 4Sorkin A.D. Waters C.M. Bioessays. 1993; 6: 375-382Google Scholar, 5Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Google Scholar). Among these changes, ubiquitination seems to play a crucial role in directional targeting of activated receptors for degradation in lysosomes (1Dikic I. Giordano S. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2003; 15: 128-135Google Scholar, 2Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Google Scholar). It was proposed that the Ubligase Cbl, which associates with receptors after ligand-induced activation, mediates monoubiquitination of activated EGF and PDGF receptors on multiple sites (6Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Google Scholar, 7Mosesson Y. Shtiegman K. Katz M. Zwang Y. Vereb G. Szollosi J. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21323-21326Google Scholar). These Ub-moieties are thought to be recognized by proteins possessing Ub-binding modules that contribute to sorting of Ub-coupled cargo in the endosome (8Haglund K. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 598-603Google Scholar). For example, the yeast homologues of epsin and Eps15 have proven to be essential for Ste2p receptor internalization, and clathrin-associated epsin-Eps-15 complexes might bind ubiquitinated receptors via their ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIM), thus driving receptor internalization (9Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Hofmann K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 491-497Google Scholar, 10Shih S.C. Katzmann D.J. Schnell J.D. Sutanto M. Emr S.D. Hicke L. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: 389-393Google Scholar). Moreover, epsin and Eps15 are found on endosomal membranes complexed with other ubiquitin receptors, STAM2 and Hrs, which enables these proteins to act in concert to sort ubiquitinated proteins into the multivesicular body of the late endosome (11Bache K.G. Raiborg C. Mehlum A. Stenmark H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 27: 27Google Scholar). Inclusion of the ubiquitin-modified EGF receptors into the multivesicular body and their subsequent sorting for lysosomal degradation is additionally dependent on the Ub-binding ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 variant domain-containing protein Tsg101 (12Babst M. Odorizzi G. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. Traffic. 2000; 1: 248-258Google Scholar). How these different Cbl functions are negatively controlled under physiological conditions remains unknown. It has been suggested that Cbl-binding proteins, such as Sprouty 2, might temporally inhibit the capacity of Cbl to interact with and ubiquitinate EGF receptors (13Hall A.B. Jura N. DaSilva J. Jang Y.J. Gong D. Bar-Sagi D. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 308-314Google Scholar, 14Rubin C. Litvak V. Medvedovsky H. Zwang Y. Lev S. Yarden Y. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 297-307Google Scholar). Here we describe a new mechanism by which Cbl-mediated endocytosis and degradation of RTKs are modulated. We have identified the novel Cbl-interacting proteins Sts-1 and Sts-2, which are recruited to EGF receptors upon ligand binding. Both proteins potentially regulate interactions between trafficking receptors and the Ub-sorting machinery in the endosome, thus impairing receptor internalization and subsequent sorting for lysosomal degradation. As a result, Sts-1 and Sts-2 stabilize activated receptors and modulate growth factor-induced biological responses. Therefore, we propose that Sts-1/Sts-2 act as negative regulators of Cbl functions and modulators of biological responses elicited by RTKs. Materials, Plasmids, Cells, and Antibodies—Two different antibodies recognizing Sts-2 were generated: α-phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM) antibodies raised against GST-fused protein encompassing amino acids 908-1867 of human Sts-2 and α-992 against the peptide RGFLPENYTDRASESD beginning at amino acid 859. Sts-1-specific antibodies were kindly provided by J. Ihle and N. Carpino. Antibodies recognizing phosphotyrosine (PY99), autophosphorylated EGF receptor (phosphotyrosine 1173, anti-pEGFR), extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)2 (C14), pERK (E-4), PDGFR-β (P-20), and anti-epsin (R-20) antibodies were from Santa Cruz, mouse anti-HA (12CA5) from Roche, mouse anti-FLAG M5 antibodies were from Sigma. Anti-Cbl (RF) and anti-EGFR receptor (RK2 and 108) antibodies were used as described previously (5Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Google Scholar, 15Szymkiewicz I. Kowanetz K. Soubeyran P. Dinarina A. Lipkowitz S. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39666-39672Google Scholar). Wheat germ lectin-Sepharose was from Amersham Biosciences. EGF was purchased from Intergen, rhodamine-labeled EGF was purchased from Molecular Probes, and PDGF-BB from Amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA). Constructs for expressing EGFR, PDGFR, Cbl, CIN85, and Flag- or HA-tagged Ub have been described previously (5Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Google Scholar). The expression vectors for FLAG-Eps15, FLAG-epsin and GST-Ub were provided by S. Polo and P. P. Di Fiore. The construct for FLAG-Hrs was provided by H. Stenmark. Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (5Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Google Scholar) using the Gal4-based Matchmaker two-hybrid system (BD Biosciences Clontech). PC-12, HEK293T, COS-1, Jurkat, and HeLa cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. NIH3T3 cells were used as described previously (5Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Google Scholar). Stable expression of Sts-2 constructs in NIH3T3 cells and of EGFR in CHO cells was maintained by the presence of 1.2 mg/ml or 2.4 mg/ml of G418 in the culture medium, respectively. Where indicated, cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Thirty hours after transfection, the cells were starved for an additional 12 h and stimulated with 50 ng/ml EGF or PDGF-BB for indicated times. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation, GST-pull down assays, and immunoblotting as described previously (5Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Google Scholar, 15Szymkiewicz I. Kowanetz K. Soubeyran P. Dinarina A. Lipkowitz S. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39666-39672Google Scholar). Full-size Sts-2 cDNA was cloned from the Jurkat cell line using sequence-specific primers (Table 1). All Sts-2 and Sts-1 constructs were generated by PCR. Constructs of Sts-2 in mammalian expression vector were generated in pCDNA3-FLAG (Invitrogen), and for GST-fusion proteins, expression pGEX-4TI (Amersham Biosciences) was used as a basic vector. The primers shown in Table 1, all tagged with appropriate restriction sites, were used for subcloning.Table IPrimersPrimer nameSequenceUsed forSts-2 RTReverseagttacaaaggcgaaagcCloning of Sts-2ForwardccgctcgagatggcagcgggggagacgCloning of Sts-2UBA forwardccgaattcgccatgaccttcgccacgWT Sts-2, UBA, Δ PGMSts-2 reverseccgctcgagtcagttgcctgagatccaWT Sts-2, Δ UBA, PGMUBA reverseccgctcgaggtctcgggagtagagtgcUBAΔ UBA forwardccgctcgagtatgcccttttcctctgtΔ UBASH3*ForwardgaagccagcgagggcgcggtgattgggatctcSH3*ReversegagatcccaatcaccgcgccctcgctggcttcSH3*PGM forwardcggaattccgtgaagcacaggatgtacPGMΔ PGM reverseccgctcgaggtacatcctgtgcttcacΔ PGMSts-1ForwardccgaattcgctcagtacggccaccccWT Sts-1ReverseccgctcgagttattcttgaagcaaggtWT Sts-1Sts-1 SH3ForwardgcgggatccgtggctaccatattttctcgGST-Sts-1-SH3ReverseccgctcgagaccatgaaatatccaggtgctGST-Sts-1-SH3 Open table in a new tab Biochemical Assays—For EGFR degradation assays, HEK293T cells were transfected with EGFR, Cbl, FLAG-Ub, and, where indicated, with Sts-2 and its different mutants, were serum-starved and stimulated with EGF (50 ng/ml) for the indicated times. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-EGFR (RK2) antibodies to monitor receptor levels and anti-ERK2 antibodies to ensure equal loading in each well. To examine ERK activity, total cell lysates were immunoblotted with phosphospecific anti-ERK antibodies. Densitometric analysis of specific protein bands from the immunoblots was performed using the AIDA software, version 3.10.039 (Fujifilm). Likewise, for PDGF receptor degradation assays, HEK293T cells were transfected with PGFR-β, Cbl, FLAG-Ub and, where indicated, with Sts-2, serum-starved, and stimulated with PDGF-BB (50 ng/ml) for 30 min. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-PDGFR, anti-ERK2, or anti-pERK antibodies. For Ub-binding assays, cell lysates were incubated with protein A-agarose (Roche) or Ub-Agarose (Boston Biochem), GST was conjugated to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) or immobilized GST-Ub for 4 h at 4 °C. Bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. Receptor Down-regulation Assays—CHO cells were transfected in 10-cm cell culture dishes with EGFR, Cbl, Sts-1, Sts-2, Sts-2 mutants, or GFP as a control. After 24 h, cells were split into 12-well dishes and analyzed the next day. To measure EGFR molecules remaining at the cellular membrane, transfected CHO cells were washed two times with serum-free internalization medium (F12K medium + 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and either were left unstimulated or were incubated with 50 ng/ml EGF at 37 °C for the indicated times. Cells underwent an acid wash with phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% BSA, pH 3.4, to remove surface EGF, and were incubated for 1 h with 125I-EGF at 4 °C. Surplus 125I-EGF was removed and cells were washed two times with cold internalization medium. Surface-bound 125I-EGF was determined by lysis of cells in 1 m NaOH and analysis in a γ-counter (1470 Wizard; PerkinElmer). Unspecific binding of 125I-EGF was measured by incubation of non-transfected CHO cells with 5 ng/ml 125I-EGF. Average c.p.m. measured from six samples were deducted from the individual c.p.m. of each test sample. Values for EGF-stimulated cells were compared with nonstimulated cells to calculate the percentage of surface remaining receptor. Each time point was measured in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated two times. Thymidine Incorporation—NIH3T3 cells stably expressing Sts-2 and its indicated mutants or GFP as a control were seeded at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/well. After 24 h, a 4-h pulse of [3H]thymidine was added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 1 μCi/ml. Thereafter, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA), rinsed with water, and dehydrated in 70% ethanol. DNA was extracted in 0.1 m NaOH. After addition of scintillation mixture, radioactivity was measured in a β-counter. The data are plotted as average values with standard errors of triplicate repeats for each condition. Immunofluorescence—COS-1 and CHO-EGFR cells seeded on collagen-coated cover slips were transfected with indicated constructs for 24 h and starved for an additional 12 h. Cells were left untreated or were stimulated with rhodamine-labeled EGF (40 ng/ml) for 20 min at 37 °C and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. After permeabilization and blocking, cells were incubated with primary antibodies and then with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (DakoCytomation). The preparations were mounted using Fluoromount G (Immunkemi), and the images were taken with a Zeiss Axioplan 2microscope. Soft Agar Assays—NIH3T3 cells stably expressing FLAG-Sts-2 and its indicated mutants or an empty vector were plated at different concentrations (2.5 × 104, 5 × 104, and 10 × 104 cells per plate) in culture medium containing 0.3% low-melting agarose, in plates coated with medium containing 0.6% low-melting agarose. Dishes were monitored after 2 weeks for colony formation. Colonies were counted by scoring the number of colonies in five randomly chosen view fields using a 40× objective. The data are presented as average number of clones formed with standard errors for each condition. Cbl Couples Sts-1/Sts-2 Adaptor Molecules to the Activated Receptor Complexes—In our searches for cellular effectors of Cbl, we used the yeast two-hybrid system and identified several Cbl-interacting proteins (Clips), namely Clip1/SH3P2 (16Szymkiewicz I. Destaing O. Jurdic P. Dikic I. FEBS Lett. 2004; 565: 33-38Google Scholar), Clip2/CIN85 (5Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Google Scholar), Clip3/ArgBP2 (17Soubeyran P. Barac A. Szymkiewicz I. Dikic I. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 29-34Google Scholar), Clip4/UBASH3A/Sts-1 (18Wattenhofer M. Shibuya K. Kudoh J. Lyle R. Michaud J. Rossier C. Kawasaki K. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Berry A. Bonne-Tamir B. Shimizu N. Antonarakis S.E. Scott H.S. Hum. Genet. 2001; 108: 140-147Google Scholar), and Clip5/Nck (19Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Sameshima J.H. Marcilla A. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17363-17366Google Scholar). All these clones encoded one or more SH3 domains that interacted strongly with the proline-rich sequences of Cbl in yeast cells (data not shown). Cloning of the full-size Clip4 cDNA revealed that it is encoded by the UBASH3A gene (18Wattenhofer M. Shibuya K. Kudoh J. Lyle R. Michaud J. Rossier C. Kawasaki K. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Berry A. Bonne-Tamir B. Shimizu N. Antonarakis S.E. Scott H.S. Hum. Genet. 2001; 108: 140-147Google Scholar) but represents a spliced variant with an internal deletion of 39 amino acid residues between the UBA and SH3 domains (Fig. 1, A and G). Clip4 shares sequence homology with another ubiquitously expressed mammalian protein known as p70 (20Carpino N. Kobayashi R. Zang H. Takahashi Y. Jou S.T. Feng J. Nakajima H. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7491-7500Google Scholar) and has orthologues in Drosophilia melanogaster and Danio rerio, which all together form a novel family of UBA and SH3 domain-containing proteins (Fig. 1, A and G). Those adaptor proteins have recently been designated as the Suppressor of T-cell receptor signaling (Sts) family (21Carpino N. Turner S. Mekala D. Takahashi Y. Zang H. Geiger T.L. Doherty P. Ihle J.N. Immunity. 2004; 20: 37-46Google Scholar); therefore, we will refer to p70 as Sts-1 and Clip4 as Sts-2 hereafter. Sts-1 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas Sts-2 is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells and tissues (20Carpino N. Kobayashi R. Zang H. Takahashi Y. Jou S.T. Feng J. Nakajima H. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7491-7500Google Scholar), although RT-PCR analysis indicates that Sts-2 mRNA is also present at the lower level in placenta (18Wattenhofer M. Shibuya K. Kudoh J. Lyle R. Michaud J. Rossier C. Kawasaki K. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Berry A. Bonne-Tamir B. Shimizu N. Antonarakis S.E. Scott H.S. Hum. Genet. 2001; 108: 140-147Google Scholar) and some epithelial cell lines (data not shown). We initially confirmed that the SH3 domains of Sts-1 and Sts-2 bind to the proline-rich region of Cbl in mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation from lysates of HEK293T cells expressing Cbl and Sts-2 or their respective mutants (Fig. 1, B-D) and by GST pull-down assays with the SH3 domain of Sts-1 (Fig. 1E). Moreover, with the use of antibodies cross-reacting with Sts-1 and Sts-2, we demonstrated that Cbl readily associates with endogenous Sts-1/Sts-2 in HeLa cells, whereas specific anti-Sts-1 antibodies enabled Cbl/Sts-1 complex detection in CHO-EGFR cells (Fig. 1F). Interactions between Cbl and Sts-1 or Sts-2 were independent of EGF stimulation or EGFR-induced phosphorylation of Cbl (Fig. 1, C and F), whereas the association of Cbl with tyrosine phosphorylated EGFRs was increased upon ligand stimulation (Fig. 1F). Therefore, Sts-1 and Sts-2 were recruited to complexes with activated EGFRs after EGF stimulation (Fig. 1, C and F). In contrast, a mutant form of Sts-2 that contains a non-functional SH3 domain (Sts-2-SH3*, with mutation of tryptophan 279 to alanine) was unable to bind to Cbl and to associate with EGFRs (Fig. 1C), further confirming that Sts-2-Cbl interactions are critical for binding of Sts-2 to activated EGFRs.Fig. 1Sts-1/Sts-2 are recruited to activated EGF receptors via SH3 domain-mediated binding to Cbl.A, schematic representation of Sts family members indicating defined domains: UBA domain, SH3 domain, PGM domain. B, FLAG-tagged Sts-2 constructs were co-expressed with HA-tagged Cbl in HEK293T cells and lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with either anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibodies and immunoblotted (WB) with anti-Cbl or anti-Sts-2 (α-992) antibodies. The numbers indicate the approximate molecular mass in kilodaltons. Mr, relative molecular mass. C, COS-1 cells transfected with indicated Sts-2 constructs were left unstimulated (-) or stimulated with EGF, then immunoprecipitated with anti-Sts-2 (α-PGM) antibodies and blotted with indicated antibodies. D, FLAG-tagged Sts-2 was co-expressed with HA-tagged Cbl-655 or Cbl-480 in HEK293T cells, and lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Sts-2 antibodies and immunoblotted with a mixture of anti-HA/FLAG antibodies. TCL, total cell lysate. E, HA-tagged Cbl, Cbl-655, and Cbl-480 were expressed in HEK293T cells and incubated with GST-fusion proteins containing the SH3 domain of Sts-1. Detection was performed by blotting with anti-HA antibody. F, left, HeLa cells were starved (-) or stimulated with EGF for 10 min, and lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against Sts-1/Sts-2 (α-PGM), antibodies against EGFR (108), or pre-immune serum, followed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Right, CHO cells stably expressing EGF receptors were left unstimulated (-) or stimulated with EGF for 10 min. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-EGFR (108) or anti-Cbl antibodies and blotted with indicated antibodies. G, multiple sequence alignment of Clip4/Sts-2/UBASH3A and p70/Sts-1 family members was performed with the use of ClustalW program (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/). The conserved structural domains are highlighted. The GenBank accession numbers of the family members are as follows: Clip4/Sts-2, identical to AAP80738; UBASH3A human, AAP80738; UBASH3A mouse, mCP91636 (Celera); UBASH3A rat, Ensembl prediction ENSRNOG00000008187; p70/Sts-1 human, NM_032873; Sts-1 mouse, NP_116262; Sts-1 rat, Ensembl prediction ENSRNOG00000008187; D. rerio, Ensembl prediction ENSDARG00000006256; D. melanogaster, CG13604 (flybase symbol); C. elegans, T07F12.1 (wormbase transcript).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In their C-terminal parts, Sts-1 and Sts-2 also contain an evolutionary conserved domain present in their orthologues in Caenorhabditis elegans and D. melanogaster, thus being named HCD (Human, C. elegans, D. melanogaster) domain (18Wattenhofer M. Shibuya K. Kudoh J. Lyle R. Michaud J. Rossier C. Kawasaki K. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Berry A. Bonne-Tamir B. Shimizu N. Antonarakis S.E. Scott H.S. Hum. Genet. 2001; 108: 140-147Google Scholar). This domain is highly homologous to PGM proteins, which are involved in transfer of phosphate groups between the carbon atoms in glycerates (22Jedrzejas M.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2000; 73: 263-287Google Scholar). However, even though the PGM domains of Sts-1 and Sts-2 share conserved residues with other PGM domains, others and we have not been able to confirm their ability to isomerize phosphoglycerate substrates (Ref. 20Carpino N. Kobayashi R. Zang H. Takahashi Y. Jou S.T. Feng J. Nakajima H. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7491-7500Google Scholar and data not shown). On the other hand, it has been reported previously that phosphoglycerate mutases form dimers or tetramers in mammalian cells (22Jedrzejas M.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2000; 73: 263-287Google Scholar). Along the lines of these studies, we have observed that Sts-2 or its isolated PGM domain run as doublets in SDS-PAGE when immunoprecipitated from HEK293T cells overexpressing high amounts of proteins (Fig. 2). Therefore, chemical cross-linking performed on the lysates of transfected COS-1 cells revealed that wild type Sts-2 is exclusively present as a dimeric or oligomeric protein (Fig. 2). It is noteworthy that deletion of the PGM domain resulted in a monomeric protein of the molecular mass around 30 kDa, whereas the construct encoding only the isolated PGM domain was efficiently dimerized (Fig. 2), further indicating that the PGM domain is essential for oligomerization of Sts-2 in cells. Altogether, these results support the notion that Sts-1 and Sts-2 are two structurally related proteins (Fig. 1, A and G) that bind to and regulate Cbl functions in mammalian cells. UBA Domains of Sts-1/Sts-2 Bind to Mono-Ub Attached to the EGFR—To further elucidate the role of Sts-1/Sts-2, we analyzed the functional significance of their UBA domains. UBA domains have been demonstrated to mediate Ub binding of several proteins (23Bertolaet B.L. Clarke D.J. Wolff M. Watson M.H. Henze M. Divita G. Reed S.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 417-422Google Scholar, 24Wilkinson C.R. Seeger M. Hartmann-Petersen R. Stone M. Wallace M. Semple C. Gordon C. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 939-943Google Scholar). To test whether Sts-1 and Sts-2 are bona fide Ub-receptors, lysates of cells expressing Sts-1 or Sts-2 were incubated with mono-Ub-coupled affinity matrices. Sts-1 and Sts-2 readily bound to mono-Ub linked to agarose (Ubagarose) and to GST-Ub, but not to control beads (Fig. 3A). Because Cbl also possesses an UBA domain in its C-terminal part, we tested its ubiquitin binding capacity as well. However, no binding of Cbl to GST-Ub was detected (Fig. 3A, right), implying that not all UBA domains can act as Ub-receptors. It is noteworthy that deletion of the UBA domain of Sts-2 (Sts-2-ΔUBA) completely blocked its binding to either GST-Ub or Ub-agarose (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, under identical experimental conditions and using all proteins tagged with the same FLAG epitope, we noted that full-size Sts-2 seems to bind to mono-Ub-coupled matrices more potently than Eps15, epsin, or Hrs (Fig. 3C). These proteins contain UIMs, involved in binding and endocytic sorting of ubiquitinated EGF receptors (9Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Hofmann K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 491-497Google Scholar, 25Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Google Scholar). We have also observed that Sts-2 is found in complexes with ubiquitinated EGFRs upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 3D), suggesting that the UBA domain of Sts-2 might contribute to recruitment of Sts-1/2 in complexes with activated EGFRs. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the association of Sts-2 and Eps15 with an EGFRΔ-Ub chimera, consisting of a single Ub fused to the extracellular and transmembrane domain of the EGFR (6Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Google Scholar). Sts-2 and to a lesser extent Eps15 were found in complexes with the EGFRΔ-Ub chimera but not with the control EGFRΔ-FLAG protein (Fig. 3E, left). On the other hand, the isolated UBA domain itself did not bind to the EGFR-ΔUb chimera under identical experimental conditions (data not shown), suggesting that the isolated UBA domain is not sufficient to mediate binding to Ub attached to the EGFR in cells. It is thus possible that dimerization of Sts-2 via its PGM domain (Fig. 2) and recruitment of Sts-2 to Cbl/EGFR complexes (Fig. 1), can increase the avidity of the Sts-2 UBA domain binding to mono-Ub and thus promote interactions between Sts-2 and ubiquitinated receptors in cells. To further test this possibility, we analyzed the ability of Sts-2 or its mutants to interfere with binding of the endocytic sorting protein epsin with ubiquitinated EGFR complexes in vivo. Expression of Sts-2, but not of the Sts-2 UBA domain, significantly reduced the ligand-dependent association of epsin with ubiquitinated EGFRs (Fig. 3E, middle). In addition, Sts-2-ΔUBA or Sts-2-SH3*, unable to bind to Ub or Cbl, respectively (Figs. 3B and 1C), were also impaired in their ability to block binding of epsin to activated EGFR complexes (Fig. 3E, right). Even though we cannot provide a final proof that the Sts-2 UBA domain indeed associates with ubiquitinated receptors in cells, it is reasonable to assume that Sts-2, once recruited to EGFR complexes via its SH3 domain (Fig. 1), requires the UBA domain to compete against interactions between the endocytic sorting machinery and ubiquitinated EGFR complexes. Sts-1 and Sts-2 Inhibit Receptor Endocytosis and Degradation—Ubiquitination of RTKs has been recognized as an important signal for receptor down-regulation and degradation (26Dikic I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1178-1181Google Scholar, 27Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Druker B. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7927-7932Google Scholar, 2Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Google Scholar). To reveal whether Sts-2 binding to EGFRs or other ubiquitinated components of endocytic machinery affects receptor trafficking, we measured the rate of receptor internalization and endocytosis in the presence of Sts-1, Sts-2, or its mutants. Expression of Sts-2 or Sts-1 potently blocked EGFR removal from the cell surface (Fig. 4A), whereas expression of Sts-2-ΔUBA, and to a lesser extent Sts-2-SH3*, had no such inhibitory effect and even slightly accelerated the rate of receptor internalization (Fig. 4A). Consistent with the previous results, Sts-2 efficiently blocked formation of EGFR-containing vesicles in COS-1 cells (Fig. 4B), whereas EGFR endocytosis was unaffected in cells transfected with Sts-2-ΔUBA or Sts-2-SH3* (Fig."
https://openalex.org/W1996293435,"Mangiferin, a natural polyphenol is known to exhibit anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiviral effects. However the molecular mechanism underlying these effects has not been well characterized. Because NF-κB plays an important role in these processes, it is possible that mangiferin modulates NF-κB activation. Our results show that mangiferin blocks tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced NF-κB activation and NF-κB-dependent genes like ICAM1 and COX2. The effect was mediated through inhibition of IKK activation and subsequent blocking of phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα.In addition, mangiferin inhibits TNF-induced p65 phosphorylation as well as translocation to the nucleus and also inhibits NF-κB activation induced by other inflammatory agents like PMA, ceramide, and SA-LPS. Mangiferin, similar to the other known antioxidants, NAC and PDTC, inhibits TNF-induced reactive oxygen intermediate (ROI) generation. Since intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels are known to modulate NF-κB levels, we measured the levels of GSH. Mangiferin enhances glutathione level by almost 2-fold more than other anti-oxidants, and at the same time it decreases the levels of GSSG and increases the activity of catalase. Depletion of GSH by buthionine sulfoximine led to a significant reversal of mangiferin effect. Hence mangiferin with its ability to inhibit NF-κB and increase the intracellular GSH levels may prove to be a potent drug for anti-inflammatory and antioxidant therapy. Mangiferin-mediated down-regulation of NF-κB also potentiates chemotherapeutic agent-mediated cell death, suggesting a role in combination therapy for cancer. Mangiferin, a natural polyphenol is known to exhibit anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiviral effects. However the molecular mechanism underlying these effects has not been well characterized.

Immunology. 1995; 84: 543-548PubMed Google Scholar). Some reports suggest that TNF produces reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI), which in turn oxidizes intracellular glutathione, a critical change for TNF-induced apoptosis and nuclear transcription factor κB (NF-κB) activation (8Roederer M.

Bernasconi S. Ghezzi P. Mantovani A. Sicca A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2761-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Imbalance between production and elimination of ROI develops during inflammation, ischemia/reperfusion, altered metabolism, action of drugs, pollutants, etc. Such disbalance causes pathology of brain, heart, airways, parenchymatous organs (liver, kidney, and pancreas), eyes, skin, joints, etc. Exposure of the tissues to reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a variety of biological systems has documented their ability to damage lipids, proteins, and DNA. The effects of ROS could be prevented or stopped by eliminating and/or substituting antioxidant enzymes or administering non-enzyme antioxidants and scavengers. The transcription factors thought to be involved in inflammation and allergic disorders are NF-κB, AP-1, CREB, STAT, and GATA-3. Most of the inflammatory genes overexpressed in inflammation such as those encoding proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and inflammatory enzymes contain κB sites for NF-κB within their promoter suggesting that these genes are controlled predominantly by NF-κB (13Christmas J.W. Sadikot R.T. Blackwell T.S. Chest. 2000; 117: 1482-1487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a heterodimer of two subunits p50 (NF-κB1) and p65 (Rel A), which is normally present in the cytoplasm in an inactive state, complexed with its inhibitory subunit, IκBα. Upon phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα, the nuclear localization signal on the p50-p65 heterodimer is exposed, leading to nuclear translocation and transcription of dependent genes (14Sun N.J. Woo S.H. Cassady J.M. Snapka R.M. J. Natl. Prod. 1998; 61: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The activation of NF-κB and its associated kinases like IκBα kinase (IKK) is in most cases dependent on the production of reactive oxygen species (15Manna S.K. Zhang H.J. Yan T. Oberley L.W.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). GSH is important for many cellular and biochemical functions including the regulation of gene transcription, as well as the modulation of apoptosis (19Coffey R.N. Watson R.W. Hegarty N.J. O'Neill A. Gibbons N. Brady H.R. Fitzpatrick J.M. Cancer. 2000; 88: 2092-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20Arrigo A.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 936-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The binding of many transcription factors to their cognate DNA sequences is sensitive to the redox environment. One such redox sensitive transcription factor is NF-κB (20Arrigo A.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 936-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 21Sen C.K. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 2000; 36: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 22Hutter D. Greene J.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Several reports suggested that NF-κB activation is critical for the regulation of genes that are mediating cell survival and may have an anti-apoptotic role; hence, the inhibition of NF-κB sensitizes the cells to various apoptosis inducing agents, which include TNF and chemotherapeutic drugs (23Sreenivasan Y. Sarkar A. Manna S.K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4356-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence demonstrates that ROS, for example, superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, promote cell proliferation, and the antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase and catalase scavenge these ROS (24Shi M. Yang H. Motley E.D. Guo Z. Am. J. Hypertens. 2004; 17: 450-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Phenolic antioxidants exhibit anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, and antidiabetic activities in animals (25Futakuchi M. Hirose M. Miki T. Tanaka H. Ozaki M. Shirai T. Eur. J. Cancer Prev. 1998; 7: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Talalay P. De Long M.G. Prochaska H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Human beings consume antioxidants from dietary sources, either as natural components or as synthetic food additives (28Nunn C.J. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1991; 29: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 29Yang C.S. Lnadau J.M. Huang M.T. Newmark H.L. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 381-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). The broad spectrum of the function of phenolic antioxidants suggests there are multiple targets through which they interfere with various cellular functions and protect against pathological lesions such as cancer and inflammatory diseases. Currently there is an increasing interest in therapeutic use of antioxidants to prevent tissue damage induced by overproduction of ROI, by reducing free radical formation or by scavenging or promoting the breakdown of these species (30Young I.S. Woodside J.V. J. Clin. Pathol. 2001; 54: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar, 31Coliins A.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 32Cuzzocrea S. Riley O.P. Caputi A.P. Salvemini D. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 135-159PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments in different in vitro and in vivo systems have demonstrated the potent antioxidant action of plant polyphenols (33Damianaki A. Bakogeorgou E. Kampa M. Notas G. Hatzoglou A. Panagiotou S. Gemetzi C. Kouroumalis E. Martin P.M. Castanas E. J. Cell.

Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 4381-4385PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the polyphenol mangiferin, a C-glucosylxanthone, specifically 1,3,6,7-hydroxyxanthone-C2-β-d-glucoside, has attracted considerable interest in view of its numerous pharmacological activities, including antitumor, antiviral (35Guha S.

Bull. 2001; 24: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As carcinogenic, inflammatory, and growth modulatory effects of many chemicals are mediated by NF-κB, we hypothesized that the suppression of the NF-κB activation pathway accounts for mangiferin activity. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the anti-inflammatory effects of mangiferin is mediated through modulation of NF-κB and glutathione levels. We have shown that mangiferin inhibits NF-κB by preventing the activation of IKK followed by phosphorylation and degradation of its inhibitory subunit IκBα. Also for the first time, we have demonstrated that mangiferin increases glutathione level and inhibits TNF-activated ROI. In this report, we also prove the hypothesis that down-regulation of NF-κB by mangiferin leads to potentiation of chemotherapeutic agent-mediated apoptosis. Mangiferin, glycine, pyrollidone dithiocarbamate (PDTC), 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (ATZ), l-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), tocopherol, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), 4-methyl umbelliferyl phosphate, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), bovine serum albumin, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), ceramide, Texas Red, sulfosalisilic acid, NADPH, DTNB [5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid], glutathione reductase, 2-vinylpiridine, triethanolamine, catalase, and anticatalase antibody were obtained from Sigma Aldrich Chemicals. Penicillin, streptomycin, neomycin, RPMI 1640 medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, and custom synthesized NF-κB oligonucleotides (both 5′-3′ and 3′-5′) were obtained from Invitrogen Life Technologies and TNF from Peprotech. Antibodies against p50, p65, IκBα, IKKα, IKKβ, cyclin D1, c-Rel, ICAM1, COX2, and tubulin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody against phospho-IκBα was obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate, and Live/Dead cell assay kit were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The GST-IκBα construct was cloned, and purified protein was used as a substrate for IKK. The plasmid constructs for NF-κB-SEAP, Cox-2-Luciferase, TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2, NIK, IKK, p65, and dominant negative IκBα were kindly supplied by Prof. B. B. Aggarwal of the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX). The cell lines used in this study were as follows: U-937 (human histiocytic lymphoma), HeLa (human epithelial cells), MCF-7 (human breast cancer cell line), IRB3 AN27 (murine mesencephalic cells), and Jurkat (T cells) obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). U-937 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium while others in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). All cells were free from mycoplasma, as detected by Gen-Probe mycoplasma rapid detection kit (Fisher Scientific). To determine NF-κB activation, EMSA was conducted essentially as described (41Chaturvedi M. Kumar A. Darnay B.G. Chainy G.B.N. Aggarwal S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30129-30134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8 μg of nuclear extract proteins were incubated with 32P-end-labeled 45-mer double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide of HIV-LTR, 5′-TTG TTA CAA GGG ACT TTC CGC TGG GGA CTT TCC AGG GAG GCG TGG-3′ (bold indicates the NF-κB binding site) for 30 min at 37 °C, and the DNA-protein complex formed was separated from free oligonucleotide on 6.6% native polyacrylamide gels. The specificity of binding was examined by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotide. Visualization and quantitation of radioactive bands were done as indicated above. The effect of mangiferin on TNF-, TNFR1-, TRAF-2-, TRADD-, NIK-, IKK-, and p65 (transactivation subunit of NF-κB)-induced NF-κB-dependent reporter gene transcription was measured as previously described (42Darnay B. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7724-7731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Briefly, U-937 cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 1 ml of medium containing plasmid DNAs for TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2, NIK, IKK, or p65 (1 μg each) along with 0.5 μg of NF-κB promoter DNA linked to the heat-stable secretory alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) gene. The total amount of DNA was maintained at 3 μg by the addition of the control plasmid pCMVFLAG1 DNA. After 12 h, cells were treated with 10 μg/ml mangiferin for 3 h and then stimulated with TNF for another 12 h. Cell culture-conditioned medium was harvested, and analyzed for alkaline phosphatase activity essentially as per the Clontech protocol (Palo Alto, CA). In brief, 25 μl of medium was mixed with 30 μlof5× buffer (0.5 m Tris, pH 9 and 0.5% bovine serum albumin) in a total volume of 100 μl in a 96-well plate and incubated at 65 °C for 30 min. The plate was chilled on ice for 2 min. Then 50 μl of 1 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The activity of SEAP was assayed on a 96-well fluorescent plate reader (Fluoroscan II, Lab Systems, Needham Heights, MA) with excitation set at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm. The average number (±S.D.) of relative fluorescent light units for each transfection was then determined and reported as fold activation with respect to control vector-transfected cells. This reporter system was specific, because TNF-induced NF-κB SEAP activity was inhibited by overexpression of IκBα mutants lacking either Ser32 or Ser36 (42Darnay B. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7724-7731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). For transfection control, cells were co-transfected with β-galactosidase and the activity was assayed from each transfection. To determine the levels of IκBα and phospho IκBα, cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from cells and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (15Manna S.K. Zhang H.J. Yan T. Oberley L.W. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13245-13254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). To determine the levels of NF-κB, p65, and its active form phospho-p65, nuclear extracts were prepared from TNF-treated cells and were resolved in 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. A Western blot was done using anti-IκBα, -phospho-IκBα, -p65, or -phospho-p65 and detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The effect of mangiferin on the nuclear translocation of p65 was examined by the immunocytochemical method as described (43Vinitsky A. Michaud C. Powers J.C. Orlowski M. Biochem. 1992; 31: 9421-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, treated cells were plated on a poly-l-lysine-coated glass slide air-dried, fixed with 3% formaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% of Triton X-100. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, slides were blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-human p65 antibody at 1:100 dilutions. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the slides were washed, incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-FITC (Molecular Probes) at 1:100 dilutions for 1 h, washed with PBS, and stained for cytosol with Texas Red for 10 min. Stained slides were mounted with mounting medium with DAPI (to counterstain the nucleus) purchased from Molecular Probes and analyzed under a fluorescence microscope. The IKK assay was performed by a method described previously (44DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature (Lond.). 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). Briefly, the IKK complex from whole cell extract (300 μg) was precipitated with anti-IKKα and -IKKβ antibodies (1 μg each), followed by treatment with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Pierce). After a 2-h incubation, the beads were washed with lysis buffer and then assayed in kinase assay mixture containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm unlabeled ATP, and 2 μg of substrate GST-IκBα (amino acids 1–54). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by boiling with SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min. Finally, the protein was resolved on 9% SDS-PAGE, the gel was dried, and the radioactive bands were visualized by PhosphorImager. To determine the total amounts of IKKα in each sample, 50 μg of the whole cell protein was resolved on 9% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and then blotted with anti-IKKα antibody. U-937 cells (3 × 106/ml) were treated with 5 mm NAC and different concentrations of mangiferin. The cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 1% Triton X-100. GSH and GSSG were measured by enzymatic recycling assay described by Anderson (45Anderson M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar). After 50 μl of 10% sulfosalisilic acid was added to each 100-μl aliquot of cell lysate, the samples were centrifuged (10,000 × g) for 5 min at 4 °C to precipitate the protein. To assay total glutathione, a 50-μl aliquot of supernatant was added to a mixture of 0.7 ml of 0.3 mm NADPH, 100 μl of 6 mm DTNB, and 175 μlofH2O. After adding 10 μl of 50 units/ml glutathione reductase, the rate of change in optical density at 405 nm was assessed. To assay GSSG, the GSH present in the sample was derivatized by adding 2 μl of 2-vinylpiridine and 6 μl of triethanolamine to a 100-μl aliquot of supernatant. After 60 min of incubation at 25 °C, GSSG was measured in the same manner as GSH. Cellular catalase values were determined using the method described in Beers and Sizer (46Beers Jr., R.F. Sizer I.W. J. Bio. Chem. 1952; 195: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Nelson D.P. Keisow L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Briefly, U-937 cells were treated with 10 μg/ml of mangiferin and 5 mm of NAC for 6 h. Cells were pelleted, washed with PBS, lysed in 100 μl of 1% Triton X-100, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. H2O2 was used as the substrate of catalase. Catalase was assayed by the disappearance of peroxide, which was detected spectrophotometrically at 240 nm. The incubation mixture contained 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 2 mm H2O2 and sample (enzyme source). The decrease in absorbance was recorded at 240 nm for 2 min. MTT Assay—The cytotoxicity was assayed by the MTT dye uptake (18Kumar A. Aggarwal B.B. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, U-937 cells (104 cells/well of 96-well plate) were incubated with test sample in a final volume of 0.1 ml for 72 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, 25 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each well. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, 0.1 ml of the extraction buffer (20% SDS, 50% dimethylformamide) was added. After an overnight incubation at 37 °C, the absorbance was read at 570 nm using a 96-well multiscanner autoreader (Bio-Rad), with the extraction buffer as a blank. Live/Dead Assay—The cytotoxic effects were also determined by the Live/Dead assay (48Levesque A. Paquet A. Page M. Cytometry. 1995; 20: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Molecular Probes). Briefly, after different treatment 1 × 105 cells were stained with Live/Dead reagent (5 μm ethidium homodimer, 5 μm calcein-AM) and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Labophot-2, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). We examined the effect of mangiferin on TNF-induced signal transduction. The chemical structure of mangiferin is shown in Fig. 1. Because U-937 cells express both types of TNF receptor, and as TNF-induced responses in this cell type are well characterized in our laboratory, these cells were used for our studies. Mangiferin was dissolved in Me2SO (10 mg/ml) and further dilution was made in complete medium. At the concentration of mangiferin and duration of exposure employed in these studies, there was no effect on cell viability as detected by the trypan blue dye exclusion method (98.52 ± 2.48, 96.62 ± 4.82, and 96.24 ± 3.76 percentage of cell viability was observed at 2, 5, and 10 μg/ml mangiferin, respectively, for 3 h of incubation). Inhibition of TNF-induced NF-κB Activation by Mangiferin—U-937 cells were pretreated for 3 h with different concentrations (0–10 μg/ml) of mangiferin and then stimulated with and without 0.1 nm TNF for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared and assayed for NF-κB by EMSA. As shown in Fig. 2A, TNF induced 7-fold activation of NF-κB and mangiferin inhibited TNF-induced activation of NF-κB in a dose-dependent manner; with a complete inhibition from 10 μg/ml. Mangiferin by itself did not activate NF-κB. However, it was unable to protect the activation of NF-κB when given as post-treatment after TNF (Fig. 2C). We also examined the effect of mangiferin on the kinetics of TNF-induced NF-κB activation. Both untreated and mangiferin-pretreated cells were incubated with TNF (0.1 nm) for different times and then assayed for NF-κB. In untreated cells, TNF activated NF-κB from 0 to 6.5-fold in a time-dependent manner with almost maximum activation at 15 min (Fig. 2D). In mangiferin-pretreated cells, activation of NF-κB was inhibited at all time points of TNF stimulation. Activated NF-κB Inhibited by Mangiferin Consists of p50 and p65 Subunits—Various combinations of Rel/NF-κB proteins can constitute an active NF-κB heterodimer that binds to specific sequences in DNA. To show that the retarded band visualized by EMSA in TNF-treated cells was indeed NF-κB, we incubated the nuclear extracts from TNF-activated cells with antibody to either p50 (NF-κBI) or p65 (Rel A) subunits and then performed EMSA. Antibodies to either subunit of NF-κB shifted the band to a higher molecular size (Fig. 2B), thus suggesting that the TNF-activated complex consisted of p50 and p65 subunits. Neither preimmune serum nor irrelevant antibodies such as anti-c-Rel or anti-cyclin D1 had any effect on the mobility of NF-κB. Excess cold NF-κB (100-fold) almost completely eliminated the band, indicating the specificity of NF-κB. Mangiferin Represses TNF-induced NF-κB-dependent Reporter Gene Expression—Although we have shown by EMSA that mangiferin blocks the NF-κB activation, DNA binding alone does not always correlate with NF-κB-dependent gene transcription, suggesting the role of additional regulatory mechanisms (49Nasuhara Y. Adcock I.M. Catley M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19965-19972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of mangiferin on TNF-induced NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression, we transiently co-transfected U-937 cells with the NF-κB SEAP reporter construct and β-galactosidase then treated with mangiferin (10 μg/ml) for 3 h. Cells were then stimulated with different concentrations of TNF for 12 h. An almost 6-fold increase in SEAP activity over the vector control was noted upon stimulation with TNF (Fig. 2E). TNF-induced SEAP activity was almost completely abolished when the cells were pretreated with mangiferin. These results demonstrate that mangiferin also represses NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression induced by TNF. The β-galactosidase activity from cell extracts showed almost similar reduction of absorbance (as per Promega protocol) at 420 nm (data not shown) suggesting the transfection control for each treatment. Mangiferin Inhibits TNF-induced ICAM1 and COX2 Expression and COX2-dependent Reporter Gene Expression—As mangiferin inhibited TNF-induced different biological responses, we examined the expression of NF-κB regulated genes, adhesion molecule ICAM1 and COX2. U-937 cells were treated with different concentrations of mangiferin for 3 h and then stimulated with 0.1 nm TNF for 12 h. We analyzed ICAM1 and COX2 in the cell extract proteins by Western blot. TNF induced ICAM1 (Fig. 3A) and COX2 (Fig. 3B) expression were decreased with increased concentrations of mangiferin treatment. Mangiferin alone did not s"

We analyzed the time course of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) at glutamatergic neuromuscular junctions of Drosophila and found that the decay phase of EPSCs was protracted to a variable extent. The protraction was more pronounced in evoked and spontaneous quantal EPSCs than in action potential-evoked multiquantal EPSCs; reduced in quantal EPSCs from endophilin null mutants, which maintain release via kiss-and-run; and dependent on synaptotagmin isoform, calcium, and protein phosphorylation. Our data indicate that glutamate is released from individual synaptic vesicles for milliseconds through a fusion pore. Quantal glutamate discharge time course depends on presynaptic calcium inflow and the molecular composition of the release machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2070483391,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type proteins are essential for bile formation in vertebrate liver. BSEP, MDR1, MDR2, and MRP2 ABC transporters are targeted to the apical (canalicular) membrane of hepatocytes where they execute ATP-dependent transport of bile acids, drugs, amphipathic cations, phospholipids, and conjugated organic anions, respectively. Changes in activity and abundance of transporters in the canalicular membrane regulate bile flow; however, little is known regarding cellular proteins that bind ABC transporters and regulate their trafficking. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified HAX-1 as a binding partner for BSEP, MDR1, and MDR2. The interactions were validated biochemically by glutathione S-transferase pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. BSEP and HAX-1 were over-represented in rat liver subcellular fractions enriched for canalicular membrane vesicles, microsomes, and clathrin-coated vesicles. HAX-1 was bound to BSEP, MDR1, and MDR2 in canalicular membrane vesicles and co-localized with BSEP and MDR1 in the apical membrane of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. RNA interference of HAX-1 increased BSEP levels in the apical membrane of MDCK cells by 71%. Pulse-chase studies indicated that HAX-1 depletion did not affect BSEP translation, post-translational modification, delivery to the plasma membrane, or half-life. HAX-1 depletion resulted in an increased peak of metabolically labeled apical membrane BSEP at 4 h and enhanced retention at 6 and 9 h. HAX-1 also interacts with cortactin. Expression of dominant negative cortactin increased steady state levels of BSEP 2-fold in the apical membrane of MDCK cells, as did expression of dominant negative EPS15.

The ABC transporters MDR1 (ABCB1), MDR2 (ABCB4) (MDR3 in humans), and BSEP/SPGP (ABCB11) (bile salt export protein, also called sister of P-glycoprotein), which are closely related in structure and sequence, mediate ATP-dependent transport of biliary constituents. BSEP transports conjugated bile acids (1Gerloff T. Stieger B. Hagenbuch B. Madon J. Landmann L. Roth J. Hofmann A.F. Meier P.J. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Google Scholar). MRP2 (ABCC3), which has a different structure and belongs to a different ABC transporter subfamily, mediates secretion of organic anions (6Paulusma C.C.

Mutations that impair MDR3 exit from the endoplasmic reticulum are associated with cholestasis of pregnancy (10Dixon P.H. Weerasekera N. Linton K.J. Donaldson O. Chambers J. Egginton E. Weaver J.

Genet. 2000; 9: 1209-1217Google Scholar); mutations in BSEP that impair expression of the mutant proteins in the apical membrane of MDCK cells are linked to progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type II (11Wang L. Soroka C.J. Boyer J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 965-972Google Scholar); and deletion of two amino acids in MRP2 of a Dubin-Johnson patient resulted in intracellular retention and accelerated degradation of MRP2 (12Keitel V. Kartenbeck J. Nies A.T. Spring H. Brom M. Keppler D. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 1317-1328Google Scholar). Thus, elucidating pathways that govern trafficking of ABC transporters to and from the canalicular membrane can provide critical insight into mechanisms underlying normal biliary secretion and cholestasis (bile secretory failure).Targeting and trafficking of integral membrane proteins depend on sequence motifs in the proteins, interactions with signaling and trafficking networks, and polypeptides that bind the membrane proteins. Few proteins have been identified that associate with ABC transporters and participate in their mobilization and targeting. Interactions with PDZ domain proteins NHERF/EBP50 and E3Karp (13Short D.B.

MRP2 retention in the apical membrane requires interaction with radixin (16Kikuchi S. Hata M. Fukumoto K. Yamane Y. Matsui T. Tamura A. Yonemura S. Yamagishi H. Keppler D. Tsukita S. Nat.

MDR1, MDR2, and BSEP do not contain obvious PDZ-interacting motifs, and apical expression of MDR proteins is not affected in the liver of radixin knockout mice (16Kikuchi S. Hata M. Fukumoto K.

Thus, trafficking of MDR transporters is controlled by a different subset of proteins. By using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified HAX-1 as a binding partner for MDR1, MDR2, and BSEP. HAX-1 is a 34-kDa polypeptide that interacts with a heterogeneous group of proteins that include cortactin (19Gallagher A.R. Cedzich A. Gretz N. Somlo S. Witzgall R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We present evidence indicating that HAX-1 associates with BSEP, MDR1, and MDR2 in the canalicular membrane of rat hepatocytes and that HAX-1 and cortactin regulate BSEP abundance in the apical membrane of MDCK cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Antibodies—The Cytotrap yeast two-hybrid system and vectors were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and pEGFP-N1 and pEYFP-N2 vectors were from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA).

LVT90-Tu41 anti-BSEP IgG was prepared as described (25Kipp H. Arias I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15917-15925Google Scholar). Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin and streptavidin-agarose beads were purchased from Pierce. All other reagents were from Sigma.Anti-rat HAX-1 (rHAX-1) Tu91 antibodies were raised in rabbits against a full-length rHAX-1 peptide fused to a six-histidine carboxyl-terminal tag. Tu91 stained human and rat HAX-1 as 34- and 35-kDa bands, respectively, in extracts derived from transfected HEK293 cells expressing rHAX-1 (see Fig. 4A). Staining was abolished by Tu91 pre-incubation with purified 6H-rHAX-1 protein. Immunofluorescent staining revealed that Tu41 and anti-HAX-1 monoclonal antibodies co-localized in HEK293 cells expressing rat HAX-1.Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—A PCR DNA fragment coding for amino acids 620-698 of rat MDR2 was cloned into the pSOS vector (Stratagene) to generate bait plasmid pSL49. Other pSOS bait plasmids prepared in a similar manner are described below. A liver cDNA library was generated in the pMyr vector from rat liver poly(A)+ RNA using the Superscript system (Invitrogen). Library plasmid DNA was co-transformed into temperature-sensitive cdc25h yeast with pSOS bait plasmids. Yeasts grown for 24-48 h at 25 °C were replica-plated on galactose plates and incubated at the nonpermissive temperature of 37 °C for 3-5 days. Individual colonies that grew at 37 °C were picked and expanded in liquid media at 25 °C. Washed cells were spotted on galactose or glucose solid media and incubated at 37 °C.Plasmid Constructs—The plasmids used in these studies are listed in Table I. Yeast two-hybrid bait plasmids in the pSOS vector (Stratagene) and GST protein expression plasmids in pGEX5-3x vector (Amersham Biosciences) were constructed by ligation with PCR fragments that encode the designated BSEP, MDR2, or MDR1a regions.

Cleared 13,000 × g supernatants were incubated for 2-3 h with 10 μg of GST protein bound to GSH-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed four times with PBS-Triton, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS loading buffer for immunoblot analyses.Culture, Transfection, and Immunofluorescence Microscopy of Mammalian Cells—MDCK II cells (gift of Dr. Enrique Rodriguez-Boulan) were grown in transwells (Corning Glass) and transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Transwells were washed with PBS and fixed for 10 min in ice-cold methanol. Transwell filters were blocked for 1 h in 3% bovine serum albumin and 3% normal donkey serum in Dulbecco's PBS and then incubated for 1-2 h with anti-HAX-1 antibody diluted 1/25 in IF buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in Dulbecco's PBS). Membranes were washed 10 times in PBS, blocked for 30 min with IF buffer, and incubated with Texas Red-labeled donkey anti-mouse antibody for 45 min. Filters were washed 10 times with PBS and mounted on glass slides. BSEP-EYFP, MDR1-EGFP, and Texas Red-stained HAX-1 were visualized using a Leica TRS2 laser confocal microscope.Preparation of Membrane Fractions, Immunoblot Analysis, and Immunoprecipitation—Subcellular fractions were prepared from rat liver as indicated. Enrichment of marker proteins was determined by immunoblot analyses, except for lysosomes and mitochondria, which were measured by biochemical enzyme assays. Briefly, rat livers were perfused with SH buffer (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml benzamidine, 0.1 μl/ml aprotinin) and homogenized in 50 ml of ice-cold SH buffer, and 2000 × g supernatants and pellets were obtained by centrifugation. Canalicular membrane vesicles (CMV) were prepared from the 2000 × g pellet as described (29Inoue M. Kinne R. Tran T. Biempica L. Arias I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5183-5188Google Scholar). Immunoblot analyses indicated CMV were enriched 40-50-fold in MDR1 and MDR2 (C219 antibody), BSEP (LVT90), and cCAM105 (Ab669). The 2000 × g supernatant was used to prepare sinusoidal membrane vesicles (30Inoue M. Kinne R. Tran T. Arias I.M.

A small amount of BSEP was also present but was less than 10% that obtained in equivalent immunoprecipitations with LVT90 (our observations and see Ref. 25Kipp H. Arias I.M. J. Biol.

MDCK cells grown in 12-mm transwell inserts (polyester 0.4-μm pore) were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000, and media were changed every 1-2 days. 2-3 days after confluency, transwells were washed once with ice-cold DMEM without serum and twice with cold Dulbecco's PBS containing calcium and magnesium. Cells were incubated twice for 25 min with 0.3 ml of freshly made biotinylation solution (1.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin, 10 mm ethanolamine, 2 mm CaCl2, 250 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) in either the upper or lower chamber. Transwells were washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS containing 100 mm glycine, incubated in a third wash for 20 min, and washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS. Transwell filters were incubated for 1 h in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1/1000 (v/v) aprotinin, 2 μm leupeptin, 4 μm pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and cells were scraped off. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and 50 μl of packed streptavidin-agarose beads were added to the supernatants, which were incubated overnight with rotation. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, twice with high salt buffer (lysis buffer with 500 mm NaCl), and once with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Proteins were eluted from the beads with 40 μl of SDS-urea loading buffer (4% SDS, 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 8 m urea), separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted.RNA Interference—A cDNA containing the canine Hax-1 coding region was generated from RNA-isolated MDCK cells by RT-PCR. The forward and reverse primers used were GAATGAGCGTCTTTGATCTTTTCCG and GTCCAGGATGGAAAAGGGATCATC, respectively. The siRNA target finder algorithm in the Ambion web site (www.ambion.com) was used to select 19-nucleotide oligomers in canine Hax-1 to be tested for RNA interference. A control 19-nucleotide sequence was generated that had the same G-C content as the selected oligomers but did not display sequence identity with Hax-1. BLAST analysis ensured that sequence identity between oligonucleotides and mammalian cDNAs in EST data bases was 15 nucleotides or less. The sequences chosen are as follows: 365, GCTTAAGTATCCAGATAGT; 427, GAAGTGAATCCTCCAAACC; 623, GATCACTAAGCCAGATGGG; 756, GCCCTGGATGATGCCTATT; and con, GTGTACAGCGATGTTGTCG. Double-stranded DNA fragments, which contained the selected RNAi sequences positioned downstream of the human U6 RNA polymerase III promoter, were generated by PCR using the Ambion Silencer Express kit and according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA fragments were cloned into the pSec vector (Ambion) and sequenced. MDCK II cells in 24-mm transwells were co-transfected with pEGFP and pSec derivatives (p365-756 and pCon). Two days later, cells were detached by trypsinization and passed 10 times through a 25-gauge needle. EGFP fluorescent cells and nontransfected cells were sorted, counted, and collected using a MOFLO (Dako-Cytomation) fluorescent-activated cell sorter. Equal numbers of cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g and lysed in SDS loading buffer. HAX-1 expression levels were determined by immunoblots using the BD Biosciences anti-HAX-1 monoclonal antibody.Pulse-Chase Labeling—MDCK cells cultured in 24-mm transwell filters were transfected as described above. Two days after transfection, cells were washed twice and incubated for 30 min with methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Transwells were placed on 0.15 ml of pulse media consisting of DMEM containing 1 mCi/ml [35S]cysteine/methionine (Amersham Biosciences Easytag NEG772) for 30 min. Cells were washed twice and transferred to wells containing chase media (DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum and cysteine and methionine at 180 mg/liter each). At specified time points, transwells were washed twice with ice-cold DMEM, and apical surface proteins were biotinylated as described above. Following PBS/glycine washes, membranes were excised from transwells, and cells were lysed by shaking for 1 h in 1.5 ml of 2× PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 40 mm octyl glucoside. Lysates were diluted to 10 ml with 2× PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. Cell extracts were incubated for 1 h with 50 μl of anti-rabbit IgG-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Beads were removed by centrifugation, and BSEP-EYFP was immunoprecipitated from pre-cleared lysates using an anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Abraxis) and anti-rabbit IgG-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed three times with 2× PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100. Immunoprecipitated BSEP-EYFP was released from anti-GFP antibody by boiling for 10 min in 75 μl of 1.5% SDS and diluted to 1.5 ml with lysis buffer. Biotinylated BSEP-EYFP was extracted by overnight incubation with streptavidin-agarose beads, which were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g and washed three times with lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted with 40 μl of SDS-urea loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid and exposed to phosphor screens for 2-7 days.Real Time RT-PCR—Replica 12-mm transwells containing MDCK cells were transfected on the same day and in the same manner as those used for biotinylation. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and RNA was isolated using 250 μl of TRIzol reagent according the manufacturer's instructions. RNA from each sample was treated with RNase-free DNase (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 37 °C. DNase was inactivated by a 20-min incubation with EDTA at 65 °C. First strand cDNA was generated in a 20-μl reaction containing 0.5 μg of DNA-free RNA and using oligo(dT) primers, Superscript II reverse transcriptase, and RNase H. Real time PCR was done by using 1 μl of the reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction and Hot Start SYBR green system (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amplification of PCR products was monitored in real time for 40 cycles by using Stratagene Mx4000 multiplex quantitative PCR instrument. Bsep primers were sense CGATGACCTCAGAAATAATCCTGG and antisense GCCGCAATGATGTTAGTGAAGG. Canine β-actin was used as a control with sense primer CGATGACCTCAGAAATAATCCTGG and antisense primer ATCCACGAGACCACCTTCAACTCC.RESULTSHAX-1 Binds the Linker Domains of MDR2, MDR1, and BSEP in Yeast—MDR-type proteins are composed of homologous halves that are connected by a cytoplasmic linker domain (Fig. 1A) (reviewed in Ref. 38Borst P. Elferink R.O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 537-592Google Scholar). A yeast two-hybrid screen, which used the rat MDR2 linker domain as bait, resulted in isolation of full-length Hax-1 cDNAs on three separate occasions. The rat Hax-1 nucleotide sequence exhibited 93 and 85% identity with mouse (GenBank™ accession number NM_011826) and human (GenBank™ accession number NM_006118) Hax-1 genes, respectively. The deduced rat HAX-1 protein (rHAX-1) sequence was 94 and 79% identical to mouse and human HAX-1 amino acid sequences, respectively.Fig. 1Interaction of HAX-1 with BSEP in yeast.A, diagram outlining the structure of MDR-type proteins. Hatched bars represent the 12 transmembrane helices (TM); the shaded boxes indicate the two nucleotide binding domains (NBD), and the black box represents the linker region (link). B, yeast two-hybrid interaction of HAX-1 with different bait chimeras. The pM49-8 plasmid, which contains the full-length rat Hax-1 cDNA in pMYR, was transformed into yeast with pSOS plasmids carrying rat Bsep (pSL47), Mdr2 (pSL49), and Mdr1a (pSL67) linker domains. Yeasts grown in liquid media at 25 °C were spotted on galactose (gal) or glucose (glu) solid media and incubated at 37 °C. Prey expression is under control of the Gal4 promoter, and no growth is expected on glucose media. Controls included empty pSOS vector and pSOS containing 40 amino acids from the amino terminus (pSL55) or 30 residues of the carboxyl terminus of MDR2 (pSL56). pSOS bait plasmids were also transformed into yeast in the company of the empty pMyr vector. C, mapping of the HAX-1 binding region in the MDR2 linker domain. Two-hybrid analyses were done with constructs expressing truncated versions of the MDR2 linker opposite the pMP49-8 plasmid, which expresses full-length rHAX-1. The thick boxes represent the 79-amino acid MDR2 linker. Plus and minus signs designate the relative growth of yeast in the two-hybrid system. All deletion constructs were co-transformed into yeast with the pMYR empty vector to test for false-positive growth. D, mapping of the HAX-1 binding region in the BSEP linker.

It did not enable growth of yeast carrying the empty pSOS vector, pSOS-Coll (a negative control that expresses amino acids 148-357 of murine type IV collagenase), or pSOS fusions containing the amino-terminal 40 amino acids of MDR2 (PSL55) or the carboxyl-terminal 35 residues of MDR2 (pSL56). Thus, rHAX-1 specifically interacts in yeast with the linker domains of three MDR subfamily members that reside in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes.HAX-1 Binds Amino Acid Motifs Proximal to t"

Cells with a deletion in the vacuolar iron/manganese transporter Ccc1p are sensitive to high iron. Overexpression of MRS3 or MRS4 suppresses the high iron sensitivity of Δccc1 cells. MRS3 and MRS4 have recently been suggested to encode mitochondrial iron transporters. We demonstrate that deletion of MRS3 and MRS4 severely affects cellular and mitochondrial metal homeostasis, including a reduction in cytosolic and mitochondrial iron acquisition. We show that vacuolar iron transport is increased in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells, resulting in decreased cytosolic iron and activation of the iron-sensing transcription factor Aft1p. Activation of Aft1p leads to increased expression of the high affinity iron transport system and increased iron uptake. Deletion of CCC1 in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells restores cellular and mitochondrial iron homeostasis to near normal levels. Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells also show increased resistance to cobalt but decreased resistance to copper and cadmium. These phenotypes are also corrected by deletion of CCC1 in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells. Decreased copper resistance in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells results from activation of Aft1p by Ccc1p-mediated iron depletion, as deletion of CCC1 or AFT1 in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells restores copper resistance. These results suggest that deletion of mitochondrial proteins can alter vacuolar metal homeostasis. The data also indicate that increased expression of the AFT1-regulated gene(s) can disrupt copper homeostasis.

The data also indicate that increased expression of the AFT1-regulated gene(s) can disrupt copper homeostasis. Two important aspects of cellular iron metabolism are localized to mitochondria, heme synthesis and iron-sulfur cluster synthesis. Both synthetic pathways require iron import into mitochondria, but little is known about mitochondrial transporters for either import or export of iron. Recent studies have shown that deletion of both MRS3 and MRS4, members of the mitochondrial carrier family, results in decreased mitochondrial iron content. Double deletion strains (Δmrs3Δmrs4) demonstrate a low iron growth defect and decreased heme and iron-sulfur cluster synthesis (1Foury F. Roganti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24475-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 2Muhlenhoff U. Stadler J.A. Richhardt N. Seubert A. Eickhorst T. Schweyen R.J. Lill R. Wiesenberger G.

Loss of Yfh1p leads to defects in iron-sulfur cluster synthesis (3Chen O.S. Hemenway S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Δyfh1 cells are protected from mitochondrial iron toxicity when MRS3 and MRS4 are deleted (1Foury F. Roganti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24475-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Deletion of these genes does not completely abrogate mitochondrial iron uptake, leading to the suggestion that they encode mitochondrial iron transporters whose function only becomes apparent under low iron conditions (2Muhlenhoff U. Stadler J.A. Richhardt N. Seubert A. Eickhorst T. Schweyen R.J. Lill R. Wiesenberger G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40612-40620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Other characteristics of Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells are inconsistent with a role for these genes simply as mitochondrial iron transporters, as broad effects on transition metal metabolism have been observed. In particular, Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells show increased cellular iron acquisition due to up-regulation of the iron regulon (1Foury F. Roganti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24475-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 2Muhlenhoff U. Stadler J.A. Richhardt N. Seubert A. Eickhorst T. Schweyen R.J. Lill R. Wiesenberger G.

Disruption of the MRS3/MRS4 homologue in Cryptococcus neoformans also leads to increased expression of iron transport genes (7Nyhus K.J. Ozaki L.S. Jacobson E.S. Med. Mycol. 2002; 40: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells show significant alterations in transition metal metabolism; Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells are more cobalt-resistant and more copper- and cadmium-sensitive than wild type cells (1Foury F. Roganti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24475-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We have examined how deletion of MRS3 and MRS4 affects cellular metal metabolism. We report that deletion of these genes leads to activation of the vacuolar iron transporter Ccc1p and the subsequent depletion of cytosolic iron. The decrease in cytosolic iron leads to activation of Aft1p and transcription of the iron regulon. Aft1p is an iron-sensing transcription factor that translocates to the nucleus when cells are iron-depleted (8Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ueta R. Fukunaka A. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18914-18919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 9Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Aft1p is responsible for the transcription of approximately 20 genes, among which are those that encode the high affinity iron transport system present on the plasma membrane. We further demonstrate that activation of Aft1p is responsible for the increase in copper toxicity and the decrease in cobalt toxicity. Overexpression of MRS3 or MRS4 suppresses the high iron toxicity in Δccc1 cells. These results demonstrate that MRS3 and MRS4 have roles beyond mitochondrial iron metabolism and suggest that alteration of mitochondrial activity can affect vacuolar function. Yeast Strains, Growth Media, and Plasmids—Yeast strains used in this study are shown in Table I. Cells were grown in CM, 1The abbreviations used are: CM, complete synthetic media; WT, wild type. a synthetic medium that includes yeast nitrogen base, amino acids, and glucose. When required, iron, copper, zinc, cadmium, and cobalt were supplemented at the concentrations indicated in each experiment. Iron-limited conditions were achieved by the addition of the impermeable iron chelator bathophenanthroline disulfonate. Where specified, low iron medium was supplemented with 0.2% Tween, 30 μg/ml ergosterol, and 56 μg/ml methionine.

The library was obtained from Dr. David Stillman (University of Utah) and has been described previously (12Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The library was transformed into Δccc1 cells. Plasmids were recovered and sequenced from cells capable of growing on 5 mm iron. Isolated plasmids were subcloned to identify the complementing gene. Transposon Insertion Library Screen—An mTn-3xHA/lacZ-mutagenized genomic library was a gift from Dr. M. Snyder (Yale University). Three pools of libraries were digested with NotI and transformed into Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells. Colonies were replicated on high copper plates (2 mm CuSO4). Candidates that grew on this toxic concentration of copper were isolated and transformed with YIp5. Genomic DNA recovered from these candidates was digested with Nsi1, ligated overnight, and transformed into Escherichia coli cells by electroporation. Rescued plasmids were amplified and sequenced, and the disrupted genes were identified as described previously (13Kumar A. Vidan S. Snyder M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Microarray Analysis—RNA was extracted from wild type, Δmrs3Δmrs4, and Δmrs3Δmrs4Δccc1 cells grown in CM media. Total RNA was isolated using standard techniques (14Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Purification of mRNA was performed using the Poly(A) Tract mRNA isolation system (Promega). Fabrication of DNA microarray, synthesis of fluorescent-labeled cDNA, hybridization of the microarrays, and subsequent scanning were performed in the Huntsman Cancer Institute Microarray Core Facility. Miscellaneous Procedures—Iron transport activity and iron content assays were performed as described (15Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). A FET3-LacZ construct was constructed and assayed as described previously (15Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). CTR1-LacZ and CUP1-LacZ constructs were obtained from Dr. Dennis Winge (University of Utah). Aconitase activity was assayed as described (3Chen O.S. Hemenway S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16922-16927Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Vacuoles were isolated as described previously (15Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Overexpression of MRS3 or MRS4 Suppresses Iron Sensitivity of Δccc1 by Reducing Cellular Iron Accumulation—Cells with a deletion in CCC1, which encodes a vacuolar iron and manganese transporter, are more sensitive to growth on high iron medium than wild type cells, presumably because of an inability to remove iron from the cytosol (15Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We screened for genes that when overexpressed could suppress the high iron sensitivity of Δccc1 cells. We identified two homologous genes, MRS3 and MRS4, capable of permitting Δccc1 cells to grow on high iron (Fig. 1A). These genes are members of the family of mitochondrial carriers and have been identified as putative mitochondrial iron transporters (1Foury F. Roganti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24475-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 2Muhlenhoff U. Stadler J.A. Richhardt N. Seubert A. Eickhorst T. Schweyen R.J. Lill R. Wiesenberger G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40612-40620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that MRS3/MRS4 prevented iron toxicity by reducing iron-induced oxidant damage. If this hypothesis is correct, then we might expect that anaerobiosis would reduce iron sensitivity. Incubation of cells under anaerobic conditions decreased the iron sensitivity of Δccc1 cells, as a higher concentration of iron was required to see a phenotype. Under anaerobic conditions, overexpression of either MRS3 or MRS4 in Δccc1 cells could no longer suppress the iron toxicity seen at the higher iron concentration (Fig. 1B). Although oxygen is required for protection by MRS3 or MRS4, respiration is not required, as overexpression of MRS3 or MRS4 could protect Δccc1 cells that are rho0 from iron toxicity (Fig. 1C). Overexpression of MRS3 or MRS4 could protect cells from iron toxicity by sequestering iron into mitochondria, as these genes are thought to encode mitochondrial iron transporters. We discovered, however, that overexpression of either gene in either Δccc1 (data not shown) or wild type cells resulted in a lower cellular iron content as assayed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 2A). Previously we had identified MMT1 and MMT2 as mitochondrial iron transporters (11Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28485-28493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These two genes encode members of the cation diffusion facilitator family localized to mitochondria, and overexpression of either of these transporters led to increased mitochondrial iron. In contrast to overexpression of MRS3 or MRS4, overexpression of MMT1 and/or MMT2 in Δccc1 cells increased iron toxicity (Fig. 1A) and, when overexpressed in wild type cells, increased cell-associated iron (Fig. 2A). Deletion of plasma membrane iron transport systems, either the high affinity (FET3) or low affinity (FET4) transport systems, both of which import iron into cells, did not rescue the iron sensitivity of Δccc1 cells (data not shown). Increasing cellular iron levels by the ectopic expression of FET4 through the use of a GAL4-driven plasmid, overcame the protection provided by overexpressed MRS3 or MRS4 (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that overexpression of MRS3 and MRS4 protects Δccc1 cells by reducing cellular iron accumulation and that the protective effect requires oxygen metabolism but not respiration. Deletion of MRS3 and MRS4 Increases Vacuolar Iron Accumulation and Induces Expression of the Iron Regulon—Microarray analysis of Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells showed increased transcription of many Aft1p-regulated genes, confirming previous work (1Foury F. Roganti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24475-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 2Muhlenhoff U. Stadler J.A. Richhardt N. Seubert A. Eickhorst T. Schweyen R.J.

These data were further supported by Northern analysis, which showed that Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells have increased levels of FET3 mRNA (data not shown) as well as increased expression of a reporter construct driven by the FET3 promoter (Fig. 3A). The increased expression of the iron regulon resulted in increased iron transport (Fig. 3B) and increased cellular iron (Fig. 3C).Table IIThe effect of deletion of CCC1 on gene transcription in Δmrs3 Δmrs4 cellsAverage ratio of expressionΔmrs3 Δmrs4:wild typeΔmrs3 Δmrs4 Δccc1:wild typeFIT29.532 ± 1.068FIT21.193 ± 0.507FIT39.413 ± 1.175FIT30.765 ± 0.421ARN35.335 ± 0.409ARN31.458 ± 0.547FET34.699 ± 0.452FET30.978 ± 0.495ARN44.509 ± 0.265ARN40.705 ± 0.649FRE14.082 ± 0.332FRE11.374 ± 0.233FTR13.462 ± 0.301FTR10.834 ± 0.701ARN23.184 ± 0.766ARN20.026 ± 0.005VMR12.736 ± 0.537VMR10.833 ± 0.045FRE32.664 ± 0.579FRE30.547 ± 0.567COT12.459 ± 0.500COT11.441 ± 0.191ARN12.192 ± 0.541ARN10.072 ± 0.012CCC22.145 ± 0.403CCC20.095 ± 0.013CTR11.640 ± 0.355CTR10.912 ± 0.218 Open table in a new tab To determine how deletion of MRS3 and MRS4 leads to increased cellular iron accumulation, we first examined the subcellular location of the accumulated iron. We predicted that if cellular iron couldn't enter the mitochondria due to deletion of the putative iron transporters Mrs3p and Mrs4p, then it might be stored in an organelle other than the mitochondria. Storage of iron would make it unavailable to the iron-sensing transcription factor Aft1p. This could occur through either through a direct reduction in cytosolic iron or by affecting the synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters in mitochondria, as the level of iron-sulfur clusters appears to regulate transcription of the iron-regulon (16Chen O.S. Crisp R.J. Valachovic M. Bard M. Winge D.R. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29513-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Our previous studies demonstrated that yeast store iron in the vacuole and that Ccc1p is a vacuolar protein that transports iron from the cytosol to the vacuole (15Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Vacuoles isolated from Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells showed an increase in iron content compared with vacuoles from wild type cells (Fig. 3D). Deletion of CCC1 in a Δmrs3Δmrs4 strain (Δmrs3Δmrs4Δccc1) reduced all of the increased parameters of cellular iron homeostasis, including FET3-LacZ reporter activity (Fig. 3A), cell surface iron transport (Fig. 3B), whole cell iron accumulation (Fig. 3C), and vacuolar iron accumulation (Fig. 3D). Transcript analysis showed that deletion of CCC1 in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells affects not only transcription of FET3 but other members of the iron regulon as well (Table II). Although all of the measures of iron accumulation are reduced, we note that the extent of the reduction varied for the different measures. These results suggest that increased transcription of the iron regulon in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells resulted in part from the increased activity of Ccc1p. We have shown that when CCC1 is overexpressed, vacuolar iron is increased, resulting in a decrease in cytosolic iron (10Chen O.S. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7626-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CCC1 leads to decreased mitochondrial aconitase activity (3Chen O.S. Hemenway S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16922-16927Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting that reduced cytosolic iron affects mitochondrial iron uptake and the synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that the decreased mitochondrial iron accumulation seen in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells grown in iron-replete media (1Foury F. Roganti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24475-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) resulted from an affect on Ccc1p activity. To test this hypothesis, we examined aconitase activity in a Δmrs3Δmrs4Δccc1 strain. We confirmed a previous report (1Foury F. Roganti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24475-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) showing that Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells have reduced aconitase activity (Fig. 4A). Decreased aconitase activity resulted from an effect of iron deprivation on iron-sulfur cluster synthesis in mitochondria. In a Δmrs3Δmrs4Δccc1 strain there was a return of aconitase activity to near normal levels. Incubation of Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells in high iron medium does not lead to the recovery of aconitase activity, whereas incubation of Δmrs3Δmrs4Δccc1 cells in high iron medium leads to supranormal aconitase activity (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that activated Ccc1p can deplete cytosolic iron even when cells are incubated in high iron medium and that loss of Ccc1p permits mitochondria to acquire iron even in the absence of Mrs3p and Mrs4p. Increased Ccc1p activity lowers cytosolic iron by sequestering iron in the vacuole. One consequence of decreased cytosolic iron is activation of the iron regulon, leading to increased iron transport across the plasma membrane as well as increased iron transport from the vacuole to the cytosol. Both the high affinity cell surface iron transporter system (Fet3p/Ftr1p) and the vacuolar iron export systems (Fet5p/Fth1p and Smf3p) are regulated by the iron-sensitive transcription factor Aft1p (17Portnoy M.E. Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, the increased activity of Ccc1p in depleting cytosolic iron should be partially offset by the increased export of iron from vacuole to cytosol. Deletion of AFT1 in a Δmrs3Δmrs4 strain should, therefore, lead to profound iron deprivation. This prediction was confirmed, as Δmrs3Δmrs4Δaft1 cells required high iron for growth (Fig. 5A) and show a profound decrease in mitochondrial aconitase activity (Fig. 5B). Deletion of CCC1 Restores Transition Metal Sensitivity in Δmrs3Δmrs4 Cells—A number of plate phenotypes have been reported for Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells (1Foury F. Roganti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24475-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the Δmrs3Δmrs4 strain shows increased sensitivity to Cd2+ and Cu+ and decreased sensitivity to Co2+ (Fig. 6). All of these metal sensitivities showed a greater (copper, Co2+) or lesser (Cd2+) reversion to the wild type phenotype when CCC1 was deleted. Furthermore, transformation of Δmrs3Δmrs4Δccc1 cells with a low copy CCC1 plasmid reverted the phenotype toward that of the Δmrs3Δmrs4 strain. These results indicate that disruption of transition metal homeostasis in the Δmrs3Δmrs4 strain is due to Ccc1p. We explored the basis of the increased copper sensitivity shown by the Δmrs3Δmrs4 strain. Measurement of cell-associated copper in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells by atomic absorption spectroscopy showed a 2-fold increase in copper concentration (data not shown). Normally, increased cytosolic copper activates the copper-sensing transcription factor Ace1p, resulting in the synthesis of the metallothionein genes CUP1-1 and CUP1-2 (for review, see Ref. 18Winge D.R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 165-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Metallothionein binds cytosolic copper and prevents copper toxicity. Examination of Ace1p activity in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells transformed with a CUP1-LacZ reporter construct showed that Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells have lower than normal levels of β-galactosidase activity, suggesting that cytosolic copper levels are low (Fig. 7A). This result was confirmed using cells transformed with a reporter construct driven by the promoter of the high affinity copper transporter CTR1. When cytosolic copper is low, transcription of CTR1 is increased by the Mac1p copper-sensing transcription factor (19Graden J.A. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 20Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells show increased expression of a CTR1-LacZ reporter construct, confirming reduced cytosolic copper levels (Fig. 7B). Deletion of CCC1 in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells returns copper homeostasis to near normal levels. Overexpression of CCC1 in wild type cells increases the expression of CTR1 reporter constructs, confirming Ccc1p alters copper homeostasis (Fig. 7C). Changes in Copper Metabolism Result from Ccc1p Activation of Aft1p—One interpretation of our results is that Ccc1p is a copper transporter, and decreased cytosolic copper results from an increase in vacuolar copper. Although we observed an increase in vacuolar copper in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells, increased copper was found in other membrane fractions such as mitochondria and Golgi (data not shown). We took a genetic approach to define the mechanism by which CCC1 alters copper homeostasis. We transformed Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells with a transposon library, selecting for mutations that permit growth on high copper. One of the mutants that grew on high copper contained a transposon, which destroyed the open reading frame of AFT1. Deletion of AFT1 in a Δmrs3Δmrs4 strain resulted in increased copper resistance (Fig. 8A). Deletion of AFT1 also abrogated the Co2+ resistance in wild type and Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells, confirming a recent report that Co2+ resistance was due to the expression of Aft1p-regulated genes (21Stadler J.A. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39649-39654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Transformation of wild type cells with an AFT1-1up allele results in increased expression of the CTR1-LacZ reporter construct (Fig. 8B) and increased toxicity to high copper (Fig. 8C). To determine the relationship between AFT1, CCC1, and copper homeostasis, we overexpressed CCC1 in a Δaft1 strain. As expected, overexpression of CCC1 increases CTR1 reporter activity in wild type cells. Expression of CCC1 in Δaft1 cells reduces the expression of the CTR1 reporter construct to near normal levels (Fig. 9A). This result suggests that the Ccc1p effect on copper homeostasis requires the expression of an Aft1p-regulated gene. To test this hypothesis we expressed a constitutive AFT1-1up allele in both wild type and Δccc1 strains. As expected, the AFT1-1up allele led to an increase in CTR1 reporter activity. Deletion of CCC1 in AFT1-1up cells did not affect the expression of CTR1-LacZ activity (Fig. 9B). Overexpression of CCC1 had no more effect than did the presence of the AFT1-1up allele (Fig. 9C). Collectively, these results suggest that Ccc1p is not a vacuolar copper transporter and that changes in copper metabolism result from Ccc1p-induced activation of Aft1p.Fig. 9Alterations in copper homeostasis result from the Ccc1p-induced activation of Aft1p target genes.A, wild type cells or Δaft1 cells were transformed with a CTR1-LacZ plasmid and a plasmid containing a MET3-regulated CCC1. Cells were incubated overnight in the presence (CCC1 off) or absence (CCC1 on) of methionine and β-galactosidase, and cell protein was determined. B, wild type and Δccc1 cells were transformed with a CTR1-LacZ plasmid and either a control plasmid or a plasmid containing the AFT1-1up allele. C, cells transformed with a CTR1lacZ plasmid were transformed with either a low copy plasmid containing AFT1-1up or a high copy plasmid containing MET3-regulated CCC1 or both plasmids. Cells were grown in methionine free medium before being assayed for β-galactosidase and cell protein. CTRL, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Deletion of CCC1 Does Not Restore the Low Iron Growth Defect of Δmrs3Δmrs4 Cells—Although deletion of CCC1 in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells restores copper, cadmium, and cobalt sensitivities to near wild type levels, it does not permit cells to grow on low iron medium; the low iron defect seen in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells is independent of vacuolar iron accumulation. The low iron defect due to the absence of Mrs3p and Mrs4p results from impaired mitochondrial activity, specifically reduced heme biosynthesis. The addition of Tween, methionine, and ergosterol to low iron media permits the growth of Δmrs3Δmrs4Δccc1 cells (Fig. 10). These additives supply metabolites that are the products of heme-based enzymes and which are missing in heme-deficient cells (22Bard M. Bruner D.A. Pierson C.A. Lees N.D. Biermann B. Frye L. Koegel C. Barbuch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Bypassing the heme requirement permits Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells to grow on low iron medium. Based on these results, we conclude that in low iron medium the absence of MRS3 and MRS4 leads to a reduction in mitochondrial heme production or export. Mutants have been identified that affect mitochondrial metal metabolism, but the specific biochemical function of the mutant or normal allele is unclear. This is particularly true for members of the mitochondrial carrier family. Many members of this family mediate anion transport across the mitochondrial membrane. The family includes citrate transporters, ATP/ADP exchangers, and succinate/fumarate exchangers (for review, see Ref. 23Kaplan R.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 179: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Deletion of these genes leads to marked changes in mitochondrial metal homeostasis. For example, deletion of the mitochondrial carrier YHM1 leads to mitochondrial iron accumulation (24Lesuisse E. Lyver E.R. Knight S.A. Dancis A. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 599-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yet Yhm1p appears to be a GTP/GDP exchanger (25Vozza A. Blanco E. Palmieri L. Palmieri F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20850-20857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It is not clear how defects in mitochondrial GTP levels would lead to increased mitochondrial iron accumulation. Deletion of two highly homologous members of the mitochondrial carrier family, MRS3 and MRS4, was shown to affect mitochondrial and cellular metal homeostasis. Foury and Rogati (1Foury F. Roganti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24475-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) show that deletion of these genes limited mitochondrial iron accumulation, leading to the hypothesis that these genes encode mitochondrial iron transporters. This hypothesis was supported by Muhlenhoff et al. (2Muhlenhoff U. Stadler J.A. Richhardt N. Seubert A. Eickhorst T. Schweyen R.J. Lill R. Wiesenberger G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40612-40620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), who assayed mitochondrial heme and Fe-S synthesis in both Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells and in cells that overexpressed MRS3 or MRS4. Their data are consistent with Mrs3p and Mrs4p functioning as mitochondrial iron transporters whose role only becomes apparent when cellular iron is limiting. However, protection of Δccc1 cells from iron toxicity by overexpression of MRS3/MRS4, resulting in lowered cellular iron levels, is not easy to reconcile with Mrs3p and Mrs4p being solely mitochondrial iron transporters. Other phenotypes shown by Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells, such as changes in copper and cobalt sensitivity and increased iron transport, are not easily ascribed to changes in mitochondrial iron transport, particularly when cells are incubated in iron-replete media. Plants and fungi, as opposed to other eucaryotes, store iron in the vacuole, as they do not synthesize cytosolic ferritin. Ccc1p was identified in two separate yeast genetic screens as a vacuolar iron and manganese transporter. Increased expression of CCC1 lowered the cytosolic concentration of both metals (15Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 26Lapinskas P.J. Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We suggest that deletion of MRS3/MRS4 affects Ccc1p activity leading to cytosolic iron depletion and that cytosolic iron depletion is responsible for most of the phenotypes seen in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells (see model Fig. 11). There are two major lines of evidence which suggest that deletion of MRS3/MRS4 increases Ccc1p activity. The first line of evidence is that overexpression of CCC1 mimics many of the phenotypes seen in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells. We discovered Ccc1p as a high copy suppressor able to prevent excessive mitochondrial iron accumulation in Δyfh1 cells (10Chen O.S. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7626-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A prerequisite for mitochondrial iron accumulation in Δyfh1 cells is high cytosolic iron (27Radisky D.C. Babcock M.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4497-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 28Foury F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Increased expression of CCC1 results in increased vacuolar iron storage, lowering cytosolic iron. Because cytosolic iron is the immediate precursor pool for mitochondrial iron acquisition, decreased cytosolic iron leads to decreased mitochondrial iron and prevents iron accumulation in Δyfh1 mitochondria (10Chen O.S. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7626-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CCC1 leads to increased cell surface iron transport and decreased mitochondrial aconitase activity (3Chen O.S. Hemenway S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16922-16927Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10Chen O.S. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7626-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The second line of evidence that supports an effect of MRS3/MRS4 deletion on Ccc1p activity is that deletion of CCC1 in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells restores iron and metal homeostasis to near normal values. We note that deletion of CCC1 does not restore all of the measures of iron homeostasis in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells to normal, suggesting that deletion of MRS3/MRS4 may affect other (vacuolar/cell surface) transporters in addition to Ccc1p. We do not know what metabolite(s) is generated in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells or how it affects Ccc1p. We do know that neither CCC1 mRNA nor protein levels are increased. We think that a specific metabolite alters the activity of Ccc1p because we have been unable to alter its activity by conditions that lead to increased cellular iron (e.g. high media iron) nor does increased cellular iron lead to the phenotypes seen in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells. Further evidence which suggests that Mrs3p and Mrs4p have effects that cannot simply be related to mitochondrial iron accumulation is that overexpression of Mmt1p and Mmt2p, other mitochondrial metal transporters, does not protect cells against iron toxicity or nor do they activate Ccc1p. Indeed, Muhlenhoff et al. (2Muhlenhoff U. Stadler J.A. Richhardt N. Seubert A. Eickhorst T. Schweyen R.J. Lill R. Wiesenberger G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40612-40620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) show that overexpression of MRS3 or MRS4 stimulated iron-sulfur cluster synthesis and that this stimulation could not be accounted for by increased iron transport. Their explanation for this stimulatory activity was that Mrs3p or Mrs4p may transport molecules other than ferrous iron. Our data show that many of the phenotypes in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells result from downstream consequences of reduced cytosolic iron, which activates the iron-sensitive transcription factor Aft1p. Increased cobalt resistance and decreased copper resistance both result from activation of Aft1p. Both metal sensitivities are returned to normal when either CCC1 or AFT1 is deleted. We have examined the effect of deletions of candidate genes in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells. We have not seen any suppression of the increased copper sensitivities upon deletion of such Aft1p target genes as CCC2, COT1, or VMR1. Perhaps multiple gene deletions are required to see a change in phenotype. Our data suggest that these target genes lead to reduced cytosolic copper and increased membrane-associated copper. It is this combination that prevents copper sequestration by metallothioneins, resulting in increased toxicity. Our studies suggest that iron can affect the expression of genes regulated by copper, as deletion of CCC1 in cells with an active Aft1p results in decreased cytosolic copper. Recently, Gross et al. (29Gross C. Kelleher M. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32310-32316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) show that high copper induced the iron regulon and that this effect required the copper-sensing transcription factor Ace1p. We speculate that when Aft1p is activated, particularly in the presence of iron, a protein encoded by an Aft1p-regulated gene transports copper into membrane compartments, leading to copper-deprived cytosol. Our data are not discrepant with a role for Mrs3p and Mrs4p in mitochondrial iron transport. Deletion of CCC1 does not suppress the inability of Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells to grow on low iron, consistent with the possibility that Mrs3p and Mrs4p may be mitochondrial iron transporters active under low iron conditions as previously suggested (1Foury F. Roganti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24475-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 2Muhlenhoff U. Stadler J.A. Richhardt N. Seubert A. Eickhorst T. Schweyen R.J.

The addition of Tween, ergosterol, and methionine, products of heme containing enzymes, suppresses the low iron growth defect resulting from deletion of MRS3 and MRS4. We think that in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells activation of Ccc1p lowers cytosolic iron, exacerbating the mitochondrial defect. We cannot rule out the possibility that deletion of MRS3 and MRS4 affects vacuolar transporters other than Ccc1p, and activation of these transporters exacerbates the low iron growth defect of Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells. We thank members of the Kaplan laboratory and Dr. James P. Kushner for help in editing this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2085549346,"Signaling through the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) is amplified and prolonged by coligation of the BCR to the CD19/CD21/CD81 coreceptor complex. Coligation is induced during immune responses by the simultaneous binding of complement-tagged antigens to the complement receptor, CD21, and to the BCR. Enhanced signaling is due in part to the ability of the CD19/CD21/CD81 complex to stabilize the BCR in sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains termed lipid rafts. The tetraspanin CD81 is essential for the raft-stabilizing function of the coreceptor. Here we show that coligation of the BCR and the CD19/CD21/CD81 complex leads to selective, rapid, and reversible palmitoylation of CD81 and that palmitoylation is necessary for the raft stabilizing function of the CD19/CD21/CD81 complex. Inducible palmitoylation may represent a novel mechanism by which tetraspanins function to facilitate lipid raft-dependent receptor signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2133849127,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate diverse signaling processes, including olfaction. G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are important regulators of G protein signal transduction that specifically phosphorylate activated GPCRs to terminate signaling. Despite previously described roles for GRKs in GPCR signal downregulation, animals lacking C. elegans G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (Ce-grk-2) function are not hypersensitive to odorants. Instead, decreased Ce-grk-2 function in adult sensory neurons profoundly disrupts chemosensation, based on both behavioral analysis and Ca2+ imaging. Although mammalian arrestin proteins cooperate with GRKs in receptor desensitization, loss of C. elegans arrestin-1 (arr-1) does not disrupt chemosensation. Either overexpression of the C. elegans Gα subunit odr-3 or loss of eat-16, which encodes a regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) protein, restores chemosensation in Ce-grk-2 mutants. These results demonstrate that loss of GRK function can lead to reduced GPCR signal transduction and suggest an important role for RGS proteins in the regulation of chemosensation."
https://openalex.org/W2049580786,"The peribacteroid membrane (PBM) surrounding nitrogen fixing rhizobia in the nodules of legumes is crucial for the exchange of ammonium and nutrients between the bacteria and the host cell. Digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), a galactolipid abundant in chloroplasts, was detected in the PBM of soybean (Glycine max) and Lotus japonicus. Analyses of membrane marker proteins and of fatty acid composition confirmed that DGDG represents an authentic PBM lipid of plant origin and is not derived from the bacteria or from plastid contamination. In Arabidopsis, DGDG is known to accumulate in extraplastidic membranes during phosphate deprivation. However, the presence of DGDG in soybean PBM was not restricted to phosphate limiting conditions. Complementary DNA sequences corresponding to the two DGDG synthases, DGD1 and DGD2 from Arabidopsis, were isolated from soybean and Lotus. The two genes were expressed during later stages of nodule development in infected cells and in cortical tissue. Because nodule development depends on the presence of high amounts of phosphate in the growth medium, the accumulation of the non-phosphorus galactolipid DGDG in the PBM might be important to save phosphate for other essential processes, i.e. nucleic acid synthesis in bacteroids and host cells."

Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 337-376Google Scholar, 2Barker P.D. Ferguson S.J. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 281-290Google Scholar). The c-type cytochromes are defined by the occurrence of heme covalently attached to the polypeptide via two thioether linkages between the vinyl groups of heme and the cysteine sulfhydryls in the apocytochrome (1Thöny-Meyer L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 337-376Google Scholar, 3Allen J.W. Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Ferguson S.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 255-266Google Scholar). A CXXCH 2The single letter amino acid code is used where X is any amino acid except cysteine. 2The single letter amino acid code is used where X is any amino acid except cysteine. sequence in the apocytochrome provides the thiols for formation of the thioether bonds, and the imidazole of the histidine residue serves as one of the axial ligands of the heme. Remarkably, three distinct assembly pathways, referred to as systems I, II, and III, have emerged through genetic analysis of c-type cytochrome maturation in bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria (for review, see Refs. 1Thöny-Meyer L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 337-376Google Scholar and 4Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Google Scholar, 5Xie Z. Merchant S. Biochim.

Trans. 2002; 30: 633-638Google Scholar), an unexpected finding for what appears on the surface to be a rather simple chemical reaction (i.e. the addition of apocytochrome cysteine thiols to the vinyls of heme). Each system can be distinguished on the basis of a sequence relationship of specific assembly factors. Yet, there is an underlying assumption that the three systems are united by common biochemical requirements for holocytochrome c biogenesis (for review, see Refs. 2Barker P.D. Ferguson S.J. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 281-290Google Scholar, 4Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Google Scholar, and 8Ferguson S.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 629-640Google Scholar). For instance, the need for reducing conditions appears to be inherent to the chemistry of thioether bond formation (4Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Google Scholar). Both substrates, apocytochrome c sulfhydryls and heme, need to be maintained reduced prior to the ligation of heme as indicated from in vitro and in organello experiments (for review, see Refs. 4Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Google Scholar and 9Allen J.W.A. Barker P.D. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52075-52083Google Scholar). In bacteria, c-type cytochromes are assembled in the periplasm via system I or system II (10Kranz R.G. Beckett C.S. Goldman B.S. Res. Microbiol. 2002; 153: 1-6Google Scholar, 11O'Brian M.R. Thöny-Meyer L. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2002; 46: 257-318Google Scholar). In the bacterial periplasm, a disulfide bond formation machinery (Dsb system in Gram-negative and Bdb system in Gram-positive) promotes the oxidative folding of proteins, which is counter to the requirement for apocytochrome cysteinyl thiols in the heme attachment reaction (12Ortenberg R. Beckwith J. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 403-411Google Scholar, 13Kadokura H. Katzen F. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 111-135Google Scholar). The current thinking is that apocytochromes c upon translocation to the p-side are first a substrate of the Dsb/Bdb system which introduces intramolecular disulfides between the two cysteines of the CXXCH sequence. Subsequently, the disulfide bond undergoes reduction to provide free sulfhydryls that are competent to react with heme. The requirement for redox chemistry in the context of in vivo cytochrome c assembly was appreciated through the discovery in bacteria of thiol-metabolizing components in systems I and II that constitute a transmembrane thio-reduction pathway (12Ortenberg R. Beckwith J. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 403-411Google Scholar, 13Kadokura H. Katzen F. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 111-135Google Scholar, 14Fabianek R.A. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 303-316Google Scholar). The components of this pathway include a sulfhydryldisulfide membrane transporter that conveys reducing power from the cytoplasm to the periplasmic space and a dedicated membrane-anchored thioredoxin that reduces the heme binding site of apocytochrome c prior to the heme attachment (13Kadokura H. Katzen F. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 111-135Google Scholar, 14Fabianek R.A. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 303-316Google Scholar, 15Ritz D. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 21-48Google Scholar). Plastid c-type cytochromes are assembled through system II (5Xie Z. Merchant S. Biochim. Biophys.

Dreyfuss B.W. Xie Z. Gabilly S.T. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2593-2603Google Scholar), but the requirement for redox chemistry in cytochrome maturation has remained so far largely unexplored in this organelle. We suspected the operation of a redox subpathway in the plastid cytochrome assembly based on the occurrence of a CcdA homolog encoded in the plastid genome of a red alga, Porphyra purpurea, and in the nuclear genomes of green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and vascular plant Arabidopsis thaliana. CcdA is related to the DsbD/DipZ family of membrane polytopic proteins (22Kimball R.A. Martin L. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2003; 5: 133-149Google Scholar) that functions in transmembrane transfer of thiol-reducing equivalents from the bacterial cytoplasm to the periplasm (12Ortenberg R. Beckwith J. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 403-411Google Scholar, 13Kadokura H. Katzen F. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 111-135Google Scholar, 23Le Brun N.E. Bengtsson J. Hederstedt L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 638-650Google Scholar). Loss-of-function of CcdA in bacteria results in a pleiotropic deficiency in c-type cytochromes, presumably because of a block in the reduction of apocytochrome c thiols in the heme binding site (24Schiött T. Throne-Holst M. Hederstedt L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4523-4529Google Scholar, 25Schiött T. von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1962-1973Google Scholar, 26Deshmukh M.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1423-1429Google Scholar). Interestingly, CcdA is physically linked to a gene encoding a homolog of Ccs1, a system II-specific cytochrome c biogenesis (19Dreyfuss B.W. Hamel P.P. Nakamoto S.S. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2604-2613Google Scholar) in P. purpurea, Mycobacterium spp., and several cyanobacteria (6Nakamoto S.S. Hamel P. Merchant S. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 603-614Google Scholar). This gene clustering speaks to a role for CcdA in the plastid cytochrome c maturation pathway, but no biochemical or genetic evidence is presently available to assign a function to the plant or cyanobacterial CcdAs. In this work, we investigated the function of Arabidopsis CCDA in plastid cytochrome c assembly. In vitro import experiments and topological analysis using PhoA and LacZ established that the CCDA polypeptide is a polytopic membrane protein that is targeted to the plastid organelle. We have isolated T-DNA and Ds (dissociation) element insertions in the CCDA gene and shown that loss-of-function alleles resulted in photosynthetic incompetence at the level of cytochrome b6f assembly. We propose that impaired accumulation of cytochrome b6f is a consequence of a defect in holocytochrome f maturation, a c-type cytochrome resident in the plastid lumen. We hypothesize that CCDA is a component of a thylakoid transmembrane thioreduction pathway that operates in the delivery of reducing equivalents to apocytochrome f prior to its conversion to the holoform. Bacterial Strains and Molecular Biology Techniques—Bacterial strain Escherichia coli XL1-Blue and DH5-α were used as hosts for recombinant techniques. Strain LMG194 (phoA–) was used to measure PhoA activity of the sandwich constructs, and strain CC118 (phoA–lacZ–) was used to measure PhoA and LacZ activities. The sources of DNAs used in this work are provided in the on-line supplement. Constructs for Chloroplast Import Experiments—The AtCCDA, NAtCCDA-DHFR, 3The abbreviations used are: DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; kanr, kanamycin-resistant; kans, kanamycin-sensitive; MS medium, Murashige & Skoog medium; ORF, open reading frame; RT, reverse transcription. and N-AtPC-DHFR constructions were designed in the pGEM2 vector. AtCCDA corresponds to the entire ORF of the CCDA gene. N-AtCCDA-DHFR expresses the first 141 amino acids of Arabidopsis CCDA fused to the entire coding sequence of the mouse DHFR. N-AtPC-DHFR was engineered by fusing the sequence encoding the 77 amino acids of the plastocyanin chloroplast-targeting sequence plus the first 5 residues of the mature protein to the DHFR sequence. All gene fusions were under the control of the SP6 promoter that enables in vitro transcription. The details of the molecular cloning are described in the supplemental material. Chloroplast Import Experiments—In vitro protein import reactions were performed with chloroplasts isolated from pea seedlings (29Hofmann N.R. Theg S.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 53: 643-654Google Scholar). Radiolabeled proteins were translated in wheat germ extract (Promega). Reactions were performed in the light for 20 min prior to thermolysin treatment (29Hofmann N.R. Theg S.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 53: 643-654Google Scholar). Construction of CCDA-phoA, CCDA-lacZ, and CCDA-phoA Sandwich Fusions—Plasmid pRGK200 (30Monika E.M. Goldman B.S. Beckman D.L. Kranz R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 679-692Google Scholar) was used to generate seven CCDA-phoA and seven CCDA-lacZ translational fusions (I–VII) by a PCR-based strategy. The phoA sandwich fusion approach consists of the design of fusion proteins where PhoA is inserted into an otherwise intact target protein (31Ehrmann M. Boyd D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7574-7578Google Scholar). Two CCDA-phoA sandwich fusions carrying an insertion of phoA into CCDA at position 202 (SWA) or 242 (SWB) of the CCDA protein were constructed in the expression vector pBAD22, a plasmid that harbors an arabinose-inducible phoA gene (32Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Scopus (3886) Google Scholar). The details of the molecular cloning are provided in the supplemental material. Measurement of PhoA and LacZ Activities—PhoA assays were performed as described previously in (33Brickman E. Beckwith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 96: 307-316Google Scholar), except that isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was not used for induction. LacZ activity was measured as detailed in Ref. 34Kranz R.G. Haselkorn R. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 40: 203-215Google Scholar. PhoA assays of the sandwich fusions were performed on overnight grown cultures supplemented with 100 μm l-arabinose for induction. PhoA activity expressed in Miller units was calculated using Equation 1, PhoA activity=(1,000*A420nm)/(t*A600nm) (Eq. 1) where t is time in minutes. LacZ activity is expressed in units and was calculated by Equation 2, LacZ activity=(1,000*(A420 nm−(1.75*A550 nm))/(t*A600 nm) (Eq. 2) where t is time in minutes. Growth of A. thaliana—Col-0 seeds originated from Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX. Plants were propagated on solid minimal media comprising either the commercial soluble fertilizer Peters Professional General Purpose 20-10-20 (35Pollock M.A. Oppenheimer D.G. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 254-257Google Scholar) (Western Farm Services) or 0.5× Murashige & Skoog (MS) minimal medium, solidified with 0.8% (w/v) Select agar (Invitrogen), and containing 0.5 or 5% sucrose, or on a soil mix (Sunshine Professional Basic Mix 2; Sun Gro, Canada). Plants were grown at 24 ± 0.5 °C under white light (80–120 μE/m2/s) with a light/dark cycle of 16/8 h. Extraction of Plant Genomic DNA and mRNAs—A. thaliana genomic DNA for Southern hybridization was prepared as described in Ref. 36Lukowitz W. Gillmor C.S. Scheible W.-R. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 795-806Google Scholar, except that plant material was frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a powder prior to extraction. For PCR amplification, genomic DNAs were extracted as in Ref. 37Klimyuk V.I. Carroll B.J. Thomas C.M. Jones J.D. Plant J. 1993; 3: 493-494Google Scholar. Total RNA from plants was isolated with an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) starting from 100 mg of plant tissue according to the manufacturer's procedure. Following the elution step, purified RNAs were treated for 1 h with RNase-free DNase (Stratagene) to remove any contaminating genomic DNA and phenol-chloroform extracted. To confirm the absence of any contaminating DNA, 50 ng of RNA was subjected to a PCR amplification using the same primers that were used in the RT-PCR analysis. PCR and RT-PCR Amplifications—PCR amplifications performed as part of the University of Wisconsin-Madison screening process were carried out using TAKARA Ex-Taq under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The reverse transcription reaction was performed using the RT system (Promega); see the supplemental material. Screening and Molecular Characterization of ccda Mutant Lines— The PCR-based service provided by the Arabidopsis Knockout Facility at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center was used to screen 60,480 T-DNA insertion lines, and one insertion in the CCDA gene was identified (ccda-1). The ET5250 line carrying a Ds element insertion (ccda-2), the SALK_025766 line (ccda-3) and SALK_014416 line (ccda-4), both harboring a T-DNA insertion in CCDA, were identified through querying data bases of sequenced insertion sites (Cold Spring Harbor laboratory and Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory, respectively). The details of the screening and molecular characterization of the mutant lines are available in the supplemental material. Fluorescence Measurements—The fluorescence imaging system, Fluorcam 700 MF (Photon Systems Instruments Ltd.), was used to record chlorophyll fluorescence induction and decay kinetics of Arabidopsis plants that had been dark-adapted for at least 5 min. Plants were illuminated for 20 s under actinic light of 50 μE/m2/s. Emitted fluorescence was captured by the camera, and the collected data were converted into a graph using Excel software (Microsoft). Protein Preparation and Analysis—To extract proteins, plant tissue was frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground to a powder, and ground further in ice-cold extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA). The homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the pellets, enriched in membrane proteins, were washed twice and resuspended in extraction buffer (0.5–2.0 ml/g of fresh tissue). Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (38Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Google Scholar). In-gel heme stain of holocytochome f was performed using TMBZ (39Quinn J.M. Merchant S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 263-279Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of proteins separated by SDS-PAGE was performed as in Ref. 40Page M.D. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 653-661Google Scholar, except that samples were heated at 37 °C for 30 min. Antibody dilutions were 1:1,000 for anti-CF1 (spinach), anti-Cox1, anti-cyt f, anti-subunit IV/PetD (C. reinhardtii), and anti-HCF164 (A. thaliana); 1:2,000 for anti-Sec12 (A. thaliana) and anti-cyt b6 (C. reinhardtii); and 1:3,000 for anti-Rieske FeS (maize). A 1:3,000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was used as the secondary antibody. Sample loading was adjusted so that each sample contained the same amount of the α subunit of CF1. Quantitation of the bands was performed using a MultiImage system running ChemImager 4400 software (Alpha Innotec). A Homolog of Prokaryotic Thiol Disulfide Transporter CcdA in Photosynthetic Eukaryotes—We had noted the occurrence of a CcdA-encoding gene in the plastid genome of a rhodophyte alga, P. purpurea and also in the genomes of several cyanobacteria (6Nakamoto S.S. Hamel P. Merchant S. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 603-614Google Scholar). With red algal CcdA as our prototype, we searched the nucleotide sequence data bases and identified expressed sequence tags corresponding to CcdA-like proteins from a number of photosynthetic eukaryotes, including Chlamydomonas, Arabidopsis, and several other vascular plants. 4Descurainia sophia, Glycine max, Hordeum vulgare, Lotus japonicus, and Medicago truncatula (TBLASTN scores ranged from 10–17 to 10–55). A full-length cDNA was identified for each and sequenced. 5GenBank™ accession numbers: C. reinhardtii, AAL84598; A. thaliana, AAF35369; D. sophia, AAQ95739; G. max, AAP81162; H. vulgare, AAO16019; L. japonicus, AAO16018; and M. truncatula, AAO16020. A multiple alignment of the conceptual protein sequences (see Fig. 1 in the supplemental data) confirmed that the two cysteines that are essential for the redox activity of bacterial CcdA (26Deshmukh M. Brasseur G. Daldal F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 123-138Google Scholar) are invariant in the plant homologs and revealed that all display an N-terminal extension relative to the plastid-encoded and prokaryotic CcdA proteins, suggesting plastid localization of the nucleus-encoded plant homologs. All eukaryotic CCDAs displayed the features of polytopic membrane proteins with six predicted transmembrane segments when analyzed in silico for the presence of hydrophobic domains (Fig. 1 in the supplemental data). To assess the function of plant CCDA, three specific questions were addressed: 1) Where is CCDA localized? 2) What is its topological arrangement? and 3) What is the phenotype of loss-of-function ccda plants? Arabidopsis CCDA Is Targeted to the Plastid—The direct approach of immunolocalizing CCDA polypeptide after cell fractionation was not successful because the antisera we raised reacted very weakly if at all with native CCDA, perhaps because it is a low abundance hydrophobic protein (data not shown). Therefore, we chose to localize the in vitro synthesized radiolabeled protein after in vitro import into pea chloroplasts. We certainly expected CCDA to localize to chloroplasts based on the occurrence of the gene in the less derived red algal plastid genome of P. purpurea (6Nakamoto S.S. Hamel P. Merchant S. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 603-614Google Scholar). Indeed, AtCCDA could be imported into isolated chloroplasts and was processed to the mature form, suggesting that the N-terminal extension functions as a chloroplast-targeting presequence in vitro (Fig. 1A). We further solidified this model by showing that the 141-amino acid N-terminal extension on CCDA could target a passenger protein like the widely used reporter, DHFR, to the chloroplast in vitro (Fig. 1B). As a positive control for import, we used the 77-amino acid targeting sequence of plastocyanin, a known thylakoid lumen resident protein. As expected, the targeting sequence of plastocyanin is able to drive import of DHFR into the chloroplast (Fig. 1C). We concluded that CCDA is targeted to the chloroplast via its N-terminal extension and that its plastid location is compatible with a function in chloroplast cytochrome c biogenesis. Plastid CCDA Is a Polytopic Membrane Protein with Within-membrane Invariant Cysteines—To verify experimentally the predicted six-transmembrane segment model for chloroplast CCDA and, in particular, to locate the two universally conserved cysteines, we used PhoA and LacZ as topological reporters in bacteria. This approach relies on the topological analogy in a bioenergetic sense between the p-side and n-side compartments in bacteria (periplasm/cytoplasm) and those in plastids (lumen/stroma) and is justified by the previous establishment of its reliability for the analysis of CcsA, a thylakoid membrane polytopic protein (21Hamel P.P. Dreyfuss B.W. Xie Z. Gabilly S.T. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2593-2603Google Scholar). Translational fusions between CCDA and PhoA or LacZ were engineered at predicted periplasmic and cytoplasmic loops. The topology was deduced on the basis of measured LacZ and PhoA activities of the fusions proteins expressed in E. coli (Fig. 2 and Table I). High PhoA activities indicate a p-side location for the insertion site of the fusion because PhoA is active only in the periplasm. Reciprocally, fusions with high LacZ activity confirm association of the α and ω fragments of LacZ in the cytoplasm, and therefore an n-side location of the fusion site can be deduced. Location of the third extramembrane loop to the n-side or the p-side of the membrane could not be ascertained because both CCDA-PhoA and CCDA-LacZ fusions at position 236 of the polypeptide display high enzymatic activity (Table I, see fusion IV). We have ruled out that this is the result of a position effect at this particular site because fusions at positions 243, 249, and 254 in CCDA, all predicted to be located on the n-side, also led to high PhoA activity (data not shown). To overcome the ambiguity concerning the location of the third loop, we exploited the so-called sandwich approach, which offers greater reliability for examining membrane protein topology (31Ehrmann M. Boyd D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7574-7578Google Scholar). In this method, PhoA is inserted in an otherwise intact CCDA protein (see arrows marked SW in Fig. 2). The measurement of PhoA activity of sandwich constructs SWA and SWB yielded a definitive placement of the third loop to the stromal n-side (Table I). Using an anti-PhoA antibody, we were able to detect the CCDA-PhoA sandwich protein in the membrane fraction of bacterial cells expressing the SWA construct (data not show). We could not detect the CCDA-PhoA sandwich protein expressed from the SWB construct, suggesting that the protein is not stable and undergoes degradation. This has been observed for fusion proteins where the cytoplasmic form of the alkaline phosphatase often fails to fold into a stable structure (26Deshmukh M. Brasseur G. Daldal F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 123-138Google Scholar, 41Sarsero J. Pittard A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 297-306Google Scholar). The experimentally deduced model is in agreement with the topological prediction and consists of a six-transmembrane protein with N and C termini on the lumen side.Table ICCDA-PhoA and -LacZ activitiesPhoA activityLacZ activityTopologyMiller unitsunitsI218 ± 2059 ± 20p-sideII55 ± 81224 ± 149n-sideIII1468 ± 14216 ± 5p-sideIV289 ± 7614,520 ± 400?V888 ± 37<0.01p-sideVI<0.0512,821 ± 1,766n-sideVII212 ± 38<0.01p-sideSWA344 ± 11NAp-sideSWB10 ± 1NAn-side Open table in a new tab Identification of Mutants with T-DNA and Ds Element Insertions in the CCDA Gene—To assess plant CCDA function, we sought next to take a reverse genetic approach. This was facilitated by the possibility to screen for T-DNA inserts in genes of interest in Arabidopsis (42Sussman M.R. Amasino R.M. Young J.C. Krysan P.J. AustinPhillips S.

Four candidate ccda mutant lines corresponding to one enhancer trap line with a Ds element (44Martienssen R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the mammalian mitochondrial matrix, electron transferring flavoprotein (ETF) 1The abbreviations used are: ETF, electron transferring flavoprotein; MCAD, medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; IVD, isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase; GCDH, glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase; TMADH, trimethylamine dehydrogenase; DCIP, dichloroindophenol; ACO, acyl-CoA oxidase. links the activity of no less than 10 different dehydrogenases to the respiratory chain by accepting and subsequently transferring electrons to the membrane-bound ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (1Thorpe C. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. II. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 471-486Google Scholar). ETF therefore plays a role akin to the function of cytochrome c in the intermembrane space of mitochondria. Mitochondrial flavoprotein partners of ETF include the four fatty acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (very long chain, long chain, medium chain (MCAD), and short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases) involved in mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids; isovaleryl-CoA (IVD), glutaryl-CoA (GCDH), and isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenases involved in amino acid catabolism; and sarcosine and dimethylglycine dehydrogenase involved in 1-carbon metabolism (1Thorpe C. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. II. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 471-486Google Scholar). Defects in ETF or ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase give rise to the human inherited metabolic disease glutaric acidemia type II (2Goodman S.I. Binard R.J. Woonter M.R. Frerman F.E. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 77: 86-90Google Scholar). In this disease, electron transfer from the primary flavoprotein dehydrogenases to the main respiratory chain is impaired. Likewise, defects in the primary dehydrogenases often cause similar and lethal effects (3Bartlett K. Eaton S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 462-469Google Scholar). MCAD deficiency is the most frequently diagnosed mitochondrial β-oxidation defect in populations of northwestern European origin. This potentially fatal disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion (carrier frequency around 1 in 70) and may affect as many as 1 in 10,000 newborns. Although the primary dehydrogenases involved in fatty acid breakdown and amino acid catabolism share a common evolutionary origin and thereby retain highly similar structural features (4Kim J.J. Battaile K.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 721-728Google Scholar), the flavin dehydrogenases involved in 1-carbon metabolism are structurally and evolutionarily distinct enzymes (5Leys D. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4038-4048Google Scholar). In addition, the membrane-bound ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase is unrelated to either of these dehydrogenase families. The wide range of structurally different partners thus suggests a certain level of promiscuity in ETF binding, similar to that observed with cytochrome c. However, unlike the relatively small 12-kDa electron carrier cytochrome c, the 60-kDa ETF shows a remarkable specificity for its physiological partners. It is therefore intriguing that ETF manages to reconcile these contrasting properties of promiscuity and specificity. ETFs are heterodimeric proteins that fold into three distinct domains; the FAD is bound noncovalently to domain II, which sits in a shallow bowl created by domains I and III (6Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14355-14360Google Scholar). Recent models constructed using the known crystal structures of human ETF and its partner human MCAD have suggested that electron transfer from MCAD to ETF requires rotational movement of the ETF FAD domain (7Chohan K.K. Jones M. Grossmann J.G. Frerman F.E. Scrutton N.S. Sutcliffe M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34142-34147Google Scholar). Also, the recent structure determination of ETF from the bacterium Methylophilus methylotrophus in complex with its partner trimethylamine dehydrogenase (TMADH) reveals a highly dynamic protein-protein interface in which the FAD domain of ETF samples the available space within the complex (8Leys D. Basran J. Talfournier F. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 219-225Google Scholar). This diffusional motion within the complex is restricted by the static component of the interaction: a small hydrophobic interface centered on the ETF conserved residue Leuβ194. Although TMADH shares no significant structural similarity with any of the human ETF partners, a similar dual mode of interaction for the human ETF complexes could explain how human ETF retains both specificity (via the Leuβ195 interaction in domain III) and promiscuity (via the flexible FAD domain). To determine the structural basis of the interaction between human ETF and its partners, we have elucidated the crystal structure of the human ETF·MCAD complex at 2.9 Å resolution. This structure has led us in turn to further investigate the properties of the observed contact areas by studying mutant forms of MCAD and ETF. Remarkably, the interprotein interface of the human ETF·MCAD complex shares many essential structural features with the bacterial ETF·TMADH complex, despite the very different overall structures of MCAD and TMADH. Both crystal structures, together with the obtained solution data for the mutant human ETF and MCAD forms, reveal a conserved and dual interaction mode for ETF. The static part of this interaction confers ETF specificity, whereas the mobile section allows for the observed promiscuity. Extensive domain motion in the ETF-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase complexes is therefore needed to drive the catabolism of fatty acids. Crystallogenesis and Data Collection—A solution of a 1:1 mixture of recombinant human ETF and MCAD tetramer was prepared and used for subsequent crystallization trials. Crystals of the ETF·MCAD complex were grown using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. The reservoir solution contained 16% polyethylene glycol 5000 monoethyl ether, 50 mm sodium thiocyanate, and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5. The crystals were flash-cooled in oil, and a full 2.9 Å data set was collected on a single P212121 crystal at ID29, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble France). The data were processed and scaled with the HKL package programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (9Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar). The data statistics are given in Table I.Table IOverview of data collection and refinement statistics for the ETF-MCAD crystalsData collection statisticsSpace groupP212121Unit cell (Å)a = 94.3, b = 101.3, c = 244.7Resolution (Å)20-2.9 (3.0-2.9)Completeness (%)96.8 (86.4)Rmerge0.102 (0.391)I/σI12.6 (3.2)Unique reflections49,177Refinement statisticsResolution (Å)20-2.9 (3.0-2.9)Rfac0.191 (0.30)Rfree0.263 (0.45)Atoms14,998Mean B factor (Å2)42.4Root mean square deviation bond lengths (Å)0.020Root mean square deviation bond angles (°)2.010Ramachandran plotAllowed region (%)90.8Additional allowed region (%)9.1 Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The program AMoRe (10Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Google Scholar) was used to search for a molecular replacement solution using the available crystal structures for human MCAD and ETF (Protein Data Bank codes 1EGD and 1EFV). Only domains I and III of human ETF were used as the search model. For both search models a clear solution was found, and the initial phases were of sufficient quality to define unambiguously changes in the complex structure with respect to the search models. Positional and isotropic B factor refinement was performed using REFMAC5 (11Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Google Scholar) with alternative rounds of manual rebuilding of the complex model. Tight NCS symmetry restraints on the MCAD tetramer were imposed during the initial cycles of refinement but were removed in the final cycles. The final refinement statistics are given in Table I. Protein Production and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The plasmids encoding MCAD (pTrc99c), hETF (pK18), and IVD (pKK223-3) were kindly supplied by S. Ghisla and J. Vockley. The plasmids were transformed into JM109 cells (Stratagene). Wild-type and mutant enzymes were grown in 2YT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (MCAD and IVD) or 34 μg/ml kanamycin (hETF) at 35 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 1 followed by a 12-h induction at 25 °C with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were lysed by sonication, and the extracts were clarified with 0-40% ammonium sulfate. The enzymes were purified using anionic chromatography (DE52 and QSepharose) and hydroxyapatite columns. The enzymes were stored in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10% glycerol at -80 °C. The mutants were generated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and verified by automated DNA sequencing. Steady State Assays—Acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase activity was determined at 25 °C using a modification of the DCIP reduction method of Okamura-Ikeda et al. (12Okamura-Ikeda K. Ikeda Y. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1338-1345Google Scholar). The reactions were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 50 μm octanoyl-CoA or isovaleryl-CoA (for MCAD and IVD assays, respectively), 60 μm DCIP with either 3.3 mm phenazine methosulfate or 2 μm hETF as intermediate electron acceptors. Reduction of DCIP was monitored continuously at 600 nm. Structure of the ETF·MCAD Complex—The crystal structure of the human ETF·MCAD complex reveals a single ETF molecule interacting with a MCAD homotetramer in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1A). Although no solution data are available on the correct stoichiometry of the complex, a putative complex with four ETF molecules decorating the central MCAD tetramer can be constructed by applying the 222-fold symmetry of MCAD to the ETF partner. Any one of the resulting four ETF molecules does not impede binding of the other three, nor does it obstruct entry to the four fatty acyl-CoA-binding sites. It seems likely, therefore, that in solution up to four ETF molecules can interact with a single MCAD tetramer at any given time. The most striking observation is the total lack of any significant electron density for the FAD domain (domain II) of ETF in the complex. However, SDS-PAGE analysis of the crystalline complex reveals that the lack of density for the FAD domain does not arise from proteolysis, because only full-length ETF subunits are observed (Fig. 1B), illustrating that the FAD domain is highly disordered in the complex. To establish whether these crystals retain catalytic activity, a DCIP dye-linked reduction assay was used. DCIP is converted from the oxidized blue form to the reduced colorless state via ETF-mediated electron transfer from MCAD; DCIP is not reduced by MCAD/substrate alone. ETF·MCAD crystals mounted in capillaries in a 10-μl crystallization solution containing the substrate octanoyl-CoA and the terminal electron acceptor DCIP catalyze, albeit slowly, the reduction of DCIP by octanoyl-CoA, a process that could be followed using microspectrophotometry (Fig. 1C). This observation demonstrates that the crystalline complex and the observed inherent disorder of the FAD domain are physiologically relevant. The ordered region of ETF interacts solely through the β-subunit with the N-terminal α-helical domain of a single MCAD monomer, consistent with published cross-linking experiments that have revealed a preferential cross-linking of the ETF β-subunit to both MCAD and membrane-bound ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (13Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 519-524Google Scholar, 14Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 869-876Google Scholar). The total buried interfacial surface visible for the crystallographically ordered atoms is 536 Å2 and covers only 4.3 and 3.2% of the accessible surface of an MCAD monomer and ETF, respectively. That this interaction surface is rather small, albeit highly complementary (shape correlation statistic (15Lawrence M.C. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 946-950Google Scholar) of 0.704), is consistent with kinetic data that suggest a weakly interacting system (16Ikeda Y. Okamura-Ikeda K. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1311-1325Google Scholar, 17Salazar D. Zhang L. deGala G.D. Frerman F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26425-26433Google Scholar). Central to the interaction of ETF with MCAD is the polypeptide stretch between residues β191 and β200, termed the “recognition loop”; this comprises the initial turn of an α-helix and the immediate preceding loop region (Fig. 2, A and B). This α-helix of ETF interacts with the MCAD surface, thereby extending α-helix C of MCAD, with nearly perfect alignment of the axes, and corresponding dipoles, of both helices. The close proximity of the N-terminal region of this α-helix of ETF and the C-terminal region helix C of MCAD is facilitated by the sharp turn of the polypeptide chain in both molecules. A single hydrogen bond is made between the backbone oxygen of the conserved Gly60 on MCAD and the backbone nitrogen of Leuβ195. Only three other direct hydrogen bonds are observed between ETF and MCAD: (i) between the side chain of Thr26 and the oxygen backbone of Alaβ193, (ii) the Glu34 and Tyrβ192 side chains, and (iii) the Glu22 and Thrβ77 side chains. The side chain of Leuβ195 is completely buried within a hydrophobic pocket lined by residues that are part of α-helices A, C, and D of MCAD. This pocket is formed by residues Phe23, Gly60, Thr64, Leu61, Leu73, Leu75, and Ile83. This hydrophobic patch extends across the interface to include the ETF residues Tyrβ192, Proβ197, Ileβ198, and Metβ199. A single putative ionic interaction at the periphery of this hydrophobic patch is made between ETF Argβ76 and MCAD Glu18, although the poor electron density indicates that both residues are predominantly disordered. In addition to the contacts made with the recognition loop, MCAD interacts with a second α-helix of ETF situated immediately adjacent to the α-helix of the recognition loop (Fig. 2A). This interaction also includes a weak ionic interaction between Lys21 and Gluβ73 in addition to the hydrogen bond between Glu22 and Thrβ77. However, these residues are not conserved, suggesting this interaction is specific to the ETF·MCAD complex. It is conceivable that several indirect hydrogen bonds can be made between both molecules via bridging water molecules that are not observed at this resolution. Comparison of the complex crystal structure with the available crystal structures for the uncomplexed protein partners (6Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14355-14360Google Scholar, 18Lee H.J. Wang M. Paschke R. Nandy A. Ghisla S. Kim J.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12412-12420Google Scholar) reveals no significant differences for the MCAD structures. The recognition loop of ETF has, however, adopted a slightly different backbone conformation with more extensive rearrangement of several side chains, including the pivotal Leuβ195, indicating an induced fit mode of binding for the ETF partner. Furthermore, the region comprising Ileβ14 to Serβ37 of ETF forms an extended loop and is slightly displaced with respect to the other ETF structures, thereby preventing close interaction with the C-terminal residues of MCAD. This results in the concomitant rearrangement of Tyrβ16 from its normal position near the FAD isoalloxazine ring. Leuβ195 Is Essential for Complex Formation—The ETF mutant Lβ195A leads to no significant rearrangement of the recognition loop, as determined by the 1.8 Å crystal structure of this mutant protein (data not shown); yet this mutant is severely impaired in complex formation with MCAD. Using MCAD as the electron donor to ETF, which in turn reduces the dye DCIP, the rate of DCIP reduction under steady state conditions decreases by ∼10-fold in the Lβ195A mutant ETF (Fig. 3A). This underpins the hypothesis that the recognition loop is the only region of ETF that interacts extensively with MCAD, with Leuβ195 a key interfacial residue. Furthermore, the rate of DCIP reduction using IVD, another member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family, is substantially decreased with the Lβ195A ETF as an electron acceptor of the enzyme (Fig. 3B). The rate of reduction of DCIP by IVD with the mutant ETF is reduced ∼2-fold with respect to the rate with wild-type ETF under the defined steady state conditions. It is anticipated that human ETF interacts with the seven acyl-CoA primary dehydrogenases in a fashion similar to that observed with MCAD itself. It is also interesting to note that experimental studies suggest Leuβ195, and thereby the recognition loop, are pivotal to correct docking with the structurally unrelated dimethylglycine dehydrogenase and its close relative sarcosine dehydrogenase. For example, evidence for competitive binding of ETF to acyl-CoA dehydrogenases and dimethylglycine dehydrogenase has been observed by microelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry and surface plasmon resonance, thus suggesting similar or closely overlapping binding sites on ETF for both types of dehydrogenase (19Hoard-Fruchey H.M. Goetzman E. Benson L. Naylor S. Vockley J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13786-13791Google Scholar). Although there is no direct evidence that ETF interacts with the membrane-bound ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase via the recognition loop, cross-linking experiments have suggested that the β-subunit preferentially interacts with ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (14Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 869-876Google Scholar). This suggests a mode of interaction similar to that observed for the human ETF·MCAD and bacterial ETF·TMADH complexes. That the sequence of the ETF recognition loop is highly conserved throughout ETFs from a diverse range of organisms indicates that ETFs are all likely to interact with their partners in a similar manner (Fig. 2D). MCAD and Related Dehydrogenases Present a Similar Docking Site—That ETF interacts with several different dehydrogenases via the recognition loop suggests that a similar complementary hydrophobic patch is formed on the surface of these proteins; this includes the small hydrophobic pocket that can accommodate the protruding Leuβ195 side chain. Alignment of the sequences of the seven MCAD-related human dehydrogenases with MCAD reveals that very few residues involved in the ETF·MCAD interface are conserved (Fig. 2C). With the exception of residue positions equivalent to Phe30, Gly60, and Gly74 in MCAD, which are likely conserved for folding reasons, none of the residues directly contacting the ETF recognition loop is totally conserved. Almost all positions involved in hydrophobic packing retain the hydrophobic nature of the side chain, whereas the positions involved in direct hydrogen bonds, Thr26 and Glu34, usually retain hydrogen bonding capacity. Docking of human IVD using the available human IVD crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1IVH) (20Tiffany K.A. Roberts D.L. Wang M. Paschke R. Mohsen A.W. Vockley J. Kim J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8455-8464Google Scholar) on the ETF·MCAD coordinates reveals that IVD presents a very similar surface to the ETF recognition loop. The side chain of Leuβ195 is buried by IVD hydrophobic residues at similar positions in the polypeptide chain (Fig. 2E). This hydrophobic pocket is clearly malleable to some extent, and the reduction in bulk at position 83 from Ile (MCAD) to Val (IVD) is compensated by a concomitant increase at position 64 involving Thr (MCAD) to Ile (IVD) and a size decrease at position 73 involving Leu (MCAD) to Ser (IVD) by rearrangement of the backbone. We have generated mutant forms of MCAD designed to reduce the size of the hydrophobic pocket. Mutants L61M, L73W, L75Y, and I83M are all severely impaired in electron transfer to wild-type ETF, as suggested by the decrease in DCIP reduction rates under the defined steady state conditions (Fig. 3A). Given that these residues are remote from the MCAD active site, this effect is most likely due to decreased binding strength of the ETF·MCAD complex. It is interesting to note that even in the case of mutants with “filled” hydrophobic cavities, the DCIP reduction kinetics are slower with the Lβ195A mutant than with wild-type ETF, despite the fact that the latter is expected to be less complementary with these MCAD mutants than the Lβ195A mutant. The inability to rescue (part of the) activity through complementary mutation on the ETF surface clearly suggests the need for a protruding element of ETF buried in the partner surface. This first of all increases surface contact area and avoids “slipping” of the otherwise flat hydrophobic contact areas but might also ultimately be involved in inducing the observed flexibility of the FAD domain in the complex. It is possible that upon binding to MCAD reorganization in the recognition loop signals, by an as yet unknown mechanism, to the FAD domain to sample the conformationally available space. Mammalian β-oxidation of fatty acids does not occur exclusively in the mitochondria. In liver and kidney ∼10% of the fatty acids are broken down by peroxisomal β-oxidation (21Kim J.J. Miura R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 483-493Google Scholar). The first step in the peroxisomal pathway is catalyzed by a distant relative of MCAD, acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), that passes electrons to oxygen generating hydrogen peroxide. Not surprisingly, the overall fold of ACO is similar to MCAD, but in comparison the MCAD regions involved in binding ETF are markedly different in ACO. Additionally, the C-terminal extension of 200 amino acids in ACO versus MCAD occupies a space similar to that occupied by the FAD domain in the ETF·MCAD complex. Modeling the FAD Domain in the Complex—The most striking observation is that upon complex formation the FAD domain of ETF changes from being well ordered to a highly disordered state. The electron density is reduced to background values at residues Lysα203 and Proβ231, which function as the hinge for this movement within the complex. The ETF FAD domain is a near perfect sphere, and perhaps not surprisingly, the “empty” volume at the MCAD-ETF interface corresponds almost exactly to that expected for the “missing” FAD domain. This is clearly indicative of a “ball-and-socket” type of motion, where MCAD and the ordered regions of ETF form the socket in which the FAD domain can apparently move freely within the conformationally allowed space. Similar molecular motions occur in the bacterial ETF·TMADH complex (8Leys D. Basran J. Talfournier F. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 219-225Google Scholar) and also within a single protein chain (e.g. the Escherichia coli 5′-nucleotidase (22Knoefel T. Strater N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 255-266Google Scholar)). A layer of water molecules and the presence of relatively few direct interprotein contacts likely facilitate these domain motions. A superposition of the free ETF crystal structure onto the ETF·MCAD crystal structure reveals minor clashes of several side chains for the FAD domain with the MCAD partner (Fig. 4A). With a shortest FAD-to-FAD isoalloxazine distance of 35 Å, this conformation is clearly incompatible with electron transfer, based on the 14 Å rule (23Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Google Scholar, 24Page C.C. Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 551-556Google Scholar). Surprisingly, it is not the FAD of the MCAD monomer to which the recognition loop is bound that is closest to the ETF FAD but that of the MCAD monomer related by 2-fold symmetry. An MCAD dimer should therefore be regarded as the partner of ETF; the N-terminal domain of one monomer binds the recognition loop, whereas the C-terminal FAD-binding domain of the other monomer hosts the moving FAD domain. Molecular dynamics calculations were used to systematically sample the position occupied by the FAD domain in the bacterial ETF·TMADH complex (8Leys D. Basran J. Talfournier F. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 219-225Google Scholar). These calculations suggest that the FAD domain occupies a large number of different positions, some of which show increased electronic coupling between the isoalloxazine ring of the ETF cofactor and the 4Fe-4S center of TMADH by reducing the distance to < 14 Å. Such motion of the ETF FAD domain within the ETF·MCAD complex would lead to similar reduction in interflavin distances (Fig. 4A), and several orientations of the FAD domain were found to reduce this distance to below 14 Å. In these cases, the C-7 or C-8 methyl groups of the ETF flavin are in close contact with Trp166, a conserved aromatic residue that π-stacks against the MCAD FAD isoalloxazine ring. Remarkably, modeled complexes that are electron transfer-competent all contain putative ionic interactions involving the conserved Argα249 in the FAD domain of ETF and either the negatively charged Glu212 or Glu359 on the MCAD surface (Fig. 4B). These solvent-exposed glutamate residues are positioned close to Trp166. Chemical modification experiments have indicated that a single arginine in ETF (25Parker A.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 254: 91-100Google Scholar) and carboxylates on the MCAD surface are essential for complex formation (26Frerman F.E. Mielke D. Huhta K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2199-2202Google Scholar). Dwyer et al. (27Dwyer T.M. Zhang L.N. Muller M. Marrugo F. Frerman F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1433: 139-152Google Scholar) reported that mutagenesis of Rα249K leads to a decrease in electron transfer rate of ∼10-fold under steady state conditions. Mutagenesis of MCAD at Glu212 (E212A) likewise leads to similar substantial reduction in DCIP reduction rates (∼10-fold under steady state conditions; Fig. 3B). Mutation of MCAD at the conserved Glu359 (E359A) does not significantly affect the DCIP reduction rate. Thus, it is likely that ionic interactions between Glu212 and Argα249 (but not Glu359 and Argα249) transiently stabilize productive conformations of the FAD domain leading to enhanced electron transfer rates between both partners. Solution data have indicated that electrostatic interactions are important in electron transfer from MCAD to ETF (28Beckmann J.D. Frerman F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 258: 7563-7569Google Scholar). Although electrostatic interactions are essentially absent from the MCAD·ETF domain III interface, the electron transfer rate decreases with increasing ionic strength. These observations can be a consequence of the destabilization of the protein-protein interaction between Argα249 and Glu212. Alternatively, the observations might result from enhanced hydrophobic interaction at high ionic strength involving the hydrophobic patch/ETF recognition loop. The concomitant decrease in the rate of complex dissociation following electron transfer might lead to the observed reduction in steady state turnover rate. The majority of the MCAD res"

Mutant E552A/E1197A bound MgATP and MgADP (1 mol/mol) with <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> 9.2 and 92 μm, showed strong temperature sensitivity of MgATP binding and equal dissociation rates for MgATP and MgADP. With MgATP as the added ligand, 80% of bound nucleotide was in the form of ATP. None of these parameters was vanadate-sensitive. The other mutants showed lower stoichiometry of MgATP and MgADP binding, in the order Ala > Gln > Asp > Lys. We conclude that the E552A/E1197A mutation arrests the enzyme in a conformation, likely a stabilized NBD dimer, which occludes nucleotide, shows preferential binding of ATP, does not progress to a normal vanadate-sensitive transition state, but hydrolyzes ATP and releases ADP slowly. Impairment of turnover is primarily due to inability to form the normal transition state rather than to slow ADP release. The Gln, Asp, and Lys mutants are less effective at stabilizing the occluded nucleotide, putative dimeric NBD, conformation. We envisage that in wild-type the occluded nucleotide conformation occurs transiently after MgATP binds to both NBDs with associated dimerization, and before progression to the transition state."
https://openalex.org/W2095475285,"The hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 4α gene possesses two promoters, proximal P1 and distal P2, whose use results in HNF4α1 and HNF4α7 transcripts, respectively. Both isoforms are expressed in the embryonic liver, whereas HNF4α1 is almost exclusively in the adult liver. A 516-bp fragment, encompassing a DNase I-hypersensitive site associated with P2 activity that is still retained in adult liver, contains functional HNF1 and HNF6 binding sites and confers full promoter activity in transient transfections. We demonstrate a critical role of the Onecut factors in P2 regulation using site-directed mutagenesis and embryos doubly deficient for HNF6 and OC-2 that show reduced hepatic HNF4α7 transcript levels. Transient transgenesis showed that a 4-kb promoter region is sufficient to drive expression of a reporter gene in the stomach, intestine, and pancreas, but not the liver, for which additional activating sequences may be required. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that throughout liver development HNF4α7 transcripts are lower than those of HNF4α1. HNF4α1 represses P2 activity in transfection assays and as deduced from an increase in P2-derived transcript levels in recombinant mice in which HNF4α1 has been deleted and replaced by HNF4α7. We conclude that although HNF6/OC-2 and perhaps HNF1 activate the P2 promoter in the embryo, increasing HNF4α1 expression throughout development causes a switch to essentially exclusive P1 promoter activity in the adult liver.

Zhong W.M. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). During mouse development, it is one of the first liver-enriched transcription factors (LETF) to be expressed, HNF4α transcripts being detected at E (embryonic day) 4.5 in primitive endoderm, in the visceral endoderm (E 5.5), and in the liver bud (E 8.5) (2Duncan S.A. Manova K. Chen W.S. Hoodless P. Weinstein D.C. Bachvarova R.F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7598-7602Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 3Taraviras S. Monaghan A.P. Schutz G. Kelsey G. Mech. Dev. 1994; 48: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The crucial role of this factor in the embryo was demonstrated by the inactivation of the HNF4α gene, causing perigastrulation lethality (4Chen W.S. Manova K. Weinstein D.C. Duncan S.A. Plump A.S. Prezioso V.R. Bachvarova R.F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2466-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) because of failure to activate visceral endoderm functions (5Duncan S.A. Nagy A. Chan W. Development. 1997; 124: 279-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When null embryos were transiently rescued by tetraploid complementation with wild-type morulae-derived visceral endoderm, HNF4α was dispensable for hepatic specification but not for activation of hepatic functions (6Li J. Ning G. Duncan S.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 464-474PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, liver-specific HNF4α deletion in the embryo (7Parviz F. Li J. Kaestner K.H. Duncan S.A. Genesis. 2002; 32: 130-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) led to disorganization of liver architecture (8Parviz F. Matullo C. Garrison W.D. Savatski L. Adamson J.W. Ning G. Kaestner K.H. Rossi J.M. Zaret K.S. Duncan S.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), and its forced expression in cultured hepatic cells resulted in the reexpression of some liver-specific genes (9Spath G.F. Weiss M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1913-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and restoration of epithelial morphology (10Bailly A. Spath G. Bender V. Weiss M.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2411-2421PubMed Google Scholar, 11Spath G.F. Weiss M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 935-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). HNF4α plays a pivotal role, regulating expression of genes involved in nutrient metabolism and transport (for review, see Ref. 12Sladek F.M. Seidel S.D. Burris T.P. McCabe E.R.B. Nuclear Receptors and Genetic Disease. Academic Press, London2001: 309-361Google Scholar), and its induced disruption in the adult liver provokes lethal defects in lipid and bile acid metabolism and ureagenesis (13Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 14Inoue Y. Hayhurst G.P. Inoue J. Mori M. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25257-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Hence, HNF4α is essential for both the induction and the maintenance of hepatic functions. The HNF4α nuclear receptor contains six domains (A-F) and possesses two activation functions (AF): AF1 corresponds to the 24 N-terminal amino acids (15Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kistanova E. Evagelopoulou C. Zeng S. Cladaras C. Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and AF2 is located in the E domain. Different isoforms of HNF4α arise by alternative splicing. The most important for the adult liver appear to be α1, the prototype protein (1Sladek F.M. Zhong W.M. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar), and α2, which possesses a 10-amino acid insertion in the C-terminal F domain (16Hata S. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 211-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar; for review, see Ref. 12Sladek F.M. Seidel S.D. Burris T.P. McCabe E.R.B. Nuclear Receptors and Genetic Disease. Academic Press, London2001: 309-361Google Scholar). The isoforms considered in this work result from alternative promoter usage. An N-terminal variant of HNF4α was cloned from the mouse (17Nakhei H. Lingott A. Lemm I. Ryffel G.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It arises from a distal upstream promoter, P2 (18Thomas H. Jaschkowitz K. Bulman M. Frayling T.M. Mitchell S.M. Roosen S. Lingott-Frieg A. Tack C.J. Ellard S. Ryffel G.U. Hattersley A.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2089-2097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), located about 40 kb upstream from the P1 promoter from which the α1 and α2 isoforms are transcribed (3Taraviras S. Monaghan A.P. Schutz G. Kelsey G. Mech. Dev. 1994; 48: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 19Zhong W. Mirkovitch J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7276-7284Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The HNF4α7 protein derived from P2 usage differs from α1 (and its splicing variants) only by the first exon, which in the case of α1 but not α7 contains a functional AF1. The differences in activation functions of these isoforms result from differences in cofactor recruitment (20Torres-Padilla M.E. Sladek F.M. Weiss M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44677-44687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the liver, the α7 isoform is expressed mainly in the embryo and is nearly extinguished in the adult. In accordance with this expression profile, the transactivation capacity of the HNF4α7 isoform is efficient for fetal functions such as α-fetoprotein, whereas that of α1 is higher than α7 for most hepatocyte promoters (21Torres-Padilla M.E. Fougere-Deschatrette C. Weiss M.C. Mech. Dev. 2001; 109: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The HNF4α7 isoform is also expressed in the adult stomach, intestine, and pancreas (17Nakhei H. Lingott A. Lemm I. Ryffel G.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In human, mutations in the HNF4α coding sequence that is common to P1 and P2-derived isoforms are associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (22Ryffel G.U. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 27: 11-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 23Yamagata K. Furuta H. Oda N. Kaisaki P.J. Menzel S. Cox N.J. Fajans S.S. Signorini S. Stoffel M. Bell G.I. Nature. 1996; 384: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Because predominantly P2 is active in the pancreas (17Nakhei H. Lingott A. Lemm I. Ryffel G.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 24Boj S.F. Parrizas M. Maestro M.A. Ferrer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), mutant HNF4α7 is probably incriminated in the insulin-secretion defects of diabetes, whereas the associated hepatic dysfunctions (26Lehto M. Bitzen P.O. Isomaa B. Wipemo C. Wessman Y. Forsblom C. Tuomi T. Taskinen M.R. Groop L. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 27Shih D.Q. Dansky H.M. Fleisher M. Assmann G. Fajans S.S. Stoffel M. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) can likely be ascribed to mutant α1 (for review, see Ref. 12Sladek F.M. Seidel S.D. Burris T.P. McCabe E.R.B. Nuclear Receptors and Genetic Disease. Academic Press, London2001: 309-361Google Scholar). Because the HNF4α7 and HNF4α1 isoforms show qualitative differences in their AF domains, it can be speculated that the regulation of expression of each is critical for ontogenesis of HNF4α-expressing tissues. In addition, because HNF4α7 transcripts are present in embryonic liver but are mainly extinguished in the adult where HNF4α1 transcripts are particularly high, it is possible that the products of one promoter influence activity of the other, providing another link in the transcription factor network regulating liver-specific gene expression. Although regulation of expression of the P1 promoter and its enhancer in liver cells has been analyzed (28Bailly A. Torres-Padilla M.E. Tinel A.P. Weiss M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3495-3505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hatzis P. Talianidis I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7320-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the factors driving expression of the P2 promoter in embryonic liver and its down-regulation in the adult remain to be determined. Here we demonstrate the existence of a single DNase I-hypersensitive site specifically associated with P2 activity. This site is present in embryonic liver and is retained in the adult even though HNF4α7 transcripts are barely detectable in adult liver, suggesting that chromatin at the promoter region remains in an open conformation after birth. Using a combination of embryonic liver-derived cultured cells and knock-out mice, we show that two Onecut factors, HNF6 and OC-2, are essential for HNF4α7 expression in the developing liver. HNF1α, and to a lesser extent HNF1β, also activate the P2 promoter. In addition, quantitative real time PCR revealed that, from E 12.5 and throughout liver development, P2-derived transcripts are always less abundant than those from P1. Finally, using knock-in mice expressing only one of the two N-terminal HNF4α isoforms under control of both promoters, we describe a dramatic repressive effect of HNF4α1 on the P2 promoter, providing a novel mechanism to explain HNF4α7 postnatal repression in the liver. Library Screening for Mouse Genomic Sequence Upstream from Exon 1D—Genomic clones were obtained by screening a mouse 129/Sv BAC library (Incyte, Inc.) for exon 1D sequences. One clone called m21 was used as a template for most experiments. This clone contained at least 12 kb upstream from the P2 promoter, the P1 promoter and its enhancer region, and exon 2. Cell Culture—MMH (Met Murine Hepatocyte) palmate and epithelial cells (MMH-pal and MMH-ep) are immortalized cell lines derived from mouse embryonic liver at E 14.5 representing, respectively, bipotential and committed hepatocytic liver cells (30Amicone L. Spagnoli F.M. Spath G. Giordano S. Tommasini C. Bernardini S. De Luca V. Della Rocca C. Weiss M.C. Comoglio P.M. Tripodi M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). They were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 50 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 30 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor II, and 10 μg/ml insulin on collagen I-coated (Sigma) dishes (Falcon Plastics, Inc.). FGC4 cells are differentiated rat hepatoma cells of adult phenotype (31Angrand P.O. Kallenbach S. Weiss M.C. Rousset J.P. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 519-526PubMed Google Scholar) which express mainly HNF4α1. However, these cells probably are not a faithful model for HNF4α7 down-regulation in the adult liver because they derive from H4II hepatoma cells, which express both isoforms. 2M.-E. Torres Padilla, C. Deschatrette, and M. C. Weiss, unpublished data. They were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (32Coon H.G. Weiss M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 62: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) containing 5% fetal calf serum. Mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts, 3TDM-1 trophoblastoma cells (33Nicolas J.F. Avner P. Gaillard J. Guenet J.L. Jakob H. Jacob F. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 4224-4231PubMed Google Scholar), and βTC1 insulinoma cells (34Efrat S. Linde S. Kofod H. Spector D. Delannoy M. Grant S. Hanahan D. Baekkeskov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9037-9041Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. βTC1 cells were kindly provided by P. K. Wellauer (ISREC, Epalinges, Switzerland). Cells were cultured at 37 °C under humidified 7% CO2. Analysis of DNase I-hypersensitive Sites—Nuclei were prepared from freshly excised organs of adult mice and liver from E 18.5 fetuses as described previously (35Pontoglio M. Faust D.M. Doyen A. Yaniv M. Weiss M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4948-4956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or from cultured cells scraped into phosphate-buffered saline on ice. Purified nuclei were resuspended in 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, treated for 10 min at 0 °C with 0-10 units of DNase I (Roche Applied Science)/μg of DNA. Nuclei were lysed, and DNA was purified and cleaved with the appropriate restriction enzyme prior to Southern blot analysis (36Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). Probes abutting the restriction cleavage sites (a 644-bp EcoRI-BamHI genomic fragment for EcoRI or BamHI and a 566-bp AlwNI-HindIII fragment for HindIII digestions) were [α-32P]dCTP labeled by random priming (Amersham Biosciences kit). RNA Isolation—Total RNA was isolated from cells or tissues either by lysis in guanidinium thiocyanate followed by centrifugation through a CsCl cushion (37Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar) or by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (38Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Poly(A)+ RNA was selected by use of PolyATtract® poly(dT) columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). RT-PCR and Quantitative Real-time PCR—Reverse transcription (RT) was performed using SuperScript II™ Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and random hexamers on 5 μg of DNase I-treated RNA following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Semiquantitative PCR (Bioline Taq) was performed with 1 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP and quantified when necessary with ImageQuant software. Forward primers for mouse HNF4α7 and HNF4α1 were 5′-catggtcagtgtgaacgcg-3′ and 5′-catggatatggccgactaca-3′, respectively, and a common reverse primer was used (21Torres-Padilla M.E. Fougere-Deschatrette C. Weiss M.C. Mech. Dev. 2001; 109: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Reverse and α7 forward primers matched rat cDNA perfectly, whereas the α1 forward primer contained two mismatches with the rat sequence, leading to poor amplification of HNF4α1 in FGC4 rat cells. The 5′-UTR P2 primer (5′-tgggtacccttggtcatgg-3′) was used with the same reverse primer for as many as 36 cycles because it was difficult to detect traces of α7 transcripts in the wild-type adult liver. Primers for 28 S rRNA (21Torres-Padilla M.E. Fougere-Deschatrette C. Weiss M.C. Mech. Dev. 2001; 109: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and HNF6 (39Lemaigre F.P. Durviaux S.M. Truong O. Lannoy V.J. Hsuan J.J. Rousseau G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9460-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) have been published, and OC-2 primers are as follows: 5′-gccacgccgctgggcaac-3′ and 5′-cagctgcccggacgtggc-3′. Real-time PCR was performed with SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) using HNF4α1 (5′-gaaaatgtgcaggtgttgacca-3′ and 5′-agctcgaggctccgtagtgttt-3′), HNF4α7 (5′-ggtacccttggtcatggtcagt-3′ and 5′-tggatgaattgaggttggcac-3′), or β-actin primers (5′-gcacagcttctttgcagctcct-3′ and 5′-gtacggcctcggcaacag-3′), on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences ABI PRISM® 7700 Sequence Detection system. To take into account the amplification efficiency of primers, we used the absolute standard curve method. Partial mouse HNF4α1 and HNF4α7 cDNA were amplified by PCR, cloned in pCR®2.1-TOPO® plasmid (Invitrogen) and sequenced. These plasmids were diluted in series to serve as standard dilutions on each 96-well plate. For β-actin, gel-purified PCR products were used as well. Data were analyzed by using Sequence Detector Systems software (Applied Biosystems). The numbers of target molecules in cDNA samples were estimated using the linear regression curve equation (R2 > 0.99) of the logarithm of the target molecules number plotted versus Ct values (threshold) in the corresponding standard. Reporter Constructs—The 516-bp and 4.1-kb luc constructs were obtained by subcloning of a -516/-13 bp and a -4096/-13 bp restriction fragment (relative to the ATG) into XhoI-HindIII (blunted) and NheI-HindIII (blunted) sites upstream from the pGL2-Basic (Promega) promoterless luciferase gene. Mutations in HNF1/6 sites were performed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All promoter constructs were verified by sequencing. The apoB-luc reporter has been described previously (40Maeda Y. Seidel S.D. Wei G. Liu X. Sladek F.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 402-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Transient Transfections—MMH, 3TDM-1, and NIH3T3 cells (1.7 × 105 cells/6-cm dish) were transfected using 3.3 μg of reporter construct and 1.7 μg of internal control RSV-lacZ (pMJM20) by the calcium phosphate procedure as described previously (41Faust D.M. Catherin A.M. Barbaux S. Belkadi L. Imaizumi-Scherrer T. Weiss M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3125-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) unless specified. For MMH cells, DNA precipitates were added in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor II, and insulin. Cells were harvested about 64 h later. FGC4 cells were transfected by electroporation and βTC1 cells by the calcium phosphate procedure or electroporation using 10 μg of reporter construct and 5 μg of internal control RSV-lacZ as described previously (28Bailly A. Torres-Padilla M.E. Tinel A.P. Weiss M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3495-3505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Luciferase activity was determined as described previously (46de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase activity by the standard colorimetric method. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity for transfection efficiency and calculated relative to that of pGL2-Basic unless specified otherwise. Values are the means of three to ten independent experiments (±S.D.). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Nuclear extract preparations and EMSA were performed as detailed previously (28Bailly A. Torres-Padilla M.E. Tinel A.P. Weiss M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3495-3505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences of the α7H1 and α7H6 oligonucleotides were 5′-gtgactggttactgtttaacgtatc-3′ and 5′-ccacccaccttgggtgattagaagaatcaataagataaccgggcg-3′. Bases in bold were replaced in α7H1mut with GT and GG (47Cereghini S. Blumenfeld M. Yaniv M. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 957-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and T and G in α7H6mut oligonucleotide. For competitions, a 50× molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides was used. The antibody raised against the HNF6 peptide GTAREPNPSVTG in rabbit (UC-6), the antibody raised against the OC-2 amino acids 36-311 in rat (UC-1), and the HNF3α antibody (Santa Cruz) were used at dilutions of 1/10 and 1/3. Transient Transgenesis—The 4.096-kb sequence upstream from the HNF4α7 ATG was subcloned in front of an nls-lacZ cassette (pSKT-nlslacZ plasmid, a kind gift from S. Tajbakhsh, Institut Pasteur, Paris) taking care to keep the entire α7 5′-UTR intact. The HindIII-NotI restriction fragment (∼7.4 kb) containing the construct was microinjected into zygote pronuclei (Centre d'Ingenierie Genetique Murine, Institut Pasteur). Embryos were harvested at E 17.5, fixed for 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde following a sagittal section, and X-gal stained at 30 °C overnight. Genotyping was performed by duplex PCR with lacZ-specific primers and primers specific for an endogenous gene (a kind gift from J. Barra, Institut Pasteur). Results are representative of three independently obtained transgenic embryos, all sharing identical staining profiles. Recombinant Mice—OC-2 knock-out mice were obtained by deleting the OC-2 first exon by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Double knock-out HNF6-/- OC-2-/- E 12.5 embryos were harvested at the expected proportions by crossing double heterozygous mice. 4P. Jacquemin, F. Clotman, G. G. Rousseau, and F. P. Lemaigre, unpublished data. HNF4α knock-in mice were obtained by replacement of the α1 first exon coding sequence (1A) by exon 1D coding sequence for “α7-only” mice and vice versa for “α1-only mice” using homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. In all cases, the entire 5′-UTR and Kozak consensus were conserved. Both types of homozygous mice are viable and fertile. 5N. Briançon and M. C. Weiss, manuscript in preparation. Terminology—Because up to nine isoforms of HNF4α have been described or proposed (for review, see Ref. 12Sladek F.M. Seidel S.D. Burris T.P. McCabe E.R.B. Nuclear Receptors and Genetic Disease. Academic Press, London2001: 309-361Google Scholar), each time that HNF4α7 is mentioned, this includes not only α7 but also the constitutively produced splicing-derived isoforms, α8 and α9. Likewise, HNF4α1 is meant to encompass at least the α2-α4 isoforms. A Single Hypersensitive Site Is Associated with P2 Activity and Retained in the Adult Liver—We began by defining the transcription initiation site of the murine HNF4α7 gene because the 5′-end of the cDNA published sequence (17Nakhei H. Lingott A. Lemm I. Ryffel G.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) did not match either the sequence of our BAC clone or that of a mouse chromosome 2 genomic contig. To verify in addition that the first exon of the HNF4α7 gene, exon 1D, is not preceded by an additional exon in hepatic cells, we performed both primer extension and RNase protection assays (see figures in the supplemental material; Refs. 83Szpirer C. Szpirer J. Differentiation. 1975; 4: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 84Triezenberg S.J. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. J. Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992: 48.1-48.5Google Scholar). The major start site was situated at -103 bp relative to the ATG. DNase I-hypersensitive site analysis was undertaken to identify genomic regions implicated in hepatic regulation of the HNF4α7 gene in the vicinity of exon 1D. The experiments were performed with fetal liver and cultured cells expressing α7 (Fig. 1A) and with tissues that have been described (17Nakhei H. Lingott A. Lemm I. Ryffel G.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 19Zhong W. Mirkovitch J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell.

Dev. 2001; 109: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) to express only traces of α7 (adult liver) or none at all (kidney, spleen). Using the E-B probe (Fig. 1B), which hybridized to an 8.7-kb EcoRI genomic fragment spanning exon 1D, we identified at least seven sites. However, only one was present exclusively in α7-expressing samples, including the βTC1 insulinoma cell line (Fig. 1A), and absent from kidney and spleen. This site was positioned ∼300 bp upstream from the ATG, within the promoter region. Strikingly, this site was also strongly digested in adult liver chromatin, suggesting that the reduction in HNF4α7 transcript amounts compared with fetal liver is not the consequence of a dramatic change in chromatin at the promoter. The signal corresponding to this site was less pronounced in fetal liver than in MMH-pal cells or adult liver, probably because of dilution by hematopoietic cells that do not express the HNF4α gene (48Watt A.J. Garrison W.D. Duncan S.A. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Positions of the hypersensitive sites were verified on HindIII-digested DNA, using the probe abutting the 3′-HindIII site (Fig. 1B), permitting analysis of the same genomic region but from the other direction. The specific site was observed again in fetal and adult liver (data not shown). We also searched for hypersensitive sites upstream from the 5′-EcoRI site using BamHI and the E-B probe, but only ubiquitous sites were found (data not shown and Fig. 1B). As a complement to this analysis, we performed a Blast search against the human genome (chromosome 20) of the sequence upstream from the murine HNF4α7 ATG to pinpoint conserved regions that could represent regulatory elements. In the 4.1-kb upstream region, two homology stretches were indeed found, at -520/+54 bp (containing exon 1D and the specific hypersensitive site shown previously) and a smaller stretch at -3523/-3388 bp relative to the ATG (Fig. 1C). The same alignment was performed against the rat genome, and the two conserved elements were found within longer homology stretches (not shown). 516 Base Pairs Confer P2 Promoter Activity in HNF4α-expressing Cells—To characterize cis-elements necessary for HNF4α7 hepatic expression, we prepared luciferase constructs containing the 4.1-kb and a smaller 516-bp proximal conserved fragment (Fig. 1C) for transfection analysis. We selected cell lines that expressed no HNF4α (NIH3T3), mainly HNF4α1 (FGC4 hepatoma cells (21Torres-Padilla M.E. Fougere-Deschatrette C."

Furthermore, this report identifies Jak2 as a potential therapeutic target in vascular diseases in which vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis contributes to pathological progression. Jak2 tyrosine kinase is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase known primarily as a mediator of cytokine signal transduction (1Neubauer H. Cumano A. Muller M. Wu H. Huffstadt U. Pfeffer K.

It is, though, potently activated in response to oxidative stress in the form of hydrogen peroxide (3Simon A.R. Rai U. Fanburg B.L. Cochran B.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1640-C1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the signaling cascade responsible for hydrogen peroxide-induced Jak2 activity was at least partially elucidated in vascular smooth muscle cells, no physiological role has been described for this pathway (4Frank G.D. Mifune M. Inagami T. Ohba M. Sasaki T. Higashiyama S. Dempsey P.J. Eguchi S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Madamanchi N.R. Li S. Patterson C. Runge M.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Runge and co-workers demonstrated that Jak2 activation by hydrogen peroxide induces the expression of heat-shock protein 70, a protein that can protect cells from oxidative stress. Based on these data, they suggested that Jak2 might help vascular smooth muscle cells adapt to oxidative stress (5Madamanchi N.R. Li S. Patterson C. Runge M.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress in vascular smooth muscle cells can cause proliferation, contraction, or apoptosis (6Rao G.N. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 593-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Sotnikova R. Gen. Pharmacol. 1998; 31: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Li P.F. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3602-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). How the same stimulus can result in such opposing endpoints is unknown but is probably dependent on the concentration of the oxidant. Furthermore, the signaling proteins that mediate these different responses are unknown. During vascular conditions such as atherosclerosis, circulating macrophages release large amounts of hydrogen peroxide on vascular smooth muscle cells. Apoptosis that occurs as a result of this release contributes to the progression of these pathologies (9Geng Y.J. Libby P. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 251-266PubMed Google Scholar, 10Isner J.M. Kearney M. Bortman S. Passeri J. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2703-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Identifying the mediators of oxidant-induced apoptosis may therefore uncover novel therapeutic targets. Interestingly, both pro- and anti-apoptotic roles have been ascribed to Jak2 tyrosine kinase activity in a variety of signaling systems (11Hattori R. Maulik N. Otani H. Zhu L. Cordis G. Engleman R.M.

Siddiqui M.A. Circulation. 2001; 104: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine what role, if any, Jak2 plays in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells. For this purpose we used primary isolated rat aortic smooth muscle (RASM) 1The abbreviations used are: RASM, rat aortic smooth muscle; DN, dominant negative; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; pAb, polyclonal antibody. cells. From these cells, two cell types were created. RASM-control cells were created by transfecting the RASM cells with a neomycin-resistant cassette. RASM-DN cells were created by stably transfecting RASM cells with a Jak2 dominant negative mutant to inhibit the function of endogenously expressed Jak2. The creation and characterization of these cells has been described previously (14Sayeski P.P. Ali M.S. Safavi A. Lyles M. Kim S.O. Frank S.J. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33131-33142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here, these cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide, and indicators of apoptosis were measured. We found that the suppression of Jak2 function by either the dominant negative protein or the Jak2 pharmacological inhibitor AG490 protected cells against apoptosis. Collectively, the data show that Jak2 is essential for hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells. Cell Culture—Creation and characterization of the RASM-control and RASM-DN cells has been described previously (14Sayeski P.P. Ali M.S. Safavi A. Lyles M. Kim S.O. Frank S.J. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33131-33142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum and growth-arrested in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 h prior to the experiments. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. AG9, AG490, and hydrogen peroxide were from Calbiochem. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma or Fisher Scientific. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed with two volumes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors (15Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 18.2.1-18.2.8Google Scholar). The samples were immunoprecipitated exactly as described (16Sayeski P.P. Ali M.S. Harp J.B. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitating anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) was from BD Transduction Laboratories. Western Blotting—Proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence exactly as described (16Sayeski P.P. Ali M.S. Harp J.B. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The anti-Jak2, anti-STAT1 (signal transducers and activators of transcription 1), anti-BCL2, and anti-Bax blotting antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-cleaved-caspase-9 antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology. Analysis of Genomic DNA Laddering—Genomic DNA was isolated using the Easy-DNA kit from Invitrogen. 20 μg of DNA was separated on a 1.8% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Laddering was analyzed under ultraviolet light using the GelDoc system from Bio-Rad. Hoechst 33342 Nuclear Staining—Cells were grown on microscope slides, serum-starved for 48 h, and treated with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide for 24 h. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 50 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain. Cells were then washed, fixed, and mounted as described previously (17Sandberg E.M. Ma X. VonDerLinden D. Godeny M.D. Sayeski P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1956-1967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The cells were visualized using a fluorescent microscope with the appropriate filter. Apoptotic cells were counted as those showing condensed and/or fragmented nuclei. A minimum of 100 cells from each of four replicates were counted for each of the six treatment conditions. Analysis of Mitochondrial Membrane Integrity—Mitochondrial membrane integrity was analyzed using the MitoCapture apoptosis detection kit from BioVision. Cells were treated with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide for 2 h and stained according to manufacturer's protocol. Live cells were then visualized using appropriate filters on a confocal microscope. The pixel intensity of photomicrographs of the cells was determined using morphometric software. To determine what role, if any, Jak2 plays in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, we used two cell types derived from primary RASM cells. RASM-control cells were created by transfecting primary RASM cells with a neomycin-resistant cassette, whereas RASM-DN cells were created by stably transfecting RASM cells with a Jak2 dominant negative mutant in order to inhibit the function of endogenously expressed Jak2. These cells have been characterized previously (14Sayeski P.P. Ali M.S. Safavi A. Lyles M. Kim S.O. Frank S.J. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33131-33142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine whether expression of the Jak2 dominant negative could inhibit Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to hydrogen peroxide, the two cell types were treated with 0.2, 0.5, or 1 mm hydrogen peroxide for 0, 5, or 10 min. Cellular lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and immunoblotted with an anti-Jak2 antibody to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated Jak2 (Fig. 1, top). The results demonstrate that, in RASM-control cells, hydrogen peroxide potently induces Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation and that tyrosine phosphorylation levels are highest following treatment with 0.5 or 1 mm hydrogen peroxide. In contrast, Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation is suppressed in RASM-DN cells. We believe, therefore, that these cells are a good model for delineating the role of Jak2 tyrosine kinase in response to exogenous hydrogen peroxide treatment. To demonstrate equal Jak2 expression among the samples, an aliquot of each sample was Western blotted with anti-Jak2 antibody (Fig. 1, bottom). We next used these cells to determine the role that Jak2 plays in hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis. For this purpose, the two cell types were treated with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide for 24 h. We assessed apoptosis by analyzing genomic DNA isolated from each cellular condition (Fig. 2A). Genomic DNA from RASM-DN cells treated with hydrogen peroxide showed no evidence of DNA fragmentation. In contrast, genomic DNA isolated from RASM-control cells that were treated with hydrogen peroxide was fragmented into ∼200 base pair bands, an occurrence that is characteristic of apoptosis. Furthermore, the Jak2 pharmacological inhibitor AG490 prevented genomic DNA fragmentation in RASM-control cells treated with hydrogen peroxide. The data in Fig. 2A demonstrate that Jak2 is essential for hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells. To demonstrate that RASM-DN cells could undergo apoptosis in response to another proapoptotic stimulus, genomic DNA was isolated from RASM-DN cells treated with 5 μm staurosporine, a potent activator of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway (Fig. 2B). The banding pattern characteristic of fragmented DNA was clearly seen in these cells, demonstrating that they are capable of undergoing apoptosis. Finally, to determine whether hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis of the RASM cells was dependent on the dose of hydrogen peroxide used, we treated RASM-DN and RASM-control cells with 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mm hydrogen peroxide for 24 h. Genomic DNA was then analyzed for fragmentation (Fig. 2C). As expected, the RASM-DN cells showed no evidence of DNA fragmentation. Treatment of RASM-control cells with a dose of 1mm hydrogen peroxide was essential for the induction of DNA fragmentation. We next quantified the amount of apoptosis occurring in RASM-control and RASM-DN cells treated with hydrogen peroxide. The cells were grown on microscope slides and treated with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide for either 0 or 24 h. The cells were then stained with the nucleus-specific Hoechst 33342 dye. Four replicate experiments were performed for each condition, and a minimum of 100 cells were counted from each replicate. Cells clearly showing condensed and/or fragmented nuclei were counted as apoptotic. Representative photographs of RASM-control and RASM-DN cells either left untreated, treated with hydrogen peroxide, or treated with hydrogen peroxide following pretreatment with the Jak2 inhibitor AG490 are shown (Fig. 3A). RASM-control cells treated with hydrogen peroxide had shrunken nuclei that fluoresced more intensely than those in untreated cells, which is indicative of apoptotic cells. In contrast, RASM-control cells treated with AG490 prior to hydrogen peroxide treatment appeared similar to untreated cells. Similarly, RASM-DN cells treated either with hydrogen peroxide alone or with both AG490 and hydrogen peroxide showed nuclear staining akin to that of untreated cells. Cells were counted, and the data are presented as the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 3B). These data demonstrate that untreated RASM-control and RASM-DN cells showed very low levels of apoptosis (2.4 ± 0.54% and 2.9 ± 0.85%, respectively). RASM-control cells treated with hydrogen peroxide showed 54.1 ± 3.71% of total cells undergoing apoptosis, whereas only 12.3 ± 1.93% of RASM-DN cells treated with hydrogen peroxide were apoptotic. Finally, 5.7 ± 0.81% of RASM-control cells and 4.4 ± 0.98% of RASM-DN cells that were pretreated with AG490 prior to hydrogen peroxide treatment were apoptotic. Collectively, the data in Figs. 2 and 3 demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 is essential for hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells, as either the expression of a Jak2 dominant negative protein or the pretreatment of cells with the Jak2 inhibitor AG490 reduces the percentage of cells undergoing hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis. We hypothesized that Jak2 was promoting apoptosis by regulating expression of a proapoptotic protein. Because Bax is a proapoptotic protein required for oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, we used Western blot analysis to determine whether Jak2 was required for hydrogen peroxide-mediated induction of Bax expression. For this purpose, RASM-control and RASM-DN cells were treated with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide for the indicated times. Cellular lysates were Western blotted with anti-Bax antibody (Fig. 4A, top). The data show that in RASM-control cells hydrogen peroxide induced a rapid and transient induction of Bax expression that peaked at 1–2 h. In contrast, hydrogen peroxide did not induce Bax expression in RASM-DN cells. To determine expression of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 protein, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with an anti-BCL2 antibody (Fig. 4A, middle). The data show that hydrogen peroxide caused a slight induction of BCL2 expression in both RASM-control and RASM-DN cells that was similar between the two cell types. The BCL2:Bax expression ratio is an important indicator of apoptosis; apoptotic cells often have a lower ratio than do non-apoptotic cells. Because hydrogen peroxide induced a similar BCL2 induction in both RASM-control and RASM-DN cells but preferentially induced strong Bax induction in RASM-control cells, the BCL2:Bax expression ratio is lower in RASM-control cells than in RASM-DN cells. This result is consistent with our finding that hydrogen peroxide preferentially induces apoptosis in RASM-control cells. To demonstrate equal protein loading among all samples, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with an anti-STAT1 antibody (Fig. 4A, bottom). Thus, these data demonstrate that Jak2 activation is required for up-regulation of the proapoptotic Bax protein and a subsequent alteration of the BCL2: Bax ratio in response to hydrogen peroxide. To demonstrate this result an alternative way, RASM-control cells were pretreated with either the Jak2 inhibitor AG490 or its inactive analog, AG9, and then treated with hydrogen peroxide for the indicated times. Cellular lysates were again Western blotted with anti-Bax antibody (Fig. 4B, top). The data demonstrate that AG490 attenuates hydrogen peroxide-mediated Bax induction in RASM-control cells when compared with the AG9-treated cells. The membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-STAT1 antibody to demonstrate equal loading among all samples (Fig. 4B, bottom). Collectively, the data in Fig. 4 demonstrate that Jak2 activation by hydrogen peroxide causes up-regulation of the proapoptotic Bax protein. During oxidative stress, the proapoptotic Bax protein is induced, localizes to the outer mitochondrial membrane, and increases mitochondrial membrane permeability (18Naderi J. Hung M. Pandey S. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Sarosi L.A. Rieber M.S. Rieber M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). This is an essential step in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, as it leads to activation of the downstream initiator caspase, caspase-9 (21Desagher S. Martinou J.-C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar). Because we demonstrated in Fig. 4 that Jak2 tyrosine kinase activity induces Bax expression, we hypothesized that activation of Jak2 by hydrogen peroxide may also contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent caspase-9 cleavage. To examine mitochondrial membrane integrity, we used the MitoCapture reagent to stain live cells treated with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide for 0 or 2 h and visualized the cells using confocal microscopy (Fig. 5A). In healthy, non-apoptotic cells, the dye accumulates predominantly in the mitochondria, where it forms aggregates and fluoresces red. In contrast, in apoptotic cells, the dye is unable to enter the mitochondria because of altered mitochondrial transmembrane potential and therefore remains predominantly in the cytosol as a monomer and fluoresces green. The data demonstrate that in untreated RASM-control and RASM-DN cells the MitoCapture dye fluoresces predominantly red, indicating that these cells are healthy. Following hydrogen peroxide treatment, the RASM-control cells show a decrease in red staining and a dramatic increase in green staining, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction in these cells. In contrast, the RASM-DN cells treated with hydrogen peroxide actually show increased red staining and only marginally increased green staining as compared with the RASM-control cells. To quantitate the results, the pixel intensity for both green and red staining of four photographs of each sample was determined. The ratio of green to red staining was calculated (Fig. 5B). The data show that the increase in green to red intensity ratio was greater in the RASM-control cells treated with hydrogen peroxide than in similarly treated RASM-DN cells. Collectively, these data indicate that hydrogen peroxide-induced Jak2 activation promotes mitochondrial dysfunction in vascular smooth muscle cells and that this result can be prevented by expression of a Jak2 dominant negative protein. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an essential step leading to cleavage of caspase-9. Caspase-9 is the primary initiator caspase of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway and is involved in hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis (22Katoh I. Tomimori Y. Ikawa Y. Kurata S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15515-15523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Yamakawa H. Ito Y. Naganawa T. Banno Y. Nakashima S. Yoshimura S. Sawada M. Nishimura Y. Nozawa Y. Sakai N. Neurol. Res. 2000; 22: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We therefore examined caspase-9 cleavage following hydrogen peroxide treatment in RASM-control and RASM-DN cells. For this purpose, the two cell types were treated with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide for the indicated times, and cellular lysates were Western blotted with anti-cleaved-caspase-9 antibody (Fig. 5C). The data demonstrate that in RASM-control cells hydrogen peroxide treatment caused the accumulation of cleaved caspase-9. In contrast, little caspase-9 cleavage occurred in RASM-DN cells. Furthermore, AG490 prevented cleavage of caspase-9 in RASM-control cells treated with hydrogen peroxide (data not shown). Jak2 tyrosine kinase activity is therefore required for cleavage and activation of caspase-9 in vascular smooth muscle cells during oxidative stress. Collectively, the data in Fig. 5 demonstrate that Jak2 activation by hydrogen peroxide is required for both mitochondrial membrane dysfunction and cleavage of the initiator caspase, caspase-9. Both of these events occur downstream of Bax induction in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Although Jak2 is traditionally considered a mediator of cytokine signaling, other ligands and stimuli can activate this signaling pathway (3Simon A.R. Rai U. Fanburg B.L. Cochran B.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1640-C1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Marrero M.B. Scheiffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E.

Oxidative stress is one such stimulus; Jak2 is potently activated by hydrogen peroxide in a number of cell types, yet no physiological end point has been attributed to hydrogen peroxide-induced Jak2 activity (3Simon A.R.

Additionally, hydrogen peroxide induces apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells, yet few intracellular mediators of hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis have been identified (25Li J. Li W. Liu W.

Circulation. 1999; 100: 967-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Here, we report that Jak2 activation by oxidative stress in the form of hydrogen peroxide mediates apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells. We demonstrated laddering of genomic DNA, a characteristic of apoptosis, in control rat aortic smooth muscle cells treated with hydrogen peroxide (RASM-control), but we also showed that laddering was non-existent in the same cells expressing a Jak2 dominant negative protein (RASM-DN) or in RASM-control cells treated with the Jak2 inhibitor AG490. We observed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis in response to hydrogen peroxide in the RASM-DN cells as compared with RASM-control cells. Moreover, pretreatment with AG490 reduced the percentage of cells undergoing hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis nearly to the level of untreated cells in both cell types, again suggesting a critical role for Jak2 in apoptosis. Finally, we provided evidence of the mechanism by which this occurs. In RASM-control cells, expression of the proapoptotic Bax protein was rapidly induced. There was no such Bax induction in the RASM-DN cells. Furthermore, in RASM-control cells, AG490 attenuated hydrogen peroxide-mediated Bax induction. This is the first evidence that Jak2 mediates Bax protein expression in response to hydrogen peroxide. Because Jak2 mediates changes in gene expression via activation of STAT proteins, we presume that Jak2 mediates Bax induction via activation of one or more STAT proteins. Moreover, we found that mitochondrial membrane integrity was compromised and that caspase-9 was cleaved in RASM-control cells but not in RASM-DN cells, indicating an essential role for Jak2 in these events. This report has therefore identified apoptosis as a physiological end point of Jak2 activation by hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, this work demonstrates that Jak2 is a novel mediator of hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells. These results could have profound consequences for the treatment of a number of vascular diseases in which oxidative stress-mediated cell death plays a prominent role. As such, this work identifies Jak2 as a potential therapeutic target in vascular diseases associated with oxidative stress.

The detailed molecular functions of cyclin A1 remain unclear, since the molecular networks involving cyclin A1-CDK2 have not been elucidated. Here, we identified novel cyclin A1/CDK2 interaction partners in a yeast triple-hybrid approach. Several novel proteins (INCA1, KARCA1, and PROCA1) as well as the known proteins GPS2 (G-protein pathway suppressor 2), Ku70, receptor for activated protein kinase C1/guanine nucleotide-binding protein β-2-like-1, and mRNA-binding motif protein 4 were identified as interaction partners. These proteins link the cyclin A1-CDK2 complex to diverse cellular processes such as DNA repair, signaling, and splicing. Interactions were confirmed by GST pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation. We cloned and characterized the most frequently isolated unknown gene, which we named INCA1 (inhibitor of CDK interacting with cyclin A1). The nuclear INCA1 protein is evolutionarily conserved and lacks homology to any known gene. This novel protein and two other interacting partners served as substrates for the cyclin A1-CDK2 kinase complex. Cyclin A1 and all interaction partners were highly expressed in testis with varying degrees of tissue specificity. The highest expression levels were observed at different time points during testis maturation, whereas expression levels in germ cell cancers and infertile testes decreased. Taken together, we identified testicular interaction partners of the cyclin A1-CDK2 complex and studied their expression pattern in normal organs, testis development, and testicular malignancies. Thereby, we establish a new basis for future functional analyses of cyclin A1.

Cyclin A2, also known as cyclin A, is a key regulator of the cell cycle in mammalian cells. It is ubiquitously expressed and essential for progression through the cell cycle. Cyclin A2 is involved in both S phase and G2/M transition through its association with distinct CDKs (15Pagano M. Pepperkok R. Verde F. Ansorge W. Draetta G.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1593-1602PubMed Google Scholar) and with CDK1 mainly at the G2/M transition (15Pagano M. Pepperkok R. Verde F. Ansorge W. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar).The second type of human cyclin A (22Yang R. Morosetti R. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 913-920PubMed Google Scholar), named cyclin A1 (in homology to findings earlier in mouse and Xenopus), associates with CDK2 in vitro and in vivo but not with CDK1, in contrast to the interaction of cyclin A1 with CDK1 in mice. The CDK2-cyclin A1 complex shows kinase activity on histone H1 (22Yang R. Morosetti R. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 913-920PubMed Google Scholar).Cyclin A1 expression is tissue-specific, and high levels of expression are restricted to testis in the healthy organism in humans (22Yang R. Morosetti R. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 913-920PubMed Google Scholar), to eggs and early embryos in Xenopus (23Howe J.A. Howell M. Hunt T. Newport J.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1164-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and to the germ line in mice (24Sweeney C. Murphy M. Kubelka M. Ravnik S.E. Hawkins C.F. Wolgemuth D.J. Carrington M. Development. 1996; 122: 53-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclin A1 is expressed shortly before or during the first meiotic division in spermatogenesis (25Ravnik S.E. Wolgemuth D.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and male cyclin A1 knockout mice are infertile (26Liu D. Matzuk M.M. Sung W.K. Guo Q. Wang P. Wolgemuth D.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Spermatogenesis is arrested prior to entry into metaphase I associated with inactive cyclin B-CDK1 complexes and therefore loss of M-phase factor activity (27Liu D. Liao C. Wolgemuth D.J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 388-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cyclin A1 expression is also diminished in patients suffering from infertility (28Schrader M. Müller-Tidow C. Ravnik S. Müller M. Schulze W. Diederichs S. Serve H. Miller K. Hum. Reprod. 2002; 17: 2338-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cyclin A1 expression increases at the entry into S phase of previously synchronized leukemic cells (22Yang R. Morosetti R. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 913-920PubMed Google Scholar). In G2/M phase, cyclin A1 expression and cyclin A1-CDK2 kinase activity reach their maximum levels, but cyclin A1 is detectable throughout the cell cycle in contrast to cyclin A2 (29Yang R. Müller C. Huynh V. Fung Y.K. Yee A.S. Koeffler H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2400-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It interacts with the cell cycle regulators E2F and pRb and neutralizes the cell cycle inhibition by pRb in SAOS-2 cells (29Yang R. Müller C. Huynh V. Fung Y.K. Yee A.S. Koeffler H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2400-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), which indicates a tissue-specific role in mitosis. However, the expression throughout the cell cycle rules out a major regulatory role for cyclin A1 in the mitotic cell cycle. The promoter of cyclin A1 is dependent on four Sp1 transactivation sites in a CpG island upstream of the transcriptional start site (30Müller C. Yang R. Beck-von-Peccoz L. Idos G. Verbeek W.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11220-11228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Cyclin A1 is supposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of myeloid leukemia, since it is highly expressed in leukemias of myeloid origin (31Yang R. Nakamaki T. Lübbert M. Said J. Sakashita A. Freyaldenhoven B.S. Spira S. Huynh V. Müller C. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 2067-2074PubMed Google Scholar). Upon induction of myeloid differentiation, cyclin A1 expression decreases (31Yang R. Nakamaki T. Lübbert M. Said J. Sakashita A. Freyaldenhoven B.S. Spira S. Huynh V. Müller C. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 2067-2074PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of murine cyclin A1 in transgenic mice leads to abnormal myelopoiesis in the first months after birth as well as to the development of myeloid leukemia at a low frequency. This indicates that cyclin A1 alone is not sufficient to induce transformation but contributes to leukemogenesis (32Liao C. Wang X.Y. Wei H.Q. Li S.Q. Merghoub T. Pandolfi P.P. Wolgemuth D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6853-6858Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).The molecular functions of cyclin A1 in pathological and physiological settings have not been investigated in detail. The distinct functions of cyclin A1 in mitosis, meiosis, and malignant diseases remain currently unknown. In addition, potential roles of cyclin A1 in other cellular processes have not been characterized. The major drawback of functional analyses of cyclin A1 on the molecular level results from the lack of knowledge about interaction partners and substrates of cyclin A1.The aim of this study was the identification of interaction partners of the cyclin A1-CDK2 complex in the testis. In a yeast triple-hybrid approach, we identified several potential interacting proteins of cyclin A1-CDK2 from a testis cDNA library. We confirmed the interaction with cyclin A1 by GST pull-down assays and analyzed the expression of the interaction partners in normal organs, in testis maturation, and in testicular malignancies. We have cloned a novel gene, INCA1 (inhibitor of CDK interacting with cyclin A1). INCA1 interacted with cyclin A1, was phosphorylated by the cyclin A1-CDK2 complex, and was tissue-specifically expressed in the testis. In summary, we characterized novel interaction partners of the cyclin A1-CDK2 complex that will guide the future functional analysis of cyclin A1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Triple-hybrid System—To identify cyclin A1-interacting proteins, a yeast triple-hybrid (Y3H) screen was performed using the Matchmaker™ Gal4 two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech). All experiments were carried out according to the recommendations of the supplier (Clontech, Yeast Protocols Handbook, Matchmaker™ two-hybrid system 3).In brief, a human testis cDNA library was cloned into the pACT2-AD vector (Clontech). Cyclin A1 served as bait for the library translation products. Cyclin A1 and CDK2 were both cloned into pBridge. The plasmids were co-transformed into the yeast strain AH109 (Clontech). The number of screened clones was calculated to be 1 × 107 clones. Transformed yeast cells were grown on high stringency selection plates (-Met, -Leu, -Trp, -His, -Ade, +5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (+X-gal)). The cDNA inserts in the positive yeast colonies were amplified by nested PCR. Sequences were analyzed by alignment to the NCBI data bases. For control purposes, we performed a conventional yeast two-hybrid screen in parallel with cyclin A1 as bait but without additional co-expression of human CDK2. This approach helped to exclude the identification of proteins binding to cyclin A1 only and not to the active cyclin A1-CDK2 complex. Only sequences identified in more than one yeast colony in the Y3H and not present in the yeast two-hybrid control screen are presented here and were used for further investigations.GST Fusion Proteins and GST Pull-down Assays—The interaction partners (INCA1 and GPS2 (G-protein pathway suppressor 2), full-length coding sequence; all others, longest clone isolated from the Y3H) were cloned in frame into the pGEX-5X-2 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) for expression of GST fusion proteins. GST fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-DE3, and purification was carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations (GST Gene Fusion System; Amersham Biosciences) using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). To control the preparations for equal concentrations and protein degradation, 10 μl of the slurry were run on an SDS-PAGE gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.For GST pull-down assays, 1 μg of GST protein on glutathione beads was washed once in 1× binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer in siliconized tubes. 4 μl of in vitro transcribed and translated cyclin A1, which was radioactively labeled with [35S]methionine with the TNT QuickCoupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega, Madison, WI) or lysates of baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells expressing cyclin A1 were added, and the reaction mix was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with binding buffer and SDS-PAGE, the gel was dried and analyzed by autoradiography or Western blotting for cyclin A1, respectively.In Vitro Kinase Reactions—For in vitro kinase assays, GST fusion proteins were incubated with cell lysates of baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were added to 15 μl of GST fusion beads (50% slurry, equal concentrations controlled by Coomassie staining) and 6 μg of insect cell lysate and incubated for 30 min in 1× kinase buffer (10 μm ATP, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF). After washing and SDS-PAGE, phosphorylation of INCA1 was detected by autoradiography. Site-directed mutagenesis of potential phosphorylation sites to alanine was carried out using the QuikChange™ strategy (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following standard protocols (for primer, see Supplementary Table I).Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR and Northern Blot—For expression analysis in normal organs, a commercially available cDNA library containing pooled human cDNA from various organs was used (Clontech). For expression analysis in malignant tissues, total RNA was isolated from fresh frozen tissue samples using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Twenty μg of total RNA were used for Northern blot hybridization (31Yang R. Nakamaki T. Lübbert M. Said J. Sakashita A. Freyaldenhoven B.S. Spira S. Huynh V. Müller C. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 2067-2074PubMed Google Scholar) and probed with the 32P-labeled cDNA of human INCA1.For RT-PCR, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using random primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA samples were diluted to 100 μl, and 2.5 μl of cDNA were used for each PCR. PCR amplification of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used to confirm the quality of cDNA and standardize the total amount of cDNA between different samples. The quantitation of mRNA expression levels was carried out using a real time fluorescence detection method based on TaqMan technology (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (33Müller C. Readhead C.

Med. 2002; 8: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). All primer and probe combinations (see Supplementary Table I) were designed to span an exon-exon junction to avoid amplification of genomic DNA. The probes were labeled at the 5′-end with the fluorescent dye 6-carboxy-fluorescein (cyclin A1 and INCA1)or 6-carboxy-rhodamine 6G (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and at the 3′-end with the quencher 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine. For the other interacting clones, specific primer pairs were designed, and the SYBRGreen detection method was used. At least two independent analyses were performed for each sample. The expression data regarding testis maturation were extracted from published primary microarray data (35Schultz N. Hamra F.K. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12201-12206Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar).Statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS 11.0 for Windows. For correlation analyses, the nonparametric Kendall Tau correlation analysis was used. To identify significant differences in gene expression, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test were performed. All p values indicate two-sided comparisons, and p < 0.05 was considered as significant.5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends for INCA1—Transcribed fragments of the genomic clone hRPC.1050_D_4 had been isolated from six colonies. The encoded gene was cloned by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Invitrogen). In addition, the murine homolog of INCA1 was identified by homology searches and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The GenBank™ accession numbers for INCA1, KARCA1, and PROCA1 are given in Supplementary Table II. For the analysis of the nucleotide and the amino acid sequence of INCA1, several World Wide Web-based resources were used. Detailed information about the software and prediction results are listed in Supplementary Table III.The discovered cDNA sequence was PCR-amplified from human testis cDNA and cloned into different vectors. The vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) was used as an expression vector in mammalian cells in transfection experiments. In addition, INCA1 was cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (Clontech) or fused to a Myc tag. Other vectors and constructs used are described in the corresponding sections under “Experimental Procedures.” Where applicable, cyclin A1 was expressed in pcDNA3.1(+) (33Müller C. Readhead C.

Luciferase assays for promoter activity were carried out essentially as described (30Müller C. Yang R. Beck-von-Peccoz L. Idos G. Verbeek W. Koeffler H.P. J. Biol.

Med. 2002; 8: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, COS-7 or S2 cells were transfected with the promoter constructs in pGL3 vectors and pRL-CMV for standardization purposes. The promoter activity was determined as the ratio of firefly luciferase luminescence divided by Renilla luciferase activity. All experiments were carried out independently three times, and data are indicated as mean with S.E.Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 (simian renal cells transformed by SV40) cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Biochrom) and 2 mm l-glutamine (Biochrom). ML-1 myeloid leukemia cells were cultured in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Sf9 insect cells were cultured at 27 °C in Schneider's insect cell medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom).Mammalian cells were transfected using SuperFect™ (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sf9 Drosophila cells were infected by baculovirus constructs (Baculovirus Expression Vector System; Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The cells were lysed on ice in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors.For localization analysis of INCA1, EGFP-INCA1 or EGFP alone were transfected into COS-7 cells, stained with 1 μg/ml DAPI for DNA and 2.5 μg/ml TRITC-phalloidin (both from Sigma) for actin, and analyzed by conventional fluorescence or confocal microscopy.Antibodies, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—Radioimmune precipitation lysates (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor) or the indicated protein solutions were run on SDS-PAGE gradient gels (Bio-Rad). Subsequently, proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), stained with specific primary antibodies and peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (AffiniPure F(ab′)2 fragment; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and detected with ECL plus (Amersham Biosciences).Primary antibodies against human INCA1 were raised in rabbits against two peptides, amino acids (aa) 26–40 (α-INCA1 1) and aa 156–170 (α-INCA1 2), and affinity-purified for the different peptides. Additional primary antibodies used for immunoprecipitation or Western blot detection were mouse-α-cyclin A1 (B88-2; PharMingen), mouse-α-c-Myc (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), α-actin (Sigma), and monoclonal α-EGFP (Clontech).For co-immunoprecipitation, 500 μl of lysate of transfected cells were rotated with 2 μg of α-Myc antibody at 4 °C for 1 h, and then 60 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added, and the reaction mix was rotated at 4 °C again for 2 h. After washing with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation, the bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted for EGFP-cyclin A1.For co-immunoprecipitation experiments with endogenous proteins, ML-1 cells, which highly express cyclin A1 (22Yang R. Morosetti R. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 913-920PubMed Google Scholar), were starved for 24 h at 0.1% fetal calf serum to induce expression of INCA1 and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. A total of 300 μg of protein were precleared with rabbit preimmune serum and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with either preimmune serum or anti-INCA1 serum. Agarose beads coupled to protein A/G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were used for precipitation. Beads were washed and subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. The Western blot was then detected with anti-cyclin A1 antibodies (Pharmingen). A nonspecific band at about 90 kDa was used to demonstrate equal loading of both samples.RESULTSIdentification of Cyclin A1/CDK2 Interaction Partners—The molecular function of cyclin A1 remains to be elucidated due to a lack of information about interactions on the molecular level. To identify cyclin A1 interaction partners, we screened a human testis cDNA library for interacting proteins. A Y3H with CDK2 co-expression was performed (Fig. 1A). The Y3H should mimic best the physiological conditions of the active kinase complex of cyclin A1 and CDK2. To minimize the probability of false positive clones, we only report sequences here that were found in at least two independent clones. We identified eight sequences for putative cyclin A1 interaction partners in more than one yeast clone: four known genes, two expressed sequence tags (ESTs), and two unknown cDNAs (Fig. 1B).Four Known Genes Interacted with the Cyclin A1-CDK2 Complex—The G-protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2; accession number U28963, identical to AMF1) was identified in four clones. GPS2 has been assigned to different functions in G-protein, Ras, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and p53 signaling and is part of the nuclear NCOR1-HDAC3 complex that inhibits c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation. We found in two clones the nuclear protein Ku70 (accession number NM_001469), which binds double-stranded DNA and plays an essential role in DNA repair. GNB2L1 (guanine nucleotide-binding protein β-2-like-1; accession number NM_006098), which is identical to RACK1 (receptor for activated protein kinase C1), is a homolog of the β-subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins. RBM4 (mRNA-binding motif protein 4; accession number NM_002896) is the human homolog to the Drosophila lark gene that is essential for embryonic development. Human RBM4 modulates alternative pre-mRNA splicing and antagonizes SR protein function. In two clones, sequences of the mRNA DKFZ p686G052 (accession number AL832200, abbreviated here as DKFZ) were enclosed. In a data base, this sequence was found in 157 ESTs (UniGene Hs.317304) from several tissues including acute myeloid leukemia. In 69 ESTs from normal organs, 13 sequences derived from testis. The mRNA encodes a hypothetical protein of 1686 aa of unknown function.Identification of Three Novel Proteins Interacting with Cyclin A1—In six clones, we found fragments of a novel mRNA that was not part of any human cDNA or EST sequence but was present in a genomic clone (accession number AC004771). Since this transcript was detected most often in our Y3H assay, we cloned and characterized it in more detail (see below; Figs. 7, 8, 9). The sequence was unknown before and did not contain any homologies or conserved motifs. Additional functional analyses revealed an inhibitory effect on CDK activity. 2S. Diederichs, N. Bäumer, S. Agrawal, W. E. Berdel, H. Serve, and C. Müller-Tidow, unpublished results. Therefore, we named it INCA1 (inhibitor of CDK interacting with cyclin A1).Fig. 7Interaction and phosphorylation of INCA1 by cyclin A1.A, GST pull-down assays of GST-INCA1 and cyclin A1 from either baculovirus-infected Sf9 cell lysate or in vitro transcription/translation confirmed binding of INCA1 and cyclin A1 in vitro. B, COS-7 cells were transfected with EGFP-cyclin A1 and Myc-INCA1. Immunoprecipitation with α-Myc antibody and subsequent Western blotting for EGFP-cyclin A1 indicated interaction of cyclin A1 and INCA1 in vivo. ML-1 leukemia cells that express high levels of cyclin A1 were serum-starved to induce INCA1 expression. Immunoprecipitation was performed on equal amounts of protein lysate with α-INCA1 immune serum or with preimmune serum for control purposes. Western blotting for cyclin A1 revealed interaction of endogenous cyclin A1 with endogenous INCA1 in starved ML-1 cells. The higher nonspecific band (*) is shown as a loading control.

https://openalex.org/W2078182188,"It has been proposed that a constitutive, physical association of the Met receptor and the α6β4 integrin exists on the surface of invasive carcinoma cells and that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-mediated invasion is dependent on α6β4 (Trusolino, L., Bertotti, A., and Comoglio, P. M. (2001) Cell 107, 643–654). The potential significance of these results prompted us to re-examine this hypothesis. Using three different carcinoma cell lines that express both Met and α6β4, we were unable to detect the constitutive association of these receptors by co-immunoprecipitation. Moreover, carcinoma cells that lacked expression of α6β4 exhibited Met-dependent invasion toward HGF, and increasing Met expression by viral infection of these cells enhanced invasion without inducing α6β4 expression. Although expression of α6β4 in such cells enhanced their invasion to HGF, it also enhanced their ability to invade toward other chemoattractants such as lysophosphatidic acid, and this latter invasion was not inhibited by a function-blocking Met antibody. Finally, depletion of β4 by RNA interference in invasive carcinoma cells that express both receptors reduced the ability of these cells to invade toward HGF by ∼25%, but it did not abrogate their invasion. These data argue that the invasive function of Met can be independent of α6β4 and that α6β4 has a generic influence on the invasion of carcinoma cells that is not specific to Met. It has been proposed that a constitutive, physical association of the Met receptor and the α6β4 integrin exists on the surface of invasive carcinoma cells and that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-mediated invasion is dependent on α6β4 (Trusolino, L., Bertotti, A., and Comoglio, P.

Finally, depletion of β4 by RNA interference in invasive carcinoma cells that express both receptors reduced the ability of these cells to invade toward HGF by ∼25%, but it did not abrogate their invasion. These data argue that the invasive function of Met can be independent of α6β4 and that α6β4 has a generic influence on the invasion of carcinoma cells that is not specific to Met. Understanding the receptor-mediated mechanisms that underlie invasive carcinoma is a timely and significant endeavor. The involvement of specific integrins and growth factor receptors in the invasive process is established, and several lines of evidence indicate that these two classes of surface receptors may cooperate to effect a wide range of biological functions, including the migration and invasion of tumor cells (2Beviglia L. Kramer R.H. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 640-649Google Scholar, 3Stupack D.G. Cheresh D.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 9022-9029Google Scholar, 4Santoro M.M. Gaudino G. Marchisio P.C. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 257-271Google Scholar). The available data indicate that integrin and growth factor signaling can be synergistic, and in some cases physical association may occur between these receptor types. Insight into the nature of such receptor interactions has important implications not only for understanding the biology of tumor invasion but also for the design and use of therapeutics targeted to these receptors (5Tantivejkul K. Vucenik I. Shamsuddin A.M. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 3681-3689Google Scholar). An integrin of particular relevance to invasive carcinoma is α6β4 (6Mercurio A.M. Rabinovitz I. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 129-141Google Scholar, 7Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Google Scholar, 8Rabinovitz I. Mercurio A.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 811-821Google Scholar). This integrin, which is expressed primarily on the basal surface of most epithelia and in most carcinoma cells, is defined as an adhesion receptor for most of the known basement membrane laminins (6Mercurio A.M. Rabinovitz I. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 129-141Google Scholar, 9Mercurio A.M. Bachelder R.E. Chung J. O'Connor K.L. Rabinovitz I. Shaw L.M. Tani T. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2001; 6: 299-309Google Scholar). A primary function of α6β4, revealed by studies of knock-out mice, is to maintain the integrity of epithelia (10Dowling J. Yu Q.C. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 559-572Google Scholar, 11Vanderneut R. Krimpenfort P. Calafat J. Niessen C.M. Sonnenberg A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 366-369Google Scholar). This critical role for α6β4 derives from its ability to mediate the formation of stable adhesive structures, termed hemidesmosomes, on the basal cell surface that link the cytokeratin network with laminins in the basement membrane (12Borradori L. Sonnenberg A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 411-418Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed novel and important functions for this integrin in the migration and invasion of carcinoma cells (13Mercurio A.M. Rabinovitz I. Shaw L.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 541-545Google Scholar). The expression of α6β4 is maintained or often increased in invasive and metastatic carcinomas, and its expression level correlates with the progression of these carcinomas (14Mercurio A.M. Bachelder R.E. Rabinovitz I. O'Connor K.L. Tani T. Shaw L.M. Surg. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 2001; 10 (Review viii–ix): 313-328Google Scholar). More recently, compelling data were reported that suggest the α6β4 integrin is essential for squamous carcinogenesis (15Dajee M. Lazarov M. Zhang J.Y. Cai T. Green C.L. Russell A.J. Marinkovich M.P. Tao S. Lin Q. Kubo Y. Khavari P.A. Nature. 2003; 421: 639-643Google Scholar). Given the potential importance of the α6β4 integrin to invasive carcinoma, extensive efforts are being made to define the mechanisms by which it facilitates the invasive process. Advances include the observation that α6β4 is localized to the leading edge of migrating carcinoma cells where it can contribute to the formation and stabilization of actin protrusions (16Rabinovitz I. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1873-1884Google Scholar, 17Rabinovitz I. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1147-1160Google Scholar). In addition, there is evidence from several laboratories indicating that α6β4 stimulates the activity of phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K) 1The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; SCR, scrambled. in invasive carcinoma cells and that PI3K is essential for migration and invasion (7Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Google Scholar, 18Gambaletta D. Marchetti A. Benedetti L. Mercurio A.M. Sacchi A. Falcioni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10604-10610Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been suggested that α6β4 activates PI3K and mediates invasion through its ability to cooperate with specific growth factor receptors (1Trusolino L. Bertotti A. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 643-654Google Scholar, 4Santoro M.M. Gaudino G. Marchisio P.C. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 257-271Google Scholar, 18Gambaletta D. Marchetti A. Benedetti L. Mercurio A.M. Sacchi A. Falcioni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10604-10610Google Scholar). For example, α6β4 has been shown to associate with erbB2 on the surface of breast carcinoma cells, and this interaction appears to facilitate activation of PI3K and invasion (18Gambaletta D. Marchetti A. Benedetti L. Mercurio A.M. Sacchi A. Falcioni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10604-10610Google Scholar, 19Falcioni R. Antonini A. Nistico P. Di Stefano S. Crescenzi M. Natali P.G. Sacchi A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 76-85Google Scholar). More recently, it was argued that α6β4 functions as an essential adaptor protein for the Met receptor in invasive carcinoma cells (1Trusolino L. Bertotti A. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 643-654Google Scholar). The impact of this finding is amplified by the fact that substantial evidence exists for the importance of Met in the scattering, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cells (20Comoglio P.M. Boccaccio C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 153-165Google Scholar, 21Comoglio P.M. Trusolino L. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 857-862Google Scholar). If α6β4 were an essential, specific adaptor for Met function in these events, the consequences for carcinoma biology and therapy would be profound. The potential significance of these results prompted us to re-examine the central findings of this study, which were that a selective physical association between Met and α6β4 exists on the surface of invasive carcinoma cells and that Met cannot promote invasion in the absence of α6β4 expression. Cells—MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells were obtained from the Lombardi Breast Cancer Depository at Georgetown University (Washington, DC), and A431 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Cells were grown in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 25 mm Hepes. The generation of stable transfectants of MDA-MB-435 cells that express the α6β4 integrin has been described previously (7Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Google Scholar). For Met expression studies, a vesicular stomatitis virus-coated retrovirus containing Met cDNA was obtained from Dr. Morag Park (McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). SUM-159 cells were obtained from Dr. Stephen Ethier at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center (Ann Arbor, MI) and maintained in Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, 1 mg/ml hydrocortisol, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 25 mm Hepes (22Flanagan L. Van Weelden K. Ammerman C. Ethier S.P. Welsh J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1999; 58: 193-204Google Scholar). To create β4 siRNA-pSUPER and β4 SCR-pSUPER expression vectors, the following oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) were annealed and ligated into pSUPER (a gift from R. Agami, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) between the BglII and HindIII sites: β4 siRNA, 5′-gatccccGAGCTGCACGGAGTGTGTCttcaagagaGACACACTCCGTGCAGCTCtttttggaaa-3′ and 5′-agcttttccaaaaaGAGCTGCACGGAGTGTGTCtctcttgaaGACACACTCCGTGCAGCTCggg-3′; β4 SCR, 5′-gatccccGTTGTCGAGGAACGGTGCCttcaagagaGGCACCGTTCCTCGACAACtttttggaaa-3′ and 5′-agcttttccaaaaaGTTGTCGAGGAACGGTGCCtctcttgaaGGCACCGTTCCTCGACAACggg-3′. EcoRI- and XhoI-digested inserts containing the H1-RNA promoter and either β4 siRNA or β4 SCR targeting oligonucleotides from pSUPER were then subcloned into pSUPER.retro (Oligoengine, Seattle, WA) to generate β4 siRNA and β4 SCR-pSUPER.retro. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm that they were correct. To generate retroviruses, β4 siRNA or β4 SCR-pSUPER.retro and expression plasmids containing envelope and packaging proteins required for viral propagation (Imgenex, San Diego, CA) were transfected into 293T cells (3 × 106 cells/100-mm plate) with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Three days after transfection, viral supernatants were harvested, and SUM-159 recipient cells were infected in the presence of a serum-containing medium supplemented with 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma). Following infection for 24 h, resistant cells were selected with 4.0 μg/ml puromycin (Clontech), and cell lines that stably expressed β4 siRNA or β4 SCR were generated. The stable β4 siRNA SUM-159 cell line was then sorted by flow cytometry, and the population of cells that expressed the lowest level of β4 was isolated. The sorting and subsequent surface labeling analysis of the β4-deficient cell line was performed with 3E1, a mouse anti-β4 integrin antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). The decreased level of β4 expression in this cell line was further confirmed by Western blotting with a rabbit polyclonal anti-β4 integrin antibody (505) (17Rabinovitz I. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1147-1160Google Scholar). Biochemical Analyses—For the co-immunoprecipitation studies, cells were extracted for 15 min at 4 °C with a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1% Nonidet P-40 in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, sodium fluoride, and sodium orthovanadate). Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatants were collected, and their protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Immunoprecipitations were performed with equal amounts of total protein. Extracts were preabsorbed overnight using protein A- and G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) to prevent nonspecific binding. After centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min to pellet these beads, the supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg of the following antibodies: rat β4 mAb, 439-9B (obtained from Rita Falcioni, Regina Elena Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy), polyclonal anti-human Met C-12 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse β4 mAb, 3E1 (Chemicon), mouse Met mAb DO-24 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), and the appropriate rat, rabbit, and mouse IgGs (Sigma). Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A- and G-Sepharose, washed four times with extraction buffer, and eluted in 1× reducing sample buffer. For immunoblotting, cell extracts were prepared as described previously. These extracts or the immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-C nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Bioscience). Membranes were blocked for 1 h using 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T), and 5% Carnation dry milk. The membranes were incubated overnight in the same buffer containing antibodies specific for either the β4 integrin (505), anti-β-actin (Sigma), or Met (C-12, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, or (DO-21, Upstate Biotechnology). After three 10-min washes in TBS-T, the membranes were incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer containing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. After three 10-min washes in TBS-T, proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). For immunoblots involving the phosphotyrosine Ab (anti-phosphotyrosine, clone PY99, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), the membranes were blocked for 1 h using 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 2% bovine serum albumin (w/v). The membranes were washed briefly and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the same blocking buffer containing the phosphotyrosine Ab. After washing, the filters were incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer containing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab, and the proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Invasion Assays—To prepare the Transwell membranes (Corning Glass) for the invasion assays, 0.5 μg of Matrigel (Collaborative Research, Waltham, MA) was diluted with cold water and left to dry overnight onto the upper side of the membranes at 25 °C. On the following day, the lower sides of the membranes were coated with 10 μg/ml laminin-1 (Calbiochem) and again left to dry overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were blocked with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (or Ham's F-12 medium for SUM-159) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were trypsinized on the following day and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.25% heat-inactivated lipid-free bovine serum albumin, and a total of 5 × 104 cells was added to the upper chamber of each well. Chemoattractants (50 ng/ml HGF (R & D System, Minneapolis, MN), 100 ng/ml lysophosphatidic acid (Sigma), or 3T3 cell-conditioned medium) were added to the bottom wells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-bovine serum albumin. In some assays, cells were preincubated with a function-blocking Met mAb, clone 95309 (R & D Systems), for 1 h at 4 °C before plating. After incubating for 2 or 4 h at 37 °C, non-migrating cells were mechanically removed from the upper chamber with a cotton swab. Cells that had migrated to the lower side of the Transwell membrane were fixed with 100% methanol and stained with 0.2% crystal violet in 2% ethanol. Invasion was quantified by counting the number of cells per square millimeter using a reticule with bright-field optics. Lack of Evidence for Constitutive Association between Met and α6β4 Integrin in Invasive Carcinoma Cells—Evidence to support a physical association between Met and the α6β4 integrin has been shown in co-immunoprecipitation experiments using COS cells transfected to express high levels of both Met and α6β4, as well as in carcinoma cells that express both receptors endogenously (1Trusolino L. Bertotti A. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 643-654Google Scholar). In particular, it was reported that β4 immunoprecipitates of A431 cells contain significant amounts of Met. To confirm these findings, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays using A431 cells, as well as MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells, which express high levels of both α6β4 and Met. In addition, MDA-MB-435 cells that stably express the α6β4 integrin were examined because they had been used previously to demonstrate the necessity of α6β4 for HGF-dependent invasion (1Trusolino L. Bertotti A. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 643-654Google Scholar). To assess a putative physical association of these two receptors, cells were extracted with the same Nonidet P-40 (1%) buffer used previously (1Trusolino L. Bertotti A. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 643-654Google Scholar), and extracts were “precleared” and then immunoprecipitated with Abs specific for either the β4 integrin subunit (439-9B) or Met (C-12). Subsequently, the precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with either β4-specific polyclonal (505) Ab or Met Ab (C-12). As shown in Fig. 1A, the β4 integrin subunit was evident in the β4 immunoprecipitates, and Met was evident in the Met immunoprecipitates. However, there was no indication of Met in the β4 immunoprecipitates or of β4 in the Met immunoprecipitates. To exclude the possibility that the co-immunoprecipitation of these two receptors is dependent on the detergent used for extraction, we also used Triton X-100-based buffer (1%) but failed to detect evidence for their physical association (data not shown). In addition, other Abs were used for the co-immunoprecipitation studies in A431 cells. Two different Met Abs (C-12 and DO-24) immunoprecipitated Met effectively but not the β4 integrin subunit (Fig. 1B). Similarly, β4 integrin subunit Abs (439-9B and 3E1) immunoprecipitated the β4 integrin subunit but not Met (Fig. 1B). Met Can Function Independently of the α6β4 Integrin in MDA-MB-435 Cells—To evaluate the hypothesis that the invasive function of Met is dependent on the α6β4 integrin, we used MDA-MB-435 cells that express Met but not α6β4 (Fig. 2). In addition, the level of Met expression was increased in these cells by retroviral infection with a Met cDNA. This infection increased Met expression by ∼2-fold (Fig. 2A), but it did not induce expression of α6β4 (Fig. 2B). The ability of Met to signal in the absence of α6β4 expression was examined. In the control cells, HGF stimulation induced a rapid and marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Met as assessed by immunoprecipitating Met followed by immunblotting these immunoprecipitates with a phosphotyrosine-specific Ab (Fig. 2C). The intensity of this phosphotyrosine signal was increased in the Met infectants, in agreement with the fact that these cells express significantly more Met than do the control infectants (Fig. 2A). Subsequently, we assessed the ability of the control and Met infectants to invade toward HGF. Invasion assays were performed for 4 h without prior serum deprivation. As shown in Fig. 2D, HGF induced the invasion of the control cells significantly, and this invasion was abrogated by a function-blocking Met-specific antibody. A 2-fold induction of HGF-dependent invasion was observed in the Met infectants compared with control cells, substantiating the conclusion that Met promotes invasion in the absence of α6β4 integrin (Fig. 2D). α6β4 Integrin Has a Generic Influence on Carcinoma Invasion That Is Not Specific to Met—A key finding in the previous study, which concluded that α6β4 is necessary for the invasive function of Met, was that expression of α6β4 in MDA-MB-435 cells induces their ability to invade toward HGF (1Trusolino L. Bertotti A. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 643-654Google Scholar). Although our results confirm the observation that expression of the α6β4 integrin increases the invasion of these cells toward HGF, we observed that the mock transfectants, which lack α6β4, exhibited significant migration toward HGF (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the level of invasion induced by expression of α6β4 is comparable with the increased invasion that results from increased Met expression and that this latter mode of invasion occurs in the absence of α6β4 (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, expression of α6β4 in MDA-MB-435 cells also enhanced the ability of the MDA-MB-435 cells to invade toward other chemoattractants such as lysophosphatidic acid, and this invasion was not inhibited by a function-blocking Met antibody (Fig. 3B). This latter result indicated that the expression of α6β4 can enhance the ability of MDA-MB-435 cells to invade independently of Met expression. Invasion assays were performed for 4 h in serum-free medium, and, under these conditions, no significant increase in apoptosis was observed for any cell population as assessed by annexin-V fluorescein isothiocyanate staining (data not shown). To assess the putative functional dependence of Met on the α6β4 integrin from a different perspective, we used SUM-159 cells (22Flanagan L. Van Weelden K. Ammerman C. Ethier S.P. Welsh J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1999; 58: 193-204Google Scholar). These invasive breast carcinoma cells express both α6β4 and Met (Fig. 4A). Using this cell line, we generated a SUM-159 cell line deficient in β4 integrin expression using siRNA strategies (23Lipscomb E.A. Dugan A.S. Rabinovitz I. Mercurio A.M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2003; 20: 569-576Google Scholar). Stable infectants that exhibited a reduction in β4 expression were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorter using a β4-specific antibody, and a population of cells was isolated that exhibited no detectable β4 expression as evident by immunoblotting (Fig. 4A). Notably, the loss of β4 expression had no effect on Met expression in these cells (Fig. 4A). SUM-159 cells exhibited a robust invasion toward HGF (Fig. 4B). Loss of α6β4 expression reduced the ability of these cells to invade toward HGF by ∼25%, but it did not abrogate their invasion (Fig. 4B). Moreover, loss of α6β4 expression also diminished the invasion of SUM-159 cells toward 3T3 cell-conditioned medium by ∼30%. The report that the invasive function of the Met receptor is dependent on a physical association with the α6β4 integrin, which provides a “signaling adaptor function,” afforded a compelling model for invasive carcinoma that linked these two receptors (1Trusolino L. Bertotti A. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 643-654Google Scholar). The data obtained in our study unfortunately do not support the central tenets of this model. Rather, our data argue that the invasive function of Met can be independent of α6β4 and that α6β4 has a generic influence on the invasion of carcinoma cells that is not specific for HGF-dependent invasion. The demonstration of a physical association between an integrin and a growth factor receptor provides prima facie evidence for cooperativeness of function. For this reason, the previous finding that Met and α6β4 could be co-immunoprecipitated from GTL-16 cells, which overexpress a constitutively active form of Met, from COS cells engineered to express both receptors at high levels and from A431 cells, which also express both receptors, strengthened the possibility of a functional dependence (1Trusolino L. Bertotti A. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 643-654Google Scholar). Despite using three different carcinoma cell lines that express both Met and α6β4 (A431, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-435, engineered to express α6β4), however, we were unable to detect any evidence for the constitutive association of these receptors by co-immunoprecipitation. The reason for the difference between our results and those of Trusolino et. al. (1Trusolino L. Bertotti A. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 643-654Google Scholar) is unclear. It is worth noting, however, that in the previous study co-immunoprecipitation data were not provided for either MDA-MB-231 cells or MDA-MB-435/β4 cells, and an association between Met and α6β4 in A431 cells was detected only by immunoprecipitation with a β4 integrin antibody and immunoblotting with a Met Ab and not vice versa. In addition, the use of another purified β4 integrin Ab (439-9B) failed to coimmunoprecipitate Met. Although our data refute the existence of a constitutive association of Met with α6β4 in carcinoma cells, they do not exclude the occurrence of a transient association between these two receptors in certain physiological situations or the possibility that a spurious association may occur on their gross overexpression. The lack of evidence for a physical association between α6β4 and Met does not negate the possibility that they exhibit functional cooperativeness. To evaluate the hypothesis that the invasive function of Met depends on α6β4, we assessed the invasion of MDA-MB-435 cells, which express Met but not α6β4. These cells exhibited significant invasion toward HGF, and their rate of invasion increased in response to increasing Met expression by retroviral infection. The fact that these cells are capable of significant HGF-dependent invasion in the absence of α6β4 expression argues against the necessity of this integrin for Met function. Moreover, a key finding in the previous study was that expression of α6β4 in MDA-MB-435 cells induced their ability to invade toward HGF but not toward EGF. We note, however, EGF is not a suitable negative control because MDA-MB-435 cells lack expression of the EGF receptor (24Ke S. Wen X. Gurfinkel M. Charnsangavej C. Wallace S. Sevick-Muraca E.M. Li C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7870-7875Google Scholar). 2R. Bachelder, personal communication. Additional support for the hypothesis that the invasive function of Met can occur independently of α6β4 is provided by our data on SUM-159 breast carcinoma cells. These invasive cells express both Met and α6β4, and they exhibit a robust invasion toward HGF. Our finding that elimination of α6β4 expression using a β4-specific siRNA reduced but did not abrogate invasion toward HGF, however, argues against the conclusion that α6β4 is an essential adaptor for Met in promoting carcinoma invasion. The strength of the SUM-159 data, in contrast to MDA-MB-435 cells, is that this cell line exhibits endogenous expression of both receptors, and the assumption can made that if Met function were dependent on α6β4, it should be evident in such a cell line. Based on several studies as well as the findings reported here, a consensus is emerging that α6β4 cooperates with growth factor receptors to promote carcinoma invasion and other functions (7Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Google Scholar, 18Gambaletta D. Marchetti A. Benedetti L. Mercurio A.M. Sacchi A. Falcioni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10604-10610Google Scholar, 25O'Connor K.L. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1749-1760Google Scholar). Perhaps the most conclusive evidence in this regard is the finding that macrophage-stimulating protein on binding to its receptor, the Ron tyrosine kinase, promotes an association between Ron and α6β4 that results in PI3K activation and consequent migration (4Santoro M.M. Gaudino G. Marchisio P.C. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 257-271Google Scholar). There is also evidence that α6β4 can cooperate with erbB2 in breast carcinoma cells to activate PI3K and promote invasion (18Gambaletta D. Marchetti A. Benedetti L. Mercurio A.M. Sacchi A. Falcioni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10604-10610Google Scholar). The conclusion that the function of one specific growth factor receptor (Met) is absolutely dependent on α6β4 for promoting invasion, however, is not supported by our data. A more appropriate assessment of the relationship between Met and α6β4 would be that expression of α6β4 can enhance invasion toward several growth factors, including HGF and lysophosphatidic acid, as well as those present in 3T3 cell-conditioned medium (Figs. 3 and 4). At the same time, our results indicate that the ability of Met to promote invasion is not dependent on α6β4 in these cells and that increasing Met expression in the absence of α6β4 enhances HGF-mediated invasion. The mechanism that underlies the ability of α6β4 to promote invasion likely involves its ability to stimulate PI3K. Compelling evidence exists for α6β4-mediated activation of this enzyme by mechanisms that include phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate proteins (26Shaw L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5082-5093Google Scholar), cooperation with erbB2 (18Gambaletta D. Marchetti A. Benedetti L. Mercurio A.M. Sacchi A. Falcioni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10604-10610Google Scholar, 19Falcioni R. Antonini A. Nistico P. Di Stefano S. Crescenzi M. Natali P.G. Sacchi A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 76-85Google Scholar) and Ron (4Santoro M.M. Gaudino G. Marchisio P.C. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 257-271Google Scholar), and the elaboration of vascular endothelial growth factor autocrine signaling (27Chung J. Bachelder R.E. Lipscomb E.A. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 165-174Google Scholar). In addition, the regulated expression of specific transcription factors such as nuclear factor of activated T cells by α6β4 may contribute to the invasive phenotype (28Jauliac S. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Shaw L.M. Brown L.F. Rao A. Toker A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 540-544Google Scholar). Clearly, Met is one of several growth factor receptors with a function that may be enhanced by α6β4 expression but that can signal and promote invasion in the absence of α6β4 expression. The challenge ahead is to define the mechanisms by which expression of α6β4 enhances the function of multiple growth factor receptors. We thank Drs. Robin Bachelder and Isaac Rabinovitz for valuable discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2018495872,"The expression of intron-containing messages has been shown to occur in a variety of diseases including lactic acidosis, Cowden Syndrome, and several cancers. However, it is unknown whether these intron-containing messages result in protein production in vivo. Indeed, intron-containing RNAs are typically retained in the nucleus, targeted for degradation, or are repressed translationally. Here, we show that during vascular lesion formation in rats, an alternative isoform of the helix-loop-helix transcription factor Id3 (Id3a) generated by intron retention is abundantly expressed. We demonstrate that Id3 is expressed early in lesion formation when the proliferative index of the neointima is highest and that Id3 promotes smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and S-phase entry and inhibits transcription of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21Cip1. Using an Id3a-specific antibody developed by our laboratory, we show that Id3a protein is induced during vascular lesion formation and that Id3a expression peaks late when the proliferative index is low or declining and extensive apoptosis is observed. Furthermore, Id3a fails to promote SMC growth and S-phase entry or to inhibit p21Cip1 promoter transactivation. In contrast, Id3a stimulates SMC apoptosis and inhibits endogenous Id3 production. Adenoviral delivery of Id3a inhibited lesion formation in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries in vivo. These data describe a novel feedback loop whereby intron retention generates an Id3 isoform that acts to limit SMC growth during vascular lesion formation, providing the first evidence that regulated intron retention can modulate a pathologic process in vivo.

Modulation of vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) 1The abbreviations used are: SMC, smooth muscle cell; Ad, adenovirus; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; Her, herstatin. 1The abbreviations used are: SMC, smooth muscle cell; Ad, adenovirus; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; Her, herstatin. growth has emerged as a promising strategy for treating vascular proliferative disorders such as restenosis, vein graft failure, and transplant arteriopathy (1Morice M.C.

During vascular lesion formation, normally quiescent SMCs in the vessel wall re-enter the cell cycle, proliferate, and secrete matrix (3Lusis A.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 233-241Google Scholar). In addition to growth and proliferation, SMC in developing lesions demonstrate altered morphology and apoptotic activity (4Dzau V.J. Braun-Dullaeus R.C. Sedding D.G. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1249-1256Google Scholar). Apoptosis may function to limit SMC growth and lesion size in vivo and has been associated with changes in the stability of atherosclerotic plaques (5Bennett M.R. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 41: 361-368Google Scholar, 6Braganza D.M. Bennett M.R. Postgrad. Med. J. 2001; 77: 94-98Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the mechanisms that regulate SMC growth and apoptosis is of key importance. The Id class of helix-loop-helix proteins have been linked to cell-cycle control in a variety of cell types (7Barone M.V. Pepperkok R. Peverali F.A. Philipson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4985-4988Google Scholar, 8Peverali F.A. Ramqvist T. Saffrich R. Pepperkok R. Barone M.V. Philipson L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4291-4301Google Scholar). The Id family of proteins consists of four members, Id1-4, whose functions do not appear to be completely redundant (7Barone M.V. Pepperkok R. Peverali F.A. Philipson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4985-4988Google Scholar, 9Florio M. Hernandez M.C. Yang Hui Shu H.K. Cleveland J.L. Israel M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5435-5444Google Scholar, 10Iavarone A. Garg P. Lasorella A. Hsu J. Israel M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1270-1284Google Scholar). Id proteins act as dominant-negative transcription factors and appear to promote cellular proliferation by blocking basic helix-loop-helix-mediated transactivation of genes involved in cell-cycle control such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1 (11Prabhu S. Ignatova A. Park S.T. Sun X.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5888-5896Google Scholar, 12Matsumura M.E. Lobe D.R. McNamara C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7293-7297Google Scholar). Recently, Id3 has emerged as a key regulator of SMC proliferation. Id3 expression is induced in cultured SMC in response to angiotensin II and reactive oxygen species, and Id3 message expression is increased in vivo in SMC in response to vascular injury (13Matsumura M.E. Li F. Berthoux L. Wei B. Lobe D.R. Jeon C. Hammarskjold M.L. McNamara C.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 752-758Google Scholar, 14Mueller C. Baudler S. Welzel H. Bohm M. Nickenig G. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2423-2428Google Scholar). The Id3 gene encodes two distinct isoforms generated as a result of alternative splicing. Both messages of the rat gene termed Id3 and Id3a are expressed in vivo in SMC within vascular lesions. Id3a message, generated by retention of intron 1 in Id3 pre-mRNA, is normally absent from the vessel wall yet is abundantly expressed at late time points following vascular injury in rats. In addition, the message of the Id3a human homologue is expressed in advanced atherosclerotic plaques. Interestingly, Id3a inhibits growth and stimulates apoptosis in cultured SMC (13Matsumura M.E. Li F. Berthoux L. Wei B. Lobe D.R. Jeon C. Hammarskjold M.L. McNamara C.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 752-758Google Scholar). Intron-containing message expression has been associated previously with disease states such as breast and colon cancer (15Justman Q.A. Clinton G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20618-20624Google Scholar, 16Goodison S. Yoshida K. Churchman M. Tarin D. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1221-1228Google Scholar). However, intron-containing messages are frequently retained in the nucleus or targeted for degradation, preventing protein expression. In this study we provide the first evidence of intron retention giving rise to a distinct protein with important functional consequences in a disease model. Here we describe a novel feedback loop whereby Id3-induced SMC growth is limited by induction of Id3a via intron retention and show that Id3a expression following vascular injury inhibits lesion formation in vivo. Cell Culture—Primary rat aortic SMCs were obtained from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by enzymatic digestion and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) (Invitrogen) with 20% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Following the establishment of a cultured line, cells were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum. Id3-/- and wild-type littermate control mouse aortic SMCs were prepared as described above. Adenoviral Expression—The construction of Ad-Id3 and Ad-Id3a has been described previously (11Prabhu S. Ignatova A. Park S.T. Sun X.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5888-5896Google Scholar). Ad-GFP was purchased from the University of Iowa. Cultured rat aortic SMCs were infected with 25 multiplicities of infection of virus in serum-free medium. After 4 h, virus was removed and cells were cultured in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient Transfection—Transfections were performed using Fu-GENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Number Analysis—Cultured rat aortic SMCs were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 1,000 cells/well and infected with either Ad-GFP or Ad-Id3. Sorted SMCs were transfected with 0.5 μg of pAd-Lox GFP and 0.5 μg of empty pAdLox or pAdLox Id3. 24 h later, cells were harvested by scraping, and GFP-positive cells were sorted into 96-well plates at a density of 500 cell/well using a FACSVantage SE Turbo sorter (BD Biosciences). At the indicated time points following infection or seeding, cells were counted using a colorimetric cell number assay (Celltitre, Promega). S-phase Analysis—Cultured rat aortic SMCs were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 1,000 cells/well and infected with Ad-GFP, Ad-Id3, or Ad-Id3a. At the indicated time points, BrdUrd incorporation was measured according to the manufacturer's specifications (cell proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay BrdUrd, Roche Applied Science) and quantitated colorimetrically by measuring Abs370. Promoter Reporter Assays—Rat aortic SMCs were transfected with 0.9 μg of expression plasmids together with 0.1 μg of p21-luciferase or Id3-pGL3 reporter plasmids. 48 h following transfection, cells were harvested in luciferase lysis buffer, incubated with luciferase substrate (Promega), and measured for luciferase activity. Analysis of Apoptotic Activity—Cultured rat aortic SMCs infected with Ad-GFP, Ad-Id3, or Ad-Id3a and cytoplasmic histone-bound DNA fragments were measured using the cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science). Western Blotting—Lysates were collected in mPER lysis buffer (Pierce). Samples were electrophoresed with 4-20% SDS gradient gels (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Sigma). Western blotting was performed with antibodies to Id3 (0.5 μg/ml, C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p21 (1.0 μg/ml, BD Biosciences), α-tubulin (0.5 μg/ml, Sigma), or Id3a (1.0 μg/ml) followed by a 1:2,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rat Balloon Endothelial Denudation and Gene Delivery—The rat carotid endothelial denudation model was performed using 350 g of male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Laboratories, San Diego, CA) as described elsewhere (16Goodison S. Yoshida K. Churchman M. Tarin D. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1221-1228Google Scholar). Left common carotid arteries were blunt-dissected at the bifurcation, and internal and external carotids were ligated. A 1-cm tip percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty dilation catheter (Boston Scientific) was inserted through the external carotid into the common carotid, and endothelial denudation was performed by inflation of the balloon and three passages down the common carotid. For vessels treated with gene delivery, the common carotid artery was ligated ∼1 cm distal to the bifurcation and a polyethylene catheter, inserted through the external carotid, was used to deliver 100 μl of adenovirus (1 × 1010 plaque-forming unit). After a 20-min incubation, vessels were flushed with phosphate-buffered saline and blood flow was restored through the carotid artery. Vessel Harvesting and Immunohistochemistry—Rats were given an overdose of intraperitoneal ketamine/xlyazine, and animals were pressure-perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Injured arteries were removed and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C, dehydrated in a graded alcohol series, and paraffin-embedded for thin sectioning. 5-μm arterial sections were stained using the Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, UT) according to the manufacturer's instructions using a 1:100 dilution anti-Id3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or mouse monoclonal anti-Id3a antibody. Slides then were incubated for 30 min in 0.3% hydrogen peroxidase substrate (Sigma) for 2 min, counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Analysis of Vessel Morphometry—Five cross-sections from six (Ad-β-galactosidase) or seven (Ad-Id3a) balloon-injured in vivo fixed rat arteries were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Sigma). Cross-sections were imaged using an Olympus BH 2-RFCA microscope with an on-line CCD camera (Olympus DP-70). The circumference of the lumen, internal elastic lamina (IEL), and external elastic lamina (EEL) was measured and used to calculate neointima and medial area (Image-Pro Plus, Media Cybernetics, Carlsbad, CA). Statistical analysis was performed using a Mann-Whitney U test due to the small sample size. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Id3a Is Generated by Intron Retention—Alternative splicing of Id3 pre-mRNA resulted in messages encoding two distinct protein isoforms with different C termini (Fig. 1a). Id3 message is generated by the removal of both introns in the pre-mRNA. Id3a message is the result of inclusion of intron 1, a 115-bp sequence encoding a unique 29-amino acid C terminus. To examine the processing of Id3 pre-mRNA, we used three expression plasmid constructs for transient transfection of cultured SMCs: 1) a plasmid encoding full-length Id3 pre-mRNA containing intron 1 (pAdLox Id3 FL); 2) a plasmid encoding Id3 cDNA lacking intron 1 (pAdLox Id3); and 3) a plasmid encoding an Id3 construct that contains intron 1 but does not allow for removal of the intron (pAdLox Id3a) (Fig. 1b). This non-spliceable construct contains two point mutations (330G→ A and 409G→ A) disturbing both the 5′-splice site and a pseudo-splice site within intron 1 and a deletion removing the 3′-splice site (Fig. 1b). We transiently transfected SMC with empty vector, pAdLox Id3, pAdLox Id3-FL, and pAdLox Id3a and analyzed lysates by Western blotting. Because no commercial antibody to Id3a exists, we developed an Id3a-specific mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the predicted unique C terminus of the Id3a protein. The expression of full-length Id3 pre-mRNA in SMC resulted in the expression of the Id3 but not Id3a protein (Fig. 1c). This finding suggests that in cultured proliferating SMC, intron 1 is removed from Id3 pre-mRNA to yield the Id3 protein. Disturbing the splice sites in Id3 pre-mRNA resulted in the inclusion of intron 1 and thus the production of Id3a, providing evidence that intron retention is the mechanism determining which message (and thus protein) is produced. Id3 and Id3a Proteins Are Expressed Differentially following Balloon Injury—We previously have used in situ hybridization to show that Id3a message is induced following vascular injury (13Matsumura M.E. Li F. Berthoux L. Wei B. Lobe D.R. Jeon C. Hammarskjold M.L. McNamara C.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 752-758Google Scholar). However, intron-containing messages are retained frequently in the nucleus or targeted for degradation, preventing protein expression. To determine whether the expression of the intron 1-containing Id3a message results in the expression of a unique protein in vivo, we analyzed the Id3 and Id3a protein expression following vascular injury. To determine the time course of Id3 and Id3a expression in vivo following balloon injury, we used the rat carotid injury model (17Kantor B. Ashai K. Holmes Jr., D.R. Schwartz R.S. Cardiovasc. Radiat. Med. 1999; 1: 48-54Google Scholar) and harvested vessel lysates at various time points following injury for Western blot analysis (Fig. 2, a and b). Id3 protein expression present at low levels in uninjured control vessels was increased by 3 days post-injury, peaked at 7 days, and returned to base-line levels by 28 days. In contrast, Id3a protein not detected in uninjured arteries was induced following injury, peaked at 14 days post-injury, and remained high through 28 days. To confirm that our Id3a antibody does not cross-react with Id3 protein, we transfected HEK cells with Id3 or Id3a expression constructs (pAdLox Id3 and pAdLox Id3a) and examined lysates by Western blotting with our monoclonal Id3a antibody or a commercially available Id3 antibody (Fig. 2c). Our Id3a antibody reacted with ectopically expressed Id3a protein but showed no immunoreactivity with Id3. To examine the expression pattern of Id3 and Id3a in response to injury, we balloon-injured rat carotid arteries and fixed injured arteries 14 days later for immunohistochemistry. Id3 protein expression was observed in the media and in the developing neointima in injured vessels (Fig. 2, d and e). Id3a is abundantly expressed in the neointima of injured vessels but was absent from the media (Fig. 2, f and g). Id3 Enhances SMC Proliferation—To determine the time course of Id3-induced effects on SMC proliferation, we infected cells with an adenoviral construct encoding either Id3 cDNA (lacking intron 1, Ad-Id3) or GFP (Ad-GFP) and assayed for the cell number. Ad-Id3 infection resulted in a significant increase in cell number at 12 and 24 h post-infection (p < 0.03) with the effect at 24 h being marked (Fig. 3a). In agreement with this finding, cultured SMC from Id3-/- mice demonstrated significantly reduced proliferation in the presence of serum (Fig. 3b). Ad-Id3-infected SMC displayed increased S-phase entry as determined by BrdUrd incorporation 4 and 16 h (p < 0.03) post-infection (Fig. 3c). Consistent with this finding, Id3-/- SMC entered S-phase at a reduced rate (p < 0.003) when compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 3d). Recent data provide evidence that all of the functions of the Id proteins are not redundant (7Barone M.V. Pepperkok R. Peverali F.A. Philipson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4985-4988Google Scholar, 9Florio M. Hernandez M.C. Yang Hui Shu H.K. Cleveland J.L. Israel M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5435-5444Google Scholar, 10Iavarone A. Garg P. Lasorella A. Hsu J. Israel M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1270-1284Google Scholar). Id3 has been implicated in the regulation of p21Cip1 protein expression; however, the effects of Id3 on p21Cip1 promoter activity are unknown (11Prabhu S. Ignatova A. Park S.T. Sun X.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5888-5896Google Scholar, 14Mueller C. Baudler S. Welzel H. Bohm M. Nickenig G. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2423-2428Google Scholar). In promoter-reporter experiments, transient transfection of SMC with pAdLox Id3 was capable of dramatically inhibiting endogenous promoter activation of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21Cip1 (Fig. 3e, p < 0.003). Further, Id3-/- SMC displayed a significant increase in p21Cip1 promoter activation (p < 0.0006) and p21Cip1 protein levels relative to wild-type control SMC (Fig. 3f). The Effects of Id3a on SMC Growth and Viability—Previous studies have demonstrated that the E-protein E47 effectively activates p21Cip1 transcription, resulting in inhibition of cellular growth (11Prabhu S. Ignatova A. Park S.T. Sun X.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5888-5896Google Scholar). Accordingly, we evaluated the effect of Id3 and Id3a on E-protein-mediated p21Cip1 transcription in SMC using a p21Cip1 promoter-reporter construct. Co-transfection of SMC with pcDNA-E47 and pAdLox Id3 but not pAdLox Id3a reduces p21Cip1-luciferase activity (p < 0.01) to levels comparable to base line, demonstrating that Id3a lacks the ability of Id3 to block E47-mediated p21Cip1 transactivation. These observations are not attributable to differences in Id3 and Id3a expression, because both pAdLox Id3 and pAdLox Id3a transfection results in similar protein levels as detected by Western blot using an antibody to their common N terminus (Fig. 4a, inset). Consistent with these data and in contrast to Ad-Id3, infection of SMC with an Id3a-expressing adenovirus, Ad-Id3a, did not result in a significant difference in S-phase entry (Fig. 4b). Advanced vascular lesions demonstrate extensive apoptosis, a low proliferative index, and robust Id3a expression. Accordingly, we assayed the effects of Id3a on SMC proliferation and apoptosis. Results confirm that, relative to control plasmid, pAdLox Id3a expression inhibits SMC proliferation (Fig. 4c, p < 0.01). This finding correlates with the ability of Ad-Id3a to promote apoptosis in SMC 48 h following infection (Fig. 4d, p < 0.003). It is intriguing to postulate that Id3a acts as a negative feedback molecule to limit Id3-induced growth. Therefore, we examined the effect of Ad-Id3a on Id3 protein levels and found that Ad-Id3a infection results in a dose-dependent decrease in endogenous Id3 levels in SMC (Fig. 4e). Because Id3 acts as a transcription regulator, we hypothesized that Id3a inhibits Id3 expression at the level of transcription. When co-transfected with an Id3 luciferase promoter-reporter construct, pAdLox Id3a resulted in an ∼50% reduction in luciferase activity relative to empty vector (p < 0.001), whereas pAdLox Id3 had no significant effect on Id3 transcription (Fig. 4f). Overexpression of Id3a in Injured Vessels Inhibits Neointimal Formation—Given the ability of Id3a to inhibit SMC growth and promote SMC apoptosis and that Id3a expression in vivo peaks as neointimal SMC proliferation declines, Id3a may represent an endogenous mechanism whereby neointimal formation is limited. Therefore, we hypothesized that early Id3a overexpression may inhibit vascular lesion formation in response to injury. To examine the effects of Id3a gene expression on lesion formation, we infected rat carotid arteries with Ad-Id3a or Ad-β-galactosidase control virus immediately following balloon injury. 28 days following injury, arteries were fixed and embedded and vessel morphometry was analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Representative sections are shown (Fig. 5a and b). We assayed the effect of Id3a gene expression on neointimal formation by quantitating the intimal:medial ratio of injured vessels. Ad-Id3a delivery resulted in a 55% reduction in intimal:medial ratio when compared with Ad-β-galactosidase control virus (Fig. 5c; p < 0.05). These results indicate that Id3a expression in vivo reduces vascular lesion formation in response to injury. Regulation of protein expression by alternative splicing is emerging as a potentially important means by which vascular lesion formation is controlled. SMC migration and secretion of extracellular matrix play significant roles in lesion formation. Interestingly, the expression of fibronectin and tenascin-C, both extracellular matrix proteins, is regulated by alternative splicing following vascular injury in rats (19Dubin D. Peters J.H. Brown L.F. Logan B. Kent K.C. Berse B. Berven S. Cercek B. Sharifi B.G. Pratt R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1958-1967Google Scholar, 20Wallner K. Shah P.K. Sharifi B.G. Atherosclerosis. 2002; 161: 75-83Google Scholar). Further, it has been shown that the expression of RA301/Tra2β, an RNA-binding protein and putative splicing factor, is strongly up-regulated following balloon injury in rats (21Tsukamoto Y. Matsuo N. Ozawa K. Hori O. Higashi T. Nishizaki J. Tohnai N. Nagata I. Kawano K. Yutani C. Hirota S. Kitamura Y. Stern D.M. Ogawa S. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1685-1694Google Scholar). Therefore, it is intriguing to postulate that alternative splicing plays a central role in regulating SMC migration, proliferation, and extracellular matrix secretion by altering the expression of genes such as Id3, tenascin-C, and fibronectin. Here we describe, to our knowledge, the first example in an in vivo disease model of alternative protein expression from an intron-containing message. The expression of intron-containing messages has been described in cancer cells, such as Her-2 and CD44 messages in breast and colon cancer (15Justman Q.A. Clinton G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20618-20624Google Scholar, 16Goodison S. Yoshida K. Churchman M. Tarin D. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1221-1228Google Scholar). Retention of intron 8 in the Her-2 transcript results in a sequence coding for herstatin, a Her-2 isoform containing a unique C terminus. Recombinant herstatin protein is capable of antagonizing Her-2-mediated growth in breast cancer cells, and herstatin message is down-regulated in carcinoma cells, providing a potential link between herstatin production and growth inhibition in breast cancer, yet it remains unclear whether herstatin protein is produced in vivo (15Justman Q.A. Clinton G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20618-20624Google Scholar, 22Doherty J.K. Bond C. Jardim A. Adelman J.P. Clinton G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10869-10874Google Scholar, 23Jhabvala-Romero F. Evans A. Guo S. Denton M. Clinton G.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8178-8186Google Scholar). Protein expression from intron-containing message has been described in the literature (24Dytrych L. Sherman D.L. Gillespie C.S. Brophy P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5794-5800Google Scholar, 25Kazen-Gillespie K.A. Ragsdale D.S. D'Andrea M.R. Mattei L.N. Rogers K.E. Isom L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1079-1088Google Scholar) for several protein isoforms including periaxin and sodium channel subunits. However, the in vivo consequences of these events are not clear. During early stages of vascular lesion formation, the expression of the fully spliced Id3 protein is increased when the proliferative index of the neointima is high, suggesting that Id3 acts to promote SMC growth in response to vascular injury (26Hanke H. Strohschneider T. Oberhoff M. Betz E. Karsch K.R. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 651-659Google Scholar, 27Clowes A.W. Reidy M.A. Clowes M.M. Lab. Investig. 1983; 49: 327-333Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, ectopic Id3 expression promoted SMC proliferation and S-phase entry, whereas Id3-/- SMC displayed reduced proliferation and S-phase entry. It has been shown previously that other Id proteins promote cellular growth by negatively regulating transcription of cellcycle inhibitors such as p21Cip1 (11Prabhu S. Ignatova A. Park S.T. Sun X.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5888-5896Google Scholar, 12Matsumura M.E. Lobe D.R. McNamara C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7293-7297Google Scholar). Indeed, we show that Id3 inhibited endogenous and E47-driven p21Cip1 transcription in SMC and that Id3-/- SMC had markedly increased p21Cip1 transcription and protein levels, providing a mechanism for Id3-induced SMC proliferation. Retention of intron 1 in the Id3 message yields a distinct protein isoform termed Id3a, which encodes an alternative C terminus. Id3a protein expression is not observed in vivo in quiescent vessels but is induced following vascular injury. Unlike Id3, peak Id3a expression corresponds to time points late in lesion formation when the proliferative index of the neointima is declining or low and extensive apoptosis is observed (18Han D.K. Haudenschild C.C. Hong M.K. Tinkle B.T. Leon M.B. Liau G. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 267-277Google Scholar, 27Clowes A.W. Reidy M.A. Clowes M.M. Lab. Investig. 1983; 49: 327-333Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesize that Id3a functions as part of a negative feedback loop to limit pathologic SMC proliferation (Fig. 5d). This is in agreement with our cell culture data, indicating that Id3a expression causes a decrease in SMC proliferation and the onset of apoptosis as well as inhibition of Id3 expression. The ability of Id3a to inhibit neointimal formation in vivo when expressed immediately following vascular injury further supports this hypothesis. Our results provide the first evidence that regulated intron retention is a key step in controlling SMC growth and viability and vascular lesion formation. The mechanisms that regulate the splicing and translation of Id3a and other intron-containing messages may provide novel and important insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate cellular growth in response to vascular injury and other proliferative disorders.

https://openalex.org/W2050087851,"We have capitalized on the unique properties of the skin tumor promoter palytoxin, which does not activate protein kinase C, to investigate alternative mechanisms by which major signaling molecules can be modulated during carcinogenesis. We report here that palytoxin activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) through a novel mechanism that involves inactivation of an ERK phosphatase in keratinocytes derived from initiated mouse skin (308 cells). Use of U0126 revealed that palytoxin requires the ERK kinase MEK to stimulate ERK activity, although palytoxin did not activate MEK. We found that 308 keratinocytes highly express mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-3 (MKP-3), which selectively inactivates ERK. Palytoxin induced the loss of MKP-3 in a manner that corresponded to increased ERK phosphorylation. Complementary studies showed that sustained expression of exogenous MKP-3 inhibited palytoxin-stimulated ERK activation. As is characteristic of initiated keratinocytes, 308 cells express activated H-Ras. To investigate whether expression of oncogenic Ras is key to palytoxin-stimulated ERK activation, we determined how palytoxin affected ERK and MKP-3 in MCF10A human breast epithelial cells and in H-ras MCF10A cells, which stably express activated H-Ras. Palytoxin did not affect ERK activity in MCF10A cells, which had no detectable MKP-3. Like 308 cells, H-ras MCF10A cells highly express MKP-3. Strikingly, palytoxin stimulated ERK activity and induced a corresponding loss of MKP-3 in H-ras MCF10A cells. These studies indicate that in initiated cells palytoxin unleashes ERK activity by down-regulating MKP-3, an ERK inhibitor, and further suggest that MKP-3 may be a vulnerable target in cells that express oncogenic Ras.

Carcinogenic agents classified as tumor promoters have proven to be powerful tools for investigating critical biochemical events involved in carcinogenesis (1Yuspa S.H. J. Dermatol. Sci. 1998; 17: 1-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In the multistage mouse skin model of carcinogenesis the first rapid and irreversible stage, known as initiation, typically involves activation of the oncogene Ras (2Balmain A. Pragnell I.B. Nature. 1983; 303: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Tumor development requires the subsequent repeated stimulation by tumor promoters. The tumor promotion stage is prolonged and is reversible if tumor promoter treatment is ceased. Activation of Ras is a frequent early event in human cancers (3Downward J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar). Therefore, tumor promoters are excellent tools for identifying important molecular targets that are involved in carcinogenesis and for revealing how expression of oncogenic Ras makes cells susceptible to the subsequent action of tumor-promoting stimuli. The identification of protein kinase C as the receptor for the prototypical skin tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) 1The abbreviations used are: TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; AP-1, activator protein-1; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MKP, MAPK phosphatase; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; MEK, ERK kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; AP-1, activator protein-1; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MKP, MAPK phosphatase; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; MEK, ERK kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase. helped establish that tumor promotion involves the aberrant modulation of signaling cascades that govern cell fate and function (4Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5735) Google Scholar). Palytoxin belongs to a class of non-TPA-type tumor promoters that do not act through protein kinase C (5Fujiki H. Suganuma M. Nakayasu M. Hakii H. Horiuchi T. Takayama S. Sugimura T. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The novel properties of palytoxin make it a useful tool for investigating alternative mechanisms by which important targets in carcinogenesis can be modulated, which may be missed by the strong focus on TPA-stimulated signaling. The initial signals stimulated by palytoxin differ significantly from those stimulated by TPA (5Fujiki H. Suganuma M. Nakayasu M. Hakii H. Horiuchi T. Takayama S. Sugimura T. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 6Wattenberg E.V. Fujiki H. Rosner M.R. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 4618-4622PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wattenberg E.V. McNeil P.L. Fujiki H. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 213-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Palytoxin is a large (Mr 2,681), water-soluble polyalcohol isolated from zoanthids (genus Palythoa), which are closely related to sea anemones (8Moore R.E. Bartolini G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1981; 103: 2491-2494Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Palytoxin was classified as a non-TPA-type tumor promoter because, in contrast to TPA, palytoxin does not activate protein kinase C in vitro, or induce ornithine decarboxylase in mouse skin (5Fujiki H. Suganuma M. Nakayasu M. Hakii H. Horiuchi T. Takayama S. Sugimura T. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The putative palytoxin receptor is the Na+,K+-ATPase (9Habermann E. Toxicon. 1989; 27: 1171-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Palytoxin appears to bind to the Na+,K+-ATPase and stimulate ion flux by transforming the pump into an ion channel. Accordingly, stimulation of ion flux appears to be a critical component of palytoxin-stimulated signaling (7Wattenberg E.V. McNeil P.L. Fujiki H. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 213-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kuroki D.W. Minden A. Sanchez I. Wattenberg E.V. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1998; 151: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Previous studies by this laboratory indicated that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are potentially important mediators of palytoxin-stimulated signals (10Kuroki D.W. Minden A. Sanchez I. Wattenberg E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23905-23911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Li S. Wattenberg E.V. Toxicol. Appl.

Pharmacol. 2002; 185: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). MAPKs are a family of serine/threonine kinases that coordinate the transmission of various types of signals to specific cellular targets (14Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4307) Google Scholar, 15Chen Z. Gibson T.B. Robinson F. Silvestro L. Pearson G. Xu B.E. Wright A. Vanderbilt C. Cobb M.H. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2449-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). For example, once activated, MAPKs can translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, phosphorylate specific transcription factors, and thereby modulate gene expression (16Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). MAPKs regulate a wide variety of transcription factors that have been implicated in carcinogenesis including activator protein-1 (AP-1) (16Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar), which appears to be involved in tumor promotion (17Young M.R. Li J.J. Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Sathyanarayana B.K. Hunziker R. Colburn N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9827-9832Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 are three major MAPKs (14Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4307) Google Scholar, 15Chen Z. Gibson T.B. Robinson F. Silvestro L. Pearson G. Xu B.E. Wright A. Vanderbilt C. Cobb M.H. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2449-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Mitogenic agents typically activate ERK. Stress-inducing agents typically activate JNK and p38. Our early work suggested that palytoxin and TPA activate different MAPK family members, which was not surprising considering that palytoxin and TPA stimulate distinctly different initial signals. In COS7, HeLa, and Swiss 3T3 cells, palytoxin predominantly activates JNK and p38, but not ERK, whereas phorbol esters predominantly activate ERK, but not JNK or p38 (10Kuroki D.W. Minden A. Sanchez I. Wattenberg E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23905-23911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Li S. Wattenberg E.V. Toxicol. Appl.

We also found that palytoxin-stimulated MAPK signaling can differ depending on the cell type (12Li S. Wattenberg E.V. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 160: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This finding led us to investigate the effects of palytoxin and TPA on MAPK activity in a cell culture model of initiated keratinocytes, which are the likely target cells of skin tumor promoters in vivo. Surprisingly, we found that palytoxin activates ERK in a keratinocyte cell line derived from mouse skin initiated in vivo (308 cells), as does TPA (13Warmka J.K. Winston S.E. Zeliadt N.A. Wattenberg E.V. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2002; 185: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 19Strickland J.E. Greenhalgh D.A. Koceva-Chyla A. Hennings H. Restrepo C. Balaschak M. Yuspa S.H.

Commun. 2004; 317: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In 308 keratinocytes, palytoxin stimulates ERK-dependent gene expression and modulation of transcription factors involved in tumor promotion. These studies suggested that in the relevant target cells of tumor promoters the distinct signaling pathways stimulated by TPA and the non-TPA-type tumor promoter palytoxin converge to modulate ERK. ERK is a potentially critical common target of palytoxin and TPA because ERK modulates a constellation of downstream targets that are likely to be involved in carcinogenesis, including AP-1 (13Warmka J.K. Winston S.E. Zeliadt N.A. Wattenberg E.V. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2002; 185: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 17Young M.R. Li J.J. Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Sathyanarayana B.K. Hunziker R. Colburn N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9827-9832Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), and because aberrant regulation of ERK has been implicated as playing an important role in both the mouse skin model of carcinogenesis and in human carcinogenesis (21Huang C.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). These results also suggested that initiated keratinocytes express modulators of ERK activity that are particularly sensitive to palytoxin action. Thus, investigating how palytoxin activates ERK in initiated cells could reveal important alternative mechanisms by which ERK can be modulated and identify characteristics of these cells that make them susceptible to tumor promoter action. In the studies presented here, we investigated the mechanisms by which palytoxin activates ERK in the 308 mouse keratinocyte cell line. 308 cells express an activated H-Ras oncogene, which is characteristic of initiated mouse skin (2Balmain A. Pragnell I.B. Nature. 1983; 303: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 19Strickland J.E. Greenhalgh D.A. Koceva-Chyla A. Hennings H. Restrepo C. Balaschak M. Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 165-169PubMed Google Scholar). ERK activity is regulated through the reversible phosphorylation of specific tyrosine and threonine residues (15Chen Z. Gibson T.B. Robinson F. Silvestro L. Pearson G. Xu B.E. Wright A. Vanderbilt C. Cobb M.H. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2449-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 27Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 28Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation and activation of ERK typically occurs through stimulation of the Ras/Raf/MEK protein kinase cascade; the GTPase Ras activates the protein kinase Raf, which phosphorylates and activates the protein kinase MEK. MEK is highly specific for phosphorylating and activating ERK. MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) are a family of dual-specificity phosphatases that dephosphorylate both tyrosine and threonine residues, and specifically inactivate MAPKs, including ERK (27Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 28Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The results presented here demonstrate that palytoxin does not activate ERK in 308 cells through direct stimulation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK protein kinase cascade. Instead, we provide evidence that palytoxin increases ERK activity in 308 keratinocytes by inducing the loss of MKP-3, a phosphatase that is highly selective for desphosphorylating and inactivating ERK (29Muda M. Theodosiou A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U. Camps M. Gillieron C. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27205-27208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our results indicate that the ability of palytoxin to increase ERK activity by modulating MKP-3 is not unique to initiated keratinocytes, but instead may be characteristic of cells that express activated Ras oncogenes. Altogether, these studies suggest that MKP-3 may be a vulnerable target of tumor promoter action in cells that express oncogenic Ras.

Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Proteins from whole cell lysates (20 to 40 μg) were resolved using SDS-PAGE minigels, and then transferred to Immobilon-P-PDVF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Immunoblot analysis was conducted according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer of the primary antibody. The signal for all immunoblots was detected using the ECL detection system purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The following antibodies were used: phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) (E10) (mouse monoclonal), phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser-217/221) (rabbit polyclonal), and Myc-Tag (9B11) (mouse monoclonal) from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA), and ERK 2 (C-14) (rabbit polyclonal), MEK-1 (12-B) (rabbit polyclonal), MKP-1 (V-15) (rabbit polyclonal), MKP-2 (S-18) (rabbit polyclonal), MKP-3 (C-20) (goat polyclonal), and GST (B-14) (mouse monoclonal) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The following secondary antibodies were used: anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody and anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody from Cell Signaling, and bovine anti-goat IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Blots were stripped by incubating in diluted Re-Blot Plus Strong Antibody Stripping Solution (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA). Kinase Assays—The assay for GST-ERK activity was conducted by transfecting cells as described above. After the treatments described in the figure legends, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm leupeptin). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min. The protein concentration of the supernatant was quantitated using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). 100 μg of protein was incubated with 25 μl of glutathione immobilized on agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. The glutathione-GST complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer, then lithium chloride buffer (0.5 m LiCl, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6), followed by kinase buffer (50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.03% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2). The glutathione-GST complexes were then incubated in kinase buffer with 2 μg of GST-6His-Elk1 and 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. The proteins were resolved using 10% SDS-PAGE minigels. Phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography. The assay for MEK activity was conducted as follows. After the treatments described in the figure legends, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were frozen at -80 °C for 10 min, thawed at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min. The protein concentration of the supernatant was quantitated using the Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad). 200 μg of cell lysate was incubated with 5 μl of MEK1 antibody and 25 μl of protein A-agarose at 4 °C for 2 h. The immunocomplexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and incubated in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate) in the presence of 2 μg of inactive p42 MAPK (Cell Signaling) and 200 μm cold ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. The proteins were resolved using 10% SDS-PAGE minigels. Phosphorylation of inactive p42 MAPK (ERK2) was detected by immunoblot using an anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody. Densitometry—Phosphorylation and protein levels were quantified using a Bio-Rad Fluor-S MultiImager and Bio-Rad Quantity One software. Palytoxin Stimulates ERK Activity in 308 Cells—In contrast to what we observed in several different cell lines (10Kuroki D.W. Minden A. Sanchez I. Wattenberg E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23905-23911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Li S. Wattenberg E.V. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1998; 151: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Kuroki D.W. Bignami G.S. Wattenberg E.V. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 637-644PubMed Google Scholar), palytoxin stimulated ERK activation in 308 keratinocytes (Fig. 1). The activation of ERK by palytoxin was evident by 30 min and remained elevated for at least 8 h (data not shown). Palytoxin did not stimulate a detectable increase in ERK activity at time points measured prior to 30 min (data not shown). ERK activity was measured by immunoblot analysis and an antibody that specifically recognizes the dually phosphorylated, active form of ERK (Fig. 1, top panel). The phospho-ERK immunoblot was stripped and reprobed for total ERK (Fig. 1, bottom panel). Palytoxin also stimulated the kinase activity of ERK (data not shown). These results show that palytoxin stimulates an increase in ERK activity, but not an increase in total ERK levels. Palytoxin Does Not Stimulate MEK Activity—ERK is typically activated through stimulation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK protein kinase cascade (15Chen Z. Gibson T.B. Robinson F. Silvestro L. Pearson G. Xu B.E. Wright A. Vanderbilt C. Cobb M.H. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2449-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first investigated the role of MEK in palytoxin-stimulated ERK activation. Preincubation of 308 cells with 3 μm U0126, a specific MEK inhibitor, effectively blocked both basal and palytoxin-stimulated ERK activity (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that MEK is required for palytoxin-stimulated ERK activation. Surprisingly, complementary experiments showed that palytoxin does not stimulate MEK activity (Fig. 2B). MEK activity was measured by immunoblot analysis with an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated, active form of MEK (Fig. 2, top panel), and by immunoprecipitation of MEK followed by an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 2B, middle panel). In contrast to palytoxin, TPA, as a positive control, stimulated an increase in MEK phosphorylation (Fig. 2B, top panel) and MEK activity, as indicated by phosphorylation of ERK2, the substrate used in the in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 2B, middle panel). We consistently observed lower levels of total MEK in lysates from TPA-stimulated cells (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). TPA may stimulate the redistribution of MEK to insoluble cellular compartments. Altogether, these results indicate that while basal MEK activity is required for palytoxin-triggered ERK activity, MEK activity is not increased in response to palytoxin. The Phosphatase Inhibitors Sodium Orthovanadate and Okadaic Acid Activate Both MEK and ERK—The observation that palytoxin stimulates prolonged ERK activity (Fig. 1), but does not stimulate MEK activity (Fig. 2) led us to investigate whether palytoxin inhibits an ERK phosphatase that is expressed in 308 cells. Two major classes of phosphatases can dephosphorylate and inactivate ERK: protein-tyrosine phosphatases and serine/threonine phosphatases (28Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 30Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 31Zhan X.L. Wishart M.J. Guan K.L. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2477-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To help identify which class of phosphatase was the potential target of palytoxin we determined if sodium orthovanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, or okadaic acid, a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor, could mimic palytoxin action in 308 cells. Like palytoxin, sodium orthovanadate and okadaic acid stimulated ERK activity (Fig. 3, bottom panels). Unlike palytoxin, sodium orthovanadate and okadaic acid activated MEK (Fig. 3, top panels). Okadaic acid selectively inhibits the serine/threonine phosphatase protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) at the concentration used in these studies (30Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 32Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). Therefore, the observation that okadaic acid activates MEK indicates that palytoxin does not inhibit PP2A. Sodium orthovanadate is a general protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (33Zhao Z. Tan Z. Diltz C.D. You M. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22251-22255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 34Misra-Press A. Rim C.S. Yao H. Roberson M.S. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14587-14596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Interestingly, at early time points, sodium orthovanadate stimulates a disproportionately high level of ERK phosphorylation relative to MEK phosphorylation. For example, at the 30 min time point, okadaic acid stimulates an ∼2-fold increase in MEK phosphorylation and an ∼4-fold increase in ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3, right panels). By contrast, sodium orthovanadate stimulates an ∼3-fold increase in MEK phosphorylation, but an ∼36-fold increase in ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3, left panels). One possible explanation for these results is that sodium orthovanadate increases ERK phosphorylation by inhibiting tyrosine phosphatases that act directly on ERK, as well as by inhibiting tyrosine phosphatases that act upstream of ERK. Altogether, these results indicate that palytoxin does not inhibit the total spectrum of phosphatases inhibited by sodium orthovanadate, and furthermore suggest that 308 cells express protein-tyrosine phosphatases that can directly dephosphorylate ERK. 308 Cells Express High Levels of MKP-2 and MKP-3—MKPs are a class of protein-tyrosine phosphatases that can directly dephosphorylate MAPKs. MKP family members can differ with respect to several characteristics, including their selectivity for dephosphorylating ERK, JNK, and p38 and their tissue-specific expression (27Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 28Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). We next analyzed 308 cells for the expression of three MKPs that can dephosphorylate ERK and are widely expressed: MKP-1, MKP-2 and MKP-3. Immunoblot analysis showed that 308 cells express very low basal levels of MKP-1 (Fig. 4"
https://openalex.org/W2041804034,"We previously reported that Nek11, a member of the NIMA (never-in-mitosis A) family of kinases, is activated in G1/S-arrested cells. We provide herein several lines of evidence for a novel interaction between Nek11 and Nek2A. Both Nek11 and Nek2A, but not Nek2B, were detected at nucleoli, and the Nek2A-specific C-terminal end (amino acids 399-445) was responsible for nucleolar localization. Endogenous Nek11 coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous Nek2A, and non-catalytic regions of each kinase were involved in the complex formation. Nek11L interacted with phosphorylated Nek2A but barely with the kinase-inactive Nek2A (K37R) mutant. In addition, both Nek2A autophosphorylation activity and the Nek11L-Nek2A complex formation increased in G1/S-arrested cells. These results indicate that autophosphorylation of Nek2A could stimulate its interaction with Nek11L at the nucleolus. Moreover, Nek2 directly phosphorylated Nek11 in the C-terminal non-catalytic region and elevated Nek11 kinase activity. The non-catalytic region of Nek11 showed autoinhibitory activity through intramolecular interaction with its N-terminal catalytic domain. Nek2 dissociated this autoinhibitory interaction. Altogether, our studies demonstrate a unique mechanism of Nek11 activation by Nek2A in G1/S-arrested cells and suggest a novel possibility for nucleolar function of the NIMA family."
https://openalex.org/W2125252235,"The mini-hemoglobin from Cerebratulus lacteus (CerHb) belongs to a class of globins containing the polar Tyr-B10/Gln-E7 amino acid pair that normally causes low rates of O2 dissociation and ultra-high O2 affinity, which suggest O2 sensing or NO scavenging functions. CerHb, however, has high rates of O2 dissociation (kO2 = 200-600 s-1) and moderate O2 affinity (KO2 ≈1 μm-1) as a result of a third polar amino acid in its active site, Thr-E11. When Thr-E11 is replaced by Val, kO2 decreases 1000-fold and KO2 increases 130-fold at pH 7.0, 20 °C. The mutation also shifts the stretching frequencies of both heme-bound and photodissociated CO, indicating marked changes of the electrostatic field at the active site. The crystal structure of Thr-E11 → Val CerHbO2 at 1.70 Å resolution is almost identical to that of the wild-type protein (root mean square deviation of 0.12 Å). The dramatic functional and spectral effects of the Thr-E11 → Val mutation are due exclusively to changes in the hydrogen bonding network in the active site. Replacing Thr-E11 with Val “frees” the Tyr-B10 hydroxyl group to rotate toward and donate a strong hydrogen bond to the heme-bound ligand, causing a selective increase in O2 affinity, a decrease of the rate coefficient for O2 dissociation, a 40 cm-1 decrease in νCO of heme-bound CO, and an increase in ligand migration toward more remote intermediate sites."

Metallo-β-lactamases are bacterial enzymes that hydrolyze antibiotics of the β-lactam family. They are classified as class B (1Ambler R.P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. B Biol. Sci. 1980; 289: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar) or group 3 (2Bush K. Jacoby G. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar) β-lactamases. In the last decade, the discovery of an increasing number of new metallo-β-lactamases resulted in a subdivision into three molecular subclasses: B1, B2, and B3. Thereafter, a standard numbering scheme (3Galleni M. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Rossolini G.M. Spencer J. Dideberg O. Frère J.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 660-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) was adopted that identifies conserved residues involved in the catalytic activity. Subclass B3 β-lactamases are broad spectrum enzymes that require one or two Zn (II) ions for activity (4Wang Z. Fast W. Valentine A.M. Benkovic S.J. Curr. Opin. Struct.

To date, no structure of a subclass B2 enzyme is available. In subclass B3, the crystal structures of the metallo β-lactamases L1 from S. maltophilia (15Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R. Taylor I.A. Emery D.C. Verma C.S. Gamblin S.J. Spencer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and FEZ-1 from F. gormanii (16García-Sáez I. Mercuri P.S. Papamicael C. Kahn R. Frère J.M. Galleni M. Rossolini G.M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) have been solved. Comparison of the tertiary structures of the different enzymes highlighted similar organizations of the secondary structure elements; they all contain an αββα sandwich with two central β-sheets and α-helices on the external faces (10Carfi A. Pares S. Duée E. Galleni M. Duez C. Frère J.M. Dideberg O. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The active site with the binuclear zinc center is located at the bottom of the β-sheet core. Zn1 is tetrahedrally coordinated by three histidines, His116, His118, His196, and a water molecule. In the subclass B1 enzymes, Zn2 is coordinated by His263, Asp120, Cys221, and two water molecules to form a trigonal bipyramid. In subclass B3 β-lactamases, a Ser residue replaces Cys221, and His121 is the third ligand of Zn2. Our studies were performed on the FEZ-1 β-lactamase. FEZ-1 is a monomeric enzyme. The sequence of the mature protein is easily aligned with that of the L1 enzyme with 33% of isology (17Boschi L. Mercuri P.S. Riccio M.L. Amicosante G. Galleni M. Frère J.M. Rossolini G.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1538-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The two subclass B3 β-lactamases exhibit a broad activity spectrum against β-lactam antibiotics, but FEZ-1 shows a preference for cephalosporins (18Mercuri P.S. Bouillenne F. Boschi L Lamotte-Brasseur J. Amicosante G. Devreese B. van Beeumen J. Frère J.M. Rossolini G.M. Galleni M. Antimicrob.

Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 192-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the x-ray structures reveals similar zinc binding sites in FEZ-1 and L1. In L1, Ullah et al. (15Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R. Taylor I.A. Emery D.C. Verma C.S. Gamblin S.J. Spencer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) postulate that the carbonyl oxygen of the β-lactam substrate interacts with an oxyanion hole formed by Zn-1 and the side chain of Tyr228. This tyrosine is conserved and could play the same role in FEZ-1. In L1, the β-substituent on C-6 or C-7 of the β-lactam substrate generally fits in a hydrophobic pocket formed by the “flap” connecting β3 and β4, and by the loop between β3 and β8, which is considerably longer in subclass B3 enzymes than in subclass B1 (21Toney J.H. Fitzgerald P.M. Grover-Sharma N. Olson S.H. May W.J. Sundelof J.G. Vanderwall D.E. Cleary K.A. Grant S.K. Wu J.K. Kozarich J.W. Pompliano D.L. Hammond G.G. Chem.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14507-14514Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this pocket, the hydrophobic residues Phe156 and Ile162 of L1 are replaced by a Tyr and a Ser residue, respectively, in FEZ-1. These substitutions, together with Asn225, should influence the substrate specificity, with a facilitated interaction between FEZ-1 and β-lactams bearing a less hydrophobic β side chain (15Ullah J.H.

With the exception of GOB-1, all of the subclass B3 enzymes have a serine at position 221 (23Bellais S. Poirel L. Leotard S. Naas T. Nordmann P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3028-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The x-ray structures of L1 (15Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R. Taylor I.A. Emery D.C. Verma C.S. Gamblin S.J. Spencer J. J. Mol.

Biol. 2003; 325: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) indicate that this residue interacts with a water molecule (Wat2) linked to Zn2. Modeling studies suggest that Wat2 might play the role of proton donor to the nitrogen of the β-lactam ring. The interaction with Ser221 should help its positioning in the catalytic cavity. A typical structural aspect of L1 when compared with the other class B β-lactamases is the presence of an intramolecular disulfide bridge between Cys256 and Cys296. These residues are conserved in FEZ-1, but this enzyme contains an additional Cys200 close to the active site. Finally, L1 and FEZ-1 are a homotetramer and a monomer, respectively. In the L1 structure, one main interaction between two subunits involves the N terminus (15Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R. Taylor I.A. Emery D.C. Verma C.S. Gamblin S.J. Spencer J. J. Mol.

Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 1254-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was used as template in the PCR site-directed mutagenesis amplifications. The expression vector pET26b(+) (Novagen) was used for the construction of the T7-based expression plasmid. Chemicals and Antibiotics—The primers used for the mutagenesis were synthesized by Amersham Biosciences. The QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and the isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside was purchased from Eurogentech (Liège, Belgium). Chloramphenicol, ampicillin (Δϵ235 = -820 m-1 cm-1), cephalothin (Δϵ260 = -6500 m-1 cm-1), cefotaxime (Δϵ260 = -7500 m-1 cm-1), and cefuroxime (Δϵ235 = -7600 m-1 cm-1) were purchased from Sigma, and benzylpenicillin (Δϵ235 = -775 m-1 cm-1) was a gift from Rhône-Poulenc (Paris, France). Kanamycin was purchased from Merck, imipenem (Δϵ300 = -9000 m-1 cm-1) was a gift from Merck Sharp and Dohme, meropenem (Δϵ298 = -6500 m-1 cm-1) was from ICI Pharmaceuticals (Macclefield, UK), and biapenem (Δϵ294 = -9900 m-1 cm-1) was from Wyeth Lederle (Tokyo, Japan). Nitrocefin (Δϵ482 = +15,000 m-1 cm-1) was purchased from Unipath Oxoid (Basingstoke, UK). 7-Aminocephalosporanic acid (7-ACA) (Δϵ260 = -7500 m-1 cm-1) was a gift from GlaxoSmithKline. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The FEZ-1 mutants were obtained according to the instruction manual of the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The oligonucleotides (forward and reverse) used for the generation of the mutants are shown in Table I. PCR conditions were as follows: incubation at 95 °C for 30 s and 20 cycles of amplification (denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 68 °C for 10 min). After amplification, the PCR fragments were digested by the DpnI restriction enzyme in order to eliminate all nonmutated DNA. The digested plasmids were used to transform E. coli XL-1 Blue competent cells, and colonies were isolated on Luria Bertani (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) agar plates containing 50 μg/ml each ampicillin and kanamycin. The nucleotide sequences of the desired mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. Thereafter, the plasmids were digested by the NcoI and BamHI restriction enzymes, and the fragments were ligated into the pET26b(+) vector previously digested by the same enzymes to yield pDML1817-H121A, pDML1819-C200A, pDML1820-S221A, pDML1825-Y156A, pDML1826-S162A, pDML1827-N225A, and pDML1828-Y228A. Finally, E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells were transformed with the plasmids containing the different mutations.Table IMutagenic primers (5′ → 3′) used for the constructions of the FEZ-1 mutants.

Bouillenne F. Boschi L Lamotte-Brasseur J. Amicosante G. Devreese B. van Beeumen J. Frère J.M. Rossolini G.M. Galleni M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 1254-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in two purification steps. After the second step, the fractions that exhibited β-lactamase activity were collected and concentrated on a YM-10 membrane (Amicon, Beverly, MA) to a final concentration of about 1 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce), and the absorbance at 280 nm was also measured. The purity and the molecular masses of all purified proteins were confirmed by determining the molecular mass values with the help of an electrospray mass spectrometer (VG Bio-Q) upgraded with a Platform source (Micromass, Altrincham, UK). The samples (100 pmol) were dissolved in 0.05% formic acid, 50% acetonitrile in water and injected into the source of the mass spectrometer with a syringe pump (Harvard Instruments, South Natick, MA) at a flow rate of 6 μl/min. Metal Content Analysis—The zinc content of the enzyme was measured by atomic absorption in the flame mode using a PerkinElmer 2100 spectrometer. Before the metal analyses, 1 ml of a 40 μm protein solution was dialyzed three times during 8 h at 4 °C against 1 liter of double-distilled metal-free water containing 10 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 6. The zinc content of this dialysis buffer was about 400 nm. The final dialysis buffers were used as blanks. Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically by using ϵ280 nm = 28,000 m-1 cm-1. The metal content values reported for each sample are averages of results from three independent experiments. Kinetic Studies—The hydrolysis of all antibiotics was monitored by following the absorbance variation resulting from the opening of the β-lactam ring, using a Uvikon 860 spectrophotometer equipped with thermostatically controlled cells and connected to a Copam PC 88C microcomputer. Cells with 0.2-1.0-cm path lengths were used depending on the substrate concentration. The kinetic parameters were determined either under initial rate conditions, using both Hanes' linearization of the Henri-Michaelis equation and a direct nonlinear regression with the hyperbolic equation or by analyzing the complete hydrolysis time courses, as described by De Meester et al. (26De Meester F. Joris B. Reckinger G. Bellefroid-Bourguignon C. Frère J.M. Waley S.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 2393-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The reported kinetic parameters values are the means of at least three experiments in which the different enzymes were added to the substrate solutions prepared in buffers containing the stated Zn2+ concentrations. All experiments were performed at 30 °C in 10 mm cacodylate, pH 6.0. Bovine serum albumin (20 μg/ml) was added to diluted β-lactamase solutions in order to prevent enzyme denaturation. The heat stability of the different proteins was characterized. The enzymes (0.1 mg) were incubated at 50 °C in 10 mm cacodylate, pH 6.0. Aliquots were withdrawn after increasing periods of time, and the residual activity was measured against 1 mm benzylpenicillin. Molecular Modeling—The S221A mutant model was based on the three-dimensional structure of FEZ-1 enzyme (16García-Sáez I. Mercuri P.S. Papamicael C. Kahn R. Frère J.M. Galleni M. Rossolini G.M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The molecular model was built using the Homology module of the Insight program (Molecular Simulations, San Diego, CA), running on a Silicon Graphics work station. After model building, energy minimization was achieved using the Discover module of the same package to avoid bad molecular contacts. Finally, the geometric features were analyzed with the Insight II program. Inhibition of Y228A Mutant by the Hydrolysis Cephalosporin Products—The progressive inactivation of the enzyme was monitored by analyzing the hydrolysis time course of different nitrocefin or cefuroxime concentrations in 10 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0. In addition, 10 ml of 100 μm cefuroxime, cefotaxime, or cephalothin were hydrolyzed by 15 μg of FEZ-1 β-lactamase in 1 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 6. The hydrolysis of the cephalosporins was followed by recording the absorbance variation at 260 nm. After completion, the hydrolyzed antibiotics were separated from the enzyme by ultrafiltration on a YM-10 membrane (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The filtrates were collected and freezedried. The powders were resuspended in water to a final concentration of hydrolyzed product of 1 mm. The activity of the Y228A mutant was measured in the presence of different concentrations of the hydrolyzed cephalosporins. The variations of the pseudo-first-order inactivation rate constant ki were also determined as a function of the hydrolyzed cephalosporin concentration (26De Meester F. Joris B. Reckinger G. Bellefroid-Bourguignon C. Frère J.M. Waley S.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 2393-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structural Determination of the FEZ-1 Y228A Mutant—Crystals of the Y228A mutant were obtained by vapor diffusion in hanging drops at 8 °C by mixing 1 μl of protein (11 mg/ml) in 15 mm sodium cacodylate/cacodylic acid, pH 6.0, with 1 μl of 20% polyethylene glycol MME 5000, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate/cacodylic acid, pH 6.0, and then adding 0.1 mm zinc acetate to a final concentration of 10 μm. Crystals were grown as needles, which reached dimensions of 500 × 30 × 30 μm in 3 weeks. They were monoclinic and belonged to space group P21, with unit cell parameters of a = 44.76 Å, b = 77.43 Å, c = 78.50 Å, α = γ = 90°, β = 101.70°, with two molecules per asymmetric unit. A data set at 2.0 Å was collected using a Nonius FR-591 rotating anode x-ray generator running at 40 kV and 100 mA (λ = 1.5418Å), coupled to an image plate. The crystal was flash-frozen directly in the cryostream (100 K using an Oxford Cryosystems liquid nitrogen cryostat) after a short soaking in crystallization solution added with 20% glycerol. Data were processed and scaled using DENZO/SCALEPACK (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38251) Google Scholar) and SCALA (28Project Collaborative Computing Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using CNS (29Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. De Lano W.L. Gros P.

Galleni M. Rossolini G.M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), with Tyr228 being replaced by Ala (16García-Sáez I. Mercuri P.S. Papamicael C.

Cycles of model building, energy minimization, water-picking, and individual B-factor refinement using CNS gave a final model with Rworking = 18.6% and Rfree = 21.6%, with ∼10% of the data set aside for cross-validation. MALDI-TOF 1The abbreviations used are: MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; ESI, electrospray ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; 7-ACA, 7-aminocephalosporanic acid. Measurements of Y228A Mutant and FEZ-1 WT—The mutant enzyme FEZ-1 Y228A and FEZ-1 WT (30 μm) were incubated with cefuroxime in a 1:1 ratio. The reaction was stopped after 15 min by denaturing the enzyme in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. The enzyme-cefuroxime complex was measured using a ESI-Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Micromass, UK), equipped with a nanospray source using gold/palladium-coated borosilicate needles purchased from Protana (Odense, Denmark). The capillary voltage was set at 1250 V, and the cone voltage was set at 40 V. Acquisition time was 2-3 min across an m/z range of 400-2500. The mass spectra were processed using the MassLynx version 3.1 software of Micromass. For peptide mapping, the enzyme-cefuroxime complex (200 pmol) was diluted in 100 μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8, and proteolyzed for 3 h at 37 °C by 0.1 μg of trypsin. For ESI-MS of the peptide mixture, the solution was diluted in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid and measured using the ESI-Q-TOF MS as described above. For MALDI-TOF analysis, 1 μl of peptide solution was mixed with 1 μl of 50 mm α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. A volume of 1 μl of this mixture was spotted on a metal target, dried in the air, and measured on a MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (4700 Proteomics Analyzer; Applied Biosystems). The expression of all proteins was done in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS. Production of β-lactamases was tested at three temperatures, 37, 28, and 18 °C, in presence of 0.5 or 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside. Enzyme production was estimated by measuring the activity of crude extracts against cefuroxime and by SDS-PAGE. For the S162A and C200A variants, no β-lactamase production was found either in soluble or insoluble form. These substitutions appeared to impede the correct folding of the protein and yielded an unstable protein. In the case of Ser162, the comparison of the L1 and FEZ-1 structures reveals the presence of a two-residue insertion (Asn159-Asp160) in the FEZ-1 sequence (16García-Sáez I. Mercuri P.S. Papamicael C. Kahn R. Frère J.M. Galleni M. Rossolini G.M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The insertion generates a very short 310 helix stabilized by a hydrogen bond formed by the side chain interaction between Asp160 and Ser162. In addition, Cys200 is close to the active site and involved in a large network of hydrogen bonds. For all of the other mutants, the maximal production in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS was obtained at 28 °C 6 h after the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside. The mutants were purified as described for the wild type FEZ-1 (17Boschi L. Mercuri P.S. Riccio M.L. Amicosante G. Galleni M. Frère J.M. Rossolini G.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1538-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The yields after purification could be estimated to be 4-8 mg/liter for the different enzymes. At 30 °C the apparent stabilities of the WT and mutant enzymes were similar. At 50 °C, the Y156A, S221A, N225A, and Y228A mutants were rapidly inactivated (t½ < 15 min). In the case of mutant H121A, the enzyme was inactive after 15 min of incubation at 50 °C, but the addition of 100 μm zinc (final concentration) yielded an enzyme as stable as the wild type. Metal analyses of wild type FEZ-1 demonstrated that the enzyme binds 1.8 ± 0.2 Zn(II) ions per molecule. The Y156A, S221A, N225A, and Y228A mutants were found to also bind two zinc ions at an external zinc concentration of 0.4 μm. Under the same conditions, one zinc ion was found per H121A molecule. Thus, the substitution markedly reduced the affinity of the β-lactamase for the second zinc ion. Unexpectedly, despite the fact that all of the proteins but H121A appeared to contain a full complement of two zinc ions at an external zinc concentration of 0.4 μm, the addition of 100 μm Zn to the incubation medium significantly modified the kinetic parameters in a few cases. This observation remains presently unexplained unless one assumes that the opportunities for the second zinc might be specifically decreased by the substrate. With the exception of benzylpenicillin, all of the Km values were not dependent on the zinc ion concentration and were similar to those computed for the wild type enzyme (Table II). By contrast, at low [Zn2+], the catalytic constant kcat and the catalytic efficiencies kcat/Km of H121A were reduced 3-30-fold compared with the WT. The substitution of His121 allowed the production of a monozinc form at low external concentration of metal ions. The addition of zinc to the reaction mixture increased the catalytic efficiency of H121A mainly by increasing the kcat value. This behavior reflects the appearance of a dizinc H121A at high [Zn2+], which was nearly as active as the wild type FEZ-1. The [Zn2+] dependence of kcat and Km was measured with nitrocefin. As expected, Km values remained constant for all of the tested [Zn2+], but the kcat values increased up to 5 μm. Further changes were observed at high [Zn2+] (kcat = 220 s-1 at [Zn] > 5 μm) (Fig. 1). Based on these data, we can postulate that the apparent dissociation constants for zinc of the monozinc and dizinc forms of H121A FEZ-1 are lower than 0.4 and 2.5 μm, respectively. The modification of a ligand for the second zinc ion thus had a strong impact on the catalytic properties of the enzyme. A similar although more important phenomenon was observed in the case of the B. cereus metallo-β-lactamase (BcII). In that enzyme, the replacement of Cys221 by alanine or serine yields a poorly active monozinc enzyme, whereas the dizinc form is nearly as active as the wild type BcII (30de Seny D. Heinz U.

https://openalex.org/W2147256608,"Vancomycin, the last line of defense antibiotic, depends upon the attachment of the carbohydrate vancosamine to an aglycone skeleton for antibacterial activity. Vancomycin is a naturally occurring secondary metabolite that can be produced by bacterial fermentation. To combat emerging resistance, it has been proposed to genetically engineer bacteria to produce analogues of vancomycin. This requires a detailed understanding of the biochemical steps in the synthesis of vancomycin. Here we report the 1.4 A structure and biochemical characterization of EvaD, an RmlC-like protein that is required for the C-5' epimerization during synthesis of dTDP-epivancosamine. EvaD, although clearly belonging to the RmlC class of enzymes, displays very low activity in the archetypal RmlC reaction (double epimerization of dTDP-6-deoxy-4-keto-D-glucose at C-3' and C-5'). The high resolution structure of EvaD compared with the structures of authentic RmlC enzymes indicates that a subtle change in the enzyme active site repositions a key catalytic Tyr residue. A mutant designed to re-establish the normal position of the Tyr increases the RmlC-like activity of EvaD."

Type IV pili have long been recognized as major bacterial virulence-associated adhesins that promote bacterial attachment to host cells (1Hahn H.P. Gene. 1997; 192: 99-108Google Scholar). The genome of the typhoid fever bacterium, Salmonella typhi, contains a large insertion or “pathogenicity island” that is not found in the chromosome of the non-invasive Salmonella typhimurium (2Zhang X.-L. Morris C. Hackett J. Gene. 1997; 202: 139-146Google Scholar). DNA sequencing within the novel pathogenicity island (Salmonella pathogenicity island 7) identified a pil operon (11 genes, from PilL to PilV) that contains genes required for biosynthesis of Type IV pili in S. typhi (3Zhang X.-L.

The structural pilin protein (PilS) of the Type IV pili interacts with the first extracellular domain (residues 103–117) of CFTR (3Zhang X.-L. Tsui S.-M.I. Yip M.-C.C. Fung W.-Y.A. Wong K.-H.D.

Type IV pilins are further classified into Type IVa and IVb pilins according to the length of their signal peptides and the identities of the first residues of the mature pilins. Type IVa pilin has a much shorter signal peptide than Type Ivb, and the N-terminal residue of the mature pilin is always an N-methylated phenylalanine, whereas the N-terminal residue of Type IVb pilin may be either methionine or leucine (6Sakai D. Komano T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 444-451Google Scholar). Type IVa pili are found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeaem, and Mycobacterium bovis.

Both mature Type IVa and IVb pilins contain an N-terminal hydrophobic region of ∼24 residues (Fig. 1) that is believed to be the oligomerization domain required for Type IV pilus assembly through the “general assembly pathway” (11Soto G.E.

The ladle-shaped Type IVa pilin adopts an αβ roll fold with a very long and bent N-terminal hydrophobic α-helix. Assembly of the helical pilus is proposed to form a core of coiled α1 helices banded by β-sheets, leaving hypervariable disulfide-bonded loop regions exposed for receptor binding, although the tip-located adhesin is also involved in receptor binding (15Rudel T. Scheuerpflug I. Meyer T.F. Nature. 1995; 373: 357-359Google Scholar). This is in contrast to Type I pili, P pili, and Cs1 pili, which use exclusively their tip adhesins, FimH, PapG, and CooD respectively, for receptor binding (16Choudhury D. Thompson A. Stojanoff V. Langermann S. Pinkner J. Hultgren S.J. Knight S.D. Science. 1999; 285: 1061-1066Google Scholar, 17Kuehn M.J. Heuser J. Normark S. Hultgren S.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 252-255Google Scholar, 18Sakellaris H. Munson G.P. Scott J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12828-12832Google Scholar). Very recently, the structure of a Type IVb pilin (Tcp of V. cholerae) was solved by x-ray crystallography (19Craig L. Taylor R.K. Pique M.E. Adair B.D. Arvai A.S. Singh M. Lloyd S.J. Shin D.S. Getzoff E.D. Yeager M. Forrest K.T. Tainer J.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1139-1150Google Scholar). The structure of the Tcp pilin revealed a novel fold of pilin and suggested a different manner of pilus assembly compared with that of Type IVa pilins. Here, we present the NMR solution structure of the N-terminal-truncated Type IVb PilS from S. typhi. The S. typhi PilS shares a common topology with the V. cholerae Tcp pilin but with many distinct structural differences in both the αβ loop and D region. A structural model of S. typhi pilus is proposed based on the model of V. cholerae Tcp. The structural differences between these two Type IVb pilins allow a very different surface to be exposed on S. typhi pilus, which may represent a potential binding site for CFTR. Expression and Purification of PilS—The DNA fragment for S. typhi t-PilS (residues 26–181) was subcloned between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of a modified pET-32a (Novagen) vector with S-tag and thioredoxin gene removed. The correct sequence of the construct was confirmed by Big-dye sequencing. The His-tagged protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells as inclusion bodies (induction with 0.3 mm final concentration of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; cells were grown at 37 °C). Nine extra residues from the vector (GSAMADIGS) remain N-terminal to residue Met-26 of PilS after thrombin cleavage. The pellet of the expressed inclusion bodies was purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) using buffers containing 6 m GdnCl. The purified protein was refolded by rapid dilution (30×) into ice-cold buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9) with stirring. Residual GdnCl was removed by dialysis, and proper folding of the soluble protein was checked by far-UV CD. The refolded protein was concentrated and cleaved with thrombin (3 units/mg protein) before further purification on a Sephacryl S-100 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9 + 0.5 m NaCl) for NMR studies. The DNA fragments for PilS (residues 1–181) and its mutants were subcloned between BamHI and EcoRI site of the same vector. All mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The proteins were expressed as inclusion bodies in BL21(DE3) by inducing at a cell density of A600 = 0.6 and at 30 °C. The inclusion body pellets were resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm Imidazole) with 2% v/v Triton-X100 and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The proteins were bound onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resins, washed, and eluted with buffers that did not contain Triton X-100. The eluted proteins were further purified on a MonoQ ion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) before being used for binding assays. NMR Spectroscopy and Structure Calculation—Purified t-PilS protein was concentrated to ∼1 mm and buffer-exchanged to 50 mm phosphate, pH 6.0, with 0.5 m sodium sulfate for NMR studies. NMR experiments were performed on a 500-MHz Bruker DRX spectrometer equipped with cryoprobe or a 750-MHz Varian Inova spectrometer at 30 °C. Sequence-specific backbone assignments were done by HNCACB (20Wittekind M. Mueller L. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1993; 101: 201-205Google Scholar), CBCA(CO)NH (21Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1993; 3: 185-204Google Scholar), HNCO, and HN(CA)CO experiments using a 15N-13C uniformly labeled sample. Side chain assignments were obtained from H(CCO)NH, (H)CC(CO)NH (22Grzesiek S. Anglister J. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1993; 101: 114-119Google Scholar), and HCCH-TOCSY (23Kay L.E. Xu G.Y. Singer A.U. Muhandiram D.R. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; B 101: 333-337Google Scholar) spectra. The stereo-specific assignment of methyl groups was obtained by analyzing the 1H-13CHSQC spectrum of a 10% 13C-labeled sample (24Szyperski T. Neri D. Leiting B. Otting G. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 323-334Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond restraints from amide hydrogen exchange were determined by recording the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of a sample left in 99% D2O buffer for 6 h. Proton distance constraints were derived from three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY (mixing time 150 ms) and three-dimensional 13C-edited NOESY. NMR data were processed using the MMRPipe/NMRDraw (25Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Google Scholar) suite and analyzed by NMRView (26Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Google Scholar). The initial structures of t-PilS were generated by DYANA (27Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Google Scholar) using manually assigned unambiguous NOE restraints from 15N-NOESY and 13C-NOESY and dihedral angle restraints predicted by TALOS (28Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Google Scholar). Many other NOE cross-peaks in the two NOESY spectra were further assigned by CYANA (29Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Google Scholar) automatically. The unambiguous NOE restraints, automatically assigned NOE restraints, dihedral angle restraints, and hydrogen bond restraints were used for structure calculation. One hundred structures were calculated by DYANA using standard TAD protocol, and 20 conformers with the lowest target function values were selected for further energy refinement in AMBER 7.0 (30Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.R. Cheatham III, T.E. DeBolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Google Scholar). The final ensemble of 10 structures with the lowest amber energies was checked by Procheck-NMR (31Laskowski R.A. Rullman J.A. Mac-Arthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Google Scholar) and deposited at the Protein Data Bank. Model of PilS Pilus—The two subunits of PilS were first docked manually using the program “O” in such a manner that α2 is in close vicinity to α4. The interface was then refined using the program MULTIDOCK with the following parameters. To define the interface, a distance cut-off of 15 Å (cut_iface) was used to include the region for multiple copy side chain rotamer representation. A relatively large distance cut-off of 200 Å (cut_jface) was used to include the whole molecule for fixed side chain representation. For mean field optimization performed at 298.0 K, a residue-residue non-bonded cut-off distance of 15 Å (cut_res_nb) was used. The criterion for convergence in terms of change in energy was set at 0.4 kcal/mol (emax). For rigid body energy minimization, a distance cut-off of 15 Å (cut_lface) across the interface was used for inclusion of residues in the calculation of non-bonded interaction. The maximum rotation step size was 1° and maximum translation step size 0.3 Å. Minimization continued until the energy of the system decreased by less than 1× e–6 kcal/mol (ftol) for any given step. The energy cap for the number of atom-atom van der Waals clashes was set at 2.5 kcal/mol (eatmax). Inhibition of Bacterial Entry Experiment—The procedures for inhibition of bacterial entry into human intestinal cells by recombinant PilS proteins were described elsewhere (3Zhang X.-L. Tsui S.-M.I. Yip M.-C.C. Fung W.-Y.A. Wong K.-H.D. Dai X.-Y. Yang Y.-H. Hackett J. Morris C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3067-3073Google Scholar). Human embryonic intestinal cells INT407 were grown in tissue culture flasks and seeded in 24-well plates to obtain a monolayer in basal medium Eagle's with 15% calf serum (BME) by cultivating overnight at 37 °CinaCO2 incubator. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed with 1× PBS. 0.35 ml of fresh BME was added, followed by 100 μl of solutions of PilS or mutant PilS to a final protein concentration of 2 μm (1× PBS was used as a control for 100% invasion) and then 50 μlof S. typhi bacterial cells in saline (∼3.6 × 107 cells). The mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 2,164 × g and incubated for 2 h to allow bacterial invasion. The culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with 1× PBS. 0.5 ml of fresh BME with 100 μg/ml gentamycin was added, and the cells were incubated for 1 h to kill S. typhi that remained outside the intestinal cells. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with 1× PBS to remove any trace of gentamycin. 1 ml of 0.02% Triton X-100 was added, and the cells were pipetted up and down to ensure that the intestinal cells were detached and lysed to release the S. typhi cells. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before spreading onto agar plates (with kanamycin) for cell counts. Structure of S. typhi PilS—The construct used for the PilS structural determination is N-terminal-truncated (Met-26-Gly-181, referred as t-PilS), and the truncation of the N-terminal 25 residues is necessary to prevent the pilin from oligomerization. The three-dimensional structure of t-PilS was solved by NMR spectroscopy (Table I). Fig. 2A shows a stereoview of the best fit superposition of the family of 15 final structures of t-PilS. The N-terminal five residues of t-PilS (residues 26–30) are not well defined because of the lack of structural restraints. The other less defined regions in the protein include the loop between helices α1 and -2 (residues 49–60), the loop between strands β1 and -2 (residues 84–86), the loop between strands β3 and -4 (residues 105–112), and the loop between helix α4 and strand β7 (residues 164–171). Residues in these regions have relatively fewer NOE restraints compared with the well defined regions and are likely to be intrinsically more flexible.Table IStructural statistics for the S. typhi t-PilS proteinRestraints for calculationTotal NOE restraints2033Intraresidue905Sequential534Medium range225Long range369Hydrogen bond distance restraints76Dihedral angle constraints206CYANA target function1.23 ± 0.14Maximum violation for upper limits (Å)0.25 ± 0.08Maximum violation for torsion angles (degree)3.78 ± 0.76AMBER energies (kcal/mol)Total energy-3,658 ± 32Ramachandran statistics (%)Most favored68.1Additionally allowed27.6Generously allowed3.0Disallowed1.2Root mean square deviation from mean structure (Å)Backbone atoms (secondary structure region)0.68All heavy atoms (secondary structure region)1.10 Open table in a new tab The structure of t-PilS reinforces that Type IVb pilins adopt very different folding topologies compared with the structures of Type IVa pilin. The extended N-terminal α-helix (helix α1) is packed against three antiparallel β-strands (strands β3, -4, and -7) to form the hydrophobic core of the protein. The N-terminal αβ loop on one edge of the β-sheet contains a short α-helix (helix α2) and a pair of well defined antiparallel β-strands (strands β1 and -2). This is in contrast to the sugar loop and minor β-strands found in the αβ loop of MS11 and PAK pilins, respectively. The C-terminal disulfide-bonded region on the other edge of the β-sheet contains a pair of α-helices (helices α3 and -4) lying on top of two shorter antiparallel β-strands (strands β5 and -6). The seven β-strands align in an antiparallel manner to form a continuous but twisted β-sheet with all helices on one side of the β-sheet (Fig. 2, A and B). In Type IVa pilins, the hypervariable disulfide loop contains either a β-hairpin connected to a loop (12Parge H.E. Forest K.T. Hickey M.J. Christensen D.A. Getzoff E.D. Tainer J.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 32-38Google Scholar) or β-turns connected to each other (14Keizer D.W. Slupsky C.M. Kalisiak M. Campbell A.P. Crump M.P. Sastry P.A. Hazes B. Irvin R.T. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24186-24193Google Scholar, 32Campbell A.P. Bautista D.L. Tripet B. Wong W.Y. Irvin R.T. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12791-12801Google Scholar). These differences may relate to the fact that Types IVa and IVb pili have completely different receptor substrate specificities. Although topologically similar, t-PilS contains distinct structural features in both the αβ loop and D region when compared with Tcp (Fig. 2C). The αβ loop of t-PilS contains an extra pair of antiparallel β-strands (strands β1 and -2) between helix α2 and strand β3. The corresponding region in the Tcp pilin, between helix α2 and strand β1, is replaced with an extended loop of 18 residues (Fig. 1). The extra pair of β-strands in t-PilS aligns continuously at the edge of the major β-sheet (strands β3, -4, and -7) and allows helix α2 to pack on top at an angle of ∼124° to helix α1. In the Tcp pilin, helix α2 lies perpendicular to helix α1 (∼90°) and across on the outside of the major β-sheet. Consequently, helix α2, strand β1, and the α1-α2 loop of t-PilS are exposed at the edge of the molecule, whereas only helix α2 is exposed at the same edge in the Tcp pilin (Fig. 3, A and B). Even larger differences between the structures of t-PilS and Tcp pilin are found in the disulfide-bonded D region (19Craig L. Taylor R.K. Pique M.E. Adair B.D. Arvai A.S. Singh M. Lloyd S.J. Shin D.S. Getzoff E.D. Yeager M. Forrest K.T. Tainer J.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1139-1150Google Scholar). The D region of Tcp pilin encompasses 65 residues and is the longest among known Type IVb pilins. The D region of bundle-forming pilus pilin from enteropathogenic E. coli is somewhat shorter, being composed of 49 residues. PilS and pilin of R64 thin pilus have the shortest D regions among Type IVb pilins, consisting of only 36 residues, similar in length to that of the Type IVa pilin of N. gonorrhoeae pilus (29 residues) (Fig. 1). The extra length in the D region of the Tcp pilin is contributed by two extended loops between strands β3 and -4 (24 residues) and between strand β4 and helix α4 (12 residues). These loops contain overlapping epitopes for protective Tcp antibodies and encompass most of the functional domain residues (19Craig L. Taylor R.K. Pique M.E. Adair B.D. Arvai A.S. Singh M. Lloyd S.J. Shin D.S. Getzoff E.D. Yeager M. Forrest K.T. Tainer J.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1139-1150Google Scholar). The corresponding regions in t-PilS, between strands β5 and -6 and between strand β6 and helix α4, are only 2 and 6 residues in length, respectively. The β3-β4 loop in Tcp pilin is highly exposed on the surface of the pilus and covers most of the β-sheet on the opposite side of the N-terminal α-helix (Fig. 3A). In contrast to Tcp pilin, the β5-β6 loop is relatively short in t-PilS; most of the residues on the β-sheet opposite to the N-terminal helix are thus predicted to be exposed on the surface of the pilus. In addition to covering the β-sheet, the β3-β4 loop in Tcp pilin is also extended over the edge of the β-sheet at the D region. To expose functional residues found mainly in the β4-α4 loop and helix α4, the β4-α4 loop is extended and helix α4 packs loosely away from helix α3 and makes an angle of around 50° with the helical axis of the pilus (Fig. 3B). On the contrary, helices α3 and -4 of t-PilS align tightly with each other, and both are almost parallel along the helical axis of the pilus. Model of S. typhi Pilus Assembly—A model of S. typhi pilus was built based on our t-PilS structure and the model of Tcp (19Craig L. Taylor R.K. Pique M.E. Adair B.D. Arvai A.S. Singh M. Lloyd S.J. Shin D.S. Getzoff E.D. Yeager M. Forrest K.T. Tainer J.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1139-1150Google Scholar). The postulated association interface (α2 against α4) between two adjacent t-PilS subunits was energy-refined (total energy = –34.6 kcal/mol) using the program MULTIDOCK (33Jackson R.M. Gabb H.A. Sternberg J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 265-285Google Scholar). The refined dimeric subunit was used to build a single helical strand that was subsequently intertwined with another two identical helical strands to form the pilus model. The model shows that t-PilS can also be arranged into a left-handed three-start helix. Each turn of the helical strand contains six subunits of t-PilS with their α2 helices interacting with the α4 helices of an adjacent subunit in a perpendicular fashion (Fig. 4A). The helix α4 of t-PilS, unlike that of Tcp, is almost parallel to the helical axis of the pilus. Three such helical strands intertwine to form a cylindrical pilus with a helical pitch of around 30 Å and an outer diameter of around 100 Å (Fig. 4B). This arrangement of the pilus places the hydrophobic N-terminal helix (helix α1) of every subunit at the innermost core of the PilS pilus, where it can pack to form a coiled coil providing mechanical strength and stability. In addition to the N-terminal hydrophobic helix, there are polar interfaces buried between stacked subunits of t-PilS from different helical strands. These potential “structural” charged residues at the “tip” side of the molecule are located on the α1-α2 loop (Lys-51), helix α3 (Arg-135), and helix α4 (Glu-157). Those at the “base” side of the molecule are located on the α2-β1 loop (Lys-75), the β4-α3 loop (Lys-120), and the α4-β7 loop (Asp-166 and Arg-169). These charged residues found in both the αβ loop and D region are not exposed but could form salt bridges or side chains to main chain hydrogen bonds to secure the position of neighboring helical strands. In Tcp, these structural charged residues are found within the D region spanning helix α3 to strand β4. In contrast to the above mentioned residues, charged residues found among the interface formed between α2 and -4 of two adjacent subunits or on the β-sheet of each subunit are exposed on the surface of the pilus. These exposed charged residues in the αβ loop are found mainly on the α1-α2 loop (Asp-54), helix α2 (Lys-63 and Asp-66), and the β1-β2 loop (Asp-82). Those found in the D region are mainly located on or around helix α4 (Asp-151, Lys-153, and Glu-162). Asp-103 and Lys-143 are the two exposed charged residues that are found on β3 and -5 of each PilS subunit, respectively (Fig. 5A). All these charged residues are exposed (Fig. 5B) and could be involved in a functional role of the PilS pilus by interacting directly with the first extracellular domain of CFTR. Peptide Binding Surface of the S. typhi Pilus—The first extracellular domain of CFTR (residues 103–117) was identified as a binding receptor on human intestinal cells for S. typhi pilus (4Tsui S.-M.I. Yip M.-C.C. Hackett J. Morris C. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 6049-6050Google Scholar, 5Pier G.B. Grout M. Zaidi T. Meluleni G. Mueschenborn S.S. Banting G. Ratcliff R. Evans M.J. Colledge W.H. Nature. 1998; 393: 79-82Google Scholar). A 10-residue peptide composed of residues 108–117 (SYDPDNKEER) of CFTR was enough to inhibit entry of S. typhi into intestinal cells. This inhibitory effect was not found in another 10-residue peptide composed of residues 103–112 (GRIIASYDPD) of CFTR, indicating that residues 113–117 (NKEER) of CFTR are essential for S. typhi pilus binding (5Pier G.B. Grout M. Zaidi T. Meluleni G. Mueschenborn S.S. Banting G. Ratcliff R. Evans M.J. Colledge W.H. Nature. 1998; 393: 79-82Google Scholar). Interestingly, the same 10-residue peptide was also found to be effective in inhibiting entry of P. aeruginosa into corneal cells (34Zaidi T.S. Lyczak J. Preston M. Pier G.B. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1481-1492Google Scholar). Because the peptide 108–117 of CFTR contains four negatively charged residues and two positively charged residues, the binding site for this peptide on PilS pilus is expected to contain polar or charged residues. Exposed and charged residues in t-PilS are mainly found on or around the helices α2 (Asp-54, Lys-63, Asp-66, and Asp-82) and α4 (Asp-151, Lys-153, and Glu-162) at the interface between two adjacent subunits and also on the exposed β-sheet (Asp-103 and Lys-143) (Fig. 5A). Fig. 5B shows the locations of all the exposed and charged residues found on the surface of PilS pilus. In an attempt to determine the exact binding site of CFTR on PilS, we have synthesized a 10-residue peptide with a sequence derived from residues 108–117 (SYDPDNKEER) of CFTR. The peptide was titrated into a 15N-labeled t-PilS NMR sample, but to our surprise no binding could be observed (data not shown). The inability of t-PilS to bind CFTR is further confirmed by the loss of its ability to inhibit entry of S. typhi into intestinal cells (Fig. 6). Only full-length PilS protein that contains the N-terminal hydrophobic oligomerization domain retained the ability to bind CFTR and inhibit entry of S. typhi into intestinal cells. To identify the exposed charged residues that could involve direct interaction with CFTR, we have generated eight mutants of the full-length PilS protein and tested their abilities to inhibit entry of S. typhi into intestinal cells (Fig. 6). Asp-66 was not tested because the protein tends to precipitate out of solution. Results of the inhibition of bacterial entry experiment show that most of the “functional” charged residues involved in CFTR binding are located on or around helix α4 in the D region (residues Asp-151, Lys-153, and Glu-162). This agrees with the findings on Tcp pilin in which all of its functional residues are found exclusively on or around α4 (19Craig L. Taylor R.K. Pique M.E. Adair B.D. Arvai A.S. Singh M. Lloyd S.J. Shin D.S. Getzoff E.D. Yeager M. Forrest K.T. Tainer J.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1139-1150Google Scholar). Unlike Tcp pilin, the residue on the α1-α2 loop of PilS (Asp-54), which is in close proximity to Lys-153 on helix α4 of an adjacent subunit, is also essential for CFTR binding. Other charged residues that are exposed on the αβ loop (Lys-63 and Asp-82) and the β-sheet (Asp-103 and Lys-143) of PilS are not essential for CFTR binding. Type IV pili plays a crucial role in pathogenesis of many bacterial species by providing adherence to host cells. All Type IV pilins identified to date adopt an αβ roll fold with the N-terminal hydrophobic helix packed against three antiparallel β-strands to form a ladle-shaped molecule. Different classes of Type IV pilins, however, differ substantially in their N-terminal αβ loops and C-terminal disulfide-bonded D regions. Type IVa pilin has either a sugar loop (MS11) or minor β-strands (PAK) in the αβ loop, whereas Type IVb pilin has a well defined α-helix in the αβ loop that is involved in subunit interaction. The disulfide-bonded receptor binding loop in Type IVa pilin is composed of either two type I β-turns joined together (MS11 and K122–4) (14Keizer D.W. Slupsky C.M. Kalisiak M. Campbell A.P. Crump M.P. Sastry P.A. Hazes B. Irvin R.T. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24186-24193Google Scholar) or one type I β-turn joined to a type II β-turn (PAK) (35Campbell A.P. McInnes C. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16255-16268Google Scholar). The corresponding region in Type IVb pilin (Tcp) contains a much more elaborate structure of a pair of α-helices packed on top of a pair of antiparallel β-strands. Here, we have described the structure of the Type IVb pilin from S. typhi, which has an extra pair of β-strands in the αβ loop and much shortened loops in the D region compared with Tcp pilin, the only Type IVb pilin with known structure. Sequence alignment shows that there is only 16% sequence identity between S. typhi PilS and Tcp, whereas there is close to 50% identity between PilS and the Type IVb pilin from R64 thin pilus, which is required for bacterial mating (Fig. 1) (10Kim S.-R. Komano T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3594-3603Google Scholar). We propose to classify the Type IVb pilin from S. typhi and R64 plasmid as a distinct subclass of Type IVb pilin having significantly shortened loops in the D region from those in Tcp and bundle-forming pilus. Differences between the αβ loop and D region of the two subclasses of Type IVb pilins affected not just the assembly of the pili but also the availability of exposed residues in the vicinity of the D region for receptor binding. Although the structures of both Type IVb pilins belong to the same αβ roll class as Type IVa pilins, the addition of extra α-helices at both ends of the β-sheet in Type IVb pilin generates a unique pattern of pilus assembly. Type IVa pilin forms either a right-handed (MS11 and PAK) or left-handed (K122–4) 1-start helix with five subunits/helical turn. The N-terminal α-helices interacting with each other at the middle of the pilus form a coiled coil structure, whereas the interface between adjacent subunits is formed by continuous β-strand hydrogen bonding. The Type IVa pilus is relatively thin and fragile with a helical pitch of around 40 Å and a diameter of around 50 Å (K122–4). Type IVb pilin, such as Tcp, adopts a left-handed three-start helix of six subunits/turn with α2 from the αβ loop of one subunit interacting with α4 from the D region of an adjacent subunit. The Type IVb pilus is relatively thick and sturdy with a helical pitch of 45 Å and a diameter of 80 Å (Tcp). The proposed model shows that S. typhi PilS can also be assembled into a left-handed three-start helix with six subunits/helical strand. Despite the difference in the orientation of α4 relative to the helical axis, the helical pitch (30 Å) and diameter (100 Å) of the PilS pilus model are comparable with those, 37.5 and 100 Å, respectively, obtained for the crystallo-graphic fibers of N-terminal-truncated Tcp. The helical pitch and diameter of the PilS model, however, differ from the intact Tcp filaments, which have a 45-Å pitch and a diameter of ∼80 Å (19Craig L. Taylor R.K. Pique M.E. Adair B.D. Arvai A.S. Singh M. Lloyd S.J. Shin D.S. Getzoff E.D. Yeager M. Forrest K.T. Tainer J.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1139-1150Google Scholar). Addition of extra pulling forces from the N-terminal helices is expected to increase the helical pitch and reduce the diameter of the intact S. typhi pilus. This speculation also agrees with the measured diameter of intact S. typhi pilus by electron microscopy, which is around 6–8 nm (data not shown). CFTR has long been recognized as the cellular receptor for S. typhi entry. Human cells expressing wild-type CFTR ingested significantly more S. typi than cells expressing ΔF508 CFTR (5Pier G.B. Grout M. Zaidi T. Meluleni G. Mueschenborn S.S. Banting G. Ratcliff R. Evans M.J. Colledge W.H. Nature. 1998; 393: 79-82Google Scholar). This entry can be inhibited either with a peptide derived from the first extracellular domain of CFTR (5Pier G.B. Grout M. Zaidi T. Meluleni G. Mueschenborn S.S. Banting G. Ratcliff R. Evans M.J. Colledge W.H. Nature. 1998; 393: 79-82Google Scholar) or with soluble recombinant protein of PilS (3Zhang X.-L. Tsui S.-M.I. Yip M.-C.C. Fung W.-Y.A. Wong K.-H.D. Dai X.-Y. Yang Y.-H. Hackett J. Morris C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3067-3073Google Scholar). The CFTR peptide, but not a scrambled one, can effectively neutralize the cell entry inhibition afforded by the PilS protein and vice versa (4Tsui S.-M.I. Yip M.-C.C. Hackett J. Morris C. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 6049-6050Google Scholar). Because the proposed receptor of PilS on CFTR carry mostly charged residues, we have generated mutants for most of the exposed and charged residues on PilS according to the model to pinpoint its receptor binding site. Based on data from inhibition of bacterial entry by full-length PilS protein, the binding site for CFTR on PilS pilus might be at the interface between adjacent subunits with charged residues not only from the D region but also from the αβ loop. Depending on the conformation of the bound CFTR peptide, the binding site could be between adjacent subunits on the same helical strand or even between subunits on different helical strands (Fig. 5B). In Tcp, functional charged residues that extend outward to the surface of the Tcp filament for interaction with other pili, bacteriophage, or host cells are found exclusively on or adjacent to helix α4 in the D region (19Craig L. Taylor R.K. Pique M.E. Adair B.D. Arvai A.S. Singh M. Lloyd S.J. Shin D.S. Getzoff E.D. Yeager M. Forrest K.T. Tainer J.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1139-1150Google Scholar). This finding also explains why the monomeric t-PilS is unable to bind CFTR, because the complete binding site could be comprised of charged residues from different subunits. CFTR binding is strictly dependent on the assembly of PilS pilin into pilus and might be for improved specificity and cooperativity of binding. This is the first report on structural study of PilS from S. typhi. Identification of the structure of t-PilS and its pattern of pilus assembly, as well as candidate residues that are essential for receptor binding, not only provides the basis for other structural studies but also opens the possibility of rational drug or vaccine design against this adhesin that is commonly used by S. typhi for host invasion.

https://openalex.org/W2048889577,"All three human glycoprotein hormone heterodimers are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum by threading the glycosylated end of α-subunit loop two (α2) beneath a disulfide “latched” strand of the β-subunit known as the “seatbelt.” This remarkable event occurs efficiently even though the seatbelt effectively blocks the reverse process, thereby stabilizing each heterodimer. Studies described here show that assembly is facilitated by the formation, disruption, and reformation of a loop within the seatbelt that is stabilized by the most easily reduced disulfide in the free β-subunit. We refer to this disulfide as the “tensor” because it shortens the seatbelt, thereby securing the heterodimer. Formation of the tensor disulfide appears to precede and facilitate seatbelt latching in most human choriogonadotropin β-subunit molecules. Subsequent disruption of the tensor disulfide elongates the seatbelt, thereby increasing the space beneath the seatbelt and the β-subunit core. This permits the formation of hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms of the β-subunit cystine knot and the tensor loop with backbone atoms in loop α2, a process that causes the glycosylated end of loop α2tobe threaded between the seatbelt and the β-subunit core. Contacts between the tensor loop and loop α2 promote reformation of the tensor disulfide, which explains why it is more stable in the heterodimer than in the uncombined β-subunit. These findings unravel the puzzling nature of how a threading mechanism can be used in the endoplasmic reticulum to assemble glycoprotein hormones that have essential roles in vertebrate reproduction and thyroid function.

These findings unravel the puzzling nature of how a threading mechanism can be used in the endoplasmic reticulum to assemble glycoprotein hormones that have essential roles in vertebrate reproduction and thyroid function. The glycoprotein hormones are heterodimers of two cystine knot proteins (1Lapthorn A.J. Harris D.C. Littlejohn A. Lustbader J.W. Canfield R.E. Machin K.J. Morgan F.J. Isaacs N.W.

This topology raises questions as to how these heterodimers might be assembled. We have found that the human glycoprotein hormone subunits combine by a process in which the glycosylated end of loop α2 is threaded beneath the seatbelt while it is latched (22Xing Y. Myers R.V. Cao D. Lin W. Jiang M. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35426-35436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although the hCG heterodimer can be assembled by a mechanism in which the seatbelt is wrapped around loop α2 after the subunits dock (4Ruddon R.W. Sherman S.A. Bedows E. Protein Sci. 1996; 8: 1443-1452Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 5Xing Y. Lin W. Jiang M. Myers R.V. Cao D. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46953-46960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), this appears to be a minor pathway that can be used to form some hormone analogs that are unable to latch their seatbelts to β-subunit loop 1. This “salvage” pathway may have had a role in the evolution of glycoprotein hormones in some teleost fish (23Xing Y. Myers R.V. Cao D. Lin W. Jiang M. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35449-35457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Purified glycoprotein hormone subunits have long been known to recombine slowly in vitro in oxidizing conditions (6Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar), a phenomenon that occurs while all the disulfides in both subunits remain intact (7Xing Y. Williams C. Campbell R.K. Cook S. Knoppers M. Addona T. Altarocca V. Moyle W.R. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This showed that assembly can occur by a mechanism in which the glycosylated end of loop α2 is threaded beneath the seatbelt. hCG assembly is accelerated substantially by protein-disulfide isomerase (8Huth J.R. Perini F. Lockridge O. Bedows E. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16472-16482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and low concentrations of reducing agents, however (7Xing Y. Williams C. Campbell R.K. Cook S. Knoppers M. Addona T. Altarocca V. Moyle W.R. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore, β-mercaptoethanol-catalyzed assembly is blocked by agents that react with thiols, e.g. iodoacetate (7Xing Y. Williams C. Campbell R.K. Cook S. Knoppers M. Addona T. Altarocca V. Moyle W.R. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), an indication that threading is limited by one or more disulfide bonds that must reform for the heterodimer to be stable after assembly is completed. Using a highly sensitive procedure capable of detecting and identifying trace amounts of free thiols, we found that only one of the 11 hCG disulfides was disrupted significantly during β-mercaptoethanol-catalyzed assembly (7Xing Y. Williams C. Campbell R.K. Cook S. Knoppers M. Addona T. Altarocca V. Moyle W.R. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because this disulfide stabilizes a small loop in the β-subunit seatbelt, this finding implies that reduction of this disulfide enhanced subunit combination in vitro by elongating the seatbelt. This would increase the size of the hole in the β-subunit, thereby facilitating the passage of the glycosylated end of loop α2. Whereas these studies showed how β-mercaptoethanol facilitated threading, because the reverse process must be inhibited to stabilize the heterodimer, it remained unclear as to why β-mercaptoethanol did not facilitate heterodimer dissociation. Studies of hCG assembly in cells using pulse-chase methods (4Ruddon R.W. Sherman S.A. Bedows E. Protein Sci. 1996; 8: 1443-1452Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar) indicated that the disulfide that stabilizes the small seatbelt loop forms before the disulfide that latches the seatbelt to loop β1 (4Ruddon R.W. Sherman S.A. Bedows E. Protein Sci. 1996; 8: 1443-1452Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Based on our observations that most hCG is assembled while the seatbelt remains latched (22Xing Y. Myers R.V. Cao D. Lin W. Jiang M. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35426-35436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and that this is impeded in vitro by the small loop in the seatbelt (7Xing Y. Williams C. Campbell R.K. Cook S. Knoppers M. Addona T. Altarocca V. Moyle W.R. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the small seatbelt loop might break and reform during heterodimer assembly in the ER. Because of the transient nature of this process, we expected that formation, disruption, and reformation of this disulfide would not be detected using pulse-chase methods. To study this process in cells, we took advantage of an hCG antibody that can distinguish β-subunit isoforms in which the seatbelt is latched normally from those in which it is latched to alternate sites. By observing how free cysteines in the α- and β-subunits influence seatbelt latching and hormone assembly, we found that formation, disruption, and reformation of the disulfide that stabilizes the small seatbelt loop is critical for efficient heterodimer assembly in cells. Because this disulfide stabilizes the small loop that shortens the seatbelt, we refer to it as the “tensor.” As shown here, the tensor disulfide appears to function as a redox-regulated switch. Formation of the tensor disulfide facilitates latching of the end of the seatbelt to the β-subunit core. Disruption of the tensor disulfide after the seatbelt has been latched facilitates threading. Reformation of the tensor disulfide after the glycosylated end of loop α2 has been threaded beneath the seatbelt completes assembly and stabilizes the heterodimer. The sources of reagents and methods of analyses used in these studies are described in the preceding manuscript (22Xing Y. Myers R.V. Cao D. Lin W. Jiang M. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35426-35436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Constructs used in this study (Fig. 1), which were produced by standard polymerase chain reaction and cassette mutagenesis methods (9Campbell R.K. Dean Emig D.M. Moyle W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) were sequenced prior to use. The name of each construct used in these studies reflects its amino acid sequence. For example, hCGβ-C93A refers to an hCG β-subunit analog in which βCys93 is converted to alanine. Because βCys93 forms a disulfide in the heterodimer with βCys100, converting βCys93 to alanine leaves βCys100 unpaired, making it available to form a disulfide with nearby cysteines. During these studies we prepared several hCG analogs and monitored them using well characterized monoclonal antibodies. The relative locations of the mutations and the antibody binding sites in the free β-subunit and in the heterodimer are summarized in Figs. 2 and 3. The rationale for each of the studies is described in the text and figure legends.Fig. 2Rationale for determining the influence of the tensor disulfide on formation of the seatbelt latch disulfide. A cysteine was introduced into the hCG β-subunit coding sequence either by changing the codons for either βCys93 or βCys100 to that for alanine (top panel) or by changing a codon for a residue in another part of the β-subunit to that for cysteine (bottom panel). Constructs were expressed individually in COS-7 cells and β-subunit analogs that were secreted or retained in the cells (KDEL constructs only) were measured in a sandwich immunoassay using B101 for capture and 125I-B110 for detection relative to a purified hCG β-subunit standard. B110 binding provided an estimate of the total amount of β-subunit that had well folded β-core. It did not provide an indication of how the seatbelt was latched, however. Measurement of seatbelt latch formation was made using B101 for capture and 125I-B111 for detection relative to the same hCG β-subunit standard. The ability of the β-subunit analogs to bind B111 relative to B110 provided an estimate of the fraction of the material in which the seatbelt is latched to βCys26, its normal site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Stereo view depicting the locations of the amino acids used to create the data inTable I. Coordinates for the Cα atoms of the β-subunit derived from the crystal structure of hCG (1Lapthorn A.J. Harris D.C. Littlejohn A. Lustbader J.W. Canfield R.E. Machin K.J. Morgan F.J. Isaacs N.W.

The Cα atoms of the residues discussed in the text are shown space-filled and numbered. The relative binding sites of the antibodies used for measurement are also indicated. Note that the tensor disulfide is formed by residues Cys93-Cys100 and the seatbelt latch disulfide is normally formed by residues Cys26-Cys110. The seatbelt extends from residues Ala91 to Cys110. It is unlikely that the positions of β-subunit loop 2 (top of the figure) or the seatbelt occupy the same positions in the free β-subunit as they do in the heterodimer. Because the structure of the uncombined β-subunit is not known, this figure has been derived from the heterodimer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Tensor Loop Is Usually Formed Before the Seatbelt Is Latched—Most hCG is assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum by a threading mechanism in which α2 passes beneath the seatbelt through a hole in the β-subunit (22Xing Y.

We had found that subunit combination was facilitated in vitro when the tensor disulfide (i.e. β93-β100) was disrupted (7Xing Y. Williams C. Campbell R.K. Cook S. Knoppers M. Addona T. Altarocca V. Moyle W.R. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and considered the possibility that this disulfide forms in the endoplasmic reticulum only after the heterodimer is assembled. Pulse-chase analyses (4Ruddon R.W. Sherman S.A. Bedows E. Protein Sci. 1996; 8: 1443-1452Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar) suggested that the tensor disulfide forms before the seatbelt latch disulfide (i.e. β110-β26). Because the seatbelt is latched prior to hCG assembly (22Xing Y. Myers R.V. Cao D. Lin W. Jiang M. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35426-35436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), this implies that the tensor loop forms before the subunits dock, a phenomenon that would retard threading (7Xing Y. Williams C. Campbell R.K. Cook S. Knoppers M. Addona T. Altarocca V. Moyle W.R. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Using the rationale outlined in Fig. 2, we re-examined the order in which the tensor and seatbelt latch disulfides are formed by comparing the abilities of β-subunit analogs lacking one or both tensor cysteines to latch their seatbelts to βCys26. Initial studies were designed to learn if the seatbelt would become latched in hCG β-subunit analogs that lacked the ability to form the tensor loop (Fig. 2, upper panel). To be certain that passage of the β-subunit through the secretory pathway did not influence our results, we conducted these studies using hCG β-subunit analogs that are secreted as well as those that are retained within the cell because of the presence of an ER retention signal at their carboxyl terminus (i.e. KDEL) (10Munro S. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). We have found that this signal delays heterodimer secretion (22Xing Y. Myers R.V. Cao D. Lin W. Jiang M. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35426-35436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), presumably by keeping the β-subunit in the ER. To deduce the relative timing of seatbelt latching and tensor loop formation, we studied how adding or removing β-subunit cysteines influenced seatbelt latch formation in the free β-subunit. In these studies we quantified the total amount of β-subunit with a sandwich immunoassay using monoclonal antibodies B101 for capture and 125I-B110 for detection (Fig. 3). This assay detects those molecules that have formed the β-subunit core, i.e. the portion of the molecule created by the formation of the cystine knot. We monitored the fraction of the total heterodimer in which the seatbelt was latched to βCys26 using a sandwich assay employing monoclonal antibodies B101 for capture and 125I-B111 for detection (Fig. 3). B111 does not recognize the hCG β-subunit when the seatbelt is latched to cysteines that are added to other sites in the β-subunit. As described next, using this property of B111, we determined that formation of the tensor disulfide usually occurs prior to formation of the seatbelt latch disulfide. hCG β-subunit analogs lacking both tensor cysteines latched their seatbelts to βCys26, a finding that showed that the tensor disulfide does not need to form for the seatbelt to be latched properly (Table I, rows 1 and 2). For example, B111 recognized β-subunit analogs hCGβ-C93A,C100A and hCG-C93A,C100A-KDEL, which lack cysteines βCys93 and βCys100 (Table I, rows 1 and 2, column C93A and C100A), as well as or better than hCGβ and hCGβ-KDEL, which contain both tensor cysteines (Table I, rows 1 and 2, column C93 and C100). This observation does not mean that the seatbelt is latched before the tensor disulfide in most β-subunit molecules, however. As described next, other data suggested that the tensor disulfide usually forms first.Table ICompetition of β-subunit cysteines with βCys26 for seatbelt residue βCys110 and influence of the tensor disulfideData rowhCGβ analogDistance to βCys90Binding to B111 Relative to B110Cys93 and Cys100C93A and C100AÅratio ± S.E.1hCGβ28aThere are no free cysteines in the hCG β-subunit and the distance illustrated is that between βCys90 and βCys26.1.16 ± 0.021.83 ± 0.162hCGβ-KDEL28aThere are no free cysteines in the hCG β-subunit and the distance illustrated is that between βCys90 and βCys26.0.86 ± 0.011.29 ± 0.133hCGβ-C93A80.25 ± 0.014hCGβ-C93A-KDEL80.42 ± 0.075hCGβ-C100A130.14 ± 0.026hCGβ-C100A-KDEL130.24 ± 0.057hCGβ-R8C91.15 ± 0.090.78 ± 0.158hCGβ-L16C220.16 ± 0.02Not Done9hCGβ-E21C-KDEL310.63 ± 0.100.42 ± 0.1010hCGβ-I33C130.16 ± 0.010.05 ± 0.0011hCGβ-A35C100.44 ± 0.030.14 ± 0.0112hCGβ-A35C-KDEL100.29 ± 0.050.16 ± 0.0113hCGβ-F64C210.31 ± 0.06Not Done14hCGβ-F64C-KDEL210.46 ± 0.010.51 ± 0.0715hCGβ-N77C360.83 ± 0.14Not Done16hCGβ-N77C-KDEL360.47 ± 0.010.25 ± 0.0317hCGβ-A83C180.37 ± 0.09Not Done18hCGβ-A83C-KDEL180.28 ± 0.010.53 ± 0.0319hCGβ-A91C40.41 ± 0.08Not Done20hCGβ-S96C170.21 ± 0.02Not Donea There are no free cysteines in the hCG β-subunit and the distance illustrated is that between βCys90 and βCys26. Open table in a new tab To determine whether a tensor cysteine might serve as a potential seatbelt latch site, we replaced one tensor cysteine with alanine and compared the abilities of B110 and B111 to detect the resulting β-subunits. Analogs containing only a single tensor cysteine recognized B110 much better than B111, showing that the seatbelt was not latched to βCys26 in a majority of these β-subunits. For example, only 25, 42, 14, and 24% of hCG-βC93A, hCGβ-C93A-KDEL, hCGβ-C100A, and hCGβ-C100A-KDEL subunits appeared to have their seatbelts latched to βCys26 as reflected by differences in their abilities to be recognized by B110 and B111 (Table I, row 3–6). The loss in B111 binding relative to that of B110 caused by elimination of one tensor cysteine appeared because of the competition of the remaining tensor cysteine with βCys26 for formation of the seatbelt latch disulfide, not to a change in folding of the remainder of the β-subunit. This is because changes in other parts of the β-subunit would have disrupted the binding of antibodies B101 and B110 to the β-subunit core. The finding that the seatbelt was not latched properly in most β-subunit molecules that contain only a single tensor cysteine (Table I, rows 3–6) is in marked contrast to the finding that the seatbelt was latched properly when both tensor cysteines were present or when both tensor cysteines were missing (Table I, rows 1 and 2). This suggests that the tensor cysteines have the potential to become latched transiently to the seatbelt before the seatbelt is latched and, as discussed next, supports the notion that the tensor disulfide is usually formed before the seatbelt is latched. Residues βCys93, βCys100, and βCys110 are located near one another in the seatbelt. Therefore, before the seatbelt is latched, βCys110 is likely to be nearer tensor cysteines βCys93 and βCys100 than it is to βCys26, the cysteine in loop β1 with which it will ultimately form the seatbelt latch disulfide. Consequently, βCys110 may compete with βCys93 and βCys100 for formation of the tensor disulfide. In analogs lacking both tensor cysteines, the seatbelt has no latch site other than βCys26, 2Alternatively, one could argue that seatbelt residue βCys110 forms a disulfide with the other cysteines in the β-subunit such as βCys23, βCys72, or one of those present in the cystine knot. These explanations seem unlikely, however, because the resulting analogs would not be detected using B110. The β-subunit does not form in the absence of a cystine knot cysteine (11Suganuma N. Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19302-19307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is not detected by B110 when βCys23 or βCys72 is absent (W. R. Moyle, unpublished data). Furthermore, βCys23 and βCys72 are further than βCys26 from seatbelt residue βCys110, making them less likely to serve as seatbelt latch sites. which would account for the finding that it appeared to be latched exclusively to this cysteine (Table I, data rows 1 and 2). In contrast, when one of the tensor disulfides is eliminated, βCys110 has two potential latch sites, i.e. βCys26 and either βCys93 or βCys100. The finding that the seatbelt was latched to βCys26 in only a fraction of the β-subunit molecules that contained a single tensor cysteine suggests that βCys110 has little intrinsic tendency to be latched to βCys26. Its proximity to βCys93 and βCys100 makes it more likely to form a stable disulfide with either of these tensor cysteines unless it is prevented from doing so. What prevents the seatbelt from becoming latched stably to a tensor cysteine when both cysteines are present? The most likely explanation is that the tensor disulfide forms first or is more stable than either the βCys110-βCys93 and βCys110-βCys100 disulfides. Physical constraints on the positions of the latter disulfides cause them to remain near βCys100 or βCys93, which would enable them to be disrupted by a disulfide exchange involving βCys100 or βCys93, respectively. This would form the tensor disulfide and enable βCys110 to form the seatbelt latch disulfide with βCys26. An exchange of this type cannot occur in β-subunit analogs that have only one tensor cysteine, which would account for the reduction in abilities of hCGβ-C100A and hCGβ-C93A to latch their seatbelts to βCys26 (Table I, data rows 3–6). The probability that βCys110 forms a disulfide with βCys26 before it forms a disulfide with βCys93 or βCys100 can be estimated from the fraction of hCGβ-C100A and hCGβ-C93A that is recognized by B111, respectively (Table I). Whereas βCys110 would also be capable of disrupting a disulfide between βCys93 and βCys100, it would be less likely to do so because its location at the end of the seatbelt does not constrain it to an area near the tensor disulfide. Thus, the findings that seatbelt latch disulfide formation is impaired by eliminating either βCys93 or βCys100, but not by eliminating both cysteines, suggest that the tensor disulfide forms before the seatbelt is latched in most β-subunit molecules. The finding that removal of one tensor cysteine prevented the hCG seatbelt from being latched properly in a majority of β-subunit molecules suggested that βCys110 at the end of the seatbelt is not constrained to a region near βCys26. We tested the possibility that βCys110 scans the β-subunit to find its normal latch site by monitoring the abilities of cysteines added to the β-subunit to compete with βCys26 for formation of the seatbelt latch disulfide. The rationale for this is described in the lower panel of Fig. 2. Several cysteines were found to compete with βCys26 for formation of the seatbelt latch site. These included those in place of βLeu16, βIle33, βAla35, βPhe64, βAla83, βAla91, and βSer96 (Table I). For example, the presence of a cysteine in place of βLeu16 caused a 6-fold loss in the ability of the β-subunit to be recognized by B111 relative to B110, indicating that the seatbelt was latched to βCys26 in only one of six β-subunit molecules (i.e. 16% of the β-subunit). Similar results were found when the seatbelt had a choice between βCys26 and a cysteine in place of βIle33. Some cysteine substitutions had relatively little influence on seatbelt latching. Thus, replacing βArg8 or βAsn77 with cysteine was accompanied by a smaller reduction in the abilities of the β-subunit to be recognized by B111 (Table I). With the exception of the cysteine in place of βArg8, most cysteines competed with βCys26 for latching the seatbelt. Consequently, addition of cysteine to most sites in loops β1 and β3 reduced the ability of the β-subunit to be recognized by B111. Cysteines that were closer to the origin of the seatbelt (i.e. βAla91) were usually more efficient competitors. 3Conceivably, residues added to the β-subunit could form an intrasubunit disulfide with one of the tensor cysteines. The resulting “loss” of a tensor cysteine would permit the seatbelt to be latched to the other tensor cysteine. While we are unable to distinguish this possibility per se, it seems unlikely because the tensor cysteines are much closer to one another than to any of the other cysteines in the β-subunit with the possible exception of some cysteines in the cystine knot. Furthermore, the formation of such a disulfide would not occur unless the seatbelt were sufficiently mobile that it could form a disulfide with other parts of the β-subunit. This would also suggest that the mobility of the seatbelt enables it to scan the surface of the β-subunit until it encounters a cysteine with which it can form a disulfide. These observations support the notion that the hCG seatbelt does not have a strict propensity to be latched to βCys26. These studies supported the notion that βCys110 “scans” the surface of the β-subunit by a constrained random walk to find βCys26, its natural cysteine “partner.” By shortening the length of the seatbelt, formation of the tensor disulfide would restrict the surface of the β-subunit that can be scanned, making it easier for βCys110 to find βCys26. To test this notion, we repeated many of these studies with an hCG β-subunit analog that was unable to form the tensor disulfide. As can be seen (Table I), the ability to form the tensor disulfide influenced the abilities of cysteines to compete with βCys26. As a result, when the tensor disulfide was removed, there was a significant reduction in B111 binding. This indicated that the seatbelt had a greater tendency to be latched to the cysteine added to the β-subunit and a lower tendency to be latched to βCys26. In only one case (i.e. hCGβ-A83C) was the abilities of the seatbelt to be latched to βCys26 increased when the tensor disulfide was removed. These observations are also consistent with the notion that the tensor disulfide is formed before the seatbelt is latched in most hCG β-subunit molecules. The Tensor Loop Disulfide Appears to Be Disrupted Transiently during Assembly of Heterodimers by the Threading Pathway—Pulse-chase analyses (4Ruddon R.W. Sherman S.A. Bedows E. Protein Sci. 1996; 8: 1443-1452Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and the data just presented indicate that the tensor loop is formed before the seatbelt is latched in most hCG β-subunit molecules. Because the hCG seatbelt is usually latched prior to heterodimer assembly (22Xing Y. Myers R.V. Cao D. Lin W. Jiang M. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35426-35436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we expect that the tensor disulfide would also be present prior to heterodimer assembly, at least transiently. Studies using purified hCG α- and β-subunits showed that disruption of the tensor disulfide facilitated assembly in vitro (7Xing Y. Williams C. Campbell R.K. Cook S. Knoppers M. Addona T. Altarocca V. Moyle W.R. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and we considered the possibility that the tensor disulfide might also be disrupted during assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum. A clue to the manner in which we might identify free tensor cysteines during threading came from the observation that a fraction of some heterodimers having an additional cysteine in their α-subunits were acid stable (22Xing Y. Myers R.V. Cao D. Lin W. Jiang M. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35426-35"
https://openalex.org/W2086379196,"Vertebrate glycoprotein hormone heterodimers are stabilized by a strand of their β-subunits known as the “seatbelt” that is wrapped around loop 2 of their α-subunits (α2). The cysteine that terminates the seatbelt is “latched” by a disulfide to a cysteine in β-subunit loop 1 (β1) of all vertebrate hormones except some teleost follitropins (teFSH), wherein it is latched to a cysteine in the β-subunit NH2 terminus. As reported here, teFSH analogs of human choriogonadotropin (hCG) are assembled by a pathway in which the subunits dock before the seatbelt is latched; assembly is completed by wrapping the seatbelt around loop α2 and latching it to the NH2 terminus. This differs from hCG assembly, which occurs by threading the glycosylated end of loop α2 beneath the latched seatbelt through a hole in the β-subunit. The seatbelt is the part of the β-subunit that has the greatest influence on biological function. Changes in its sequence during the divergence of lutropins, follitropins, and thyrotropins and the speciation of teleost fish may have impeded heterodimer assembly by a threading mechanism, as observed when the hCG seatbelt was replaced with its salmon FSH counterpart. Whereas wrapping is less efficient than threading, it may have facilitated natural experimentation with the composition of the seatbelt during the co-evolution of glycoprotein hormones and their receptors. Migration of the seatbelt latch site to the NH2-terminal end of the β-subunit would have facilitated teFSH assembly by a wraparound mechanism and may have contributed also to its ability to distinguish lutropin and follitropin receptors.

The glycoprotein hormones have key roles in reproduction and thyroid function (1Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar). These heterodimers have an unusual topology in which a strand of their β-subunits surrounds a loop of their α-subunits (2Lapthorn A.J. Harris D.C. Littlejohn A. Lustbader J.W. Canfield R.E.

In addition to its role in stabilizing the heterodimer, the seatbelt is responsible for much of the influence of the β-subunit on human glycoprotein hormone activity (5Campbell R.K. Dean Emig D.M.

The structures of the analogs used in this work can be determined by reference to Fig. 2. of some teleost fish. Whereas in most species the seatbelt is latched to a cysteine in loop β1, in many teleosts it is latched to a cysteine in the NH2-terminal end of the β-subunit corresponding to hCG residue βLeu5 (10Garcia-Hernandez M.P. Koide Y. Diaz M.V. Kawauchi H. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1997; 106: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This reduces the size of the hole in the β-subunit through which loop α2 is straddled (Fig. 1). The smaller size of this space in teFSH would be expected to impede threading of the glycosylated end of loop α2 through the β-subunit, a phenomenon that explains the greater acid stability of the teFSH heterodimer (10Garcia-Hernandez M.P.

The latter dissociate completely within 15–20 min at pH 2, 37 °C (12Aloj S.M. Edelhock H. Ingham K.C. Morgan F.J. Canfield R.E. Ross G.T. Arch. Biochem.

The human glycoprotein hormones hCG, hFSH, and hTSH are assembled in mammalian cells primarily by a process in which loop α2 and its attached oligosaccharide are threaded through a hole in the β-subunit. This hole is formed after the seatbelt is latched to loop β1 (19Xing Y. Myers R.V. Cao D. Lin W. Jiang M. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol.

The smaller space available for passage of loop α2 beneath the teFSH seatbelt suggested that teFSH might be assembled by a mechanism in which the subunits dock before the seatbelt is latched. This would enable the seatbelt to be wrapped around loop α2 before it is latched to a cysteine in the β-subunit NH2 terminus. Experiments described here were designed to learn how teFSH analogs of hCG are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum and to identify factors that contribute to the use of the threading and wraparound pathways for glycoprotein hormone assembly. Because the topology of teFSH differs substantially from that of hCG, we anticipated these studies would also enable us to test our procedures for analyzing hormone assembly in living cells (19Xing Y.

By studying the assembly of a series of salmon FSH-hCG chimeras that are readily monitored using antibodies to hCG, we found that hCG analogs having the teFSH fold cannot be assembled by a threading mechanism and, as a consequence, are formed by a wraparound mechanism. Forcing the seatbelt to be latched to a site in the NH2 terminus enhanced the assembly of teFSH analogs, most likely by reducing the inherent tendency of the seatbelt to be latched before the subunits dock. The α- and β-subunit analogs used in these studies are illustrated in Fig. 2. Chimeras of salmon FSH and hCG β-subunits are identified using the root term s/hCGβ. For example, s/hCGβ-Nt,SB,C26A is an hCG β-subunit analog that contains the salmon FSH NH2 terminus and seatbelt and an alanine in place of βCys26. All other reagents and methods used in these studies have been described in the preceding accompanying articles (19Xing Y. Myers R.V. Cao D. Lin W. Jiang M. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35426-35436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Xing Y. Myers R.V. Cao D. Lin W. Jiang M. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol.

Some Heterodimers Containing β-Subunits That Are Chimeras of Salmon FSH and hCG Are Assembled Differently from hCG—To study the assembly of heterodimers that have the teFSH folding pattern, we employed an hCG β-subunit analog that contained the salmon FSH β-subunit NH2 terminus and seatbelt. This β-subunit chimera, s/hCGβ-Nt,SB,C26A (Fig. 2), retained binding sites for most hCG monoclonal antibodies that recognize epitopes formed by the subunit core, which includes its cystine knot and loops β1, β2, and β3. Because this analog contains an alanine in place of βCys26, the normal hCG β-subunit seatbelt latch site, it was expected to latch its seatbelt to βCys5, a cysteine within its NH2-terminal salmon sequence. This β-subunit chimera was incorporated into heterodimers that contained the native human α-subunit, but much less efficiently than hCGβ (Table I, data rows 1 and 7). Unlike the hCG heterodimer, which dissociated completely at pH 2 within 30 min at 37 °C, only about 20% of the hCG/teFSH chimera heterodimer dissociated under these conditions. It was not as stable as heterodimers that contain an intersubunit disulfide, which do not dissociate under these conditions (13Xing Y. Lin W. Jiang M. Myers R.V. Cao D. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46953-46960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These observations showed that we could distinguish heterodimers in which the seatbelt is latched to the α-subunit, heterodimers in which the seatbelt is latched to βCys5, and heterodimers in which the seatbelt is latched to βCys26 by measuring differences in their stabilities at pH 2, 37 °C. These differences become much more apparent following an overnight treatment at pH 2, 37 °C (Fig. 3).Table IRelative influence of the β1 and N-terminal latch sites on heterodimer assemblyData rowAnalog transfectedTotal dimeraHeterodimer secreted into the culture medium was determined in A113/125I-B110 sandwich assays.Dimer detected by B111bLatching of the seatbelt to β1 was determined in A113/125I-B111 sandwich assays.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Variation in heterodimer stability as a function of the seatbelt latch site. The acid stabilities of heterodimers in which the seatbelt is latched to βCys26 (i.e. hCG), βCys5 (i.e. α+s/hCGβ-L5C,SB,C26A), and α-subunit residue αCys41 (i.e. α-L41C+hCGβ-C26A) were determined at pH 2, 37 °C. The heterodimer containing the native hCG β-subunit dissociated completely within 30 min. That in which the seatbelt is latched to the α-subunit did not dissociate during an overnight incubation. The heterodimer in which the seatbelt was latched to βCys5 had a half-life of ∼5–6 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The hCGβ and s/hCGβ-Nt,SB,C26A subunits differ in their NH2-terminal ends, their seatbelts, and in loop β1. Studies described next were designed to learn how each of these regions influence heterodimer assembly. Replacing hCG β-subunit residue βLeu5 with cysteine created hCGβ-L5C, an hCG analog that has a seatbelt latch site in an NH2-terminal location corresponding to that in salmon FSH. Heterodimers that contained the native human α-subunit and hCGβ-L5C dissociated rapidly at pH 2, 37 °C, and were recognized by B111 (Table I, row 2), indicating that their seatbelts were latched to βCys26 in loop β1, not to βCys5. Thus, introduction of a potential latch site into the hCGβ NH2 terminus was not sufficient to alter the manner in which the heterodimer is assembled. In contrast, elimination of the seatbelt latch site in loop β1 of hCGβ-L5C reduced its ability to form heterodimers with the native human α-subunit as can be seen by the lack of heterodimer formed when the α-subunit was co-expressed with hCGβ-L5C,C26A (Table I, row 3). This finding is consistent with the notion that the hCG seatbelt of hCGβ-L5C,C26A became latched to βCys5 prior to subunit docking and/or that the seatbelt did not become latched to βCys5 after the subunits had docked. The propensity of the hCG seatbelt to be latched prior to subunit docking (19Xing Y. Myers R.V. Cao D. Lin W. Jiang M. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35426-35436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) suggests that it may have become latched to this site prior to the start of assembly. This would indicate that it can interfere with threading when latched to a cysteine in the NH2 terminus. To learn how the salmon FSHβ NH2 terminus affected assembly, we expressed s/hCGβ-Nt and s/hCGβ-Nt,C26A with the native human α-subunit (Table I, rows 4 and 5). The presence of the salmon FSHβ NH2 terminus appeared not to affect most heterodimer assembly. Consequently, 90% of the heterodimers containing s/hCGβ-Nt dissociated within 30 min at pH 2, 37 °C, and were readily recognized by antibody B111 (Table I, row 4). The latter observation showed that their seatbelts were latched to βCys26 in loop β1. The remaining 10% survived pH 2 treatment, 37 °C for 30 min, however, indicating that their seatbelts were latched to βCys5 in the salmon FSHβ NH2 terminus. Preventing s/hCGβ-Nt from latching its seatbelt to loop β1 by converting βCys26 to alanine inhibited heterodimer assembly as seen by the lack of incorporation of s/hCGβ-Nt,C26A into heterodimers (Table I, row 5). Considered together, these observations suggested that the hCG seatbelt present in either s/hCGβ-Nt or s/hCGβ-Nt,C26A can become latched to βCys5 in the salmon FSH NH2 terminus before or after the subunits dock; latching it to βCys5 prior to subunit docking appeared to inhibit assembly. The teFSH seatbelt has a much greater influence than the NH2-terminal latch site on heterodimer assembly. Much less heterodimer was formed when the native human α-subunit was co-expressed with an analog of s/hCGβ-Nt in which the hCG seatbelt was replaced with the salmon seatbelt (i.e. s/hCGβ-Nt,SB, Table I, row 6). The small amount of s/hCGβ-Nt,SB that was assembled into heterodimers containing the native α-subunit was roughly as stable as that containing s/hCGβ-Nt,SB,C26A, suggesting that its seatbelt was latched to βCys5 in the NH2 terminus and not to βCys26 in loop β1. In fact, heterodimers containing s/hCGβ-Nt,SB,C26A, a β-subunit analog that has only a single seatbelt latch site, were produced more efficiently than those containing s/hCGβ-Nt,SB (Table I, data rows 6 and 7). This observation indicated that the salmon FSH seatbelt in s/hCGβ-Nt,SB became latched to each of these potential latch sites and that it may block threading when it is latched to βCys26. In subsequent studies, we converted βCys5 of s/hCGβ-Nt,SB to alanine, thereby creating s/hCGβ-Nt,SB,C5A, which lacks an NH2-terminal seatbelt latch site. This abolished heterodimer formation (not shown), confirming the notion that the seatbelt in heterodimers containing s/hCGβ-Nt,SB is latched to βCys5 and that latching the seatbelt to βCys26 in loop β1 suppressed assembly. Assembly of Glycoprotein Hormones in Which the Seatbelt Is Latched to a Cysteine in the β-Subunit NH2 Terminus Occurs by a Wraparound Route—Heterodimers in which the seatbelt was latched to the β-subunit NH2 terminus dissociated at pH 2, 37 °C, albeit much slower than hCG (Fig. 3). This showed that during acid-induced dissociation of teFSH analogs the glycosylated end of loop α2 can pass through the space between the seatbelt and the β-subunit core. Theoretically, the reversal of this process would permit heterodimer assembly by a threading mechanism, albeit at a very slow rate. The small space between the seatbelt and the subunit core suggested that threading would be highly unlikely, even if the tensor disulfide were to be disrupted during threading as is the case during the assembly of hCG (20Xing Y.

The threading and wrapping pathways could be distinguished if we were able to determine whether the seatbelt had been latched before or after the subunits docked. As discussed next, this can be accomplished using disulfide cross-links to trap early assembly intermediates. To trap early docking intermediates, we took advantage of the fact that the NH2-terminal ends of the subunits become adjacent when the heterodimer is assembled (2Lapthorn A.J. Harris D.C.

We reasoned that converting αGln5 to cysteine to create α-Q5C would enable the formation of an α5-β5 intersubunit disulfide, but only if the subunits docked before the seatbelt was latched (Fig. 4). Furthermore, because αCys5 is located near βCys5, the seatbelt latch site, we expected that during the wraparound pathway the seatbelt might also be latched to αCys5 instead of βCys5, provided the α5-β5 disulfide had not already been formed. Either of these phenomena would have resulted in an intersubunit disulfide cross-link that would prevent the heterodimer from dissociating upon treatment overnight at pH 2, 37 °C. In contrast, if assembly occurs by a threading mechanism instead of a wraparound mechanism, seatbelt residue βCys110 would have been cross-linked to βCys5 prior to docking. This would have prevented the formation of both the α5-β5 and α5-β110 disulfides and led to the formation of a heterodimer that dissociated with a half-life of 5–6 h during treatment at pH 2, 37 °C. Of course, it was also possible that during wrapping, seatbelt residue βCys110 would become latched to βCys5 to create a heterodimer that would also dissociate with a half-life of 5–6 h. Therefore, a finding that all the heterodimer dissociated with a half-life of 5–6 h would indicate but not prove that assembly occurs by a threading mechanism. However, the finding that a substantial fraction of the heterodimer was acid stable would show that most, if not all, heterodimer assembly had occurred by a wraparound mechanism. There was one other caveat to this approach. Co-expression of α-Q5C and hCGβ-R8C, analogs in which cysteines are substituted for hCG residues αGln5 and βArg8 has been shown to form a disulfide cross-linked heterodimer (14Heikoop J.C. van den Boogaart P. Mulders J.W.M. Grootenhuis P.D.J. Nat. Biotech. 1997; 15: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Formation of this disulfide is explained by the distances between the Cα and Cβ atoms of these residues (i.e. roughly 5.2 and 3.9 Å), which are similar to those in typical glycoprotein hormone disulfides (i.e. roughly 5–6.5 and 4 Å, respectively). The location of the salmon FSH β-subunit latch site corresponds to hCG β-subunit residue βLeu5, not βArg8, however. The distances between the Cα and Cβ atoms of αGln5 and βLeu5 are ∼9.1 and 11.1 Å, suggesting that when these residues are replaced with cysteines, their positions in the heterodimer might prevent them from forming a disulfide. To learn if an α5-β5 disulfide bridge can form during heterodimer assembly, we co-expressed hCGβ-L5C with the native α-subunit and with α-Q5C. Heterodimers formed with the native α-subunit were unstable at acid pH and dissociated within 30 min (Table I, data row 2); those formed when hCGβ-L5C was co-expressed with α-Q5C remained intact following an overnight incubation at pH 2, 37 °C (Table II, data row 1). Both heterodimers were recognized by antibody B111 (not shown), demonstrating that their seatbelts were latched to residue βCys26. This showed that heterodimers containing α-Q5C and hCGβ-L5C are stabilized by an α5-β5 disulfide bridge.Table IIThe ability of αCys5 to compete for seatbelt for the β-subunit N-terminal latch siteData rowAnalogTotal dimerpH 2, 0.5 hourspH 2, 16 hoursng/50μl ± S.E.% total ± S.E.1α-Q5C + hCGβ-L5C20.02 ± 1.94102.1 ± 6.1100.3 ± 3.62α-Q5C + hCGβ-L5C,C26A1.12 ± 0.0792.7 ± 0.791.9 ± 1.83α-Q5C + s/hCGβ-Nt7.25 ± 0.0997.1 ± 1.5102.9 ± 2.54α-Q5C + s/hCGβ-Nt,C26A0.73 ± 0.1091.9 ± 3.786.0 ± 3.55α-Q5C + s/hCGβ-Nt,SB,C26A1.98 ± 0.0589.9 ± 1.089.0 ± 0.96α-Q5C + s/hCGβ-L5C,SB,C26A8.22 ± 0.12104.1 ± 2.8102.7 ± 0.9 Open table in a new tab We reasoned that if seatbelt residue βCys110 is latched to βCys5 before the teFSH β-subunit docks with α-Q5C, neither of these β-subunit cysteines can be cross-linked to αCys5. We tested this possibility by co-expressing α-Q5C with hCGβ-L5C,C26A, an analog that has a teFSH folding pattern and in which the seatbelt appears to be latched efficiently to βCys5 before the subunits dock. This analog did not form detectable amounts of heterodimer with the native α-subunit (Table I, data row 3) and only small amounts were incorporated into heterodimers containing α-Q5C (Table II, row 2). Apparently, the seatbelt of hCGβ-L5C,C26A became latched to βCys5 before the subunits could dock, which precluded the formation of an αCys5-βCys5 disulfide bridge. The finding that small amounts of hCGβ-L5C,C26A were incorporated into heterodimers containing α-Q5C (Table II, row 2) showed that α-Q5C can be used to trap β-subunits that contain unlatched seatbelts, even when these represent a small fraction of the total β-subunit population. Based on the finding that less than 10% of these heterodimers dissociated after an overnight incubation at pH 2, 37 °C (Table II, data row 2), we anticipate that 9 of 10 heterodimer molecules contained an intersubunit disulfide between αCys5 and βCys5 or βCys110, which indicates that the subunits docked before the seatbelts were latched and that they were formed by a wraparound mechanism. The remaining heterodimer molecules appeared to contain an intrasubunit disulfide between βCys5 and βCys110. Whereas these could have been formed by a threading mechanism, the finding that the vast majority of heterodimers containing hCGβ-L5C,C26A were assembled by a wraparound mechanism suggested that the β5-β110 disulfide had also been formed by a wraparound mechanism after the subunits dock. As expected from the fact that hCGβ-L5C,C26A lacks a loop β1 latch site, heterodimers containing α-Q5C and hCGβ-L5C,C26A were not detected by B111 (not shown). These findings showed that the pathway used to assemble heterodimers containing teFSH analogs can be deduced from the abilities of their NH2-terminal β-subunit cysteines to become cross-linked to the NH2-terminal cysteine of α-Q5C. To learn how the salmon NH2 terminus affected subunit docking and seatbelt latching, we monitored the acid stabilities of heterodimers containing α-Q5C and s/hCGβ-Nt or s/hCGβ-Nt,C26A. These studies revealed that the pathway of assembly was essentially the same when the NH2-terminal latch site was surrounded by hCG or salmon FSH β-subunit residues. Coexpression of α-Q5C with s/hCGβ,Nt led to a substantial amount of acid-stable heterodimer (Table II, row 3) that was detected readily by B111 (not shown). This revealed that the hCG seatbelt of s/hCGβ-Nt had been latched to βCys26 in loop β1 prior to subunit docking, thereby enabling βCys5 in the β-subunit NH2 terminus to be cross-linked to αCys5 in the α-subunit NH2 terminus. In contrast, much smaller amounts of heterodimer were formed when βCys26 was replaced with alanine to create s/hCGβ-Nt,C26A (Table II, row 4). The reduction in heterodimer assembly caused by this change showed that the hCG seatbelt in s/hCGβ-Nt,C26A had been latched to βCys5 prior to assembly. In this position the seatbelt inhibited threading and, by being in a disulfide with βCys5, prevented the formation of the α5-β8 disulfide. As had been observed for heterodimers containing α-Q5C and hCGβ-L5C,C26A, a small fraction of the heterodimers containing α-Q5C and hCGβ-Nt,C26A were acid labile. This indicated that some of the seatbelt had been latched to βCys5, most likely after the subunits had docked. To learn how the composition of the seatbelt affected subunit docking and seatbelt latching, we monitored the acid stabilities of heterodimers containing α-Q5C and β-subunits s/hCGβ-Nt,SB,C26A and s/hCGβ-L5C,SB,C26A. These β-subunits are analogs of s/hCGβ-Nt,C26A and hCGβ-L5C,C26A in which the hCG seatbelt has been replaced with its salmon FSH counterpart. The presence of the salmon seatbelt increased the amount of heterodimer formed significantly. For example, 3-fold more heterodimer was obtained with s/hCGβ-Nt,SB,C26A than with s/hCGβ-Nt,C26A (Table II, rows 5 and 4) and 7–8-fold more heterodimer was obtained with s/hCGβ-L5C,SB,C26A than with hCGβ-L5C,C26A (Table II, rows 6 and 2). Most of the heterodimers formed were acid stable, which is consistent with the notion that they had been formed by a wraparound mechanism. These findings indicated that the salmon FSH seatbelt is not latched to βCys5 as rapidly as the hCG seatbelt and, as a result, more βCys5 was available to form a disulfide with αCys5. As had been observed for heterodimers containing the hCGβ-L5C,C26A and s/hCGβ-Nt,C26A subunits, about 10% of the heterodimer containing the s/hCGβ-Nt,SB,C26A subunit dissociated at low pH. This suggested that the seatbelt had also become latched to βCys5 in a small fraction of the heterodimer, most likely by a wraparound mechanism. The teFSH Seatbelt Can Be Latched to the"

Thus, when E. coli encounters phenylacetylated compounds, the periplasmic PGA degrades them to PAA, and this moiety then diffuses into the nucleoplasm. PaaK, the PAA-CoA ligase, converts the PAA to PAA-CoA (11Ferrandez A. Minambres B. Garcia B. Olivera E.R. Luengo J.M. Garcia J.L. Diaz E. J. Biol.

Eng. 2001; 17: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar); however, there is no direct evidence that CRP or IHF proteins bind to the promoter (35Werner M.H. Burley S.K. Cell. 1997; 88: 733-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It has been inferred that the pga promoter is a class III CRP-dependent promoter (21Stojcevic N. Moric I. Begovic J. Radoja S. Konstantinovic M. Biomol. Eng. 2001; 17: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have clarified several important features of the regulation of pga expression. First, we have shown that PaaX is a transcriptional repressor of pga expression. Second, we have identified the PaaX-binding consensus sequence. Third, these findings have led us to characterize “PAA induction,” the increase of PGA production in the presence of PAA, as primarily resulting from relief of pga from repression by PaaX. Fourth, we have demonstrated that the pga promoter is a class III CRP-dependent promoter. Finally, we have shown that the PaaX repressor and CRP activator compete for binding to the pga promoter in a region around the upstream CRP-binding site (site I), and we have established that this competition for binding underlies the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of pga in response to PAA. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, Primers, and Chemicals—The bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers used in this study are listed in the Supplemental Material. pUCK was constructed by inserting the kanamycin resistance gene into the β-lactamase gene of pUC18 (36, Kim, H. S. (1995) Analysis of regulatory sequences and factor involved in the expression of penicillin G acylase gene in Escherichia coli. M.Sc. thesis, Seoul National UniversityGoogle Scholar). All primers were synthesized by GenoTech. Chemicals for media were purchased from Difco, and we bought other chemicals from Sigma unless stated. Growth Media and Culture Condition—E. coli W ATCC11105 and its derivatives were grown at 30 °C with shaking at 180 rpm in M9 minimal medium (37Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2% glycerol or 0.2% glucose as sole carbon source; when required, 0.05% PAA was added. Other standard molecular biological procedures were performed according to Sambrook and Russel (38Sambrook J. Russel D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) by using E. coli DH5α cells grown at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm in LB medium containing 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 40 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). When required, media were solidified with 2% agar powder. Antibiotics were added at the following concentrations as appropriate: 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 10 μg/ml tetracycline. Construction of Plasmids—Various plasmids harboring the pga promoter derivatives were constructed in two steps. First, the largest DNA fragment of pUCK-C1 was generated by PCR (AccuPower PCR PreMix, Bioneer) with the genomic DNA of E. coli W ATCC11105 as template and the up-700-EcoRI/down-1-PstI primer set. The PCR product was column-purified (Nucleogen), digested with EcoRI (EcoRI restriction sites were introduced into all up-series primers) and PstI (PstI restriction sites were introduced into all down-series primers), re-purified through a column, and inserted into pUCK digested with the same restriction enzymes and column-purified. After transformation, colonies harboring the recombinant plasmid were identified and confirmed by sequencing. Second, the smaller DNA fragments were also obtained by PCR using pUCK-C1 as template with the relevant primer sets and subsequent digestion with DpnI (New England Biolabs) to degrade the template. The PCR products were treated as in the case of pUCK-C1, and the corresponding plasmids were constructed. To overexpress the recombinant paaX and crp genes, it was cloned from the genomic DNA of E. coli W by PCR and inserted into pET-30a(+) (Novagen) so that it was tagged with the His6 tag and several linker amino acids. PCR was carried out with the paaX-NcoI-5/paaX-EcoRI-3 and crp-NcoI-5/crp-EcoRI-3 primer sets, and the product was column-purified, digested with NcoI and EcoRI, re-purified, and inserted into pET-30a(+) digested with the same restriction enzymes and column-purified. Similarly, pUC-paaK and pUC-paaX that overexpress recombinant paaK and paaX were made by PCR with paaK-EcoRI-5/paaK-EcoRI-3 and paaX-EcoRI-5/paaX-EcoRI-3 primer sets and subsequent subcloning into pUC18. pMAK705 derivatives were constructed in three steps. First, the pga promoter in pUCK-C3 had undergone site-directed mutagenesis. Second, PCR was carried out with pUCK-C3 derivatives as templates and up-200-EcoRI/down-1-EcoRI primer set. The PCR products were column-purified, digested with EcoRI, re-purified, and inserted into pRS415 (39Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 53: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar) digested with the same restriction enzyme and column-purified. The orientation of promoters was confirmed by PCR with up-200-EcoRI/lacZ-down-BamHI primer set. Third, by using the up-200-BamHI/lacZ-down-BamHI primer set, Ppga::lacZ fragments were obtained and digested with BamHI that was subsequently inserted into pMAK705 (40Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) digested with the same restriction enzyme. pMAK-705-del-lacZ plasmid was constructed in three steps. First, the upstream and downstream regions of the lacZ open reading frame were obtained by PCR with the genomic DNA of E. coli W as template and lacZ-del-up-5/lacZ-del-up-3 and lacZ-del-down-5/lacZ-del-down-3 primer sets, respectively. Second, they were digested with AscI and ligated with the equal amount of each fragments. Third, ligated fragments were digested with BamHI and inserted into pMAK705 digested with the same restriction enzyme. Several colonies were analyzed by PCR with lacZ-del-up-5/lacZ-del-down-3 primer set to confirm the existence of each upstream and downstream region. For ChIP assays, we constructed pREP42-crp and pREP42-paaX plasmids with crp-BglII-5/crp-NotI-3 and paaX-BglII/paaX-NotI-3 primer sets, respectively, in a similar way as above. Site-directed Mutagenesis—PCR-based, site-directed mutagenesis was performed with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The primers that already contain an altered base at the desired site were synthesized according to the manufacturer's instructions, but their size was adjusted to enhance the specificity of annealing during PCR. PCR was performed with pUCK-C3 as template and the relevant primer sets, and PCR products were digested with DpnI to degrade the template. Colonies harboring the mutagenized plasmid were identified by mini-prep and sequencing. When another mutation has to be introduced, PCR was performed with single base substituted plasmid as template. Construction of Mutant Cell Lines—We constructed deletion mutants of E. coli W ATCC11105 by homologous recombination between a PCR-generated linear DNA fragment containing an antibiotic resistance gene and chromosomal DNA, catalyzed by the λ RED system (41Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar). E. coli W ATCC11105 cells were transformed with pIJ790 (42Gust B. Challis G.L. Fowler K. Kieser T. Chater K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar), and electrocompetent cells were prepared as described (41Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar) with some modifications. (i) The cells were cultured in LB medium. (ii) l-Arabinose was used to induce the λ RED system at a concentration of 100 mm. The linear DNA fragments were obtained by PCR with 70-base primers that consisted of the following two regions: a 5′ 50-base region complementary to part of the target gene, and a 3′ 20-base region complementary to the tetracycline resistance gene. PCR was performed with pBR322 plasmid as template, and the product was completely digested with DpnI and column-purified. Electroporation was carried out with a Gene-Pulser (Bio-Rad) with a 0.1-cm cuvette containing 50 μl of electrocompetent cells and 5 μl of PCR product. After shocking at 1.8 kV, 1 ml of ice-cold LB medium was added immediately, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm for 1 h. The regenerated cells were spread on an LB agar plate containing tetracycline and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Colonies were streaked onto a new plate for further purification, and several clones were analyzed by PCR to confirm deletion of the target gene. Confirmed deletion strains were cultured in 50 ml of LB medium at 42 °C with shaking at 200 rpm for 24 h to prevent the multiplication of pIJ790 that depends on a temperature-sensitive replication origin. 0.5 ml of the cultured cells were transferred to fresh medium and further incubated under the same conditions. After three successive cultures, the cells were diluted and plated to isolate single colonies. Single colonies were tested for sensitivity to tetracycline to confirm the absence of pIJ790. Penicillin G Acylase Assays—The penicillin G acylase assays were performed as described previously (32Lee H.S. Park O.K. Kang H.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 43Bomstein J. Evans W.G. Anal. Chem. 1965; 37: 576-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase Assays—β-Galactosidase activities of E. coli W, grown at 30 °C on a shaking incubator, were measured as described (37Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA from E. coli W ATCC11105 cells was prepared with an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The appropriate conditions were determined empirically at various points during growth. The quality of the total RNA was checked both by formamide gel electrophoresis visualized by EtBr staining and PCR with the up-200-EcoRI/down-1-PstI primer set, which is complementary to the nontranscribed region of the pga gene. When required, 10 units of RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) was added to 10 μg of total RNA and incubated at 37 °C for at least 4 h to degrade contaminating genomic DNA. After clean-up using the same kit, RNA purity was reconfirmed. The DNA-free total RNA was then used in RT-PCR with a one-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). Reaction mixtures contained 1 ng of total RNA and 30 pmol each of the pga-RNA-5/pga-RNA-3 primer set, which is complementary to the 3′ 800-base region of the pga structural gene. 30-(Fig. 5) or 35-cycle (Fig. 1) reactions were carried out.Fig. 1Evidence that PaaX is the transcriptional repressor of pga expression.Panel A, PGA activity of wild type (WT), ΔpaaX, ΔpaaK, and ΔpaaX cells complemented by pUC-paaX. All values are averages of three independent experiments. Standard deviations, shown by bars, did not exceed 20%.

The cells were diluted 100-fold in 20 ml of the same medium, grown to A600 of 1, diluted again 100-fold into 2 liters of the same medium, and incubated at 160 rpm. At mid-log phase (A600 = 0.5), 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and the cells were further incubated for 4 h. They were harvested and washed with TEN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) and lysed with a BugBuster protein extraction reagent plus a Benzonase nuclease (Novagen). His-PaaX was purified with a His·Bind column (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The eluates were dialyzed to remove imidazole and adjust the salt concentration. The imidazole concentration could be reduced to 0.5 m without loss of protein, and the same volume of 100% glycerol was then added. Protein samples were dispensed into aliquots and stored at -70 °C. Protein was measured with a Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit, and protein samples were analyzed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels at each step of purification. In the case of CRP, we transformed E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cell with pET-30a(+)-crp and followed the same procedures as PaaX with minor modifications. The final eluates of His-CRP were dialyzed to remove imidazole completely. Subsequently, His-CRP recombinant proteins were cleaved by enterokinase and purified to remove both the His6 tag and enterokinase with an Enterokinase Cleavage Capture kit (Novagen). An intact form of the purified CRP was dispensed into aliquots by adding an equal volume of 100% glycerol and stored at -70 °C. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The various pga promoter derivatives used in EMSAs were prepared by digesting the corresponding plasmids with EcoRI and PstI and purifying them on a Nucleogen column. The fragment from pUCK-C3 (from -200 to -1) as well as others was labeled with [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Biosciences) with a Prime-a-Gene labeling system (Promega) and purified with a QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen). Basic reaction mixtures contained 2 fmol of DNA probe, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm imidazole, 2 pmol of His-PaaX in a final volume of 40 μl. When required, 200 or 300 fmol of unlabeled promoter construct was added, and PAA or PAA-CoA was provided at the stated concentrations. After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, reaction mixtures were loaded onto 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 5% glycerol, which had been pre-electrophoresed at 7 V/cm for 30 min, and run at 15 V/cm for 2 h 30 min. The gels were dried onto Whatman 3MM paper and visualized by autoradiography. In EMSA with CRP proteins, basic reaction mixtures contained 2 fmol of DNA probe, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 4 nmol of cAMP, and CRP proteins in a final volume of 40 μl. After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, reaction mixtures were loaded onto 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 5% glycerol and 0.1 mm cAMP, which had been pre-electrophoresed at 7 V/cm for 30 min with 0.5× TBE containing 0.1 mm cAMP, and run at 15 V/cm for 3 (Fig. 6, panel A) or for 1 h (Fig. 6, panel B). The gels were dried onto Whatman 3MM paper and visualized by autoradiography. DNase I Footprinting Experiment—The pga promoter fragment used in DNase I footprinting experiments was prepared from pUCK-C3 as described above. The reaction mixture contained 50 fmol of DNA probe, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm imidazole in a final volume of 200 μl. His-PaaX was used at 0, 2, 5, and 10 pmol. After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, 5 μl of DNase I (Novagen) solution, diluted 10-fold in dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm MgCl2, 200 mm CaCl2, and 50% glycerol), was added, and incubation was continued for 10 min. To terminate the reaction, 700 μl of DNase I stop solution (5 μl of E. coli tRNA (1 mg/ml) and 50 μl of saturated ammonium acetate in 100% ethanol) were added and rapidly mixed by vortexing vigorously. The reaction mixtures were placed in a dry ice/ethanol bath for 20 min, centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min to precipitate the DNA, washed twice with ice-cold 70% ethanol, and dried in a speedvac evaporator. The pellets were resuspended in 5 μl of formamide loading buffer (80% formamide, 10 mm NaOH, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and heated at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by immediate quenching on wet ice. Samples were loaded onto 8 or 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea for Fig. 3, panels A or B, respectively, pre-electrophoresed at 40 V/cm for 30 min, and run 40 V/cm for 2 h 30 min. Gels were dried onto Whatman 3MM paper and visualized by autoradiography. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—The chromatin immunoprecipitation assays for detecting in vivo protein-DNA interactions were done essentially as described (44Hecht A. Grunstein M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. pREP42-paaX and pREP42-crp were transformed with the ΔpaaX and Δcrp, carrying pMAK705 derivatives, respectively, and they were grown to late log phase followed by treatment with 1% formaldehyde and immunoprecipitation with monoclonal mouse anti-c-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). DNA fragments co-immunoprecipitated with the 2× cMyc-tagged proteins were used as template in PCR to amplify the pga promoter region from -200 to -1, and DNA samples treated without antibody were used as negative control. PCR program with 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s was applied. PCR products were fractionated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed. PaaX Is the Repressor of pga Expression—Although E. coli pga has been known for a long time to be negatively regulated (45Mayer H. Collins J. Wagner F. Timmis K.N. Puhler A. Plasmids of Medical, Environmental, and Commercial Importance. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1979: 459-470Google Scholar), the identity of the regulator has not been established. When we transformed E. coli W (PGA+) with the multicopy plasmid pUCK-C, a derivative of pUC18 harboring the upstream pga promoter region from -700 to -22, the constitutive PGA activity of the transformants increased by a factor of 3 (36, Kim, H. S. (1995) Analysis of regulatory sequences and factor involved in the expression of penicillin G acylase gene in Escherichia coli. M.Sc. thesis, Seoul National UniversityGoogle Scholar). This indicated that some repressor was binding to the pga promoter in pUCK-C, causing the concentration of free repressor to fall and permitting pga to be transcribed more frequently. In seeking candidates for this repressor, we made the assumption that the enzymatic activity of PGA is functionally linked to PAA metabolism because PGA production is greatly stimulated by PAA. We therefore focused on the regulatory components of the paa operon responsible for catabolizing PAA for use as a sole carbon source (11Ferrandez A. Minambres B. Garcia B. Olivera E.R. Luengo J.M. Garcia J.L. Diaz E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25974-25986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, PaaX, the repressor of the paa operon encoded by paaX, binds to the divergent Pa and Pz promoters to prevent transcription of the meta-cleavage pathway gene cluster. However, when PAA is present, PaaK, the PAA-CoA ligase encoded by paaK, converts PAA to PAA-CoA and this inhibits PaaX from binding to the promoter and initiates expression from the Pa and Pz promoters (12Ferrandez A. Garcia J.L. Diaz E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12214-12222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Prompted by these findings, we constructed two deletion mutants of E. coli W, ΔpaaX and ΔpaaK, and performed PGA assays with these mutants grown in M9 minimal medium containing glycerol but without PAA. Fig. 1 shows that the ΔpaaX cells had much higher PGA activity than the wild type cells, and the ΔpaaK cells had lower activity. As a control we showed that the ΔpaaX cells transformed with pUC-paaX had reduced basal PGA activity (Fig. 1, panel A), and RT-PCR analysis confirmed that pga mRNA was elevated in the ΔpaaX cells (Fig. 1, panel B). These findings strongly suggested that PaaX was the repressor of pga expression. In these experiments we used endogenous β-galactosidase as an internal control, and we measured the constitutive levels of both its activity and its mRNA (data not shown). In order to locate precisely the promoter region to which PaaX binds, we gene"
https://openalex.org/W2096090498,"Activation of the Raf kinase signal transduction pathway in skeletal myoblasts causes a complete cessation of myofiber formation and muscle gene expression. The negative impacts of the signaling pathway are realized through downstream activation of mitogen and extracellular kinase (MEK) phosphorylation-dependent events and MEK-independent signal transmission. MEKK1, a kinase that can physically associate with Raf, may contribute to the MEK-independent signaling in response to elevated Raf activity. Myogenic cells overexpressing activated Raf and kinase-defective MEKK1 remain differentiation-defective, suggesting that MEKK1 does not contribute to the inhibitory actions of Raf. However, constitutive activation of MEKK1 dramatically inhibits biochemical and morphological measures of muscle formation. MEKK1 inhibits MyoD-directed transcriptional activity without altering the ability of the protein to form heterodimers with E2A proteins or bind DNA. By contrast, the transcriptional activity of E47, the preferred dimer partner of the myogenic regulatory factors, is severely compromised by MEKK1-initiated signaling. Inhibition of MEK1/2 and JNK1/2 function did not reinstate E47-directed transcription, indicating that these two downstream kinases likely are not involved in the MEKK1-controlled transcriptional block. Inhibition of p38 signaling overcame the negative effects exerted by MEKK1 on the amino terminus of E47. Closer examination indicates that E47 is phosphorylated in vitro by p38, and deletion analysis predicts that the critical amino acid(s) phosphorylated by p38 lie outside of the minimal transcriptional activation domains. Thus, modification of E47 by p38 likely disrupts higher order protein complex formation that is necessary for muscle gene transcription.

The block to myocyte formation is inclusive of both inhibition of muscle-specific gene transcription and attainment of fusion competency. Activation of MAPK through overexpression of constitutively active mutants of Raf leads to a robust induction of the Raf/MEK/MAPK signaling module that results in suppression of skeletal myogenesis. The negative impact of Raf can often be abrogated by supplementation of culture media with chemical inhibitors to MEK1 (1Dorman C.M. Johnson S.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5167-5176Google Scholar). Interestingly, myocytes overexpressing Raf CAAX, a membrane-localized Raf protein, remain refractile to treatment with MEK inhibitors as measured by their inability to fuse or activate muscle gene expression (1Dorman C.M. Johnson S.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5167-5176Google Scholar, 5Dorman C.M. Johnson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27481-27487Google Scholar, 6Wang X. Thomson S.R. Starkey J.D. Page J.L. Ealy A.D. Johnson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2528-2534Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that secondary pathways initiated by Raf kinase contribute to the block to myogenesis. The molecular basis for the Raf-imposed inhibition of myogenesis involves disruption of MEF2 function (4Winter B. Arnold H.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4211-4220Google Scholar). MEF2, a MADS (MCM1, agamous, deficiens, serum response factor) box transcription factor, acts in concert with the myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) to promote muscle gene transcription (7Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9366-9373Google Scholar, 8Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Google Scholar). Overexpression of activating mutants of Raf leads to sequestration of MEF2 in the cytoplasm of myoblasts (4Winter B. Arnold H.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4211-4220Google Scholar). Relocalization of MEF2 to the nucleus through transfection of MEF2-encoding plasmids or through prevention of MEK activation leads to myoblast fusion and muscle gene expression in mouse cells. Interestingly, this phenomenon may be unique to various types of skeletal muscle cells. Coexpression of MEF2 in avian myoblasts transduced with activated Raf did not reinstitute the myogenic gene program (9Johnson S.E. Dorman C.M. Bolanowski S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28742-28748Google Scholar). Moreover, a direct effect of MEK1 on the MRFs may contribute to inhibition of myogenesis. Nuclear localization of MEK1 allows the kinase to directly interact with MyoD and prevent the MRF from directing muscle gene expression (2Perry R.L. Parker M.H. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 291-301Google Scholar). Thus, it is probable that multiple nuclear factors are perturbed in their functions by chronic Raf activities that cooperatively act to prevent skeletal myogenesis. MEK kinase 1 (MEKK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that induces downstream activation of amino-terminal Jun kinase (JNK), and to a lesser extent, ERK1/2, via activation of MEK1 (for a review, see Ref. 10Schlesinger T.K. Fanger G.R. Yujiri T. Johnson G.L. Front Biosci. 1998; 3: D1181-D1186Google Scholar). MEKK1 falls into the same classification as Raf as a mitogen-activated kinase kinase kinase. Sequential phosphorylation and activation of MEKK1/MKK4/JNK can lead to a plethora of events including apoptosis, cell survival, or proliferation (11Boldt S. Weidle U.H. Kolch W. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 283: 80-90Google Scholar, 12Bonvin C. Guillon A. van Bemmelen M.X. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Widmann C. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 123-131Google Scholar, 13Lee F.S. Peters R.T. Dang L.C.

Initiation of JNK signaling in skeletal myocytes appears to represent an impediment to complete differentiation. L6 and quail myoblasts overexpessing activated forms of Rac1, an upstream inducer of MEKK1, synthesize reduced levels of skeletal muscle proteins and form myocytes that are substantially smaller in size and exhibit disorganized sarcomeric arrangements (20Gallo R. Serafini M. Castellani L. Falcone G. Alema S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3137-3150Google Scholar, 21Meriane M. Roux P. Primig M. Fort P. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2513-2528Google Scholar). In a similar manner, forced expression of an activated form of MKK7, a JNK-activating kinase, results in elevated levels of JNK that are accompanied by a loss of myocyte formation and muscle gene expression (22Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40120-40127Google Scholar). Although high JNK activity can be associated with enhanced programmed cell death, no increase in the numbers of apoptotic muscle cells was noted. In addition to its ability regulate JNK activity, MEKK1 physically associates with components of the Raf, MEK, and ERK1/2 signaling module (22Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40120-40127Google Scholar). By serving as a scaffolding kinase, MEKK1 may collaborate with Raf to prevent muscle formation. Furthermore, an essential role for MEKK1 has been documented in Raf-mediated fibroblast transformation through its ability to modulate NFκB activity, a known inhibitor of myogenesis (23Baumann B. Weber C.K. Troppmair J. Whiteside S. Israel A. Rapp U.R. Wirth T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4615-4620Google Scholar, 24Mitin N. Kudla A.J. Konieczny S.F. Taparowsky E.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1276-1286Google Scholar). Inhibition of MEK/ERK activity in Raf-expressing cells does not prevent NFκB activation, but forced expression of kinase-defective MEKK1 does eliminate NFκB activation by Raf. Because of the mutual effects of the MEKK1 and Raf signaling modules, we assessed the capacity of MEKK1 to contribute to the Raf-imposed block to skeletal myogenesis. Our results indicate that both MEKK1 and Raf inhibit muscle differentiation but that neither kinase directly shares in the repressive actions of the other. Interestingly, myoblasts expressing MEKK1 do not direct substantial levels of downstream JNK, indicating that MEKK1 inhibition is directed through an alternate pathway. The means by which MEKK1 inhibits myogenesis include increased p38 activity that reduces the functional capabilities of E47, the obligate heterodimer partner of the MRFs. E47 retains its ability to bind to a consensus DNA E-box element but fails to transactivate a multimerized immunoglobulin E-box reporter gene. Deletion analysis reveals that p38 phosphorylates E47 within the amino terminus on a serine residue that lies outside of the transcriptional activation domain. In summary, MEKK1 inhibits skeletal myogenesis independent of the actions of Raf and through a mechanism that implicates increased p38 kinase activity.

Semiconfluent C3H10T1/2 cells (1 × 105) cultured in 6-well tissueware were transiently transfected with 1 μg of reporter gene (TnI-Luc, AP1-Luc, 4Rtk-Luc, μE-Luc, pG5T-Luc), 0.5 μg of activator plasmids (pEM-MyoD, CMV-E47, Gal4DB-E47-(1–355), Gal4DB-MyoD-(1–66) Gal4DB-E47-(271–582)), 0.5 μg of kinase (CMV-Raf BXB, CMV-Raf CAAX, CMV-Raf BXB301, pcDNA-MEKK1, pcDNA-MEKK1Δ, pcDNA-MEKK1ΔDN, pBABE-MEK A221, pBABE MEK 217/218, pcDNA-MKK6AL, pcDNA-SEKAL), and 50 ng of pRL-tk by calcium phosphate precipitate formation. The proteins encoded by the various plasmids are described in “Results.” After 48 h in growth media or differentiation media (low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin), the cells were lysed, and reporter luciferase and Renilla luciferase (pRL-tk) activities were measured. Western Blot—Cultures of cells were scraped into 4× SDS-PAGE lysis buffer (250 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.4% β-mercaptoethanol), and protein concentrations were measured (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were separated through SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 60 min prior to the addition of the primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer. Antibodies and dilutions were anti-myosin heavy chain (MF20, Developmental Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, IA, 1:10 culture supernatant), anti-myogenin (F5D, Developmental Hybridoma Bank, 1:3,000 ascites fluid), anti-MyoD (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, 1:3,000), anti-MAPK and anti-phosphoMAPK (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-JNK and anti-phosphoJNK (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-MEKK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:3,000), anti-Myc (9E10 ascites fluid, Developmental Hybridoma Bank, 1:5,000), and anti-E47 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1,000). After washing with TBS-T, blots were incubated in peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 60 min. Blots were washed, and immunocomplexes were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to x-ray film. Electrophorectic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared by scraping the cells into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation and lysed in hypotonic buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of aprotonin, pepstatin, leupeptin) for 10 min on ice. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in high salt extraction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of aprotonin, pepstatin, leupeptin) and rocked at 4 °C for 60 min. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Nuclear proteins were aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. Double-stranded DNA E-box probes (μE5, TnI) were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Free label was removed by centrifugation through Sephadex G50 resin columns (Sigma). Twenty micrograms of nuclear extract proteins were incubated with [32P]TnI or [32P]μE5 (10,000 cpm) and 1 μg of an antibody directed against a Myc epitope (E47), hemagglutinin epitope (MyoD∼E47), or E47 (N649; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) on ice for 20 min. The protein-DNA complexes were separated through 5% nondenaturing acrylamide gels in medium-high ionic strength buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)) as described (25Lin H. Yutzey K.E. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 267-280Google Scholar). DNA binding complexes were visualized by autoradiography. In Vitro Kinase Assays—One microgram of bacterially expressed recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST), GST-ATF2-(1–96), GST-E47, GST-E47-(1–355), and GST-E47-(271–582) was incubated at 30 °C under gentle agitation for 30 min in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.135 mm NaVO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μm ATP) containing 5 μCi of [32P]ATP in the presence or absence of 25 ng of p38α or p38β (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA). Reactions were terminated by the addition of 4× SDS-PAGE buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were resolved through 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Gels were fixed and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Radiolabeled bands were visualized by phosphorimaging (Storm 860, Amersham Biosciences). Activated Raf Does Not Require MEKK1 for MEK-independent Signaling—Our previous work demonstrated that Raf CAAX induces substantial levels of ERK1/2 activity that is acquired through a non-MEK mechanism (1Dorman C.M. Johnson S.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5167-5176Google Scholar). MEKK1 can assemble with components of the Raf/MEK/MAPK signaling module, and low levels of ERK1/2 activity are found upon MEKK1 induction (22Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40120-40127Google Scholar). To measure the contribution of MEKK1 signaling to the Raf-imposed block to myogenesis, C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were transfected with pEM-MyoD, troponin I luciferase (TnI-Luc), and expression plasmids coding for a kinase-defective MEKK1 (pcDNA-MEKK1ΔDN) and activated Raf (CMV-RafCAAX). The Renilla luciferase expression plasmid, pRL-tk, was included as a monitor of transfection efficiency. After 48 h, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were measured. The amount of corrected activity directed by MyoD was set to 100%. As expected, MyoD readily activated the complex muscle reporter, TnI-Luc, and this level of activity was inhibited in the presence of Raf CAAX (Fig. 1A). The kinase-inactive MEKK1 protein did not alter MyoD-directed reporter gene activation, nor did the protein reverse the negative effects of activated Raf in this system. In a similar manner, MEKK1ΔDN failed to restore MyoD-directed myofiber formation in the presence of activated Raf (Fig. 1B). Therefore, MEKK1 does not contribute significantly to inhibition of muscle formation in myoblasts overexpressing activated Raf. MEKK1 Inhibits MyoD-directed Skeletal Myogenesis—Previous work demonstrated the ability of MEKK1 to inhibit C2C12 myofiber formation in vitro (26Allen D.L. Leinwand L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45323-45330Google Scholar). Inhibition of JNK signaling in vivo partially restored muscle function in a model of muscular dystrophy (27Kolodziejczyk S.M. Walsh G.S. Balazsi K. Seale P. Sandoz J. Hierlihy A.M. Rudnicki M.A. Chamberlain J.S. Miller F.D. Megeney L.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1278-1282Google Scholar). To clarify the mechanism by which MEKK1 alters myogenesis, C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were transiently transfected with expression plasmids coding for MyoD, the constitutively active kinase domain of MEKK1 (MEKK1Δ), and the muscle reporter genes, TnI-Luc or 4Rtk-Luc. Following treatment for 48 h in differentiation-permissive media, the cells were lysed, and reporter gene activities were measured. Parallel plates transfected in a similar manner were fixed for immunocytochemistry or lysed for Western analysis. Overexpression of MEKK1Δ inhibited activation of the complex muscle promoter reporter by 80% (Fig. 2A). MEKK1Δ failed to significantly alter transcription from the multimerized E-box reporter gene, suggesting that signaling through the kinase does not directly affect MyoD function. The complete myogenic program was disrupted; myoblasts overexpressing activated MEKK1Δ did not fuse into multinucleated myofibers that synthesize myosin heavy chain (MyHC) (Fig. 2B). The inability to undergo myogenic conversion was not a consequence of low MyoD protein levels. Western blot analysis using an antibody specific for MyoD demonstrated the presence of abundant amounts of the transcription factor irrespective of MEKK1Δ expression (Fig. 2C). MEKK1 Inhibits Myogenesis Independent of JNK and ERK1/2 Activation—In numerous cell types, MEKK1 initiates downstream signaling events that involve activation of ERK1/2 and JNK (10Schlesinger T.K. Fanger G.R. Yujiri T. Johnson G.L. Front Biosci. 1998; 3: D1181-D1186Google Scholar). Both ERK1/2 and JNK activation are capable of impeding muscle formation (1Dorman C.M. Johnson S.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5167-5176Google Scholar, 2Perry R.L. Parker M.H. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 291-301Google Scholar, 4Winter B. Arnold H.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4211-4220Google Scholar, 20Gallo R. Serafini M. Castellani L. Falcone G. Alema S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3137-3150Google Scholar, 27Kolodziejczyk S.M. Walsh G.S. Balazsi K. Seale P. Sandoz J. Hierlihy A.M. Rudnicki M.A. Chamberlain J.S. Miller F.D. Megeney L.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1278-1282Google Scholar). To define the mechanism through which MEKK1 inhibits myoblast differentiation, C310T1/2 fibroblasts were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding MyoD and MEKK1Δ. Subsequent to fixation, cells were treated for 48 h in differentiation medium containing chemical inhibitors to MEK1/2 (PD98059) and JNK (SP600125). Immunostaining for MyHC demonstrates the robust ability of MyoD to initiate myogenic conversion (Fig. 3A). Treatment of the cells with either PD98059 or SP600125 did not inhibit MyoD-directed myofiber formation, suggesting that MEK1/2 and JNK are not necessary for muscle formation. Fibroblasts expressing MyoD and MEKK1Δ were devoid of MyHC immunopositive fibers. Interestingly, treatment of these cells with either 20 μm PD98059 or 50 μm SP600125 did not restore myofiber formation. To verify the effective dosages of the inhibitors, skeletal myoblasts were treated with PD98059 and SP600125, and the levels of phospoERK1/2 and phosphoJNK were measured. 23A2RafER myoblasts express an inducible Raf allele that initiates downstream activation of ERK1/2 upon the addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen to the culture medium (6Wang X. Thomson S.R. Starkey J.D. Page J.L. Ealy A.D. Johnson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2528-2534Google Scholar). Treatment of these myoblasts with 20 μm PD98059 efficiently prevented the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the presence or absence of Raf signaling (Fig. 3B). C2C12 myoblasts were treated with 2 mm hydrogen peroxide to induce downstream JNK activity, as described previously (29Zhou L.Z. Johnson A.P. Rando T.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1405-1416Google Scholar). Western analysis using an antibody specific for phosphoJNK demonstrated the activation of JNK by H2O2 (Fig. 3C). Supplementation of the culture medium with 50 μm SP600125 completely abolished JNK activation without altering endogenous levels of the kinase. Thus, the concentrations of PD98059 and SP600125 are sufficient to prevent activation of ERK1/2 and JNK. E47 Transcriptional Activity Is Inhibited by MEKK1 Signaling—Optimal muscle gene expression initiated by the MRFs is achieved through heterodimer formation with E2A proteins (30Lassar A.B. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Kadesch T. Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1991; 66: 305-315Google Scholar). The E2A proteins, E47 and E12, are ubiquitously expressed bHLH transcription factors (31Bain G. Murre C. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 143-153Google Scholar). The ability of MEKK1 to affect E47 function was examined in fibroblasts. In brief, C3H10T1/2 cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids coding for E47 and MEKK1Δ and a multimerized immunoglobulin E-box reporter gene (μE5-Luc). pRL-tk was included as a monitor of transfection efficiency. As shown in Fig. 4A, E47 readily stimulated transcription from the luciferase reporter gene. Co-expression of MEKK1Δ with E47 severely reduced the levels of μE5-Luc activity. Loss of E47-directed transcription was not a product of altered protein levels. Western analysis of cell lysates indicated substantial E47 protein synthesis in the absence and presence of MEKK1 (Fig. 4B). MEKK1 Inhibits the Transcriptional Activity of E47 Containing Homo- and Heterodimer Complexes Independent of Their Ability to Bind DNA—To test the hypothesis that MEKK1 inhibits myogenesis by disruption of functional MRF-E47 transcriptional complexes, pECE-MyoD∼E47, an expression plasmid coding for a forced heterodimer of the respective proteins, was employed (32Neuhold L.A. Wold B. Cell. 1993; 74: 1033-1042Google Scholar). C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding the tethered protein and MEKK1Δ and the reporter gene, TnI-Luc or 4Rtk-Luc. After 48 h in differentiation media, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were measured. Levels of corrected MyoD∼E47 activity were set to 100%. As expected, the forced heterodimer readily stimulated TnI-Luc activity, which was inhibited by co-expression of MEKK1Δ (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, MEKK1Δ prevented efficient transactivation of 4Rtk-Luc by MyoD∼E47. Expression of the tethered protein and appropriate localization were confirmed by Western blot and immunocytochemistry. Fibroblast cultures transfected as described above were lysed in 4× SDS-PAGE buffer, and protein from equal cell numbers was electrophoretically separated and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blot analysis using an antibody-directed E47 demonstrated the presence of a single protein corresponding to MyoD∼E47 irrespective of MEKK1D expression (Fig. 5B). The ability of E47 homo- and heterodimers to bind DNA was verified by an electrophorectic mobility shift assay. In brief, C2C12 myoblasts were transiently transfected with mammalian expression plasmids coding for E47, MyoD∼E47, and MEKK1Δ. Myofiber nuclear proteins were purified following 48 h in differentiation media. Nuclear proteins were incubated with 32P-labeled TnI E-box probe, and protein-DNA complexes were separated through nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Autoradiography revealed a single MyoD∼E47 complex capable of binding the muscle E-box DNA probe (Fig. 6A). Coincubation of the nuclear extract with anti-hemagglutinin or anti-E47 caused a reduction in the mobility of the DNA binding complex, confirming the identity of the tethered protein. In a similar manner, nuclear extracts isolated from C2C12 myofibers expressing E47 demonstrated the presence of a single complex capable of binding the μE5 E-box DNA probe (Fig. 6B). Extracts from myoblasts co-expressing E47 and MEKK1Δ revealed the existence of a single E47 homodimer with efficient DNA binding capabilities. MEKK1-stimulated p38 Activity Targets the Amino Terminus of E47 to Inhibit Transcription—E47 protein is synthesized, localized to the nucleus, and retains its ability to contact DNA in the presence of sustained MEKK1 signal transduction. However, the protein fails to induce gene transcription. To examine the effects of MEKK1 on inherent E47 transcriptional activation, C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were transiently transfected with expression plasmids coding for MEKK1Δ and a fusion protein consisting of the yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4DB) and the amino terminus of E47 (amino acids 1–355) and a multimerized Gal4 DNA binding element reporter gene (pG5T-Luc). After 48 h in culture, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were measured. The 355 amino-terminal residues contain the two regions necessary for transcriptional activation (33Quong M.W. Massari M.E. Zwart R. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 792-800Google Scholar). As predicted, Gal4DB-E47-(1–355) stimulated activity of the luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 7A). Co-expression of the E47-TAD fusion protein with MEKK1Δ resulted in an approximate 70% reduction in reporter gene expression. Fibroblasts expressing Gal4DB-MyoD-(1–66) efficiently activated the Gal4 DNA binding site reporter gene irrespective of MEKK1Δ expression, arguing that the effects of MEKK1Δ on the E47 TAD are not a general phenomenon. Consistent with our prior results, treatment of the transfected cells with a chemical MEK inhibitor (PD98059) or chemical inhibitor of JNK (SP600125) did not restore transcriptional activity to the E47 fusion protein in the presence of MEKK1Δ (Fig. 7B). Unexpectedly, treatment of cells with SB202190, a p38 kinase inhibitor, completely removed the negative impact of MEKK1Δ on Gal4DB-E47-(1–355) function. The inhibitory actions of MEKK1 on the E47 fusion protein are specific to p38. Cotransfection of C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts with expression plasmids coding for Gal4DB-E47-(1–355), MEKK1Δ, and a kinase-deficient form of MKK6, an upstream activator of p38, prevented repression of E47 transcriptional activity (Fig. 7C). E47 Is Phosphorylated by p38 on a Residue outside of the TAD—To identify E47 as a target of p38 phosphorylation, in vitro kinase assays were performed. As shown in Fig. 8, GST, GST-ATF2-(1–96), and GST-E47 were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with [γ-32P]ATP and p38α or p38β. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 4× SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis, and label incorporation was measured by autoradiography. In the absence of enzyme, neither GST nor the fusion proteins incorporate 32P (data not shown). Consistent with published results (34Waas W.F. Lo H.H. Dalby K.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5676-5684Google Scholar, 35Ouwens D.M. De Ruiter N.D. van der Zon G.C. Carter A.P. Schouten J. van der B.C. Kooistra K. Bos J.L. Maassen J.A. van Dam H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3782-3793Google Scholar), GST-ATF2 is phosphorylated on threonines 69 and 71 by p38β and modestly phosphorylated by p38α. GST-E47 is phosphorylated equally well by both p38 isoforms with lower levels of phosphate incorporation when compared with GST-ATF2-(1–96). Analysis of the amino terminus of E47 for putative p38 phosphorylation sites reveals a minimum of nine phosphoacceptor sites. To test the significance of this region as a p38 target in vivo, C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were transiently transfected with expression plasmids coding for Gal4DB, Gal4DB-E47-(1–355), Gal4DB-E47-(271–582), MEKK1Δ, and the pG5T-Luc reporter gene plasmid. After 48 h, luciferase activities were measured on cell lysates. Gal4DB-E47-(271–582) contains the necessary TADs of E47 as well as the bHLH motif fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (33Quong M.W. Massari M.E. Zwart R. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 792-800Google Scholar). The fusion protein directs modest transcriptional activation from the multimerized reporter gene (Fig. 9A). Interestingly, co-expression of Gal4DB-E47-(271–582) with MEKK1Δ does not result in a loss of transcriptional activation. In vitro kinase assays using GST, GST-ATF2-(1–96), GST-E47-(271–582), and GST-E47-(1–355) indicate that p38β phosphorylates both chimeric E47 proteins (Fig. 9B). GST-E47-(271–582) is phosphorylated weakly when compared with GST-E47-(1–355). However, the putative p38 phosphorylation site contained with the minimal TAD-bHLH portion of E47 does not appear to inhibit the transcriptional activity of the protein.Fig. 9MEKK1Δ inhibition of E47 does not alter TAD function. A, C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were transiently transfected with Gal4, Gal4DB-E47-(1–355), or Gal4DB-E47-(271–582) and pcDNA or pcDNA-MEKK1Δ and the reporter plasmid, pG5T-Luc. pRL-tk was included to control for transfection efficiency. After 48 h, cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were measured. RLU, relative light units. B, GST, GST-ATF-(1–96), GST-E47-(1–366), and GST-E47-(271–582) were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and 25 ng of p38β for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling. Radiolabeled proteins were separated through 10% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by phosphorimaging.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) MEKK1 has been implicated as a negative regulator of skeletal myogenesis through a mechanism that remains to be identified (26Allen D.L. Leinwand L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45323-45330Google Scholar). The serine/threonine kinase participates in the MAPK signaling architecture as the initial kinase in the three-tiered system (10Schlesinger T.K. Fanger G.R. Yujiri T. Johnson G.L. Front Biosci. 1998; 3: D1181-D1186Google Scholar). Raf kinase shares a similar role in the prototypical MAPK activation scheme (36Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers G.T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Google Scholar). Moreover, Raf and MEKK1 physically associate within several cell types, suggesting that these two kinases may modify the actions of one another (22Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40120-40127Google Scholar). Previously, our group reported the ability of Raf kinase to inhibit myocyte formation through a MEK-independent mechanism (1Dorman C.M. Johnson S.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5167-5176Google Scholar, 6Wang X. Thomson S.R. Starkey J.D. Page J.L. Ealy A.D. Johnson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2528-2534Google Scholar). We proposed that Raf stimulation of MEKK1 may be responsible for the observed MEK-independent effects. Overexpression of dominant inhibitory forms of MEKK1 in Raf-expressing myoblasts did not relieve the repressive effects imposed by Raf. In a similar manner, kinase-defective Raf failed to reinstate the myogenic program to MEKK1-expressing myoblasts. Thus, we conclude that both Raf and MEKK1 inhibit muscle development through distinct, separable mechanisms. MEKK1 propagates downstream signal transduction through activation of MKK4, MKK6, and MEK1 in several cell types (10Schlesinger T.K. Fanger G.R. Yujiri T. Johnson G.L. Front Biosci. 1998; 3: D1181-D1186Google Scholar). The most common pathways activated by the multifunctional kinase are MKK4 and MEK1, leading to increased JNK and ERK1/2 activity, respectively. Phosphorylation events controlled by ERK1/2 and JNK are known to inhibit myoblast fusion and muscle gene expression (3Ramocki M.B. Johnson S.E. White M.A. Ashendel C.L. Konieczny S.F. Taparowsky E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3547-3555Google Scholar, 4Winter B. Arnold H.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4211-4220Google Scholar, 20Gallo R. Serafini M. Castellani L. Falcone G. Alema S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3137-3150Google Scholar, 21Meriane M. Roux P. Primig M. Fort P. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2513-2528Google Scholar, 27Kolodziejczyk S.M. Walsh G.S. Balazsi K. Seale P. Sandoz J. Hierlihy A.M. Rudnicki M.A. Chamberlain J.S. Miller F.D. Megeney L.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1278-1282Google Scholar, 37Jones N.C. Fedorov Y.V. Rosenthal R.S. Olwin B.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 186: 104-115Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, inhibition of either ERK1/2 or JNK in MEKK1 myoblasts did not restore myogenic capabilities. The myoblasts remained differentiation-defective as measured by both biochemical and morphological means. The inability to reverse the effects of MEKK1 is not due to the inappropriate use of inhibitors as these chemicals readily prevented the appearance of phosphoJNK and phosphoERK1/2 in myogenic cells. Moreover, overexpression of kinase-defective MEK1 and MKK4 failed to reinstate the differentiation program to MEKK1-expressing muscle cells (data not shown). These results argue that neither MEK/ERK nor MKK4/JNK signals are propagated in response to MEKK1 activity in myogenic cells. E47, the obligate dimer partner of the MRFs, represents a regulatory target of the MAPK pathways (38Bain G. Cravatt C.B. Loomans C. Alberola-Ila J. Hedrick S.M. Murre C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 165-171Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of E47 by ERK1/2 and JNK in T-cells causes ubiquitination of the protein and degradation through the 26 S proteasome (39Kho C.J. Huggins G.S. Endege W.O. Hsieh C.M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3845-3851Google Scholar, 40Nie L. Xu M. Vladimirova A. Sun X.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5780-5792Google Scholar). In skeletal myoblasts, elevated casein kinase II activity leads to a severe reduction in E47-directed transcriptional activity (41Johnson S.E. Wang X. Hardy S. Taparowsky E.J. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1604-1613Google Scholar). Thus, E47 modification in response to MEKK1 signaling may contribute to the defective myogenic program. Our data indicate that MEKK1 triggers p38 signaling that directly alters E47 function. The effects are attributed to p38 phosphorylation as E47 is a direct target in vitro and inhibition of the kinase reverses the transcriptional block imposed by MEKK1 in vivo. Moreover, the negative effects of MEKK1 on E47 are imparted on a region of the protein that does not contain either the TAD or the bHLH motif. In vitro kinase assays demonstrate that E47-(271–582), the region containing both the TAD and bHLH motifs, is phosphorylated weakly by p38β. The low level phosphate incorporation may reflect poor accessibility of the enzyme to the phosphoacceptor site. It is likely that the GST fusion protein exists in vitro as a homodimer through HLH interactions. This conformation may mask the optimal p38 phosphorylation sites. In turn, the residual incorporation found may be due to the phosphorylation of denatured GST-E47 protein molecules. However, it is apparent from the transient transfection experiments that p38 phosphorylation of E47-(271–582) does not disrupt the functional capabilities of the DNA binding motif or the TAD. These data support the existence of a novel mechanism for regulating E47 function in myoblasts that may include inhibiting additional protein:protein interactions that are necessary for optimal myogenesis. MEKK1 signaling through p38 represents a dichotomy of contrasting effects on myogenesis. Several groups have demonstrated that treatment of myogenic cultures with a p38 inhibitor prevents myoblast fusion and muscle gene activation, clearly arguing that the kinase is a requisite for differentiation (42Cuenda A. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4341-4346Google Scholar, 43Puri P.L. Wu Z. Zhang P. Wood L.D. Bhakta K.S. Han J. Feramisco J.R. Karin M. Wang J.Y.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5193-5200Google Scholar). Recently, Suelves et al. (46Suelves M. Lluis F. Ruiz V. Nebreda A.R. Munoz-Canoves P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 365-375Google Scholar) reported that p38 phosphorylation of the MRF4 TAD is inhibitory to muscle gene expression. The authors present evidence for a regulatory pathway whereby phosphorylation and inactivation of MRF4 by p38 lead to differential muscle gene expression. In this manner, subsets of muscle genes are expressed at varying times during development. We propose a similar model involving the phosphorylation of E47 and subsequent differential inactivation of heterodimeric complexes. In our model, the early MRF, MyoD, acts predominantly as a homodimer in muscle cells to regulate the transcription of specific sets of contractile genes. MyoD homodimers are the predominant multiplex in C2C12 myoblasts (28Li F.Q. Coonrod A. Horwitz M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1043-1057Google Scholar, 47Becker J.R. Dorman C.M. McClafferty T.M. Johnson S.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 135-143Google Scholar). Moreover, the presence of MyoD-MyoD transcriptional units is further supported by the inability of MEKK1Δ to disrupt MyoD-directed transcription from a minimal muscle E-box reporter (Fig. 2). In the immature myocyte, phosphorylation of E47 by p38 leads to the inactivation of MyoD-E47 heterodimers, thereby preventing precocious differentiation. As myogenesis proceeds, myofibers are formed in response to the p38-induced up-regulation of myogenin gene expression (45Zetser A. Gredinger E. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5193-5200Google Scholar). The validity of this model remains to be tested. In summary, MEKK1 signaling is inhibitory to skeletal myogenesis through a mechanism that is independent of downstream induction of JNK or MEK activities. Overexpression of MEKK1 in myoblasts leads to increased p38 activity that disrupts E47 and MyoD∼E47 function. E47 is an in vitro target of p38 phosphorylation, and modification of the protein likely occurs outside of the bHLH or TAD motifs. Future efforts will focus on the identification of proteins that physically associate with the amino terminus of E47 and impair transcriptional activation.

Possible participation of loop 38–52 in this communication has recently been questioned based on unimpaired Ca2+ regulation of myosin interaction, in the presence of the tropomyosin-troponin complex, with actin cleaved by subtilisin between Met47 and Gly48. We have compared the effects of actin cleavage by subtilisin and by protease ECP32, between Gly42 and Val43, on its interaction with myosin S1 in the presence and absence of tropomyosin or tropomyosin-troponin. Both individual modifications reduced activation of S1 ATPase by actin to a similar extent. The effect of ECP cleavage, but not of subtilisin cleavage, was partially reversed by stabilization of interprotomer contacts with phalloidin, indicating different pathways of signal transmission from the N- and C-terminal parts of loop 38–52 to myosin binding sites. ECP cleavage diminished the affinity to tropomyosin and reduced its inhibition of acto-S1 ATPase at low S1 concentrations, but increased the tropomyosin-mediated cooperative enhancement of the ATPase by S1 binding to actin. These effects were reversed by phalloidin. Subtilisin-cleaved actin more closely resembled unmodified actin than the ECP-modified actin. Limited proteolysis of the modified and unmodified F-actins revealed an allosteric effect of ECP cleavage on the conformation of the actin subdomain 4 region that is presumably involved in tropomyosin binding. Our results point to a possible role of the N-terminal part of loop 38–52 of actin in communication between tropomyosin and myosin through changes in actin structure.

It is now generally accepted that the regulation of vertebrate striated muscle contraction involves cooperative and allosteric interactions between actin, myosin, tropomyosin (Tm), 1The abbreviations used are: Tm, tropomyosin; Tn, troponin; S1, myosin subfragment 1; ECP, proteinase ECP32 from E. coli A2 strain; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: Tm, tropomyosin; Tn, troponin; S1, myosin subfragment 1; ECP, proteinase ECP32 from E. coli A2 strain; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. and troponin (Tn). Positive cooperativity of actin-myosin interactions in the presence of regulatory proteins is indicated by sigmoidal profiles of both the binding of the myosin heads to the thin filament (1Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2616-2620Google Scholar) and the actin-activated ATPase plotted as a function of myosin concentration (2Lehrer S.S. Morris E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8073-8080Google Scholar). This behavior, for which the binding of Tm to actin is a necessary and sufficient requirement, has led to a modification of the classic steric blocking hypothesis of the regulation of striated muscle contraction. Based on equilibrium binding studies in solution, Hill et al. (3Hill T.L. Eisenberg E. Greene L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3186-3190Google Scholar) suggested that seven actin monomers together with one molecule of Tm and one of Tn form a functional unit that exists in equilibrium between two states, inactivated and activated; the latter having higher binding affinity for Ca2+ and for myosin or its subfragment 1 (S1). Subsequent kinetic studies have led McKillop and Geeves to a three-state model (4McKillop D.F.A. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Google Scholar) in which the kinetics of S1 binding to the regulated actin filament is closely coupled to the two-step mechanism of S1 binding to actin alone (5Trybus K.M. Taylor E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7209-7213Google Scholar, 6Geeves M.A. Goody R.S. Gutfreund H. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1984; 5: 351-361Google Scholar). In this model, removal of calcium converts the actin-Tm-Tn units to a state unable to bind S1 (blocked state). Actin-Tm as well as actin-Tm-Tn with Ca2+ bound to troponin are in a state that permits weak binding of S1 (closed state, no acceleration of ATPase rate) in equilibrium with a third, fully active state (open state) that allows isomerization of the weakly bound S1 to the strongly bound, rigor-like state. The ratio of open/closed thin filament cooperative units depends on the fraction of actin sites occupied by S1, because occupancy of the actin filament with strongly bound S1 stabilizes the open state. These three biochemical states can be related to three distinct positions of the Tm-Tn complex on the actin filament (7Holmes K.C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2s-7sGoogle Scholar, 8Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Google Scholar, 9Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 1027-1036Google Scholar). One should emphasize that states analogous to the blocked, closed, and open state are also present in the Hill model as substates of the two major states, but the incapability of thin filament to bind S1 in the absence of Ca2+ postulated in the McKillop and Geeves model is a matter of dispute (10Chen Y.-D. Yan B. Chalovich J.M. Brenner B. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2338-2349Google Scholar, 11Geeves M.A. Lehrer S.S. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1677-1679Google Scholar, 12Chalovich J.M. Yan B. Brenner B. Chen Y.-D. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1676-1681Google Scholar, 13Resetar A.M. Stephens J.M. Chalovich J.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1039-1049Google Scholar). Both models assume that the cooperativity of Tm and S1 binding to actin depend on the strength of end-to-end interactions between adjacent Tm molecules. Strong end-to-end contacts between Tm molecules are also the basic requirement in the more recent view that points to the role of flexibility of Tm strands in determination of the apparent cooperative unit size (14Lehrer S.S. Golitsina N.L. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13449-13454Google Scholar, 15Maytum R. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1102-1110Google Scholar, 16Smith D. Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 3155-3167Google Scholar). However, Tm with impaired end-to-end interactions still bind cooperatively to actin, suggesting that the cooperativity involves tropomyosin-promoted conformational changes within the actin polymer (16Smith D. Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 3155-3167Google Scholar, 17Dąbrowska R. Nowak E. Drabikowski W. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 143-161Google Scholar, 18Heald R.W.

A putative myosin- and Tm-induced conformational change in actin has been incorporated in the more recent models of cooperative myosin binding and activation of muscle contraction (22Tobacman L.S. Butters C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27587-27593Google Scholar, 23Strand J. Nili M. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34832-34839Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence point to a possible role of subdomain 2 of actin in transmission of cooperative changes between actin protomers in thin filaments. This subdomain, and in particular its DNase-I binding loop (residues 38–52), are the most dynamic elements of the actin filament structure. Their conformational transitions strongly influence the interprotomer interactions along the filament (24Egelman E.H. Orlova A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 172-180Google Scholar, 25Sablin E.P. Dawson J.F. VanLoock M.S. Spudich J.A. Egelman E.H. Fletterick R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10945-10947Google Scholar), consistent with participation of loop 38–52 in these interactions (Refs. 26Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Google Scholar and 27Kim E. Wriggers W. Phillips M. Kokabi K. Rubenstein P.A. Reisler E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 421-429Google Scholar and references therein). Inhibition of actin motion over myosin in the in vitro motility assays by interprotomer cross-linking of actin filaments between various residues revealed the importance of conformational freedom of the subdomain 2/subdomain 1 interface for generation of motion and force with myosin (28Kim E. Bobkova E. Miller C.J. Orlova A. Hegyi G. Egelman E.H. Muhlrad A. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17801-17809Google Scholar, 29Kim E. Bobkova E. Hegyi G. Muhlrad A. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 86-93Google Scholar). In vitro motility of actin filaments is also inhibited by subtilisin cleavage within loop 38–52 (30Schwyter D.H. Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Spudich J.A. Reisler E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 465-470Google Scholar). Mutations D56A/E57A within subdomain 2 of yeast actin were shown to alter the affinity of this actin for both Tm and myosin S1 and impair thin filament regulation by Ca2+ without tethering Tm in position blocking the myosin binding sites in subdomain 1 (31Korman V.L. Hatch V. Dixon K.Y. Craig R. Lehman W. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22470-22478Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction patterns of oriented F-actin gels revealed a small radial shift of loop 38–52 on Tm binding to actin (32Lorenz M. Poole K.J.V. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Google Scholar), and possible contribution of subdomain 2 movements within actin protomers to changes in x-ray diffraction patterns from muscle in response to Ca2+ activation of thin filament has been discussed (33Squire J.M. Morris E.P. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 761-771Google Scholar). On the other hand, fluorescence studies on both muscle actin and yeast actin mutants with probes on residues 41 or 51 indicated that transitions among the blocked, closed, and open regulatory states involve no significant subdomain 2 movement (34Gerson J.H. Kim E. Muhlrad A. Reisler E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18442-18449Google Scholar). A most recent study of effects of the regulatory proteins on the affinity for myosin S1 and in vitro motility of subtilisin-cleaved actin has also led to the conclusion that subdomain 2 conformation does not play an active role in the regulation of actomyosin interactions (35Pavlov D. Gerson J.H. Yu T. Tobacman L.S. Homsher E. Reisler E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5517-5522Google Scholar). We have previously shown that proteolytic cleavage of the DNase-I binding loop of actin between Gly42 and Val43 with protease ECP32 from Escherichia coli A2 strain has a profound effect on the interprotomer interactions in F-actin, whereas subtilisin cleavage between Met47 and Gly48 has not (36Khaitlina S.Yu. Strzelecka-Gołaszewska H. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 321-334Google Scholar). This prompted us to compare the effects of these modifications on the Tm-mediated cooperativity of myosin S1-actin interactions. The results of this investigation support the conclusion that modification of the C-terminal portion of loop 38–52 by subtilisin cleavage does not substantially influence the regulation of actin-myosin interaction. In contrast, modification of the N-terminal part of this loop generated substantial changes in Tm binding to actin, its inhibitory effect on acto-S1 ATPase at low S1 concentrations, and the cooperative, Tm-mediated potentiation of the ATPase by the initial S1 binding. This is the first indication that changes at the intermolecular interface of the DNase-I binding loop may play a role in the regulation of muscle contraction. A preliminary report of this work has been presented (37Moraczewska J. Gruszczyńska-Biegała J. Rędowicz M.J. Strzelecka-Gołaszewska H. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 246aGoogle Scholar). Reagents—The protease ECP32 from E. coli A2 strain was kindly provided by Dr. A. Morozova (Institute of Cytology, St. Petersburg, Russia). Subtilisin (Carlsberg, from Bacillus licheniformis), ATP, Hepes, MOPS, dithiothreitol, were from Sigma, N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), Sephadex G-100 was from Amersham Biosciences, and SP-Trisacryl M was from Biosepra (Sergy-Saint-Christophe, France). Protein Preparations—Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscles and purified according to Ref. 38Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Google Scholar. It was stored in the form of G-actin in buffer containing 2 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.02% NaN3 (buffer G). Labeling of actin with N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide at Cys374 was performed as described previously (39Khaitlina S.Yu. Moraczewska J. Strzelecka-Gołaszewska H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 911-920Google Scholar) with an additional step of gel filtration of labeled G-actin on a Sephadex G-100 column. Actin cleaved between residues 47 and 48 with subtilisin was prepared as described by Schwyter et al. (40Schwyter D. Phillips M. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5889-5895Google Scholar) except that the digestion was carried out at actin concentrations of about 2 mg ml–1 at an enzyme to actin mass ratio of 1:1500. The cleaved actin was subjected to one polymerization-depolymerization cycle and was stored in buffer G for up to 2 days. G-actin cleaved between residues 42 and 43 was obtained by a 1–2 h cleavage with partially purified ECP32 at 25 °C (41Khaitlina S.Yu. Collins J.H. Kuznetsova I.M. Pershina V.P. Synakevich I.G. Turoverov K.K. Usmanova A.M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 49-51Google Scholar). Precise conditions of the reaction (quantity of the enzyme, time of digestion) were established for each batch of the enzyme by examining the extent of actin cleavage with the use of SDS-PAGE. The cleaved actin was used within 10–12 h. The G-actins were transformed into Mg-bound form by 3–5-min incubations with 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm MgCl2 at 25 °C and polymerized with 0.1 m NaCl directly before measurements. Myosin from rabbit fast skeletal muscle longissimus dorsi and its S1 were prepared as described in Ref. 42Margossian S.S. Lowey S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 55-71Google Scholar. S1 fractionation into S1(A1) and S1(A2) isoenzymes was performed by ion-exchange chromatography on SP-Trisacryl M (43Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5718-5727Google Scholar). Before use, samples of S1 were clarified by centrifugation at 300,000 × g for 30 min. Rabbit skeletal muscle α,β-tropomyosin and troponin were prepared as described in Refs. 44Smillie L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 234-241Google Scholar and 45Potter J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 241-263Google Scholar, respectively. Labeling of Tm with N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide at Cys190 was performed as described by Ishii and Lehrer (46Ishii Y. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1160-1166Google Scholar). The labeling ratio of pyrene to Tm in preparations used throughout this work was in the range of 1.3–1.5, indicating that a significant fraction of the molecules was double-labeled. Purity of all protein preparations was controlled by SDS-PAGE according to Ref. 47Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar. The concentrations of proteins were determined spectrophotometrically by using the following absorption coefficients and molecular masses: 0.63 mg ml–1 cm–1 at 290 nm and 42,000 for G-actin, 0.75 mg ml–1 cm–1 at 280 nm and 115,000 for S1, 0.33 mg ml–1 cm–1 at 280 nm and 66,000 for Tm, and 0.45 mg ml–1 cm–1 at 280 nm and 69,000 daltons for Tn. The concentration of pyrene-labeled Tm was determined by the method of Bradford (48Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 64: 215-218Google Scholar). Determination of Critical Concentration for Polymerization (Cc) of the Modified Actins—In view of the enhancement of actin Cc by both ECP and subtilisin cleavage (39Khaitlina S.Yu. Moraczewska J. Strzelecka-Gołaszewska H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 911-920Google Scholar, 40Schwyter D. Phillips M. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5889-5895Google Scholar), it was necessary to determine the Cc values for these actins under the ionic conditions of our experiments. About 70 μm Ca-G-actins containing 10% of the respective pyrenyl-labeled actin (in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.02% NaN3) were transformed into Mg-G-actins and polymerized with 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2 for 45 min. The F-actin solutions were twice diluted with a solution of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm ATP, 20 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2 without and, in a parallel sample, with tropomyosin added at a 1:4 molar ratio to actin. After 30 min, the solutions were diluted with the same buffer-salt solution to various actin concentrations in the range from 1 to 10 μm, and the intensity of pyrenyl fluorescence was measured after 2 h and again after 24 h, at 25 °C. From plots of the difference in the fluorescence intensities between the F-actin and G-actin samples diluted to the same final concentrations versus actin concentration, the Cc values were calculated to be 0.5 μm for subtilisin-cleaved and 4 μm for ECP-cleaved actin both in the presence and absence of Tm. ATPase Activity Measurements—The MgATPase activity of S1 and acto-S1 was measured in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2, or 0.2 mm EGTA, at 25 °C. The reaction was started by adding MgATP to 2 mm final concentration and terminated with 2.5% SDS. The released phosphate was determined according to Ref. 49Fiske C.H. Subba-Row Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Google Scholar. Spectroscopic Measurements—Fluorescence and light-scattering measurements were carried out in a Spex Fluorolog 3 spectrofluorometer in the ratio mode. Fluorescence emission spectra of pyrene-Tm were registered after excitation at 340 nm, and the excimer fluorescence was measured at 489 nm after excitation at 340 nm. Fluorescence intensity of pyrene-actin was measured at 407 nm after excitation at 365 nm. Intensity of light scattered at 90° was measured at 350 nm. Probing the Conformation of F-actins by Limited Digestion with Subtilisin—F-actins, obtained by polymerization of Mg-G-actins with 0.1 m KCl, were digested with subtilisin at an enzyme/protein mass ratio of 1:20 at 25 °C. At different time intervals, aliquots of the solutions were withdrawn, and the reaction was stopped with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The digests were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel slabs according to Ref. 47Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar. The apparent molecular masses of actin fragments were calculated from standard curves obtained with Bio-Rad SDS-PAGE standards. Effects of Proteolytic Modifications of Actin on F-actin-Tm Interaction—Possible changes in F-actin-Tm binding induced by proteolytic modifications of actin could not be examined by standard methods of analyzing the binding of protein ligands to F-actin, such as sedimentation, because the instability of ECP-cleaved F-actin results in disruption of its filaments by ultracentrifugal forces (39Khaitlina S.Yu. Moraczewska J. Strzelecka-Gołaszewska H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 911-920Google Scholar). It is a common practice to overcome problems arising from instability of F-actin, e.g. in experiments that require low F-actin concentrations, by taking the measurements in the presence of phalloidin, a toxin known to decrease Cc of actin and stabilize F-actin filaments. This procedure is inapplicable to ECP-cleaved actin because, as will be shown below, phalloidin binding produces substantial changes not only in the filament stability but also in other properties of such modified F-actin. Therefore, to evaluate the effects of the proteolytic modifications of actin on F-actin interaction with Tm, we resorted to measuring F-actin-induced changes in the fluorescence of pyrene-Tm. As shown in Fig. 1, both subtilisin-cleaved and ECP-cleaved F-actin retain the ability of intact actin to increase the intensity of monomer fluorescence (two peaks centered at 385 and 405 nm) and decrease the intensity of excimer fluorescence (maximum at 485 nm) of N-(1-pyrenyl)-acetamide label attached to Cys190 of Tm (46Ishii Y. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1160-1166Google Scholar). Fluorescence titrations of pyrene-Tm with F-actins showed that the final change in the excimer fluorescence of double-labeled Tm was similar for the three actins (about 40% quenching). However, as shown in Fig. 2, saturation of the fluorescence change with ECP-cleaved actin required about 3-fold higher F-actin concentration than the saturation with intact actin that was reached at about 7 mol per mol of Tm, indicating that cleavage at Gly42 weakens Tm to F-actin binding. The titration curve for subtilisin-cleaved actin closely followed that for intact actin.Fig. 2Binding of Tm to F-actin monitored by a change in the excimer fluorescence of double-labeled pyrene-Tm. Conditions: 0.7 μm pyrene-Tm, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15–50 μm ATP, 32 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and unmodified (○), subtilisin-cleaved (□), or ECP-cleaved F-actin (▵) at the concentrations indicated on the abscissa. Representative data from one of four experiments are shown. The concentrations of ECP-cleaved and subtilisin-cleaved F-actins are corrected for the presence of the monomeric species with an assumption that F-actin diluted into Tm solution, with Tm in excess over actin, is protected from depolymerization by fast Tm binding. The fluorescence intensity after each addition of actin was measured at 489 nm after excitation at 340 nm, at 25 °C. The fluorescence intensities in the absence of actin and at saturation with F-actin were normalized to 1.0 and to 0, respectively. Inset, fluorescence fractional change versus concentration of Tm-free F-actin calculated as described in the text. The curves fitting the data were calculated using the Hill equation (see “Results”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Assuming that the 7:1 stoichiometry of actin to Tm binding is preserved, and the fluorescence change is proportional to the fraction of maximal number of actins bound per Tm molecule, the free F-actin concentrations at any F-actin to Tm ratio can be obtained as a difference between concentration of total F-actin and F-actin bound calculated from the fractional fluorescence change. From the plots of the fractional fluorescence change versus free F-actin concentration (Fig. 2, inset), estimates of the apparent association constants (Kapp) were obtained by fitting the data to a Hill equation in the form shown in Equation 1, υ=n[A]αHKappαH/(1+[A]αHKappαH)(Eq. 1) where v = fraction of maximal actin binding to Tm = fractional fluorescence change, n = number of actin binding sites on Tm = 7, [A] = free F-actin concentration, and αH is the Hill coefficient. The best fit for ECP-cleaved actin was obtained with Kapp = 1.5 × 105m–1 and αH of 1.2. The Kapp value of 5 × 106m–1 obtained for intact actin (with αH = 1.0) from cumulated data points from four experiments is only an approximation because the tight binding of the two proteins precludes accurate calculation of free F-actin concentrations below the saturating F-actin concentration. Nevertheless, this value is in good agreement with the values obtained in other laboratories using different methods (17Dąbrowska R. Nowak E. Drabikowski W. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 143-161Google Scholar, 18Heald R.W. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5254-5259Google Scholar, 50Yang Y. Korn E.D. Eisenberg E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24310-24315Google Scholar). It is to be noted that the cooperativity of Tm to actin binding, observed when actin is in excess (common approach), is not experimentally detectable (the Hill coefficient equal to or close to 1.0) in our type of measurements (Tm in excess). Thin Filament Cooperativity Probed by Acto-S1 ATPase Measurements—Fig. 3 shows S1 concentration dependence of actin-activated S1 ATPase at a constant F-actin concentration. The enhancement of actin critical concentration for polymerization by subtilisin and ECP cleavage (see “Materials and Methods”) was compensated for by correspondingly increasing the total concentration of the modified actins. One can see that at the low F-actin and S1 concentrations used in these measurements (activity far from Vmax), the dependence of acto-S1 ATPase on [S1] in the absence of regulatory proteins was linear with both intact and the modified actins. In agreement with an enhancement of Kapp for this reaction upon subtilisin cleavage of actin (40Schwyter D. Phillips M. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5889-5895Google Scholar), activation of S1 by subtilisin-cleaved actin was an order of magnitude lower relative to intact actin. A similar decrease in actin-activated ATPase was produced by ECP cleavage. Effects of the two modifications of actin on the S1 concentration dependence of acto-S1 ATPase in the presence of the regulatory proteins were however different. Subtilisin cleavage had no significant influence on the pattern of changes in the ATPase activity with increasing S1 concentrations. With ECP-modified actin, the transition from inhibition of the ATPase relative to that with F-actin alone at low S1 to activation at high S1 concentrations (Ref. 2Lehrer S.S. Morris E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8073-8080Google Scholar and references therein) took place at severalfold lower [S1] than with intact and subtilisin-cleaved actin. This shift could not be caused by possible increases in the concentration of ECP-modified F-actin with increasing S1 concentrations arising from S1-induced polymerization of the monomeric species present in the assay mixtures. If that were the case, a departure of the data from the linear dependence on [S1] would be also observed with actin alone. Moreover, no significant activation of S1 ATPase by ECP-cleaved actin was observed at its concentrations below 4 μm (see Fig. 5), the critical concentration for polymerization of this actin under ionic conditions of our experiments. Thus, the data in Fig. 3 indicate greater cooperativity of the filaments of ECP-modified actin relative to those of intact or subtilisin-cleaved actin.Fig. 5Effect of phalloidin on Tm-dependent changes in the profile of acto-S1 ATPase versus [S1] for ECP-cleaved actin. The MgATPase activities of myosin S1(A1) at the concentrations indicated on the abscissa were measured in the presence of ECP-cleaved actin at the total concentration of 8 μm, alone (empty symbols) or combined with 2 μm Tm (filled symbols), that had been polymerized in the absence (▿, ▾) or in the presence of 1.5 equivalents of phalloidin (▵, ▴). Other conditions are described in the legend to Fig. 3. The ATPase activity of S1 alone has been subtracted from all points.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In complementary experiments, the inhibition of acto-S1 ATPase by Tm at low ionic strength (10 mm NaCl, MgCl2 in a 2 mm excess over ATP) and low S1 to actin molar ratio of 1:6 was measured as a function of Tm concentration. In agreement with earlier reports (53Eaton B.L. Kominz D.R. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2718-2725Google Scholar, 54Williams Jr., D.L. Green L.E. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4150-4155Google Scholar), with intact actin the maximal inhibition, reached at the stoichiometric ratio of one Tm per seven actin monomers, amounted to about 70% of the activity of unregulated acto-S1. Similar results were obtained with subtilisin-cleaved actin. With ECP-cleaved actin, the maximal inhibitory effect of Tm was reduced to only about 20% of the ATPase with actin alone (data not shown). The greater cooperativity of actin-myosin interaction is also reflected in the higher degree of the regulation of ECP-modified F-actin by Ca2+ in the presence of Tm-Tn at S1 concentrations exc"

Although both enzymes prefer Arg at P1 and basic residues at P2, the two differ in recognition of P4 and P6 residues. To probe P4 and P6 recognition by Kex2p, furin-like substitutions were made in the putative S4 and S6 subsites of Kex2. T252D and Q283E mutations were introduced to increase the preference for Arg at P4 and P6, respectively. Glu255 was replaced with Ile to limit recognition of P4 Arg. The effects of putative S4 and S6 mutations were determined by examining the cleavage by purified mutant enzymes of a series of fluorogenic substrates with systematic changes in P4 and/or P6. Whereas wild Kex2 exhibited little preference type for Arg at P6, the T252D mutant and T252D/Q283E double mutant exhibited clear interactions with P6 Arg. Moreover, the T252D and T252D/Q283E substitutions altered the influence of the P6 residue on P4 recognition. We infer that cross-talk between S4 and S6, not seen in furin, allows wild type and mutant forms of Kex2 to adapt their subsites for altered modes of recognition. This apparent plasticity may allow the subsites to rearrange their local environment to interact with different substrates in a productive manner. E255I-Kex2 exhibited significantly decreased recognition of P4 Arg in a tetrapeptide substrate with Lys at P1, although the general pattern of selectivity for aliphatic residues at P4 remained unchanged.

The subtilisin superfamily includes a subfamily of related processing proteases, the proprotein convertases that function in the late secretory pathway of diverse eukaryotic organisms including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and mammals (1Julius D.

Breddam K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6011-6018Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the proprotein convertases are post-translational modifying enzymes that process secretory proteins in a sequence-specific manner. In general, these proteases cleave C-terminal to clusters of basic residues, but their exact sequence specificity differs among the members of this family, even though they are ≥45% identical within their subtilisin-related domains. Similarities and differences in substrate recognition were illustrated by the enzymatic characterization of two members of this family, the S. cerevisiae protease, Kex2, and the human homologue, furin. A detailed understanding of substrate recognition by Kex2 and furin has emerged from extensive analysis of the purified secreted, soluble enzymes using model peptide substrates. Based on these studies, the consensus cleavage site for Kex2 was determined to be (Ali/Arg)-Xaa-(Lys/Arg)-Arg↓ (where Ali indicates an aliphatic amino acid), with the principal determinants being a basic residue at P2 and Arg at P1 (6Schecter I.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and resulted in a change in the rate-limiting step from deacylation to acylation (10Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S.

Kex2 exhibits a less stringent preference at P4, with a dual specificity for either a basic or an aliphatic residue (10Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furin also exhibits a strict requirement for Arg at P1, but, unlike Kex2, it has reduced selectivity for P2 and increased dependence on P4 recognition (13Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Krysan D.J. Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. J. Biol.

Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23229-23234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Kex2 and furin also differ in P6 recognition. Furin exhibited a 10-fold preference for Arg versus Ala at P6 (14Krysan D.J. Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23229-23234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of a basic residue at P6 can partially compensate for the lack of Arg at P4 (14Krysan D.J. Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. J. Biol.

VanSlyke J.K. Thulin C.D. Jean F. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). An examination of physiological Kex2 substrates does not indicate any obvious P6 selectivity, and in experiments with peptide substrates, Kex2 exhibits only a 2-fold preference for Arg at P6 (14Krysan D.J. Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23229-23234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This difference in P6 recognition was also observed in interactions with derivatives of eglin-c that had been engineered to be potent inhibitors of Kex2 and furin (19Komiyama T. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15156-15165Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Kex2 exhibited only a slightly higher (∼3-fold) affinity for Arg (as opposed to Gly) at P6 in an eglin-c variant having Arg at P1 and P4 (19Komiyama T. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15156-15165Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, this same substitution of Arg for Gly at P6 had a striking qualitative effect on the interaction of the inhibitor with furin, in that it caused the eglin-c variant to be cleaved. This result implies that the mode of P6 recognition also is fundamentally different between Kex2 and furin, suggesting that, unlike Kex2, furin has a well defined S6 subsite. Crystal structures of subtilisin-inhibitor complexes, such as that of subtilisin bound to Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor, illustrate that the principal residues in subtilisin BPN′ that contact P4 are Tyr104 and Ile107 (20Takeuchi Y. Satow Y. Nakamura K.T. Mitsui Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 309-325PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these structural studies, several groups have mutated the S4 pocket in an attempt to alter the P4 substrate specificity of subtilisin (21Bech L.M. Sorensen S.B. Breddam K. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13579-13585Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) found that substitutions of Asp for Tyr104 in subtilisin BPN′ increased cleavage of substrates containing a P4 Arg, but the resulting mutant protease did not discriminate between Arg and Phe at this position. In another study, acidic residues in furin predicted to interact with P4 were mutated, and the mutant furin enzymes were co-transfected with a furin substrate, pro-von Willebrand factor. Substitution of Val for Asp233 in furin, at a position equivalent to Tyr104 in subtilisin, resulted in an enzyme that cleaved pro-von Willebrand factor with Ala at P4 better than the wild type (WT) substrate (29Creemers J.W.M.

In this work, the differences in substrate recognition by the S4 and S6 subsites of Kex2 and furin were explored by mutagenesis. Residues predicted to contribute to the specificity of P4 and P6 binding and that were different in Kex2 and furin were mutated in the yeast enzyme, and the substrate specificity of the mutants was analyzed. Substitutions in Kex2 were chosen prior to the availability of crystallographic data for Kex2 or furin and thus were based on examination of three-dimensional structures of subtilisins and the amino acid sequences and structural models of Kex2 and furin (20Takeuchi Y.

One group of mutations was generated with the goal of making Kex2 specificity more furin-like, by increasing selectivity for basic residues at P4 and for Arg at P6. In addition, the model for the dual specificity of the S4 subsite was tested by making a Kex2 mutant that was predicted to exhibit reduced recognition for basic residues at P4 while retaining selectivity for aliphatic P4 residues. Recently, the x-ray crystal structures were solved of the Kex2 catalytic domain complexed with tripeptidyl and tetrapeptidyl boronic acid inhibitors and of the furin catalytic domain complexed with a tetrapeptidyl chloromethylketone (34Henrich S.

Through the comparison of the P4-S4 interactions in Kex2 and furin, the structures have allowed us to interpret the results of these mutagenesis experiments with greater clarity. The biochemical data presented here will be discussed in light of the crystallographic structures.

Site-directed Mutagenesis—All of the mutations were made by overlap extension (37Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar). The following primers were used to make point mutations: (i) T252D, GGTGATATTACTGACGAAGATGA (sense) and TCATCTTCGTCCGTAATATCACC (antisense); (ii) E255I, CGGAAGATRTRGCTGCTAGCTTGATTTA (sense) and TAAATCAAGCTAGCAGCYAYATCTTCCG (antisense); (iii) Q283E, GGAAGACATTTAGAAGGCCCTAG (sense) and CTAGGCCCTTCTAAATGTCTTCC (antisense); and (iv) V289A, GTGACCTGGCCAAAAAGGC (sense) and GCCTTTTTGGCCAGGTCAC (antisense). The template for all single mutations was pAL7, (38.Bevan, A. (1997) Structural Determinants of Protease Specificity. Ph.D. thesis, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CAGoogle Scholar) a pRS314-based vector encoding the full-length KEX2 gene with an additional XhoI site downstream of the P-domain (39Gluschankof P. Fuller R.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2280-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and its expression was regulated by its WT promoter. Q283E-Kex2 served as a PCR template for creation of the T252D/Q283E-Kex2 double mutant. PCR products were subcloned into pAL7as HindIII to BglII fragments, and the incorporation of each mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing (University of Michigan DNA sequencing core). Expression and Purification of Mutants—The substituted Kex2 DNAs were recombined with a linearized expression vector for the production of secreted, soluble Kex2 mutants. The general method was described in Ref. 40Brenner C. Bevan A. Fuller R.S. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 498-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar. Briefly, the expression vector pAL10 was a derivative of the secreted, soluble Kex2 expression plasmid, pG5KEX2Δ613 (9Brenner C. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), in which a XhoI site was inserted in place of internal KEX2 sequences from a point 370 nucleotides downstream from the start codon to a point 1788 nucleotides downstream from the start codon, just 3′ to sequences encoding the P-domain. pAL7 vectors encoding the Kex2 mutants were linearized with BamHI and co-transformed into CBO17 with XhoI-digested pAL10. Transformants containing recombinant plasmids and thus encoding mutant-secreted, soluble Kex2 were selected on synthetic dextrose complete-Ura plates. Individual colonies were grown overnight in synthetic dextrose complete-Ura liquid medium and then inoculated into 1040 expression medium (41Brenner C. Bevan A. Fuller R.S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 152-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After growth at 30 °C for 24 h, the medium was checked for activity. Equal amounts of medium and substrate solution (140 μm BocQRR↓MCA, 400 mm BisTris, 2 mm CaCl2) were mixed in wells of a 96-well plate and release of the fluorogenic reporter was determined using a Molecular Devices fmax fluorescence plate reader. The cell cultures secreting active enzyme were reinoculated into fresh medium and incubated for 24 h at 30 °C. The enzymes were purified as described (9Brenner C. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Mutation of Kex2 to Alter Recognition of Basic Residues at P4 and P6—To increase recognition of basic side chains at P4 and P6, putative S4 and S6 residues were selected by comparison of Kex2 and furin sequence alignments and model structures as well as on results of previous mutagenesis experiments (24Rheinnecker M.

Substitution of Asp for Thr252 in Kex2, a position equivalent to S4 residue Tyr104 in subtilisin BPN′ and Asp233 in furin, was originally introduced to increase recognition of basic versus aliphatic residues at P4 (Figs. 1 and 2). Because substitutions at this position in both subtilisin and furin exhibited significant alterations in their P4 specificities, this residue was also considered a good candidate for tuning the P4 specificity of Kex2 (24Rheinnecker M. Eder J. Pandey P.S. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Ballinger M.D. Tom J. Wells J.A.

The S6 subsite was more difficult to model because the degradative subtilisins described to date do not have a distinct binding pocket for P6, but Seizen et al. (32Seizen R.J. Creemers J.W.M. Van de Ven J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) tentatively assigned an insertion loop, with respect to subtilisin, in furin to form the S6 subsite. Only very recently, the crystallographic data for Kex2 clarified the structure of this insertion (see “Discussion”). Within this region, furin has Asp at amino acid 264, equivalent to Gln283 in Kex2 (Figs. 1 and 2). Gln283 was mutated to a Glu to mimic the charge at that position in furin while minimizing the change in geometry in the binding site. Glu at this position was expected to be well tolerated as it is also found in PC1/3 (33Seizen R.J. Leunissen J.A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The T252D/Q283E double mutant was constructed to determine whether this would result in a Kex2 mutant with furin-like specificity at P4 and P6. Finally, to decrease recognition of basic residues at P4 while maintaining interactions with aliphatic side chains, Ile was substituted for Glu255, a potential site of interaction with basic residues equivalent to Ile107 in subtilisin and Glu236 in furin.Fig. 2Crystal structure of Kex2 depicting the location of the substituted residues. The mutated residues in this work, Thr252, Glu255, and Gln283, are highlighted in this depiction of Kex2 crystallized with the Ac-Ala-Lys-Arg-boronic acid inhibitor (Protein Data Bank identification code PDB1OT5) (36Holyoak T.W.M.

In fact, using the model substrates Ac-βYKR↓MCA 2The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; Nle or β, norleucine; π, norvaline; χ, cyclohexylalanine; MCA, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. and Ac-RYKR↓MCA, Kex2 exhibited a 3-fold preference for the P4 Arg substrate (see Table I) (10Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Further investigation indicated that the positive charge of the guanidinium group of Arg, and not the aliphatic portion, was the critical determinant for the S4 recognition of Arg at P4, suggesting that Kex2 binds aliphatic and basic residues using different binding modes (10Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Such dual specificity at P4 is not observed with furin, which has a clear preference for Arg at this position (14Krysan D.J. Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23229-23234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, increasing the net negative charge in the S4 subsite of Kex2 would be expected to disfavor the binding of aliphatic residues and enhance binding of basic ones. Indeed, T252D-Kex2 exhibited kcat/Km values with the model substrates Ac-βYKR↓MCA and Ac-RYKR↓MCA that indicated a 5-fold preference for Arg over Nle at P4 (see Table I). Unexpectedly, the Kex2 mutant with a putative S6 mutation, Q283E-Kex2, also exhibited an increased, 4-fold, preference for Arg over Nle, whereas the double mutant T252D/Q283E-Kex2 displayed similar specificity constants to wild type with these substrates. Thus, the very slightly enhanced recognition of Arg over Nle at P4 in tetrapeptides with Arg P1 was observed with both of the putative S4 and S6 mutant enzymes but not the double mutant.Table Ikcat/Km values for substrate cleavage by wild type and mutant Kex2Substratekcat/Km values for indicated enzymesWild typeT252DQ283ET252D/Q283Em-1 s-1m-1 s-1m-1 s-1m-1 s-1AcAAAYKR ↓ MCA1.6 × 1078.3 × 1061.6 × 1073.7 × 106AcAARYKR ↓ MCA5.4 × 107aThese data were previously published (14).5.3 × 1072.1 × 1081.2 × 108AcRAAYKR ↓ MCA7.0 × 1071.2 × 1083.9 × 1075.5 × 107AcRAKYKR ↓ MCA1.4 × 1081.2 × 1088.0 × 1072.0 × 108AcRARYKR ↓ MCA9.6 × 107aThese data were previously published (14).1.4 × 1083.9 × 1081.9 × 108AcRAπYKR ↓ MCA1.5 × 1075.6 × 1062.5 × 1073.2 × 107AcAYKR ↓ MCA4.3 × 106bThese data were previously published (10).8.0 × 1061.0 × 1073.6 × 106AcRYKR ↓ MCA1.2 × 108aThese data were previously published (14).6.5 × 1071.5 × 1081.1 × 108AcβYKR ↓ MCA4.3 × 107bThese data were previously published (10).1.3 × 1073.8 × 1074.3 × 107AcAYKK ↓ MCA1.2 × 103bThese data were previously published (10).1.2 × 104≤5.0 × 1031.1 × 103AcRYKK ↓ MCA1.2 × 105bThese data were previously published (10).8.3 × 1051.5 × 1052.9 × 105AcβYKK ↓ MCA9.2 × 104bThese data were previously published (10).2.8 × 1053.8 × 1044.8 × 104a These data were previously published (14Krysan D.J.

Open table in a new tab Previously, it was demonstrated that P4 recognition becomes more important when Lys is substituted for Arg at P1 (10Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Substitution of Lys for Arg at this position resulted in a change of the rate-limiting step from hydrolysis of the acyl enzyme intermediate (deacylation) to its formation (acylation) (10Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Rockwell N.C. Fuller R.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3657-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Comparison of kcat/Km values for AcβYKK↓MCA and AcRYKK↓MCA showed an increasing preference for P4 Arg versus Nle in the order WT < T252D-Kex2 < Q283E-Kex2 < T252D/Q283E-Kex2 (see Table I). T252D/Q283E-Kex2 exhibited a 6-fold preference for Arg over Nle at P4 in the context of Lys at P1. Although the effects of the T252D and Q283E substitutions were not additive, each mutation contributed toward the increased specificity of the double mutant for P4 Arg versus Nle. Relative to WT-Kex2, T252D-Kex2 exhibited a 7-fold higher kcat/Km for AcRYKK↓MCA and a 3-fold higher kcat/Km for AcβYKK↓MCA (see Table I). Q283E-Kex2 exhibited a 2.5-fold reduction kcat/Km for AcβYKK↓MCA relative to WT-Kex2 (see Table I). These results suggested that both an increased acylation rate with the P4 Arg substrate and a decreased acylation rate with the P4 Nle substrate contribute to the enhanced discrimination of Arg versus Nle by T252D/Q283E-Kex2. Backbone Contacts at P5 and P6 Affect P4 Recognition by WT but Not Mutant Forms of Kex2—Most kinetic analyses of Kex2 specificity have been performed with substrates lacking a P6 residue. To evaluate the contribution of the S6-P6 interaction toward the processing of hexapeptide substrates, the proteolysis of a series of hexapeptide substrates was analyzed using pseudo first order kinetics (Fig. 3). However, in addition to specific interactions, P5 and P6 residues in hexapeptide substrates could conceivably provide nonspecific backbone contacts that could reduce the relative importance of P4 binding. This possibility was tested for WT and mutant enzymes by comparing the kcat/Km ratio for a pair of hexapeptide substrates with Ala at P5 and P6 (AcAARYKR-MCA and AcAAAYKR↓MCA) to the kcat/Km ratio for the analogous tetrapeptide substrates (AcRYKR↓MCA and AcAYKR↓MCA; Fig. 4, Table I). In the case of WT Kex2, the specificity for Arg versus Ala at P4 decreased from 28-fold in the tetrapeptide context to 3.4-fold in the hexapeptide context. Moreover, the"

In the F1F0 ATP synthase enzyme complex, the peripheral stalk consists of a parallel dimer of identical b subunits. Dimerization of the b subunits is thought to be an early event necessary for enzyme assembly and function (14Sorgen P.L. Bubb M.R. McCormick K.A. Edison A.S. Cain B.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 923-932Google Scholar). The two b subunits exist in an extended α-helical conformation, spanning from the periplasmic side of the membrane to near the top of F1. However, because of the asymmetric nature of the enzyme complex, the two b subunits cannot participate in identical protein-protein interactions with the other subunits. In the N-terminal membrane-spanning region, the peripheral stalk contacts a single a subunit. Similarly, at the C-terminal end of the peripheral stalk, the two b subunits interact with a single δ subunit. The b dimer has been studied by a variety of traditional biochemical approaches such as CD spectroscopy, cross-linking, and sedimentation experiments (10Cain B.D. J. Bioenerg.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15598-15604Google Scholar) studied the N-terminal membrane-spanning domain by NMR using a 34-amino acid polypeptide, revealing an α-helix with a 20° bend at Pro-27 and -28. A systematic mutagenesis approach supported the model described in the NMR paper, suggesting that the extreme N termini of the two b subunits were in close contact, and then the subunits flared apart as they traversed the membrane (23Dmitriev O. Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15598-15604Google Scholar, 24Hardy A.W. Grabar T.B. Bhatt D. Cain B.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 389-397Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography of a model polypeptide reflecting residues 62–122 corresponding to the dimerization domain showed an extended highly α-helical structure (25Del Rizzo P.A. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. Shilton B.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6875-6884Google Scholar). The structures of the tether domain contributing to the segment between the membrane surface and the bottom of F1 and the F1 binding domain in the C-terminal region have yet to be determined. Previously (27Sorgen P.L. Caviston T.L. Perry R.C. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27873-27878Google Scholar, 28Sorgen P.L. Bubb M.R. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36261-36266Google Scholar) we have shown that b subunits with deletions and insertions in the tether region of up to 11 and 14 amino acids, respectively, formed functional F1F0 complexes. These observations suggested that flexibility is an inherent characteristic of the peripheral stalk. This apparent flexibility also extended to the dimerization of the b subunits. When two b subunits with tether domains of unequal length were expressed together, F1F0 ATP synthase complexes containing heterodimeric peripheral stalks were assembled (29Grabar T.B. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34751-34756Google Scholar). F1F0 complexes were able to tolerate the incorporation of two different b subunits with a size difference of at least 14 amino acids. Although activity data suggested the heterodimeric F1F0 complexes were likely functional, the earlier study was not designed to rigorously demonstrate that these complexes were active. A major problem that plagued all mutagenesis studies of the b subunit was that mutations constructed in the uncF(b) gene affected both subunits of the b homodimer. One missense mutation led to two amino acid replacements. Our ability to express two different b subunits in the same cell and detect b subunit heterodimer formation provided an approach to studying the individual functional roles of the b subunits. In the present study, two different b subunit mutations were studied. Mutation of an evolutionarily conserved arginine, bArg-36, to an isoleucine or glutamate has been shown previously to result in an intact completely defective F1F0 ATP synthase complex (30Caviston T.L. Ketchum C.J. Sorgen P.L. Nakamoto R.K. Cain B.D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 201-206Google Scholar). Also, deletion of the last four amino acids at the C terminus has been shown to affect the ability of the b dimer to form a stable interaction with the δ subunit F1, resulting in a major defect in F1F0 ATP synthase assembly (31Takeyama M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16106-16112Google Scholar, 32McLachlin D.T. Bestard J.A. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15162-15168Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate functional activity for F1F0 ATP synthase complexes containing a heterodimeric peripheral stalk, with major defects occurring in the different domains of each b subunit. Materials—Molecular biology enzymes and oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen, New England Biolabs, and Stratagene. Reagents were obtained from Sigma, Bio-Rad, and Fisher. Western blotting reagents and high performance chemiluminescence film were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Polyclonal antibodies against SDS-denatured b subunit (33Deckers-Hebestreit G.

Monoclonal antibodies against the V5 epitope were purchased from Invitrogen. Strains and Media—The wild type b subunit expression plasmid, pKAM14, and plasmids used to express Arg-36 mutation b subunits have been described previously (17McCormick K.A. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24683-24691Google Scholar, 30Caviston T.L. Ketchum C.J. Sorgen P.L. Nakamoto R.K. Cain B.D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 201-206Google Scholar). The plasmids encoding the uncF(b) gene were used to complement E. coli strain KM2 (Δb) carrying a chromosomal deletion of the gene (35McCormick K.A. Cain B.D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7240-7248Google Scholar). All strains were streaked onto plates containing minimal A medium supplemented with succinate (0.2% w/v) to determine enzyme viability. Cells harvested for membrane preparation were grown in Luria broth supplemented with glucose (0.2% w/v). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (40 μg/ml), ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) were added to the medium as needed. All cultures were incubated at 37 °C for the appropriate duration. Recombinant DNA Techniques—Plasmid DNA was purified with the Qiagen Mini-Prep and Maxi-Prep kits. Restriction endonuclease digestions, ligations, and transformations were performed according to the recommendations of the manufacturers (New England Biolabs, Stratagene, and Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed either by means of a Stratagene QuikChange kit or by ligation-mediated mutagenesis. DNA fragments were separated in 0.8% agarose gel by electrophoresis and purified using a Qiagen, Inc. QIAquick gel extraction kit. Plasmid sequences were determined by automated sequencing in the core facility of the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research. Mutagenesis and Strain Construction—Plasmid pKAM14 (b, Apr) (17McCormick K.A. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24683-24691Google Scholar) was used to construct b subunits with a deletion of the last four amino acids. Plasmids pKAM14 (b, Apr) (17McCormick K.A. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24683-24691Google Scholar), pTLC11 (bArg-36→ Ile, Apr), or pTLC15 (bArg-36→ Glu, Apr) (30Caviston T.L. Ketchum C.J. Sorgen P.L. Nakamoto R.K. Cain B.D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 201-206Google Scholar) were used to construct the epitope-tagged b subunits. Epitope tags were inserted into each of the plasmids using the Stratagene QuikChange kit. A histidine epitope tag was inserted at the N terminus by mutagenesis between the first and second codons of the uncF(b) gene to express bHis or bΔ153→end-His. All of the recombinant histidine-tagged b subunit plasmids were then digested with PstI and NdeI and subsequently ligated into a plasmid conferring the chloramphenicol resistance gene and the pACYC184 origin of replication (see Table I). A V5 epitope tag was added to the C terminus by site-directed mutagenesis before the termination codon of the uncF(b) gene to express bV5, bArg-36→ Ile-V5, or bArg-36→ Glu-V5 (see Fig. 1A). The recombinant V5-tagged b subunit plasmids included the ampicillin resistance gene and the pUC18 origin of replication. Unique restriction enzyme sites SphI and NdeI were constructed near the histidine and V5 epitope tag sequence, respectively, for an initial detection of the insertions, and then the nucleotide sequence was subsequently confirmed by automated sequencing in the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research core facility. Throughout this paper, the mutation and the epitope tag are indicated along with the plasmid name for clarity; for example, plasmid pTAM51 (bΔ153→end-His). Each plasmid and the control plasmids pKAM14 (b) and pBR322 were expressed in the E. coli cell line KM2 (Δb) for study, so that the only b subunits in the cells were the product of the plasmid genes. The two-plasmid expression system allowed expression of various combinations of histidine- and V5-tagged b subunits in the same cell (see Figs. 1C, 3C, and 5C). Appropriate antibiotics were added to the growth medium, and in the case of the coexpressed plasmids, both ampicillin and chloramphenicol were added to select for cells expressing both plasmids.Table IAerobic growth properties of mutants expressing epitope-tagged uncF(b) genes and membrane-associated ATP hydrolysis activityStrainsDescriptionGrowthaE. coli strains were grown aerobically on succinate minimal medium.

Caviston T.L. Perry R.C. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27873-27878Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (36Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Google Scholar). Nickel-resin purification was achieved using the High Capacity Nickel Chelate Affinity Matrix purchased from Sigma. A total of 5 mg of membrane protein was brought up to 1 ml with final concentrations of 0.2% tegamineoxide WS-35, 0.15 m NaCl, and 1 mm imidazole. The purification procedure was accomplished using the batch method as described by the manufacturer. Assay of F1F0-ATP Synthase Activity—Growth on a minimal succinate medium was used as an initial in vivo assay for enzyme viability. ATP hydrolysis activity was assayed by the acid molybdate method (37Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3292-3300Google Scholar). The membranes were assayed in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 9.1) to determine the linearity with respect to time and enzyme concentration. Membrane energization was detected by the fluorescence quenching of 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (ACMA) 1The abbreviations used are: ACMA, 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. (38Aris J.P. Klionsky D.J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11207-11215Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were loaded on a 15% Tris-glycine SDS gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose by electroblot. The b subunit antibody incubation was performed essentially as described by Grabar and Cain (29Grabar T.B. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34751-34756Google Scholar; see also Ref. 39Tamarappoo B.K. Handlogten M.E. Laine R.O. Serrano M.A. Dugan J. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2370-2374Google Scholar) using a 1:25,000 dilution of the anti-b subunit antibodies. Secondary antibody incubation was performed with horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:50,000), and the antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. The V5 subunit antibody incubation was performed as described by the manufacturer followed by a secondary antibody incubation with horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse antibody (1:10,000). Signals were visualized on high performance chemiluminescence film using a Kodak X-Omat. Construction and Growth Characteristics of Mutants—To investigate the function of individual b subunits in a F1F0 ATP synthase enzyme complex, plasmids expressing defective b subunits with either a histidine or a V5 epitope tag were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. A total of five plasmids were constructed expressing the bwt-His, bΔ153→end-His, bwt-V5, bArg-36→ Ile-V5, or bArg-36→ Glu-V5 subunits (Table I). The epitope tags were needed to facilitate enzyme purification and subunit detection on a Western blot, respectively. To express two different b subunits in the same cell, we used the two-plasmid expression system described previously (29Grabar T.B. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34751-34756Google Scholar). Enzyme complexes incorporated with a histidine or V5 epitope-tagged b subunit homodimer have been studied previously (29Grabar T.B. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34751-34756Google Scholar) and were shown to result in a functional enzyme complex. E. coli strain KM2 (Δb) was used as the host because the uncF(b) gene has been deleted, eliminating any background b subunit. Previous analyses (30Caviston T.L. Ketchum C.J. Sorgen P.L. Nakamoto R.K. Cain B.D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 201-206Google Scholar, 31Takeyama M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16106-16112Google Scholar, 32McLachlin D.T. Bestard J.A. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15162-15168Google Scholar) of F1F0 ATP synthase complexes incorporated with the mutant bArg-36→ Ile, bArg-36→ Glu or bΔ153→end subunits found the mutants to be completely defective. Therefore, our ability to form F1F0 complexes containing b heterodimers offered an approach to study activity in a complex with only a single functional b subunit protein. First, the effects of the bArg-36→ Ile-V5, bArg-36→ Glu-V5, and bΔ153→end-His mutations were studied for dimerization with a wild type epitope-tagged b subunit to complement the E. coli strain KM2 (Δb) (35McCormick K.A. Cain B.D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7240-7248Google Scholar). Growth on succinate minimal medium was used as an initial qualitative gauge of enzyme activity in vivo because E. coli strains lacking F1F0 ATP synthase cannot derive energy from nonfermentable carbon sources (Table I). As expected, when any one of the mutants was expressed alone in the cells, no growth was detected. In each case, the strains coexpressing the mutant epitope-tagged b subunits with a wild type epitope-tagged b subunit grew comparably to the wild type strain. Heterodimer Formation of bArg-36-defective Subunits with bwt—Although two b subunits of unequal length formed a heterodimer in an intact F1F0 ATP synthase complex (29Grabar T.B. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34751-34756Google Scholar), it was possible that a single amino acid substitution could affect dimerization, preventing assembly of a complex. To consider whether a V5 epitope-tagged bArg-36 subunit, bArg-36→ Ile-V5 or bArg-36→ Glu-V5, could form a heterodimer with a wild type histidine epitope-tagged b subunit, bwt-His, each pair of subunits was expressed in strains KM2/pTAM37/pTAM53 and KM2/pTAM37/pTAM54 (Δb) (Fig. 1, A and B). The b subunits were detected in membranes prepared from strains expressing a b subunit by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–9). However, only b subunits in complexes with at least one histidine tag were retained by nickel-resin purification (Fig. 1A, lanes 10–13). Immunoblot analysis using an anti-V5 antibody was performed on the membrane preparations and nickel-purified products (Fig. 1B). The V5 epitope tag was detected only in membrane vesicles derived from KM2 strains expressing either the V5-tagged b subunit or the coexpressed V5- and histidine-tagged b subunits (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–9). When only V5-tagged b subunits were expressed alone in a cell, no F1F0 complexes were recovered from the nickel-resin purification (Fig. 1B, lane 10). Finally, we investigated the ability of bwt-His to dimerize to form intact F1F0 ATP synthase complexes with bArg-36→ Ile-V5 or bArg-36→ Glu-V5. Both bArg-36→ Ile-V5 and bArg-36→ Glu-V5 were detected with anti-V5 antibodies after nickel-resin purification (Fig. 1B, lanes 12–13). The only mechanism for the recovery of defective V5-tagged b subunits was through dimerization with bwt-His indicating formation of heterodimeric F1F0 ATP synthase complexes. Therefore, coexpression of the two different b subunits in the same cell led to three distinct interactions within an intact F1F0 ATP synthase complex (Fig. 1C): 1) a homodimer of bwt-His, 2) a homodimer of bArg-36→ Ile-V5 or bArg-36→ Glu-V5, and 3) a heterodimer consisting of both the defective and wild type b subunit. Because F1 reduced affinity for the membrane in the absence of intact F0, total membrane-associated F1-ATP hydrolysis activity was used as a test of F1F0 ATP synthase complex assembly. Under conditions of high pH, F1 can be released from the influence of F0 (37Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3292-3300Google Scholar); therefore, the amount of ATPase activity in the solution was used as a measure of the amount of intact enzyme complex located in the membrane vesicles. Previous data (29Grabar T.B. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34751-34756Google Scholar) indicated minimal effects on specific activity because of the epitope tags. Confirming these observations, the V5 epitope tag did not have an apparent effect on enzyme assembly. Membrane preparations with a bwt-V5 incorporated into the F1F0 ATP synthase complex had virtually the same specific activity of the wild type strain (Table I). A small decrease in specific activity was reproducibly observed in membrane vesicles isolated from cells when a histidine epitope tag was incorporated onto the bwt (∼89% of the wild type strain). Furthermore, comparable activities were observed in samples when the histidine- and V5-tagged bwt subunits were coexpressed. Also verifying previous data (30Caviston T.L. Ketchum C.J. Sorgen P.L. Nakamoto R.K. Cain B.D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 201-206Google Scholar), when bArg-36→ Ile-V5 or bArg-36→ Glu-V5 was expressed alone in strains KM2/pTAM53 and KM2/pTAM54, the membranes retained abundant activity (∼60 and 54% of the wild type strain, respectively) (Table I), indicating considerable amounts of intact F1F0 ATP synthase complexes found in the membranes. When bArg-36→ Ile-V5 or bArg-36→ Glu-V5 was coexpressed with bwt-His by construction of strains KM2/pTAM37/pTAM53 or KM2/pTAM37/pTAM54, specific activities of about 94 and 91%, respectively, were observed, indicating a quantity of intact F1F0 ATP synthase complexes approaching the wild type strain levels. F1F0 ATP synthase-mediated ATP-driven proton pumping activity in membrane vesicles prepared from the epitope-tagged mutants was used as an indication of coupled activity. Acidification of inverted membrane vesicles was examined by fluorescence of ACMA (Fig. 2). Membranes isolated from cells with a V5 epitope tag incorporated onto the bwt subunit, KM2/pTAM46 (bwt-V5), reproducibly displayed a very small reduction in coupled activity, correlating very well with the F1-ATP hydrolysis activity. Consistent with previous observations, a larger reduction in coupled activity of about 20% was observed in membrane vesicles isolated from strain KM2/pTAM37 (bwt-His) (29Grabar T.B. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34751-34756Google Scholar). The coupled activities observed in membranes isolated from cells coexpressing histidine- and V5-tagged b subunits were intermediary between the V5-tagged species and the histidine-tagged species. Strains expressing either bArg-36→ Ile-V5 or bArg-36→ Glu-V5 displayed no ATP-dependent proton pumping activity as expected. Significantly, when either one of the barg-36 mutants was coexpressed with bwt-His, KM2/pTAM37/pTAM53 (bwt-His/bArg-36→ Ile-V5) or KM2/pTAM37/pTAM54 (bwt-His/bArg-36→ Glu-V5), the coupled activity observed was essentially the same as strain KM2/pTAM37/pTAM46 (bwt-His/bwt-V5). When expressed alone, the strains with bArg-36-V5 mutants had no activity, and the strains expressing bwt-His displayed less activity than the bwt-His/barg-36-V5 mutant enzyme. As a consequence, it was most likely that the F1F0 ATP synthase complexes with either the bwt-His/bArg-36→ Ile-V5 or bwt-His/bArg-36→ Glu-V5 peripheral stalks were active. To demonstrate that the membrane vesicles were intact and closed, the level of NADH-driven fluorescence quenching was monitored for all membrane preparations. The levels of NADH-driven fluorescence quenching were strong and directly comparable in every case (data not shown). Heterodimer Formation of bΔ153→end-His Complemented with bwt-V5—Deletion of the last four amino acids at the C terminus has been shown to dramatically affect the ability of the b dimer to form a stable interaction with the δ subunit F1 resulting in a major F1F0 ATP synthase assembly defect (31Takeyama M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16106-16112Google Scholar, 32McLachlin D.T. Bestard J.A. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15162-15168Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed to detect a heterodimer interaction between bΔ153→end and bwt (Fig. 3, A and B). Coexpression of pTAM51 (bΔ153→end-His) and pTAM46 (bwt-V5) in the same cell resulted in the appearance of a weak signal representing bwt-V5 in nickel-resin purified material (Fig. 3B, lane 8). Although there was no attempt to be quantitative in this assay, the appearance of the band suggested relatively inefficient assembly of these heterodimers. Nevertheless, when the two different b subunits were expressed in the same cell, three distinct F1F0 complexes were assembled. These included a homodimer of bwt-V5 in an intact F1F0 ATP synthase complex, a homodimer of bΔ153→end-His in a partially assembled defective enzyme, and a heterodimeric F1F0 ATP synthase consisting of both subunits. Apparently, the bwt-V5 subunit stabilized the bΔ153→end-His subunit within an intact F1F0 ATP synthase complex. Total membrane-associated F1-ATP hydrolysis activity was used as a test of F1F0 ATP synthase complex assembly (Table I). As expected, membranes with enzyme complexes incorporated with bΔ153→end-His displayed a specific activity similar to the negative control, indicating virtually no interaction with F1. Coexpression of pTAM51 (bΔ153→end-His) and pTAM46 (bwt-V5) resulted in a specific activity of about 81% of the wild type strain (Table I). An indication of coupled activity was shown by F1F0 ATP synthase-mediated ATP-driven proton pumping activity in membrane vesicles prepared from the epitope-tagged mutants (Fig. 4). Membranes containing only the bΔ153→end-His subunit exhibited no coupled activity as expected. Membranes isolated from cells coexpressing pTAM51 (bΔ153→end-His) and pTAM46 (bwt-V5) displayed a slight reduction in coupled activity of about 20% compared with membranes from cells coexpressing bwt-V5 and bwt-His. It is feasible that the observed reductions in enzymatic activities were entirely because of formation of the mutant homodimeric species. This could not be directly demonstrated by these methods due to background activity from bwt-V5 homodimeric F1F0 ATP synthases present in the membranes. Mutual Complementation—To look for mutual complementation of b subunits with defects in different functional domains, bArg-36→ Ile-V5 and bArg-36→ Glu-V5 were coexpressed with bΔ153→end-His in the absence of a functional wild type b subunit. Significantly, when bΔ153→end-His and bArg-36→ Ile-V5 were coexpressed in the same cell (KM2/pTAM51/pTAM53), small colonies were present after 5 days of growth. Expression of either bArg-36→ Ile-V5 or bΔ153→end-His alone in KM2 (Δb) resulted in a completely defective enzyme complex; any F1F0 ATP synthase activity must necessarily have come from a heterodimer formed from two defective b subunits. Therefore, the bArg-36→ Ile and bΔ153→end mutations qualified as intergenic second site suppressor mutations. To determine whether there was a direct protein-protein interaction between two mutant subunits, we investigated the ability of bΔ153→end-His to form an interaction with bArg-36→ Ile-V5 or bArg-36→ Glu-V5 by the standard immunoblot (Fig. 5, A and B). All of the controls provided on the first immunoblot were included and displayed similar results. An additional control was included to ensure complete solubilization of membrane vesicles was achieved and nonspecific aggregation of the b subunits was not a concern (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 10 and 11). Two independent membrane preparations were mixed together. Membrane vesicles derived from strains KM2/pTAM51 (bΔ153→end-His) and KM2/pTAM53 (bArg-36→ Ile-V5) or KM2/pTAM54 (bArg-36→ Glu-V5) were mixed, and the membranes were solubilized with 0.2% tegamineoxide WS-35 prior to nickel-resin purification. Immunoblot analysis with anti-b antibodies showed normal levels of histidine-tagged b subunit upon nickel-resin purification (Fig. 5A, lanes 10 and 11). No V5 epitope was present after nickel-resin purification, indicating that neither nonspecific aggregation nor incomplete solubilization was a factor in the observed results (Fig. 5B, lanes 10 and 11). Therefore, in cells expressing two different b subunits, any observed interactions of b subunits must have been because of heterodimers integrating into an intact F1F0 ATP synthase complex. Importantly, immunobotting using the anti-V5 antibody clearly detected V5 epitope-tagged b subunits in nickel-resin purified samples when two different b subunits, bΔ153→end-His and bArg-36→ Ile-V5 or bArg-36→ Glu-V5, were coexpressed (Fig. 5B, lanes 12 and 13). The data indicated that dimerization between the two defective b subunits could occur, and the F1F0 ATP synthase complex accepted incorporation of a b heterodimer with mutations affecting two different domains. Expression of two different defective b subunits yielded three distinct F1F0 ATP synthase complexes including the bArg-36→ Ile-V5 or bArg-36→ Glu-V5 homodimeric F1F0 (a partially assembled bΔ153→end-His homodimer complex) and the heterodimeric F1F0 ATP synthase complexes. Total membrane-associated F1-ATP hydrolysis activity was used as a test of F1F0 ATP synthase complex assembly (Table I). Membrane vesicles isolated from strains KM2/pTAM51/pTAM53 (bΔ153→end-His/bArg-36→ Ile-V5) and KM2/pTAM51/pTAM54 (bΔ153→end-His/bArg-36→ Glu-V5) yielded membrane-associated specific activities of about 29 and 14%, respectively, which was intermediate between the specific activities if either of the mutants were expressed alone in the cell. An indication of coupled activity was obtained by F1F0 ATP synthase-mediated ATP-driven proton pumping activity in membrane vesicles prepared from the epitope-tagged mutants (Fig. 6). As expected, membranes from all three strains expressing defective b subunits by themselves showed no proton pumping activity. Membranes isolated from cells expressing bΔ153→end-His/bArg-36→ Ile-V5 or bΔ153→end-His/bArg-36→ Glu-V5 (KM2/pTAM51/pTAM53 or KM2/pTAM51/pTAM54, respectively) displayed coupled ATP-driven proton pumping of about 20 and 16%. Because either homodimer leads to a completely defective enzyme, any coupled activity observed necessarily came from an intact heterodimeric F1F0 ATP synthase. The data indicated that F1F0 ATP synthase complexes incorporated with heterodimers of two mutant b subunits were indeed functional. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the roles of the two b subunits in the peripheral stalk were not equivalent. Historically the b subunit dimer has been viewed as a single functional unit. However, the asymmetric nature of the F1F0 ATP synthase enzyme complex suggested that the functional role of each b subunit should not necessarily be considered equivalent. Protein-protein contacts made by one b subunit cannot be made by the other. In the present work, a unique expression system that facilitates the production, purification, and detection of F1F0 ATP synthase complexes incorporated with a b subunit heterodimer was utilized to study the functional roles of the two b subunits. The experiments involved a two-plasmid expression system that directed the production of two different b subunits in the same cell and an epitope tag system that allowed detection of a b subunit heterodimeric F1F0 ATP synthase species. Two regions of the b subunit were considered. An evolutionarily conserved arginine, bArg-36, located near the interface between the membrane and tether domains had been found to be crucial for F1F0 ATP synthase function (30Caviston T.L. Ketchum C.J. Sorgen P.L. Nakamoto R.K. Cain B.D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 201-206Google Scholar). Enzyme complexes incorporated with a bArg-36→ Ile-V5 or bArg-36→ Glu-V5 were found to be intact yet functionally defective. Also, the C-terminal last four amino acids had been shown to be essential for the F1 binding domain (31Takeyama M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16106-16112Google Scholar, 32McLachlin D.T. Bestard J.A. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15162-15168Google Scholar). Enzyme complexes with a bΔ153→end-His were found to be only partially assembled. However, the bArg-36 missense mutations in combination with the C-terminal deletion proved to be mutually suppressing mutations. Dimerization was observed in membrane preparations from cells expressing both bΔ153→end-His/bArg-36→ Ile-V5 and bΔ153→end-His/bArg-36→ Glu-V5. More importantly, enzyme complexes incorporated with the mutant heterodimers were functionally active, suggesting that each of the b subunits was complementing the other to form an intact and functional enzyme complex. This observation demonstrated unambiguously that F1F0 ATP synthase complexes containing b heterodimers were active and provided evidence that each of the individual b subunits provides specialized functions within the peripheral stalk. Clearly, each of the mutant b subunits compensates for what the other is lacking. This raises a question concerning the relative positions of the individual b subunits of the peripheral stalk. For F1F0 ATP synthase containing the two different mutant b subunits to be intact and functional, it is likely that the bArg-36→ Ile-V5 (or bArg-36→ Glu-V5) subunit must be positioned such that its extreme C terminus forms the appropriate contacts with the δ subunit of F1. Similarly, the bΔ153→end-His subunit must be positioned so that its bArg-36 makes the appropriate contacts with the F0 subunits (Fig. 7). Incorrect positioning of the mutant b subunits during assembly might be expected to lead to an inactive or partially assembled enzyme complex."

In death receptor-mediated apoptosis, the activation of Bak depends on activation of caspase-8. However, we found that exposure of the N terminus of Bak (but not oligomerization) can occur in the absence of active caspase-8. Although exposure of the N terminus of Bak without oligomerization is not sufficient to release cytochrome c from the mitochondria and commit cells to apoptosis, this change sensitizes the mitochondria to apoptotic signals (including Bid) and thus sensitizes cells to apoptotic death. Fas-induced, caspase-8-independent exposure of the N terminus of Bak is blocked by staurosporine, a pan protein kinase inhibitor. These results suggest that Fas stimulation not only activates caspase-8, but also a distinct signaling pathway involving protein kinase(s) to induce exposure of the N terminus of Bak.

Mitochondria play a crucial role in many physiological and pathological cell death paradigms in mammals. Most apoptotic stimuli convey death signals to the mitochondria. During apoptosis, the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane increases, resulting in the release of proteins into the cytoplasm from the intermembrane space, including several apoptogenic molecules such as cytochrome c, Smac (Diablo), HtrA2 (Omi), and apoptosis-inducing factor. After being released into the cytoplasm, cytochrome c binds to apoptotic protease activating factor 1, which recruits and activates procaspase-9, triggering the activation of the caspase cascade and committing the cell to apoptotic death. Smac (Diablo) and HtrA2 (Omi) facilitate caspase activation by inhibiting inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, which are endogenous caspase inhibitors (1Wolf B.B. Green D.R. Curr.

Mitochondrial membrane permeability is regulated by a group of proteins called the Bcl-2 family. This family of proteins can be divided into anti-apoptotic members (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) and pro-apoptotic members, which consist of multidomain members (Bak and Bax) and BH3-only proteins (Bid, Bim, Bik, Bad, Noxa, and Puma) (3Tsujimoto Y.

Multidomain pro-apoptotic Bak and Bax are functionally redundant and play a direct role in increasing mitochondrial membrane permeability, leading to the release of apoptogenic proteins (5Wei M.C.

After apoptotic stimulation, these proteins are primarily activated by different mechanism(s) and then activate Bak/Bax by still unknown mechanism(s) or inactivate anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, finally leading to an increase of mitochondrial membrane permeability (3Tsujimoto Y.

In type I cells, there is extensive caspase-8 activation, which is sufficient to activate downstream execution caspases such as caspase-3 or caspase-7 and commit the cell to apoptotic death. In type II cells, there is less caspase-8 activation, so mitochondrial amplification of the apoptotic signal is required (7Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J.

Because Bax and Bak are constitutively expressed, and the amount of these proteins usually remains unchanged during apoptosis, it is believed that Bak or Bax activation is regulated at the post-translational level (3Tsujimoto Y.

Bax is localized in the cytoplasm of living cells: after apoptotic stimulation, Bax translocates to the outer mitochondrial membrane where it oligomerizes and induces the formation of protein-conducting pores that release apoptogenic proteins (3Tsujimoto Y.

Bak is present on the outer mitochondrial membrane in a latent form: after accepting an upstream apoptotic signal, it undergoes oligomerization and induces the release of apoptogenic molecules from the mitochondria (11Wei M.C.

Concealed epitopes at the N terminus of Bax or Bak are revealed after apoptotic stimulation, suggesting that a conformational change occurs in Bax and Bak or that a binding protein (which masks the N terminus) undergoes dissociation (10Desagher S.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7668-7676Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because it has been reported that exposure of the N terminus of Bax precedes its translocation to the mitochondria and oligomerization (12Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 20Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), it seems that exposure of the N terminus of Bax or Bak represents an intermediate step leading to their activation. Oligomerization of Bax/Bak is thought to reflect its activation, because Bax/Bak oligomerizes after apoptotic stimulation, and this process is correlated precisely with the release of cytochrome c, and oligomerized Bax, but not monomeric Bax, induces cytochrome c releasing from the isolated mitochondria (11Wei M.C.

However, the process of regulation of the activation of Bak during apoptosis, and the relationship between exposure of the N terminus of Bak and oligomerization in the activation process, are still unclear. In the present study, we found that Fas stimulation elicited a caspase-8-independent signal that induced exposure of the N terminus of Bak. This N-terminal exposure was not sufficient for full activation of Bak, but primed it to become more sensitive to apoptotic signals causing full activation. Antibodies and Reagents—Anti-Bak (Ab1) monoclonal antibody was purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Boston, MA). Anti-Bax (N20) and anti-Bid polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and R&D System (Minneapolis, MN), respectively. Anti-cytochrome c (6H2 and 7H8) and anti-mouse-Fas (Jo2) monoclonal antibodies were from BD Pharmingen. Anti-human Fas (CH11), anti-caspase-3, and anti-caspase-8 monoclonal antibodies were obtained from MBL (Nagoya, Japan). Anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and anti-porin (voltage-dependent anion channel protein) monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA) and Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), respectively. All of the secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The cross-linkers disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) and bismaleimidohexane (BMH) were from Pierce Biotechnology (Rockford, IL). Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Recombinant human Bid (rBid) was prepared as described previously (22Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—The human HeLa cell line, human Jurkat T-leukemic cell line and Jurkat caspase-8-deficient subline (JB6) (23Kawahara A. Ohsawa Y. Matsumura H. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1353-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from caspase-8-deficient mice were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. After incubation with 2% FBS in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h, the cells were incubated with anti-Bak (Ab1) (1:500) or anti-cytochrome c (1:500) for 1 h. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were incubated with the secondary antibody (Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG) for 1 h. Then fluorescence was detected under a confocal microscope (Zeiss, LSM510). Jurkat cells were fixed, permeabilized, and blocked with 20% FBS in PBS and then incubated with anti-Bak (Ab1) antibody followed by a secondary antibody (Alexa 568-conjugated anti-mouse IgG). The cells were subsequently analyzed by a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, FACSCalibur) or observed under a confocal fluorescence microscope. In all immunostaining experiments, normal mouse IgG was added instead of the primary antibody (IgG) as a negative control. Analysis of Cell Death—Cell viability was detected by staining with Annexin-V or Hoechst 33342. Briefly, cells were stained with Cy3-conjugated Annexin-V or 1 μm Hoechst 33342 for 5 min at room temperature and then analyzed using a flow cytometer or examined under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, BX50). Gel Filtration Analysis—Jurkat cells were treated, harvested, and extracted with HNC buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2% CHAPS). The extracts were applied to a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences), and fractions (40 μl) were collected for analysis by Western blotting. In some experiments, extracts were incubated with anti-Bak (Ab1) antibody or normal mouse IgG for 3 h before being applied to the column. Cross-linking—Jurkat cells were harvested, incubated with 1 mm or 0.1 mm BMH for 30 min at room temperature, and then incubated with 1 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min to quench the cross-linker. Next, the cells were solubilized in sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. When the cross-linker DSS was used, Jurkat cells were lysed with HNC buffer, and then the lysates were incubated with 1 mm DSS for 30 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) for 15 min to quench the cross-linker. As a control, the same concentration of Me2SO was added instead of reagents. siRNA Study—All siRNAs were produced by Dharmacon Research, and their sequences were as follows (numbers in parentheses indicate nucleotide positions within the respective open reading frame): mouse Bak (65–85), 5′-AACAGCAGGUUGCCCAGGACA-3′; mouse Bax (231–252), 5′-AGGAUGAUUGCUGACGUGGAC-3′; and GFP (274–294), 5′-GGCUACGUCCAGGAGCGCACC-3′. Cells were transfected with siRNA by electroporation using an Amaxa System three times at 48-h intervals. Permeabilized Cells—HeLa cells were cultured in 10-well glass slides. After washing twice with isotonic buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose), the cells were incubated with isotonic buffer containing 20 μg/ml digitonin for 3 min at room temperature. After washing three times with isotonic buffer, the cells were incubated with cytosol or rBid for 10 min at 37 °C. After washing another three times with isotonic buffer, the cells were subjected to immunostaining. Preparation of Cytosol—After washing three times with isotonic buffer, cells were suspended in the same volume of isotonic buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors, and then homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, the supernatant was obtained and used as the cytosol. Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were fractionated as described previously (24Nomura M. Shimizu S. Ito T. Narita M. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5542-5548PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, washed three times with isotonic buffer, and then incubated with 30 μg/ml digitonin in isotonic buffer for 5 min at 37 °C. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 3 min, aliquots of the supernatant (cytosolic fractions) and the pellet (containing the mitochondria) were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-cytochrome c antibody. In Vitro Analysis of Cytochrome c Release—Mitochondria were prepared from the livers of male Donryu rats as described previously (25Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Funahashi Y. Mignon A. Lacronique V. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1455-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Briefly, the livers were harvested and homogenized in buffer A (0.3 m mannitol, 10 mm potassium Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm EDTA) with a glass-Teflon Potter homogenizer. Then isolated mitochondria (100 μg of protein) were suspended in buffer B (buffer A plus 100 μm potassium phosphate and 4.3 mm succinate instead of EDTA) and incubated with 5 μl (40 μg of protein) of cytosol or with isotonic buffer for 5 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with or without rBid (30 μg) for a further 20 min. The mitochondria were collected by centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 5 min), and the supernatant was analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-cytochrome c antibody. Caspase-independent Exposure of the N Terminus of Bak Occurs in Fas-stimulated Cells—Using a monoclonal antibody (anti-Bak Ab1) that recognized the N-terminal epitope of human Bak, we examined whether there were any changes to the N terminus of Bak in HeLa cells treated with an agonistic anti-Fas antibody, CH11. As reported previously (13Griffiths G.J. Dubrez L. Morgan C.P. Jones N.A. Whitehouse J. Corfe B.M. Dive C. Hickman J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 19Griffiths G.J. Corfe B.M. Savory P. Leech S. Esposti M.D. Hickman J.A. Dive C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7668-7676Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), Bak could not be recognized in living cells by Ab1 antibody, whereas cells exhibited increased immunoreactivity to Ab1 antibody after Fas stimulation (Fig. 1, A and B). Because we could not detect any change of Bak protein content after treatment with CH11 (Fig. 1C), this increased immunoreactivity to Ab1 antibody indicated exposure of the N terminus of Bak. Exposure of the N terminus could be detected after 1 h of treatment with CH11, when only a few cells had died (Fig. 1, B and D), consistent with the findings of others that exposure of the N terminus was an early event occurring before morphological changes (13Griffiths G.J. Dubrez L. Morgan C.P. Jones N.A. Whitehouse J. Corfe B.M. Dive C. Hickman J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 19Griffiths G.J. Corfe B.M. Savory P. Leech S. Esposti M.D. Hickman J.A. Dive C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7668-7676Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In HeLa cells (type II cells), Fas stimulation initiates the activation of caspase-8, which cleaves Bid, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, and truncated Bid translocates to the mitochondria and activates Bak or Bax by a still unidentified mechanism (9Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3781) Google Scholar, 10Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether caspase-8 is involved in exposure of the N terminus of Bak, we employed a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) to suppress caspase activation. Unexpectedly, we found that z-VAD-fmk (100 μm) did not affect the increased immunoreactivity to Ab1 antibody in CH11-treated cells (Fig. 1, A and B), although the dose of z-VAD-fmk that we used could almost completely suppress the activation of caspases-8, cleavage of Bid, release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, activation of caspase-3, and cell death (Fig. 1, D–F). Because Bcl-2/Bcl-xL is known to inhibit the activation of Bax and Bak (26Mikhailov V. Mikhailova M. Pulkrabek D.J. Dong Z. Venkatachalam M.A. Saikumar P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18361-18374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 27Ruffolo S.C. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25039-25045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we also examined whether CH11-induced exposure of the N terminus of Bak was inhibited by Bcl-2. As shown in Fig. 1A, overexpression of Bcl-2 completely inhibited exposure of the N terminus of Bak in CH11-treated cells with or without exposure to z-VAD-fmk. We next tested whether the same phenomenon also occurred in other cell lines. As was the case for HeLa cells exposed to CH11, CH11-stimulated Jurkat cells displayed an increase of immunoreactivity to Ab1 antibody, which was not affected by z-VAD-fmk as assessed by FACS and confocal microscopy (Fig. 2, A–C). The dose of z-VAD-fmk used (100 μm) completely inhibited the activation of caspases, cleavage of Bid, and cell death (Fig. 2D and data not shown). Furthermore, we also found that exposure of the N terminus of Bak occurred in Fas-stimulated JB6 cells, a caspase-8-deficient subline of Jurkat cells (Fig. 2E). These results suggest that Fas stimulation could activate a caspase-8-independent signaling pathway and induce exposure of the N terminus of Bak, but this change of Bak was not sufficient for full activation. Fas-induced Caspase-independent Exposure of the N Terminus of Bak Is Separable from Oligomerization—Previous studies indicated that Bak undergoes homo-oligomerization in apoptotic cells (11Wei M.C.

Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Because its oligomerization is correlated with the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (11Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is thought to represent activation. Oligomerization of Bak can be detected either by using a protein cross-linker or by gel filtration column chromatography (11Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11615-11623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). With these procedures, we showed that Bak was oligomerized in CH11-treated cells and this change was inhibited by z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 3, A–C), indicating that its oligomerization was dependent on the activation of caspases. These results suggested that caspase-independent exposure of the N terminus of Bak was separable from its oligomerization. We further confirmed caspase-8-independent exposure of the N terminus of Bak by gel filtration. Lysates of Jurkat cells treated with or without CH11 in the presence or absence of z-VAD-fmk were incubated with Ab1 antibody or normal mouse IgG before being subjected to gel filtration column chromatography. If Bak binds to Ab1 antibody, it would be eluted in the fractions that correspond to the larger molecular size proteins. As shown in Fig. 3D, when the sample from untreated cells was incubated with Ab1 antibody and then applied to the column, Bak was detected in the fractions corresponding to low molecular weight proteins, as was the case without incubation with Ab1 antibody (Fig. 3C) or after incubation with control normal mouse IgG (Fig. 3D, upper panel), indicating no exposure of the N terminus of Bak. When the sample from CH11-treated cells was incubated with Ab1 antibody, Bak shifted to the larger molecular weight fractions, which were larger than that when the sample was incubated with normal mouse IgG or without Ab1 antibody (Fig. 3, C and D), suggesting that the N terminus was exposed in apoptotic cell lysates. When lysates from cells treated with CH11 in the presence of z-VAD-fmk were incubated with Ab1 antibody, the Bak peak was found in fractions that corresponded to both high and low molecular weight proteins (Fig. 3D, lower panel), indicating that Bak was recognized by Ab1 antibody in cells treated with CH11 in the presence of z-VAD-fmk. This result is consistent with our immunostaining data. Taken together, these observations suggest that Fas stimulation induces exposure of the N terminus of Bak in a caspase-8-independent manner and that N-terminal exposure is separable from the oligomerization of Bak. Exposure of the N Terminus of Bak Makes Cells More Sensitive to Apoptotic Stimuli—The results described above showed that Fas-dependent/caspase-independent exposure of the N terminus of Bak did not lead to its full activation. Did such exposure of N terminus have any biological significance? We hypothesized that full activation of Bak requires at least two steps, i.e. exposure of the N terminus, followed by oligomerization, and that Bak with N-terminal exposure might be in a “primed state.” It should be noted that exposure of the N terminus can be mediated by both caspase-8-dependent and independent mechanisms. If this hypothesis is correct, cells in which the N terminus of Bak is exposed may be more sensitive to subsequent death stimuli. To test this possibility, Jurkat cells were pretreated with CH11 in the presence of z-VAD-fmk for 2 h to “prime” Bak, and then were exposed to 10 μm VP-16 (etoposide) in the presence of z-VAD-fmk. z-VAD-fmk did not inhibit transmission of VP-16-induced death signals to the mitochondria or release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (data not shown). VP-16 induced the release of only a small amount of cytochrome c from the mitochondria in the cells without CH11 pretreatment (Fig. 4A, lanes 4, 7, and 10). In contrast, a large amount of cytochrome c was released after cells were pretreated with CH11/z-VAD-fmk and then exposed to VP-16 (Fig. 4A, lanes 3, 6, and 9). This result indicates that, although CH11 alone could not induce cytochrome c release in the presence of z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 4A, lanes 2, 5, and 8), it sensitized cells to subsequent treatment with VP-16, suggesting that Bak with N-terminal exposure might represent “primed Bak.” We also examined whether Fas-induced caspase-independent exposure of the N terminus of Bak could sensitize cells to apoptotic death. Because z-VAD-fmk inhibits apoptosis, we could not use it in experiments that assayed cell death. Therefore, we employed caspase-8-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), which are completely resistant to death receptor-mediated apoptosis (29Varfolomeev E.E. Schuchmann M. Luria V.

First, we investigated whether stimulation of Fas with agonistic anti-mouse Fas antibody Jo2 induced exposure of the N terminus of Bak in caspase-8-deficient MEFs. Because no antibody was available to recognize a conformational change of mouse Bak, we employed an in vitro assay system using HeLa cells permeabilized by digitonin. Lysates derived from caspase-8-/- MEFs treated with or without Jo2 were"
https://openalex.org/W1996946738,"The ubiquitous and pleiotropic dual specificity protein kinase CK2 has been studied and characterized in many organisms, from yeast to mammals. Generally, the enzyme is composed of two catalytic (α and/or α′) and two regulatory (β) subunits, forming a differently assembled tetramer. Although prone to controversial interpretation, the function of CK2 has been associated with fundamental biological processes such as signal transduction, cell cycle progression, cell growth, apoptosis, and transcription. Less known is the role of CK2 during meiosis and the early phase of embryogenesis. In this work, we studied CK2 activity during oocyte activation, a process occurring at the end of oocyte maturation and triggered by fertilization. In ascidian Ciona intestinalis, an organism whose complete genome has been published recently, CK2 was constitutively active in unfertilized and fertilized oocytes. The enzymatic activity oscillated through meiosis showing three major peaks: soon after fertilization (metaphase I exit), before metaphase II, and at the exit from metaphase II. Biochemical analysis of CK2 subunit composition in activated oocytes indicated that CK2-α was catalytically active as a monomer, independently from its regulatory subunit β; however, CK2-β was only detectable in unfertilized oocytes where it was associated with a bona fide identified ascidian mitogen-activated protein kinase. After fertilization, CK2-β was undetectable, suggesting its rapid degradation. Protein sequence analysis of CK2-α and -β cDNA indicated a high identity compared with vertebrate homologs. In addition, the absence of putative phosphorylation sites for Cdc2 kinase on both α and β subunits suggested an important role for CK2 in regulating meiotic cell cycle in C. intestinalis oocytes.

(formerly known as casein kinase 2) is a ubiquitous, highly pleiotropic, and constitutively active dual specificity kinase that phosphorylates serine/threonine and tyrosine residues. CK2 is generally described as a stable tetramer composed of two catalytic (α and/or α′) and two regulatory subunits (β) differently associated to form a α2β2, α′2β2, or αα′β2 complex (1Hathaway G.M. Traugh J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 317-331Google Scholar, 2Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Google Scholar, 3Litchfield D.W. Biochem.

Enzyme Regul. 1994; 34: 225-246Google Scholar). CK2 catalyzes the phosphorylation of a great number of substrates presenting multiple acidic residues surrounding the phosphoacceptor amino acid (for a recent review, see Ref. 4Pinna L.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3873-3878Google Scholar; 7Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Google Scholar). CK2 has been associated with the regulation of several biological processes. High levels of CK2 activity have been described in different types of cancer (for review, see Ref. 8Tawfic S. Yu S. Wang H. Faust R. Davis A. Ahmed K. Histol. Histopathol. 2001; 16: 573-582Google Scholar), including leukemia in cattle (9ole-MoiYoi O.K. Brown W.C. Iams K.P. Nayar A. Tsukamoto T. Macklin M.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1621-1631Google Scholar) and lymphoma and mammary tumorigenesis in transgenic mice expressing CK2-α (10Landesman-Bollag E. Song D.H. Romieu-Mourez R. Sussman D.J.

Compelling evidence indicates a role for CK2 in cell growth and, more recently, in cell death. Yeast CK2-α subunit is essential for cell viability and is required for progression through the cell division cycle (for review, see Ref. 12Glover III, C.V. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 95-133Google Scholar). In addition, the role of CK2 in mitosis is supported by two bits of circumstantial evidence: 1) CK2-α and -β subunits are phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner (13Litchfield D.W. Lozeman F.J. Cicirelli M.F. Harrylock M. Ericsson L.H. Piening C.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20380-20389Google Scholar, 14Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Lozeman F.J. Eisenman R.N. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13943-13951Google Scholar); 2) CK2 phosphorylates important cell cycle regulatory proteins, such as Cdc2/Cdc28 (15Russo G.L. Vandenberg M.T. Yu I.J. Bae Y.S. Franza Jr., B.R. Marshak D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20317-20325Google Scholar, 16Russo G.L. van den Bos C. Sutton A. Coccetti P. Baroni M.D. Alberghina L. Marshak D.R. Biochem.

More recently, a novel function of CK2 in regulating apoptotic cell death has emerged (3Litchfield D.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 1-15Google Scholar, 4Pinna L.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3873-3878Google Scholar, 18Ahmed K. Gerber D.A. Cochet C. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 226-230Google Scholar, 19Li P.F. Li J. Muller E.C. Otto A. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 247-258Google Scholar). More controversial and poorly understood is the role of CK2 during meiosis. In Xenopus oocyte nuclei, CK2 is probably the major phosphorylating protein, and its activity can be enhanced by polyamines (spermine or spermidine) and inhibited by heparin (20Leiva L. Carrasco D. Taylor A. Veliz M. Gonzalez C. Allende C.C. Allende J.E. Biochem. Int. 1987; 14: 707-717Google Scholar, 21Osborne H.B. Mulner-Lorillon O. Marot J. Belle R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 520-526Google Scholar). Besides, in the ovary of Xenopus, the mRNA amount for both the CK2-α and -β subunits is higher than many other mRNAs and increased during oogenesis, in parallel with the increment of enzymatic activity (22Wilhelm V. Rojas P. Gatica M. Allende C.C. Allende J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 671-676Google Scholar). In Rana temporaria during oocyte maturation, CK2 activity increases 7 h after progesterone administration and at the final stage of maturation, suggesting that CK2 participates in the translation control mechanisms during maturation of frog oocytes (23Kandror K.V. Benumov A.O. Stepanov A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 441-448Google Scholar). In contrast to these data, microinjection into Xenopus full-grown oocytes of highly purified CK2 inhibits meiosis progression induced by progesterone (24Mulner-Lorillon O. Marot J. Cayla X. Pouhle R. Belle R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 107-117Google Scholar). In addition, CK2 becomes activated before germinal vesicle breakdown in maturing echinoderm oocytes (25Sanghera J.S. Charlton L.A. Paddon H.B. Pelech S.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 829-837Google Scholar, 26Xu Z. Dholakia J.N. Hille M.B. Dev. Genet. 1993; 14: 424-439Google Scholar). During oocyte meiotic maturation in Xenopus, Cdc2, a component of maturation-promoting factor (MPF), phosphorylates several factors including CK2, supporting the view that CK2 is involved in the phosphorylation cascade originated by Cdc2 (27Belle R. Cormier P. Poulhe R. Morales J. Huchon D. MulnerLorillon O. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1990; 34: 111-115Google Scholar). The same authors also reported that Xenopus Cdc2 phosphorylates CK2-β in vitro, increasing the activity of the holoenzyme (28Mulner-Lorillon O. Cormier P. Labbe J.C. Doree M. Poulhe R. Osborne H. Belle R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 529-534Google Scholar). Finally, several CK2 substrates are expressed in oocytes (for review, see Ref. 7Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Google Scholar). Strong evidences suggest a role for CK2-β independent from the catalytic subunit in meiotic maturation. In unfertilized Xenopus oocytes, CK2-β binds and inhibits the activity of Mos (29Chen M. Li D. Krebs E.G. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1904-1912Google Scholar), a component of cytostatic factor (30Tunquist B.J. Maller J.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 683-710Google Scholar). The docking activity of CK2-β on Mos negatively regulates oocyte maturation by inhibiting the Mos-dependent activation of MAP kinase (MAPK) (31Chen M. Cooper J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9136-9140Google Scholar). The finding of a biological activity of CK2-β distinct from its role as a CK2 regulatory subunit is not novel because CK2-β might have its own function in binding and recruiting a potential substrate for CK2 holoenzyme (for review, see Ref. 3Litchfield D.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 1-15Google Scholar), or it might sequester partners not necessarily phosphorylated by CK2-α (32Boldyreff B. Issinger O.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 197-199Google Scholar, 33Gotz C. Wagner P. Issinger O.G. Montenarh M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 391-398Google Scholar). In the present work, we investigated the role of CK2 in activated oocytes, a process that takes place in mature oocytes, is dependent on fertilizing stimuli, and leads to meiosis completion (34Sagata N. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 22-28Google Scholar, 35Longo F.J. Tompa A.S. The Mollusca. 3. Academic Press, New York1983: 49-89Google Scholar, 36Tosti E. Boni R. Human Reprod. Update. 2004; 10: 1-13Google Scholar). We used oocytes from ascidian Ciona intestinalis, an organism studied intensively in developmental biology (37Satoh N. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 285-295Google Scholar) and, more recently, proposed as a model to study meiotic regulation (38Russo G.L. Wilding M. Marino M. Dale B. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 559-567Google Scholar, 39Nixon V. McDougall A. Jones K. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 187-196Google Scholar). In addition, in 2002 the draft copy of the C. intestinalis genome became publicly available, providing new insights into origin and evolution of chordates (40Dehal P. Satou Y. Campbell R.K.

Our results indicate a novel role of CK2 after oocyte activation in C. intestinalis. The enzyme activity of CK2-α oscillates during meiosis completion after fertilization independently from the activity the β subunit, engaged in forming complexes in unfertilized oocytes. Protein sequence analysis of both CK2-α and -β leads to the suggestion that the loss of Cdc2 putative phosphorylation sites on both subunits is possibly related to the meiotic arrest in metaphase I observed in C. intestinalis as well as in other invertebrates. Collection and Fertilization of Oocytes in Vitro—Metaphase I-arrested oocytes were collected from the oviducts of the ascidian C. intestinalis from the Bay of Naples and washed several times in seawater. The chorion and follicle cells were removed manually using sharp steel needles or treatment with 0.1% trypsin as described previously (42Russo G.L. Kyozuka K. Antonazzo L. Tosti E. Dale B. Development. 1996; 122: 1995-2003Google Scholar). Dechorionated oocytes were kept in 0.1% gelatin-formaldehyde-coated Petri dishes to prevent lysis of nude oocytes (43Sardet C. Speksnijder J.E. Inoue I. Jaffe L.F. Development. 1989; 105: 237-249Google Scholar). Spermatozoa were collected with a fine Pasteur pipette and diluted 1,000-fold in seawater immediately before insemination. Because of the variability of the in vitro fertilization in ascidian oocytes, the population of synchronous fertilized oocytes during meiosis ranged between 70 and 80%. Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, and SDS-PAGE—For immunoblotting of CK2-β and MAPK, unfertilized and fertilized oocytes were lysed in lysis buffer (LB) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, pH 8, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, phosphatase inhibitors (20 mm 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 40 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate), and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete by Roche Applied Science), plus 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Subsequently, cell lysates were sonicated for 20 s, centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and measured for protein concentration (44Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Total protein lysates (0.05-0.1 mg) were added with 2× Laemmli loading buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Subsequently, proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and incubated for 1 h in blocking solution made by 5% nonfat dry milk in 0.1% Tween, 25 mm Tris, pH 8, 137 mm NaCl, 2.69 mm KCl. Primary antibody solutions reported in the text and in figure legends were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature for 2 h. Bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL Plus system by Amersham Biosciences). Whole C. intestinalis cell lysates (0.5 mg of total protein) derived from unfertilized and fertilized oocytes were immunoprecipitated essentially as reported previously (46Russo G.L. Della Pietra V. Mercurio C. Della Ragione F. Marshak D.R. Oliva A. Zappia V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 673-677Google Scholar) employing 2.5 μl (1:40 v/v dilution) of an anti-pan-ERK/MAPK monoclonal antibody able to recognize phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of MAPK (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego). After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C with rocking agitation, immunocomplexes were immunoprecipitated by adding 60 μl of protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubation continued for a further 16 h. At the end of the incubation, supernatants were removed, immunocomplexes were washed twice in LB, and LDS sample preparation buffer was added (Invitrogen). Subsequently, immunocomplexes and supernatants were separated on NuPage BisTris 12% precast gel in MES buffer (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose before immunoblotting that was performed as reported above using as primary antibody Ab278, raised against a peptide spanning from residue Met140 to Gly162 of human CK2-β (46Russo G.L.

Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1217-1232Google Scholar), or anti-ERK/MAPK antibody (New England Biolabs; Beverly, MA). CK2 and MAPK Assays—CK2 activity was determined on whole cell extracts deriving from unfertilized and fertilized C. intestinalis oocytes. The reaction mixture contained in a total volume of 50 μl, 50-90 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1,500-3,000 cpm/pmol ATP) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 0.5 mm peptide substrate ETE (RRREEETEEE, amino acid sequence one letter code; Promega) in CK2 kinase buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate), as reported previously (46Russo G.L. Della Pietra V. Mercurio C. Della Ragione F. Marshak D.R. Oliva A. Zappia V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 673-677Google Scholar). Reactions were incubated for 30-40 min at 30 °Cinthe presence of 5-10 μg of crude extract and terminated by transferring the supernatants to P81 paper (Whatman) to determine phosphate incorporation on ETE peptide as described (48Marshak D.R. Carroll D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 134-156Google Scholar). When [γ-32P]GTP was used as the phosphate donor instead of [γ-32P]ATP, the final concentration in the assay was 90 μm. MAPK activity was assayed using a kit commercially available (Amersham Biosciences) based on a peptide derived from epidermal growth factor receptor and containing a highly specific MAPK phosphorylation site. The assays were performed following the manufacturer's instructions with some modifications. Briefly, 5 μl of cell lysate (corresponding to 10 μg of total proteins) was added to a reaction mixture (30-μl final volume) containing 10 μl of substrate buffer and 15 μlof[γ-32P]ATP (50 μm; 5,000 cpm/pmol). The reaction was incubated for 60 min at 30 °C and stopped by adding 10 μl of stop reagent. The amount of phosphorylated peptide was determined as described above for the CK2 kinase assay. Purification of C. intestinalis CK2 and MAPK on Gel Filtration Chromatography—Unfertilized oocytes or samples at different times from fertilization (0, 5, 20, 30 min) were lysed in LB and analyzed on a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences) equipped with a Superose 12 gel filtration column (PC 3.2/30; Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated in LB and calibrated using the following molecular mass markers (Serva): cytochrome c (12.400; 3 μg; eluted in fraction 14), ovalbumin (45.400; 4 μg; eluted in fraction 10), bovine serum albumin (67.000; 4 μg; eluted in fraction 8), and ferritin (450.000; 1 μg; eluted in fraction 4). Subsequently, 0.36 mg of cell lysate in 200 μl of LB was loaded on Superose 12 column, and proteins were eluted in the same buffer at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Fractions (100 μl) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting to detect the presence of C. intestinalis CK2-β and MAPK (CiCK2-β and CiMAPK). Aliquots of each fraction (10 μl) were used to measure kinase activity as reported above. Isolation and Sequencing of cDNA Clones—For the cloning of CK2-α and -β, total RNA was isolated from C. intestinalis ovary using the guanidine isothiocyanate/acid-phenol method (49Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar) and used to synthesize the cDNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (50Sambrook J.F. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). An aliquot of cDNA was amplified in the PCR using the degenerate oligonucleotides reported in Table I, derived from conserved regions of CK2A (coding for CK2-α) and CK2B (coding for CK2-β) genes. The PCR incubations were carried out for 36 cycles of denaturation (94 °C for 1 min), annealing (46 °C for 1 min), and elongation (72 °C for 2 min) using in the reaction mixture containing 500 pmol of each oligonucleotide, 200 μm dNTP, and a reaction buffer provided with the Taq DNA polymerase (Hoffmann-La Roche). PCR products were isolated from the agarose gel and cloned directly into the pMOS cloning vector (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. After transformation, a limited number of positive clones were selected and sequenced to identify the PCR products corresponding to CK2 fragments.Table IPrimers used to clone C. intestinalis CK2A and CK2B cDNAPrimer for cloningTargetHomologyReferencesDegenerate primers for CiCK2B5′-AA(C/T)GA(A/G)TT(C/T)TT(C/T)TG(C/T)GA-3′CiCK2BNEFFCEaSpanning from Asn26 to Glu32 of S. pombe CK2-β.685′-(A/G/T)ACCAT(A/G)AA(A/G/C/T)A(A/G)CAT(A/G)TG-3′HMLFMVbSpanning from His169 to Val174 of S. pombe CK2-β.685′-ACCCAAATCCTCACGACATCACCACAC-3′CiCK2B RACE 3′-endThis paper5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3′AUAPCommercially availablecInvitrogen.GSP1: 5′-GGGACATCTGAAAGGCCAAT-3′CiCK2B RACE 5′-endThis paperGSP2: 5′-ACAATGTCCGAAGTCACCCTGCTGGTATTT-3′CiCK2B RACE 5′-endThis paper5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG-3′Abridged anchor primerCommercially availablecInvitrogen.CiCK2B full-lengthThis paper3′-primer: 5′-TGCTACAAATTCGCCATTGA-3′CiCK2B full-lengthThis paperDegenerate primers for CiCK2A5′-GA(A/G)TA(C/T)TGGGA(C/T)TA(C/T)GA(A/G)-3′CiCK2AEYWNYEdSpanning from Glu20 to Glu25 of Drosophila CK2-α.675′-(A/G)TG(A/G)TC(A/G/T)ATCAT(A/G/C/T)AC(A/G)TT-3′NVMIDHeSpanning from Asn159 to His164 of Drosophila CK2-α.675′-GGCACTTGACTTCTGCCACAGTATGGGTAT-3′CiCK2A RACE 3′-endThis paper5′-GCCACAGTATGGGTATAATGCACAGAGATG-3′CiCK2A RACE 3′-end (nested primer)This paperGSP1: 5′-CGACGTGATCGATCATGACA-3′CiCK2A RACE 5′-endThis paperGSP2: 5′-CCCATACTGTGGCAGAAGTCAAGTGCCTTT-3′CiCK2A RACE 5′-endThis paperGSP3: 5′-TCGAACACCAACGCTGGAGTTCTGGACACT-3′CiCK2A RACE 5′-endThis paper5′-primer: 5′-ATGGCAATTCCAAGTCGTGCCCGTGTT-3′CiCK2A full-lengthThis paper3′-primer: 5′-TTAATTCATTGATTGAGCTGTGTTGGA-3′CiCK2A full-lengthThis papera Spanning from Asn26 to Glu32 of S. pombe CK2-β.b Spanning from His169 to Val174 of S. pombe CK2-β.c Invitrogen.d Spanning from Glu20 to Glu25 of Drosophila CK2-α.e Spanning from Asn159 to His164 of Drosophila CK2-α. Open table in a new tab To determine sequences at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the CiCK2A and CiCK2B mRNAs, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) assays were carried out using the 3′- and 5′-RACE system (Invitrogen). For CiCK2B, amplification of the 3′-end was carried out using an oligo(dT) containing adapter primer for first strand cDNA synthesis of poly(A)+ RNA. The first round of cDNA amplification was performed using 50 pmol each of an abridged universal amplification primer (AUAP) and a gene-specific primer (Table I). The PCR incubations were carried out for 30 cycles as follows: denaturation, 94 °C for 1 min, annealing 57 °C for 1 min, and elongation 72 °C for 1 min. The prominent band on an agarose gel was subcloned and sequenced. To amplify the CiCK2B 5′-end, 2.5 pmol of the oligonucleotide reported in Table I was used for first strand cDNA synthesis of poly(A)+ RNA. After tailing, as reported in the kit instructions, the purified single strand cDNA was amplified by the PCR using 10 pmol each of the anchor primer and the nested gene-specific oligonucleotide (Table I). PCR was performed exactly as described above for the 3′-RACE except for the annealing temperature, which was set at 50 °C. The PCR product was subcloned and sequenced. To obtain the full-length CiCK2B the two specific oligonucleotides reported in Table I were designed and used to amplify a cDNA synthesized from ovary RNA. The final size of CiCK2B cDNA was 648 bp. The RACE protocol was also applied to isolate CiCK2A. cDNA from the ovary was prepared as described above and used as template in a PCR employing 500 and 380 pmol of sense and antisense degenerate primers, respectively (Table I). The reaction was carried out with 30 cycles of denaturation (1.5 min at 94 °C), annealing (2 min at 37 °C), and elongation (2 min at 72 °C). The amplified fragments were cloned into pMOS PCR vector and sequenced. For CiCK2A, amplification of the 3′-end was carried out using an oligo(dT) containing adapter primer for first strand cDNA synthesis of poly(A)+ RNA. The first round of cDNA amplification was performed using 50 pmol each of an AUAP and a gene-specific primer (Table I). A second nested gene-specific primer (Table I) was used in a second amplification reaction in conjunction with AUAP to increase the specificity of the procedure. The first PCR incubations were carried out for 30 cycles as follows: denaturation, 94 °C for 1 min, annealing 57 °C for 1 min, and elongation 72 °C for 1 min. In the nested PCR the number of cycles was reduced to 20, and the annealing temperature was set at 52 °C. The prominent band on an agarose gel was subcloned and sequenced. To amplify the CiCK2A 5′-end, 2.5 pmol of the oligonucleotide reported in Table I was used for first strand cDNA synthesis of poly(A)+ RNA. After tailing, as reported in the kit instructions, the purified single strand cDNA was amplified by the PCR using 10 pmol each of the anchor primer and the nested gene-specific oligonucleotide (GSP2, Table I). To generate enough specific product, the original PCR was diluted (0.1 to 0.5%) and reamplified using the AUAP and a nested primer (GSP3, Table I) located at the 5′-end of the GSP2 oligonucleotide. Both PCRs were performed for 30 cycles with an annealing temperature set at 55 °C. The PCR product was subcloned and sequenced. To obtain the full-length CiCK2A the two specific oligonucleotides reported in Table I were designed and used to amplify a cDNA synthesized from ovary RNA. The final size of CiCK2A cDNA was 1,158 bp. cDNA translation was obtained using the PrettySeq program in the EMBOSS software package available on the Web (www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/Software/EMBOSS/index.html); sequence alignments were obtained using ClustalW (multiple sequence alignment) and BOXSHADE (Multiple alignments designer) software available at the Web address www.ch.embnet.org. Biochemical Characterization of CK2 in C. intestinalis Oocytes—CK2 activity was present and easily detectable in a crude extract prepared from dechorionated and unfertilized C. intestinalis oocytes. As reported in Fig. 1A, CK2 activity was linear between 1 and 12 μg of crude cell extract in an enzymatic assay performed in the presence of 90 μm ATP, similar to the kinase activity measured in a crude extract derived from rapidly proliferating tissues (51Munstermann U. Fritz G. Seitz G. Lu Y.P. Schneider H.R. Issinger O.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 251-257Google Scholar) and cell lines (46Russo G.L. Della Pietra V. Mercurio C. Della Ragione F. Marshak D.R. Oliva A. Zappia V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 673-677Google Scholar). To prove that the measured activity was imputable to CK2, we performed the kinase assay in the presence of GTP and quercetin. CK2 is among the few kinases able to utilize both ATP and GTP as phosphate donor (52Hathaway G.M. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 762-768Google Scholar). As expected, GTP was recognized as substrate by CiCK2, as well as ATP, in the enzymatic assay (Fig. 1B); the apparent Km for GTP was comparable with that measured for ATP (data not shown). In addition, quercetin, a well known CK2 inhibitor (53Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Google Scholar, 54Sarno S. de Moliner E. Ruzzene M.

J. 2003; 374: 639-646Google Scholar), at a concentration of 10 μm, inhibited CiCK2 activity with an IC50 comparable with that determined for the pure enzyme from different sources (Fig. 1C) (53Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Google Scholar). It is worthwhile to note that two CK2 inhibitors, one specific such as TBB (55Sarno S. Reddy H. Meggio F. Ruzzene M. Davies S.P. Donella-Deana A. Shugar D. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 496: 44-48Google Scholar), the other less specific, apigenin (56Song D.H. Sussman D.J. Seldin D.C. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2001; 167: 4919-4925Google Scholar), applied to the assay at the same concentration used for quercetin (10 μm), were unable to inhibit CiCK2, suggesting possible structural differences at the level of the catalytic subunit, or the presence of potential interfering factors in oocyte lysates. This observation deserves further studies in the near future. To analyze the expression of CiCK"
https://openalex.org/W2078496485,"The sensory and motor neuron-derived factor (SMDF) is a neuregulin that promotes Schwann cell proliferation and differentiation. Hence, understanding axon myelination is important to unveil the mechanisms involved in SMDF biogenesis, membrane delivery, and compartmentalization. SMDF is a type II membrane protein expressed as two distinct polypeptides of ∼40 and 83 kDa. Whether the 83-kDa polypeptide results from posttranslational modifications of the protein monomers or protein dimerization remains unknown. Here we have addressed this question and shown that the 83-kDa polypeptide is an O-glycosylated form of the protein. Deletion of the N-terminal domain fully abrogates the SMDF O-glycosylation, indicating that incorporation of O-glycans occurs in the intracellular domain of the protein. Notably, O-glycosylated forms are excluded from partitioning into lipid raft microdomains. In addition, we found that heterologously expressed SMDF monomers interact in intact living cells as evidenced from fluorescence resonance energy transfer of cyan fluorescent protein/yellow fluorescent protein·SMDF fusion proteins. A stepwise deletion approach demonstrated that SMDF self-association is primarily determined by its transmembrane segment. Notably, biochemical analysis revealed that SMDF multimers are exclusively composed of the 40-kDa polypeptide. Collectively, these findings indicate that the 40-kDa form corresponds to unmodified SMDF, which may be present as multimers, whereas the 83-kDa polypeptide is a monomeric O-glycosylated form of the protein. Furthermore, our observations imply a role for oligomerization as a potential modulator of the distribution in membrane domains and O-glycosylation of the protein.

Structurally, this protein family displays an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, which endows the members with their specific biological activity. Based on the cellular processing of these proteins, three fundamental modes of action have been assigned to the NRG-1 protein family. (i) Proteins like glial growth factor II (GGFII) are secreted to the extracellular medium and freely diffuse toward its receptors. (ii) Neuregulins such as acetylcholine receptor inducing activity (ARIA) are inserted into the plasma membrane, where they are enzymatically processed and shed to the extracellular medium. (iii) Type III neuregulins are placed in close contact with their receptors expressed in neighboring cells such as Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes (1Falls D.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 14-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 2Longart M. Buonanno A. Rev. Neurol. (Paris). 2002; 34: 91-97Google Scholar, 3Wang J.Y. Miller S.J. Falls D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2841-2851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The distinct processing mode appears to be a modulator of the neuregulin biology. For example, the activation of erbB receptors in Schwann cells by membrane-attached neuronal neuregulins evokes a differentiation and axonal myelination response. In marked contrast, secreted neuregulins induce cellular proliferation and block differentiation (4Baron W. Decker L. Colognato H. ffrench-Constant C. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 151-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Neuregulin receptors are members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family erbB. Four types of erbB receptors (erbB1-erbB4) that recognize distinct ligands and have different modes of action have been described previously (5Stein R.A. Staros J.V. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 50: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). erbB1 binds EGF, whereas erbB3 and erbB4 recognize the EGF-like domains of the neuregulin family. Ligand binding to the erbB3 and erbB4 receptors can induce the formation of homodimers or heterodimers with the erbB2 receptor subtype. erbB2 displays the presence of tyrosine kinase activity, but it does not interact with ligands (6Burden S. Yarden Y. Neuron. 1997; 18: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Structural data revealed that two EGF molecules bind to the extracellular binding domains present in dimerized erbB1 (7Burgess A.W. Cho H.S. Eigenbrot C. Ferguson K.M. Garrett T.P. Leahy D.J. Lemmon M.A. Sliwkowski M.X. Ward C.W. Yokoyama S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). A similar signaling mechanism may underlie the activity of erbB3 and erbB4 homodimers or heterodimers containing the erbB1 receptor, but not the erbB2 isoform. SMDF is a type III neuregulin expressed in the nervous system with a fundamental role in the development and proliferation of Schwann cells (8Ho W.H. Armanini M.P. Nuijens A. Phillips H.S. Osheroff P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Structurally, the protein displays the presence of three distinct domains: (i) an N-terminal cytosolic region containing putative O-glycosylation sites, (ii) a transmembrane cysteine-rich domain, and (iii) an extracellular C terminus containing the EGF-like domain and potential N-type and O-type glycosylation sites (1Falls D.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 14-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 8Ho W.H. Armanini M.P. Nuijens A. Phillips H.S. Osheroff P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an additional membrane-anchoring domain has been proposed to be present in the C terminus of the protein (9Cabedo H. Luna C. Fernandez A.M. Gallar J. Ferrer-Montiel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19905-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of the protein shows the presence of two polypeptides of distinct electrophoretic mobility, namely a fast migrating 40-kDa protein and a slow migrating 83-kDa form (10Schroering A. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30643-30650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The 83-kDa polypeptide may arise either from posttranslational modification of the monomeric 40-kDa protein or from multimerization of SMDF monomers. N- or O-type glycosylation may occur in one or several of the putative consensus motifs that incorporate glycans and are present in the SMDF protein. Similarly, monomer self-association could be mediated by the transmembrane cysteine-rich domain of the protein through intermolecular disulfide bond formation. In addition, SMDF dimerization may play a role in the juxtacrine mode of signaling proposed for type III neuregulins. Indeed, SMDF, presumably anchored to the axonal membrane, may directly interact with the dimeric neuregulin receptors expressed at the plasma membrane of the Schwann target cells (10Schroering A. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30643-30650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Here we have studied the molecular identity of the two SMDF forms, and we report that the 83-kDa polypeptide corresponds to O-glycosylated SMDF with GlcNAc as the terminal sugar. O-Glycosylation occurs in the cytosolic N terminus of the protein. Notably, O-glycosylated SMDF is not segregated into lipid rafts. In addition, we found that 40-kDa SMDF monomers self-associate in cells through the transmembrane cysteine-rich domain. Taken together, our results are consistent with a model in which the oligomerization state of SMDF influences lipid raft segregation and posttranslational modification, thus providing a potential mechanism for the activation of differential subsets of erbB receptors in target cells. Materials—Primers, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, Optiprep, and pcDNA3.1 were obtained from Invitrogen. Pfu turbo DNA polymerase was from Stratagene. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies as well as monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine clone PT-66 were obtained from Sigma. pEYFP-C1, pECFP, and the anti-GFP antibody (Living Colors A.v. peptide antibody) were from Clontech. Anti-HRGβ3 antibody and anti-GFP (agarose-conjugated) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-GAP43 monoclonal antibody was from Chemicon. ECL Plus was from Amersham Biosciences. Benzyl 2-acet-amido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside (benzyl-GalNAc) and agaroseconjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) lectin were from Sigma. Agarose-soybean agglutinin (SBA) lectin was obtained from Vector Laboratories. Production of Deletions—Constructs of SMDF fused to YFP or CFP were obtained as described previously (9Cabedo H. Luna C. Fernandez A.M. Gallar J. Ferrer-Montiel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19905-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Deletions were obtained by one-step inverse PCR with the proofreading Pfu turbo DNA polymerase and two restriction digestions. Briefly, externally oriented primers with PAC1 unique restriction sites were used to amplify the whole construct except the region to be deleted. PCR products were digested (in the amplification buffer) with 20 units of DpnI for 2 h at 37 °C to remove the methylated plasmid templates, subsequently purified and digested with PAC1. Purified digestions were religated, transformed in DH5α, and selected for kanamycin resistance. The presence of the designed deletions was verified by restriction digestion and automatic sequencing. Culture, Transfections, Immunoprecipitation, Lectin Binding, and Immunoblotting of Cell Lines—COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics. PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, and penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics. Cells were plated on 2-cm2 wells at 250,000 cells/well. After 20-24 h, cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 following the manufacturer's recommendations. YFP·SMDF immunoprecipitation was performed with an anti-GFP-agarose antibody as recommended by the supplier. For lectin binding assays, COS cells were lysed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.4% sodium deoxycholate; 0.3% SDS, and 1% Nonidet P-40, and cell extracts were incubated with 75 μl of SBA- or WGA-agarose lectins and extensively washed with lysis buffer. Immunocomplexes and lectin-bound proteins were analyzed by Western immunoblots. Proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 10% fat-free skim milk in Tris-buffered saline, and incubated with the anti-GFP antibody or with the anti-GAP43 monoclonal antibody or the anti-HRGβ3 polyclonal antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h as indicated. Membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline/Tween (0.3%), incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and developed with the ECL Plus system. Triton X-100 Flotation Experiments—Analysis of detergent-insoluble complexes in flotation gradients was performed as described by Cabedo et al. (9Cabedo H. Luna C. Fernandez A.M. Gallar J. Ferrer-Montiel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19905-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, about 2.5 × 106 transiently transfected cells were cooled on ice, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and scraped off in buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). The cells then were passed 10 times through a 29-gauge needle, extracted at 4 °C for 30 min, and brought to 35% Optiprep. One ml of the extract was sequentially overlayered with 8 ml of 30% Optiprep in 0.5× buffer A and 400 μl of buffer A in a SW41 tube. After centrifugation (178,000 × g at 4 °C for 4 h), 10 fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of the gradient; 200 μl of the three top fractions (rafts) or three bottom fractions (non-rafts) were pooled and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, pH-neutralized with 0.1 m NaOH, and analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti-HRGβ3, anti-GAP43, or anti-GFP antibodies as indicated. FRET Experiments—We used a ratiometric method modified from Ruiz-Velasco and Ikeda (11Ruiz-Velasco V. Ikeda S.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 679-692Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 or PC12 cells were cultured on 24-well plates at 2.5 × 105 cells/well and transfected with equimolar amounts of the indicated plasmids with LipofectAMINE as recommended by the supplier. After 24 h, the medium was removed and substituted with phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. Cells were observed with a fluorescence-inverted Axiovert 200 microscope and a CCD ORCA camera (Hamamatsu). Cells were excited at 440 nm with a mercury lamp, with exposition times of 200 ms and light recorded at 480 and 535 nm using the FRET set of filters and dichroic mirror for CFP/YFP (λ ≥ 455 nm, CHROMAS). A computer-controlled filter wheel (Sutter Instruments) allowed the recording of the CFP emission and YFP emission with a short delay. Images were obtained for each wavelength, and the relative amount of light for each cell was calculated using the Aquacosmos software package. Fluorescence emission at 535 nm (Ff) was plotted as a function of fluorescence emission at 480 nm (Df) giving rise to a linear distribution that was fitted to a straight line. The non-interacting, free CFP and YFP give rise to a linear distribution that can be described by a straight line with a slope of 0.91 ± 0.02 (n = 5). Thus, a slope > 1.0 was taken as an indicator of the occurrence of FRET between the donor and acceptor pairs. Data are given as mean ± S.E., with n as the number of experiments performed. The Tukey test was used for statistical analysis. SMDF Is an O-Glycosylated Protein—Electrophoretic analysis of SMDF exposes the presence of two distinct forms of 40 and 83 kDa. The molecular nature of the 83-kDa form is not yet known. Analysis of the primary sequence with the neuronal network predictor NetOGlyc (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/netO-glyc) and YingOYang 1.2 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/YinOYang) servers reveals the presence of several mucin-type GalNAc and non-mucin-type GlcNAc O-glycosylation sites in SMDF. To investigate whether the protein is O-glycosylated in cells, we incubated the SMDF-transfected COS cells with the sugar analogue benzyl-GalNAc, an inhibitor of glucosaminyltransferases (12Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1A, treatment of cells expressing the SMDF protein with the O-glycosylation inhibitor prevented the appearance of the 83-kDa polypeptide without affecting the mobility of the 40-kDa form. Note that the benzyl-GalNAc augmented the mobility of the 83-kDa form to that of the 68-kDa polypeptide, suggesting that the inhibitor did not fully block the O-glycosylation of the protein or, alternatively, that SMDF may suffer another type of posttranslational modification. A similar result was obtained when the YFP·SMDF fusion protein was used; namely, the benzyl-GalNAc increased the electrophoretic mobility of the 110-kDa form to that of the 95-kDa polypeptide, without altering the migration properties of the 68-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 1B). Thus, these results indicate the 83-kDa form of SMDF and the 110-kDa form of YFP·SMDF correspond to an O-glycosylated form of the protein. Amino acid sequence analysis displays the presence of O- glycosylatable residues throughout the protein. We first evaluated whether the O-glycosylation occurs in the N terminus of the protein. The experimental strategy considered the use of deletion mutant YFP·SMDF(Δ1-64), which lacks most of the N terminus of SMDF. Notably, truncation of the SMDF N terminus completely blocked the appearance of the higher molecular weight, O-glycosylated forms of the protein (Fig. 1C), in accordance with the tenet that O-glycosylation of SMDF occurs in its N end. Note that the lack of O-linked glycans in the truncation mutant YFP·SMDF(Δ1-64) cannot be attributed to a defect in the protein biogenesis and membrane delivery because this protein is normally produced and trafficked to the cell surface (9Cabedo H. Luna C. Fernandez A.M. Gallar J. Ferrer-Montiel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19905-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, this observation implies the absence of O-glycosylation in the putative sites present in the C terminus of the protein. To unveil the type of sugars attached to the O-glycosylated protein we took advantage of the sugar specificity of two agarose-conjugated lectins. Triticum vulgaris lectin (WGA) binds to β-O-GlcNAc-modified proteins, whereas SBA (a lectin from Glycine max) interacts with both α- and β-O-GalNAc-glycosylated proteins. Whole cell extracts from COS cells expressing SMDF were incubated with WGA- or SBA-agarose, and the presence of SMDF in the precipitates was evaluated by Western immunoblot using the anti-HRGβ3 antibody. As depicted in Fig. 1D, O-glycosylated SMDF was specifically purified by the WGA lectin, with no detectable presence of the modified protein in the SBA precipitated. The non-modified 40-kDa form of the protein did not interact with either immobilized lectin. Therefore, these results demonstrate that SMDF is mainly a β-O-GlcNAc-glycosylated protein. The O-Glycosylated Form of SMDF Does Not Partition into Lipid Raft Microdomains—We have shown previously that SMDF segregates into lipid rafts (9Cabedo H. Luna C. Fernandez A.M. Gallar J. Ferrer-Montiel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19905-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because partition in these membrane microdomains may be modulated by posttranslational modification of the proteins (12Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we questioned whether O-glycosylation of SMDF influences its insertion into membrane rafts. To address this issue we investigated whether inhibition of O-glycosylation affected the distribution of the protein in raft and non-raft microdomains. COS-7 cells were transfected with YFP·SMDF, incubated with the inhibitor where indicated, and extracted with 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. Cell extracts were centrifuged in Optiprep gradients as described previously (9Cabedo H. Luna C. Fernandez A.M. Gallar J. Ferrer-Montiel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19905-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis. This experimental paradigm identifies raft-associated proteins in the top fractions, as illustrated for the palmitoylated GAP43 protein, while non-raft proteins such as YFP are present in the bottom fractions (Fig. 2). Fig. 2A depicts that O-glycosylated SMDF was found in the bottom fractions, in agreement with previous findings indicating that this protein form does not segregate into lipid rafts (9Cabedo H. Luna C. Fernandez A.M. Gallar J. Ferrer-Montiel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19905-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Inhibition of O- glycosylation with 4.5 mm benzyl-GalNAc did not significantly augment the segregation of unmodified SMDF into lipid rafts. Notice that partially O-glycosylated SMDF does not partition into lipid rafts, suggesting that only completely non-O-glycosylated forms are able to localize in these membrane microdomains. Taken together, our results suggest that raft association is inversely related to the O-glycan posttranslational modification of the protein. SMDF Monomers Interact “in Vivo”—We also evaluated whether SMDF monomers could homodimerize. SMDF self-association is plausible because of the presence of a cysteine-rich domain N-terminally adjacent to the transmembrane segment of the protein that may favor the linkage of monomers by disulphide bridges. To address this question we first compared the electrophoretic mobility of YFP·SMDF in reducing and non-reducing conditions. Fig. 3A depicts that under non-reducing conditions YFP·SMDF migrates as three distinct bands of 68, 110, and 130 kDa. Notice that the 130-kDa band disappears when the reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol is added to the samples, thus suggesting that it may be a multimer of YFP·SMDF monomers. To further investigate the multimerization of the SMDF in vivo, we used FRET between YFP and CFP fused to SMDF as a highly sensitive assay of protein-protein interactions. The fluorescent proteins were fused to the N terminus of SMDF giving rise to YFP·SMDF and CFP·SMDF. Fusion of a fluorescent protein to the N terminus of SMDF did not affect the biological properties of SMDF (9Cabedo H. Luna C. Fernandez A.M. Gallar J. Ferrer-Montiel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19905-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression of both YFP·SMDF and CFP·SMDF produced fluorescent proteins with the spectral properties characteristic of YFP and CFP (data not shown). Fig. 3B shows the occurrence of FRET in COS cells co-expressing both CFP·SMDF and YFP·SMDF but not in cells co-transfected with CFP and YFP (Fig. 3C). FRET is readily detected as YFP fluorescence (λ = 535 nm) as a result of CFP excitation (λ = 440 nm). The plot of the emission signal measured at 535 nm (Ff) as a function of the signal measured at 480 nm (Df) using the excitation FRET filter (λ = 440 nm) is depicted in Fig. 3D. The experimental data are linearly distributed and may be fitted to a straight line with a slope of 1.25 ± 0.06 (mean ± S.D., n = 5) for the pair CFP/YFP·SMDF and 0.91 ± 0.02 (n = 5) for cytosolic CFP/YFP. Note that the slope value of the CFP/YFP·SMDF proteins was a significant ≈35% (p < 0.001) larger than that exhibited by the non-interacting pair CFP/YFP. Thus, the value of the slope (Ff/Df) can be considered an operational measurement of FRET in intact cells, in agreement with results reported by Gordon et al. (13Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). To further substantiate that Ff/Df > 1.0 is because of FRET, we tagged the subunits of the ionotropic receptor TRPV1 with CFP (CFP·TRPV1) and (YFP·TRPV1), co-transfected the fusion proteins, and obtained the plot Ffversus Df for this donor-acceptor pair (Fig. 3E). The rationale for using the TRPV1 receptor was that this receptor subunit tetramerizes giving rise to ion channels (14Kedei N. Szabo T. Lile J.D. Treanor J.J. Olah Z. Iadarola M.J. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28613-28619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Fig. 3E reveals that the slope of the pair CFP·TRPV1 and YFP·TRPV1 was 1.24 ± 0.05 (n = 4), akin to CFP·SMDF/YFP·SMDF. Taking together, our findings demonstrate that the CFP/YFP·SMDF fusion monomers interact in COS-7 cells and that they are within a distance consistent for the occurrence of FRET (1-10 nm). A similar result was obtained when CFP·SMDF and YFP·SMDF were expressed in the neuron-like PC12 cell line (Fig. 3F), implying that the SMDF monomers also interact in neurons. Therefore, SMDF appears to self-associate in vivo. The Transmembrane Cysteine-rich Domain Drives SMDF Oligomerization—We next sought to identify the molecular determinants of the SMDF monomer-monomer interaction by a stepwise deletion approach on both CFP·SMDF and YFP·SMDF fusion proteins. For this purpose, the domains comprising amino acids 108-296 (CFP/YFP·SMDF(Δ108-296)) and 65-296 (CFP/YFP·SMDF(Δ65-296)) were removed by inverse PCR (Fig. 4A). As illustrated in Fig. 4B, deletion mutant CFP/YFP·SMDF(Δ108-296) shows the presence of FRET with a slope of 1.38 ± 0.04 (n = 5). In contrast, truncation form CFP/YFP·SMDF(Δ65-296) abrogated almost completely the occurrence of FRET (1.05 ± 0.04 (n = 5)) (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the transmembrane cysteine-rich domain segment of SMDF is a molecular determinant of monomer-monomer interaction. A summary of these results is depicted in Fig. 4D. SMDF Monomers Self-associate in Cells—The strength of the interaction was evaluated by a co-immunoprecipitation strategy. For this purpose, we co-expressed the full-length SMDF with the deletion protein Δ108-296 fused to YFP. Protein complexes SMDF·YFP·SMDF(Δ108-296) were immunopurified with anti-GFP antibody and separated by SDS-PAGE, and the presence of full-length SMDF was probed with an anti-HRGβ3 antibody. Fig. 5 depicts that the SMDF protein was immunoprecipitated with the anti-GFP antibody when co-expressed with YFP·SMDF(Δ108-296). Note that only the 40-kDa form of SMDF was present in the immunoprecipitates, although similar amounts of both the 40-kDa and 83-kDa forms were noticeable in the cell extracts. Collectively, these findings are consistent with the tenet that SMDF self-association is mediated by its transmembrane domain. In addition, the lack of the 83-kDa O-glycosylated polypeptide in the immunoprecipitates implies that only the unmodified 40-kDa form of the protein self-assembles in cells. SMDF is a type II membrane protein expressed on the plasma membrane with the active EGF-like domain in the C terminus oriented to the extracellular space (10Schroering A. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30643-30650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Transfected cells expressed two distinct forms of SMDF, a fast migrating ≈40-kDa protein and a slow migrating ≈83-kDa protein, with distinct membrane compartmentalization (9Cabedo H. Luna C. Fernandez A.M. Gallar J. Ferrer-Montiel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19905-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). While the fast migrating polypeptide is located in both non-raft and raft microdomains, the higher molecular mass form does not segregate into lipid rafts. These observations imply that the distinct molecular composition of both SMDF polypeptides may be an important modulatory strategy of protein biogenesis, trafficking, and/or function. Our findings indicate that the 40-kDa form represents monomeric unmodified SMDF. In contrast, the 83-kDa polypeptide is an O-glycosylated form of SMDF monomers. Inhibition of O-glycosylation with the sugar analogue benzyl-GalNAc increased the electrophoretic mobility of the 83-kDa glycoform to that of the 68-kDa polypeptide, indicating a partial inhibition of the protein O-glycosylation. In contrast, deletion of the N terminus of SMDF resulted in full abrogation of the incorporation of O-linked glycans. Thus, these results imply that O-glycosylation occurs specifically and exclusively in the intracellular N terminus of the protein. Two major types of O-glycosylation have been described: (i) the usually intracellular O-GlcNAc type of modification and (ii) the mucin-like O-GalNAc type, which generally appears in the extracellular domains of membrane proteins (15Van den Steen P.E. Rudd P.M. Wormald M.R. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 35-49Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the O-GalNAc kind of O-glycosylation has also been documented to occur in cytosolic domains (16Hart G.W. Haltiwanger R.S. Holt G.D. Kelly W.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 841-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The fact that O-glycosylation of SMDF is partially sensitive to benzyl-GalNAc, a widely used inhibitor of the O-GalNAc type of O-glycosylation (12Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), suggests that SMDF is O-GalNAc-modified. However, by using the sugar-specific binding lectins SBA and WGA, we found that the attached sugar is mainly GlcNAc. Nonetheless, because of the selectivity of these lectins for the terminal sugar, we cannot rule out the presence of non-exposed GalNAc residues in the protein. Because intracellular O-glycosylation has been shown to play diverse physiological roles ranging from enzyme activity to control of protein-protein interactions (15Van den Steen P.E. Rudd P.M. Wormald M.R. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 35-49Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Hart G.W. Haltiwanger R.S. Holt G.D. Kelly W.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 841-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 17Jiang M.S. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2421-2428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18Vosseller K. Wells L. Hart G.W. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), our observations imply that SMDF O-glycosylation may modulate the assembly of the protein monomers. Alteration of monomer self-association will, in turn, influence SMDF subcellular localization and trafficking through regulation of its compartmentalization in membrane domains. In the course of these studies, we obtained compelling evidence that SMDF monomers self-associate in cells through the transmembrane cysteine-rich domain of SMDF. First, FRET measurements in COS-7 and PC12 cells revealed an interaction between CFP·SMDF and YFP·SMDF. Structure-function analysis by a stepwise deletion strategy identified the transmembrane segment of the protein as the fundamental determinant of the molecular interaction. It is interesting to mention that the single transmembrane domain of the erbB receptor self-associates in cell membranes (19Mendrola J.M. Berger M.B. King M.C. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), suggesting a parallelism between the oligomerization of neuregulin ligands and that of receptors. Second, multimers composed of SMDF and YFP·SMDF(Δ108-296) could be immunopurified with an anti-GFP antibody, suggesting that these proteins strongly interact in cells. Notably, only the 40-kDa polypeptide was present in the immunopurified complexes. The lack of O-glycosylated protein in the oligomers is consistent with the notion that multimerization modulates the protein O-glycosylation or vice versa. Similar linkage between intracellular domain O- glycosylation and protein-protein interactions has been described for other single span transmembrane proteins (20Zhu W. Leber B. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5999-6007Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Because only the fast migrating protein segregates into lipid rafts, our findings also imply that SMDF multimerization may be favored in these membrane microdomains as has been shown previously for other proteins (21Panchal R.G. Ruthel G. Kenny T.A. Kallstrom G.H. Lane D. Badie S.S. Li L. Bavari S. Aman M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15936-15941Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 22Cunningham O. Andolfo A. Santovito M.L. Luzzolino L. Blasi F. Sidenius N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5994-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, we found that cholesterol depletion of lipid rafts with methyl-β-cyclodextrin does not abrogate FRET of the donor-acceptor pairs CFP/YFP·SMDF or CFP/YFP·SMDF(Δ108-296) (data not shown). Moreover, the strong FRET detected for CFP/YFP·SMDF(Δ108-296), a deletion mutant that does not partition into membrane rafts (9Cabedo H. Luna C. Fernandez A.M. Gallar J. Ferrer-Montiel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19905-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), evidences that SMDF self-association also occurs in non-raft domains. These findings are similar to those reported for the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR/CD87), a protein that dimerizes in both raft and non-raft microdomains (22Cunningham O. Andolfo A. Santovito M.L. Luzzolino L. Blasi F. Sidenius N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5994-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). uPAR/CD87 dimerization is also insensitive to cholesterol depletion (22Cunningham O. Andolfo A. Santovito M.L. Luzzolino L. Blasi F. Sidenius N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5994-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Collectively, our findings are consistent with the tenet that SMDF multimerization may occur in both raft and non-raft microdomains. Further experimental data are required to unveil the specific mechanism underlying the protein multimerization. A fundamental question arises; what could be the biological relevance of these findings? Cumulative evidence shows that compartmentalization of proteins in distinct membrane domains is important for precise signaling (23El-Husseini A.E.-D. Craven S.E. Brock S.C. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44984-44992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For instance, in neurons some axon-located proteins are distributed in lipid rafts, whereas those delivered to soma and dendrites are placed in non-raft domains (24Ledesma M.D. Simons K. Dotti C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3966-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with the notion that the raft-segregated 40-kDa polypeptide may be preferentially stationed in the axon of the neuron, where it may serve as a juxtacrine signal for Schwann cells thus inducing myelination of the axon (Fig. 6). Juxtacrine signaling by type III neuregulins is a currently held hypothesis based on evidence showing that signaling by membrane-bound neuregulins can differ from signaling by soluble NRGs (1Falls D.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 14-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 25Leimeroth R. Lobsiger C. Lussi A. Taylor V. Suter U. Sommer L. Dev. Biol. 2002; 246: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because active erbB receptors are homo- or heterodimers of the different family members, dimerization of SMDF in lipid rafts may be important for its juxtacrine signaling. Yen et al. (26Yen L. Benlimame N. Nie Z.R. Xiao D. Wang T. Al Moustafa A.E. Esumi H. Milanini J. Hynes N.E. Pages G. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4029-4044Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) reported a differential biological role mediated by distinct erbB homo- and heterodimers. It is tempting to hypothesize that a dimer of ligands could bind preferably to erbB3 or erbB4 homodimers instead of erbB2 heterodimers, thus providing a mechanism of cell signaling able to discriminate diverse biological responses in target cells expressing erbB receptors. In contrast to the 40-kDa oligomeric form, the O-glycosylated 83-kDa polypeptide may be primarily targeted to soma and/or dendrites, where upon cleavage it would shed a bioactive ectodomain fragment that could act as a paracrine signal. Thus, O-glycosylation and oligomerization of SMDF would be important determinants of the signaling mode of this type III neuregulin. Future experiments in co-cultures of neurons and Schwann cells will address the proposed polarized distribution for the unmodified and O-glycosylated forms of SMDF and will elucidate its contribution to the neuregulin signaling mechanism.
