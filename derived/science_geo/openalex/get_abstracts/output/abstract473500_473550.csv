https://openalex.org/W2158113420,"Spatial priorities for the conservation of three key Mediterranean habitats, i.e. seagrass Posidonia oceanica meadows, coralligenous formations, and marine caves, were determined through a systematic planning approach. Available information on the distribution of these habitats across the entire Mediterranean Sea was compiled to produce basin-scale distribution maps. Conservation targets for each habitat type were set according to European Union guidelines. Surrogates were used to estimate the spatial variation of opportunity cost for commercial, non-commercial fishing, and aquaculture. Marxan conservation planning software was used to evaluate the comparative utility of two planning scenarios: (a) a whole-basin scenario, referring to selection of priority areas across the whole Mediterranean Sea, and (b) an ecoregional scenario, in which priority areas were selected within eight predefined ecoregions. Although both scenarios required approximately the same total area to be protected in order to achieve conservation targets, the opportunity cost differed between them. The whole-basin scenario yielded a lower opportunity cost, but the Alboran Sea ecoregion was not represented and priority areas were predominantly located in the Ionian, Aegean, and Adriatic Seas. In comparison, the ecoregional scenario resulted in a higher representation of ecoregions and a more even distribution of priority areas, albeit with a higher opportunity cost. We suggest that planning at the ecoregional level ensures better representativeness of the selected conservation features and adequate protection of species, functional, and genetic diversity across the basin. While there are several initiatives that identify priority areas in the Mediterranean Sea, our approach is novel as it combines three issues: (a) it is based on the distribution of habitats and not species, which was rarely the case in previous efforts, (b) it considers spatial variability of cost throughout this socioeconomically heterogeneous basin, and (c) it adopts ecoregions as the most appropriate level for large-scale planning."
https://openalex.org/W2132632000,"Glycan structures on glycoproteins and glycolipids play critical roles in biological recognition, targeting, and modulation of functions in animal systems. Many classes of glycan structures are capped with terminal sialic acid residues, which contribute to biological functions by either forming or masking glycan recognition sites on the cell surface or secreted glycoconjugates. Sialylated glycans are synthesized in mammals by a single conserved family of sialyltransferases that have diverse linkage and acceptor specificities. We examined the enzymatic basis for glycan sialylation in animal systems by determining the crystal structures of rat ST6GAL1, an enzyme that creates terminal α2,6-sialic acid linkages on complex-type N-glycans, at 2.4 Å resolution. Crystals were obtained from enzyme preparations generated in mammalian cells. The resulting structure revealed an overall protein fold broadly resembling the previously determined structure of pig ST3GAL1, including a CMP-sialic acid-binding site assembled from conserved sialylmotif sequence elements. Significant differences in structure and disulfide bonding patterns were found outside the sialylmotif sequences, including differences in residues predicted to interact with the glycan acceptor. Computational substrate docking and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to predict and evaluate the CMP-sialic acid donor and glycan acceptor interactions, and the results were compared with kinetic analysis of active site mutants. Comparisons of the structure with pig ST3GAL1 and a bacterial sialyltransferase revealed a similar positioning of donor, acceptor, and catalytic residues that provide a common structural framework for catalysis by the mammalian and bacterial sialyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W2075591632,"Fluorescent proteins (FPs) are widely used in biochemistry, biology and biophysics. For quantitative analysis of gene expression FPs are often used as marking molecules. Therefore, sufficient knowledge of maturation times and their affecting factors is of high interest. Here, we investigate the maturation process of the FPs GFP and mCherry expressed by the three closely related Escherichia coli strains of the Colicin E2 system, a model system for colicinogenic interaction. One strain, the C strain produces Colicin, a toxin to which the S strain is sensitive, and against which the R strain is resistant. Under the growth conditions used in this study, the S and R strain have similar growth rates, as opposed to the C strain whose growth rate is significantly reduced due to the toxin production. In combination with theoretical modelling we studied the maturation kinetics of the two FPs in these strains and could confirm an exponential and sigmoidal maturation kinetic for GFP and mCherry, respectively. Our subsequent quantitative experimental analysis revealed a high variance in maturation times independent of the strain studied. In addition, we determined strain dependent maturation times and maturation behaviour. Firstly, FPs expressed by the S and R strain mature on similar average time-scales as opposed to FPs expressed by the C strain. Secondly, dependencies of maturation time with growth conditions are most pronounced in the GFP expressing C strain: Doubling the growth rate of this C strain results in an increased maturation time by a factor of 1.4. As maturation times can vary even between closely related strains, our data emphasize the importance of profound knowledge of individual strains' maturation times for accurate interpretation of gene expression data."
https://openalex.org/W2083461135,"Understanding the factors driving innovation in energy technologies is of critical importance to mitigating climate change and addressing other energy-related global challenges. Low levels of innovation, measured in terms of energy patent filings, were noted in the 1980s and 90s as an issue of concern and were attributed to limited investment in public and private research and development (R&D). Here we build a comprehensive global database of energy patents covering the period 1970–2009, which is unique in its temporal and geographical scope. Analysis of the data reveals a recent, marked departure from historical trends. A sharp increase in rates of patenting has occurred over the last decade, particularly in renewable technologies, despite continued low levels of R&D funding. To solve the puzzle of fast innovation despite modest R&D increases, we develop a model that explains the nonlinear response observed in the empirical data of technological innovation to various types of investment. The model reveals a regular relationship between patents, R&D funding, and growing markets across technologies, and accurately predicts patenting rates at different stages of technological maturity and market development. We show quantitatively how growing markets have formed a vital complement to public R&D in driving innovative activity. These two forms of investment have each leveraged the effect of the other in driving patenting trends over long periods of time."
https://openalex.org/W2073839544,"Clinical studies have demonstrated that alcoholics have a lower dietary zinc intake compared to health controls. The present study was undertaken to determine the interaction between dietary zinc deficiency and ethanol consumption in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease. C57BL/6N mice were subjected to 8-week feeding of 4 experimental liquid diets: (1) zinc adequate diet, (2) zinc adequate diet plus ethanol, (3) zinc deficient diet, and (4) zinc deficient diet plus ethanol. Ethanol exposure with adequate dietary zinc resulted in liver damage as indicated by elevated plasma alanine aminotransferase level and increased hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammatory cell infiltration. Dietary zinc deficiency alone increased hepatic lipid contents, but did not induce hepatic inflammation. Dietary zinc deficiency showed synergistic effects on ethanol-induced liver damage. Dietary zinc deficiency exaggerated ethanol effects on hepatic genes related to lipid metabolism and inflammatory response. Dietary zinc deficiency worsened ethanol-induced imbalance between hepatic pro-oxidant and antioxidant enzymes and hepatic expression of cell death receptors. Dietary zinc deficiency exaggerated ethanol-induced reduction of plasma leptin, although it did not affect ethanol-induced reduction of white adipose tissue mass. Dietary zinc deficiency also deteriorated ethanol-induced gut permeability increase and plasma endotoxin elevation. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that dietary zinc deficiency is a risk factor in alcoholic liver disease, and multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic factors may mediate the detrimental effects of zinc deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2007534521,"Background Improvement of patient quality of life is the ultimate goal of biomedical research, particularly when dealing with complex, chronic and debilitating conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This is largely dependent on receiving an accurate and rapid diagnose, an effective treatment and in the prediction and prevention of side effects and complications. The low sensitivity and specificity of current markers burden their general use in the clinical practice. New biomarkers with accurate predictive ability are needed to achieve a personalized approach that take the inter-individual differences into consideration. Methods We performed a high throughput approach using microarray gene expression profiling of colon pinch biopsies from IBD patients to identify predictive transcriptional signatures associated with intestinal inflammation, differential diagnosis (Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis), response to glucocorticoids (resistance and dependence) or prognosis (need for surgery). Class prediction was performed with self-validating Prophet software package. Results Transcriptional profiling divided patients in two subgroups that associated with degree of inflammation. Class predictors were identified with predictive accuracy ranging from 67 to 100%. The expression accuracy was confirmed by real time-PCR quantification. Functional analysis of the predictor genes showed that they play a role in immune responses to bacteria (PTN, OLFM4 and LILRA2), autophagy and endocytocis processes (ATG16L1, DNAJC6, VPS26B, RABGEF1, ITSN1 and TMEM127) and glucocorticoid receptor degradation (STS and MMD2). Conclusions We conclude that using analytical algorithms for class prediction discovery can be useful to uncover gene expression profiles and identify classifier genes with potential stratification utility of IBD patients, a major step towards personalized therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2101862601,"Insect pollination benefits over three quarters of the world's major crops. There is growing concern that observed declines in pollinators may impact on production and revenues from animal pollinated crops. Knowing the distribution of pollinators is therefore crucial for estimating their availability to pollinate crops; however, in general, we have an incomplete knowledge of where these pollinators occur. We propose a method to predict geographical patterns of pollination service to crops, novel in two elements: the use of pollinator records rather than expert knowledge to predict pollinator occurrence, and the inclusion of the managed pollinator supply. We integrated a maximum entropy species distribution model (SDM) with an existing pollination service model (PSM) to derive the availability of pollinators for crop pollination. We used nation-wide records of wild and managed pollinators (honey bees) as well as agricultural data from Great Britain. We first calibrated the SDM on a representative sample of bee and hoverfly crop pollinator species, evaluating the effects of different settings on model performance and on its capacity to identify the most important predictors. The importance of the different predictors was better resolved by SDM derived from simpler functions, with consistent results for bees and hoverflies. We then used the species distributions from the calibrated model to predict pollination service of wild and managed pollinators, using field beans as a test case. The PSM allowed us to spatially characterize the contribution of wild and managed pollinators and also identify areas potentially vulnerable to low pollination service provision, which can help direct local scale interventions. This approach can be extended to investigate geographical mismatches between crop pollination demand and the availability of pollinators, resulting from environmental change or policy scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W2069882256,"Among the enzymes involved in NAD homeostasis, nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNAT1-3) are central to intracellular NAD formation. Although NMNAT3 is postulated to be a mitochondrial enzyme contributing to NAD-dependent organelle functioning, information on endogenous proteins is lacking. We report that in human cells a single gene nmnat3 localized on chromosome 3 codes for two mRNA splice variants NMNATv1 and FKSG76, whereas the previously reported NMNAT3v2 transcript is not present. However, NMNAT3v1 and FKSG76 proteins are not detectable, consistent with the finding that an upstream ORF in their mRNAs negatively regulates translation. NMNAT3v1 transfection demonstrates that the protein is cytosolic and inactive, whereas FKSG76 is mitochondrial but operates NAD cleavage rather than synthesis. In keeping with the lack of NMNAT3, we show that extracellular NAD, but not its metabolic precursors, sustains mitochondrial NAD pool in an ATP-independent manner. Data of the present study modify the scenario of the origin of mitochondrial NAD by showing that, in human cells, NMNAT3 is absent in mitochondria, and, akin to plants and yeast, cytosolic NAD maintains the mitochondrial NAD pool."
https://openalex.org/W2074549593,"NAT8L (N-acetyltransferase 8-like) catalyzes the formation of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) from acetyl-CoA and aspartate. In the brain, NAA delivers the acetate moiety for synthesis of acetyl-CoA that is further used for fatty acid generation. However, its function in other tissues remained elusive. Here, we show for the first time that Nat8l is highly expressed in adipose tissues and murine and human adipogenic cell lines and is localized in the mitochondria of brown adipocytes. Stable overexpression of Nat8l in immortalized brown adipogenic cells strongly increases glucose incorporation into neutral lipids, accompanied by increased lipolysis, indicating an accelerated lipid turnover. Additionally, mitochondrial mass and number as well as oxygen consumption are elevated upon Nat8l overexpression. Concordantly, expression levels of brown marker genes, such as Prdm16, Cidea, Pgc1α, Pparα, and particularly UCP1, are markedly elevated in these cells. Treatment with a PPARα antagonist indicates that the increase in UCP1 expression and oxygen consumption is PPARα-dependent. Nat8l knockdown in brown adipocytes has no impact on cellular triglyceride content, lipogenesis, or oxygen consumption, but lipolysis and brown marker gene expression are increased; the latter is also observed in BAT of Nat8l-KO mice. Interestingly, the expression of ATP-citrate lyase is increased in Nat8l-silenced adipocytes and BAT of Nat8l-KO mice, indicating a compensatory mechanism to sustain the acetyl-CoA pool once Nat8l levels are reduced. Taken together, our data show that Nat8l impacts on the brown adipogenic phenotype and suggests the existence of the NAT8L-driven NAA metabolism as a novel pathway to provide cytosolic acetyl-CoA for lipid synthesis in adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2128262111,"Background & Aims Aim of this study was to evaluate whether the PNPLA3 I148M polymorphism, previously associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk, influences the clinical presentation of HCC and survival. Methods we considered 460 consecutive HCC patients referred to tertiary care centers in Northern Italy, 353 with follow-up data. Results Homozygosity for PNPLA3 148M at risk allele was enriched in HCC patients with alcoholic liver disease or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (ALD&NAFLD: relative risk 5.9, 95% c.i. 3.5–9.9; other liver diseases: relative risk 1.9, 95% c.i. 1.1–3.4). In ALD&NAFLD patients, the PNPLA3 148M allele was associated with younger age, shorter history of cirrhosis, less advanced (Child A) cirrhosis at HCC diagnosis, and lower HCC differentiation grade (p<0.05). Homozygosity for PNPLA3 148M was associated with reduced survival in the overall series (p = 0.009), and with a higher number of HCC lesions at presentation (p = 0.007) and reduced survival in ALD&NAFLD patients (p = 0.003; median survival 30, 95% c.i. 20–39 vs. 45, 95% c.i. 38–52 months), but not in those with HCC related to other etiologies (p = 0.86; 48, 95% c.i. 32–64 vs. 55, 95% c.i. 43–67 months). At multivariate Cox regression analysis, homozygosity for PNPLA3 148M was the only negative predictor of survival in ALD&NAFLD patients (HR of death 1.57, 95% c.i. 1.12–2.78). Conclusions PNPLA3 148M is over-represented in ALD&NAFLD HCC patients, and is associated with occurrence at a less advanced stage of liver disease in ALD&NAFLD. In ALD&NAFLD, PNPLA3 148M is associated with more diffuse HCC at presentation, and with reduced survival."
https://openalex.org/W2058886712,"SOX9 is a transcription factor that acts as a key regulator at various stages of cartilage differentiation. There is ample evidence that intracellular SOX9 protein levels are tightly regulated both by sumoylation and by degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Using a proteomics approach, here we report the identification of a SOX9-binding protein, E6-AP/UBE3A, that may act as a ubiquitin ligase toward Sox9. E6-AP bound SOX9 through the region consisting mostly of its high mobility group domain in vitro. In nuclear lysates, FLAG-tagged E6-AP coprecipitated with Sox9 and its high mobility group domain. This finding was estimated using nuclear lysates from a chondrocytic cell line that endogenously expresses E6-AP and SOX9. Accordingly, ectopically expressed E6-AP and SOX9 colocalized in the nucleus. We show that E6-AP ubiquitinates SOX9 in vitro and in vivo and that SOX9 levels are enhanced after addition of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Similar, siRNA knockdown of E6-AP and the E2 ligase Ubc9 increased cellular SOX9 amounts, supporting the notion that SOX9 may be ubiquitinated in hypertrophic chondrocytes by E6-AP and degraded by proteasomes. This is in accordance with the distribution of SOX9 levels, which are high in proliferating and prehypertrophic chondrocytes but low in hypertrophic chondrocytes, whereas E6-AP levels are high in hypertrophic chondrocytes and low in prehypertrophic chondrocytes. Furthermore, E6-AP-deficient mice showed SOX9 accumulation in chondrocytes and the brain. These findings support the concept that E6-AP regulates SOX9 levels in developing cartilage by acting as a ubiquitin ligase.

https://openalex.org/W2089050168,"Aquaculture activities are embedded in complex social-ecological systems. However, aquaculture development decisions have tended to be driven by revenue generation, failing to account for interactions with the environment and the full value of the benefits derived from services provided by local ecosystems. Trade-offs resulting from changes in ecosystem services provision and associated impacts on livelihoods are also often overlooked. This paper proposes an innovative application of Bayesian belief networks - influence diagrams - as a decision support system for mediating trade-offs arising from the development of shrimp aquaculture in Thailand. Senior experts were consulted (n = 12) and primary farm data on the economics of shrimp farming (n = 20) were collected alongside secondary information on ecosystem services, in order to construct and populate the network. Trade-offs were quantitatively assessed through the generation of a probabilistic impact matrix. This matrix captures nonlinearity and uncertainty and describes the relative performance and impacts of shrimp farming management scenarios on local livelihoods. It also incorporates export revenues and provision and value of ecosystem services such as coastal protection and biodiversity. This research shows that Bayesian belief modeling can support complex decision-making on pathways for sustainable coastal aquaculture development and thus contributes to the debate on the role of aquaculture in social-ecological resilience and economic development."
https://openalex.org/W2021714722,"Although the agmatine deiminase system (AgDI) has been investigated in Enterococcus faecalis, little information is available with respect to its gene regulation. In this study we demonstrate that the presence of exogenous agmatine induces the expression of agu genes in this bacterium. In contrast to the homologous and extensively characterized AgDI system of S. mutants, the aguBDAC operon in E. faecalis is not induced in response to low pH. In spite of this, agmatine catabolism in this bacterium contributes by neutralizing the external medium while enhancing bacterial growth. Our results indicate that carbon catabolic repression (CCR) operates on the AgDI system via a mechanism that involves interaction of CcpA and P-Ser-HPr with a cre site found in an unusual position considering the aguB promoter (55 nt upstream the +1 position). In addition, we found that components of the mannose phosphotransferase (PTSMan) system also contributed to CCR in E. faecalis since a complete relief of the PTS-sugars repressive effect was observed only in a PTSMan and CcpA double defective strain. Our gene context analysis revealed that aguR is present in oral and gastrointestinal microorganisms. Thus, regulation of the aguBDAC operon in E. faecalis seems to have evolved to obtain energy and resist low pH conditions in order to persist and colonize gastrointestinal niches."

We determined which hypoglycemic drugs were recommended in each guideline, and explored the relationship between specific disclosures and whether a drug was recommended.Among 13 included guidelines, the percentage of authors with one or more financial disclosures varied from 0 to 94% (mean 44.2%), and was particularly high for two US-based guidelines (91% and 94%). Three guidelines disclosed no author financial COI. The percentage of authors with disclosures of financial interests in manufacturers of recommended drugs was also high (mean 30%). On average, 56% of manufacturers of patented drugs recommended in each guideline had one or more authors with a financial interest in their company. We did not find a significant relationship between financial interests and whether a drug was recommended in our sample; US-based guidelines were more likely to make recommendations for a specific drug compared to non-US based guidelines.Authors of this cohort of guidelines have financial interests directly related to the drugs that they are recommending. Although we did not find an association between author COI and drugs recommended in these guidelines and we cannot draw conclusions about the validity of the recommendations, the credibility of many of these guidelines is in doubt."
https://openalex.org/W2026561422,"Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis of a toxic role played by wild type SOD1 (WT-SOD1) in the pathogenesis of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SALS). In this study we investigated both distribution and expression profile of WT-SOD1 in leukocytes from 19 SALS patients and 17 healthy individuals. Immunofluorescence experiments by confocal microscopy showed that SOD1 accumulates in the nuclear compartment in a group of SALS subjects. These results were also confirmed by western blot carried out on soluble nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, with increased nuclear SOD1 level (p<0.05). In addition, we observed the presence of cytoplasmic SOD1 aggregates in agreement with an increased amount of the protein recovered by the insoluble fraction. A further confirmation of the overall increased level of SOD1 has been obtained from single cells analysis using flow cytometry as cells from SALS patients showed an higher SOD1 protein content (p<0.05). These findings add further evidence to the hypothesis of an altered WT-SOD1 expression profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with ALS suggesting that WT-SOD1 species with different degrees of solubility could be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease."

PvuII SNP (C/T rs2234693) of ESR1 was described to be associated with the occurrence of IS in the Chinese population; however, two replication studies did not confirm the findings. The ESR1 SNPs have never been studied in Caucasian IS patients.Case-control study. 287 females with IS underwent clinical, radiological and genetic examinations. The patients were divided into three groups according to curve progression velocity: non-progressive IS, slowly progressive IS (progression <1° per month), and rapidly progressive IS (progression ≥1° per month). The radiological maximum Cobb angle was measured and surgery rate established. A control group consisted of 182 healthy females.All results followed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In the case-control study, genotype frequency in the patients did not differ for the XbaI (AA = 33.5%, AG = 49.1%, GG = 17.4%), nor for the PvuII (TT = 26.8%, TC = 50.2%, CC = 23.0%) comparing to controls (AA = 33.5%, AG = 50.5%, GG = 15.9%) and (TT = 23.1%, TC = 51.1%, CC = 25.8%), respectively, p = 0.3685, p = 0.6046.

https://openalex.org/W2040576393,"Interleukin (IL)-27 is a member of the IL-6/IL-12 cytokine family and possesses potent antitumor activity, which is mediated by multiple mechanisms. Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 is the critical sensor of the innate immune system that serves to identify viral double-stranded RNA. TLR3 is frequently expressed by various types of malignant cells, and recent studies reported that a synthetic TLR3 agonist, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], induces antitumor effects on malignant cells. In the present study, we have explored the effect of IL-27 on human melanomas and uncovered a previously unknown mechanism. We found that IL-27 inhibits in vitro tumor growth of human melanomas and greatly enhances the expression of TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) in a dose-dependent manner. Neutralizing antibody against TRAIL partly but significantly blocked the IL-27-mediated inhibition of tumor growth. In addition, IL-27 and poly(I:C) cooperatively augmented TRAIL expression and inhibited tumor growth. The cooperative effect could be ascribed to the augmented expression of TLR3, but not retinoic acid-inducible gene-I or anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5, by IL-27. The inhibition of tumor growth by the combination was also significantly abrogated by anti-TRAIL neutralizing antibody. Moreover, IL-27 and poly(I:C) cooperatively suppressed in vivo tumor growth of human melanoma in immunodeficient mice. Taken together, these results suggest that IL-27 enhances the expression of TRAIL and TLR3 in human melanomas and inhibits their tumor growth in cooperation with poly(I:C), partly in a TRAIL-dependent manner. Thus, IL-27 and the combination of IL-27 and poly(I:C) may be attractive candidates for cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2037975173,"The Australian intertidal ant, Polyrhachis sokolova lives in mudflat habitats and nests at the base of mangroves. They are solitary foraging ants that rely on visual cues. The ants are active during low tides at both day and night and thus experience a wide range of light intensities. We here ask the extent to which the compound eyes of P. sokolova reflect the fact that they operate during both day and night. The ants have typical apposition compound eyes with 596 ommatidia per eye and an interommatidial angle of 6.0°. We find the ants have developed large lenses (33 µm in diameter) and wide rhabdoms (5 µm in diameter) to make their eyes highly sensitive to low light conditions. To be active at bright light conditions, the ants have developed an extreme pupillary mechanism during which the primary pigment cells constrict the crystalline cone to form a narrow tract of 0.5 µm wide and 16 µm long. This pupillary mechanism protects the photoreceptors from bright light, making the eyes less sensitive during the day. The dorsal rim area of their compound eye has specialised photoreceptors that could aid in detecting the orientation of the pattern of polarised skylight, which would assist the animals to determine compass directions required while navigating between nest and food sources."

Three humic-like substances (C1, C2, C4) and one protein-like substance (C3) were identified by PARAFAC model. C1, C2 and C4 exhibited same trends and were very similar. The separation of samples on both axes of the PCA showed the difference in DOM properties. C1, C2 and C4 concurrently showed higher positive factor 1 loadings, while C3 showed highly positive factor 2 loadings. The PCA analysis showed a combination contribution of microbial DOM signal and terrestrial DOM signal in the Yangtze estuary. Higher and more variable DOM abundance, aromaticity and molecular weight of surface sediment pore water DOM can be found in the southern nearshore than the other regions primarily due to the influence of frequent and intensive human activities and tributaries inflow in this area. The DOM abundance, aromaticity, molecular weight and fluorescence intensity in core of different depth were relative constant and increased gradually with depth. DOM in core was mainly composed of humic-like material, which was due to higher release of the sedimentary organic material into the porewater during early diagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2024810746,"Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) exhibit hyperproliferation and overexpression of cell cycle proteins. We earlier showed that small peptide fragments of cytoplasmic domain of natriuretic receptor-C (NPR-C) attenuate vasoactive peptide-induced hyperproliferation of VSMC. The present study investigated if C-ANP4–23, a specific agonist of NPR-C, could attanuate the hyperproliferation of VSMC from SHR by inhibiting the overexpression of cell cycle proteins and examine the underlying signaling pathways contributing to this inhibition. The proliferation of VSMC was determined by [3H] thymidine incorporation and the expression of proteins was determined by Western blotting. The hyperproliferation of VSMC from SHR and overexpression of cyclin D1,cyclin A, cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2), phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb), Giα proteins and enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT exhibited by VSMC from SHR were attenuated by C-ANP4–23 to control levels. In addition, in vivo treatment of SHR with C-ANP4–23 also attenuated the enhanced proliferation of VSMC. Furthemore, PD98059, wortmannin and pertussis toxin, the inhibitors of MAP kinase, PI3kinase and Giα proteins respectively, also attenuated the hyperproliferation of VSMC from SHR and overexpression of cell cycle proteins to control levels. These results indicate that NPR-C activation by C-ANP4–23 attenuates the enhanced levels of cell cycle proteins through the inhibition of enhanced expression of Giα proteins and enhanced activation of MAPkinase/PI3kinase and results in the attenuation of hyperproliferation of VSMC from SHR. It may be suggested that C-ANP4–23 could be used as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of vascular complications associated with hypertension, atherosclerosis and restenosis."
https://openalex.org/W2053580757,"Ames dwarf (Prop1 (df/df) ) mice are remarkably long-lived and exhibit many characteristics of delayed aging and extended healthspan. Caloric restriction (CR) has similar effects on healthspan and lifespan, and causes an extension of longevity in Ames dwarf mice. Our study objective was to determine whether Ames dwarfism or CR influence neuromusculoskeletal function in middle-aged (82 ± 12 weeks old) or old (128 ± 14 w.o.) mice. At the examined ages, strength was improved by dwarfism, CR, and dwarfism plus CR in male mice; balance/ motor coordination was improved by CR in old animals and in middle-aged females; and agility/ motor coordination was improved by a combination of dwarfism and CR in both genders of middle-aged mice and in old females. Therefore, extension of longevity by congenital hypopituitarism is associated with improved maintenance of the examined measures of strength, agility, and motor coordination, key elements of frailty during human aging, into advanced age. This study serves as a particularly important example of knowledge related to addressing aging-associated diseases and disorders that results from studies in long-lived mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1964360677,"We used DNA-based pyrosequencing to characterize the bacterial community structure of the sandy soil of an apple orchard with different manure ratios. Five manure percentages (5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25%) were examined. More than 10,000 valid reads were obtained for each replicate. The communities were composed of five dominant groups (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes), of which Proteobacteria content gradually decreased from 41.38% to 37.29% as manure ratio increased from 0% to 25%, respectively. Redundancy analysis showed that 37 classes were highly correlated with manure ratio, 18 of which were positively correlated. Clustering revealed that the rhizosphere samples were grouped into three components: low manure (control, 5%) treatment, medium manure (10%, 15%) treatment and high manure (20%, 25%) treatment. Venn analysis of species types of these three groups revealed that the bacteria community difference was primarily reflected by quantity ratio rather than species variety. Although greater manure content led to higher soil organic matter content, the medium manure improved soil showed the highest urease activity and saccharase activity, while 5% to 20% manure ratio improvement also resulted in higher bacteria diversity than control and 25% manure ratio treatment. Our experimental results suggest that the use of a proper manure ratio results in significantly higher soil enzyme activity and different bacteria community patterns, whereas the use of excessive manure amounts has negative effect on soil quality."
https://openalex.org/W2040723452,"Angiotensin II has progressively been considered to play an important role in the development of liver fibrosis, although the mechanism isn't fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible pro-fibrotic mechanism, by which angiotensin II would enhance the pro-fibrotic effect of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) through up-regulation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and enhancing down-regulation of TGF-β1 inhibitory pseudo-receptor—BAMBI caused by LPS in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Firstly, the synergistic effects of angiotensin II, TGF-β1 and LPS on collagen 1α production were confirmed in vitro by ELISA, in which angiotensin II, LPS and TGF-β1 were treated sequentially, and in vivo by immunofluorescence, in the experiments single or multiple intra-peritoneally implanted osmotic mini-pumps administrating angiotensin II or LPS combined with intra-peritoneal injections of TGF-β1 were used. We also found that only LPS and TGF-β1 weren't enough to induce obvious fibrogenesis without angiotensin II. Secondly, to identify the reason of why angiotensin II is so important, the minute level of TLR4 in activated HSCs - T6 and primary quiescent HSCs of rat, up-regulation of TLR4 by angiotensin II and blockage by different angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) blockers in HSCs were assayed by western blotting in vitro and immunofluorescence in vivo. Finally, BAMBI expression level, which is regulated by LPS-TLR4 pathway, was detected by qRT-PCR and results showed angiotensin II enhanced the down-regulation of BAMBI mRNA caused by LPS in vitro and in vivo, and TLR4 neutralization antibody blocked this interactive effect. These data demonstrated that angiotensin II enhances LPS-TLR4 pathway signaling and further down-regulates expression of BAMBI through up-regulation of TLR4, which results in facilitation of pro-fibrotic activity of TGF-β1. Angiotensin II, LPS and TGF-β1 act synergistically during hepatic fibrogenesis, showing crosstalks between angiotensin II-AT1, LPS-TLR4 and TGF-β1-BAMBI signal pathways in rat HSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2141328426,"Past ecological responses of mammals to climate change are recognized in the fossil record by adaptive significance of morphological variations. To understand the role of dietary behavior on functional adaptations of dental morphology in rodent evolution, we examine evolutionary change of tooth shape in late Miocene Siwalik murine rodents, which experienced a dietary shift toward C4 diets during late Miocene ecological change indicated by carbon isotopic evidence. Geometric morphometric analysis in the outline of upper first molars captures dichotomous lineages of Siwalik murines, in agreement with phylogenetic hypotheses of previous studies (two distinct clades: the Karnimata and Progonomys clades), and indicates lineage-specific functional responses to mechanical properties of their diets. Tooth shapes of the two clades are similar at their sympatric origin but deviate from each other with decreasing overlap through time. Shape change in the Karnimata clade is associated with greater efficiency of propalinal chewing for tough diets than in the Progonomys clade. Larger body mass in Karnimata may be related to exploitation of lower-quality food items, such as grasses, than in smaller-bodied Progonomys. The functional and ecophysiological aspects of Karnimata exploiting C4 grasses are concordant with their isotopic dietary preference relative to Progonomys. Lineage-specific selection was differentially greater in Karnimata, and a faster rate of shape change toward derived Karnimata facilitated inclusion of C4 grasses in the diet. Sympatric speciation in these clades is most plausibly explained by interspecific competition on resource utilization between the two, based on comparisons of our results with the carbon isotope data. Interspecific competition with Karnimata may have suppressed morphological innovation of the Progonomys clade. Pairwise analyses of morphological and carbon isotope data can uncover ecological causes of sympatric speciation and define functional adaptations of teeth to resources."
https://openalex.org/W2043095261,"Sugar, the most popular sweetener, is essential in daily food. However, excessive sugar intake has been associated with several lifestyle-related diseases. Finding healthier and more economical alternatives to sugars and artificial sweeteners has received increasing attention to fulfill the growing demand. Brazzein, which comes from the pulp of the edible fruit of the African plant Pentadiplandra brazzeana Baill, is a protein that is 2,000 times sweeter than sucrose by weight. Here we report the production of transgenic mice that carry the optimized brazzein gene driven by the goat Beta-casein promoter, which specifically directs gene expression in the mammary glands. Using western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry, we confirmed that brazzein could be efficiently expressed in mammalian milk, while retaining its sweetness. This study presents the possibility of producing plant protein-sweetened milk from large animals such as cattle and goats."
https://openalex.org/W2000176216,"Protein S-acyltransferases (PATs) containing Asp-His-His-Cys within a Cys-rich domain (DHHC-CRD) are polytopic transmembrane proteins that are found in eukaryotic cells and mediate the S-acylation of target proteins. S-acylation is an important secondary and reversible modification that regulates the membrane association, trafficking and function of target proteins. However, little is known about the characteristics of PATs in plants. Here, we identified 804 PATs from 31 species with complete genomes. The analysis of the phylogenetic relationships suggested that all of the PATs fell into 8 groups. In addition, we analysed the phylogeny, genomic organization, chromosome localisation and expression pattern of PATs in Arabidopsis, Oryza sative, Zea mays and Glycine max. The microarray data revealed that PATs genes were expressed in different tissues and during different life stages. The preferential expression of the ZmPATs in specific tissues and the response of Zea mays to treatments with phytohormones and abiotic stress demonstrated that the PATs play roles in plant growth and development as well as in stress responses. Our data provide a useful reference for the identification and functional analysis of the members of this protein family."

The study objective is to obtain a better understanding of physician practices and experiences with molluscum contagiosum in order to focus informational and guidance material.A cross-sectional survey to assess medical practitioners' knowledge and practices with molluscum contagiosum was conducted using the 2009 DocStyles survey. Questions regarding category and number of molluscum contagiosum patients seen, treatments used and advice given to patients were included in the survey.Dermatologists saw the most cases, with the majority seeing 51-100 molluscum contagiosum cases/year. The most common cases seen were children with multiple lesions and adults with genital lesions. Respondents were most likely to recommend treatment to immunocompromised individuals, HIV patients, adults with genital lesions and children with multiple lesions. Cryotherapy was the top choice for all specialties with the exception of OB/GYNs, whose top choice was curettage. ""Avoid intimate contact until lesions resolve"", ""Avoid touching lesions to reduce further spread"", and ""Don't be concerned, this will go away"" were the top advice choices.Most survey respondents have dealt with molluscum contagiosum in their practice during the previous year. Overall, respondents picked appropriate choices for treatment and advice given; however some ineffective or unnecessary treatments were chosen and recommendations to prevent spread were chosen infrequently. Knowledge gaps for appropriate transmission precaution advice might cause unnecessary spread or autoinoculation. This survey has demonstrated that molluscum contagiosum is a common infection seen by many types of practitioners and therefore guidance on treatment considerations and infection control is valuable."
https://openalex.org/W2095204882,"Secondary transporters in the excitatory amino acid transporter family terminate glutamatergic synaptic transmission by catalyzing Na+-dependent removal of glutamate from the synaptic cleft. Recent structural studies of the aspartate-specific archaeal homolog, GltPh, suggest that transport is achieved by a rigid body, piston-like movement of the transport domain, which houses the substrate-binding site, between the extracellular and cytoplasmic sides of the membrane. This transport domain is connected to an immobile scaffold by three loops, one of which, the 3–4 loop (3L4), undergoes substrate-sensitive conformational change. Proteolytic cleavage of the 3L4 was found to abolish transport activity indicating an essential function for this loop in the transport mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that despite the presence of fully cleaved 3L4, GltPh is still able to sample conformations relevant for transport. Optimized reconstitution conditions reveal that fully cleaved GltPh retains some transport activity. Analysis of the kinetics and temperature dependence of transport accompanied by direct measurements of substrate binding reveal that this decreased transport activity is not due to alteration of the substrate binding characteristics but is caused by the significantly reduced turnover rate. By measuring solute counterflow activity and cross-link formation rates, we demonstrate that cleaving 3L4 severely and specifically compromises one or more steps contributing to the movement of the substrate-loaded transport domain between the outward- and inward-facing conformational states, sparing the equivalent step(s) during the movement of the empty transport domain.

In a simple kinetic scheme for GltPh; l-Asp and three Na+ ions bind to the outward-facing state (OFS) (Fig. 1B, step 1), facilitating this dramatic conformational change and resulting in a piston-like movement of the substrate-binding site across the membrane (Fig. 1B, step 2). In our scheme, this step includes the formation of an occluded outward-facing state (“closing,” perhaps by HP2 closure), the large scale translocation of the domain, and the transition from “inward-occluded” to “inward-open” substrate-bound states (“opening”). The substrates are released into the cytoplasm from this inward-facing state (IFS) (Fig. 1B, step 3), and the empty transport domain transitions from the IFS back to OFS to restart the cycle (Fig. 1B, step 4; note that in the mammalian isoforms K+ is bound for this step). This return step also presumably includes closing and opening steps to permit the translocation step of the occluded apo-transporter (whose structure was recently published (19Jensen S. Guskov A.

Comparison of the outward-facing and inward-facing crystal structures reveals distinct conformational changes in 2–3 and 5–6 loops; however, 3L4 was either unresolved or involved in lattice-packing interactions, meaning that the true structure of 3L4 is unknown (7Yernool D.

The 21-amino acid, proline-rich 3L4 undergoes substrate-dependent conformational changes, as demonstrated by limited trypsin proteolysis analysis and fluorescein 5-maleimide accessibility experiments (20Compton E.L. Taylor E.M. Mindell J.A. The 3–4 loop of an archaeal glutamate transporter homolog experiences ligand-induced structural changes and is essential for transport.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 12840-12845Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cleaving the protein backbone within 3L4, by means of an engineered Factor X protease recognition site, resulted in almost complete loss of transport activity despite the protein maintaining its structural integrity (20Compton E.L.

In this work, we probe the role of 3L4 in the mechanism of l-Asp transport by GltPh using cross-linking, binding, and transport assays. We demonstrate that cleaving 3L4 specifically inhibits one of the components of the translocation step of the substrate-loaded transport domain of GltPh while sparing the equivalent component of the translocation of the substrate-free apo-translocation domain, a conclusion with important implications for the overall mechanism of transport. All mutations were made using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies), and all cysteine substitutions were introduced into a Cys-less GltPh mutant wherein the single native cysteine had been mutated to serine (C321S), which is fully active (20Compton E.L.

A culture of Escherichia coli TOP10 cells harboring the appropriate expression vector was grown to mid-log phase, and expression was induced by addition of 0.1% (w/v) l-arabinose. Cells were lysed by sonication, and membranes were isolated by multiple centrifugation steps. Membranes containing overexpressed His-tagged protein were solubilized by addition of n-dodecyl β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM, Anatrace) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm l-glutamate, 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and 2 mm DDM. Contaminants were removed by washing with 20 column volumes of the same buffer plus 40 mm imidazole. Bound protein was eluted by addition of the same buffer plus 250 mm imidazole. The His tag was removed by incubation overnight at room temperature with thrombin in a ratio of 10 units/mg protein. Thrombin digestion was quenched by addition of 10 mm EDTA and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride. Reconstitution of GltPh was achieved using the process pioneered by Rigaud and co-workers (21Lévy D. Gulik A. Bluzat A. Rigaud J.L.

Pre-formed liposomes were partially solubilized with Triton X-100, and protein was added resulting in co-micellization of the constituents, and detergent was removed using polystyrene beads (Biobeads SM-2). After obtaining inconsistent transport rates, we thoroughly examined the variables involved and found that to obtain high activity proteoliposomes we needed to do the following: (a) add Triton X-100 from a 10% (w/v) solution of instead of adding from the 100% detergent stock, and (b) use the light scattering curve to determine the correct detergent ratio for each batch reconstitution rather than using a fixed and pre-determined Triton X-100/lipid ratio. A 3:1 ratio of E. coli polar lipid extract and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti Polar Lipids) was mixed, dried, and resuspended to 10 mg/ml in Inside Buffer (20 mm Tris/HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm NaCl, and 199 mm KCl), unless indicated otherwise. The lipid suspension was freeze-thawed five times, extruded, and then diluted to 4 mg/ml. Aliquots of 10% Triton X-100 were added to the liposomes, and incorporation was monitored using absorbance at 540 nm. Upon saturation of the liposomes with Triton X-100, purified protein was added in a ratio of 3 μg of protein/mg of lipid. Detergent was removed by multiple additions of Biobeads SM-2 polystyrene beads (Bio-Rad). Liposomes were separated from Biobeads and collected by ultracentrifugation. Proteoliposomes were resuspended in Inside Buffer to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml (lipid content), snap-frozen, and stored at −80 °C. Proteoliposomes were thawed, extruded through a 400-nm filter, collected by ultracentrifugation, and resuspended to a final lipid concentration of 100 mg/ml. In a standard transport assay, the reaction was initiated by diluting proteoliposomes 150-fold into reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 μm valinomycin, and 100 nm l-[3H]Asp at 30 °C. 200-μl samples were taken periodically and quenched by addition of 2 ml of ice-cold quench buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm LiCl. The quenched reaction was applied to a nitrocellulose filter (Millipore) over a vacuum manifold and then washed with 2 ml of quench buffer. The nitrocellulose filters were dissolved with 3 ml of FilterCount liquid scintillation mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and radioactivity was counted using a TriLux beta counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The solute counterflow assay was performed in the same way except the proteoliposomes were loaded with buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm l-Asp by multiple freeze/thaw cycles and extrusion through a 400-nm filter. The reaction buffer contained 20 mm Tris/HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 nm l-[3H]Asp. Purified GltPh variants were exchanged into Factor Xa digestion buffer (10 mm Tris/HEPES, pH 8, 5 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl and 2 mm DDM). Factor X (New England Biolabs) was added in a ratio of 125 μg/1 mg of protein and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. To discourage the stabilization of the IFS by disulfide formation between the cysteines introduced at positions 55 and 364 during the 24-h incubation, where applicable we added 1 mm l-Asp to the reaction. Factor X digestion was stopped by addition of 10 mm EDTA and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride. Control samples that were not digested with Factor X were treated in an identical fashion. Following purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and digestion by Factor X (both described previously), GltPhXa was further purified and exchanged into binding buffer (20 mm Tris/HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm choline chloride, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm DDM) using size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 10/300 GL). 0.2 μm protein was incubated with a range of l-[3H]Asp concentrations (made up in the same buffer) for 2 h at room temperature. Binding was quenched, and protein was precipitated by addition of ice-cold 50% ammonium sulfate. Precipitated protein was applied to a nitrocellulose filter over a vacuum manifold and washed with 2 ml of 50% ammonium sulfate. The filters were dissolved in 3 ml of FilterCount liquid scintillation mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and radioactivity was counted using TriLux beta counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Background binding of radiolabeled substrate was measured by performing the same experiment in the absence of protein. Binding curves are fit to a single site saturation model as shown in Equation 1, y=BmaxXKd+X(Eq. 1) Protein was cross-linked with 1,1-methanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate (MTS-1-MTS, Toronto Research Chemicals) by first exchanging the protein into buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDT, and 2 mm DDM and then, unless stated otherwise, incubating a 10 μm protein solution with 50 μm cross-linker (dissolved DMSO). Uncross-linked controls were treated in the same way but with an equivalent volume of DMSO instead of MTS-1-MTS. The cross-linking reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and quenched by addition of 100 mm S-methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS, Sigma). The cross-linking time courses were performed at room temperature. Cross-linking time course data were fit to a single exponential model described by Equation 2, Y=Y0+a(1-e-kx)(Eq. 2) where Y0 is the Y value at time 0; a is the amplitude of the curve, and k is the rate constant. We first set out to explore the effects of 3L4 cleavage on protein conformational sampling by using Hg2+-based cross-linking, which is a well established method used successfully with GltPh (8Verdon G. Boudker O. Crystal structure of an asymmetric trimer of a bacterial glutamate transporter homolog.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 9Reyes N. Ginter C. Boudker O. Transport mechanism of a bacterial homologue of glutamate transporters.Nature. 2009; 462: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 22Reyes N. Oh S. Boudker O. Binding thermodynamics of a glutamate transporter homolog.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, not only are false-positives an issue with Hg2+ cross-linking, wherein Hg2+-induced protein band shifts are observed when no cross-link is formed (8Verdon G. Boudker O. Crystal structure of an asymmetric trimer of a bacterial glutamate transporter homolog.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), but it is also difficult to quench the Hg2+ cross-linking reaction with commonly used quenching compounds, such as N-ethylmaleimide or MMTS. In the absence of a quenching reagent, when attempting to cross-link cleaved GltPh in detergent solution, we observed protein bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels corresponding to cross-link formation between intra-protein fragments and also, surprisingly, inter-subunit fragments. We reasoned that unwanted cross-linking was occurring between unreacted cysteines and residual Hg2+ ions in the quasi-denatured environment of the SDS-polyacrylamide gel or sample buffer. This led to difficulties in differentiating genuine intramolecular cross-link products from intact protein and cross-linking artifacts. We therefore switched to using the homobifunctional thiol-reactive reagent, MTS-1-MTS (linker length ∼5 Å), which we could effectively and rapidly quench with an excess of MMTS. Indeed, pre-treatment of detergent-solubilized GltPhXaC2 with MMTS prevented any cross-linking from taking place between the cysteines introduced at positions 55 and 364 even in intact protein. Densitometric SDS-PAGE band analysis was performed using Alphaview software (Cell Biosciences). Each protein band was selected using identically sized boxes, and background values were obtained by selecting an identically sized box from a blank region of the gel directly below the band. Values were normalized to a control protein band of known amount. The observed reduction in transport activity by GltPh cleaved at residue 125 in the 3L4 may be due to a decrease in the protein's ability to sample particular states in the transport cycle, to changes in its ability to bind substrate or Na+, to changes in transition rates between two or more cycle states, or a combination thereof. We sought here to distinguish among these possibilities. The transition of the GltPh transport domain between the outward- and inward-facing conformations is a major conformational rearrangement required for alternating access in this protein (9Reyes N. Ginter C. Boudker O. Transport mechanism of a bacterial homologue of glutamate transporters.Nature. 2009; 462: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). To determine whether cleaving 3L4 restricts GltPh's access to one key state, the IFS, we introduced cysteines at positions known to form cross-links only in that state (9Reyes N. Ginter C. Boudker O. Transport mechanism of a bacterial homologue of glutamate transporters.Nature. 2009; 462: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). If such cross-links form effectively after cleaving 3L4, GltPh must be able to sample the inward-facing conformation despite loop scission. Using a gel-based cross-linking assay, we monitored IFS formation in a purified, detergent-solubilized GltPh by introducing cysteines at positions 55 and 364 into a Cys-less background with a Factor X site at residue 125 (from now on referred to as GltPhXaC2, see Fig. 1A). Cysteines at these positions were first shown to form a disulfide bond during an electrophysiological characterization of EAAT1 (23Ryan R.M. Mitrovic A.D. Vandenberg R.J. The chloride permeation pathway of a glutamate transporter and its proximity to the glutamate translocation pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20742-20751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Subsequently, an x-ray structure of the cross-linked form of the equivalent GltPh mutant showed that cysteines in these positions are only in close proximity in the IFS (IFS Cα-Cα distance = 7.3 Å, OFS Cα-Cα distance = 27.6 Å) (9Reyes N. Ginter C. Boudker O. Transport mechanism of a bacterial homologue of glutamate transporters.Nature. 2009; 462: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Furthermore, stabilizing the IFS of GltPh by cross-linking residues 55 and 364 increases the protein's electrophoretic mobility, making it easily discernible from noncross-linked protein on a polyacrylamide gel (9Reyes N. Ginter C. Boudker O. Transport mechanism of a bacterial homologue of glutamate transporters.Nature. 2009; 462: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Here, cross-linking was performed in the absence of substrate, so the inward-facing state stabilized will be predominantly empty transporter (Fig. 1B, black box). Initial attempts to cross-link cleaved GltPhXaC2 with Hg2+ were complicated by extraneous reactions with the metal (see “Experimental Procedures”), so we developed an alternative approach based on the homobifunctional thiol-reactive reagent, MTS-1-MTS (linker length ∼5 Å). In the absence of Factor X treatment, the predominant protein band is a full-length and noncross-linked GltPhXaC2 (Fig. 1C, lane 1). A small population of cross-linked protein was also apparent, caused by oxidative disulfide formation during the 24-h incubation, a fact confirmed by the disappearance of this band after reduction with β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Treatment of GltPhXaC2 with Factor X produced two fragments (N- and C-terminal fragments) with no full-length protein remaining (Fig. 1C, lane 3). Minimal changes in electrophoretic migration of the two fragments upon reduction with β-ME indicate that the protein band positions are not caused by aberrant cross-linking events (Fig. 1C, lane 4). We observed small cross-link-independent differences in all protein band migration profiles in the presence of β-ME. Treating detergent-solubilized GltPhXaC2 with MTS-1-MTS alone led to increased electrophoretic mobility, indicative of IFS cross-link formation, and it was fully reversible with β-ME treatment (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 6). Cleaving GltPhXaC2 produces only N- and C-terminal fragments; however, if the fully cleaved protein is then treated with MTS-1-MTS, a third higher molecular weight protein band was also apparent, which is the product of cross-linking the N- and C-terminal fragments (Fig. 1C, lane 7). We confirmed that this band is formed by cross-linking between the proteolytic fragments because, upon reduction, we observed disappearance of the high molecular weight band and an intensification of the N- and C-terminal fragments (Fig. 1C, lane 8). Mutants containing the Factor X site and the single cysteine substitutions did not form this cross-linked band, indicating that both cysteines in the engineered cross-linking pair are required and that intermolecular cross-linking is not responsible (data not shown). This result demonstrates that, despite lacking an intact 3L4, GltPh is still able to sample the inward-facing conformation in detergent solution. In a related assay, where GltPhXaC2 is first locked into the IFS by treatment with MTS-1-MTS and then digested with Factor X, we observe full cleavage of 3L4, indicating that 3L4 is accessible to protease in the inward-facing conformation (data not shown). To complement this work, we also made several attempts to stabilize the OFS using engineered cysteines; K55C/G280C, V51C/T275C, L212C/V274C, V216C/A391C, Q220C/I389C, V58C/P283C, and L66C/S300C.

There is no related literature on the use of bosentan therapy for paraquat poisoning.To study the use of bosentan to treat acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis as induced by paraquat.A total of 120 adult Wister male rats were randomly assigned to three groups: the paraquat poisoning group (rats were intragastrically administered with paraquat at 50 mg/kg body weight once at the beginning); the bosentan therapy group (rats were administered bosentan at 100 mg/kg body weight by intragastric administration half an hour after paraquat was administered, then the same dose was administered once a day); and a control group (rats were administered intragastric physiological saline). On the 3rd, 7th, 14th, and 21st days following paraquat exposure, rats were sacrificed, and samples of lung tissue and venous blood were collected. The levels of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and hydroxyproline (HYP) in the plasma and lung homogenate were determined. Optical and electronic microscopes were used to examine pathological changes.The TGF-β1, ET-1, and HYP of the paraquat poisoning group were significantly higher than in the control group, and they were significantly lower in the 21st day therapy group than in the paraquat poisoning group on the same day. Under the optical and electronic microscopes, lung tissue damage was observed to be more severe but was then reduced after bosentan was administered.Bosentan can reduce inflammation factor release. It has a therapeutic effect on acute lung injury as induced by paraquat."
https://openalex.org/W2028063021,"A main challenge for structural biologists is to understand the mechanisms that discriminate between molecular interactions and determine function. Here, we show how partner recognition of the AXH domain of the transcriptional co-regulator ataxin-1 is fine-tuned by a subtle balance between self- and hetero-associations. Ataxin-1 is the protein responsible for the hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, a disease linked to protein aggregation and transcriptional dysregulation. Expansion of a polyglutamine tract is essential for ataxin-1 aggregation, but the sequence-wise distant AXH domain plays an important aggravating role in the process. The AXH domain is also a key element for non-aberrant function as it intervenes in interactions with multiple protein partners. Previous data have shown that AXH is dimeric in solution and forms a dimer of dimers when crystallized. By solving the structure of a complex of AXH with a peptide from the interacting transcriptional repressor CIC, we show that the dimer interface of AXH is displaced by the new interaction and that, when blocked by the CIC peptide AXH aggregation and misfolding are impaired. This is a unique example in which palindromic self- and hetero-interactions within a sequence with chameleon properties discriminate the partner. We propose a drug design strategy for the treatment of SCA1 that is based on the information gained from the AXH/CIC complex."

This was repeated with aperture diameters of 1.5 and 2.5 mm. Each day, monocular and binocular pattern-reversal Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP) were recorded. Additionally, the Pulfrich effect was measured: the task of the subject was to state whether a a 2-deg spot appeared in front or behind the plane of a central cross when moved left-to-right or right-to-left on a display screen. The retinal illuminance of the dominant eye was varied using neutral density (ND) filters to establish the ND value which eliminated the Pulfrich effect for each lens. All experiments were performed at luminance levels of 5 and 30 cd/m(2).Interocular differences in monocular VEP latency (at 30 cd/m(2)) rose to about 12-15 ms and 20-25 ms when the CL aperture was 2.5 and 1.5 mm, respectively. The effect was more pronounced at 5 cd/m(2) (i.e. with larger natural pupils). A strong Pulfrich effect was observed under all conditions, with the effect being less striking for the 2.5 mm aperture. No neural adaptation appeared to occur: neither the interocular differences in VEP latency nor the ND value required to null the Pulfrich effect reduced over each 7-day period of anisocoric vision.Small-aperture monovision produced marked interocular differences in visual latency and a Pulfrich experience. These were not reduced by adaptation, perhaps because the natural pupil diameter of the dominant eye was continually changing throughout the day due to varying illumination and other factors, making adaptation difficult."

To provide insight to the mechanisms linking hematologic malignancy to STAT5 activation/regulation of target genes, we identified STAT5 target genes and focused on Dpf3 gene, which encodes for an epigenetic factor. Dpf3 expression was induced upon IL-3 stimulation in Ba/F3 cells, while strong binding of both STAT5a and STAT5b was detected in its promoter. Reduced expression of Dpf3 was detected in Ba/F3 cells with Stat5a and Stat5b knock-down, suggesting that this gene is positively regulated by STAT5, upon IL-3 stimulation. Furthermore, this gene was significantly up-regulated in CLL patients, where DPF3 gene/protein up-regulation and strong STAT5 binding to the DPF3 promoter, correlated with increased STAT5 activation, mainly in non-malignant myeloid cells (granulocytes). Our findings provide insights in the STAT5 dependent transcriptional regulation of Dpf3, and demonstrate for the first time increased STAT5 activation in granulocytes of CLL patients. Novel routes of investigation are opened to facilitate the understanding of the role of STAT5 activation in the communication between non-malignant myeloid and malignant B-cells, and the functions of STAT5 target genes networks in CLL biology."
https://openalex.org/W1983131619,"Disease surveillance allows prospective monitoring of patterns in disease incidence in the general community, specific institutions (e.g. hospitals, elderly care homes), and other important population subgroups. Surveillance activities are now routinely conducted in many developed countries and in certain easy-to-reach areas of the developing ones. However due to limited health resources, population in rural area that consisted of the most the vulnerable groups are not under surveillance. Cheaper alternative ways for disease surveillance were needed in resource-limited settings.In this study, a syndromic surveillance system using disease specific absenteeism rates was established in 47 pre-schools with 1,417 students 3-6 y of age in a rural area of Kampot province, Cambodia. School absenteeism data were collected via short message service. Data collected between 1st January and 31st December 2012 was used for system evaluation for future potential use in larger scale. The system appeared to be feasible and acceptable in the rural study setting. Moderate correlation was found between rates of school absenteeism due to illness and the reference data on rates of attendance at health centers in persons <16 y (maximum cross-correlation coefficient = 0.231 at lag = -1 week).School absenteeism data is pre-existing, easily accessible and requires minimum time and resources after initial development, and our results suggest that this system may be able to provide complementary data for disease surveillance, especially in resource limited settings where there is very little information on illnesses in the community and traditional surveillance systems are difficult to implement. An important next step is to validate the syndromic data with other forms of surveillance including laboratory data."

To determine the functional relevance of D5 dopamine receptors, we created D5 dopamine receptor-deficient mice and then used these mice to assess the roles of D5 dopamine receptors in the behavioral response to methamphetamine. Interestingly, D5 dopamine receptor-deficient mice displayed increased ambulation in response to methamphetamine. Furthermore, dopamine transporter threonine phosphorylation levels, which regulate amphetamine-induced dopamine release, were elevated in D5 dopamine receptor-deficient mice. The increase in methamphetamine-induced locomotor activity was eliminated by pretreatment with the dopamine transporter blocker GBR12909. Taken together, these results suggest that dopamine transporter activity and threonine phosphorylation levels are regulated by D5 dopamine receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2107330109,"DNA damage induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation can be removed by nucleotide excision repair through two sub-pathways, one general (GGR) and the other specific for transcribed DNA (TCR), and the processing of unrepaired lesions trigger signals that may lead to cell death. These signals involve the tumor suppressor p53 protein, a central regulator of cell responses to DNA damage, and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2, that forms a feedback regulatory loop with p53. The involvement of cell cycle and transcription on the signaling to apoptosis was investigated in UVB-irradiated synchronized, DNA repair proficient, CS-B (TCR-deficient) and XP-C (GGR-deficient) primary human fibroblasts. Cells were irradiated in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, with two doses with equivalent levels of apoptosis (low and high), defined for each cell line. In the three cell lines, the low doses of UVB caused only a transient delay in progression to the S phase, whereas the high doses induced permanent cell cycle arrest. However, while accumulation of Mdm2 correlated well with the recovery from transcription inhibition at the low doses for normal and CS-B fibroblasts, for XP-C cells this protein was shown to be accumulated even at UVB doses that induced high levels of apoptosis. Thus, UVB-induced accumulation of Mdm2 is critical for counteracting p53 activation and apoptosis avoidance, but its effect is limited due to transcription inhibition. However, in the case of XP-C cells, an excess of unrepaired DNA damage would be sufficient to block S phase progression, which would signal to apoptosis, independent of Mdm2 accumulation. The data clearly discriminate DNA damage signals that lead to cell death, depending on the presence of UVB-induced DNA damage in replicating or transcribing regions."
https://openalex.org/W2031098113,"In response to pain, neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor availability is altered in the central nervous system. The NK1 receptor and its primary agonist, substance P, also play a crucial role in peripheral tissue in response to pain, as part of neurogenic inflammation. However, little is known about alterations in NK1 receptor availability in peripheral tissue in chronic pain conditions and very few studies have been performed on human beings. Ten subjects with chronic tennis elbow were therefore examined by positron emission tomography (PET) with the NK1 specific radioligand [11C]GR205171 before and after treatment with graded exercise. The radioligand signal intensity was higher in the affected arm as compared with the unaffected arm, measured as differences between the arms in volume of voxels and signal intensity of this volume above a reference threshold set as 2.5 SD above mean signal intensity of the unaffected arm before treatment. In the eight subjects examined after treatment, pain ratings decreased in all subjects but signal intensity decreased in five and increased in three. In conclusion, NK1 receptors may be activated, or up-regulated in the peripheral, painful tissue of a chronic pain condition. This up-regulation does, however, have moderate correlation to pain ratings. The increased NK1 receptor availability is interpreted as part of ongoing neurogenic inflammation and may have correlation to the pathogenesis of chronic tennis elbow.

https://openalex.org/W2033582794,"The identification of phenotype descriptions in the scientific literature, case reports and patient records is a rewarding task for bio-medical text mining. Any progress will support knowledge discovery and linkage to other resources. However because of their wide variation a number of challenges still remain in terms of their identification and semantic normalisation before they can be fully exploited for research purposes. This paper presents novel techniques for identifying potential complex phenotype mentions by exploiting a hybrid model based on machine learning, rules and dictionary matching. A systematic study is made of how to combine sequence labels from these modules as well as the merits of various ontological resources. We evaluated our approach on a subset of Medline abstracts cited by the Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man database related to auto-immune diseases. Using partial matching the best micro-averaged F-score for phenotypes and five other entity classes was 79.9%. A best performance of 75.3% was achieved for phenotype candidates using all semantics resources. We observed the advantage of using SVM-based learn-to-rank for sequence label combination over maximum entropy and a priority list approach. The results indicate that the identification of simple entity types such as chemicals and genes are robustly supported by single semantic resources, whereas phenotypes require combinations. Altogether we conclude that our approach coped well with the compositional structure of phenotypes in the auto-immune domain."
https://openalex.org/W2092743958,"Calcium signals play a major role in the control of all key stages of neuronal development, and in particular in the growth and orientation of neuritic processes. These signals are characterized by high spatial compartmentalization, a property which has a strong relevance in the different roles of specific neuronal regions in information coding. In this context it is therefore important to understand the structural and functional basis of this spatial compartmentalization, and in particular whether the behavior at each compartment is merely a consequence of its specific geometry or the result of the spatial segregation of specific calcium influx/efflux mechanisms. Here we have developed a novel approach to separate geometrical from functional differences, regardless on the assumptions on the actual mechanisms involved in the generation of calcium signals. First, spatial indices are derived with a wavelet-theoretic approach which define a measure of the oscillations of cytosolic calcium concentration in specific regions of interests (ROIs) along a cell, in our case developing chick ciliary ganglion neurons. The resulting spatial profile demonstrates clearly that different ROIs along the neuron are characterized by specific patterns of calcium oscillations. Next we have investigated whether this inhomogeneity is due just to geometrical factors, namely the surface to volume ratio in the different subcompartments (e.g. soma vs. growth cone) or it depends on their specific biophysical properties. To this aim correlation functions are computed between the activity indices and the surface/volume ratio along the cell: the data thus obtained are validated by a statistical analysis on a dataset of different cells. This analysis shows that whereas in the soma calcium dynamics is highly correlated to the surface/volume ratio, correlations drop in the growth cone-neurite region, suggesting that in this latter case the key factor is the expression of specific mechanisms controlling calcium influx/efflux."
https://openalex.org/W2040246237,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2) play a critical role in disease progression, relapse and therapeutic resistance of advanced prostate cancer (PCa). In this paper, we evaluated, for the first time, the therapeutic benefit of blocking EGRF and/or COX-2 (using gefitinib and NS-398, respectively) in terms of improving the efficacy of the conventional clinical chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel in vitro and vivo. We showed that EGFR and COX-2 expression was higher in metastatic than non-metastatic PCa tissues and cells. Docetaxel, alone or in combination with gefitinib or NS-398, resulted in a small decrease in cell viability. The three drug combination decreased cell viability to a greater extent than docetaxel alone or in combination with gefitinib or NS-398. Docetaxel resulted in a modest increase in apoptotic cell in metastatic and non-metastatic cell lines. NS-398 markedly enhanced docetaxel-induced cell apoptosis. The combination of the three drugs caused even more marked apoptosis and resulted in greater suppression of invasive potential than docetaxel alone or in association with gefitinib or NS-398. The combination of all three drugs also resulted in a more marked decrease in NF-ΚB, MMP-9 and VEGF levels in PC-3M cells. These in vitro findings were supported by in vivo studies showing that docetaxel in combination with gefitinib and NS-398 was significantly more effective than any individual agent. Based on previous preclinical research, we conclude that simultaneously blocking EGFR and COX-2 by gefitinib and NS-398 sensitizes advanced PCa cells to docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity."

We re-initiated a set of 3 cultures for analysis of the ""uncultivable"" or poorly-grown microbes using NGS technology. Broth of cultures from 3 blood samples, submitted from OHSU between 2000 and 2004, were inoculated into culture flasks containing fresh modified SP4 medium and kept at room temperature (RT), 30°C and 35°C. The cultures showing evidence of microbial growth were expanded and subjected to DNA analysis by genomic sequencing using Illumina MiSeq. Two of the 3 re-initiated blood cultures kept at RT after 7-8 weeks showed evidence of microbial growth that gradually reached into a cell density with detectable turbidity. The microbes in the broth when streaked on SP4 agar plates produced microscopic colonies in ∼ 2 weeks. Genomic studies revealed that the microbes isolated from the 2 blood cultures were a novel Afipia species, tentatively named Afipia septicemium. Microbes in the 3(rd) culture (OHSU_III) kept at RT had a limited level of growth and could not reach a plateau with high cell density. Genomic sequencing identified the microbe in the culture as a previously unknown species of Bradyrhizobium bacteria. This study reports on the isolation of novel Afipia and Bradyrhizobium species. Isolation of Bradyrhizobium species bacteria has never been reported in humans. The study also reveals a previously unrecognized nature of hematogenous infections by the 2 unique groups of Bradyrhizobiaceae. Our studies show that improvement of culture system plus effective use of NGS technology can facilitate findings of infections by unusual microbes in patients having poorly-defined, sometimes mysterious illnesses."
https://openalex.org/W1976153268,"Candida albicans, a dimorphic fungus, undergoes hyphal development in response to many different environmental cues, including growth in contact with a semi-solid matrix. C. albicans forms hyphae that invade agar when cells are embedded in or grown on the surface of agar, and the integral membrane protein Dfi1p is required for this activity. In addition, Dfi1p is required for full activation of mitogen activated protein kinase Cek1p during growth on agar. In this study, we identified a putative calmodulin binding motif in the C-terminal tail of Dfi1p. This region of Dfi1p bound to calmodulin in vitro, and mutations that affected this region affected both calmodulin binding in vitro and invasive filamentation when incorporated into the full length Dfi1p protein. Moreover, increasing intracellular calcium levels led to calcium-dependent, Dfi1p-dependent Cek1p activation. We propose that conformational changes in Dfi1p in response to environmental conditions encountered during growth allow the protein to bind calmodulin and initiate a signaling cascade that activates Cek1p."

GAT1 KO mice exhibited dominant theta-activity and a remarkable reduction of EEG power in low frequencies across all vigilance stages. Under baseline conditions, spontaneous rapid eye movement (REM) sleep of KO mice was elevated both during the light and dark periods, and non-REM (NREM) sleep was reduced during the light period only. KO mice also showed more state transitions from NREM to REM sleep and from REM sleep to wakefulness, as well as more number of REM and NREM sleep bouts than WT mice. During the dark period, KO mice exhibited more REM sleep bouts only. Six hours of sleep deprivation induced rebound increases in NREM and REM sleep in both genotypes. However, slow wave activity, the intensity component of NREM sleep was briefly elevated in WT mice but remained completely unchanged in KO mice, compared with their respective baselines. These results indicate that GAT1 plays a critical role in the regulation of REM sleep and homeostasis of NREM sleep."
https://openalex.org/W2116913657,"Objectives Caspofungin, currently used as salvage therapy for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), strangely only causes morphological changes in fungal growth in vitro but does not inhibit the growth. In vivo it has good efficacy. Therefore the question arises how this in vivo activity is reached. Caspofungin is known to increase the amount of chitin in the fungal cell wall. Mammals produce two chitinases, chitotriosidase and AMCase, which can hydrolyse chitin. We hypothesized that the mammalian chitinases play a role in the in vivo efficacy of caspofungin. Methods In order to determine the role of chitotriosidase and AMCase in IPA, both chitinases were measured in rats which did or did not receive caspofungin treatment. In order to understand the role of each chitinase in the breakdown of the caspofungin-exposed cells, we also exposed caspofungin treated fungi to recombinant enzymes in vitro. Results IPA in immunocompromised rats caused a dramatic increase in chitinase activity. This increase in chitinase activity was still noted when rats were treated with caspofungin. In vitro, it was demonstrated that the action of both chitinases were needed to lyse the fungal cell wall upon caspofungin exposure. Conclusion Caspofungin seemed to alter the cell wall in such a way that the two chitinases, when combined, could lyse the fungal cell wall and assisted in clearing the fungal pathogen. We also found that both chitinases combined had a direct effect on the fungus in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2070867563,"A considerable percentage of the genome is dedicated to the ubiquitin-proteasome system, with the yeast genome predicted to encode approximately 100 ubiquitin ligases (or E3s), and the human genome predicted to encode more than 600 E3s. The most abundant class of E3s consists of RING finger-containing proteins. Although many insights have been obtained regarding the structure and catalytic mechanism of the E3s, much remains to be learned about the function of the individual E3s. Here we characterize IRC20, which encodes a dual RING- and Snf/Swi family ATPase domain-containing protein in yeast that has been implicated in DNA repair. We found that overexpression of IRC20 causes two transcription-associated phenotypes and demonstrate that the Irc20 RING domain possesses ubiquitin E3 activity in vitro. Two mass spectrometry approaches were undertaken to identify Irc20-associated proteins. Wild-type Irc20 associated with Cdc48, a AAA-ATPase that serves as an intermediary in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. A second approach using a RING mutant derivative of Irc20 detected increased association of the Irc20 mutant with SUMO. These findings provide a foundation for understanding the roles of Irc20 in transcription and DNA repair."

Though many facts are known regarding its structural and functional aspects, much still can be learnt from natural variants of the wild type protein. This work aims at investigating the nature of functional inertness of a HapR natural variant harboring a substitution of a conserved glutamate residue at position 117 which participates in forming a salt bridge by lysine (HapRV2G-E117K). Experimental evidence presented here reveals the inability of this variant to interact with various cognate promoters by in vitro gel shift assay. Furthermore, the elution profiles of HapRV2G-E117K protein along with the wild type functional HapRV2G in size-exclusion chromatography as well as circular dichroism spectra did not reflect any significant differences in its structure, thereby indicating the intactness of dimer in the variant protein. To gain further insight into the global shape of the proteins, small angle X-ray scattering analysis (SAXS) was performed. Intriguingly, increased radius of gyration of HapRV2G-E117K of 27.5 Å in comparison to the wild type protein from SAXS data analyses implied a significant alteration in the global shape of the dimeric HapRV2G-E117K protein. Structure reconstruction brought forth that the DNA binding domains were substantially “parted away” in this variant. Taken together, our data illustrates that substitution of the conserved glutamate residue by lysine in the dimerization domain induces separation of the two DNA binding domains from their native-like positioning without altering the dimeric status of HapR variant."
https://openalex.org/W2023451020,"Dap12 and FcRγ, the two transmembrane ITAM-containing signaling adaptors expressed in dendritic cells (DC), are implicated in the regulation of DC function. Several activating and adhesion receptors including integrins require these chains for their function in triggering downstream signaling and effector pathways, however the exact role(s) for Dap12 and FcRγ remains elusive as their loss can lead to both attenuating and enhancing effects. Here, we report that mice congenitally lacking both Dap12 and FcRγ chains (DF) show a massively enhanced effector CD8(+) T cell response to protein antigen immunization or West Nile Virus (WNV) infection. Thus, immunization of DF mice with MHCI-restricted OVA peptide leads to accumulation of IL-12-producing monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DC) in draining lymph nodes, followed by vastly enhanced generation of antigen-specific IFNγ-producing CD8(+) T cells. Moreover, DF mice show increased viral clearance in the WNV infection model. Depletion of CCR2+ monocytes/macrophages in vivo by administration anti-CCR2 antibodies or clodronate liposomes completely prevents the exaggerated CD8+ T cell response in DF mice. Mechanistically, we show that the loss of Dap12 and FcRγ-mediated signals in Mo-DC leads to a disruption of GM-CSF receptor-induced STAT5 activation resulting in upregulation of expression of IRF8, a transcription factor. Consequently, Dap12- and FcRγ-deficiency exacerbates GM-CSF-driven monocyte differentiation and production of inflammatory Mo-DC. Our data suggest a novel cross-talk between DC-ITAM and GM-CSF signaling pathways, which controls Mo-DC differentiation, IL-12 production, and CD8(+) T cell responses."
https://openalex.org/W2025703050,"This paper presents the development of the Complementary Feeding Utility Index (CFUI), a composite index aimed to measure adherence to infant feeding guidelines. Through an axiomatic characterization this paper shows the advantages in using the CFUI are the following: it avoids the use of arbitrary cut-offs, and by converting observed diet preferences into utilities, summing the score is meaningful. In addition, as the CFUI is designed to be scored continuously, it allows the transition from intake of beneficial foods (in low quantities) and intake of detrimental foods (in high quantities) to be more subtle. The paper first describes the rationale being the development of the CFUI and then elaborates on the methodology used to develop the CFUI, including the process of selecting the components. The methodology is applied to data collected from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children to show the advantages of the CFUI over traditional diet index approaches. Unlike traditional approaches, the distribution of the CFUI does not peak towards mean value but distributes evenly towards the tails of the distribution."
