Multiple linear regression (y = bx1 + bx2 . . .) gives better ""goodness of fit"" than curvilinear analysis (y = bxz). The variation in number of species on large islands can be predicted more accurately than the variation on small ones. Ecologic diversity and isolation are the natural regulators of species abundance."

https://openalex.org/W2092904965,There were about six solar flare events during the last solar cycle which would have exposed a space traveler to serious radiation from solar particles. The radiation from two of these events was intense enough to necessitate extra precautions being taken to protect space travelers.
https://openalex.org/W2040026067,"The solar absorptance and hemispherical emittance of meteoritic iron has been measured from -100 degrees to 300 degrees C for a surface characterized by a 400-grit finish. If it is assumed that 10 percent of the surface is optically black because of holes and cracks, the temperature of an iron meteoroid at the earth's mean distance from the sun would be about 90 degrees C."

https://openalex.org/W1964878758,Tellurium in amounts ranging from 5 to 125 parts per million was present in all of 12 samples of manganese oxide nodules from the floor of the Pacific and Indian oceans. These samples represent the first recognized points of high tellurium concentration in a sedimentary cycle. The analyses may lend support to the theory that the minor-element content of sea-floor manganese nodules is derived from volcanic emanations.
