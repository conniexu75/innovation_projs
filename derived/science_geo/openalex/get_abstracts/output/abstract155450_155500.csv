https://openalex.org/W2039569931,We have isolated the “complete” repertoire of genes encoding the odorant receptors in Drosophila and employ these genes to provide a molecular description of the organization of the peripheral olfactory system. The repertoire of Drosophila odorant receptors is encoded by 57 genes. Individual sensory neurons are likely to express only a single receptor gene. Neurons expressing a given gene project axons to one or two spatially invariant glomeruli in the antennal lobe. The insect brain therefore retains a two-dimensional map of receptor activation such that the quality of an odor may be encoded by different spatial patterns of activity in the antennal lobe.

Using a combination of affinity- and conventional chromatographic techniques, we have isolated a predominant form of a multiprotein BRCA1-containing complex from human cells displaying chromatin-remodeling activity. Mass spectrometric sequencing of components of this complex indicated that BRCA1 is associated with a SWI/SNF-related complex. We show that BRCA1 can directly interact with the BRG1 subunit of the SWI/SNF complex. Moreover, p53-mediated stimulation of transcription by BRCA1 was completely abrogated by either a dominant-negative mutant of BRG1 or the cancer-causing deletion in exon 11 of BRCA1. These findings reveal a direct function for BRCA1 in transcriptional control through modulation of chromatin structure."
https://openalex.org/W2011745548,"Angiogenesis is an important event for embryonic organogenesis as well as for tissue repair in the adult. Here, we show that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) play important roles for angiogenesis during embryogenesis. To investigate the role of HSCs in endothelial cell (EC) development, we analyzed AML1-deficient embryos, which lack definitive hematopoiesis. These embryos showed defective angiogenesis in the head and pericardium. Para-aortic splanchnopleural (P-Sp) explant cultures on stromal cells (P-Sp culture) did not generate definitive hematopoietic cells and showed defective angiogenesis in the AML1 null embryo. Disrupted angiogenesis in P-Sp cultures from AML1 null embryos was rescued by addition of HSCs or angiopoietin-1 (Ang1). HSCs, which express Ang1, directly promoted migration of ECs in vivo and in vitro. These results indicate that HSCs are critical for angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2054290614,"Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), one of the most abundant chaperones in eukaryotes, participates in folding and stabilization of signal-transducing molecules including steroid hormone receptors and protein kinases. The amino terminus of Hsp90 contains a non-conventional nucleotide-binding site, related to the ATP-binding motif of bacterial DNA gyrase. The anti-tumor agents geldanamycin and radicicol bind specifically at this site and induce destabilization of Hsp90-dependent client proteins. We recently demonstrated that the gyrase inhibitor novobiocin also interacts with Hsp90, altering the affinity of the chaperone for geldanamycin and radicicol and causing in vitro and in vivo depletion of key regulatory Hsp90-dependent kinases including v-Src, Raf-1, and p185ErbB2. In the present study we used deletion/mutation analysis to identify the site of interaction of novobiocin with Hsp90, and we demonstrate that the novobiocin-binding site resides in the carboxyl terminus of the chaperone. Surprisingly, this motif also recognizes ATP, and ATP and novobiocin efficiently compete with each other for binding to this region of Hsp90. Novobiocin interferes with association of the co-chaperones Hsc70 and p23 with Hsp90. These results identify a second site on Hsp90 where the binding of small molecule inhibitors can significantly impact the function of this chaperone, and they support the hypothesis that both amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of Hsp90 interact to modulate chaperone activity.

In contrast to the amino terminus, the crystal structure of the carboxyl-terminal region of Hsp90 remains undetermined, and biochemical characterization of this portion of the chaperone suggests that a complex interaction between this and the amino-terminal domain is a critical regulatory component of chaperone function (14Scheibel T.

We recently reported that novobiocin, an antibiotic previously shown to bind adjacent to the ATP-binding site of bacterial gyrase B and to interfere with nucleotide binding (24Maxwell A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), was also able to interact with Hsp90, albeit with lower affinity than with gyrase B, and to disrupt the chaperone activity of Hsp90 in a manner similar to GA and radicicol (25Marcu M.G. Schulte T.W. Neckers L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Thus, cells exposed to novobiocin demonstrated rapid destabilization of various Hsp90 client proteins, including Raf-1, mutated p53, p60v-Src, and p185ErbB2. Unexpectedly, however, although novobiocin antagonized Hsp90 binding to both GA and radicicol, the Hsp90-binding domain of novobiocin appeared to be distinct from the amino-terminal GA/radicicol/nucleotide-binding domain (25Marcu M.G. Schulte T.W. Neckers L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have localized the Hsp90-binding site of novobiocin to a region overlapping the carboxyl-terminal dimerization domain of the chaperone. The current data, together with our previous study (25Marcu M.G. Schulte T.W. Neckers L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), emphasize the functional significance of novobiocin binding to Hsp90, support the possibility that the conformation of Hsp90's amino terminus can influence the behavior of the carboxyl-terminal portion of the molecule, and suggest that a previously unrecognized second nucleotide-binding domain exists in the carboxyl terminus of Hsp90. Full-length chicken Hsp90β cDNA (amino acids 1–728), full-length Hsp90 containing various amino-terminal point mutations, and the Δ221–728 (Δ1), Δ303–728 (Δ2), Δ380–728 (Δ3), Δ3 lacking amino acids 657–677 (Δ3Δ), and Δ538–728 (Δ4) carboxyl-terminal chicken Hsp90 truncation fragments, subcloned in pGEM-7Z (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), were gifts of Dr. David Toft (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN), and their preparation was described previously (26Sullivan W.P. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20373-20379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type and mutated (K111A, G182D) amino-terminal (amino acids 1–222) fragments of chicken Hsp90 were obtained from wild type or the corresponding previously mutated full-length chicken Hsp90 cDNA by polymerase chain reaction using primers designed to contain BamHI (for 5′) andEcoRI (for 3′) restriction sites, and the DNA fragments were then subcloned in pBluescript II SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Truncation mutants Δ380–539 (Δ3-Δ4), Δ3, and Δ4 lacking amino acids 657–677 (Δ3Δ and Δ4Δ, respectively) were obtained by polymerase chain reaction and cloned in pBluescript II SK as above. The purified fusion proteins GST-Wt Hsp90 (amino acids 1–728), GST-C1 (Hsp90 amino acids 1–332), and GST-C3 (Hsp90 amino acids 446–728) were kind gifts of David Toft and Maria-Grazia Catelli (Mayo Clinic and CNRS, Paris, France, respectively). Recombinant proteins were expressed from 1 μg of plasmids by in vitrotranscription/translation using the TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega Corp.) in the presence of translation grade [35S]methionine (1458 Ci/mmol, ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), with the appropriate DNA polymerase and following the manufacturer's instructions. Aliquots of each reaction (1 μl) were checked for translation efficiency, and 10–20 μl were diluted in the appropriate buffer and incubated with either novobiocin-Sepharose or ATP-Sepharose as described below. Novobiocin-Sepharose was prepared as described previously (25Marcu M.G. Schulte T.W. Neckers L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 27Staudenbauer W.L. Orr E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3589-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). 10–20 μl of in vitrotranslate or 4 μg of purified GST-Hsp90 proteins were diluted in 300 μl of buffer B (25 mm Hepes, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 10% ethylene glycol, 200 mm KCl) and incubated with novobiocin-Sepharose (100 μl), with or without preincubation (60 min at 4 °C) with various drugs, peptides, or ATP. Incubations were carried out with tumbling for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then thoroughly washed with cold buffer B containing 0.6 m KCl, boiled for 5 min in reducing Laemli loading buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with appropriate antibodies or by autoradiography of dried gels. γ-Phosphate-linked ATP-Sepharose (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was equilibrated in molybdate buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmNa2MoO4, 0.2% Tween 20, pH 7.5). Aliquots ofin vitro translates (10–20 μl) or 4 μg of purified GST-Hsp90 proteins were diluted in 300 μl of molybdate buffer and mixed, while tumbling, with ATP-Sepharose (100 μl) for 2 h at 4 °C. Samples were washed 3–4 times with cold molybdate buffer, and bound proteins were eluted and analyzed as described above. To study nucleotide competition of binding to ATP-Sepharose, we incubated 4 μg of purified GST-C3 with increasing concentrations of the sodium salts of ADP, ATP, CTP, and GTP (all from Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotary shaker prior to assessment of ATP-Sepharose binding. For investigation of the influence of novobiocin on Hsp90 association with the co-chaperones Hsc70 and p23, 1 mm novobiocin was added to reticulocyte lysate. After 30 min on ice, samples (25 μl) were diluted in 400 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Tween 20, 10 mmNa2MoO4, pH 7.5, and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of an Hsp90 antibody (SPA-771, Stressgen) specific for the Hsp90 amino terminus. Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to all samples, which were then rotated for an additional 2 h. Sepharose beads were washed 3–4 times with dilution buffer and processed for SDS-PAGE as described above. Hsp90 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies specific for either Hsc70 or p23. Hsp90 antibodies recognizing epitopes in either the amino terminus (amino acids 2–12; SPA-771) or carboxyl terminus (amino acids 604–697; SPA-830), as well as the Hsc70 antibody SPA-822 were purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Monoclonal antibody to p23 and Hsp90 antibody H9010 were gifts from Dr. David Toft (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Selected peptides were synthesized by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) using solid phase peptide synthesis. Both wild type and mismatched sequences were checked by Edman chemistry in a peptide sequencer, and peptide purity was determined by mass spectroscopy. All peptides were soluble in water. Immunoprecipitates or 10–20 μl of translation lysate were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting, and blocked for 2 h with a solution containing 5% nonfat dry milk, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20. The membranes were probed with indicated primary antibodies, followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and signals were detected using chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). Several amino-terminal point mutations known to abrogate GA and radicicol binding to Hsp90 were tested for their ability to affect binding to immobilized novobiocin. Previous analysis demonstrated that the mutants D92A, G94D, G113D, G131/4/6V, and G182D each displayed markedly impaired GA and radicicol binding (16Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P.

In contrast, with the exception of G113D, these mutants bound to novobiocin-Sepharose as well as or better than did wild type Hsp90 (Fig. 1 A). Additionally, the amino-terminal Hsp90 fragment containing the GA/radicicol-binding site (amino acids 1–222) failed to bind to immobilized novobiocin (Fig.1 B, and (25Marcu M.G. Schulte T.W. Neckers L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar)). Although the strongest binding to immobilized novobiocin was observed with the full-length point mutants K111A and G182D, the same mutations when made in the amino-terminal fragment of Hsp90 did not result in binding of this region to novobiocin (Fig.1 B). Because the amino terminus of Hsp90 did not bind novobiocin, we analyzed several carboxyl-terminal truncation fragments for binding to novobiocin-Sepharose (Fig. 2 and Fig.3). Although the longest carboxyl-terminal fragment, containing amino acids 221–728 (Δ1), failed to bind novobiocin, removal of the charged domain between residues 221 and 303 (Δ2) restored binding (Fig. 3 A). Analysis of successive truncations revealed that binding to novobiocin resided in a carboxyl-terminal Hsp90 fragment containing amino acids 538–728 (Δ4) (see Figs. 2 and 3 C). Deletion of amino acids 657–677 from both Δ3 (Δ3Δ) and Δ4 (Δ4Δ) significantly reduced binding to novobiocin-Sepharose (Fig.3 C). Surprisingly, binding of both the full-length point mutant G182D and the carboxyl-terminal Hsp90 truncations Δ2, Δ3, and Δ4 to immobilized novobiocin was effectively competed by both excess soluble novobiocin and ATP (Fig. 3 and Fig.4, A and B). Finally, increasing concentrations of soluble novobiocin were able to inhibit competitively the binding of Δ3 to novobiocin-Sepharose (Fig.3 D).Figure 2Map of the chicken Hsp90 constructs employed in the novobiocin and ATP binding studies, and their relative binding efficiency to novobiocin-Sepharose.

A, [35S]methionine-labeled chicken Hsp90 carboxyl-terminal fragments translated in reticulocyte lysate were incubated with or without novobiocin (5 mm) or sodium-ATP (10–15 mm) for 1 h at 4 °C. Equal amounts of ATP beads were added, and the tubes were further incubated, washed, and analyzed by autoradiography as described under “Materials and Methods.” B, Δ4 was labeled and translated in vitro as described above, and equal aliquots of protein were incubated for 1 h with increasing (5–500 μm) concentrations of sodium ATP.

The fraction of bound Δ4 was plotted as a function of ATP concentration after setting the value obtained from samples incubated without ATP to 1.0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since novobiocin competitively inhibits ATP binding to gyrase B, and because ATP inhibited Hsp90 binding to novobiocin-Sepharose, we tested whether the several carboxyl-terminal Hsp90 truncations that demonstrated novobiocin binding also bound to immobilized ATP in a manner competable by novobiocin. Δ1 did not bind to ATP-Sepharose, as predicted from its failure to bind to novobiocin, but Δ2, Δ3, and Δ4 did bind to immobilized ATP (Fig.4 A). Also predicted from its failure to bind to novobiocin, Δ3Δ did not bind to ATP-Sepharose. Finally, soluble ATP and novobiocin both competitively inhibited Hsp90 carboxyl-terminal fragment binding to ATP-Sepharose (Fig. 4, B andC, and data not shown). Because deletion of amino acids 657–677 markedly reduced the binding of Δ3 and Δ4 to immobilized novobiocin, we synthesized a peptide encompassing this sequence in order to determine if this region alone were sufficient to bind to novobiocin-Sepharose. A peptide of sequence YETALLSSGFSLED, corresponding to amino acids 663–676 of Hsp90, was able to inhibit novobiocin binding to Δ3, Δ4, and the full-length G182D point mutant (Fig. 5). In contrast, a mismatched peptide, of sequence YTEFLSASLEGLSD, had minimal effect even at the highest concentrations used (Fig. 5). In order to exclude spurious results due to possible dimerization between the various in vitrotranslated chicken Hsp90 constructs used in this study and the endogenous Hsp90 present in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (since such heterodimerization could produce binding artifacts mediated by rabbit Hsp90), we repeated several experiments using purified GST-Hsp90 proteins. First, we demonstrated that GST-C3 (a carboxyl-terminal Hsp90 fusion protein) bound to ATP-Sepharose and that binding was competed by excess ATP (Fig. 6 A). As expected, GST-C1 (an amino-terminal Hsp90 fusion protein) also bound to ATP-Sepharose. However, GST-C3 binding to ATP-Sepharose was specifically competed by the peptide derived from amino acids 663–676 of Hsp90, whereas GST-C1 binding was not (Fig. 6 B). Next, we demonstrated that GST-Wt Hsp90 and GST-C3, but not GST-C1, bound to novobiocin-Sepharose in a manner competable by excess novobiocin (Fig.6 C). GST-C3 binding to immobilized novobiocin was also specifically competed by the soluble peptide derived from the Hsp90 carboxyl terminus (Fig. 6 D). Finally, we examined the efficiency of competition of soluble ADP, ATP, CTP, and GTP with ATP-Sepharose binding of GST-C3 (Fig. 6 E). The order of efficiency was found to be ATP > ADP > GTP > CTP. These results are in contrast to the nucleotide affinity of the amino-terminal domain, which shows a distinct preference for ADP over ATP (16Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J.

One complex contains Hsc70, whose binding site overlaps the carboxyl-terminal dimerization domain identified in this study to contain the novobiocin-binding site (28Carrello A. Ingley E. Minchin R.F.

An alternative Hsp90 multichaperone complex contains an acidic protein, termed p23, that binds to Hsp90 in an ATP-dependent fashion (30Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The binding site of p23 is not fully characterized, but it is not confined to the isolated amino terminus (amino acids 1–221), although mutations in this region certainly affect p23 binding to full-length Hsp90 (16Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Clark J. Mimnaugh E. Krutzsch H. Ochel H.-J. Schulte T.W. Sausville E. Neckers L.M. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23843-23850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Residues in both amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal portions of Hsp90 were found necessary for binding of SBA1, a yeast homolog of p23 (31Fang Y. Fliss A.E. Rao J. Caplan A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3727-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Because novobiocin binds to a unique site on Hsp90, we wished to determine whether the drug might disrupt both Hsc70- and p23-containing multichaperone complexes. To perform this experiment, we made use of the fact that rabbit reticulocyte lysate contains copious amounts of both Hsp90-containing multichaperone complexes. We added novobiocin (1 mm) to reticulocyte lysate for 30 min on ice, and then we immunoprecipitated Hsp90 using an amino-terminally directed antibody (SPA-771). Following SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer, resultant blots were probed for p23 and Hsc70. Whereas p23 and Hsc70 were both readily co-immunoprecipitated with Hsp90 from untreated reticulocyte lysate, novobiocin preincubation caused a marked decrease in the amounts of both p23 and Hsc70 co-precipitated with Hsp90 (Fig.7). Novobiocin, a coumarin-type antibiotic, antagonizes Hsp90 functionin vitro and in vivo in a manner similar to GA and radicicol, two structurally different small molecules that both bind to an amino-terminal nucleotide-binding pocket on the chaperone (15Prodromou C.

Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). However, this study demonstrates that the structural requirements for novobiocin binding to Hsp90 are unique. First, several point mutations in the amino terminus of the chaperone that abrogate both GA and radicicol binding either did not affect or actually augmented novobiocin binding. Second, an amino-terminal fragment comprising the GA/radicicol-binding domain failed to bind to immobilized novobiocin. In contrast, analysis of progressively smaller carboxyl-terminal Hsp90 peptides revealed the novobiocin-binding site to be contained within amino acids 538–728. Within this region, the removal of amino acids 657–677 severely compromised novobiocin binding, and a synthetic peptide composed of amino acids 663–676 efficiently competed the binding of Hsp90 to immobilized novobiocin. Thus, these data localize the novobiocin-binding site to a region in Hsp90 known to be important both for its dimerization and for association of other co-chaperones. It has been proposed by several investigators that Hsp90 contains two distinct chaperone sites (14Scheibel T. Weikl T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 22Jibard N. Meng X. Leclerc P. Rajkowski K. Fortin D. Schweizer-Groyer G. Catelli M.-G. Baulieu E.-E. Cadepond F. Exp.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), one in the amino terminus and one in the carboxyl terminus of the protein, and that these sites are linked by a charged domain whose function may be to modulate the interaction of both chaperone domains (23Scheibel T. Siegmund H.I. Jaenicke R. Ganz P. Lilie H. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although possible effects of the charged domain on the chaperone activity/conformation of the carboxyl terminus are not known, our data suggest that the presence of the charged domain in the absence of the amino terminus clearly inhibits novobiocin binding to the carboxyl terminus. It is not certain if both chaperone domains operate independently of each other, but ATP (or GA) occupancy of the amino-terminal nucleotide-binding site certainly affects the binding of co-chaperones to the carboxyl terminus, whereas the binding of specific co-chaperone proteins to the carboxyl terminus negatively impacts the ability of the amino terminus to bind nucleotide or GA (16Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Clark J. Mimnaugh E. Krutzsch H. Ochel H.-J. Schulte T.W. Sausville E. Neckers L.M. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Our current data support the existence of cross-talk between the amino and carboxyl ends of Hsp90, since point mutations that disrupt ATP/GA binding to the amino terminus markedly enhanced novobiocin binding to the carboxyl terminus. Additionally, novobiocin binding to the carboxyl terminus of Hsp90 antagonizes the binding of GA and radicicol to the amino terminus (25Marcu M.G. Schulte T.W. Neckers L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). By further supporting functional interaction between amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of Hsp90, Hartson et al. (21Hartson S.D. Thulasiraman V. Huang W. Whitesell L. Matts R.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3837-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have shown that molybdate ion interacts with the carboxyl terminus of the chaperone in a region that, in light of our results, overlaps the novobiocin-binding site and that such interaction influences the conformation of the amino terminus. Prior association of GA with Hsp90 prevented the chaperone from attaining the molybdate-favored conformation (21Hartson S.D. Thulasiraman V. Huang W. Whitesell L. Matts R.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3837-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Taken together these data support a model in which the conformational state of either end of Hsp90 may affect the conformation/function of the opposite end, with the middle charged domain perhaps mediating such interactions. Surprisingly, binding of carboxyl-terminal Hsp90 fragments to novobiocin-Sepharose was competed not only by excess novobiocin but also by ATP. Additionally, the smallest carboxyl-terminal Hsp90 fragment, Δ4, that bound to immobilized novobiocin also bound to ATP-Sepharose, and this binding was competed by both novobiocin and ATP. Similar to its effects on novobiocin binding, deletion of amino acids 657–677 from either Δ3 or Δ4 carboxyl-terminal Hsp90 fragments reduced binding to ATP-Sepharose by greater than 90%, whereas the synthetic peptide duplicating the amino acid sequence from residues 663 to 676 effectively blocked Hsp90 binding to immobilized ATP. Binding of Δ4 to ATP-Sepharose was competitively inhibited by both soluble ATP and novobiocin, suggesting that the novobiocin-binding domain which we have mapped to the carboxyl terminus of Hsp90 may overlap a second nucleotide-binding site on the chaperone. An Hsp90 fragment lacking the amino-terminal 222 amino acids but containing the charged domain failed to bind ATP-Sepharose just as it failed to bind to novobiocin-Sepharose, suggesting that the charged domain may regulate nucleotide access to the carboxyl-terminal site. In support of this hypothesis, removal of the charged domain restored ATP binding to carboxyl-terminal Hsp90 peptides. Although we found no evidence that our results with in vitrotranslated Hsp90 carboxyl-terminal fragments were due to interference by rabbit Hsp90 present in the reticulocyte lysate (data not shown), we confirmed our findings using purified GST-Hsp90 fusion proteins. Thus a carboxyl-terminal GST-Hsp90 fusion protein (GST-C3) behaved exactly as the in vitro translated Δ4 carboxyl-terminal fragment, not only with respect to binding to novobiocin- and ATP-Sepharose, but also with respect to the ability of the soluble peptide to compete such binding. Analysis of the efficiency of various nucleotides as competitors of GST-C3 binding to ATP-Sepharose revealed that ATP was more efficient than ADP in this regard. In contrast, previous data demonstrated that the amino-terminal nucleotide-binding site has a 10-fold greater affinity for ADP as compared with ATP (16Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Clark J. Mimnaugh E. Krutzsch H. Ochel H.-J. Schulte T.W. Sausville E. Neckers L.M. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23843-23850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The fact that GTP was only minimally able and CTP completely unable to reduce the binding of GST-C3 to ATP-Sepharose lends further support to the specificity of our data. Although controversial, a precedent exists for a second ATP-binding site in the carboxyl terminus of Hsp90, analogous to the two nucleotide-binding sites found in the Hsp110 chaperone family (34Wawrzynow A. Banecki B. Zylicz M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Indeed, an early study by Csermely and Kahn (35Csermely P. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4943-4950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified the presence of an ATP-binding consensus sequence in the carboxyl-terminal half of Hsp90. Although the recent identification and extensive characterization of the amino-terminal nucleotide-binding site, together with the reported lack of ATP dependence of the chaperone activity mediated by the Hsp90 carboxyl terminus, have focused attention away from possible nucleotide interactions with other portions of this chaperone, careful kinetic analysis of ATP-dependent Hsp90 activities suggests the cooperativity of two nucleotide-binding sites (36Soti C. Radics L. Yahara I. Csermely P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Whether these sites represent two amino-terminal binding domains of an Hsp90 dimer, or perhaps one carboxyl- and one amino-terminal domain, remains to be determined. The physiologic significance of novobiocin binding to the Hsp90 carboxyl terminus is amply demonstrated by the ability of this antibiotic to destabilize and deplete a series of Hsp90 client proteins, similar to the effects of both GA and radicicol (25Marcu M.G. Schulte T.W. Neckers L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Further evidence of the biologic importance of novobiocin binding to Hsp90 is supplied by the data in this study showing that the drug interferes with both Hsc70 and p23 association. Since Hsc70 and p23 are components of two distinct multichaperone complexes formed around Hsp90, these results suggest that novobiocin binding disrupts both Hsp90-Hsc70-p60Hop and Hsp90-p50 (or immunophilin)-p23 complexes. This is in contrast to the effects of GA and radicicol that disrupt only p23-containing Hsp90 complexes (1Smith D.F. Whitesell L. Nair S.C. Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6804-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 20Schulte T.W. Akinaga S. Murakata T. Agatsuma T. Sugimoto S. Nakano H. Lee Y.S. Simen B.B. Argon Y. Felts S. Toft D.O.

Thus, novobiocin, besides mimicking the biologic effects of GA and radicicol, may have an additional negative impact on Hsp90 function not seen with the other drugs, although this hypothesis remains to be examined.

Complete loss of KIF3A caused large accumulations of opsin, arrestin, and membranes within the photoreceptor inner segment, while the localization of alpha-transducin was unaffected. Other membrane, organelle, and transport markers, as well as opsin processing appeared normal. Loss of KIF3A ultimately caused apoptotic photoreceptor cell death similar to a known opsin transport mutant. The data suggest that kinesin-II is required to transport opsin and arrestin from the inner to the outer segment and that blocks in this transport pathway lead to photoreceptor cell death as found in retinitis pigmentosa."

A role for p38α in mouse development and physiology was investigated by targeted disruption of the p38α locus. Whereas some p38α−/− embryos die between embryonic days 11.5 and 12.5, those that develop past this stage have normal morphology but are anemic owing to failed definitive erythropoiesis, caused by diminished erythropoietin (Epo) gene expression. As p38α-deficient hematopoietic stem cells reconstitute lethally irradiated hosts, p38α function is not required downstream of Epo receptor. Inhibition of p38 activity also interferes with stabilization of Epo mRNA in human hepatoma cells undergoing hypoxic stress. The p38α MAP kinase plays a critical role linking developmental and stress-induced erythropoiesis through regulation of Epo expression."

Similarly, EGFR-deficient fibroblasts are resistant to transformation by SOS-F and rasV12, however, tumorigenicity is restored by expression of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 gene. The K5-SOS-F papillomas and primary keratinocytesfrom wa2 mice display increased apoptosis, reduced Akt phosphorylation and grafting experiments imply a cell-autonomous requirement for EGFR in keratinocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2055869439,"In budding yeast, absence of the meiosis-specific Zip3 protein (also known as Cst9) causes synaptonemal complex formation to be delayed and incomplete. The Zip3 protein colocalizes with Zip2 at discrete foci on meiotic chromosomes, corresponding to the sites where synapsis initiates. Observations suggest that Zip3 promotes synapsis by recruiting the Zip2 protein to chromosomes and/or stabilizing the association of Zip2 with chromosomes. Zip3 interacts with a number of gene products involved in meiotic recombination, including proteins that act at both early (Mre11, Rad51, and Rad57) and late (Msh4 and Msh5) steps in the exchange process. We speculate that Zip3 is a component of recombination nodules and serves to link the initiation of synapsis to meiotic recombination."

We show that two LIM homeodomain transcription factors, Lim1 and Lmx1b, control the initial trajectory of motor axons in the developing mammalian limb. The expression of Lim1 by a lateral set of lateral motor column (LMC) neurons ensures that their axons select a dorsal trajectory in the limb. In a complementary manner, the expression of Lmx1b by dorsal limb mesenchymal cells controls the dorsal and ventral axonal trajectories of medial and lateral LMC neurons. In the absence of these two proteins, motor axons appear to select dorsal and ventral trajectories at random. Thus, LIM homeodomain proteins act within motor neurons and cells that guide motor axons to establish the fidelity of a binary choice in axonal trajectory."

Together with the TRAM protein, Sec61p provides a site in the membrane, at the interface of channel and lipid, through which a TM domain can dynamically equilibrate between the lipid and aqueous phases, depending on the hydrophobicity of the TM domain and the length of the polypeptide segment tethering it to the ribosome.

In addition to kinase activity, SH3 domains of Pak1 have been implicated in cytoskeletal changes and Pak1 localization, probably via their interaction with adapter molecules such as Nck, guanine nucleotide factor PIX, and paxillin (18Frost J.A.

Expression of the kinase-dead K299R Pak1 mutant blocks the transformation of Rat1 fibroblast by Ras (24Tang Y. Chen Z. Ambrose D. Liu J. Gibbs J.B. Chernoff J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4454-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and cooperative extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase activation by Ras, Rho, and Rac1 GTPases, suggesting that Pak1 plays a role in the cell transformation and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase activation (25Tang Y., Yu, J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Treatment of noninvasive human breast epithelial MCF-7 cells with HRG induces Pak1 kinase activity and motility (4Vadlamudi R. Adam L. Tseng B. Costa L. Kumar R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2843-2846PubMed Google Scholar). To further understand the role of Pak1 in the regulation of motility and growth of breast epithelial cells, we established stable breast cancer cell lines expressing T423E and H83L,H86L Pak1 mutants. The expression of kinase-active Pak1 mutants was accompanied by a significant stimulation of motility, invasiveness, and anchorage-independent growth of epithelial cells. The Pak1-linked enhanced ability of cells to grow in soft agar was preferentially sensitive to a specific MAPK inhibitor compared with p38 MAPK inhibitor, implying that Pak1 regulates anchorage-independent growth of epithelial cells via a MAPK kinase pathway. MCF-7 human breast cancer cells (4Vadlamudi R. Adam L. Tseng B. Costa L. Kumar R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2843-2846PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Antibodies were purchased from the following companies: Pak1 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); Vinculin from Sigma; anti-HA from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; phospho-MEK1, phospho-p42/44 MAPK, and phospho-p38 MAPK from New England Biolabs. Inhibitors SB203580 and PD980599 were purchased from Calbiochem. MCF-7 cells were sequentially transfected with pTak (Teton vector,CLONTECH) plus pNeomycin plasmid (pNeo) and pTet-Splice-HA-Pak1 (T423E) (21Sells M.A. Boyd J.T. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and hygromycin plasmid (pHyg,CLONTECH) using the calcium phosphate method. Forty-eight hours post transfection, cells were selected in medium containing 1000 μg/ml G418 (to retain the tetracycline-VP16 transactivator) and 200 μg/ml hygromycin (to select for the T423E Pak1-regulated expression vector). Stable cells expressing H83L,H86L Pak1 were transfected and selected with hygromycin. Expression of Pak1 mutants was verified by immunoblotting using anti-HA mAb. The cell migration assays were performed using the Boyden chambers using a confocal microscope (4Vadlamudi R. Adam L. Tseng B. Costa L. Kumar R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2843-2846PubMed Google Scholar). T423E cells were induced for 24 h with doxycycline (1 μg/ml) in DMEM containing 10% serum. Cells grown in the absence of doxycycline were used as control. After a short treatment with trypsin, the cells were washed, resuspended in DMEM/F-12 plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of doxycycline, and loaded on the upper well of a Boyden chamber at a concentration of 20,000 cells/well. The lower side of the separating filter was coated with chemoattractant (a thick layer of 1:2 diluted Matrigel (Life Technologies, Inc.) in serum-free DMEM/F-12. The number of cells that successfully migrated through the filter and invaded the 2-mm Matrigel layer in order to spread as well as those that remained on the upper side of the filter were counted by confocal microscopy after staining with propidium iodide (Sigma). The percentage of migrating cells compared with the total number of cells was recorded and represents the mean ± S.E. of triplicate wells from three separate experiments. For co-staining of filamentous actin and HA-tagged Pak1, 0.1 μm Alexa 546-conjugated phalloidin was included during incubation with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Slides were mounted and analyzed by a Zeiss-LSM inverted microscope or by confocal microscopy. Cell proliferation assays were performed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye method as described (4Vadlamudi R. Adam L. Tseng B. Costa L. Kumar R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2843-2846PubMed Google Scholar). Colony growth assays were performed as described previously (26Cox A.D. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly 1 ml of solution of 0.6% Difco agar in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS with insulin was layered onto 60 × 15-mm tissue culture plates. MCF-7 cell (10,000 cells) were mixed with 1 ml of 0.36% Bactoagar solution in DMEM prepared in a similar manner and layered on top of the 0.6% Bactoagar layer. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 21 days. For cells expressing T423 Pak1, doxycycline (1 μg/ml) was added where indicated. As a positive control, HRG 10 ng/ml was also included in the medium. When indicated, some cultures were treated with MEK1/2 inhibitor PD980599 (10 μm) and p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (10 μm). We have prepared the cell extracts and performed immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, kinase reactions, and DNA-binding gel shift assays following the methods described by us earlier (3Adam L.

Nine cases of 10% formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human breast carcinoma samples was processed for peroxidase anti-peroxidase immunohistochemical staining to reveal the Pak-1 expression. Briefly, the sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated through graded ethanol. The sections were then incubated with rabbit-anti-Pak-1 (1:50 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h, goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100 dilution, Sigma) for 1 h, and rabbit peroxidase anti-peroxidase (1:200 dilution, Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were washed three times with PBS after each incubation. Finally, the staining was visualized with diaminobenzidine-H2O2 and counterstained with hematoxylin. For specificity control, the sections were stained with the same concentration of normal rabbit IgG in place of the primary antibody. To study the influence of Pak1 kinase on the biology of epithelial breast cancer cells, we established stable cell lines with inducible expression of the activated form of Pak1 under the control of the tetracycline-regulated promoter. We used the T423E Pak1 mutant, which behaves as activated Pak1 kinase but retains its ability to bind Cdc42 and Rac1 (16Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bakoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 21Sells M.A. Boyd J.T. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). We also used another stable clone expressing the H83L,H86L Pak1 mutant, which lacks the ability to bind Cdc42/Rac1 but behaves as an activated Pak1 kinase (16Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bakoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 21Sells M.A. Boyd J.T. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). These Pak1 mutants allowed us to differentiate the effects that were caused by sequestering of Cdc42/Rac1, Pak1 kinase activity, or both. To induce the expression of T423E Pak1, MCF-7 cells stable transfected with Tet-T423E plasmid were treated with doxycycline for various time intervals or with different doses of doxycycline (Dox), and T423E Pak1 expression was analyzed by Western blotting analysis using an anti-HA tag monoclonal antibody. Doxycycline induced expression of T423E Pak1 protein in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figs.1, B and C). The identity of the induced band as T423E Pak1 was also confirmed by immunoblotting with an anti-Pak1 antibody. The levels of induced expression of T423E Pak1 were 3–5 times those of endogenous Pak1. To determine if the expressed protein was functional and retained its kinase activity, HA-tagged T423E Pak1 was immunoprecipitated from cells grown in serum-free conditions with an anti-HA mAb, and exogenously expressed Pak1 kinase activity was measured by in vitrokinase assay. Myelin basic protein was used as a substrate, and signal was quantitated by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). As shown in Fig. 1 D, Pak1 kinase activity was also induced by doxycycline in a dose-dependent manner. For subsequent studies, we used a 1 μg/ml dose of doxycycline, which could effectively induce about 3-fold induction of T423E Pak1 protein and its kinase activity as compared with endogenous Pak1 levels. The level of expression of H83L,H86L Pak1 in stable clones was 5–6-fold that of vector-transfected control cells. The kinase activity of H83L,H86L Pak1, however, was lower than that of T423E Pak1 cells, taking into account the 3-fold lower expression of T423E Pak1 (Fig.1 D, compare lanes 4 and6). We next analyzed the influence of Pak1 expression on the migration of MCF-7 cells using Boyden chamber assay. Vector-transfected cells showed low motility (Fig. 1 E). In contrast, induction of T423E Pak1 with doxycycline resulted in a significant increase in cell motility. HRG treatment was used as a positive control. H83L,H86L Pak1 mutant also induced motility of epithelial cells to a level similar to that induced with HRG treatment. Recently, it was shown that kinase activity affects directional cell movement (21Sells M.A. Boyd J.T. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Although both active mutants (T423E Pak1 and H83L,H86L Pak1) stimulated cell migration, the higher activity of T423E suggests that kinase activity and its localization and interaction with other proteins also play a role in increasing the migratory potential of MCF-7 cells. The subcellular localization of active Pak1 mutants was visualized by immunofluorescence staining for tagged HA and actin. MCF-7 cells expressing T423E and H83L,H86L Pak1 exhibited distinct actin localization. Cells expressing T423E Pak1 showed the presence of filopodia, and HA-Pak1 was predominantly localized at the cell periphery that corresponds to the filopodia structures (Fig.2 A). Cells expressing T423E Pak1 showed very few stress fiber compared with vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2 A) and exhibited scattered phenotype. Thirty to forty percent of cells expressing T423E Pak1 generated a leading edge reminiscent of motile phenotype. In contrast, cells expressing H83L,H86L Pak1 showed lower levels of filopodia or stress fibers but exhibited extensive membrane ruffling to which HA-Pak1 staining was localized. Formation and induction of actin-containing structures, including filopodia, ruffles, and leading edge, and dissolution of stress fibers by active kinase mutants, which in turn loosen their contacts with the substratum, may provide an advantage for the cells and may have contributed to the increased migration observed in Boyden chamber assays (Fig. 2 A). Kinase-deficient Pak1 can suppress transformation that is mediated by Ras, Rho, and Rac1 (24Tang Y. Chen Z. Ambrose D. Liu J. Gibbs J.B. Chernoff J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4454-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 25Tang Y., Yu, J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) in Rat1 cells but not in NIH3T3 cells, suggesting that the transformation-blocking function of Pak1 depends on the cellular context. To examine the potential influence of regulatable expression of kinase-active Pak1 on the growth characteristics of breast epithelial cancer cells, we measured the growth rate and ability of cells to grow in an anchorage-independent manner. Expression of kinase-active Pak1 mutants had very little or no significant effect on the growth rate of MCF-7 cells on plastic (data not shown). Kinase-active Pak1 mutants did, however, significantly enhance the ability of MCF-7 cells to form colonies on soft agar (Fig.2 B). There was no difference in the number or size of colonies between vector-transfected control cells and uninduced T423E-expressing cells. Doxycycline-mediated increase in the level of expression of T423E Pak1 was accompanied by a significant reproducible enhancement of the ability of cells to form colonies in soft agar comparable with that of the cells treated with HRG as a positive control. Cells expressing H83L,H86L Pak1 also exhibited a profound increase in ability to grow in an anchorage-independent manner (Fig.2 B). This finding contradicts an earlier observation (24Tang Y. Chen Z. Ambrose D. Liu J. Gibbs J.B. Chernoff J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4454-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) showing the inability of H83L,H86L Pak1 in Rat1 cells to form colonies in soft agar. It is possible that these different results reflect the use of fibroblast versus epithelial cells in these two studies. To study the biochemical basis of the increased ability of MCF-7 cells to form colonies in soft agar, we analyzed the signaling pathways activated in cells expressing T423E Pak1. We used doxycycline to induce the expression of T423E Pak1 and analyzed the activation status of the signaling components by blotting with phosphospecific antibodies. Both T423E and H83L,H86L Pak1 mutants demonstrated increased p42/44 MAPK activity (2–4-fold) over vector-transfected cells. T423E Pak1 mutant demonstrated a modest increase in the level of p38 MAPK (1.6–2-fold, Fig. 3 A). Both Pak1 mutants exhibited increased AP-1-DNA binding activity, which was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 3 B,upper panel). Results of supershift experiments using specific antibodies that recognize specific components of the AP-1 complex suggested that the increased AP-1 DNA binding activity was caused primarily by c-Jun and JunD transcription factors (Fig.3 B, lower panel). The exhibition of similar patterns of super shifts of AP-1 DNA complex by both Pak1 mutants suggested the possibility of regulation of c-Jun and JunD transcription factors by the Pak1 pathway. To further characterize the regulation of the p42/44 MAPK pathway by Pak1, we used doxycycline to induce T423E Pak1 expression in MCF-7 as a function of time. Consistent with the earlier results, p42/44 MAPK and its upstream kinase MEK1/2 were activated in a time-dependent manner by the induction of Pak1 (Fig. 3 C). When vector-transfected cells were exposed to doxycycline, the p42/44 MAPK pathway was not induced (data not shown). To address the possibility that activation of p42/44 MAPK contributed to the anchorage-independent growth by active Pak1 mutants, the soft agar experiment was repeated in the presence or absence of PD98059, a specific MAPK inhibitor, or SB203580, a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor. As illustrated in Fig. 3 D, inclusion of a nontoxic dose of PD98059 blocked the T423E Pak1-mediated increase in anchorage-independent growth; inclusion of SB203580 had a small inhibitory effect compared with PD98059. Nonspecific inhibitory effects of PD98059 did not cause the observed blockade effect of PD98059 on anchorage-independent growth, because it failed to suppress the anchorage-independent growth supported by HRG treatment (Fig.3 D). These results suggest that Pak1 plays a role in activating p42/44 MAPK. Although it is well accepted that Pak1 activates Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 MAPK pathways, there are contradictory reports on whether Pak1 activates p42/44 MAPK (12Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 426-6438Crossref Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 23Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 3707-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The use of different cell systems or the use of transient and inducible systems could have caused the variation between the earlier reports and the results presented in this study. These results suggest that p42/44 MAPK may have a possible preferential role of supporting the anchorage-independent growth of cells expressing kinase-active T423E Pak1. Earlier studies with Pak homologues inSaccharomyces cervisiae (Ste20) showed that Pak homologues have a role in cytokinesis and in mitosis (28Cvrckova F. De Vigilio C. Manser E. Pringle J.R. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1817-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 29Wu C. Lytvyn V. Thomas D.V. Leberer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30623-30626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To determine whether extended expression of the mammalian Pak1 homologue affected cell cycle progression, we induced expression of kinase-active Pak1 by treating MCF-7 cells expressing T423E for 72 h with doxycycline. Cell cycle progression was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, and there were no significant differences between the cell cycle progression of these treated cells and that of the control vector-transfected cells (data not shown). We next examined whether prolonged activation of Pak1 could influence the organization of mitotic spindles and thus possibly contribute to anchorage-independent growth via modifying the status of DNA ploidy and genomic instability. To explore this possibility, MCF-7 cells expressing Tet vector or T423E Pak1 were treated with doxycycline for 72 h to induce the expression of active Pak1. Cells were costained with monoclonal antibody against β-tubulin (green) to mark spindles and polyclonal antibody against the BTAK protein (red) to localize the centromere. The cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig.4, cells expressing activated Pak1 exhibited multiple spindles with several orientations and centromere spots (arrows); vector-transfected cells did not show multiple spindles. For quantitation, we scored 40 mitotic cells per field in eight different fields (× 20) and counted cells exhibiting multiple spindles by analyzing each of them at a higher magnification. Induction of kinase-active T423E Pak1 for 72 h resulted in the appearance of multiple spindles in 11 ± 1% of mitotic cells compared with <2% in vector-transfected cells or T423E cells without doxycycline. The multiple spindles in T423E Pak1-expressing MCF-7 cells could have been caused by defects in cytokinesis, but we could not differentiate this possibility in the present study. Additional studies are needed to delineate the potential role of Pak1 in mitosis, including the effect of abnormal Pak activation on cellular events responsible for segregation of mitotic spindles. Since HRG activates Pak1 activity and breast cancer progression (3Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Kondapaka S.B. Chernoff J. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol.

Vadlamudi R. Mandal M. Chernoff J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12041-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Pak1 expression and activity may be closely associated with the invasive phenotypes of breast cancer cells. To explore this possibility, we analyzed the level of Pak1 expression and activity in small numbers of grade II and grade III breast tumor biopsies. As shown in Fig. 5 A, there was a significant increase in the expression and kinase activity of Pak1 in grade III tumors, as compared with grade II tumors (4Vadlamudi R. Adam L. Tseng B. Costa L. Kumar R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2843-2846PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, increased expression of another band at 55 kDa was also observed in grade III tumors. Since Pak1 antiserum is also known to react with the Pak2 isoform, we believe that Pak2 may also be elevated in grade III samples. We also examined the level of endogenous Pak1 activity in a panel of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer cell lines grown in complete medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Invasive breast cell lines (MDA-MB435, MDA-MB231) exhibited a significant elevation in the level of Pak activity as compared with noninvasive breast cancer cell lines (MDA-453, BT-474, and MCF-7) (Fig. 5 B). Although Pak1 expression was observed in MCF-7 cells, the level of Pak1 kinase activity in MCF-7 cells was significantly lower as compared with its levels higher in invasive cells, suggesting that Pak activity rather than the amount Pak1 may be responsible for the phenotype. Similarly, grade III tumors (four out of five) exhibited an elevation in the level of Pak kinase activity compared with grade II tumors. There was no direct correlation between the expression level of Pak1 protein and its activity. It is possible that the Pak1 kinase activity in tumor cells may be stimulated by mutation or signaling pathways or autocrine/paracrine growth factors. Taken together, these observations support the notion that Pak1 activity rather than the expression of Pak1 protein may be closely related with the invasiveness of breast cancer. We next analyzed the expression of Pak1 in a panel of tumor biopsies by immunohistochemical staining. As shown in Fig. 5(C–H), there were low levels of Pak1 immunoreactivity in low grade tumors (F, G). In contrast, poorly differentiated ductal carcinomas of the breast (documented as grade III) demonstrated a significant intense Pak1 staining (Figs. 5, C–E). Fig. 5 F displays grade 2 breast carcinoma showing low level staining for Pak1. A larger study is needed to further establish the validity of these new results. In summary, our findings demonstrated the ability of Pak1 activity to stimulate the growth of breast epithelial cancer cells in an anchorage-independent manner and to promote an abnormal organization of mitotic spindles. We also provide new evidence to suggest a close relationship between the levels of Pak1 expression and activity Pak1 and invasive phenotypes of human breast cancer cell lines and tumor grades.

A potential role for the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin in vascular development was initially suggested by studies demonstrating the presence of oncofetal fibronectin around blood vessels during development and wound healing and in tumor tissue (7Castellani P.

Interestingly, mice lacking fibronectin die early in development from a collection of defects, which includes an improperly formed vasculature (11George E.L. Georges E.N. Patel-King R.S. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Development. 1993; 119: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, mice lacking the fibronectin receptor α5β1, one of several fibronectin receptors (12Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1985; 40: 191-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), also die early in development and exhibit some vascular and cardiac defects (13Yang J.T. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O.

This circumstantial evidence suggests potential roles for fibronectin and its receptor, integrin α5β1, in angiogenesis. We have recently shown that integrin α5β1and its ligand fibronectin are expressed at significantly increased levels in neovessels induced by growth factors or solid tumors (15Kim S. Bell K. Mousa S.A. Varner J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1345-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Notably, antibody, peptide, and small molecule antagonists of integrin α5β1 and fibronectin block growth factor- and tumor-induced angiogenesis (15Kim S. Bell K. Mousa S.A. Varner J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1345-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Interestingly, antagonists of another fibronectin-binding integrin, αvβ3, also inhibit angiogenesis (16Brooks P.C. Clark R.A. Cheresh D.A.

Science. 1995; 270: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). Antagonists of both of these integrins substantially block angiogenesis induced by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)1 but not by vascular endothelial growth factor, suggesting that these integrins regulate similar pathways of angiogenesis (15Kim S.

Since antagonists of both integrins independently and substantially block the same pathway of angiogenesis, it is possible that these two integrins interact during angiogenesis. Previous studies have indicated that the occupancy of one integrin by its ligand can inhibit the functions of other integrins (23Blystone S.D. Graham I.L. Lindberg F.P. Brown E.J. J.

Cell. 1996; 7: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For example, ligation of integrin αvβ3 has been shown to inhibit cell migration and phagocytosis mediated by integrin α5β1 (23Blystone S.D. Graham I.L. Lindberg F.P. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Interactions between individual integrins are known as cross-talk. Integrin cross-talk appears to depend on the actions of signal transduction molecules (23Blystone S.D. Graham I.L. Lindberg F.P. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 24Pacifici R. Roman J. Kimble R. Civitelli R. Brownfield C.M. Bizzarri C. J.

For example, integrin αvβ3 suppression of α5β1-mediated migration is dependent on calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (28Blystone S.D. Slater S.E. Williams M.P. Crow M.T. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In this report, we provide evidence that integrin α5β1 regulates the functions of integrin αvβ3 in vitro and in vivo. Antagonists of integrin α5β1suppress αvβ3-mediated focal contact formation and cell migration without inhibiting cellular attachment. This inhibition of αvβ3 function is dependent on the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and can be blocked by inhibitors of PKA. Culture media and reagents were from Irvine Scientific (Irvine, CA).

Ten-day-old chicken eggs were purchased from McIntyre Poultry (Ramona, CA). Basic fibroblast growth factor was purchased from Genzyme, Inc. (Cambridge, MA). PKA assay kits were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Round 1-mm-thick glass coverslips were coated with 1 μg/ml fibronectin, vitronectin, collagen, or poly-l-lysine for 1 h at room temperature, then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C. HUVECS were removed from culture dishes by trypsizination, washed in serum-free culture medium, and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mmCaCl2, 0.2 mm MnCl2, 1% BSA. Cells were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C on coated coverslips. Cells were incubated in the presence of 25 μg/ml anti-α5β1, anti-αvβ3, anti-αvβ5, control antibodies, or no antibodies for 60 min. Coverslips were then washed to remove unbound cells, fixed for 5 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100 for 3 min. Coverslips were incubated with 1.25 μg/ml anti-paxillin antibodies, 0.2 μg/ml anti-vinculin antibodies, 1:500 dilution of anti-integrin β3 monoclonal antibodies, or 2.7 μg/ml anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies in 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were well washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 10 μg/ml goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were well washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and mounted in Gelvatol, prior to confocal fluorescent microsopy. Cell adhesion assays were performed as described (15Kim S. Bell K. Mousa S.A. Varner J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1345-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). In brief, the wells of 48-well non-tissue culture-treated culture dishes (Costar, Inc.) were coated with 5 μg/ml vitronectin, fibronectin, Del-1, or collagen for 1 h at 37 °C and blocked with 2% heat-denatured bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. Fifty thousand cells in 25 μg/ml anti-α5β1 function blocking antibody (JBS5), 25 μg/ml anti-αvβ3function blocking antibody (LM609), 25 μg/ml anti-α2β1 function blocking antibody, 25 μg/ml anti-β1 function blocking antibody (P4C10), or 25 μg/ml control antibody (W6/32) in adhesion buffer (Hepes-buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and either 0 mm or 0.2 mm MnCl2) were allowed to adhere to dishes for 20 min at 37 °C. In some experiments, dibutyryl cAMP was used at 500 μm and forskolin was used at 20 μg/ml. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, with triplicate samples per condition. The data are presented as percentage of adhesion exhibited by the positive control (adhesion medium alone) ± standard error of the mean. Migration assays were performed essentially as described (15Kim S. Bell K. Mousa S.A. Varner J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1345-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The lower side of 8-μm pore Transwell inserts (Costar, Inc.) were coated with 5 μg/ml fibronectin, vitronectin, Del-1, collagen, or no protein for 1 h and were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. HUVECS (25,000) were added to the upper chamber of inserts in migration buffer (Hepes-buffered M199 medium containing 1% BSA, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.8 mm MgCl2, and either 0 or 0.2 mm MnCl2, as well as 25 μg/ml various antibodies or 10 μm SJ749 or XU065. In some experiments, cells were also incubated in the presence of final concentrations of 20 μm H8, 25 μmautocamtide 2, 50 nm calphostin C, or 48 nmH89, 500 μm dibutyryl cAMP, or 20 μg/ml forskolin. Some experiments were performed in the presence of 200 μg/ml cycloheximide, after a 4-h preincubation in 200 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cells were allowed to migrate from the upper to the lower chamber for 4 h at 37 °C. Non-migratory cells were removed from the upper chamber by wiping the upper surface with an absorbent tip. Cells that had migrated to the lower side of the Transwell insert were then fixed for 15 min with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and with a 2% crystal violet solution. After extensive water washing to remove excess crystal violet, the number of cells that had migrated (to the bottom of the insert) were counted in three representative high power (200×) fields per insert. No cells were found on the culture dish in which the insert was placed. The data are presented as number of cells migrating ± standard error of the mean. Angiogenesis assays were performed as described (15Kim S. Bell K. Mousa S.A. Varner J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1345-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Briefly, chorioallantoic membranes (CAMs) of 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs were stimulated with cortisone acetate-pretreated filter discs saturated in 1 μg/ml bFGF or saline. Twenty-five μg of function blocking anti-α5β1 in or a control antibody (25 μl), 25 μm cyclic peptide (CRRETAWAC) or scrambled control peptide (CATAERWRC) in 25 μl, or 25 μl of saline were applied to the growth factor-saturated filter disc 24 h later. In some cases, 50 μm H8, 480 nm H89, 50 nm calphostin C, 20 μm forskolin, or 500 μm dibutyryl cAMP were added to CAMs. CAMs were harvested on the 4th day of stimulation by fixation with a drop of 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline prior to excision of the stimulated area. Blood vessel branch points in the 5-mm disc were counted at a magnification of 30 under fiber optic illumination in a blinded fashion (19Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M.P. Cheresh D.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 129: 257-269PubMed Google Scholar). At least 10 embryos were used per treatment group. Each experiment was performed a minimum of three times. Data were evaluated in terms of average number of blood vessel branch points per treatment group ± standard error of the mean. Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test. Culture plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg/ml poly-l-lysine, 10 μg/ml fibronectin, or 10 μg/ml vitronectin. Plates were washed and blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C. Additional plates were coated with 25 μg/ml goat anti-mouse antibodies for 2 h at 37 °C, blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C, and incubated in 10 μg/ml anti-α5β1 or control antibodies overnight at 4 °C. HUVECS were trypsinized and resuspended in adhesion buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mmCaCl2, 0.2 mm MnCl2, 1% BSA). Cells were plated on matrix protein or antibody-coated plates in medium or the presence of 25 μg/ml anti-α5β1 or control antibodies (W6/32, anti-MHC) for 60 min. Plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and extracted with cold extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 25 μg/ml leupeptin). Protein kinase A activity was assessed using a kit from Life Technologies, Inc. Briefly, equal volumes of lysate and reaction mixture containing final concentrations of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 50 μm kemptide (protein kinase A-specific substrate), 3000 Ci/mmol [γ-32P]ATP, and 100 μm ATP were combined for 5 min at 30 °C. Total PKA in each sample was measured by performing the assay in the presence of 10 μm cAMP. Background PKA activity in test and total PKA samples were determined by performing the assay in the presence of a PKA inhibitor peptide, PKI-(6–22) amide. Twenty μl samples of reaction mixtures were spotted onto phosphocellulose discs, air-dried, and washed repeatedly with 1% (v/v) phosphoric acid in water. Incorporated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Activated PKA was calculated from the ratio of pmol/min test sample PKA to pmol/min total PKA. PKA activity in triplicate samples was measured and experiments were repeated at least three times. Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test. HUVECs were detached from culture dishes by trysinization, washed, and resuspended in serum-free culture medium in the presence or absence of 200 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cells were plated on cell culture plates that had been coated with vitronectin, collagen, or fibronectin and blocked with bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C prior to lysis with boiling SDS sample buffer. Fifty micrograms of protein from each lysate was electrophoresed in 6% or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose and then incubated in anti-fibronectin, anti-integrin α5 or β3 cytoplasmic tail, or anti-protein kinase A catalytic subunit antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Blots were incubated in a chemiluminescent substrate for horseradish peroxidase and then exposed to film. Recent studies show that antagonists of integrin α5β1 or αvβ3can substantially block growth factor and tumor-induced angiogenesis in chicken embryos and in human skin transplanted onto SCID mice (15Kim S.

Pathol. 1997; 151: 975-983PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, antagonists of these adhesion receptors block angiogenesis induced by bFGF but not by vascular endothelial growth factor, suggesting that these integrins may cooperate by regulating the same angiogenic pathways (15Kim S. Bell K. Mousa S.A. Varner J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1345-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 22Friedlander M. Brooks P.C. Shaffer R.W. Kincaid C.M. Varner J.A. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). To evaluate the interactions of α5β1 and αvβ3in angiogenesis, experiments were designed to examine their contributions to endothelial cell migration in vitro, as endothelial cell migration is an essential feature of angiogenesis. As shown in Fig. 1 (A andB), function blocking antibodies selective for integrin α5β1 blocked both the adhesion and migration of HUVECs on fibronectin, while antibodies against integrin αvβ3 had little effect. Surprisingly, both anti-α5β1 and anti-αvβ3 inhibited endothelial cell migration on vitronectin (Fig. 1 C), yet only anti-αvβ3 blocked adhesion to vitronectin (Fig. 1 D). In contrast, anti-α5β1 had no impact on collagen-mediated cell migration, which depends on integrin α2β1 (Fig. 1 E). Similar results were observed for adult dermal microvascular endothelial cells (data not shown). Anti-α5β1 blocked αvβ3−mediated cell migration to similar extents when measured after 2, 4, or 18 h of incubation time (data not shown). Anti-α5β1 blocked αvβ3-mediated migration but not adhesion to the same extent in the absence or in the presence of high levels (200 μm) of Mn2+, a divalent cation that enhances the affinity of αvβ3 for its ligand (data not shown). Therefore, α5β1 function is required for endothelial cell migration on vitronectin and other substrates of integrin αvβ3, as well as on fibronectin. Interestingly, both antibody and small molecule antagonists of integrin α5β1 block cell migration on vitronectin (Fig. 1 F) without affecting cell attachment (Fig.1 C; Ref. 15Kim S. Bell K. Mousa S.A. Varner J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1345-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Thus, antibodies directed against α5β1 inhibit αvβ3-mediated cell migration by antagonizing α5β1 ligation, rather than by cross-linking cell surface α5β1 molecules. These results indicate that integrin α5β1selectively impacts αvβ3-mediated cellular migration without influencing αvβ3-dependent adhesion, suggesting that these integrins may function in a cooperative manner on the surface of endothelial cells. Endothelial cells readily secrete fibronectin during angiogenesis (8Clark R.A.F. DellaPelle P. Manseua E. Lanigan J.M. Dvorak H.F. Colvin R.B. J. Invest.

In fact, endothelial cell-derived oncofetal fibronectin specifically accumulates around tumor-associated blood vessels (7Castellani P. Viale G. Dorcaratto A. Nicolo G. Kaczmarek J. Querze G. Zardi L.

Biotech. 1997; 15: 1271-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that antibodies directed to the cell-binding domain of fibronectin block angiogenesis (15Kim S. Bell K. Mousa S.A. Varner J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1345-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The indirect inhibition of endothelial cell migration on vitronectin by α5β1 antagonists (Fig. 1) suggests the possibility that endothelial cell-derived fibronectin may influence cell migration on vitronectin. Indeed, cell migration on vitronectin is partially inhibited by function-blocking antibodies directed against the cell-binding domain of fibronectin, but not by antibodies directed against the N terminus of fibronectin (Fig.2 A). In contrast, anti-fibronectin antibodies (Fig. 2 B) do not block cellular migration on collagen, even though endothelial cells cultured on either vitronectin (Fig. 2 C) or collagen (data not shown) synthesize fibronectin. These results suggest that ligation of α5β1 by endothelial cell-secreted fibronectin specifically regulates αvβ3function but not that of other integrins. To determine further whether ligation of α5β1 by endothelial cell secreted fibronectin potentiates integrin αvβ3function, endothelial cells were treated with cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis and then evaluated for their abilities to migrate on fibronectin, vitronectin, or collagen substrates. Endothelial cell synthesis of fibronectin is inhibited by cycloheximide pretreatment of endothelial cells (Fig. 2 C). Inhibition of protein synthesis results in an overall reduction in cellular migration rates compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2, D–F). In contrast to untreated cells, the migration of cycloheximide-treated cells on vitronectin is not inhibited by anti-α5β1antibodies (Fig. 2 E). However, migration on vitronectin is inhibited to the same extent by anti-αvβ3antibodies in treated and untreated cells. In addition, in contrast to untreated cells, migration of cycloheximide-treated cells on vitronectin is refractory to anti-fibronectin antibodies (Fig.2 F). Migration on collagen is equally sensitive to anti-α2β1 and insensitive to anti-α5β1 antibodies in cycloheximide-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 2 E). Migration on fibronectin is equally sensitive to anti-α5β1 treatment in cycloheximide-treated and untreated cells (data not shown). In fact, expression levels of α5 and β3 integrins measured by immunoblotting with anti-cytoplasmic tail antibodies in treated and untreated cells remains unchanged as does expression of protein kinase A (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that fibronectin synthesized by HUVECS contributes to vitronectin migration based on its ability to ligate integrin α5β1. Temporal prerequisites to cellular migration are the attachment and spreading of cells on the extracellular matrix, with concomitant formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions. Since antagonists of α5β1 do not impact αvβ3-mediated cell attachment but do inhibit migration, we examined the effect of α5β1 antagonists on cell spreading and focal contact formation to establish the earliest integrin αvβ3-mediated events that are affected by inhibition of α5β1. During spreading on vitronectin (within 30 min after initial cell attachment), endothelial cells form stress fibers (Fig.3 A) as well as focal adhesions incorporating paxillin, vinculin, integrin β3 (Fig.3 B), and phosphotyrosine (data not shown). Integrin-mediated signal transduction during this time leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins such as paxillin and focal adhesion kinase. In the presence of integrin α5β1antagonists, endothelial cells generally appear less polarized than in control cells (Fig. 3 A). Instead, these cells acquire a rounded, pancake-like morphology. Notably, stress fiber formation i"

The ADAM disintegrin domains generally lack RGD motifs, and their receptors are virtually unknown. Here we show that integrin α9β1specifically interacts with the recombinant ADAMs-12 and -15 disintegrin domains in an RGD-independent manner. We also show that interaction between ADAM-12 or -15 and α9β1supports cell-cell interaction. Interestingly, the cation requirement and integrin activation status required for α9β1/ADAM-mediated cell adhesion and cell-cell interaction is similar to those required for known integrin-extracellular matrix interaction. These results are quite different from recent reports that ADAM-2/α6β1 interaction during sperm/egg fusion requires an integrin activation status distinct from that for extracellular matrix interaction. These results suggest that α9β1 may be a major receptor for ADAMs that lack RGD motifs, and that, considering a wide distribution of ADAMs and α9β1, this interaction may be of potential biological and pathological significance.

The catalytically active metalloprotease domain of several ADAMs has been reported to mediate proteolytic cleavage of cell-surface proteins in some of these critical biological processes. The disintegrin domain of ADAMs is a potential integrin ligand, but generally lacks the RGD motif (unlike RGD-containing snake venom disintegrins): Human ADAM-15 is the only ADAM that has an RGD motif in its disintegrin-like domain (14Kratzschmar J. Lum L. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4593-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Integrin α6β1 has been reported to interact with the disintegrin domains of fertilin α and β (ADAM-1 and -2) complex that has no RGD motif during fertilization (2Almeida E.A. Huovila A.P.

Integrin αvβ3 has been reported to specifically bind to the disintegrin domain of human ADAM-15 in an RGD-dependent manner (15Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26236-26247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This raised doubts about the role of ADAM-15 as a genuine integrin ligand. ADAM-15 (metargidin) is widely expressed in various tissues and cell types (14Kratzschmar J. Lum L. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4593-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,17Lum L. Reid M.S. Blobel C.P. J. Biol.

Raines E.W. Ross R. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). ADAM-12 has been implicated in myoblast fusion during myogenesis (5Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T.

The cysteine-rich domain of ADAM-12 has a putative fusion peptide and a short hydrophobic stretch (19Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol.

The truncated mouse ADAM-12, which lacks the metalloprotease domain, enhances fusion of C2C12 myoblastic cells in vitro (5Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the disintegrin and/or cysteine-rich domains of ADAM-12 should be involved in cell-cell interaction during myoblast fusion. Since the ADAM-12 gene is activated in condensed mesenchymal cells that give rise to skeletal muscle, bones, and visceral organs (21Kurisaki T. Masuda A. Osumi N. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 73: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), ADAM-12 may be involved in development of other organs as well. A major question is whether the non-RGD disintegrin domains of ADAMs interact with integrins. In the present study, we designed experiments to address this question using recombinant disintegrin domain fragment and cells expressing recombinant ADAMs. We demonstrated a novel interaction between integrins and ADAMs that is RGD-independent and may play crucial roles in cell-cell interaction during development and in pathological conditions. Hybridomas for antibodies TS2/16 (anti-β1, activating) and AIIB2 (anti-β1, function-blocking) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing different integrins have been described (15Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol.

After selection with G-418 (1 mg/ml of medium), cells stably expressing human integrins were cloned by limited dilution and designated α9-K562. α9-K562 cells express α9 (as α9β1) as detected by flow cytometry in FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) with the anti-α9antibody Y9A2 (23Wang A.

A, expression of α9β1 on K562 cells. Parent K562 cells or α9-K562 cells were stained with control mouse IgG (dotted line) or Y9A2 (anti-α9 mAb) (solid line), followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. Stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The data suggest that α9-K562 cells homogeneously express α9β1. B, expression of EGFP or EGFP containing ADAMs on CHO cells. The IRES2-EGFP bicistronic vector, in which both EGFP and ADAMs are encoded in a single mRNA with two separate translation starting sites, was used. EGFP vector alone, EGFP vector containing the full-length human ADAM-15 cDNA, the truncated human ADAM-15 cDNA fragment encoding residues 420–814 lacking pro- and metalloprotease domains (ADAM-15/PM−), or the full-length mouse ADAM-12 cDNA (solid line) was transfected into CHO cells. These cells and mock-transfected (thin line) CHO cells were analyzed 48 h after transfection. Expression was analyzed by flow cytometry (excitation at 488 nm and emission at 507 nm). Transient EGFP expression was used as a marker of ADAM expression, and typically approximately 30% of transfected cells are EGFP-positive.C, α9β1 and ADAM-15 or ADAM-12 mediate cell-cell interaction. CHO cells transiently expressing ADAMs were plated in wells of 96-well plastic culture plates, and grown overnight to near confluence. Fluorescence-labeled α9-K562 or parent K562 cells were added to the wells and incubated with CHO cells in RPMI 1640 medium. After rinsing the wells to remove unbound cells, bound cells were quantified using a fluorescent plate reader at 485 nm for excitation and at 530 nm for emission. Cell-cell interaction was assayed in the absence (closed bar) or presence (open bar) of the anti-α9 mAb, Y9A2 (10 μg/ml). Note that only approximately 30% of the transfected CHO cells is EGFP positive. Thus, binding of 15–20% of added α9-K562 cells is substantial. The data suggest that ADAM-15 (wt and truncated) and ADAM-12 on the cell-surface specifically interact with α9β1 on the surface of apposing cells and mediate cell-cell interaction.

These cDNA fragments were subcloned into the BamHI site of the modified pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), in which a 6-His sequence was inserted between the thrombin cleavage site and theBamHI site. Synthesis of the GST fusion protein of the ADAM-15 disintegrin-like domain was induced in Escherichia coli DH5α by adding 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in culture medium as described previously (24Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst .). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). Protein was extracted from the bacterial suspension by sonication and purified using glutathione-agarose (Sigma) affinity chromatography. The recombinant wild type fusion proteins used in this study are shown in Fig. 1 A. Protein concentration was calculated from absorbance at 280 nm. We calculated the extinction coefficients based on the amino acid sequence using the ExPASy Protparam tool available from the ExPASy web site (25Gill S. Von Hippel P. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5058) Google Scholar). The GST fusion protein has a 6-His sequence inserted between its thrombin cleavage site and disintegrin domain. The GST fusion protein was digested with thrombin (Sigma; 1 unit/1 mg of GST fusion protein) at room temperature for 6 h. The GST portion was removed by passing the digested materials through a GSH-agarose column. The disintegrin fragment was further purified by nickel-nitriloacetic acid affinity chromatography. The disintegrin domain was eluted with 250 mm imidazole. Imidazole was removed using a G10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Adhesion assays were performed as described previously (15Zhang X.P.

Remaining protein binding sites were blocked by incubating with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Calbiochem) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, CHO cells (105 cells/well) in 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 1% BSA were added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After unbound cells were removed by rinsing the wells with PBS, bound cells were quantified by measuring endogenous phosphatase activity (26Prater C.A. Plotkin J. Jaye D. Frazier W.A. J.

These cDNA contain a signal sequence (of ADAM-15) and a Myc tag sequence just after the signal sequence. These cDNAs were verified by DNA sequencing, and subcloned into theNheI site of the pIRES2-EGFP vector. Full-length mouse ADAM-12 cDNA (5Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y.

After 48 h, EGFP expression was determined by flow cytometry. 96-well plastic culture plates (Corning) were plated with CHO cells transiently expressing EGFP and ADAM protein (5 × 104/well), and cultured overnight. K562 or α9-K562 cells were labeled with 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The labeled K562 cells (104/well) were added to the CHO cell monolayer expressing EGFP and ADAM protein and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C in RPMI 1640. After rinsing the wells with RPMI 1640 three times to remove unbound cells, bound cells were quantified by assaying fluorescence (excitation 485 nm, emission 530 nm) using a FL500 microplate fluorescence reader (Bio Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). In soluble disintegrin competition experiments, soluble bacterial disintegrin domains were first added to labeled α9-K562 cells in RPMI 1640 medium and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C (the volume of the soluble disintegrin was 10% of total). α9-K562 cells were then incubated with a monolayer of CHO cells expressing ADAM-12 or -15 for 90 min at 37 °C. In some experiments, Hepes-Tyrode buffer containing 2 mm Ca2+, 2 mmMg2+, or 1 mm Mn2+ was used instead of RPMI 1640 to determine the ion dependence of the cell to cell interaction. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the unique site elimination method (31Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The presence of mutations was verified by DNA sequencing. Flow cytometry was performed as described previously (27Takada Y. Ylanne J. Mandelman D. Puzon W. Ginsberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the recombinant disintegrin-like domain of human ADAM-15 binds to αvβ3 in an RGD-dependent manner (15Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J.

However, a mouse ADAM-15 homologue has recently been reported to have a TDD sequence instead of an RGD sequence in the putative integrin-binding site of its disintegrin domain (17Lum L. Reid M.S. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26236-26247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We generated a recombinant mouse ADAM-15 disintegrin fragment (Fig. 1 A) and studied whether it supports αvβ3-mediated cell adhesion. We did not detect significant adhesion of β3-CHO cells that express hamster αv/human β3 hybrid to the mouse ADAM-15 disintegrin domain (Fig. 1 B). We studied whether other integrin receptors bind to the mouse ADAM-15 disintegrin domain using CHO cells expressing different recombinant integrins. Parent CHO cells express α5β1and αvβ1, but do not express β2 or β3 (27Takada Y. Ylanne J. Mandelman D. Puzon W. Ginsberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). wt-GST (GST alone, a negative control) does not support adhesion to any integrins tested. GST-FN (a positive control: the rat fibronectin 8–11th type III repeats) supported adhesion to all of the cell lines tested. We found that the mouse ADAM-15 disintegrin domain supported adhesion of α9-CHO cells (which express human α9/hamster β1 hybrid), but did not support adhesion of parent CHO cells and CHO cells expressing other integrins, including α2β1, α3β1, α5β1, α6β1, and αvβ3, except for α4β1, which weakly bound to mouse ADAM-15 (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that α9β1 recognizes the mouse ADAM-15 disintegrin domain. Adhesion to the human and mouse ADAM-15 disintegrin domains was determined as a function of substrate concentration (Fig.1 C). α9-CHO cells showed maximum adhesion to both human and mouse ADAM-15 disintegrin domains at the coating concentration of 20 μg/ml protein. β3-CHO cells showed maximal adhesion to human ADAM-15 disintegrin domain at 5 μg/ml coating concentration, but never showed significant adhesion to mouse ADAM-15 disintegrin domain at the highest coating concentration used (50 μg/ml). These results are consistent with the previous results that αvβ3 recognizes ADAM-15 in an RGD-dependent manner (15Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7345-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We studied whether mutation of the RGD motif in the putative integrin-binding site of the ADAM-15 disintegrin domain affects adhesion to α9β1. α9-CHO cells adhered to the two human ADAM-15 disintegrin domain mutants, human/SGA (in which the RGD sequence is mutated to SGA (Ref. 15Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7345-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar)) and human/TDD (in which the RGD sequence is mutated to TDD), as well as to wild-type human and mouse ADAM-15 disintegrin domains. These results suggest that α9β1 recognizes ADAM-15 in an RGD-independent manner. Adhesion of α9-CHO cells to these recombinant proteins was completely blocked by Y9A2, an anti-human α9 integrin monoclonal antibody (23Wang A. Yokosaki Y. Ferrando R. Balmes J. Sheppard D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 D), suggesting that this adhesion is specific to α9β1. These results suggest that α9β1 may bind to other non-RGD ADAMs. We studied whether another non-RGD ADAM, human and mouse ADAM-12, or meltrin-α, which lacks the RGD motif, binds to α9β1 using CHO cells expressing different recombinant integrins. We found that the human and mouse ADAM-12 disintegrin domains supported adhesion of α9-CHO cells, but not of parent CHO cells or cells expressing the other integrins we tested, except for α4β1 and αvβ3, which weakly bound to this protein (Fig. 2 A). The α9-CHO cells showed maximum adhesion to both the human and mouse ADAM-12 disintegrin domains at a coating concentration of 20 μg of protein/ml (Fig. 2 B). This interaction is also blocked by the anti-α9 mAb Y9A2 (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that ADAM-12 also specifically interacts with α9β1. We studied whether non-recombinant α9β1binds to ADAM-12 and -15 using Ntera-2 human embryonic carcinoma cells that express α9 and β1 on the surface (Fig.3 A). Ntera-2 cells adhered to ADAM-12 and -15 in an α9β1-dependent manner, but required activation by activating anti-β1 mAb TS2/16 (Fig. 3 B). We obtained very similar results with G361 human melanoma cells that also express α9β1 (32Takahashi H. Isobe T. Horibe S. Takagi J. Yokosaki Y. Sheppard D. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23589-23595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); G361 cells adhere to ADAM-12 and -15 in an α9-dependent and activation-dependent manner (data not shown). These results suggest that non-recombinant α9β1 also mediates specific adhesion to ADAM-12 and -15. ADAMs have been implicated in cell-cell interaction during fertilization and myoblast fusion. We studied whether α9β1 interaction with ADAM-15 or ADAM-12 actually supports cell-cell interaction in vitro. We used CHO cells transiently expressing ADAM-15, ADAM-12 (full-length), and truncated ADAM-15 (ADAM-15/PM−), and K562 cells homogeneously expressing α9β1 (α9-K562 cells) (Fig. 4 A) to detect α9β1-ADAM protein interaction. Since monoclonal antibodies against ADAM-15 or ADAM-12 are not readily available, we used the IRES2-EGFP bicistronic vector (29Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Bourget L. Jolicoeur P. Massie B.

Transient EGFP expression was used as a marker of ADAM expression (Fig. 4 B), and typically more than 30% of transfected cells are EGFP-positive. Binding of fluorescence-labeled α9-K562 and parent K562 cells to CHO cells transiently expressing ADAM-15, ADAM-15/PM−, or ADAM-12 was determined. α9-K562 and parent K562 cells bound at low levels (typically 5% of added cells) to control CHO cells that express EGFP but no ADAM (Fig. 4 C). α9-K562 cells bound to cells expressing these ADAMs at significantly higher (approximately 3 times) levels than control parent K562 cells (Fig. 4, C and D). Levels of binding of α9-K562 cells to CHO cells expressing ADAM-12 or ADAM-15 is low (15–20% of added cells) compared with those in other adhesion studies in this study. However, this binding is substantial considering that only approximately 30% of added cells express EGFP and ADAM-12 or -15. Parent K562 cells bound to CHO cells expressing ADAM-15 or -12 at the background levels. Binding of α9-K562 cells to CHO cells expressing ADAM-15 (full-length and truncated) or ADAM-12 was completely blocked by anti-α9 antibody. These results suggest that this interaction is specific to α9β1, and to ADAM-15 or ADAM-12. We studied whether the soluble ADAM disintegrin domains affect ADAM/α9β1-mediated cell-cell interaction. Binding of α9-K562 cells to CHO cells transiently expressing ADAM-12 or -15 was determined in the presence of soluble ADAM-12 or -15 disintegrin domain in the assay medium (Fig.5). The ADAM-15 and -12 disintegrin domain effectively blocked ADAM-12/α9β1-mediated cell-cell interaction (with IC50 of about 0.5 and 0.8 μm, respectively). The ADAM-15 disintegrin domain blocked (with IC50 of about 0.5 μm), but the ADAM-12 disintegrin domain did not significantly block, ADAM-15/α9β1-mediated"

We find that decorin causes a functional inactivation of the oncogenic ErbB2 protein in breast carcinoma cells. Upon de novo expression of decorin, the ErbB2 protein is reduced by ∼40%, whereas its degree of tyrosyl phosphorylation is almost completely abrogated. Both co-culture experiments or experiments with recombinant decorin demonstrate an initial induction of ErbB2 tyrosine kinase, followed by a profound and long-lasting down-regulation of its activity. This leads to growth inhibition and cytodifferentiation of mammary tumor cells and a concurrent suppression of their tumorigenic potential in vivo. These decorin-mediated effects appear to involve the activation of ErbB4, which in turn would block the phosphorylation of heterodimers containing either ErbB2 or ErbB3.

Animals harboring a targeted disruption of decorin and the tumor suppressor p53 exhibit an accelerated rate of death due to invasive thymic lymphomas, suggesting that lack of decorin is permissive for lymphoma tumorigenesis in a mouse model predisposed to cancer (17Iozzo R.V.

Ectopic expression or addition of recombinant decorin induces profound cytostatic effects in a wide variety of transformed cells with diverse histogenetic backgrounds (18Santra M. Mann D.M.

Decorin activates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)1 kinase, thereby triggering a signaling cascade that leads to a sustained phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), mobilization of intracellular calcium, induction of the potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 WAF1/CIP1 , and growth suppression (18Santra M.

Eichstetter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4489-4492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), an interaction that could regulate cell growth at the sites of tissue remodeling and cancer invasion (11Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18843-18846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Currently, there are four known receptors for EGF-like ligands constituting the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (24Hynes N.E. Stern D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar, 25Riese D.J., II Stern D.F. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Whereas EGFR binds many ligands, including EGF, transforming growth factor-α, epiregulin, and amphiregulin, both ErbB3 and ErbB4 bind to a family of proteins collectively known as neuregulins. A related group of molecules, termed NRG 2, binds to the same two receptors, whereas NRG 3 bind only to ErbB4. Betacellulin and heparin EGF-like growth factor binds to ErbB1 and ErbB4 (26Shelly M. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Guarino B.C. Waterman H. Wang L.-W. Lyass L. Alimandi M. Kuo A. Bucas S.S. Pierce J.H. Andrews G.C. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10496-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). ErbB2, the most oncogenic member of the ErbB family, binds none of the EGF-like ligands with high affinity (24Hynes N.E. Stern D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). However, ErbB2 functions as a shared receptor that binds bivalent EGF-like ligands with low affinity, once they are presented by either one of the high affinity receptors (27Tzahar E. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Moyer J.D. Klapper L.N. Alroy I. Levkowitz G. Shelly M. Henis S. Eisenstein N. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Andrews G.C. Yarden Y.

Expression of ErbB2 in the mammary epithelium of transgenic mice induces metastatic disease (29Guy C.T. Webster M.A. Schaller M. Parsons T.J. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10578-10582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar), and amplification/overexpression of ErbB2 is found in approximately 25% of breast cancers and correlates with poor prognosis (30Slamon D.J.

Cancer. 1998; 34: 791-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Notably, overexpression of ErbB2 is sufficient to stimulate breast carcinoma migration and invasion of extracellular matrix (33Spencer K.S.R. Graus-Porta D. Leng J. Hynes N.E. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Owing to its accessible location, ErbB2 is now under intensive scrutiny as a therapeutic target for several types of human tumors (24Hynes N.E. Stern D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). The fact that decorin could affect so many different cell types in which the EGFR could conceivably not be expressed (18Santra M. Mann D.M. Mercer E.W. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) suggested to us that decorin could interact with other members of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinase. We find that de novo expression of decorin leads to a profound inhibition of the steady state levels of ErbB2 phosphorylation in ErbB2-overexpressing breast carcinoma cells. Quantitatively, the overall amount of ErbB2 declines by ∼40% in the three independent clones studied in detail; however, the ErbB2 tyrosyl phosphorylation is nearly completely abolished, as well as that of ErbB3 and ErbB4. Concurrently, the decorin-expressing cells become growth-retarded, with a significant increase in the proportion of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, up-regulate their endogenous levels of p21, undergo in vitrocytodifferentiation, and lose anchorage-independent growth. In addition, the decorin-expressing cells fail to generate orthotopic tumors in nude mice. Co-culture experiments or experiments with recombinant decorin demonstrate an initial induction of ErbB2 tyrosine kinase, followed by a profound and long-lasting down-regulation of its activity. Decorin causes a functional in- activation of the oncogenic ErbB2 by interacting with ErbB4, which in turn would prevent the phosphorylation of heterodimers containing either ErbB2 or ErbB3. These results provide a mechanism by which a naturally occurring protein normally synthesized by fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, the two key components of the tumor stroma, may counteract the growth of neoplastic cells enriched in oncogenic ErbB2. MDA-453 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Recombinant human EGF and the EGF domain of heregulin-α were purchased from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN. The following mouse monoclonal antibodies, all purified by Protein A affinity chromatography (NeoMarkers, Inc., Union City, CA.), were used: anti-EGFR Ab-12 (mixture R19/48), anti-c-erbB2/HER-2/neu Ab-10 (L87+e2–4001), anti-c-erbB3/HER-3 Ab-2 (clone 2F12), and anti-c-erbB4/HER-4 Ab-4. In addition, we used monoclonal antibodies against phosphotyrosine (phosphotyrosine-PY20:HRPO) from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and a rabbit, affinity-purified antiserum raised against the N-terminal peptide of human decorin (34Fisher L.W. Stubbs III, J.T. Young M.F. Acta Orthop. Scand. 1995; 66: 61-65Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Recombinant decorin proteoglycan and decorin core were purified as described before (35Mann D.M.

The full-length human decorin cDNA was ligated at the 3′ end of the human cytomegalovirus early gene promoter and enhancer in a eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA-3.1 (Invitrogen). About 107 MDA-453 human breast carcinoma cells were transfected with 20 μg of decorin expression vector. After 2 days the cells were trypsinized and plated in 100-mm dishes. The following day the cells were cultured with G418 (600 μg/ml) for 4 weeks. Independent colonies were isolated by ring cloning, transferred to microtiter wells, and expanded in 400 μg of G418. Total RNA was extracted with TRI Reagent (Sigma), separated in 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, transferred to nylon membrane, and hybridized with 32P-labeled decorin cDNA by using a multiprime labeling kit (Stratagene). The filter was stripped by boiling with 0.1% SDS in water for 15 min and then hybridized with32P-multiprime-labeled human p21 WAF1/CIP1 cDNA. Cells were grown to 90% confluence and then incubated in serum-free medium for 2 days. Medium was collected and precipitated with five volumes of ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate. The pellets were dried and dissolved in SDS-sample buffer, separated in 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked with 5% dried milk. Membranes were incubated with polyclonal rabbit antibodies against the N-terminal region of decorin for 2 h (34Fisher L.W. Stubbs III, J.T. Young M.F. Acta Orthop. Scand. 1995; 66: 61-65Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Immunodetection was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaF, 200 μmNa3VO4, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors, Complete™ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Following centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 10 min, 1 μg of each antibody/mg of total protein was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Sepharose A/G beads (1:1, v/v) were added and incubated for 1 h with shaking, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and washed three times with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 200 μmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors. The final pellet was boiled in Laemli buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The cells were seeded in 48 wells in the concentration of 105 cells/ml. The cells were incubated with the reagent MTS/PMS CellTiter 96™ aqueous non-radioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega) for 30 min in 37 °C, and color reaction was measured according to the company's protocol. For differentiation assays, tumor cells were plated in multichamber slides (Lab-Tek) and cultured for 4–5 days. The cells were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and stained with Oil Red O to visualize neutral lipids (26Shelly M. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Guarino B.C. Waterman H. Wang L.-W. Lyass L. Alimandi M. Kuo A.

Parallel cultures in multichamber slides were subjected to immunoenzymatic detection of ErbB2 using the monoclonal antibody described above. Bound primary antibody (1:250 dilution) was reacted with unlabeled rabbit anti-mouse bridging antibodies and subsequently with immunocomplexes of alkaline phosphatase and anti-phosphatase monoclonal antibodies. Sections were briefly counterstained with hematoxylin and developed with new fuchsin as the substrate for alkaline phosphatase (37Murdoch A.D. Liu B. Schwarting R. Tuan R.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Two independent clones of MDA-453, clones 4 and 5, were used for in vivo orthotopic tumor growth. Thirty-six female nude (nu/nu) mice (Harlan) were injected with ∼106 cells in the lower left mammary region either alone or in combination with Matrigel, an extracellular matrix extracted from Englebreth-Holm-Swarm tumor (38Kibbey M.C. Grant D.S. Kleinman H.K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 1633-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Tumor development was followed at weekly intervals, and full necropsies were performed on the animals in which tumors developed (17Iozzo R.V. Chakrani F. Perrotti D. McQuillan D.J. Skorski T.

Animals were maintained in accordance to guidelines of the Institution Animal Care and Use Committee. Clone 5, a G418-resistant but decorin-nonexpressing clone, and wild type MDA-453 were cultured in 12-well plates at an initial seeding density of ∼105 cells/dish. Decorin-expressing clones 4 and 13 were cultured in microporous inserts (3 μm) and placed on the top of the MDA-453 and clone 5 cells so that the inserts remained within the medium of the target cells. After 4–6 days of co-culture without changes of the medium, the inserts were removed, and proliferation assays were performed according to the above-mentioned method. For FACS analysis, the cells were trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 70% ethanol, and stained with propidium iodide (2 mg/ml) in 4 mm sodium citrate buffer containing 3% Triton X-100 and RNase A (100 μg/ml). The stained cells were analyzed by FACS as described previously (20Santra M. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Lattime E.C. Iozzo R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7016-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Decorin protein core (10 μg) was labeled to high specific activity (∼9 × 1017cpm/mol) using IODOGEN (Pierce). Confluent cells in multiwell plates (∼106 cells/well) were incubated with increasing concentrations of radiolabeled decorin (5–115 pmol) for ∼2.5 h at 4 °C. The samples were incubated in binding buffer composed of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (39Komurasaki T. Toyoda H. Uchida D. Morimoto S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2841-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation, the cells were extracted in extracting buffer plus various protease inhibitors as described before (40Mongiat M. Taylor K. Otto J. Aho S. Uitto J. Whitelock J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7095-7100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For Scatchard analysis, the cells were exposed to various concentrations of radiolabeled ligand in the presence or absence of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled decorin. Estimates of receptor affinity were achieved with the Wizard program of Sigma Plot 5.0 computer package. To test whether other members of the ErbB gene family could be involved in mediating the effects of decorin, we investigated the human MDA-453 mammary carcinoma cells. These cells lack EGFR (41Yarden Y. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3179-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) but overexpress ErbB2 (42Kraus M.H. Popescu N.C. Amsbaugh S.C. King C.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), and express low levels of ErbB3 (43Alimandi M. Romano A. Curia M.C. Muraro R. Fedi P. Aaronson S.A. Di Fiore P.P. Kraus M.H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1813-1821PubMed Google Scholar) and intermediate levels of ErbB4 (44Plowman G.D. Culouscou J.-M. Whitney G.S. Green J.M. Carlton G.W. Foy L. Neubauer M.G. Shoyab M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1746-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Stably transfected clones, which were resistant to G418 (400 μg/ml) for at least 6 weeks of continuous culture, were screened by Northern blotting using decorin cDNA. We detected three clones, which expressed relatively high decorin mRNA levels (Fig.1 A). In all the decorin-expressing clones, the endogenous levels of p21 were concurrently induced. Clone 5, a clone resistant to G418 but lacking decorin expression, and three decorin-expressing clones (clones 4, 13, and 20) were investigated in detail. Decorin proteoglycan was synthesized and released into the medium conditioned by clones 4, 13, or 20 at roughly equal amounts as visualized by Western immunoblotting with specific anti-decorin antibodies (Fig. 1 B,left panel). Based on comparison with known amounts of recombinant decorin (35Mann D.M. Yamaguchi Y. Bourdon M.A. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we calculated that each decorin-expressing clone synthesizes ∼1.5 μg of decorin/day/106 cells. Notably, all the decorin-expressing clones were markedly growth-inhibited (Fig. 1 C), with the greatest inhibition occurring in clone 4, which expressed the highest levels of decorin, as also demonstrated by anti-decorin immunoblotting of media conditioned by the cells (data not shown). Growth inhibition was time-dependent, and, by day 8, clones 4 and 13 were inhibited by ∼75% and 60%, respectively (Fig. 1 C). The growth of clone 20 was also inhibited by ∼65% (data not shown). The progressive growth inhibition is likely due to the compounding effects of decorin, which accumulates in the medium (6Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). In an independent experiment, the growth of the wild type and clone 5 cells was markedly suppressed by recombinant decorin or decorin core protein (data not shown), in a manner similar to that shown before for colon (20Santra M. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Lattime E.C. Iozzo R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7016-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and squamous (18Santra M. Mann D.M. Mercer E.W. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) carcinoma cells. Finally, FACS analysis revealed a proportional increase in the fraction of the cells in G1phase of the cell cycle with a concurrent decrease of cells in G2 and S phase (Fig. 1 C). These experiments were repeated three times with comparable results. Thus, de novoexpression of decorin causes growth suppression in these breast carcinoma cells overexpressing the oncogene for ErbB2. When the wild type and various clones were investigated for their growth in vitro, interesting morphological changes were observed. Whereas the wild type and clone 5 cells were moderately adherent, all the decorin-expressing clones grew as cohesive monolayers or solid sheets, and displayed a flattened morphology with increased cytoplasm (Fig.2 A). The decorin-expressing clones did not form colonies in soft agar as compared with the wild type or clone 5, which formed aggregates >100 cells after 3 weeks in soft agar (Fig. 2 B). In addition, the decorin-expressing clones showed intense intracytoplasmic deposits of neutral lipids in contrast to the wild type or clone 5 cells (Fig. 2 C). These morphological and phenotypic changes are reminiscent of those observed when the same cells are exposed to epiregulin, a potent pan-ErbB ligand that preferentially activates heterodimeric receptor complexes (26Shelly M. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Guarino B.C. Waterman H. Wang L.-W. Lyass L. Alimandi M. Kuo A. Bucas S.S. Pierce J.H. Andrews G.C. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10496-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Notably, epiregulin can activate not only EGFR, but ErB4 as well, and ErbB2 expression enhances the sensitivity of ErbB4 for activation by epiregulin (45Riese D.J. Komurasaki T. Plowman G.D. Stern D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11288-11294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These results, thus, suggest that decorin may interact with members of the ErbB family other than the EGFR, and that, in doing so, decorin may activate a signaling pathway similar to that activated by epiregulin. To test whether decorin expression would be sufficient to repress orthotopic tumor formation, nu/nu mice were injected with ∼106 cells in the lower left mammary region, either alone or in combination with Matrigel, an extracellular matrix extracted from Englebreth-Holm-Swarm tumor that is known to facilitate tumor take and survival (38Kibbey M.C. Grant D.S. Kleinman H.K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 1633-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Tumor development was followed at weekly intervals, and full necropsies were performed on the animals in which tumors developed (17Iozzo R.V. Chakrani F. Perrotti D. McQuillan D.J. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Eichstetter I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3092-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the absence of Matrigel, none of the animals (n = 20) developed tumors, consistent with the fact that these MDA-453 cells do not form tumors in SCID mice. However, when Matrigel was co-injected with the tumor cells, ∼90% of the animals (n = 8) injected with clone 5 cells developed invasive neoplasms following ∼6-week latency period. The tumors invaded subcutaneous soft tissues and extended into the pelvic cavity (data not shown). In contrast, none of the animals co-injected with the decorin-secreting clone 4 cells (n = 8) generated any tumors, even 4 months following the end point of the experiments. Thus, decorin expression prevents orthotopic breast cancer formation. To investigate the mechanism of action of decorin, we cultured wild type and decorin expressing clones to confluence, rendered them quiescent by overnight incubation in serum-free medium and measured the steady state levels of activated (phosphorylated) ErbB2 receptor with specific monoclonal antibody and Western immunoblotting. The results showed undetectable levels of the phosphorylated 185-kDa band corresponding to ErbB2 in all the decorin expressing clones (Fig.3 A, lanes 3–5, top), while the levels of ErbB2 were only moderately decreased (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3–5, bottom panel), as compared with the either wild type (Fig. 3 A, lane 2) or clone 5 (data not shown). These experiments were repeated five times, and consistently the steady state levels of ErbB2 in the decorin-expressing clones were reduced to 45 ± 9% of control levels. Only after longer exposures was it possible to visualize low amounts of phosphorylated ErbB2. As a control, we used A431 squamous carcinoma cells that overexpress EGFR. As expected, a band of ∼170 kDa, migrating slightly faster than ErbB2, was observed in A431 cell extracts (Fig. 3 A, lane 1,top); this band was confirmed to be EGFR by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies against the EGFR (data not shown). Only after long exposure, a small amount of ErbB2 was also detected in the A431 cells (data not shown). Thus, decorin causes a reduction of ErbB2 and an even greater suppression of its tyrosyl phosphorylation. Because the inhibition of ErbB phosphorylation could conceivably be due to a decorin-mediated activation of a phosphatase, cells were exposed for 2 h to increasing concentrations of sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), a potent inhibitor of phosphotyrosine phosphatase (46Gordon J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). No significant changes were observed at all concentrations of orthovanadate (Fig. 3 B). In agreement with the data shown above, the phosphorylation of ErbB2 was totally abolished in clones 4, 13, and 20 (the decorin-expressing clones), but was fully maintained in clone 5 or wild type cells (data not shown), even at high concentrations (100 μm) of orthovanadate. Immunohistochemical evaluation of the various clones using the monoclonal anti-ErbB2 antibody confirmed the Western immunoblotting data. The amount of ErbB2 was reduced in all the decorin-expressing cells. The difference was accentuated by the fact that the decorin-expressing cells are larger in size and thus the antigen appears more diffuse (Fig. 3 C). Because we detected no other phosphorylated band between 160 and 180 kDa (Fig. 3 A), corresponding to either ErbB3 and ErbB4, respectively, it is likely that these two ErbB members are also down-r"

Both represented insertions in the same gene, namedPHG1. This gene encodes a polytopic membrane protein with an N-terminal lumenal domain and nine potential transmembrane segments. Homologous genes can be identified in many species; however, their function is yet to be elucidated. Disruption of PHG1 caused a selective defect in phagocytosis of latex beads and Escherichia coli, but not Klebsiella aerogenes bacteria. This defect in phagocytosis was caused by a decrease in the adhesion of mutant cells to phagocytosed particles. These results indicate that the Phg1 protein is involved in the adhesion of Dictyosteliumto various substrates, a crucial event of phagocytosis and demonstrate the usefulness of a genetic approach to dissect the molecular events involved in the phagocytic process.

In higher eucaryotes, phagocytic cells are essential players of the host defense against invading pathogens and tissue remodeling (for review see Ref. 1Brown E.J. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Phagocytosis involves adhesion of the phagocytic cell to the particle, and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton to allow engulfment. A number of receptors required for the recognition of particles to be phagocytosed have been identified in mammalian cells,e.g. Fc receptors involved in the phagocytosis of opsonized particles (2Daëron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). These receptors presumably transduce a local activation signal upon recognition of their ligand, leading to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Protein kinases such as Syk (3Kiefer F. Brumell J. Al-Alawi N. Latour S. Cheng A. Veillette A. Ginstein S. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4209-4220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family (4Massol P. Montcourrier P. Guillemot J.C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6219-6229Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) have been implicated in the transduction of the activation signal. The cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum has been used previously as a model organism to study phagocytosis (5Vogel G. Thilo L. Schwarz H. Steinhart R. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 6Cohen C.J. Bacon R. Clarke M. Joiner K. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Vegetative Dictyostelium amoebae multiply as single cells feeding phagocytically on bacteria. The mechanisms involved in phagocytosis by Dictyostelium cells are very similar to those used by mammalian phagocytes, and involve notably the actin cytoskeleton and RacF1, a member of the Rho family of GTP-binding proteins (7Rivero F. Albrecht R. Dislich H. Bracco E. Gaciotti L. Bozzaro S. Noegel A.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1205-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The receptors responsible for phagocytosis have not yet been identified. However, previous studies suggest that there are at least two receptors, one a lectin and the other one a “nonspecific” receptor, which accounts for the phagocytosis of most hydrophilic particles in HL5 medium (5Vogel G. Thilo L. Schwarz H. Steinhart R. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Here we describe the identification of a new gene implicated in phagocytosis in Dictyostelium. The phenotype of thephg1 mutants suggests a role for Phg1p in adhesion to phagocytic substrates. Wild-type cells used in this study are DH1–10 cells, a subclone of DH1 cells. They were grown at 21 °C in HL5 medium (8Cornillon S. Foa C. Davoust J. Buonavista N. Gross J.D. Golstein P. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2691-2704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subcultured twice a week. Cells were typically not allowed to reach a density of more than 2 × 106 cells/ml. To obtain rhodamine-labeled bacteria, an overnight culture was centrifuged and resuspended in PBS.1 Bacteria were boiled 30 min in a water bath under mild stirring conditions, and then washed four times with PBS and once with SB (2 mmNa2HPO4, 14.7 mmKH2PO4, pH 6.0). Cells were then resuspended in a solution of 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 9.2, 5 mg of rhodamine-isothiocyanate (ICN Biomedicals Inc.) at 2 × 109 cells/ml and incubated for 30 min under mild agitation. They were then washed twice in SB plus 40 mmNH4Cl, twice in SB, and frozen in aliquots. To assess internalization, 105 cells were transferred in 1 ml of fresh HL5 medium containing: 1 μl of 1 μm diameter Fluoresbrite YG carboxylate microspheres (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA), or 0.5 mg/ml FITC-dextran (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), or 5 × 107 rhodamine-labeled bacteria. The cells were incubated with or without shaking (200 rpm) for 1 h, then washed twice with ice-cold HL5 and analyzed using a fluorescence spectrofluorometer (FACSCalibur, Beckton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Cells were transformed with the pUCBsrΔBamHI vector by the restriction enzyme-mediated integration procedure essentially as described (9Cornillon S. Olie R.A. Golstein P. Cell Death Diff. 1998; 5: 416-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Adachi H. Hasebe T. Yoshinaga K. Ohta T. Sutoh K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 205: 1808-1814Google Scholar, 11Kuspa A. Loomis W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8803-8807Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed once in sterile ice-cold electroporation buffer (10 mm NaPO4, pH 6.1, 50 mmsucrose), mixed with 10 μg of BamHI-linearized vector and 10 units of DpnII restriction enzyme and electroporated using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (0.4-cm cuvettes, 1 kV, 3 microfarads), and then resuspended in 30 ml of HL5 medium. Blasticidin S hydrochloride (10 μg/ml; ICN Biomedicals Inc., Aurora, OH) was added 24 h later. After 10 days of selection, cells were grouped into five pools, incubated with fluorescent latex beads in HL5 medium for 1 h, and the cells having phagocytosed no beads were sorted in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS; FACSstar plus). Cells were subjected to a second round of selection 7 days later and cloned in 96-well plates after the FACS. Finally, individual clones were retested for their ability to phagocytose fluorescent latex beads. Forty-seven individual clones were identified as deficient for phagocytosis. Three of them corresponded to phg1-1 mutants, and one to aphg1-2 mutant. Genomic DNA was extracted as described (12Chang W.-T. Gross J.D. Newell P.C. Plasmid. 1995; 34: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), digested with various enzymes, and analyzed by Southern blot as described previously (9Cornillon S. Olie R.A. Golstein P. Cell Death Diff. 1998; 5: 416-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), using radiolabeled pUCBsrΔBamHI as a probe. Genomic DNA from phg1 mutants (4 μg) was digested withClaI, precipitated, and resuspended in 100 μl of distilled H2O. Fifteen microliters of DNA were then ligated overnight at 16 °C in a final volume of 100 μl, in the presence of 400 units of ligase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Ligation products were precipitated and used to transform DH10B bacteria by electroporation. Plasmids recovered by plasmid rescue of phg1 mutants (10 μg) were linearized with ClaI and electroporated into DH1–10 cells (see above). After blasticidin selection, insertion of plasmid at the homologous site in the genome was confirmed by Southern blot. Disruption mutants thus obtained were used for all the experiments. A cDNA encoding Phg1 protein (SSL630) was obtained from theDictyostelium cDNA project in Japan (13Morio T. Urushihara H. Saito T. Ugawa Y. Mizuno H. Yoshida M. Yoshino R. Mitra B.N. Pi M. Sato T. Takemoto K. Yasukawa H. Williams J. Maeda M. Takeuchi I. Ochiai H. Tanaka Y. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pDAX-3C expression vector (D. Manstein, Max Planck Institute for Medical Research, Heidelberg, Germany) (14Manstein D. Schuster H.-P. Morandini P. Hunt D.M. Gene (Amst. ). 1995; 162: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) to obtain the pSC3A vector, used to complement phg1 mutants. The cell detachment assay was adapted from Cozens-Roberts et al. (15Cozens-Roberts C. Quinn J.A. Lauffenberger D.A. Biophys. J. 1990; 58: 107-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The technical details will be described in a separate publication. 2E. Décavé, F. Brückert, Y. Bréchet, B. Fourcade, and M. Satre, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, cells were spread evenly on a glass plate and allowed to settle for 15 min in the indicated buffer. A flat stainless steel disc pierced in its center was placed above. Medium was flowed at a constant rate for 5 min through the central orifice of the disc, before removal of the disc and microscopic examination of the remaining cells. The radius at which 50% of the cells were detached was determined (r 50%), and the stress at this distance to the center was ς50% = 3Dη/πe 2 r 50%, where D is the flow rate, e the distance between the plate and the disc (0.21 mm for experiments in SB buffer, 0.56 in HL5 buffer), and η the fluid viscosity (10−3Pa·s). To visualize adherent cells by scanning electron microscopy, cells were seeded in HL5 medium at low density on sterile glass coverslips and allowed to grow for 3 days. The coverslips were transferred delicately to HL5 containing 1% glutaraldehyde, and fixed for 30 min at room temperature. They were then rinsed with PBS and dehydrated by successive 10-min incubations with increasing concentrations of ethanol (30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100%). Dehydrated cells were vacuum-coated with gold and photographed with a Siemens Autoscan scanning microscope. Cells were washed once in PBS, resuspended at 106 cells/20 μl in sample buffer (0.103 g/ml sucrose, 5 × 10−2mTris, pH 6.8, 5 × 10−3mEDTA, 0.5 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 2% SDS), and 20 μl of each sample were run on a 9% acrylamide gel in nonreducing conditions. The gel was then transferred onto a nitrocellulose BA 85 membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The membrane was incubated sequentially with an antipeptide antiserum (YC1, 1/300) directed to a sequence in the lumenal domain of the Phg1 protein (YKKVENWKGDTGDDC), and with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed, and revealed by ECL. Monoclonal antibody to protein-disulfide isomerase (221-135-1) was a kind gift of M. Maniak (16Monnat J. Hacker H. Geissler H. Rauchenberger R. Neuhaus E.M. Maniak M. Soldati T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Approximately 7 × 108 exponentially growing cells were allowed to internalize latex beads for 90 min in HL5 medium, washed twice with HL5 and once with ice-cold homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 5 mm Hepes, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were resuspended in 2 ml of homogenization buffer, and disrupted by 25 passages in a ball-bearing cell cracker. Intact cells were removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 rpm, and the phagosomal fraction was isolated as already described by flotation on a sucrose step gradient (17Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The phagosomal fraction was collected at the interface of the 10% and 25% sucrose solutions, and submitted to a second round of flotation, a procedure that was found to reduce significantly the contamination by non-phagosomal markers. The phagosomal membranes were finally diluted with PBS and pelleted by centrifugation. Total protein content was tested by Micro BCA protein assay (Pierce) in the cellular lysate and in the purified phagosomal fraction, and equivalent amounts of proteins (300 ng) were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by Western blot as described above. The isolation of mutants defective for phagocytosis followed the classical method for the generation of mutants by restriction enzyme-mediated integration (11Kuspa A. Loomis W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8803-8807Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Briefly, a plasmid containing a selectable marker (resistance to blasticidin) was introduced into cells by electroporation together with the DpnII restriction enzyme. This resulted in random integration of the plasmid at one of the manyDpnII sites present in the genome ofDictyostelium. The blasticidin-resistant cells were then incubated for 1 h in the presence of fluorescent latex beads and washed, and nonfluorescent cells were sorted with a FACS. The procedure was repeated 1 week later, and the negative cells cloned into individual wells. The resulting clones were then individually tested, and those found to be defective for phagocytosis were identified. One of these clones represented an insertion in the myosin VII gene, a gene recently reported to be implicated in phagocytosis (18Titus M.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1297-1303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Two other clones (phg1-1 and phg1-2) were selected for further analysis. Digestion of the genomic DNA of these two clones with ClaI yielded an identical plasmid-containing fragment of approximately 9 kilobase pairs (data not shown). Genomic DNA digested withClaI was allowed to recircularize, then introduced into bacteria. This resulted in the selection of bacteria containing the original plasmid with the flanking sequences of the integration site. Upon sequencing, the two clones were found to represent distinct insertions in the same gene, named PHG1 (Fig.1 A). To ascertain that the observed phenotype was caused solely by the insertion in thePHG1 gene, plasmids corresponding to the phg1-1and phg1-2 insertions were used for targeted gene inactivation in wild-type cells. In both cases the insertion of the plasmid in PHG1 gave rise to a strain with a strong defect in phagocytosis. The genomic DNA of PHG1 was sequenced, as well as a full-length cDNA clone recovered from theDictyostelium cDNA library (SSL630; Ref. 13Morio T. Urushihara H. Saito T. Ugawa Y. Mizuno H. Yoshida M. Yoshino R. Mitra B.N. Pi M. Sato T. Takemoto K. Yasukawa H. Williams J. Maeda M. Takeuchi I. Ochiai H. Tanaka Y. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The Phg1 protein (642 amino acid residues) exhibits a potential N-terminal signal sequence followed by a lumenal domain and nine potential membrane-spanning segments (Fig. 1 C). The alignment of the Phg1 protein with its closest homologue in human (KIAA0255 =D87444) is shown in Fig. 1 B. Numerous genes previously sequenced in other species show a high homology to the PHG1 gene. All of them exhibit a similar overall structure, with a rather variable potential lumenal domain followed by a more conserved membrane domain with nine putative transmembrane domains. Three homologues of PHG1 have been fully sequenced in human (D87444 = KIAA0255, U81006 and U94831; Refs. 19Chluba-de Tapia J. de Tapia M. Jäggin V. Eberle A.N. Gene (Amst. ). 1997; 197: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar and 20Schimmöler F. Diaz E. Mühlbauer B. Pfeffer S.R. Gene (Amst. ). 1998; 216: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), three in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (U53880,Z48758, U18916), two in Caenorhabditis elegans (Z79759,AF026213) and three in Arabidopsis thaliana (AC005967,AC006532, U95973). Expressed sequence tag data bases also reveal additional related genes in Dictyostelium and human, and homologues in other species (Drosophila melanogaster,Mus musculus). No function has been determined for any of these previously sequenced genes. On the basis of their primary structure, they have been named 9TM proteins. In wild-type cells, the Phg1 protein migrates at an apparent molecular mass of approximately 65 kDa, as observed by immunoblot of a cellular lysate with an antiserum directed to the Phg1 protein (Fig.2 A). In phg1 mutant cells, disruption of the PHG1 gene leads to the production of small amounts of a truncated, presumably nonfunctional protein (Fig.2 A). We introduced into these cells a vector expressingPHG1 under the control of a constitutive promoter. This resulted in wild-type levels of expression of Phg1 protein (Fig.2 A) and concomitantly restored the ability of the cells to phagocytose fluorescent latex beads (Fig. 2 B). Together, these results indicate that a loss of function of the Phg1 protein leads to a defect in the phagocytic process inDictyostelium. To determine more precisely the nature of the internalization defect inphg1 mutants, we tested the ability of the mutant cells to internalize various types of particles. As seen during the isolation of the mutants, phg1 mutant cells exhibited a strong inability to phagocytose latex beads (Fig.3 A). On the contrary, the internalization of the fluid phase markers FITC-dextran (Fig.3 B) or lucifer yellow (data not shown) was comparable to that of wild-type cells. Interestingly, although a significant phagocytosis defect was observed for E. coli, phagocytosis of Klebsiella aerogenes bacteria was much less affected (Fig. 3 C). Phagocytosis of various bacteria byphg1 cells showed that the defect was minor only forK. aerogenes and K. aerogenes KP21 (25Favre-Bonte S. Joly B. Forestier C. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 554-561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (80.1% and 48.0% percentage of internalization, respectively, compared with 10.4%, 12.1%, 10.5%, 15.3%, and 28.8% for E. coli,Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila,Salmonella typhimurium, and Streptococcus bovis, respectively). Previous publications have indicated that the (unidentified) receptor responsible for phagocytosis of most substrates in HL5 medium is not necessary for phagocytosis in phosphate buffer (SB) (see “Discussion”). When phagocytosis experiments were performed in SB medium, very little defect was observed for phg1 cells (34%, 24%, and 37% decrease for the phagocytosis of latex beads,K. aerogenes, and E. coli, respectively, compared with wild-type cells). Fluid phase uptake occurs essentially by macropinocytosis in Dictyostelium (21Hacker U. Albrecht R. Maniak M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 105-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a process involving the actin cytoskeleton in a manner similar to phagocytosis. The fact that fluid phase uptake was not affected in phg1 mutant cells suggested that the basic machinery responsible for formation of endocytic vacuoles was intact in these cells. The inability of the mutant cells to adhere to certain phagocytic substrates could be responsible for this selective phenotype. It has been previously shown that talin mutants defective for adhesion exhibit an enhanced defect in phagocytosis when the suspension of cells and particles is shaken (22Niewöhner J. Weber I. Maniak M. Müller-Taubenberger A. Gerisch G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, adhesion of the cell to the particle is even more crucial for phagocytosis of particles in a shaken suspension. This also appeared to be the case for phg1 mutants (Fig. 3 C). This result suggests that the phenotype of phg1 cells could primarily be manifested in the adhesion properties of mutant cells. Whereas wild-type cells in culture adhered efficiently to the surface of the culture plate, phg1 mutant cells were often observed floating in the medium, suggesting that they exhibit reduced adherence to the substrate (data not shown). To quantitate this, the cells were allowed to adhere to a glass plate, and the hydrodynamic stress necessary to detach 50% of the cells was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The adhesion of phg1 mutant cells in HL5 was markedly decreased compared with wild-type cells, as revealed by the smaller value of the hydrodynamic stress measured forphg1 cells (<0.025 Pa) compared with wild-type cells (0.5 ± 0.1 Pa). In SB medium, phg1 cells did not show a reduced adherence to the substrate according to the similar hydrodynamic stress values measured for wild-type and phg1cells (2.5 ± 0.2 and 2.4 ± 0.6 Pa, respectively). Upon more prolonged culture in HL5 medium, phg1 mutant cells did adhere to their substrate. However, examination of the cells by scanning electron microscopy revealed distinct differences between adherent wild-type and mutant cells. Whereas wild-type cells adhered tightly to the glass coverslip, phg1 cells did not spread as extensively and could be seen to detach locally from the substrate (Fig. 4). Together, these results indicate that the primary defect ofphg1 mutant cells is a decrease in their adhesion capacity. The implication of the Phg1 protein in the early steps of phagocytosis suggests that it should be present at the cell surface and in the phagocytic compartments. Previous publications suggest that other members of the family might be present in the endocytic pathway (20Schimmöler F. Diaz E. Mühlbauer B. Pfeffer S.R. Gene (Amst. ). 1998; 216: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Singer-Krüger B. Frank R. Crausaz F. Riezman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14376-14386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, all the antisera generated in our laboratory only recognized the denatured Phg1 protein onto nitrocellulose and did not allow us to assay the presence of Phg1 at the cell surface by immunofluorescence or immunoprecipitation. The abundance of naturally biotinylated proteins in Dictyostelium cells also prevented the isolation of surface proteins by surface biotinylation followed by adsorption to avidin (24Lydan M.A. O'Day D.H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1991; 174: 990-994Google Scholar). To test for the presence of the Phg1 protein in phagosomes, we allowed cells to phagocytose latex beads and purified phagosomes by flotation on a sucrose gradient as described previously (17Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The purified phagosomal fractions contained only minor amounts of protein-disulfide isomerase, a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum, in contrast to high amounts of Phg1 protein (Fig.5). The presence of the Phg1 protein in the phagosomal pathway is compatible with a role in adhesion to phagocytosed particles. Our work allowed the identification of Phg1p, a protein essential for adhesion to and phagocytosis of a range of substrates. How does inactivation of PHG1 result in decreased adhesiveness of mutant cells? The fact that phagocytosis of various particles is affected differentially in phg1 mutant cells suggests some element of specificity in the function of the Phg1 protein, namely that Phg1 might act as a receptor for the phagocytosis of certain substrates (latex beads, E. coli). The presence of Phg1 in the phagocytic pathway is compatible with this hypothesis. Previous publications (5Vogel G. Thilo L. Schwarz H. Steinhart R. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) have indicated that in HL5 medium a so-called nonspecific receptor is responsible for the phagocytosis of most particles. This work is based on the analysis of a mutant very similar to the phg1 mutants described here, but the corresponding gene could not be identified. In a series of very elegant experiments, it was shown that this receptor recognizes highly hydrophilic particles: bacteria or latex beads coated with HL5 components. In phosphate buffer (SB), the situation is radically different. The very hydrophobic surface of noncoated latex beads ensures their binding to cells and their phagocytosis in a receptor-independent manner. An additional (unidentified) lectin-type receptor can also operate in SB medium. In HL5 medium the lectin is inhibited by the maltose present in the medium, while in SB it ensures the phagocytosis of bacteria. Thus phagocytosis of latex beads as well as bacteria is dependent on the nonspecific receptor in HL5 medium, but not in SB medium. Strikingly, both the phagocytosis and the adhesion defect ofphg1 mutants are observed in HL5 medium, but not in phosphate (SB) medium. It is tempting to speculate that Phg1p might be the previously described nonspecific receptor ofDictyostelium, necessary for phagocytosis of a range of hydrophilic substrates in HL5 medium (5Vogel G. Thilo L. Schwarz H. Steinhart R. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In this view, Phg1 proteins could constitute a family of receptors with a variable extracellular domain involved in recognition of various substrates, while the conserved membrane domain would ensure interaction with cellular components. However, other interpretations are compatible with our observations. In particular, Phg1 protein(s) might act as a modulator of another as yet unidentified receptor, either by regulating its adhesive properties, or by controlling its surface expression. The genetic approach described in this study allows random isolation and functional characterization of new genes involved in the phagocytic process. In the future, it will hopefully allow a more systematic dissection of the molecular events involved at different stages of the phagocytic process.

Basal levels of S1P in cells are generally low but can increase rapidly when cells are exposed to various agonists through rapid and transient activation of SK activity. To date, elucidation of the exact signaling pathways affected by these elevated S1P levels has relied on the use of SK inhibitors that are known to have direct effects on other enzymes in the cell. Furthermore, these inhibitors block basal SK activity, which is thought to have a housekeeping function in the cell. To produce a specific inhibitor of SK activation we sought to generate a catalytically inactive, dominant-negative SK. This was accomplished by site-directed mutagenesis of Gly82 to Asp of the human SK, a residue identified through sequence similarity to the putative catalytic domain of diacylglycerol kinase. This mutant had no detectable SK activity when expressed at high levels in HEK293T cells. Activation of endogenous SK activity by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interleukin-1β, and phorbol esters in HEK293T cells was blocked by expression of this inactive sphingosine kinase (hSKG82D). Basal SK activity was unaffected by expression of hSKG82D. Expression of hSKG82D had no effect on TNFα-induced activation of protein kinase C and sphingomyelinase activities. Thus, hSKG82D acts as a specific dominant-negative SK to block SK activation. This discovery provides a powerful tool for the elucidation of the exact signaling pathways affected by elevated S1P levels following SK activation. To this end we have employed the dominant-negative SK to demonstrate that TNFα activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1,2) is dependent on SK activation.

Stimulation of SK activity by these agonists results in rapid and transient increases in cellular S1P, the basal levels of which are generally low (2Spiegel S. Culliver O. Edsall L.C. Kohama T.

Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar), triggering the downstream pathways described earlier. Although cell agonists stimulate SK activity, there is considerable basal activity found in unstimulated cells. We have previously suggested this may represent dual roles for SK in the cell (23Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Vandeleur L. Moretti P.A.B. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. Biochem.

In contrast, the higher levels of SK activity seen upon cell stimulation with various cell agonists appear to confer cell signaling roles for this enzyme through the production of S1P (1Spiegel S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar,2Spiegel S. Culliver O. Edsall L.C. Kohama T. Menzeleev R. Olah Z. Olivera A. Pirianov G. Thomas D.M. Tu Z.

To date, studying the roles of agonist-induced SK activation and the resultant elevated S1P levels in cell signaling has relied upon the use of SK inhibitors to decrease S1P formation in response to agonist stimulation of cells, as well as the addition of endogenous S1P in these conditions to resurrect S1P-mediated signaling. This system, although providing useful insights into the roles of SK activation and S1P, is not ideal. Three main inhibitors of sphingosine kinase are known, N,N-dimethylsphingosine,N,N,N-trimethylsphingosine, anddl-threo-dihydrosphingosine (23Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Vandeleur L. Moretti P.A.B.

Although these inhibitors have been used extensively in studies examining the role of S1P and SK, unfortunately they do not show absolute specificity to SK. Instead, they appear to have secondary effects on the cell, including inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) (26Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. Toyokuni T Dean B. Fujita S. Sugimoto M. Ogawa T. El-Ghendy K.

(Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 1080-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Additionally, their use inhibits basal (housekeeping) SK activity in cells, inevitably leading to increases in cellular sphingosine and ceramide levels and resulting in modulation of signaling pathways affected by these molecules (3Igarashi Y.

To add further complexity, the addition of endogenous S1P to cells not only resurrects intracellular signaling functions of S1P but also triggers numerous other pathways leading from the recently identified EDG family of G protein-coupled S1P-specific cell surface receptors, of which four isoforms are known (31Lee M.-J.

This has made interpretation of the exact roles of S1P in cell signaling difficult. In this study we have overcome the problems associated with the use of these SK inhibitors and addition of exogenous S1P by the development of a dominant-negative SK that specifically blocks SK activation, while leaving the relatively high basal SK activity unaltered. d-erythro-Sphingosine and S1P were purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories Inc.

Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T, ATCC CRL-1573) were cultured on Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (CSL Biosciences, Parkville, Australia) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 0.2% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate, 1.2 mg/ml penicillin, and 1.6 mg/ml gentamycin. Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (35Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 54: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). High transfection efficiency (>90%) of these cells was confirmed using immunofluorescence with the M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) and fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse Ig (Selinus/Amrad, Melbourne, Australia). Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication (2 watts for 30 s at 4 °C) in lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris/HCl (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmEDTA, and protease inhibitors (CompleteTM; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein concentrations in cell homogenates were determined with either the Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma) or bicinchoninic acid (Pierce) reagents using bovine serum albumin as standard. Human SK1 (hSK) cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AF200328) was FLAG epitope-tagged at the 3′ end and subcloned into pcDNA3 vector, as described previously (23Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Vandeleur L.

For coexpression experiments hSK cDNA was hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged at the 3′ end by PfuDNA polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide primers 5′-TTGAACCATTATGCTGGCTATGA-3′ and 5′-TATCTAGAAGCTTAGGCGTAGTCTGGCACGTCGTATGGGTATAAGGGCTCTTCTGGCGGT-3′. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested withApaI-XbaI, and the resultant HA-tagged hSK cassette was subcloned to generate pGEM4Z-hSK-HA. The HA-tagged hSK cDNA was then cloned into pcDNA3 by digestion withEcoRI-XbaI. Sequencing verified the integrity of the cDNA sequence. The FLAG-tagged hSK cDNA (23Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Vandeleur L. Moretti P.A.B. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) was cloned into pALTER (Promega Inc., Madison, WI) site-directed mutagenesis vector. Single-stranded DNA was prepared and used as a template for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis as detailed in the manufacturer's protocol. The mutagenic oligonucleotide (5′-CTGGAGACGATCTGATGCAC-3′) was designed to generate the hSKG82D mutant by substitution of the Gly82 to Asp. The mutant was sequenced to verify incorporation of the desired modification. The hSKG82Dmutant cDNA was then subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA) for transient transfection into HEK293T cells. SK activity was determined usingd-erythro-sphingosine and [γ-32P]ATP as substrates, as described previously (23Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Vandeleur L. Moretti P.A.B. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Neutral sphingomyelinase activity was determined using [choline-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin as substrate, essentially as described previously (36Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell lysates, prepared as described above, were added to an equal volume of 100 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, and [choline-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (50,000 cpm/assay) and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Radioactive phosphorylcholine produced was then extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and quantified in the aqueous phase by scintillation counting. The measurement of PKC activity in situ was performed as described previously (37Xia P. Aiello L.P. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Park D.J. Robinson G.S. Takagi H. Newsome W.P. Jirousek M.R. King G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded in 24-well plates and maintained in culture medium until 70–80% confluent. After the indicated treatments, the cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and placed in 60 μl of buffered salt solution (137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.3 mm Na2HPO4, 0.4 mmKH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES) supplemented with 50 μg/ml digitonin, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 10 μm[γ-32P]ATP (5000 cpm/pmol). A PKC-specific peptide substrate (RKRTLRRL) was then added (to 200 μm) in the presence of 5 mm EGTA and 2.5 mmCaCl2. After a 10-min incubation at 30 °C, the kinase reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Aliquots (65 μl) of the acidified reaction mixtures were spotted on phosphocellulose papers (Whatman P-81) and washed three times with 75 mm phosphoric acid and once with 75 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The PKC-dependent phosphorylated peptide substrate bound to the filter was quantified by scintillation counting. Relative cellular S1P levels following TNFα treatment were determined after a 4-h preincubation of cells in serum and phosphate-free medium containing 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested and lysed in 300 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors (CompleteTM; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lipids were then extracted with 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol,1 m NaCl (2:2:1, v/v) containing 50 μl of 3 m NaOH. Under these alkaline conditions S1P is water-soluble and partitions to the aqueous phase. The aqueous phase was then collected, acidified by the addition of 25 μl of concentrated HCl, and extracted with 1.2 ml of chloroform/methanol/concentrated HCl (100:100:1, v/v) to partition S1P to the organic phase. [32P]S1P in the organic phase was then isolated by TLC on Silica Gel 60 with 1-butanol/ethanol/acetic acid/water (8:2:1:2, v/v) and quantitated by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on cell lysates according to the method of Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207852) Google Scholar) using 12% acrylamide gels. Proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose, and the membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 5% skim milk and 0.1% Triton X-100. SK expression levels were analyzed with either a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5) or M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). ERK activation in response to agonists was followed in cells serum-starved for 4 h using anti-ERK1,2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) and anti-phospho-ERK1,2 (Promega, Madison, WI) antibodies. Immunocomplexes were detected after conjugation to either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (Pierce) or anti-rabbit (Selinus/Amrad, Melbourne, Australia) IgG using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We have recently cloned and characterized hSK (23Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Vandeleur L. Moretti P.A.B. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A search of the hSK amino acid sequence for signaling domains using the SMART search tool (39Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3037) Google Scholar, 40Ponting C.P. Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) revealed similarity in residues 16–153 to the putative catalytic domain of diacylglycerol kinases (DGK). hSK showed an overall 36% identity to the consensus sequence of the DGK catalytic domain family and possessed 17 of the 24 very highly conserved amino acids of this domain (Fig.1). One region of the hSK sequence showing highest similarity corresponded to the proposed ATP binding site of the DGK catalytic domain (47Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This region in DGK displays some resemblance to the glycine-rich loop within the ATP binding site of many protein kinases (48Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3837) Google Scholar, 49Benner S.A. Gerloff D. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1992; 31: 121-181Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar) but is more divergent in hSK. A glycine residue in this region is known to be essential for DGK catalytic activity because mutation of this residue to aspartate ablates activity in all DGKs examined (41Masai I. Okazaki A. Hosoya T. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11157-11161Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 47Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Therefore, in an attempt to produce a catalytically inactive hSK, we also mutated the corresponding glycine (Gly82) to aspartate in hSK. We then expressed this hSKG82D, as well as the wild-type hSK (hSKWT), in HEK293T cells and assayed the cell lysates for SK activity (Fig.2). As previously reported (23Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Vandeleur L. Moretti P.A.B. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), expression of hSKWT produces a substantial (approximately 2000-fold) increase in SK activity over the endogenous levels. In contrast, similar expression of hSKG82D produced no detectable increase in SK activity. This demonstrated that, as for DGKs, the Gly82 to Asp mutation ablated catalytic activity in hSK and due to its similarity to the glycine-rich loop of protein kinases, may suggest that this region of the enzyme is involved in ATP binding.Figure 1Sequence alignment of the putative catalytic domains of some diacylglycerol kinases with sphingosine kinases.The putative DGK catalytic domains of Drosophila DGK2 (41Masai I.

Therefore, we tested whether hSKG82D could act in a similar manner to block endogenous SK activation by various cell agonists in HEK293T cells. Cells were transiently transfected with either pcDNA3-hSKG82D or empty vector, and the SK activity was determined in response to treatment with TNFα, IL-1, and PMA. As observed previously (4Xia P.

Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), TNFα and PMA stimulated endogenous SK activity approximately 2-fold in the empty vector transfected HEK293T cells (Fig. 3). Similar stimulation of SK activity was also observed in these cells with IL-1 (Fig. 3). However, strikingly, in cells expressing hSKG82D no activation of endogenous SK activity was observed in response to either TNFα or IL-1, whereas PMA treatment resulted in only a small increase in SK activity (Fig. 3). Basal levels of SK activity were maintained in both unstimulated and stimulated cells in the presence of hSKG82D. Further examination of the time course of TNFα stimulation (Fig. 4) showed that expression of hSKG82D blocked activation of SK activity even after an extended period of stimulation. SK activity was maintained at unstimulated levels, demonstrating that hSKG82D blocks activation but not basal SK activity. Cellular S1P levels were also measured in parallel with SK activity. As predicted, cells expressing hSKG82D showed no transient increase in S1P levels in response to TNFα, while basal S1P levels were maintained. It is especially notable that hSKG82D does not reduce S1P levels in either unstimulated or stimulated cells. This demonstrates that, in the intact cell, hSKG82D does not block S1P formation by sequestering substrate, which would reduce both basal and stimulated S1P levels. This effect would be missed inin vitro SK assays where substrate is in excess but theoretically could be important in cells where substrate could be limiting. Also of note was that the time course for increased S1P levels occurs at a slightly earlier stage than that for SK activity. This may be due to increased S1P lyase (11Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12502-12507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or S1P phosphatase (12Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Galve-Roperh I. Poulton S. Peterson C. Olivera A.

A. 2000; 97: 7859-7864Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) activity, clearing the cell of S1P, although currently nothing is known regarding the regulation of these enzymes. Combined, these data indicate that hSKG82D indeed acts as a dominant-negative SK (dnSK) in ablating activation of endogenous SK activity. To establish the specificity of hSKG82D as a dominant-negative for SK activation, we examined other pathways stimulated by TNFα that should not be affected by hSKG82D. Previous studies have shown that both sphingomyelinase (36Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 54Lawler J.F. Yin M. Diehl A.M. Roberts E. Chatterjee S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25099-25104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) activity are stimulated by TNFα. Therefore, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with either pcDNA3-hSKG82D or empty vector, and the sphingomyelinase and PKC activity was determined in response to treatment with TNFα. Activation of both enzymes by TNFα was unaffected by the presence of hSKG82D (Fig.5). This illustrates that hSKG82D is a specific dominant-negative for SK activation by TNFα, blocking that activation and not other TNFα signaling pathways. We have previously shown that TNFα can rapidly induce an approximate 2-fold increase in the already high levels of SK activity resulting from the overexpression of hSKWT in HEK293T cells in a parallel manner to the activation of endogenous SK activity (23Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Vandeleur L. Moretti P.A.B. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Similar results were also recently reported with platelet-derived growth factor stimulation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressing a murine SK (56Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the ability of hSKG82D to block the activation of these high levels of hSKWT (2000-fold overexpression) by following TNFα-induced stimulation of SK activity in HEK293T cells coexpressing hSKWT and hSKG82D. To confirm similar levels of expression, the two SK forms were constructed with different epitope tags. The presence of equimolar levels of hSKG82D blocked TNFα stimulation of hSKWTactivity by approximately 50% (Fig. 6). The high basal SK activity in unstimulated cells was unaffected by hSKG82D. These data suggest that the mechanism whereby hSKG82D acts as a dominant-negative is through direct competition with SKWT for the, as yet unknown, upstream activator of SK. This proposed mechanism is further supported by the observation that, in untreated cells, hSKG82D does not affect basal endogenous (Fig. 3) or overexpressed SK activity (Fig. 6). Similarly, cell extracts containing high levels of hSKG82Ddid not inhibit the activity of purified human SK in vitro(data not shown), demonstrating that hSKG82D blocks SK activation and not SK activity itself. By inference, these data also support our previous studies (23Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Vandeleur L. Moretti P.A.B. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) suggesting that hSK is a constitutively active enzyme that does not require activation for basal activity. Having established that hSKG82D acts as a specific dominant-negative to ablate activation of endogenous SK by a range of cell agonists, we examined its effect on a pathway proposed to be mediated by S1P and SK activation. Previous studies had shown that activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1,2) activity by TNFα appears to be mediated by SK activation through transient increases in cellular S1P levels (9Xia P. Gamble J.R. Rye K.-A. Wang L. Hii C.S. Cockerill P. Khew-Goodall Y. Bert A.G. Barter P.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14196-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effect of hSKG82D expression on ERK1,2 activation by TNFα. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with either pcDNA3-hSKG82D or empty vector, and the activation of ERK was determined in response to treatment with TNFα and PMA through Western blotting with an anti-phospho-ERK1,2 antibody. Treatment of HEK293T cells transfected with empty vector with TNFα rapidly stimulated activation of ERK1,2 (Fig. 7). In marked contrast, activation of ERK1,2 by TNFα is blocked in HEK293T cells expressing hSKG82D (Fig. 7). PMA-induced activation of ERK1,2, however, remains unaffected demonstrating that expression of hSKG82D does not inherently affect ERK1,2 activation. The activation of ERK1,2 by PMA in the presence of hSKG82D is not surprising because it is known that ERK activation can be achieved by several pathways independent of SK and S1P (57Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 58Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe B. Johnson G.L. Phys. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2304) Google Scholar). Therefore, these data provide, for the first time, unequivocal evidence for the requirement of SK activation and raised cellular S1P levels in TNFα-induced ERK1,2 activation without resorting to the use of chemical inhibitors of questionable specificity. At present the mechanism of this S1P-mediated ERK1,2 activation is unclear. Previous studies have shown that exogenous S1P can activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway via the EDG family of G protein-coupled S1P cell surface receptors (31Lee M.-J.

Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the increased intracellular S1P levels resulting from activation of SK activity lead to secretion of S1P and subsequent engagement of S1P cell surface receptors and activation of ERK1,2. However, previous studies have failed to detect S1P in media from HEK293T and NIH 3T3 cells producing high cellular S1P levels through overexpression of murine SK (56Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). This instead suggests that S1P may activate ERK1,2 via an intracellular mechanism, as has been suggested for other S1P-mediated pathways (61Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.-J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A.

At present the relative abundance of hSK2 compared with hSK is not known, nor is it known if the activity of hSK2 is activated by cell agonists.

The 51-kilobase pair gene for the 15-kDa selenoprotein consisted of five exons and four introns and was localized on chromosome 1p31, a genetic locus commonly mutated or deleted in human cancers. Two stem-loop structures resembling selenocysteine insertion sequence elements were identified in the 3′-untranslated region of the gene, and only one of these was functional. Two alleles in the human 15-kDa protein gene were identified that differed by two single nucleotide polymorphic sites that occurred within the selenocysteine insertion sequence-like structures. These 3′-untranslated region polymorphisms resulted in changes in selenocysteine incorporation into protein and responded differently to selenium supplementation. Human and mouse 15-kDa selenoprotein genes manifested the highest level of expression in prostate, liver, kidney, testis, and brain, and the level of the selenoprotein was reduced substantially in a malignant prostate cell line and in hepatocarcinoma. The expression pattern of the 15-kDa protein in normal and malignant tissues, the occurrence of polymorphisms associated with protein expression, the role of selenium in differential regulation of polymorphisms, and the chromosomal location of the gene may be relevant to a role of this protein in cancer.

The 15-kDa selenoprotein was initially identified as a strongly labeled protein that was detected when human T cells were grown in the presence of [75Se]selenite (11Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T.

The open reading frame within the human 15-kDa protein cDNA coded for 162 residues and contained an in-frame TGA codon that would result in the incorporation of Sec at codon position 93. A putative stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, was predicted in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR). SECIS elements are required for insertion of Sec into protein at in-frame TGA codons and are located in the 3′-UTR of higher eukaryotic selenoprotein mRNAs and immediately downstream of the UGA Sec codon in bacterial selenoprotein mRNAs (12Low S.C. Berry M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The 15-kDa protein did not have homology to previously characterized proteins, but homologous sequences were detected in other mammals as well as in the nematodes Caenorhabditis elegansand Brugia malayi (11Gladyshev V.N.

Nutritional levels of selenium have been inversely correlated to the incidence of both prostate and lung cancer in human epidemiological studies (13Knekt P. Marniemi J. Teppo L. Heliovaara M.

In addition, recent supplementation trials suggest that selenium may be effective in the reduction of common human cancers, including those of the prostate, colon and lung (15Clark L.C. Combs Jr., G.F. Turnbull B.W. Slate E.H. Chalker D.K. Chow J. Davis L.S. Glover R.A. Graham G.F. Gross E.G. Krongrad A. Lesher Jr., J.L. Park H.K. Sanders Jr., B.B. Smith C.L. Taylor J.R. JAMA. 1996; 276: 1957-1963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the presence of selenium in human proteins (1Stadtman T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 3Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. J. Biomed. Sci. 1999; 6: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), the absolute developmental requirement for selenoprotein synthesis (16Bosl M.R. Takaku K. Oshima M. Nishimura S. Taketo M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5531-5534Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and that selenium availability at nutritional levels can influence selenoprotein levels (17Thompson K.M. Haibach H. Evenson J.K. Sunde R.A. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 1289-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), it is probable that the chemopreventive properties of this element are mediated through its role in one or more selenoproteins. However, none of the identified selenoproteins have conclusively been linked to either the prevention or susceptibility to any human cancers. As a first step in evaluating the biological role of the newly discovered 15-kDa selenoprotein and its possible involvement as a chemopreventive agent in cancer, we have characterized the 15-kDa protein gene in humans and the corresponding cDNA sequence in mice. This analysis revealed a polymorphism in the human SECIS element that influences the level of 15-kDa protein synthesis. In addition, the 15-kDa protein was found to be expressed in high levels in organs that are protected from malignancy by selenium and in reduced levels in the corresponding cancerous organs. These studies, along with the observation that the 15-kDa protein gene maps at a chromosomal location often associated with malignancy (18Cheung T.H. Chung T.K. Poon C.S. Hampton G.M. Wang V.W.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1752-1757PubMed Google Scholar), raise the possibility that selenium may protect against cancer, at least in part, through its influence on this protein. Human liver mRNA was obtained from Invitrogen, mouse cDNA clones from Genome Systems, and total RNA from human tissues (human brain, pooled from two male Caucasians, ages 43 and 47; human heart, pooled from eight male/female Caucasians, ages 25–73; human kidney, pooled from eight male/female Caucasians, ages 25–55; human liver, pooled from one male and one female Caucasian, ages 35 and 15; human lung, pooled from five male/female Caucasians, ages 14–40; human trachea, pooled from 84 male/female Caucasians, ages 19–65; human mammary gland, pooled from eight female Caucasians, ages 16–45; human prostate, pooled from 23 male Caucasians, ages 23–64; human skeletal muscle, pooled from 10 male/female Caucasians, ages 23–56 (muscle of thigh, ileopsoas, and pectoralis major); human testis, pooled from 19 male Caucasians, ages 17–61; and human uterus, pooled from 10 female Caucasians, ages 15–77) and mouse multiple tissue mRNA blots from CLONTECH. The mouse prostate adenocarcinoma cell line Pr-14 (20Jorcyk C.L. Liu M.L. Shibata M.A. Maroulakou I.G. Komschlies K.L. McPhaul M.J. Resau J.H. Green J.E. Prostate. 1998; 34: 10-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Cheryl Jorcyk and Jeffrey Green (National Institutes of Health). Normal and malignant livers from transforming growth factor α (TGFα)/c-myc transgenic mice (21Santoni-Rugiu E. Nagy P. Jensen M.R. Factor V.M. Thorgeirsson S.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 407-428PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained as described previously (22Gladyshev V.N. Factor V.M. Housseau F. Hatfield D.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 251: 488-493Google Scholar). Immunoblot reagents SuperSignal and ECL were obtained from Pierce and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, respectively, pET-21b(+) vector from Novagen, the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene, Lipofectin Reagent from Life Technologies, Inc., the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column from Qiagen, the TSK-gel Phenyl 5-PW column from TosoHaas, and the Mono-Q column from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, Reporter Lysis Buffer, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activity assay systems were obtained from Promega. ThermoFidelase I was from Fidelity Systems. All other reagents were of the highest grade available. The human cDNA for the 15-kDa protein (11Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Wootton J.C. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8910-8915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) was used as a probe to search, in a hybridization screen, for a genomic DNA clone in human BAC and PAC libraries from Genome Systems. One ∼100-kb clone hybridized with the probe, and the 15-kDa protein gene present in the clone was sequenced using a primer walking strategy. Sequencing was achieved without subcloning using a recently developed procedure for direct sequencing of BAC templates employing ThermoFidelase I (23Slesarev, A. I., Belova, G. I., Lake, J. A., and Kozyavkin, S. A. (2000) Methods Enzymol., in press.Google Scholar). The addition of ThermoFidelase I into the cycle sequencing reaction allowed reading through G/C-rich regions and prevented the stuttering of DNA polymerase on single nucleotide repeats. A contiguous 64-kb genomic DNA sequence was generated that contained the 51-kb 15-kDa selenoprotein gene, except that approximately half of intron 2 was taken from a partial sequence of a BAC clone generated by the Human Genome Project (accession number HSDJ604K5). Primer extension analysis to map the transcription start site of the 15-kDa protein gene was performed according to a previously developed procedure (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A synthetic oligonucleotide primer (5′-GCCAACAACAACCGTAGC-3′) complementary to the 5′-end of the open reading frame (+96/+79 from the initiation codon) of the selenoprotein gene was 5′-labeled with [α-32P]ATP and hybridized to 0.5 μg of human liver mRNA. The resulting complex was then reverse transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. Extension products were electrophoresed on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by a PhosphorImager. Sequences of two mouse cDNA clones (accession numbers for EST clones are AA69039 and W71333) homologous to the human 15-kDa protein sequence were determined using a Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Northern blot analyses using the mouse cDNA probe for detecting the 15-kDa protein mRNA were performed on a membrane fromCLONTECH. Northern blot analyses to detect the human 15-kDa protein mRNA were performed by running total human RNA on a formaldehyde agarose gel, transferring it onto a Nylon membrane, and hybridizing with a human cDNA as a probe. Southern blot analyses using the human 15-kDa protein cDNA as probe, and hybridization assays were performed as described (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A blot containing mRNA isolated from mouse testis following sucrose gradient fractionation of polysomal and nonpolysomal RNA and subsequent isolation of RNA from each fraction was prepared as described (25Kleene K.C. Distel R.J. Hecht N.B. Dev. Biol. 1984; 105: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies that were raised against the C-terminal peptide in the human 15-kDa protein (11Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Wootton J.C. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8910-8915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) were used for detection of the selenoprotein in mouse protein extracts. Sequencing of the mouse cDNA revealed that mouse and human selenoproteins had identical C-terminal amino acid sequences. SuperSignal and ECL systems were used for signal detection. The isolated human 15-kDa protein was obtained as described (11Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Wootton J.C. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8910-8915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and used as a control for immunoblot assays. The mouse prostate adenocarcinoma cell line Pr-14 was grown as described previously (20Jorcyk C.L. Liu M.L. Shibata M.A. Maroulakou I.G. Komschlies K.L. McPhaul M.J. Resau J.H. Green J.E. Prostate. 1998; 34: 10-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Extracts of malignant and matching normal livers from male TGFα/c-mycdouble-transgenic mice were prepared as described (22Gladyshev V.N. Factor V.M. Housseau F. Hatfield D.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 251: 488-493Google Scholar) from either the same or different animals as indicated. These mice, generated in a CD1xB6CBA F1 background, overexpress TGFα and oncogene c-myc, and represent a well characterized in vivomodel of accelerated hepatocarcinogenesis (21Santoni-Rugiu E. Nagy P. Jensen M.R. Factor V.M. Thorgeirsson S.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 407-428PubMed Google Scholar). Male TGFα/c-myc mice develop easily identifiable liver tumors at the age of 6–10 months. Oligonucleotide primers 5′-CCAAGCTTTAGGCGTTAATGAAGACTACACAG-3′ and 5′-CCGCGGCCGCTGTATGTATCTGATCCACACAA-3′ complementary to cDNA positions 1092–1112 and 1130–1150 of human 15-kDa selenoprotein were designed with terminal HindIII and NotI sites, respectively. Primers were used to PCR-amplify the minimal SECIS element from the C811/G1125 cDNA. Mutagenesis to generate the polymorphic variant element that has A1125 in place of G1125 was carried out by amplification of an internal mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-TTAATGAAGA CTACACAGAA AACCTTTCTA AGGATTTGTG TGGATCAGATACA-3′ containing the desired nucleotide changes in combination with the above wild-type oligonucleotides encoding the terminal restriction sites. PCR products were digested with the appropriate enzymes and subcloned into the corresponding sites of G16-D10ΔH3 (26Martin III, G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA. 1996; 2: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Once subcloned, the amplified regions were sequenced in their entirety. Transient transfections were carried out in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells using the calcium phosphate method of transfection as described previously (27Berry M.J. Banu L. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Three days prior to transfection, HEK 293 cells were plated onto 60-mm culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with 10 μg of the pUHD10-3-based expression plasmids and 4 μg of the pUHD15 plasmid (28Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar), which encodes a protein necessary for transcriptional activation of the pUHD10-3 promoter. To monitor transfection efficiencies, cells were co-transfected with 3 μg of an expression vector containing the human growth hormone cDNA under control of the hamster sarcoma virus thymidine kinase promoter. Medium was changed 1 day following transfection. Two days after transfection, cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.9, containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.25m sucrose. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection by scraping and sonicated, and cell sonicates were assayed for 5′-deiodinase activity as described previously (27Berry M.J. Banu L. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.9, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 msucrose, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Cells were then sonicated and assayed for the ability to 5′-deiodinate 125I reverse T3. Reactions contained 10–250 μg of protein, 1 μm125I reverse T3, and 10 mmdithiothreitol in a reaction volume of 300 μl. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. 125I release was quantitated as described previously (27Berry M.J. Banu L. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Deiodinase activities were calculated per microliter of cell sonicate and normalized to the amount of growth hormone secreted into the medium. All constructs were tested in at least three separate transfections, and deiodinase assays were performed in duplicate from each transfection. Reporter constructs designed to evaluate SECIS element function were generated using human DNAs for which the nucleotide positions at 811 and 1125 of the 15-kDa 3′-UTR were determined by PCR amplification and diagnostic restriction enzyme digestion. 2Y.

A 533-nucleotide PCR amplification product containing the SECIS element was generated using human DNA as a template and primers including the restriction endonuclease recognition sequence for eitherSpeI (5′-AAAACTAGTGCTTTGTAACAGACTTGCGGTTAATTATGC-3′) orPstI (5′-AAACTGCAGGGTCTTACAAATGATCACTTTTAAATGGAC-3′). PCR products were cleaved with those enzymes and directionally inserted into the polycloning site of the pBPLUGA vector (30Kollmus H. Flohe L. McCarthy J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The reporter construct was co-transfected into mouse fibroblasts (NIH 3T3) with the pSV2neo plasmid at a 10:1 molar ratio using the Lipofectin reagent. Lysates were generated by a single freeze-thaw cycle following suspension in Reporter Lysis Buffer, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined using the corresponding assay systems. Luciferase activity was quantified using a Fentomaster FB12 Luminometer from Zylux. For selenium supplementation conditions, the cells were incubated at the indicated concentration of sodium selenite for 5 days prior to lysis. Protein and DNA homology analyses were performed with BLAST programs (31Madden T.L. Tatusov R.L. Zhang J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 131-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Putative structures for human and mouse 15-kDa protein mRNAs were predicted with mfold (32Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3232) Google Scholar) and SECISearch (9Kryukov G.V. Kryukov V.M. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33888-33897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) programs. The presence of N-terminal signal peptides was determined with sequence analysis programs SignalP and PSORT II. A human BAC library was screened with a radioactive probe representing the human 15-kDa protein cDNA resulting in the isolation of a positively hybridizing clone. Restriction enzyme analysis of this clone by Southern blotting indicated that a variety of infrequent cutting restriction endonucleases used separately to digest the BAC insert resulted in several 15-kDa protein cDNA-hybridizing fragments (data not shown). This suggested that the 15-kDa selenoprotein gene was relatively large and constituted a significant portion of the BAC clone. A recently developed technique of direct sequencing of large genomic DNA clones using a ThermoFidelase system was then utilized to determine the insert sequence using primers designed from the selenoprotein cDNA sequence followed by a primer walking strategy to determine intron sequences. The structural organization of the human 15-kDa protein gene is shown in Fig. 1 and TableI. By comparison of the obtained gene sequence and the previously reported cDNA sequence, the gene for the 15-kDa protein was established to be 51 kb long and consisted of five exons and four introns (Table I). All exon-intron junctions contained the consensus AG/GT sequences that typically flank splice junctions (Table I). Computer search analysis of the determined gene sequence against dbESTs identified several positional markers supporting the previous determination that the gene for the 15-kDa protein is located on chromosome 1 at position 1p31 (data not shown).Table IOrganization of the 15-kDa protein geneExon (size, bp)Coding informationIntron (size, bp)Splice donorSplice acceptor1 (97)5′-UTR + coding region for signal peptide1 (10,610)AAGCGgtgagttcagGTGTC2 (168)Coding region2 (22,561)AAAAGgtacttgtagCTGTA3 (64)Coding region (selenocysteine)3 (12,537)CCAAGgtataataagCTTTT4 (50)Coding region4 (4446)TCAAGgtaagtgtagTATGT5 (>883)Coding region + 3′-UTRExon sequences are shown in uppercase and intron sequences in lowercase. bp, base pairs.

The first exon in the selenoprotein gene included the 5′-UTR as well as the first 27 amino acid residues corresponding to a putative signal peptide. This N-terminal peptide, while predicted from the gene sequence, was absent in the isolated human T-cell 15-kDa selenoprotein as evidenced by direct determination of the mass of the isolated selenoprotein and by direct sequencing of the tryptic peptides derived from the 15-kDa protein (11Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Wootton J.C. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8910-8915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The coding of an N-terminal signal peptide by a unique exon is often seen for other mammalian proteins. The TGA codon that encodes Sec was located in exon 3, while the largest exon, exon 5, contained the C-terminal coding region and the complete 3′-UTR. In addition, we determined 6.8 kb in the 5′-flanking and 6.0 kb 3′-flanking regions for the human 15-kDa protein gene. The first 477 nucleotides of the gene for heparan sulfate 2-sulfotransferase (accession number AB007917) were detected in the reverse orientation upstream of the selenoprotein gene within nucleotides 5741–6217 of the BAC clone. The downstream neighbor of the 15-kDa selenoprotein gene could not be identified. A computer search analyses for sequences homologous to the human 15-kDa protein detected a previously deposited sequence on human chromosome 7q31–3q32 (82% identity to the 15-kDa protein cDNA sequence in a 125-nucleotide overlap; accession number AC004925). This sequence lacked introns and was characterized by in-frame stop signals, suggesting that it represented a 15-kDa protein pseudogene that probably arose by reintegration of a cDNA copy of the 15-kDa protein mRNA. In order to establish the site of transcription initiation, primer extension of an oligonucleotide that complemented the region encoding the N-terminal portion of the coding region (+96/+79 from the initiation codon) was utilized. The primer was extended up to 20 bases beyond the point corresponding to the bases of the open reading frame (Fig. 2). The nucleotide at the initiation site was adenylic acid. The gene did not contain a canonical TATA box consensus sequence about 30 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site as is common among many polymerase II transcribed genes. The sequence at the initiation site, AGAAACC (where A designates the transcription start point) is similar to the approximate consensus sequence reported for mammalian polymerase II-transcribed genes that initiate transcription with or without an upstream TATA box (33Javahery R.

Clearly, the nucleotide at the transcription start point for the 15-kDa protein gene and those nucleotides downstream fit the consensus sequence, while the two purines upstream do not conform. The human 15-kDa protein cDNA was represented in dbEST by more than 200 independent EST sequences. Based on these available sequence data, it was apparent that exon 4, predicted to consist of 50 nucleotides, was missing in ∼7.5% of the ESTs (3 out of 42). A transcript lacking exon 4 would be slightly shorter (149 residues in length) and would presumably be a nonfunctional polypeptide. Interestingly, if this alternative splicing was to occur in the human 15-kDa protein gene, two in-frame TGA codons downstream of the TGA Sec codon would be present. Translation of this transcript would yield a protein containing three Sec residues. Determining whether such a polypeptide is indeed expressed in human cells will require further studies. However, in preliminary experiments we could not detect DNA sequences lacking exon 4 when total human brain, kidney, liver, heart, and lung RNAs were amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR with primers corresponding to exons 3 and 5, followed by sequencing of PCR products. In contrast, the sequence containing exon 4 was observed by this method (data not shown). The presence of a SECIS element in the 3′-UTR of eukaryotic selenoprotein genes is necessary and sufficient to decode in-frame TGA codons as Sec (12Low S.C. Berry M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The human 15-kDa protein gene has a single functional SECIS element (see below). Unlike this and other known mammalian selenoprotein genes that encode a single Sec residue and contain a single SECIS element, the selenoprotein P gene encodes 10–12 Sec residues and contains two di"

The open reading frame of JAM2 predicts a 34-kDa type I integral membrane protein that features two Ig-like folds and three N-linked glycosylation sites in the extracellular domain. A single protein kinase C phosphorylation consensus site and a PDZ-binding motif are present in the short intracellular tail. Heterologous expression of JAM2 in Chinese hamster ovary cells defined a 48-kDa protein that localizes predominantly to the intercellular borders. Northern blot analysis showed that JAM2 is preferentially expressed in the heart. JAM2 homotypic interactions were demonstrated by the ability of JAM2-Fc to capture JAM2-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells. We further showed that JAM2, but not JAM1, is capable of adhering to the HSB and HPB-ALL lymphocyte cell lines. Neutralizing mouse anti-JAM2 polyclonal antibodies provided evidence against homotypic interactions in this assay. Biotinylation of HSB cell membranes revealed a 43-kDa counter-receptor that precipitates specifically with JAM2-Fc. These characteristics of JAM2 led us to hypothesize a role for this novel protein in adhesion events associated with cardiac inflammatory conditions.

The various vascular segments display heterogeneity in their use of adherens, gap, and tight junctions (1Simionescu M. Simionescu N. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 68: 705-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Contacts occur most apically at the tight junction; and in 1998, it was reported that a novel junctional adhesion molecule (JAM)1 co-localizes with this dynamic regulated structure (2Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). JAM belongs to the Ig-like superfamily of adhesion molecules. The mouse JAM protein is expressed in endothelium and epithelium, whereas the human homologue is additionally found on peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets (2Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J.

Pro-inflammatory stimuli promote tethering, rolling, and subsequent firm adhesion of leukocytes to the luminal vessel wall (5Atherton A. Born G. J. Physiol. (Lond. ). 1972; 222: 447-474Crossref Scopus (258) Google Scholar). These effects are mediated by the concerted action of endothelial cell selectins and the Ig adhesion molecules VCAM and ICAM (6Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6400) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying the subsequent diapedesis of leukocytes through the endothelial monolayer are not yet fully understood, although a key role for PECAM has been demonstrated using neutralizing antibodies (7Muller W.A. Weigl S.A. Deng X. Phillips D.M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 8Vaporciyan A.A. DeLisser H.M. Yan H.C. Mendiguren I.I. Thom S.R. Jones M.L. Ward P.A. Albelda S.M. Science. 1993; 262: 1580-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). PECAM is also targeted to the lateral membranes of endothelia, but does not co-localize with junctional structures (9Ayalon O. Sabanai H. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. Geiger B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Most recent evidence supports a role for JAM in leukocyte transmigration and inflammation. A neutralizing monoclonal antibody is effective at reducing spontaneous and chemokine-mediated monocyte passage across endothelial monolayers (2Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Furthermore, neutralization of JAM has proven effective in reducing not only monocyte, but also neutrophil transmigration across brain endothelium in a mouse model of meningitis (10Del Maschio A. De Luigi A. Martin-Padura I. Brockhaus M. Bartfai T. Fruscella P. Adorini L. Martino G. Furlan R. De Simoni M.G. Dejana E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1351-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). That JAM impinges on the inflammatory pathway is further substantiated by its redistribution to the endothelial cell surface in response to tumor necrosis factor-α/interferon-γ (11Ozaki H. Ishii K. Horiuchi H. Arai H. Kawamoto T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kita T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 553-557PubMed Google Scholar). PECAM and JAM share some structural and functional similarities. Both adhesion proteins belong to the Ig superfamily; they localize at intercellular clefts; and neutralizing antibodies raised against either protein are effective at inhibiting the paracellular movement of leukocytes. PECAM engages in homotypic interactions in addition to heterotypic binding to the αVβ3 integrin and proteoglycans (12DeLisser H.M. Chilkotowsky J. Yan H.C. Daise M.L. Buck C.A. Albelda S.M. J.

Nevertheless, a counter-receptor on leukocytes is postulated since neutralizing antibodies do not affect JAM-JAM interactions (2Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M.

JAM possesses two V-type immunoglobulin domains, a novel structure for an Ig superfamily adhesion protein. We reasoned that JAM would belong to a family of adhesion molecules possessing similar structure and perhaps intercellular location. Using the public expressed sequence tag data base, we have identified a related putative adhesion molecule that shows preferential expression in the heart. For comparative purposes, we also isolated the human homologue to mouse JAM. We propose that the originally identified mouse JAM and its human counterpart be referred to as JAM1. In this report, we describe the novel JAM2 sequence, chromosomal localization, and expression characteristics. Furthermore, we show that JAM2 shows selective adherence to immortalized T lymphocyte lines in vitro. JAM2 (V89915) was identified using the public expressed sequence tag (EST) data base. Sequences homologous to mouse JAM (U89915) were isolated using the tblastn program.AA406389 and AA912674 were assembled to form the 3′-end of human JAM2 (Fig. 1 b). Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was employed to obtain further 5′-sequence (Fig. 1 c). For RACE-1, human placental mRNA was reverse-transcribed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) at 42 °C with primer 5′-CCCCGCATCACTTCTTGTCACATTTTTGATCCGG-3′. For RACE-2, Thermoscript (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 58 °C was used with primer 5′-CTGCTCTGAGGAGGTCGAGGGTCCC-3′. Cycling was as follows: one cycle at 94 °C for 30 s; five cycles at 94 °C for 5 s and 72 °C for 4 min; five cycles at 94 °C for 5 s and 70 °C for 4 min; and 25 cycles at 94 °C for 5 s and 68 °C for 4 min. Full-length JAM2 was constructed from two polymerase chain reaction products that encompassed an internal EcoNIrestriction site. The 5′-product (extracellular domain) was generated with sense (5′-GCCGCggatccAAGATGGCGAGGAGG-3′) and antisense (5′-(GCTATTATGCCggtaccGTTGAGATCATC-3′) primers by amplifying with ampliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as follows: one cycle at 95 °C for 120 s; 35 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, 58 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; and one cycle at 72 °C for 180 s. A 3′-product was synthesized with sense (5′-TAAAAATCGAGCTGAGATGATAG-3′; 248 bp from ATG) and antisense (5′-TTAAATTATAAAGGATTTTGTG-3′) primers as follows: one cycle at 95 °C for 420 s; 28 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, 56 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; and one cycle at 72 °C for 300 s. To confirm each base, three independent products were sequenced (ABI sequencer, Seqwright, Houston, TX). The full open reading frame of human JAM1 was assembled from the overlapping ESTs, AA152150, T87045, T73746, and AA101561 (Fig.1 d). A polymerase chain reaction product was synthesized from human umbilical vein endothelial cells mRNA using sense (5′-ggatcCGCGATGGGGACAAAGGCGC-3′) and antisense (5′-ggtaccACCAGGAATGACGAGGTC-3′) oligonucleotides by cycling as follows: one cycle at 95 °C for 7 min; 28 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, 56 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; and one cycle at 5 min for 72 °C. To confirm each base, three independent products were sequenced. An extracellular domain polymerase chain reaction product of JAM2 was random prime-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and hybridized to normalized human cardiovascular specific and multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) under high stringency. Transcripts were viewed by autoradiography following exposure of the blot to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at −70 °C. To identify genomic sequence, the public non-redundant data base was searched using the blastn program with JAM2 cDNA sequence. The results required minor manual modification due to dual designation of isolated bases at the end of some exon boundaries. The correct designation was based on 5′- and 3′-splice site consensus sequences. It was possible to confirm all intron/exon boundaries by retrieving identical information from more than one deposit of genomic sequence. The full-length clone of JAM2 with a C-terminal hemagglutinin tag was subcloned into pcDNA6 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). CHO-K1 cells were transfected with 10 μg of vector possessing either no insert or JAM2 using FuGENETM 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Stable cells lines (control and JAM2) were selected with 5–10 μg/ml blasticidin. For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 buffer in the presence of protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture set III, Calbiochem). Approximately 36 μg of protein was electrophoresed through 10% polyacrylamide gels and probed with a 1:2000 times dilution of preimmune or anti-JAM2 polyclonal serum. Specific bands were viewed using enhanced chemiluminescence with a 1:30,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Fisher). For JAM2, the extracellular domain polymerase chain reaction product was digested with BamHI/KpnI and subcloned into a pFastBac1 vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) possessing the constant region of mouse IgG2a (17Cunningham S.A. Tran T.M. Arrate M.P. Brock T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18421-18427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For JAM1, the ectodomain was synthesized with sense (5′-ggatccGCGATGGGGACAAAGGCGC-3′) and antisense (5′-GATggtaccCACATTCCGCTCC-3′) primers with cycling as follows: one cycle at 95 °C for 120 s; 23 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, 56 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 10 s; and one cycle at 72 °C for 300 s. Secreted recombinant JAM2 and JAM1 fusion proteins were purified from the media of infected Sf21 cells using HiTrap protein A columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For preparation of JAM2 immunogen, thrombin cleavage was used to release JAM2 from the Fc portion of the secreted recombinant fusion protein. The digest was reapplied to the protein A column to remove Fc. Female BALB/c mice (8 week olds; Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) were immunized and then boosted three times, 28 days apart, by intraperitoneal and subcutaneous injections of 100 μg of purified JAM2 extracellular domain emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's adjuvant. Complete Freund's adjuvant was used for the first immunization, and incomplete Freund's adjuvant for subsequent injections. Serum was collected 10 days following each boost. CHO-K1 (control or JAM2-expressing) cells grown on glass slides to confluence were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and stained with a 1:100 dilution of either preimmune or mouse anti-JAM2 polyclonal serum. goat anti-mouse-fluorescein isothiocyanate at 1:100 was used as a secondary antibody. Fluorescence was viewed using a NoranTM confocal laser-scanning microscope (Noran Instruments Inc., Middleton, WI) equipped with an argon laser and appropriate optics and filter module for fluorescein isothiocyanate detection. Digital images were obtained at ×400 using a 0.75N/A Nikon ×20 lens. A z axis motor attached to the inverted microscope stage was calibrated to move the plane of focus at 0.4-μm steps through the sample. Collected 12-bit gray scale images at 512 × 480 resolution, stored on a rewritable optical hard disc, were volumetrically reconstructed using the Image-1/MetamorphTM three-dimensional module (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). Ectodomain-Fc adhesion assays were performed in 96-well plates essentially as described previously (18Todderud G. Alford J. Millsap K.A. Aruffo A. Tramposch K.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1992; 52: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG2a was coated at 5 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline and used to capture 4.8 pmol of JAM2-Fc, JAM1-Fc, VCAM-Fc, or mouse IgG2a (control). CHO and various leukocyte cell lines (i.e. T lymphocytes, HSB and HPB-ALL; B lymphocytes, RAMOS; monocytic cells, HL-60 and THP-1; and the erythroleukemic K562 line) were labeled with calcein (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) at 50 μg/ml for 25 min at 37 °C. Cell binding was performed for 90 min at 37 °C with 250,000 cells/well in binding buffer consisting of Tris-buffered saline plus 1 mm each of CaCl2, MgCl2, and MnCl2. Wells were washed three times and lysed with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40, and fluorescence was read in a Cytofluor with excitation at 485/20 nm and emission at 530/25 nm. Specific binding was calculated by removal of values obtained by capture of mouse IgG2a. When the various cell lines were compared, curves for calcein uptake were generated for each experiment to convert arbitrary fluorescence units into cell number. For antibody inhibition, either JAM2-Fc protein captured on wells or HSB cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in binding buffer with a 1:100 dilution of preimmune (normal mouse serum) or mouse anti-JAM2 polyclonal serum. Following incubation, excess antibody was removed by washing three times prior to continuation of the assay. HSB or K562 cells were surface-biotinylated using EZ-Link sulfosuccinimidobiotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells (2.5 × 107/ml) were washed three times following incubation with 0.5 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidobiotin for 30 min at room temperature. Cell lysis was achieved in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm each MnCl2, MgCl2, and CaCl2 with the inclusion of protease inhibitor mixture set III. Approximately 5 μg of JAM-Fc fusion protein was added to ∼1 mg of lysate and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Proteins bound to JAM were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose (30 μl), boiled for 5 min with 10 mm dithiothreitol in SDS sample buffer, and separated on 9% SDS gels. Following transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, biotinylated proteins were detected using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:4000) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fig. 2 depicts the complete cDNA and amino acid sequences of human JAM2. The open reading frame possesses 298 amino acids and features a putative signal sequence, an extracellular domain consisting of two Ig-like folds, a single transmembrane region, and a short intracellular domain. There are two possible cleavage sites for the signal peptide, i.e. VVA-LG (underlined) or AYG-FS (dash-underlined). In the extracellular region, there are three potential N-linked glycosylation sites (NX(S/T)) at amino acids 98, 187, and 236. In the short intracellular tail, at amino acid 279, a protein kinase C phosphorylation consensus site ((S/T)X(R/K)) exists. At the extreme C terminus, a potential binding motif for PDZ domains is apparent (SFII). We were unable to identify an in-frame and upstream stop codon for human JAM2 in the 5′-untranslated sequence. That the designated ATG is the true translational initiation signal is supported by its context within a Kozak consensus sequence and alignment with JAM1 ATG (Fig. 3).Figure 3Alignment of human JAM2 and JAM1 amino acid sequences. Upper sequence, JAM2; lower sequence, JAM1. Sequences show 44% similarity and 35% identity. The asterisk denotes the conserved glycosylation site between JAM2 and JAM1. The protein kinase C consensus sites in both JAM2 and JAM1 are underlined, and the cAMP/cGMP consensus site in JAM1 is double-underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To compare sequences of human JAM family members, we isolated human JAM1 cDNA. Prior to our report of this sequence, human JAM1 was isolated using a different approach by Ozaki et al. (11Ozaki H. Ishii K. Horiuchi H. Arai H. Kawamoto T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kita T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 553-557PubMed Google Scholar) (GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number AF111713). Alignment of human JAM2 with JAM1 revealed 44% similarity and 35% identity at the amino acid level (Fig. 3). Similarly, alignment with mouse JAM1 amino acid sequence showed 43% similarity and 35% identity (data not shown). The glycosylation motif at amino acid 187 is conserved between family members. However, JAM1 possesses a cAMP/cGMP consensus site in the intracellular domain that is absent in JAM2. JAM2 was mapped to chromosome 21 at position q21.2 using the public data base. Sequence was retrieved at 100% identity from two contiguous non-overlapping sequences of 100,000 bp each (GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession numbers AP000087.1 and AP000086.1). Thecoding region of JAM2, which constitutes 897 bp, is distributed over 10 exons (Table I). The limits of the JAM2 cDNA sequence shown in Fig. 2 span ∼74,853 bp of genomic DNA. Various exons were also found in AP000223 (coding exon 1), AP000225 (coding exons 2–6), and AP000226 (coding exons 6–10). Since the complete JAM2 transcript(s) is considerably larger than 897 bp (Fig. 4), further exons in the untranslated regions remain to be identified either up and/or downstream. All intron/exon boundaries conform to the consensus GT/AG rule (19Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar).Table IChromosomal organization of JAM23′-SpliceExon No.Exon5′-SpliceIntronbpbpnnnnnn/(N)1≥305TGGGCT/gtaagt43,994tttcag/ATCATA266ACCAAG/gtacag5916tcctag/AGGCTA3108TTCAAG/gtaagc3781taaaag/GTGATT4153TATTAG/gtgatg4767gttcag/TGGCTC5203ACTCTG/gtaagg3290aaatag/CAATTT6100AAGTAG/gtaagc3709ttccag/ATGATC7108TTTCAA/gtaagt3347ttgtag/AAGAAA816CTTCCA/gtaagt2890aaacag/GAAGAG943GAAAAT/gtgagt2256tcctag/GATTTC10>221NNNNNN/(n)Lowercase and uppercase letters denote intron and exon sequences, respectively. n/N represent unknown bases.

Two transcripts of ∼1.5 and <4.4 kilobases were apparent under high stringency. These two species likely represent alternatively spliced products. Of the 12 tissues examined, human JAM2 appears to be preferably expressed in the heart. However, the transcript could also be detected to some degree in several other tissues, most notably the placenta. Fig. 4 Bshows a more detailed examination of the JAM2 transcript in the heart. A clear chamber-specific expression was not apparent. Relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, there was somewhat lower expression in fetal heart. However, major differences in the aorta, atrium, and ventricles were not observed. To facilitate study of this protein, we generated a JAM2-overexpressing CHO cell line and a mouse anti-JAM2 polyclonal serum raised against the ectodomain. Western blotting of CHO cell lysate estimated a 48-kDa protein (Fig. 5). This is ∼14 kDa larger than the size predicted from the peptide sequence. Glycosylation of JAM2 on at least one of its three N-linked glycosylation consensus sites could explain this phenomenon. For cellular localization, we stained confluent monolayers of both control and JAM2-expressing CHO cells with the anti-JAM2 antiserum. Fig. 6 shows that JAM2 mainly partitioned to sites of cell-cell contact, although some surface membrane fluorescence was observed. The border pattern of staining was identical to those shown by mouse JAM1 expressed in CHO cells and by endogenous human JAM1 expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. For JAM1, this phenomenon contributed to the hypothesis that the extracellular domain forms homotypic interactions between cells. To address the possibility of JAM2 homotypic binding, we utilized the recombinant ectodomain and tested its ability to capture the JAM2-expressing CHO cell line. Adhesion of calcein-loaded cells was performed under static conditions according to a previously established and well documented in vitro binding assay (18Todderud G. Alford J. Millsap K.A. Aruffo A. Tramposch K.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1992; 52: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the same series of experiments, we examined JAM1 homotypic interactions and asked whether JAM2 could form heterotypic interactions with JAM1. Fig.7 shows that JAM2 was clearly capable of capturing CHO cells expressing JAM2, but not control cells or those expressing JAM1. Furthermore, JAM1 was unable to maintain homotypic interactions under these conditions. It has been demonstrated that JAM1 participates in leukocyte migration. Reasoning that JAM2 may also impinge on leukocyte adhesion and/or migration, we examined the capacity of the JAM2 extracellular domain to adhere to various leukocyte cell lines. Calcein-loaded cells were allowed to interact with JAM2-Fc captured in 96-well plates. Nonspecific binding of cells to captured mouse IgG2a was determined simultaneously and subtracted. JAM1-Fc was incorporated into the assay for comparative purposes. VCAM-Fc was included as a positive control for all cell lines with the exception of K562, which does not express VCAM counter-receptors. Fig. 8 shows that JAM2-Fc was able to capture the T lymphocyte cell lines HSB and HPB-ALL quite efficiently. The binding of these cells to IgG2a was always <2% of the binding to JAM2. In contrast, interactions with B lymphocytes (RAMOS), monocytic cells (HL-60 and THP-1), and the erythroleukemic K562 cell line were negligible. Most interestingly, JAM1-Fc was unable to adhere to any of these cell lines. As demonstrated, JAM2 is capable of homotypic interactions. Thus, we next addressed whether the JAM2 ectodomain bound HSB cells through this mechanism. Fig. 4 A shows that, unlike JAM1, JAM2 did not show expression in peripheral blood leukocytes. Nevertheless, to verify lack of expression in HSB cells, we used the mouse polyclonal serum to probe for JAM2 protein expression by Western blotting. No protein was detected (Fig. 5). As further proof, we compared the surface JAM2 expression levels using the following more sensitive test. The HSB and control and JAM2-expressing CHO cells were loaded with calcein and incubated with either normal mouse serum or anti-JAM2 serum. Cell surface-bound anti-JAM2 antibody was detected by cell capture in 96-well plates coated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies. TableII shows that although the anti-JAM2 serum was very effective at capturing CHO cells expressing the JAM2 protein, no HSB cell binding was apparent.Table IIComparison of surface JAM2 expression on HSB and CHO cellsCell typeAntibodyMean ± S.E.HSBPre1877 ± 234JAM21135 ± 97CHO controlPre1210 ± 63JAM21019 ± 44CHO-JAM2Pre2151 ± 287JAM2112,329 ± 4457Calcein-loaded HSB, CHO control, and CHO-JAM2 cells (n= 6) were incubated in the presence of 1:100 dilutions of mouse serum, washed, captured on 96-well plates precoated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, and lysed.

Mean ± S.E. represents number of cells captured. Pre, preimmune serum; JAM2, anti-JAM2 polyclonal serum. To extend these studies, we tested the ability of the mouse anti-JAM2 serum to neutralize HSB binding to recombinant JAM2. Antibody was used to block epitopes on recombinant JAM2 captured on 96-well plates. TableIII shows that although preimmune serum was ineffective, anti-JAM2 serum successfully prevented HSB binding. Since relatively high levels of JAM2 were coated on these wells, we were confident that if low levels were expressed on HSB cells, the antibody should be capable of producing inhibition when incubated directly with HSB cells. As predicted, under this experimental setup, the anti-JAM2 antibody was unable to inhibit HSB interactions with recombinant JAM2.Table IIIEffect of neutralizing antibodies on the JAM2-HSB cell interactionAntibodyMean ± S.E.A.

To strengthen this hypothesis and to gain a preliminary characterization of the protein, we performed precipitation experiments using JAM2-Fc. HSB cells were surface-biotinylated, washed, lysed, and incubated with JAM2-Fc. Bound proteins were precipitated using protein A and viewed on Western blots with avidin-horseradish peroxidase.

Previously, we have shown that the anti-ganglioside GD3 antibody (R24) immunoprecipitated the Src family kinase Lyn from the rat cerebellum, and R24 treatment of primary cerebellar cultures induced Lyn activation and rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of an 80-kDa protein (p80). We now report that R24 coimmunoprecipitates a 135-kDa protein (p135) from primary cerebellar cultures. Treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C revealed that p135 was glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored to the membrane. It was identified as TAG-1 by sequential immunoprecipitation with an anti-TAG-1 antibody. Antibody-mediated cross-linking of TAG-1 induced Lyn activation and rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of p80. Selective inhibitor for Src family kinases reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of p80. Sucrose density gradient analysis revealed that the TAG-1 and tyrosine-phosphorylated p80 in cerebellar cultures were present in the lipid raft fraction. These data show that TAG-1 transduces signals via Lyn to p80 in the lipid rafts of the cerebellum. Furthermore, degradation of cell-surface glycosphingolipids by endoglycoceramidase induced an alteration of TAG-1 distribution on an OptiPrep gradient and reduced the TAG-1-mediated Lyn activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of p80. These observations suggest that glycosphingolipids are involved in TAG-1-mediated signaling in lipid rafts.

Finally, mice lacking complex gangliosides exhibit axonal degeneration (14Sheikh K.A. Sun J. Liu Y. Kawai H. Crawford T.O. Proia R.L. Griffin J.W. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the ganglioside-dependent neural functions remain obscure. GSLs are known to exist in clusters and form microdomains containing cholesterol at the surface of the plasma membrane. These microdomains are variously referred to as lipid rafts, detergent-resistant membranes, detergent-insoluble glycosphingolipid-enriched domains, or caveolae membranes (15Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8116) Google Scholar, 16Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

The GSL microdomains have been implicated in signal transduction because a variety of signaling molecules, such as the Src family kinases, are associated with them. However, the precise functions of GSLs in the microdomains remain to be explored. We investigated the association of gangliosides with specific proteins in the central nervous system by coimmunoprecipitation experiments using an anti-ganglioside antibody. We previously demonstrated that anti-ganglioside GD3 antibody (R24) coimmunoprecipitates the Src family kinase Lyn from the rat cerebellum (21Kasahara K. Watanabe Y. Yamamoto T. Sanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29947-29953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). R24 treatment of primary cerebellar cultures induced Lyn activation and rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of an 80-kDa protein (p80). Furthermore, sucrose density gradient analysis showed that Lyn, in both cerebella and CHO cells transfected with Lyn cDNA, was detected in the lipid raft fraction. R24 immunoprecipitated caveolin, a caveolae marker protein, from CHO cells transfected with GD3 synthase cDNA (22Nara K. Watanabe Y. Maruyama K. Kasahara K. Nagai Y. Sanai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7952-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that GSL may regulate the functions of Lyn in lipid rafts. In the present study, we attempted to identify the cell-surface molecules involved in Lyn signaling because Lyn is a nonreceptor-type kinase, and we found that R24 coimmunoprecipitates TAG-1, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored neuronal cell adhesion molecule and that the antibody-mediated cross-linking of TAG-1 induced Lyn activation and rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of p80. Furthermore, we investigated the roles of GSLs in TAG-1 signaling. Endoglycoceramidase II and activator II (EGCase II ACT) and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) were purchased from Takara Biomedicals (Osaka, Japan) and Funakoshi (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. OptiPrep was purchased from Nycomed Pharma (Oslo, Norway). Triton X-100 and EGTA were purchased from Sigma. PP1, PP2, and PP3 were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA) and Calbiochem, respectively. The 3.1C12 mouse monoclonal IgG for rat TAG-1 was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD, National Institutes of Health, and maintained by the Department of Biological Sciences, University of Iowa. The mouse IgG3 anti-ganglioside GD3 monoclonal antibody, R24, anti-Lyn (Lyn8) monoclonal antibody, and anti-NCAM polyclonal antibody were obtained from Signet Laboratories (Dedham, MA), Wako Chemicals (Osaka, Japan), and Affinity Research Products (Mamhead, UK), respectively. The anti-caveolin polyclonal antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20), and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and Zymed Laboratories Inc.

The anti-T-cadherin polyclonal antibody (amino acids 1–20) was a gift from Dr. Eichmann (University of California, San Diego). Phosphacan was purified as described by Maeda et al.(23Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Oohira A. Noda M. Neuroscience. 1995; 67: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cerebellar granule cell cultures, 98% pure, were prepared from the cerebella of 6-day-old rats according to the method of Levi et al. (24Levi G. Aloisi F. Ciotti M.T. Thangnipon W. Kingsbury A. Balazs R. Shahar A. de Vellis J. Vernadakis A. Haber B. A Dissection and Tissue Culture Manual of Nervous System. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1989: 211-214Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the cerebella were incubated in 1% trypsin or 0.4 mg/ml dispase for 30 min at room temperature and triturated with a Pasteur pipette in 0.05% DNase until no tissue aggregates remained. Then 2.5 × 106 cells were suspended in basal Eagle's medium containing 25 mm KCl and 5% fetal bovine serum and plated onto 35-mm poly-d-lysine-coated plastic dishes. To avoid the proliferation of glial cells, 100 μm cytosine arabinoside was added 18 h after the seeding. Anti-TAG-1 serum was generated against recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli using the pET vector system from the rat TAG-1 encoding immunoglobulin domains I-II (amino acids 31–143). Based on the sequence information of the rat TAG-1 cDNA, two degenerate oligonucleotides were synthesized. The sequences of the 5′ and 3′ primers were 5′-TCATATGCAGGGAACCCCAGCTACCTTTGG-3′ and 5′-TGAGGAGCCAGCGGTAGGACAAACC-3′. For PCR amplification, first strand cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA of rat brain. Thirty cycles (94 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s) were run. The PCR product, around 400 base pairs in length, was subcloned into the pCR II vector, and theNdeI-BamHI fragment was inserted into the pET-3b vector (Novagen). The protein was expressed in E. coliBL21(DE3)pLysS after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and then partially purified as inclusion bodies. After SDS-PAGE, the recombinant protein was eluted electrophoretically from the gel. Aliquots containing about 1 mg of the protein were emulsified with complete or incomplete Freund's adjuvant and used to immunize rabbits. Anti-contactin/F3 serum was generated against recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli using the pET vector system from rat contactin/F3 encoding immunoglobulin domains I–II (amino acids 22–255). Based on the sequence information of rat contactin/F3 cDNA, two degenerate oligonucleotides were synthesized. The sequences of the 5′ and 3′ primers were 5′-ATACATATGTTTACATGGCACAGAAGATAT-3′ and 5′-AGATCTGAATTCATGGTGTATATGTCCTTG-3′. For PCR amplification, first strand cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA of rat brain. Thirty cycles (94 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s) were run. The PCR product, around 680 base pairs in length, was subcloned into the pCRII vector, and theNdeI-BamHI fragment was inserted into the pET-3b vector. Aliquots containing about 1 mg of the protein were emulsified with complete or incomplete Freund's adjuvant and used to immunize rabbits. Primary cerebellar cultures were labeled with the EXPRE35S35S Protein Labeling Mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 3 h in a methionine-/cysteine-depleted medium, at a final concentration of 0.1 mCi/ml. The cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 20 min. The postnuclear supernatants were collected after centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 3 min. Aliquots (0.5 ml, 750 μg of protein) of the supernatants were precleared with protein G-Sepharose (7.5 μl) and then incubated with the anti-GD3 antibody, R24 (2.5 μg), for 1 h and precipitated with protein G-Sepharose (7.5 μl). Following immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and after the addition of the Laemmli sample buffer, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) followed by autoradiography. In the sequential immunoprecipitation experiment, the immunoprecipitates were boiled for 5 min in lysis buffer with 1% SDS, diluted 10-fold with lysis buffer, and then reimmunoprecipitated with anti-GPI-anchored protein antibodies. Primary cerebellar cells, 5 × 106, were washed with PBS. To the cells in 0.5 ml of PBS were added 100 μl of lactoperoxidase (1 units/ml in PBS) and 500 μCi of Na125I at room temperature. The reaction was started by the addition of 1 μl of freshly prepared 0.0015% H2O2. The diluted H2O2 was added at 1-min intervals over 4 min. To terminate the reaction, an equal volume of 1 mg/ml tyrosine in PBS was added. For PI-PLC treatment, the surface-labeled cells were washed with PBS and incubated in a medium containing 2.5 units/ml PI-PLC fromBacillus thuringiensis for 1 h at 37 °C. Cerebellar cultures of 3 days in vitro in a 35-mm dish were incubated with 20 μg/ml anti-TAG-1 monoclonal antibody (3.1C12) on ice for 30 min in BSA medium (culture medium without fetal bovine serum containing 1% BSA and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)). After washing with cold BSA medium, the cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml anti-mouse IgG affinity-purified polyclonal antibody (secondary antibody) in BSA medium at 37 °C for the indicated times on the dish. After washing with ice-cold PBS, lysates were prepared in 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 3 min, the supernatants were incubated with the anti-Lyn antibody and precipitated with protein G-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were incubated with kinase buffer containing 10 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol). Kinase activity was measured by in vitroautophosphorylation. For cross-linking of ganglioside GD3, cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml R24 on ice for 30 min in BSA medium. After washing with cold BSA medium, the cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml anti-mouse IgG affinity-purified polyclonal antibody in BSA medium at 37 °C for 3 min. For cross-linking of NMDA receptors, cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml anti-NMDA receptor antibody on ice for 30 min in BSA medium. After washing with cold BSA medium, the cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml anti-rabbit IgG affinity-purified polyclonal antibody (secondary antibody) in BSA medium at 37 °C for 3 min. Alternatively, cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml anti-NMDA receptor antibody in BSA medium at 37 °C for 3 min. For mock cross-linking of TAG-1 or ganglioside GD3, cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml normal mouse IgG on ice for 30 min in BSA medium. After washing with cold BSA medium, the cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml anti-mouse IgG affinity-purified polyclonal antibody in BSA medium at 37 °C for 3 min. For mock cross-linking of NMDA receptors, cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml normal rabbit IgG on ice for 30 min in BSA medium. After washing with cold BSA medium, the cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml anti-rabbit IgG affinity-purified polyclonal antibody (secondary antibody) in BSA medium at 37 °C for 3 min. Two methods were used for the phosphacan-mediated stimulation. For method 1, the cerebellar cultures were incubated with 10 μg/ml phosphacan in BSA medium at 37 °C for 3 min. For method 2, the cerebellar cultures were incubated with 10 μg/ml phosphacan in BSA medium on ice for 30 min. After washing with cold BSA medium, the cells were incubated with a 10-fold concentrated culture supernatant of hybridoma 6B4 (anti-phosphacan) (25Maeda N. Matsui F. Oohira A. Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 564-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) at 37 °C for 3 min. As a negative control experiment, the cells were incubated with the concentrated 6B4 supernatant at 37 °C for 3 min without phosphacan pretreatment. For the detection of tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins, cells were lysed with lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p80 was quantified by densitometry. Membrane fractions were prepared from newborn rat cerebella. The cerebella were homogenized in ice-cold buffer A (0.32m sucrose, 1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 0.1 mm EDTA) using a Teflon motor-driven glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 900 × g for 1 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 11,500 × g for 3 min. The resulting pellet of the rat brain or the centrifuged cultured cells was solubilized in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A) at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatants were collected after centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 3 min. Aliquots (0.5 ml, 750 μg of protein) of the supernatants were precleared with protein G-Sepharose (7.5 μl), then incubated with anti-TAG-1 antibody or R24 (2.5 μg) for 1 h, and precipitated with protein G-Sepharose (7.5 μl). Following immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, once with kinase buffer (30 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mmMnCl2), and then resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer. The reaction was started by the addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Phosphorylation was stopped by the addition of the Laemmli sample buffer, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. We used normal mouse IgG, anti-NMDA receptor antibody, and anti-integrin β5 antibody as negative controls. TAG-1 distribution on a density gradient was investigated by three different methods. Sucrose gradient analysis with sodium carbonate was performed according to a method described previously (26Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Rat primary cerebellar cultures in a 35-mm dish were homogenized using a Teflon glass homogenizer and sonicated in 2 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate at pH 11.0. The sucrose content in the homogenate was then adjusted to 45% by the addition of 90% sucrose in MBS (25 mm MES (pH 6.5), 0.15 mNaCl). A linear sucrose gradient (5–35%) in 6 ml of MBS containing 250 mm sodium carbonate was layered over the lysate. The gradients were centrifuged for 16–20 h at 39,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Hitachi RPS40T rotor. 10 × 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. Sucrose gradient analysis with Triton X-100 was performed according to a method described previously (27Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar). The cells were homogenized using a Teflon glass homogenizer in 2 ml of TNE/Triton X-100 buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EGTA). The sucrose content in the homogenate was then adjusted to 40% by the addition of 80% sucrose. A linear sucrose gradient (5–30%) in 6 ml of TNE without Triton X-100 was layered over the lysate. The gradients were centrifuged for 16–20 h at 39,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Hitachi RPS40T rotor. 10 × 1 ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. OptiPrep gradient analysis was performed according to a previously described method with some modifications (28Smart E. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The cells were homogenized using a Teflon glass homogenizer and a sonicator in 2 ml of buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tricine (pH 7.8)). The OptiPrep content in the homogenate was then adjusted to 25% by the addition of 50% OptiPrep in buffer A. A linear OptiPrep gradient (10–20%) in 6 ml of buffer A was layered over the lysate. The gradients were centrifuged for 16–20 h at 39,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Hitachi RPS40T rotor. 10 × 1 ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. After trichloroacetic acid precipitation of each fraction, TAG-1 was detected by immunoblotting using the anti-TAG-1 polyclonal antibody. Caveolin in CHO cells was used as a marker protein of the lipid raft fraction, because caveolin was not detected in rat cerebellar cultures. After CHO cells in a 35-mm dish were subjected to density gradient analysis, caveolin in each fraction was detected by immunoblotting using an anti-caveolin polyclonal antibody. Distribution of tyrosine phosphorylation of p80 was investigated by sucrose density gradient with Triton X-100. After antibody-mediated cross-linking of TAG-1 or GD3 in cerebellar cultures in five 35-mm dishes, the Triton X-100 extracts were subjected to density gradient analysis. For the detection of the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins, each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. EGCase II ACT (1 units/ml EGCase II, 0.5 mm activator II) was diluted with the culture medium and applied to the culture at 2–3 days in vitro at a final concentration of 2 to 60 milliunits/ml (EGCase) and 1–30 μm (activator). To investigate the reversibility of the EGCase effect, the cells were washed and cultured with the conditioned medium after the EGCase treatment. Heat-inactivated EGCase was prepared by boiling for 5 min. The colorimetric assay of cell viability was performed using MTT according to the manufacturer's instructions (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). We investigated the EGCase effect on the following: 1) cell-surface ganglioside GD3 expression; 2) Lyn activation by TAG-1 cross-linking; 3) tyrosine phosphorylation of p80 by TAG-1 or GD3 cross-linking; 4) cell morphology; 5) cell viability; and 6) TAG-1 distribution on density gradient. After treatment with EGCase, the rat primary cerebellar cultures were harvested. The cells were first treated with R24, then with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody, and analyzed on a FACSCalibur (Becton-Dickinson). The immunoprecipitate obtained with the anti-GD3 antibody (R24) from the Triton X-100 extract of rat primary cerebellar cultures metabolically labeled with [35S] methionine was analyzed by autoradiography. R24 coimmunoprecipitated two proteins of 135 and 16 kDa, as revealed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). This observation suggests that ganglioside GD3 associates with these two proteins. 125I surface labeling and immunoprecipitation with R24 were performed to investigate whether or not the 135-kDa protein (p135) was a surface protein. p135, but not the 16-kDa protein, was also coprecipitated with R24 from the surface-labeled cells (Fig.2 A). The appearance of another smaller band was possibly due to the degradation of p135 by trypsin during cell culture, since the cell surface was labeled 12 h after trypsinization.Figure 2p135 is surface-labeled and released by PI-PLC treatment of primary cerebellar cultures. A, primary cerebellar cultures whose p135 was surface-labeled with125I were solubilized in lysis buffer.

PI-PLC treatment released p135 from the cell surface (Fig. 2 B, lane 2) into the culture medium (Fig. 2 B, lane 3), indicating that p135 is a GPI-anchored protein. p135 was identified as the GPI-anchored neuronal cell adhesion molecule, TAG-1, by sequential immunoprecipitation with R24 and the anti-TAG-1 antibody. Immunoprecipitation with R24 was performed using cerebellar cultures metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, after which the immune complexes were disrupted by boiling in SDS-containing buffer (Fig.3, lane 5) and subjected to second immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for GPI-anchored neuronal cell adhesion molecules, i.e. TAG-1, contactin/F3, NCAM, and T-cadherin. The anti-TAG-1 polyclonal antibody, but not anti-contactin/F3, anti-NCAM, anti-T-cadherin antibodies, specifically precipitated p135 in the re-immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 3,lane 1). To examine the possibility of TAG-1-mediated signal transduction via Lyn, we measured the Lyn activity in cerebellar cultures after antibody-mediated cross-linking of TAG-1. Triton X-100 extracts were prepared from cerebellar cultures, which were sequentially treated with the anti-TAG-1 monoclonal antibody for 30 min on ice and secondary antibody for the indicated time at 37 °C. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with the anti-Lyn antibody. Kinase activity was measured by in vitro autophosphorylation. Treatment with the secondary antibody resulted in a rapid (within 1 min) and significant (3.5-fold) increase in Lyn activity (Fig.4, lanes 1–5). The possible increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins as a result of antibody-mediated cross-linking of TAG-1 was investigated. After SDS-PAGE, phosphotyrosines were detected by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Treatment with the secondary antibody induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, including the prominent phosphorylation of p80 (Fig.5 A). The phosphorylation peaked at 2 min and returned to the control level at 20 min. Treatment with the anti-TAG-1 monoclonal antibody only at 37 °C, even at 100 μg/ml, resulted in no change in tyrosine phosphorylation of p80 (data not shown). p80 was also phosphorylated by antibody-mediated cross-linking of ganglioside GD3 (Fig. 5 B). Mock cross-linking with normal mouse IgG and antibody-mediated cross-linking of NMDA receptor did not induce increase in Lyn activity (Fig. 4,lanes 6 and 7) and protein tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5 D). Phosphacan, a neural tissue-specific chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, is known to be one of the high affinity ligands of TAG-1 (29Milev P. Maurel P. Häring M. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol.

We have recently shown that METH-1 protein is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that secreted human pro-METH-1 is processed in two consecutive steps to release both p87 and p65 active forms. The p87 form lacks the N-terminal prodomain and p65 results from an additional processing event in the C-terminal end. Generation of p87 was blocked with specific inhibitors of furin, and incubation of pro-METH-1 with purified furin released the p87 fragment but not p65. Generation of p65 required preformation of p87 and was suppressed by inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases. We demonstrate that matrix metalloproteases 2, 8, and 15 were able to release p65 when p87 was used as substrate. This second processing step removes two thrombospondin repeats from the carboxyl-terminal end of p87-METH-1 and alters the affinity of the protein to heparin and endothelial cultures. Furthermore, this deletion was associated with a reduced activity upon suppression of endothelial cell proliferation. We hypothesize that METH-1 processing is relevant for the modulation of the anti-angiogenic properties displayed by the protein.

The structure of all ADAMTS members include a signal sequence for targeting to the secretory pathway, a prodomain, a catalytic motif related with the reprolysin subfamily of metalloproteases, a putative disintegrin domain, and a carboxyl-terminal region containing a variable number of type I repeats (properdin- or thrombospondin-like). Several members of this family appear to be processed upon secretion (1Vázquez F. Hastings G. Ortega M.A. Lane T.F. Oikemus S. Lombardo M. Iruela-Arispe M.L. J. Biol.

By analogy to proteins of the metalloprotease family, it is likely that this processing is required for functional activation. For example, all matrix metalloproteases (MMPs)1 are synthesized as inactive zymogens in which the amino-terminal prodomain is responsible for maintaining latency of the proteolytic activity. Activation involves removal of the prodomain by endoproteolytic cleavage that may be performed by distinct MMPs, furin, plasmin, and other proteases (10Wolfsberg T.G. White J.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the metallospondin/ADAMTS family of proteins reveals a well conserved furin consensus cleavage site between the prodomain and the catalytic motif. Furin is a ubiquitously expressed calcium-dependent serine protease that is involved in cleaving various precursor proteins (11Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). This processing has been shown to occur with a deletion mutant form of ADAMTS1 (3Kuno K. Terashima Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18821-18826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mature form of aggrecanase-1/ADAMTS4 lacks the prodomain, indicating processing at this site (6Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C. Pratta M.A. Abbaszade I. Hollis J.M. Liu R. Rosenfeld S.A. Copeland R.A. Decicco C.P. Wynn R. Rockwell A. Yang F. Duke J.L. Solomon K. George H. Bruckner R. Nagase H. Itoh Y. Ellis D.M. Ross H. Wiswall B.H. Murphy K. Hillman Jr., M.C. Hollis G.F. Newton R.C. Magolda R.L. Trzaskos J.M. Arner E.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1664-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). In addition to removal of the prodomain, secondary processing can also take place and may also be important for activity. Recent studies on aggrecanase-1/ADAMTS4 suggest the possibility that a C-terminal fragment of this protein may function as a competitor for the activity of the mature enzyme (12Tortorella M. Pratta M. Liu R.-Q. Abbaszade I. Ross H. Burn T. Arner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25791-25797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Also, active forms of aggrecanase-2/ADAMTS5 were identified as 64- and 50-kDa fragments. These forms are smaller than the predicted protein (∼75-kDa) that should result upon sole removal of the prodomain (7Abbaszade I. Liu R. Yang F. Rosenfeld S.A. Ross H. Link J.R. Ellis D.M. Tortorella M.D. Pratta M.A. Hollis J.M. Wynn R. Duke J.L. George H. Hillman Jr., M.C. Murphy K. Wiswall B.H. Copeland R.A. Decicco C.P. Bruckner R. Nagase H. Itoh Y. Newton R.C. Magolda R.L.

Finally, processed forms of METH-1 and METH-2 resulting from expression of the full-length cDNAs have been shown to display angio-inhibitory activity (1Vázquez F. Hastings G. Ortega M.A. Lane T.F. Oikemus S. Lombardo M. Iruela-Arispe M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23349-23357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Regulation of these proteolytic events is directly relevant to the mechanism of action of these proteins and their capacity to interact with cells and extracellular matrix molecules. METH-1 and METH-2 are the only metallospondin/ADAMTS members for which anti-angiogenic properties have been attributed (1Vázquez F. Hastings G. Ortega M.A. Lane T.F. Oikemus S. Lombardo M. Iruela-Arispe M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23349-23357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis represents a complex process that requires the presence and activation of a wide variety of molecules, including growth factors, extracellular matrix components, receptors, and proteolytic enzymes (13Folkman J. D'Amore P.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1153-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Metallospondins display several structural features that could play a role in the regulation of the angiogenic cascade. They exhibit potential proteolytic activities and can be targeted to specific extracellular sites via disintegrin and TSP motifs. In this study, we demonstrate that the processing of METH-1/ADAMTS1 involves two different proteolytic events that affect localization, binding to the extracellular matrix, and activity of the protein. Full-length METH-1 cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA).METH-1 934Myc was cloned by digestion of full-length construct with DraI and religation on pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(−)B previously blunt-ended with EcoRV. This construct contains a functional Myc-His carboxyl tag. Truncated METH-1 (METH-1 744Myc ) was cloned by removing the 3′-end of full-length METH-1 at the BamHI restriction site (position 2464, amino acid 744) and by religation using aBamHI site located on the pcDNA3.1 polylinker. The cDNA encoding AT-EK1 was inserted inEcoRI/ApaI-linearized pcDNA3. 2E. K. Dufour, J. B. Denault, and R. Leduc, manuscript in preparation. Recombinant protein from stable 293T line expressing METH-1 was collected after a 36-h incubation in serum-free medium. For experiments involving transient transfections, cells were maintained in serum-containing medium for 24 h and then switched to serum-free medium for 36–48 h to isolate cell lysates and conditioned medium. To obtain p87, cultures were treated with heparin (5 μg/ml) (Sigma) in serum-free medium. Purification of recombinant METH-1 protein included heparin and Zn2+-chelate affinity chromatography. For heparin purification, conditioned medium was passed through heparin Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) columns, washed and eluted with increasing concentrations of NaCl (500 mm to 2m). Zn2+-chelate affinity chromatography was performed using HiTrap chelating columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Binding of Zn2+ and equilibration of the column was performed following the manufacturer's recommendations. Bound proteins were eluted with increasing concentrations of NaCl and NH4Cl or directly with EDTA. Specific binding to Zn2+ has been verified by using alternative cations chelated to the same resin. Further purification was achieved by 10–20% sucrose gradient centrifugation. Final separation and purity was assessed by immunoblot analysis and gel staining with GelCode® (Pierce). Concentration of protein was determined using theDC protein assay (Bio-Rad) and by reading at 280 nm. The construction, expression, and purification of the serpin variant AT-EK1 was performed as described previously (14Dufour E.K. Denault J.B. Hopkins P.C. Leduc R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNA encoding histidine-tagged AT-EK1 was subcloned in the prokaryotic expression vector pQE-31 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Transformed BL21 cells were grown at 30 °C in TB medium, and expression was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were lysed, and purification was performed using a combination of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and fast protein liquid chromatography. Purity was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 293T, bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC), and human dermal fibroblast were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. RPE.40 cells (a generous gift from Dr. Gary Ward, University of Vermont) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfections were performed with calcium phosphate for 293T cells and with Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for RPE.40 cells. Stable transfections with 293T cells were performed with calcium phosphate by co-transfection of METH-1 constructs and pLSHL-Hygro (Invitrogen) for further selection with hygromycin. Conditioned medium from RPE.40 cells transiently transfected with METH-1 was concentrated with Amicon filters (Beverly, MA) and reconstituted in the following buffer: 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2. The digestion was performed at 37 °C with 1.4 μg/ml of purified recombinant furin as described previously (15Denault J.B. Claing A. D'Orleans-Juste P. Sawamura T. Kido T. Masaki T. Leduc R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Reaction was stopped by the addition of 2× sample buffer (0.1 m Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue, and 0.7m β-mercaptoethanol) and analyzed by immunoblot. Stable 293T cells expressing METH-1 were plated on 12- or 24-well plates. At 70% confluence, cells were rinsed and incubated with fresh serum-free medium in the presence or absence of different inhibitors. Conditioned medium was collected 36 h later, except for TIMP treatment when the medium was collected at 18 h, and analyzed for the presence of METH-1 by immunoblot. Proteinase inhibitors included (a) the furin inhibitor AT-EK1 (14Dufour E.K. Denault J.B. Hopkins P.C. Leduc R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); (b) the MMP inhibitors doxycycline, minocycline and MMP inhibitor I (Calbiochem), TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 (Chemicon International; Temecula, CA), and 1,10-phenanthroline and EDTA (Sigma); and (c) aprotinin (Sigma), a broad spectrum serine-protease inhibitor. Purified p87-METH-1 protein or conditioned medium containing p87-METH-1 was treated withp-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) (Sigma) or the indicated MMPs (Chemicon International). Prior to incubation with METH-1, MMP1, MMP3, and MMP8 were activated with APMA for 1 h at 37 °C. Other MMPs were already activated (MMP2 and MMP9), or in the case of membrane-anchored MMPs (MMP14 (MT1-MMP), MMP15 (MT2-MMP), MMP16 (MT3-MMP), and MMP17 (MT4-MMP)), the forms used corresponded to the catalytic domain. Treatment was carried out for 16–18 h at 37 °C. Samples were analyzed by immunoblot. Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were incubated with polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant METH-1 (1Vázquez F. Hastings G. Ortega M.A. Lane T.F. Oikemus S. Lombardo M. Iruela-Arispe M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23349-23357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). After incubation with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, signal was detected by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal kit; Pierce). Conditioned medium from stable 293T cells expressing the METH-1934Myc construct was collected, and the C-terminal fragment containing the Myc-His tag was purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). Bound proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in Tricine gels and transferred to Sequi-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) using CAPS buffer (10 mm3-cyclohexylamino-1-propanesulfonic acid, pH 11). Proteins were visualized by staining with Ponceau S (0.2% solution in 1% acetic acid); excised fragments were sent for sequencing. Samples were N-terminally sequenced on an Applied Biosystems Procise Protein Sequencer using standard Edman chemistry. Quiescent BAEC were trypsinized and plated onto 24-well dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% fetal calf serum, 2 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor-2, and 50 ng/ml vascular endothelial growth factor, in the presence or absence of recombinant METH-1 protein. A pulse of [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well) was added during the last 8 h prior to harvesting. Cells were washed and treated in 10% trichloroacetic acid. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine was determined by scintillation counting, as described previously (16Iruela-Arispe M.L. Sage E.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 52: 414-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Quiescent BAEC and human dermal fibroblast were trypsinized and plated onto six-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% fetal calf serum, 2 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor-2, and 50 ng/ml vascular endothelial growth factor, in the presence or absence of recombinant METH-1 protein. After 48 h of treatment, conditioned medium was concentrated using heparin Sepharose CL-6B, and dishes were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell layer was extracted directly with loading buffer. The presence of METH-1 in conditioned medium and cell layer samples was assessed by immunoblot analysis. We have previously described the anti-angiogenic effects of a processed form of METH-1 (p65), suggesting that cleavage of the unprocessed protein is required for the generation of a functionally active and stable form (1Vázquez F. Hastings G. Ortega M.A. Lane T.F. Oikemus S. Lombardo M. Iruela-Arispe M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23349-23357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). To characterize the events involved in METH-1 processing, we transfected human kidney 293T cells with an expression vector containing the completeMETH-1 cDNA. Cell layer and conditioned medium were analyzed for the presence of METH-1 fragments by immunoblot analysis. Using a METH-1 antibody, we detected a 110-kDa form of METH-1 (p110) in the cell layer (Fig. 1 B). This form corresponds to the unprocessed pro-METH-1 (Fig. 1 A). When we examined the conditioned medium, three METH-1 species (110, 87, and 65 kDa) were detected. By analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of METH-1, the 87-kDa fragment (p87) would correspond to a mature form following the removal of the prodomain alone. The smaller 65-kDa fragment (p65) was consistently the most predominant form detected in the medium. p65 appeared to result from a second proteolytic event. We also detected both p110 and p87 forms associated with the ECM, but the levels were significantly reduced compared with those in the cell layer (data not shown). To gain insight into the presence of specific domains in the processed forms of METH-1, we used heparin and Zn2+-chelate affinity chromatography. For ADAMTS1 it has been determined that all of the TSP motifs found at the C terminus of the protein are important for heparin binding (17Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and are likely to be the sites that confer heparin affinity to METH-1. Purification of conditioned medium containing METH-1 by heparin affinity chromatography revealed different affinities for each one of the processed forms (Fig.2 A). Using a continuous salt gradient (NaCl), the first form to be eluted was p65 (at 450 mm NaCl). Subsequently, p87 and p110 eluted at considerably higher salt concentration (800 mm NaCl) (Fig.2 B). The lower affinity of p65 for heparin was an indication that a portion of the carboxyl end of METH-1 containing all or some of the TSP repeats had been removed. METH-1/ADAMTS1 contains a consensus zinc binding motif (HELGHVFNMPHD), which defines the metalloprotease domain. To evaluate the presence of this Zn2+ binding site in the three METH-1 forms, we subjected heparin-purified fractions to affinity chromatography on HiTrap-Zn2+ columns. Metal chelate affinity chromatography has been used previously to purify metalloproteases (18Van der Stappen J.W. Hendriks T. de Man B.M. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 725-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 19Matsuo C. Fukao H. Matsuo O. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 134: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) based on their ability to coordinate to metal ions. All forms of METH-1 were capable of binding the HiTrap resin, suggesting that the Zn2+ binding motif is present (Fig. 2 C). These results indicate that the processing events described occur at both upstream and downstream positions of the core protein that maintains the metalloprotease domain. It has been shown that furin plays an important role in maturational processing of a diverse group of precursor enzymes. Most often, pro-protein cleavage by furin occurs in the trans-Golgi network, but recent studies have demonstrated that the enzyme can contribute to extracellular processing as well (11Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Like other members of the metallospondin family, METH-1 contains a consensus furin cleavage sequence (RKKR235). Furthermore, cleavage of the mouse ortholog ADAMTS1 has been shown to be impaired in LoVo cells, which are furin-deficient (3Kuno K. Terashima Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18821-18826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This processing was restored when LoVo cells were transfected with furin expression constructs. To investigate the location and timing of a furin-like cleavage event in METH-1, we analyzed whether pro-METH-1 processing was inhibited when the furin inhibitor AT-EK1 was co-expressed. The AT-EK1 molecule is a mutant serpin derived from the previously characterized furin inhibitor AT-PDX (14Dufour E.K. Denault J.B. Hopkins P.C. Leduc R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) but where the reactive site has a RIRR sequence resembling the RKKR cleavage of METH-1.2 These inhibitors function by irreversibly binding to furin and abolishing the enzyme's proteolytic activity. When 293T cells were co-transfected with METH-1 and increasing concentrations of AT-EK1 expression construct, all processing of p110-METH-1 was blocked (Fig. 3 A). We deduced that furin inhibition mediated by AT-EK1 directly affected p110 cleavage and that the first processing step was essential to enable the second catalytic event that generates p65-METH-1. To extend these results, we examined processing of METH-1 in RPE.40 cells. These cells are a mutant Chinese hamster ovary K1 strain lacking furin activity (20Spence M.J. Sucic J.F. Foley B.T. Moehring T.J. Somat. Cell. Mol. Genet. 1995; 21: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). When RPE.40 cells were transfected with the full-length METH-1 cDNA, only unprocessed p110-METH-1 was detected (Fig. 3 B). To determine whether furin was responsible for the cleavage of p110 to p87, in vitro digestion experiments were performed by incubating recombinant furin with p110-METH-1 from transfected RPE.40 cells. Complete proteolytic processing to p87 was detected after 25 min of incubation. However, no additional processing events followed, even at longer incubation times (Fig. 3 C). Taken together, the data suggest that furin mediates the conversion of p110 to p87 and that the second processing event to p65 requires an additional and independent proteolytic pathway. Finally, we performed experiments involving treatment of METH-1-producing 293T cells with the recombinant furin inhibitor AT-EK1. Fig. 3 D shows that the addition of as little as 6 ng/ml AT-EK1 to the medium was sufficient to block processing of p110 pro-METH-1. Indeed, we noticed decreased levels of both p87 and p65 forms. These results together with the absence of processed forms in the cell lysate suggested that furin cleavage of METH-1 is likely to occur late in the secretory pathway or at the cell surface. The results shown above demonstrate two independent and sequential processing events. The first was furin-mediated and occurred at the boundary of the prodomain and the metalloprotease domain of METH-1. Based on our previous results that indicated decreased binding of p65-METH-1 to heparin (Fig.2 A), we hypothesized that this form lacks one or more TSP repeats located at the C terminus, since these repeats have been shown to confer affinity for heparin (17Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To verify that the second cleavage event occurs at the C-terminal end, we analyzed the processing of a METH-1 construct containing a functional Myc tag at the caboxyl-terminal end (METH-1934Myc). This construct lacks the last 16 amino acids of full-length METH-1 yet includes all three TSP repeats (Fig.4 A). Cell layer and conditioned medium of 293T cells stably transfected with this construct were analyzed by immunoblot with specific antibodies for the Myc tag and METH-1 (Fig. 4 B). The cell layer presented a unique band that corresponded to the unprocessed METH-1 (p110). As expected, this form was recognized by both Myc and METH-1 antibodies. The analysis of the conditioned medium showed distinct patterns when each antibody was used. Using the METH-1 antibody, we identified p87 and p65 fragments that corresponded to the described processed forms of METH-1. The Myc antibody recognized p87 but not p65, confirming that this second fragment results from a second processing event at the C-terminal end. The Myc antibody also detected a C-terminal fragment (∼22 kDa) that resulted from the cleavage of p87. To further elucidate the second processing step, we generated a truncated METH-1 form (METH-1744Myc) by introducing a Myc tag stop cassette at amino acid 744 and thereby removing the last two TSP repeats and part of the spacer region of native METH-1 (Fig.4 A). Transfection of this construct in 293T cells resulted in the detection of an unprocessed form (∼90 kDa) in the cell layer (data not shown) and two proteolytic products of 70 kDa (TR.1) and 65 kDa (TR.2) in the conditioned medium (Fig. 4 C) that appear to recapitulate the same processing events displayed by full-length METH-1. TR.1 and TR.2 would correspond to p87-like and p65-like processing events, respectively. When the same blot was probed with Myc antibody, only TR.1 was reactive. This result confirmed that the tag was removed by proteolytic cleavage at a position very close to residue 744. Finally, we were able to purify the C-terminal Myc-tagged fragment resulting from the processing of the METH-1934Myc construct (Fig. 4 B) and subsequently submitted it for N-terminal sequencing. The sequencing data showed several potential cleavage sites (at least four) between amino a"

It is comprised of two subpathways: transcription-coupled repair that accomplishes efficient removal of damage blocking transcription and global genome repair. Recently, the basic mechanism of global genome repair has emerged from biochemical studies. However, little is known about transcription-coupled repair in eukaryotes. Here we report the identification of a novel protein designated XAB2 (XPA-binding protein 2) that was identified by virtue of its ability to interact with XPA, a factor central to both nucleotide excision repair subpathways. The XAB2 protein of 855 amino acids consists mainly of 15 tetratricopeptide repeats. In addition to interacting with XPA, immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that a fraction of XAB2 is able to interact with the transcription-coupled repair-specific proteins CSA and CSB as well as RNA polymerase II. Furthermore, antibodies against XAB2 inhibited both transcription-coupled repair and transcription in vivo but not global genome repair when microinjected into living fibroblasts.

It maintains the genetic information by removing a wide variety of lesions from DNA including UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6/4 photoproducts as well as numerous chemical adducts (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Two subpathways can be discerned in NER: global genome repair (GGR) and transcription-coupled repair (TCR) (2Hanawalt P.C. Spivak G. Dizdaroglu M. Karakaya A.E. Advances in DNA Damage and Repair. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 169-179Crossref Google Scholar). Lesions that actually block transcription, such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (which are inefficiently removed by GGR), are preferentially removed from the transcribed strand of active genes by TCR to allow rapid recovery of RNA synthesis (3Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Okumoto D.S. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1985; 40: 359-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 4Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). The importance of NER is highlighted by the clinical features of rare human hereditary conditions caused by a deficiency in NER, such as xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne syndrome (CS). XP patients show striking hypersensitivity to sunlight and an extremely high incidence of skin cancer in sun-exposed areas and frequently progressive neurological degeneration. Seven genetic complementation groups of XP are known, XP-A through XP-G. In addition, an XP variant group (XP-V) is defective in postreplication repair (5Bootsma D. Kraemer K.H. Cleaver J.E. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. The Genetic Basis of Human Cancer. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1998: 245-274Google Scholar). Cells from XP-C patients are deficient only in GGR but not in TCR (6Venema J. van Hoffen A. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 7van Hoffen A. Venema J. Meschini R. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). CS patients show photohypersensitivity, cachectic dwarfism, and severe mental retardation but, unlike XP patients, no predisposition to skin cancer (8Nance M.A. Berry S.A. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1992; 42: 68-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Two genetic complementation groups exist: CS-A and CS-B. In contrast to XP-C, the defect within CS is restricted to TCR (9Venema J. Mullenders L.H. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mayne L.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4707-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 10van Hoffen A. Natarajan A.T.

To date, all of the known genes responsible for XP and CS (theXPA-XPG, XPV, CSA, andCSB genes) have been cloned (5Bootsma D. Kraemer K.H. Cleaver J.E. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. The Genetic Basis of Human Cancer. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1998: 245-274Google Scholar). Recently, the core reaction of NER in humans has been reconstitutedin vitro with purified proteins (11Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V. Podust V.N. Protic M.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the outlines of the mechanism of GGR have been elucidated (reviewed in Ref. 14de Laat W.L. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 768-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). The XPC-HR23B complex is the main factor to initiate global genome repair by sensing and binding to various types of lesion (15Sugasawa K. Ng J.M. Masutani C. Iwai S. van der Spek P.J. Eker A.P. Hanaoka F. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 223-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). The UV-DDB protein complex that is affected in XP-E patients is required for recognition of a specific subset of damage, such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (16Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The binding of XPC-HR23B complex to a lesion presumably induces a conformational change in the DNA around the injury. TFIIH, a general transcription initiation factor containing the XPB and XPD DNA helicases, is recruited to the recognized injury and locally unwinds the DNA duplex by its bidirectional DNA helicase activities to form an open reaction intermediate. XPA in a complex with replication protein A is likely to be involved in verification of the damage, proper orientation of the NER machinery around the injury, and stabilization of the opened intermediate. At the same time, replication protein A positions the structure-specific endonucleases at the appropriate sites for dual incision: XPG 2–8 bases at the 3′ side and the ERCC1-XPF complex 15–24 nucleotides 5′ of the lesion. After removal of the damage-containing 24–32-mer oligonucleotide, the resulting gap in the DNA is filled by general replication factors, and the final nick is sealed by DNA ligase (see Refs. 14de Laat W.L. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 768-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar and 17Araujo S.J. Wood R.D. Mutat. Res. 1999; 435: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar for recent reviews and specific references therein). The molecular mechanism of TCR is only resolved for Escherichia coli (18Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The Mfd gene product (containing helicase motifs but without helicase activity) has been identified as a transcription-repair coupling factor that displaces an elongating RNA polymerase blocked in front of a lesion and then recruits the UvrABCE. coli excinuclease, which accomplishes removal of the lesion. In humans, genetic and cell biological evidence indicates that CSA and CSB play a key role in TCR (9Venema J. Mullenders L.H. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mayne L.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4707-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 10van Hoffen A. Natarajan A.T. Mayne L.V. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. Venema J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5890-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), but their functions remain to be elucidated. CSA is a 44-kDa protein with WD-40 repeats, which appears to have a potential for interaction with other proteins. It has been reported that CSA interacts with CSB and the p44 subunit of TFIIHin vitro (19Henning K.A. Li L. Iyer N. McDaniel L.D. Reagan M.S. Legerski R. Schultz R.A. Stefanini M. Lehmann A.R. Mayne L.V. Friedberg E.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 555-564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). CSB is a 168-kDa protein with helicase motifs that belongs to the SWI/SNF family (20Troelstra C. van Gool A. de Wit J. Vermeulen W. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 939-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that CSB is associated with RNA polymerase II in vivo (21van Gool A.J. Citterio E. Rademakers S. van Os R. Vermeulen W. Constantinou A. Egly J.M. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5955-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and we and others have shown that CSB has a DNA-dependent ATPase activity but no detectable classical helicase activity (22Selby C.P. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11205-11209Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 23Citterio E. Rademakers S. van der Horst G.T. van Gool A.J. Hoeijmakers J.H. Vermeulen W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11844-11851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Since both CSB and Mfd contain helicase motifs, CSB may play a role equivalent to Mfd in mammalian cells. However, unlike Mfd, CSB has no detectable activity to dissociate RNA polymerase II stalled at a lesion from the DNA (24Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1885-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). It has been shown that CSB interacts with RNA polymerase II in a complex containing DNA and nascent RNA in vitro (25Tantin D. Kansal A. Carey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6803-6814Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The resulting quaternary complex has been shown to have an ability to recruit TFIIH, suggesting that CSB would recruit the NER proteins in vivo when RNA polymerase II encounters the lesion on the transcribed strand (26Tantin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27794-27799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the present study, we isolated a cDNA encoding a novel tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein, designated XAB2 (XPA-binding protein 2). We found that XAB2 associates with both TCR-specific factors CSA and CSB and with RNA polymerase II. Furthermore, microinjection of anti-XAB2 antibodies specifically inhibited transcription as well as TCR but not GGR, suggesting that XAB2 is a novel factor participating in TCR and transcription itself. Screening of a HeLa cDNA library for isolating cDNAs encoding XPA binding proteins was performed using the yeast two-hybrid system as described (27Matsuda T. Saijo M. Kuraoka I. Kobayashi T. Nakatsu Y. Nagai A. Enjoji T. Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Hanaoka F. Yasui A. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4152-4157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Positive transformants were classified into several groups based on cross-hybridization. Out of 281 positive clones, 54 belonged to the group of XAB2. To obtain full-length cDNA of XAB2, we screened a HeLa cDNA library in λ ZAP II (provided by Dr. H. Nojima, Osaka University) using the 939-base pair SmaI fragment of XAB2 cDNA as a probe. In addition, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed with 5′-AmpliFINDER RACE KIT (CLONTECH) using the P1 primer (5′-TTCATAGGCAGGGTCGGTCACACAG-3′) and P2 primer (5′-TGTGCCCGACGCGCCTTCAGGTATC-3′) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. The full-length cDNA of XAB2 was reconstructed in pBluescript SK(−) by insertion of theEcoRI–KpnI fragment from the rapid amplification of cDNA ends product into the EcoRI and KpnI sites of the cDNA from the HeLa λ Zap library screenings. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST)-XPA fusion protein was prepared as described previously (27Matsuda T. Saijo M. Kuraoka I. Kobayashi T. Nakatsu Y. Nagai A. Enjoji T. Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Hanaoka F. Yasui A. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4152-4157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). GST-XAB2 fusion protein was obtained by in-frame cloning the full-length XAB2 cDNA into pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Referring to the published data (19Henning K.A. Li L. Iyer N. McDaniel L.D. Reagan M.S. Legerski R. Schultz R.A. Stefanini M. Lehmann A.R. Mayne L.V. Friedberg E.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 555-564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), the CSA cDNA was isolated from WI38 VA13 cells with RT-PCR using an upper primer (5′-CGAATTCTCGAGGATATGCTGGGGTTTTTGTC-3′) with anEcoRI site and a lower primer (5′-TTGGTCGACTCTGTTTTAGGATTTTATGCAAA-3′) with a SalI site. The amplified product was digested with EcoRI andSalI and inserted into pBluescript SK(−) and pGEX-5X-2 forin vitro translation and GST fusion protein, respectively.In vitro translation of proteins and pull-down assays using GST, GST-XAB2, or GST-CSA fusion protein were performed as described (27Matsuda T. Saijo M. Kuraoka I. Kobayashi T. Nakatsu Y. Nagai A. Enjoji T. Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Hanaoka F. Yasui A. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4152-4157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Two antisera were prepared. Anti-XAB2FL was raised against the full-length recombinant XAB2, obtained using BAC-to-BAC Baculovirus Expression System (Life Technologies, Inc.). TheEcoRI–XhoI fragment containing the full-length cDNA of XAB2 was inserted into pFASTBAC1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) plasmid, and then the recombinant baculoviruses were obtained by following the instruction manual. Sf9 cells (1 × 108 cells) were infected with the recombinant baculoviruses at 27 °C at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5. After 3 days of incubation, cells were harvested and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in NETN buffer (150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin), and the suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. Almost all of the recombinant XAB2 were recovered in the pellet. After washed with NETN buffer, the pellet was dissolved in SDS sample buffer and then applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 7% polyacrylamide gel. To visualize the recombinant XAB2, the gel was stained with CBB-R250 and destained in water. The gel stripe containing the recombinant XAB2 was cut out and used for immunization. Anti-XAB2C was raised against the C-terminal part (amino acid residues 694–855) of XAB2, overproduced as a GST fusion product in E. coli. TheBglII–XhoI fragment of XAB2 cDNA was inserted into BamHI and XhoI sites of pGEX-5X-2. The GST fusion C-terminal 162 amino acids of XAB2 were purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in NETN buffer. To examine the interactions of XAB2 with CSA, we used the SV40-transformed CS-A fibroblast line CS3BE-SV and CS3BE-SV(dtCSA) cells. CS3BE-SV expressed no endogenous CSA, while CS3BE-SV(dtCSA) stably expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-/His6-double-tagged CSA at physiological levels showed a normal UV sensitivity. 2E. Citterio, unpublished results. Whole cell extracts (WCE) of these cells were prepared with NETN buffer as described previously (27Matsuda T. Saijo M. Kuraoka I. Kobayashi T. Nakatsu Y. Nagai A.

The WCE (4 mg) was incubated with 5 μg of anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (12CA5) at 4 °C for 12 h. The immunocomplexes were subsequently precipitated with 40 μl (bed volume) of Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After extensive washing with NETN buffer, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. To examine the interactions of XAB2 with CSB, the SV40-transformed CS1AN-SV (2tCSB) cell line (stably expressing functional and physiological levels of HA-/His6-double-tagged CSB) and HeLa cells were used for preparing Manley's WCE as described previously (21van Gool A.J.

The WCE (4 mg) was incubated with 5 μg of anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (12CA5) at 4 °C for 6 h. The protein-antibody complexes were subsequently bound to Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After extensive washing with buffer A (25 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), bound proteins were eluted by incubation with a synthetic HA-peptide (YPYDVPDYA) at 1 mg/ml in buffer A. For co-immunoprecipitation of XAB2 with RNA polymerase II, HeLa WCE (4 mg), prepared with NETN, was incubated with anti-RNA polymerase II mouse monoclonal antibody (8WG16; a kind gift from Dr. J-M. Egly, CNRS/INSERM/Université Louis Pasteur) or anti-XAB2FL at 4 °C for 12 h. The immunocomplexes were purified in NETN buffer as described above, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. The proteins in the eluates (immunoprecipitated fractions) were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblot analyses. The WCEs (20 μg) were also subjected to immunoblot analyses with the immunoprecipitated fractions. Anti-HA rat monoclonal antibody (3F10) was used to detect HA-tagged CSA and CSB. Microinjections were performed into homopolykaryons of DNA repair-proficient control primary fibroblasts (C5RO) and XP21RO (XP-C) cells obtained after cell fusion as described (21van Gool A.J. Citterio E. Rademakers S. van Os R. Vermeulen W. Constantinou A. Egly J.M. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5955-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). NER activity (unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS)) was measured 24 h after injection. After microinjection, cells were UV-irradiated at 15 J/m2 and then subjected to a 2-h incubation in culture medium containing [3H]thymidine (20 μCi/ml; specific activity, 120 Ci/mmol) washed with PBS, fixed, and processed for autoradiography. Recovery of RNA synthesis (RRS) after UV irradiation was determined as follows. 24 h after injection, cells were exposed to 15 J/m2 of UV light, incubated for an additional 24 h in normal culture medium, washed with PBS, and subsequently incubated for another 1 h in culture medium containing [3H]uridine (10 μCi/ml; specific activity, 50 Ci/mmol), fixed, and processed for autoradiography. Overall normal RNA synthesis (transcription) was determined, 48 h after injection as described above for RRS but without prior UV irradiation. UDS, RRS, and transcription levels were quantified by counting the autoradiographically induced silver grains above the nuclei (at least 100 nuclei). The relative levels of repair and transcription in the injected cells were obtained by dividing the mean grain count number by the number of grains above the nuclei of surrounding noninjected cells. To identify protein interactions within NER and/or with other nuclear constituents, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with XPA as a bait (27Matsuda T. Saijo M. Kuraoka I. Kobayashi T. Nakatsu Y.

In addition to previously identified XPA-interacting NER proteins (such as ERCC1 (28Li L. Elledge S.J. Peterson C.A. Bales E.S. Legerski R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The specific interaction of XPA and XAB2 in yeast (Fig.1 A) was confirmed by in vitro pull-down assays using GST-XPA fusion protein and in vitro translated XAB2 (Fig. 1 B). Sequencing of the complete cDNA (reconstructed after 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends; see “Experimental Procedures”) revealed a predicted acidic protein (pI 5.8) of 855 amino acids containing three stretches of acidic residues (Figs. 2 and3 A). Sequence homology searches using NCBI PSI-BLAST to match the XAB2 sequence against sequences in nonredundant protein data bases revealed three apparent homologs of Drosophila melanogaster (ORF of CG6197, accession number AAF58348; 60.6% identical), Caenorhabditis elegans (ORF of C50F2.3, accession number AAB37794; 47.5% identical), and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (ORF of SPBC211.02c, accession number CAB75410; 40.5% identical) (31Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar). The searches also revealed that SYF1 is a most homologous protein inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, although the overall homology is not as high as in the other species (23.8% identical). The alignment of these proteins with XAB2 is shown in Fig. 2. The function of these proteins has not been identified. However, the strong conservation of XAB2 observed between lower and higher eukaryotes suggests the importance of this protein. The SYF1 gene had been identified as a synthetic lethal mutant with the CDC40/PRP17gene, which is involved in S phase progression of the cell cycle and pre-mRNA splicing in S. cerevisiae (47Dix I. Russell C. Yehuda S.B. Kupiec M. Beggs J.D. RNA. 1999; 5: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The homology observed between XAB2 and SYF1 gives rise to a possibility that in addition to NER, XAB2 may be involved in cell cycle control and pre-mRNA splicing (see “Discussion”). The alignment of these proteins also revealed that the carboxyl-terminal portion (29 amino acid residues at positions 825–853) of XAB2 is conserved in theD. melanogaster and C. elegans proteins, but absent in the S. pombe and S. cerevisiae proteins (Fig. 2). This region may have a specific role only in multicellular organisms.Figure 3XAB2 has 15 TPR motifs. A, schematic representation of the XAB2 protein. Open boxes with numbers and hatched boxes indicate TPR motifs and acidic regions, respectively.B, TPR sequence alignment. The 15 repeats in the predicted XAB2 protein were aligned.

Three classes of TPR (classes I–III) are categorized based on the conserved sequences (34Sikorski R.S. Michaud W.A. Wootton J.C. Boguski M.S. Connelly C. Hieter P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1991; 56: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). TPRs are found in proteins of different organisms ranging from bacteria to humans implicated in protein complexes with diverged functions such as cell cycle control, transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, and mitochondrial and peroxisomal protein transport (35Goebl M. Yanagida M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 173-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 36Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Mutational and structural analyses suggest that TPR domains play a role in intra- and intermolecular protein interactions (37Lamb J.R. Michaud W.A. Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4321-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 38Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 39Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed that XAB2 has 15 motifs of the class I TPR covering most of the protein (Figs. 2 and 3), suggesting that XAB2 may function as an important factor for protein-complex formations in NER. Since TPR proteins have been frequently found in complexes with WD-40 repeat-containing polypeptides (40van der Voorn L. Ploegh H.L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 41Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar), we focused on the CSA protein, the known NER factor containing WD-40 repeats (19Henning K.A. Li L. Iyer N. McDaniel L.D.

As shown in Fig.4 A, in vitrotranslated XAB2 was indeed able to bind to GST-CSA fusion protein, and inversely in vitro translated CSA interacted with GST-XAB2 fusion protein. To verify the interaction in vivo, immunoprecipitations were performed using WCE of CS-A cells stably expressing functional HA-tagged CSA (see “Experimental Procedures”). Anti-HA monoclonal antibodies co-immunoprecipitated a small but significant fraction of XAB2 together with HA-tagged CSA (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that at least part of XAB2 is associated with CSA in vivo. The interaction with CSA prompted us to examine whether XAB2 interacts with CSB as well, since both CS proteins are specifically involved in the TCR pathway. Using WCE of CS-B cells stably expressing physiological levels of functional HA-/His6-double-tagged CSB (2tCSB) (see Ref. 21van Gool A.J. Citterio E. Rademakers S. van Os R. Vermeulen W.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5955-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar for documentation of these cells), immunoprecipitations with anti-HA monoclonal antibodies revealed an association of significant quantities of XAB2 with CSB (Fig.5 A, upper part). This immunoprecipitated fraction also contained a significant proportion of RNA polymerase II, as we have previously shown (21van Gool A.J. Citterio E. Rademakers S. van Os R. Vermeulen W"
https://openalex.org/W2072874326,"Insertion of copper into superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) in vivo requires the copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS). CCS encompasses three protein domains: copper binding Domains I and III at the amino and carboxyl termini, and a central Domain II homologous to SOD1. Using a yeast interaction mating system, yeast CCS was seen to physically interact with SOD1, and this interaction required sequences at the predicted dimer interface of CCS Domain II. Interactions with SOD1 also required sequences of Domain III, but not Domain I. Mutations were introduced at the dimer interface of yeast SOD1, and the corresponding mutant failed to interact with CCS. When loaded with copper independent of CCS, this mutant SOD1 exhibited superoxide scavenging activity, but was normally inactive in vivo because CCS failed to recognize the enzyme. Activation of SOD1 by CCS was also examined using an in vivo assay for copper incorporation into SOD1. Yeast CCS was observed to insert copper into a pre-existing pool of apoSOD1 without the need for new SOD1 synthesis or for protein unfolding by the major SSA cytosolic heat shock proteins. Our data are consistent with a model in which prefolded dimers of apoSOD1 serve as substrate for the CCS copper chaperone."

Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 61-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Like other members of the myogenic bHLH family, MyoD is able to induce a muscle phenotype in nonmuscle cells, a phenomenon referred to as myogenic conversion (3Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). MyoD and the other myogenic bHLHs transactivate muscle specific promoters, such as that of the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) gene (4Weintraub H. Dwarki V.J. Verma I. Davis R. Hollenberg S. Snider L. Lassar A. Tapscott S.J. Genet. Dev. 1991; 5: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Myogenic bHLHs are recruited to these promoters through specific sequences referred to as E-boxes, to which they bind as heterodimers with the ubiquitous E12/E47 proteins (5Murre C. McCaw P.S.

MyoD is expressed early in the muscle cell lineage; it is expressed but poorly active in proliferating myoblasts, and its activity is regulated by multiple mechanisms. MyoD is a very unstable molecule that is degraded through ubiquitination (6Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A.

CBP was first characterized as a co-activator for the CREB transcription factor (12Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 265: 855-859Crossref Scopus (1770) Google Scholar), and p300 was characterized as a target for transforming viral proteins such as E1A (11Arany Z. Sellers W.R. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1994; 77: 799-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). CBP and p300 share domains of strong homology, including several domains of interaction with a variety of transcription factors (13Goldman P.S. Tran V.K. Goodman R.H. Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 103-120PubMed Google Scholar), and appear to be functionally equivalent in all systems studied so far, with one exception (14Kawasaki H. Eckner R. Yao T.P. Taira K. Chiu R.

In cells, CBP/p300 are part of large multimolecular complexes, some of which also include general transcription factors (15Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. Parvin J.D.

In addition, CBP/p300 also display an intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (17Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y.

Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). Core histone acetylation appears to be the hallmark of dynamic chromatin and is associated with active transcription, whereas deacetylated histones are most often found in silent, static parts of the genome (20Turner B.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Some histone acetyltransferases are involved in transcription (21Kuo M.H. Allis C.D.

CBP/p300 directly interacts with MyoD, apparently through the MyoD transactivation domain located in the N-terminal moiety of the molecule (32Sartorelli V. Huang J. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Results from transient transfection assays using mutants of these proteins suggested differential roles for CBP/p300 and PCAF. In particular, transactivation of the p21 promoter by MyoD seemed to require PCAF HAT activity but not CBP/p300 HAT activity (10Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. Yang X.J. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V.V. Howard B.H. Kedes L. Wang J.Y. Graessmann A. Nakatani Y. Levrero M. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). HAT targets in the muscle differentiation program have not yet been fully determined. These targets might include both histone and nonhistone proteins. Indeed, Sartorelli et al. (33Sartorelli V.

Cell. 1999; 4: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) have shown that MyoD itself can be acetylated by PCAF in vitro. In their study, MyoD ectopically expressed in muscle cells was found to be acetylated, and the level of MyoD acetylation appeared to increase slightly during terminal differentiation. In vitro, MyoD acetylation by PCAF appeared to increase its affinity for DNA (33Sartorelli V. Puri P.L. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V. Chung G. Nakatani Y. Wang J.Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Analysis of mutants of the protein in which specific lysines were replaced by arginines suggested that acetylation could play a role in MyoD activity. However, the low activity of the point mutants could result from conformational perturbations of the protein rather than lack of acetylation. Here, we show that endogenous MyoD is acetylated. In contrast to ectopically expressed MyoD (33Sartorelli V. Puri P.L. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V. Chung G. Nakatani Y. Wang J.Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), the level of acetylation of the endogenous protein did not seem to vary during terminal differentiation. In vitro, MyoD could be acetylated by CBP/p300 as well as by PCAF. The sites of acetylation were determined by mass spectrometry and confirmed using point mutants of the protein. These experiments indicated that two lysines located at the boundary of the DNA binding/dimerization domain (the bHLH domain), lysine 99 and 102, are specifically acetylated. We have used microinjection experiments in which acetylated and nonacetylated MyoD were directly compared to assess the functional effect of acetylation. MyoD was injected into individual cells together with an MCK GFP reporter vector. Acetylation by CBP or p300, as well as acetylation by PCAF, increased the transactivating capability of MyoD. Functional acetylation required the integrity of lysines that are acetylatedin vitro. Taken together, these results demonstrate that MyoD acetylation increases its activity, and that acetylation by CBP/p300 is as efficient as acetylation by PCAF for activating the protein. Myoblastic C2C12 and embryonic C3H 10T1/2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (Dominique Dutscher) and 10% fetal calf serum, respectively. To induce terminal differentiation, C2C12 were placed in differentiation medium (Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, 1% fetal calf serum). Phenotypic differentiation was maximal after 72 h. The bacterial expression vectors containing wild type MyoD cDNA and all mutated species of MyoD were kind gifts of Dr. K. Breitschopf, A. Ciechanover, and S.

Acetylation of recombinant MyoD was carried out in vitro by incubating 2–4 μg of protein with 0.1–2 μg of recombinant HATs for 1 h at 30 °C, in a buffer containing 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, inhibitors of proteases (Complete; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and deacetylases (1 m sodium butyrate; Sigma), and 0.2 μCi of [14C]acetyl coenzyme A (ICN) per reaction. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed, Coomassie-stained, dried, and exposed to either x-ray film or imaging screens for PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Synthetic peptides were acetylated as described previously (35Ait-Si-Ali S. Ramirez S. Robin P. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3869-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), using about 100 pmol of HAT proteins and [14C]acetyl-CoA. Peptides corresponded to amino acids 1–25 of histone H3, amino acids 1–23 of histone H4, and amino acids 96–107, 109–127, and 130–149 of MyoD, with the following sequences: H3, ARTKQTARSKSTGGKAPRKQLATKA-GSGSGK-biocytin-G; H4, SGRGKGGKGLGKGGAKRHRKVLR-GSGSGK-biocytin-G; MyoD-(96–107), WACKACKRKTTN-GSGSGK-biocytin-G; MyoD-(109–127), DRRKAATMRERRRLSKVNE-GSGSGK-BIO-G; MyoD-(130–149), ETLKRCTSSNPNQRLPKVEI-GSGSGK- BIO-G. After acetylation, samples were incubated with streptavidin-coated beads, and beads were washed and counted on a β-counter. The acetylated MyoD peptide described above and fragments thereof obtained by proteolytic cleavage using ArgC protease (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; protease/substrate ratio 1:30, 2 h at 37 °C) were analyzed by mass spectrometry and chemical sequencing. The peptide mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker Reflex spectrometer (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization), using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. Mass spectrometry sequencing was performed by analysis of fragment ions generated by postsource decay (37Chaurand P. Luetzenkirchen F. Spengler B. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 10: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), using the FAST method from Bruker-Daltonic (Bremen, Germany). Chemical microsequencing was performed using protein sequencer 473A (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). C3H 10T/2 cells were grown on coverslips. All proteins and plasmids were microinjected in a buffer containing 10 mmTris, pH 7.5, and 100 mm KCl (final volume, 10 μl). Cells received a mixture of dextran/rhodamine (M r40,000 and 10,000 fixable; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) at 1% final concentration, together with 2 mg/ml MCK-GFP/NLS reporter vector (expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to a nuclear localization signal; a kind gift of Dr. S. A. Leibovitch) and 1 μg of MyoD (incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with 100 ng of baculovirus-produced PCAF or p300, with or without acetyl-CoA (1 mm final concentration)). After 24 h of culture, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Coverslips were then mounted on slides with VectaShield (Biovalley) and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed using standard procedures. Immunoprecipitated proteins were collected on Protein G-agarose (Sigma). Beads were washed three times with PBS. The samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% dry milk, incubated with antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma), and developed using the Roche Molecular Biochemicals LumiLight kit as recommended by the manufacturer. Acetylation of MyoD in live cells was assessed by immunoprecipitation of total cell extracts of proliferating or differentiating C2C12 myoblasts with anti-acetyllysine antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) followed by Western blotting analysis with anti-MyoD antibodies (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Alternatively, extracts were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-MyoD antibodies (5.8A; Novocastra), followed by Western blotting with the anti-acetyllysine antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) and the anti-MyoD antibodies (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). A synthetic oligonucleotide containing an E box derived from a muscle creatine kinase gene enhancer (5′-CTAGACCCCAACACCTGCTGCCTT-3′) was32P-end-labeled using the T4 polynucleotide kinase end-labeling kit (New England Biolabs). Recombinant MyoD (wild type or mutants; 0.5 μg) was incubated with 2 ng of probe in a reaction mixture containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 mKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 300 ng of poly(dI-dC) for 30 min at room temperature. The binding reactions were loaded onto nondenaturing acrylamide gels run in 0.25× TBE at 50 V for 1 h at room temperature. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. Recombinant MyoD (untagged; see “Experimental Procedures”) was incubated with recombinant HATs (p300 or PCAF were produced in baculovirus-driven overexpression systems) together with 14C-labeled acetyl-CoA. Both enzymes were able to promote the incorporation of14C into MyoD and not into glutathioneS-transferase, used as an irrelevant control protein (Fig.1). Incorporation was estimated at roughly one molecule of acetyl incorporated per three molecules of MyoD. This result indicates that, at least in vitro, MyoD can be acetylated by CBP/p300 and by PCAF and that CBP/p300 is as efficient as PCAF or more efficient than PCAF in acetylating MyoD. In order to assess the physiological relevance of MyoD acetylation, the acetylation of the endogenous MyoD protein was estimated using an antibody directed against acetylated lysines. Extracts from growing or terminally differentiating myoblasts (C2C12), or else from nonmuscle cells (C3H 10T1/2) used as a negative control, were immunoprecipitated using this antibody and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-MyoD antibodies. MyoD could be detected in the immunoprecipitates of C2C12 cells obtained with the anti-acetyllysine antibody (Fig.2 A). MyoD could not be detected in non-muscle cell extracts immunoprecipitated with the same antibody, and an irrelevant antibody did not pull down MyoD in muscle cell extracts. This result strongly suggests that endogenous MyoD is acetylated. In addition, the levels of MyoD acetylation in growing myoblasts appeared to be equivalent to those in differentiated cells (Fig. 2 A, compare C2 growth and C2 differentiation). This result was confirmed by reciprocal experiments, in which extracts were immunoprecipitated using the anti-MyoD antibody and analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-acetyllysine antibody (Fig. 2 B). Comparison of proliferating and terminally differentiating myoblasts again did not show any increase in the level of MyoD acetylation upon differentiation (Fig. 2 B, compare C2 growth and C2 differentiation). The specificity of the anti-acetyllysine antibody was verified using in vitro acetylated MyoD, which demonstrated that the antibody recognized only the acetylated species (Fig.2 C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that acetylated MyoD is detectable in C2C12 muscle cells and suggest that the level of MyoD acetylation is not modulated during terminal differentiation.Figure 1MyoD is acetylated by CBP/p300 or PCAFin vitro. Recombinant, untagged MyoD (M) and glutathione S-transferase (GST, G) as a negative control were incubated with recombinant p300 or PCAF produced in a baculovirus-driven expression system, together with [14C[acetyl-CoA. Enzymatic activities were standardized as in Ref. 35Ait-Si-Ali S. Ramirez S. Robin P. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3869-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, using a peptide corresponding to the N-terminal of histone H3 (see Fig. 3 C).

A and B, protein extracts were prepared from growing or differentiating myoblast C2C12 cells (C2) or else nonmuscle embryonic C3H 10T1/2 cells as a negative control (C3). Extracts were immunoprecipitated (ip) using an anti-acetyllysine antibody or an anti-MyoD antibody (as indicated). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting (wb), using an anti-MyoD antibody or an anti-acetyllysine antibody as indicated. The band corresponding to MyoD is indicated by an arrow, as well as the band corresponding to the immunoglobulins (IGs) used for immunoprecipitation (A).

All of these experiments have been reproduced twice with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Point mutants in which lysines are progressively replaced by arginines, starting at the N terminus (Fig. 3 A), were used in in vitro experiments to locate the acetylated lysines. The replacement of three lysines located at the boundary of the bHLH domain, lysines 99, 102, and 104 (Fig. 3 B), strongly decreased acetylation by CBP/p300, suggesting that these lysines were acetylated. No further decrease was observed when, in addition, downstream lysines were mutated. This result suggests that CBP/p300 acetylates the same lysines as those acetylated by PCAF (33Sartorelli V. Puri P.L. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V. Chung G. Nakatani Y. Wang J.Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). This result was confirmed using synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid sequences of MyoD that include lysines (Fig. 3 C). Peptides corresponding to amino acids 109–127 or 130–149 were not acetylated in this assay, whereas the peptide corresponding to amino acids 96–107 of MyoD was acetylated, confirming the results obtained with MyoD mutants (Fig. 3 B). Peptide 96–107 was acetylated to similar levels by the two enzymes, as was a peptide corresponding to the histone H3 N-terminal 24 amino acids used as an internal standard. In contrast, only CBP/p300 was able to acetylate a peptide corresponding to H4 N-terminal sequence; no acetylation was observed with this peptide using PCAF, as expected from previously published data concerning PCAF substrate preference (29Schiltz R.L. Mizzen C.A. Vassilev A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Nakatani Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1189-1192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In order to determine the site of acetylation, the MyoD 96–107 synthetic peptide modified by CBP, p300, or PCAF was analyzed by mass spectrometry and chemical sequencing (Fig.4 A and data not shown). Cleavage of the peptide at arginine sites using ArgC protease invariably yielded an unmodified form of the C-terminal peptide (positions 9–18; M + H = 1219.6) (Fig. 4 A). The modification was always restricted to the N-terminal portion (positions 1–8), and thus lysine residue 9 (MyoD Lys104) can be excluded as a site of modification. Likewise, the N-terminal α-amino group was not modified, since in all cases, the mass peaks corresponding to the nonacetylated tryptophan immonium ion (m/z = 159.1) and the unmodified b2 ion (Trp-Ala; m/z = 258.1) were detectable in fragment spectra, whereas the peaks for their acetylated counterparts were missing (not shown). In the monoacetylated peptide (M + H = 1007.5) the main site of acetylation appears to be Lys7 (MyoD Lys102). This is mainly concluded from the fact that, after mass spectrometry fragmentation (data not shown), we detected the mass signal (m/z = 345.2) for the acetylated y2 ion (Ac-Lys-Arg) and the following y ion series, but the signal for the nonacetylated ion was either absent or extremely weak. Lys4(MyoD Lys99) is also acetylated, albeit to a lesser extent, as can be deduced from the presence of the acetylated b4 and b5 ions (531.2 and 602.3) besides their nonmodified counterparts (489.2 and 560.3). These findings were confirmed by Edman sequencing of the monoacetylated peptide. No differences could be found when we compared the peptides modified by CBP, p300, and PCAF. To summarize, in all cases the preferential site of acetylation in the in vitroassay corresponds to MyoD Lys102, and Lys99 is also modified by the enzymes. This results was confirmed by the analysis of mutants of MyoD in which lysines 99 and 102 or 104 were mutated. Whereas replacement of lysine 99 and 102 by arginines decreased MyoD acetylation to background levels, replacement of lysine 104 did not have any effect (Fig.4 B). Identical results were obtained with PCAF as the acetylating enzyme (data not shown). X-ray analysis of a MyoD-DNA complex had previously demonstrated that lysines 99 and 102 are not involved in DNA binding (38Ma P.C.M. Rould M.A. Weintraub H. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1994; 77: 451-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Indeed, their mutation did not have any effect on MyoD binding to DNA in EMSA experiments, and mutants 2–5 displayed a wild type affinity for DNA (Fig. 4 C). As expected from x-ray data (38Ma P.C.M. Rould M.A. Weintraub H. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1994; 77: 451-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), the mutation of lysine 146, in contrast, destroyed the interaction between MyoD and its target sequence (Fig. 4 C, mutants 6and 7). Taken together, these results indicate that both p300 and PCAF are able to specifically acetylate MyoD in vitro, most likely on lysines 99 and 102. Mutation of lysines 99, 102, and 104 has been previously shown to decrease MyoD activity either on muscle-specific promoters in transient transfections or in myogenic conversion assays (33Sartorelli V. Puri P.L. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V. Chung G. Nakatani Y. Wang J.Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Co-transfection assays suggested that PCAF could be involved in MyoD activation but did not rule out a possible involvement of CBP/p300 in this process and did not demonstrate a direct effect of PCAF on MyoD. In order to determine whether modification by CBP/p300 as well as by PCAF had functional effects on MyoD, we have used a microinjection assay. Recombinant MyoD at limiting concentrations was acetylatedin vitro by p300 or PCAF (negative controls were incubated with the HAT enzymes without the addition of acetyl-CoA) and microinjected into nonmuscle cells, together with a GFP reporter construct under the control of the MCK promoter. Cells also received rhodamine-labeled dextran as an injection control. GFP-positive cells were scored 24 h later. In this experimental setting, GFP expression was dependent on MyoD, and transactivation by MyoD was specific, since MyoD had no effect on an irrelevant promoter (data not shown). Results (Fig. 5) show that MyoD acetylation increased its ability to transactivate the MCK promoter, as assessed first by the increased number of GFP-positive microinjected cells and second by the fact that GFP-positive cells that received acetylated MyoD displayed a brighter fluorescence than those that received nonacetylated MyoD (Fig. 5 A). Injected doses of acetylated or nonacetylated MyoD seemed to be equivalent, as assessed by immunofluorescence on injected cells using an anti-MyoD antibody (data not shown). Acetylation of MyoD resulted in a 3–4-fold increase in its activity. Similar results were obtained with PCAF and with p300, indicating that both enzymes are able to functionally activate MyoD by acetylation. The functional activation was related to acetylation of lysines 99, 102, and/or 104, since triple point mutants of these lysines were not activated by acetylation by p300 (mut2 and mut5, Fig. 5, B andD) nor by PCAF (mut2 and mut5, Fig. 5,C and D). Taken together, these results indicate that acetylation of MyoD by CBP/p300 or PCAF on lysines 99 and 102 positively affects its activity. MyoD, a key regulator of muscle cell differentiation, is expressed but inactive in proliferating myoblasts and is activated on terminal differentiation. It is regulated by a number of mechanisms, including ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and inhibitors, such as Id. In addition, Sartorelli et al. (33Sartorelli V. Puri P.L. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V. Chung G. Nakatani Y. Wang J.Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) have recently shown that MyoD can also be acetylated by a nuclear HAT, PCAF, at least when ectopically expressed in muscle cells. We here show that endogenous MyoD can be detected in an acetylated form (Fig. 2), since it is specifically recognized by anti-acetyllysine antibodies. Interestingly, MyoD appears as a single band when detected using this antibody, whereas it is a doublet of bands when detected using an anti-MyoD antibody. These two bands have previously been shown to correspond to post-translational modifications of the protein by phosphorylation (7Kitzmann M. Vandromme M. Schaeffer V. Carnac G. Labbe J.C. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3167-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this regard, it will be interesting to investigate the relationship between acetylation and other post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. Our results suggest that the acetylation level of endogenous MyoD did not vary in a significant manner during terminal differentiation, in contrast to what was described by Sartorelli et al.(33Sartorelli V. Puri P.L. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V. Chung G. Nakatani Y. Wang J.Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) for ectopically expressed MyoD. Endogenous MyoD is thus acetylated in proliferating myoblasts, in which it is inactive; hence, acetylation is not sufficient for MyoD activation when terminal differentiation is triggered. Other mechanisms, such as dissociation from the inhibitor Id, are likely to be involved in this activation.In vitro, MyoD can be acetylated by CBP/p300 as well as by PCAF. Mass spectrometry analysis of synthetic peptides suggested that both enzymes specifically acetylate two lysines, lysine 99 and 102, with the same preference for lysine 102. Analysis of mutants of these lysines supported this conclusion (Figs. 3 and 4). This stands in contrast to what has been previously published concerning PCAF (33Sartorelli V. Puri P.L. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V. Chung G. Nakatani Y. Wang J.Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), where three lysines were found to be acetylated in the same region (99, 102, and 104) in experiments using synthetic peptides and mutants of these lysines. The determination of the lysines acetylated in live cells is the important issue and is currently under investigation. The acetylated lysines are located at the boundary of MyoD's DNA binding and heterodimerization domain, the bHLH. CBP/p300 and PCAF seem to acetylate the same lysine residues on MyoD, in contrast to what has been observed for other substrates; e.g. CBP/p300 acetylates several lysines on histone H4 as well as on histone H3, whereas PCAF shows a strong preference for lysine 14 of histone H3 (Ref. 29Schiltz R.L. Mizzen C.A. Vassilev A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Nakatani Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1189-1192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 3 C). We have used a microinjection assay to demonstrate that acetylation of MyoD by both CBP/p300 and PCAF increases its transactivating capability by 3–4-fold. We believe that this represents a highly significant increase, given the fact that, from our estimation, only 13 of the MyoD molecules are actually acetylated in the samples. This activation corroborates previous results obtained in transient transfection experiments (33Sartorelli V. Puri P.L. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V. Chung G. Nakatani Y. Wang J.Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The interpretation of these transfection experiments was based on the comparison between wild type MyoD and point mutants in which specific lysines have been replaced by arginines, which cannot be acetylated. However, the effect of these mutations could be the result of a conformational change of the protein, rather than of the lack of acetylation. Our approach using microinjection is more direct. In addition, our approach allowed to directly demonstrate that, like PCAF, CBP/p300 is also able to activate MyoD through acetylation. Although the CBP/p300 HAT domain is dispensable for activation of the p21 promoter by MyoD (10Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. Yang X.J. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V.V. Howard B.H. Kedes L. Wang J.Y. Graessmann A. Nakatani Y. Levrero M. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), there are arguments supporting an important role of CBP/p300 HAT in muscle cell differentiation. For example, a mutant of CBP with impaired HAT activity acts as a negative transdominant for terminal differentiation in stable transfectants in which it is inducible. 2A. Polesskaya and A. Harel-Bellan, unpublished observations. Results described in this paper suggest that the CBP/p300 HAT domain might indeed participate in the process of terminal differentiation through acetylation of MyoD. The mechanism through which MyoD acetylation increases its activity in our microinjection assay is a matter of conjecture. Experiments in which microinjected MyoD was detected using immunocytofluorescence indicated that the doses of injected protein was similar in the two cases (data not shown) and, thus, that the effect was not due to an artifactual increase of the protein concentration due to the process of acetylation, such as, for example, increased solubility of the acetylated samples. Taken together, our results directly demonstrate that MyoD acetylation by CBP/p300, as well as by PCAF, increases its transactivating capability. Hence both CBP/p300 and PCAF are good candidates for MyoD-acetylating enzymes in vivo. We thank Z. Mishal for help with the analysis of microinjected cells; L.

Although it has been assumed that phosphorylation of regulatory light chain of myosin (RLC) controls motility of mammalian non-muscle cells, the functional significance of RLC phosphorylation remains uninvestigated. To address this problem, we have produced unphosphorylatable RLC (T18A/S19A RLC) and overexpressed it in COS-7 cells and normal rat kidney cells. Overexpression of T18A/S19A RLC but not wild type RLC almost completely abolished concanavalin A-induced receptor cap formation. The results indicate that myosin phosphorylation is critical for concanavalin A-induced gathering of surface receptors. T18A/S19A RLC overexpression resulted in the production of multinucleated cells, suggesting the failure of proper cell division in these cells. Video microscopic observation revealed that cells expressing T18A/S19A RLC showed abnormalities during mitosis in two respects. One is that the cells produced abnormal cleavage furrows, resulting in incomplete cytokinesis, which suggests that myosin phosphorylation is important for the normal recruitment of myosin molecules into the contractile ring structure. The other is that separation of chromosomes from the metaphase plate is disrupted in T18A/S19A RLC expressing cells, thus preventing proper transition from metaphase to anaphase.

It is known that actin and myosin undergo reorganizations in cultured mammalian cells in response to cellular signals in various cellular motile processes such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, capping of surface receptors, and cytokinesis (1–16). For example, actin and myosin form stress fibers in interphase cells, but this structure disappears at the onset of mitosis. During cytokinesis, actomyosin is redistributed into the equatorial region to produce the cleavage furrow (see Refs. 17Mabuchi I. Int. Rev.

On the other hand, a signal initiated by the binding of a lectin to its receptor triggers reorganization of actomyosin thus gathering the lectin receptors to produce a “cap” structure (5Schreiner G.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 20Trybus K.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 18: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Tan J.L. Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 721-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Myosin regulatory light chain (RLC)1 is phosphorylated at various sites. Serine 19 and threonine 18 are the sites responsible for activation of myosin motor activity, and the former site is thought to be physiologically more important (see Refs.22Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1987: 423-482Google Scholar, 23Sellers J.R. Adelstein R.S. The Enzymes. 18.

The protein kinase responsible for phosphorylation at these sites is Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), and in smooth muscle cells, this kinase primarily dictates the level of myosin phosphorylation (see Refs. 22Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1987: 423-482Google Scholar and 24Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar for reviews). In non-muscle cells, although MLCK is thought to be important for myosin phosphorylation, other protein kinases also play a role in regulating the phosphorylation of myosin (25Edelman A.M. Lin W.H.

On the other hand, phosphorylation at serine 1/serine 2 and threonine 9 of the regulatory light chain, which is catalyzed by protein kinase C and Cdc2 kinase, is inhibitory, and phosphorylation at these sites decreases the affinity for actin (28Nishikawa M.

Immunocytochemistry has revealed that myosin is present at the equatorial region during cell division (12Fujiwara K. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 848-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar,13Aubin J.E.K. Weber Osborn M. Exp. Cell Res. 1979; 124: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16Matsumura F.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cytokinesis by microinjection of anti-myosin antibodies further suggests the importance of myosin function in cell division (32Mabuchi I. Okuno M. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Conclusive evidence was obtained by genetic manipulation, and it was found that the deletion of the gene for myosin II in Dictyostelium cells abolishes cytokinesis (33De Lozanne A. Spudich J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar).A remaining question is whether or not phosphorylation of myosin is required for cytokinesis. Fishkind et al. (34Fishkind D.J. Cao L.G. Wang Y.L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) reported that microinjection of constitutively active MLCK into mitotic cells did not affect the formation of cleavage furrows and cytokinesis, although the transit time from nuclear envelope breakdown to anaphase onset was delayed. However, myosin in mitotic cells is phosphorylated (at least to a certain extent), and injection of active MLCK may not significantly change the phosphorylation level of myosin at the cleavage furrow, as the myosin phosphorylation level increases in non-injected cells at the onset of telophase. Whereas the bulk of evidence supports the idea that myosin II function is critical for cell division, the role of serine 19 phosphorylation during cell division in mammalian cells remains obscure. In the present study, we overexpressed a myosin regulatory light chain mutant, T18A/S19A RLC, which eliminated the phosphorylation sites in order to hamper myosin phosphorylation. The regulatory light chain was tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) to identify the cells transfected with the RLC-GFP construct. Overexpression of unphosphorylatable RLC in mammalian cells abolished surface receptor cap formation. Furthermore, normal cytokinesis was significantly disrupted by the overexpression of unphosphorylatable RLC in mammalian cells. These results indicate that the phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain is critical for cell division of mammalian non-muscle cells.DISCUSSIONActomyosin motor activity is thought to play a critical role in various aspects of cell motility such as cell locomotion, receptor capping, and cell division. In vertebrate and non-muscle cells, myosin motor activity in vitro is regulated by phosphorylation of RLC at Ser-19 and Thr-18, especially at the former site. Therefore, the cell motile processes that are governed by actomyosin contractile activity are assumed to be controlled by a dynamic change in RLC phosphorylation during these processes. Yet the relationship between myosin phosphorylation and these cell movements is not well understood. In the present study, we have approached this question by overexpressing unphosphorylatable RLC in mammalian somatic cells. It is known that phosphorylation at Ser-19 and Thr-18 of RLC is mandatory for the motor activity of vertebrate non-muscle and smooth muscle myosins (see Refs. 22Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1987: 423-482Google Scholar, 23Sellers J.R. Adelstein R.S. The Enzymes. 18. Academic Press, New York1987: 381-418Google Scholar, 24Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar for reviews). Previously, it was shown that substitution of these residues by Ala abolishes myosin motor activity (41Kamisoyama H. Araki Y. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 840-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that this substitution also hampers the thick filament formation of myosin in vitro (41Kamisoyama H. Araki Y. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 840-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of overexpression of T18A/S19A RLC in cell motile activity may be due to either diminished actomyosin contractile activity or diminished recruitment of myosin into filamentous structures. One way to obtain RLC overexpressing cells is to produce RLC overexpressing cell lines, but we avoided this approach in this study because of the following. 1) The cell phenotype may change during the establishment of a cell line due to secondary effects of overexpression. 2) The overexpression of unphosphorylatable RLC may cause the cell not to proliferate properly because of the disruption of mitosis. In order to identify transiently transfected cells, GFP fluorescence was utilized in the present study. Two approaches were taken. First, RLC was tagged with GFP. The advantage of this approach is that the localization of myosin during cell motility can be directly monitored. Therefore, we employed this approach in most of the experiments in this study. The GFP-tagged RLC showed normal myosin heavy chain binding activityin vitro. Furthermore, RLC-GFP showed stress fiber localization in interphase cells and a localization at the cleavage furrow in mitotic cells. Therefore, we concluded that myosin containing RLC-GFP retains the authentic properties of myosin. Nevertheless, to ensure our findings further, RLC cDNA was cloned into a pTracer vector containing a separate GFP expression cassette. The cells transfected with this vector express RLC and GFP independently so that non-tagged RLC associates with myosin, but the transfected cells can still be identified by the GFP signal. Practically identical results were obtained using both approaches in both cell types for the motile events examined in this study, i.e. surface capping and cell division.We first demonstrate that deletion of RLC phosphorylation sites by substitution of Ser-19/Thr-18 by Ala inhibits the induction of the receptor cap structure. The antibody that recognizes Ser-19 phosphorylation of RLC was detected under the ConA cap in both non-transfected and wild type RLC-GFP transfected cells but not T18A/S19A RLC-GFP-transfected cells. These results clearly indicate that the myosin RLC phosphorylation at Ser-19 is critical for receptor capping. Previously, it was reported that overall RLC phosphorylation in whole cell extracts increases during the capping event (9Bourguignon L.Y. Nagpal M.L. Hsing Y.C. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 889-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and that actomyosin-containing structures are associated with cap formation (5Schreiner G. Fujiwara K. Pollard T.D. Unanue E. J. Exp. Med. 1977; 145: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 6Bourguignon L.Y.W. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The present results are consistent with these earlier findings and provide direct evidence that myosin phosphorylation is required for receptor capping in mammalian cells. It was reported previously that, in Dictyostelium, ConA-induced capping was unaffected by disruption of a calmodulin-independent MLCK (mlck-A) gene (47Smith J.L. Silveira L.A. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12321-12326Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), even though mlck-A increases RLC phosphorylation of Dictyostelium myosin by treatment with ConA. The discrepancy from the present results is likely to be due to a difference in the regulation between the two myosins. Whereas RLC phosphorylation is required for myosin motor activity in vertebrate smooth muscle and non-muscle myosin, RLC phosphorylation does not significantly augment the actin translocating activity ofDictyostelium myosin (48Ostrow B.D. Chen P. Chisholm R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1945-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).It has been assumed that the activation of myosin contractile activity is important for mitosis, especially during cytokinesis, since actomyosin is enriched at the cleavage furrow and forms the contractile ring that narrows during cell division (12Fujiwara K. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 848-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 13Aubin J.E.K. Weber Osborn M. Exp. Cell Res. 1979; 124: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Maupin P. Pollard T.D. J. Ultrastruct. Mol. Struct. Res. 1986; 94: 92-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 15Sanger J.M. Mittal B. Dome J.S. Sanger J.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 14: 201-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although it is accepted that actomyosin function is crucial for cell division, it is unclear how actomyosin contractile activity is regulated during mitosis in vertebrate cells. As vertebrate myosin motor activity is regulated by RLC phosphorylation, it is reasonable to assume that actomyosin function and thus myosin phosphorylation is temporally and spatially regulated during mitosis, but the functional significance of serine 19 phosphorylation of myosin II RLC during cell division in mammalian cells is not understood. It has been proposed that phosphorylation of myosin at Ser-19 of RLC takes place in the equatorial contractile ring and activates contraction of the cleavage furrow after the dephosphorylation of RLC at the Cdc2 kinase sites (49Pollard T.D. Satterwhite L. Cisek L. Corden J. Sato M. Maupin P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 582: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but the significance of the phosphorylation at the Cdc2 kinase sites during cell division is questioned (50Shuster C.B. Burgess D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 981-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The present results show that the cells expressing the unphosphorylatable form of RLC become multinuclear, suggesting an abnormal cell dividing process, which is consistent with this model. Microscopic observation of mitotic cells revealed that there are two types of defects in the cells expressing unphosphorylatable RLC. One is the formation of an abnormal cleavage furrow followed by the failure to complete proper cytokinesis. The other is the inhibition of transition from metaphase to anaphase. As shown in Fig. 9, T18A/S19A RLC expressing cells showed a distorted cleavage furrow. This result suggests that the contractile ring is not properly arranged at the equator of the cells. Previously, Wang and co-workers (34Fishkind D.J. Cao L.G. Wang Y.L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) observed that NRK cells microinjected with constitutively active MLCK had a delayed onset of anaphase, but the treatment did not alter the rate of progression of cytokinesis. It has also been demonstrated (51Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) that the level of RLC phosphorylation at Ser-19/Thr-18 increases at the cell stage just prior to entering cytokinesis, and the phosphorylation level is maintained during cell division. Therefore, it would be plausible that myosin II phosphorylation is elevated before myosin is recruited into the contractile ring, and the disruption of myosin phosphorylation may alter the formation of a normal contractile ring.An interesting finding is that the overexpression of unphosphorylatable RLC disrupted the movement of chromosomes from the metaphase plate, suggesting that myosin plays an important role in the progression from metaphase to anaphase and that myosin phosphorylation is involved in properly performed karyokinesis. This view is supported by the previous finding that microinjection of constitutively active MLCK delayed the onset of anaphase (34Fishkind D.J. Cao L.G. Wang Y.L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These results suggest that proper myosin phosphorylation during mitosis is critical for normal transition from metaphase to anaphase. Although the mechanism by which activation of myosin function influences chromosome separation is unclear, it was reported that anti-myosin IIA antibody stains the spindle poles between prophase and metaphase (31Kelley C.A. Sellers J.R. Gard D.L. Bui D. Adelstein R.S. Baines I.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported (16Matsumura F. Ono S. Yamakita Y. Totsukawa G. Yamashiro S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) that anti-phospho-RLC polyclonal antibody stained the spindle poles, although since this antibody also recognized other proteins it remained uncertain whether or not phospho-RLC was present there. However, our monoclonal anti-phospho-RLC antibody also recognized the spindle poles during transition from prophase to metaphase, supporting the presence of phosphorylated myosin. 2S. Komatsu and M. Ikebe, unpublished observations.The present findings, together with these observations, suggest that myosin phosphorylation is involved not only in cytokinesis but also in the separation of sister chromatids. It was previously found that microinjection of anti-myosin II antibodies into starfish eggs inhibited cytokinesis (32Mabuchi I. Okuno M. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), but this also produced an abnormal mitotic apparatus. These results suggest that anti-myosin II antibodies might influence the mitotic apparatus. The expression of T20A/S21A RLC inDrosophila RLC null germ line cells showed an increase in multinuclear cells (52Jordan P. Karess R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1805-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), resembling the results of the present study. The Drosophila experiment detected abnormal cytokinesis, but an abnormality of karyokinesis was not reported. The difference from the present study could be due to the following: 1) a difference between mitosis during oogenesis and during the somatic cell cycle (present study); 2) a difference in the regulation of mitosis betweenDrosophila and mammalian cells; and 3) a difference between the regulation of myosin II in mammalian cells and inDrosophila (which is not well understood at a molecular level). The myosin RLC null mutant of Dictyostelium showed a deficiency in cytokinesis and produced multinuclear cells (48Ostrow B.D. Chen P. Chisholm R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1945-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 53Chen P. Ostrow B.D. Tafuri S.R. Chisholm R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1933-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, the effect on karyokinesis is not well studied. It should be noted that RLC null cells retain myosin ATPase activity (1/3 of the wild type) and that RLC domain-deficient myosin ofDictyostelium showed more than 50% of the motility activity of the wild type myosin. These results suggest thatDictyostelium RLC null myosin retains some motor activity. Therefore, it is plausible that the inhibition of each biological process related to myosin II activity depends on the extent of the inhibition of myosin II function. Alternatively, the involvement of myosin II in karyokinesis might be developed in mammalian cells but not in lower eukaryotes. Recently, Simerly et al. (54Simerly C. Nowak G. de Lanerolle P. Schatten G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2509-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) reported that the injection of myosin IIA antibody disrupts the eccentric positioning of the metaphase spindle during meiotic maturation, probably through depletion of spindle-associated myosin IIA. The present result together with earlier results suggest the involvement of myosin II function in proper chromosomal segregation during mitosis. Myosin is a motor protein that binds actin filaments and produces force using the chemical energy of ATP. It is known that actin and myosin undergo reorganizations in cultured mammalian cells in response to cellular signals in various cellular motile processes such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, capping of surface receptors, and cytokinesis (1–16). For example, actin and myosin form stress fibers in interphase cells, but this structure disappears at the onset of mitosis. During cytokinesis, actomyosin is redistributed into the equatorial region to produce the cleavage furrow (see Refs. 17Mabuchi I. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1986; 101: 175-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar and 18Salmon E.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar for reviews). On the other hand, a signal initiated by the binding of a lectin to its receptor triggers reorganization of actomyosin thus gathering the lectin receptors to produce a “cap” structure (5Schreiner G. Fujiwara K. Pollard T.D. Unanue E. J. Exp. Med. 1977; 145: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 6Bourguignon L.Y.W. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For both smooth muscle and non-muscle cells (in contrast to highly differentiated striated muscle cells), actomyosin motor activity is primarily regulated by phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain of myosin (19Sellers J.R.

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid with growth-regulating properties, either via Edg receptors or through intracellular actions. In this study, we examined the effects of S1P on the proliferation of human hMF. Human hMF expressed mRNAs for the S1P receptors Edg1, Edg3, and Edg5. These receptors were functional at nanomolar concentrations and coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive and -insensitive G proteins, as demonstrated in guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding assays. S1P potently inhibited hMF growth (IC50 = 1 μm), in a pertussis toxin-insensitive manner. Analysis of the mechanisms involved in growth inhibition revealed that S1P rapidly increased prostaglandin E2 production and in turn cAMP, two growth inhibitory messengers for hMF; C2-ceramide and sphingosine, which inhibited hMF proliferation, did not affect cAMP levels. Production of cAMP by S1P was abolished by NS-398, a selective inhibitor of COX-2. Also, S1P potently induced COX-2 protein expression. Blocking COX-2 by NS-398 blunted the antiproliferative effect of S1P. We conclude that S1P inhibits proliferation of hMF, probably via an intracellular mechanism, through early COX-2-dependent release of prostaglandin E2 and cAMP, and delayed COX-2 induction. Our results shed light on a novel role for S1P as a growth inhibitory mediator and point out its potential involvement in the negative regulation of liver fibrogenesis.

We conclude that S1P inhibits proliferation of hMF, probably via an intracellular mechanism, through early COX-2-dependent release of prostaglandin E2 and cAMP, and delayed COX-2 induction. Our results shed light on a novel role for S1P as a growth inhibitory mediator and point out its potential involvement in the negative regulation of liver fibrogenesis. tumor necrosis factor reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction phosphate-buffered saline prostaglandin E2 cyclooxygenase pertussis toxin guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate sphingosine 1-phosphate hepatic myofibroblasts base pairs Liver fibrosis is characterized by increased deposition and altered composition of extracellular matrix during chronic injury. This fibrogenic response is characterized by intense proliferation and accumulation of myofibroblasts that actively synthesize extracellular matrix and proinflammatory cytokines, as demonstrated in experimental models and culture studies (1Olaso E. Friedman S.L. J. Hepatol. 1998; 29: 836-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Evidence for heterogeneity in the liver myofibroblast population has been provided recently, and it has been described in rat that two populations of myofibroblasts with fibrogenic potential, hepatic stellate cells and hepatic myofibroblasts, accumulate during chronic liver injury (2Knittel T.

Recent lines of evidence suggest that sphingolipids, in addition to being structural constituents of cell membranes, play a key role as signaling molecules. In particular, metabolites of sphingolipids, including ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), have recently emerged as a new class of lipid messengers that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (8Hannun Y.A.

Ceramide can be generated following receptor-coupled activation of sphingomyelinase and has been linked to cell growth arrest and apoptosis (8Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). In contrast, S1P, a downstream metabolite of ceramide, produced by phosphorylation of sphingosine following activation of sphingosine kinase, is mitogenic and regulates apoptosis in diverse cell types (12Spiegel S.

S1P modulates cell function by two distinct mechanisms, either as an intracellular second messenger or by activating the Edg (endothelial differentiation gene) receptors, a newly identified family of G protein-coupled receptors, (9Hla T.

The S1P second messenger action has been suggested by the observations that sphingosine kinase activity is increased in response to various stimuli, such as oxidized low density lipoproteins (13Auge N.

On the other hand, extracellular actions of S1P are mediated by Edg receptors, which form a large family of at least eight members, five of them being high affinity receptors for S1P (Edg1, Edg3, Edg5, Edg6, and Edg8), and the others which are selective for lysophosphatidic acid (17Lynch K.R.

In this study, we report that human hMF express functional S1P receptors. S1P inhibits proliferation of hMF, probably via an intracellular mechanism involving early COX-2-dependent release of PGE2 and cAMP and delayed COX-2 induction. Our results shed light on a novel role for S1P as a growth inhibitory mediator and point out its potential involvement in the negative regulation of liver fibrogenesis. Sphingosine 1-phosphate, sphingosine, C2-ceramide, dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate, and NS-398 were from Biomol (Tebu, France). Bacterial (Streptomycessp.) sphingomyelinase was from Sigma (France). Stock solutions of S1P and dihydro-S1P were dissolved in methanol and stored at −80 °C. Freshly made dilutions were performed in 0.4% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, following evaporation of methanol, resuspension in 0.4% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and sonication. Stock solutions of C2-ceramide and sphingosine were dissolved in Me2SO, and further dilutions were made in Waymouth medium. Fetal calf serum was from JBio Laboratories (France), and pooled human AB-positive serum were supplied by the National Transfusion Center. [methyl-3H]Thymidine (25 Ci/mmol) and [35S]GTPγS were from ICN (France). cAMP radioimmunoassay was from Immunotech (France). The protein assay kit was from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were from Sigma (France). CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay was from Promega. Human hMF were obtained by outgrowth of explants prepared from surgical specimens of normal liver, as described previously (22Win K.M. Charlotte F. Mallat A. Cherqui D. Martin N. Mavier P. Preaux A.M. Dhumeaux D. Rosenbaum J. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This procedure was performed in accordance with ethical regulations imposed by the French legislation. Cells were used between the 3rd and 7th passage, and all experiments were performed on hMF made quiescent by a 3-day incubation in serum-free Waymouth medium, unless otherwise indicated. The myofibroblastic nature of the cells was routinely evaluated by electron microscopy and positivity for smooth muscle α-actin by immunohistochemistry, as described previously (22Win K.M.

The cultures were also found to express two markers of rat hepatic myofibroblasts, fibulin-2 and interleukin-6, and not the protease P100, a marker for rat hepatic stellate cells (2Knittel T.

Total RNA was extracted from confluent quiescent hMF, using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Promega, France). RT-PCR was performed on 25 ng of RNA using the access RT-PCR System (Promega, WI) and two oligonucleotides, the 3′ reverse transcription (RT) primer and the 5′ PCR primer. Oligonucleotide primers are as follows: 5′, 5′-GGC TGG AAC TGC ATC AGT GCG C-3′ and 3′, 5′-GAG CAG CGC CAC ATT CTC AGA GC-3′ for Edg1; 5′, 5′-GTG TTC ATC GCC TGC TGG TCC C-3′ and 3′, 5′-GCA GGC TGG ATG GGT GAG GC-3′ for Edg3; 5′, 5′-ATG GGC AGC TTG TAC TCG GAG TAC CTG-3′ and 3′, 5′-CAC TCG GCA ATG TAC CTG TTT C-3′ for Edg5 and the predicted PCR products of 223, 242, and 496 bp, respectively. The RT-PCRs for Edg1, Edg3, and Edg5 were performed as follows: 45 min of reverse transcription at 48 °C, denaturation for 3 min at 94 °C, 5 cycles of “touchdown” (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 67 °C, 1 min at 72 °C), and varying cycles of PCR as shown in Fig. 1 (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, 1 min at 72 °C). PCR products were size-fractionated in a 2% agarose gel and blotted onto Hybond N+ membrane. After a prehybridization in Express Hyb buffer (CLONTECH) for 3 h at 37 °C, the membrane was hybridized in the same buffer overnight at 37 °C with 50 ng of oligonucleotides complementary to sequences within the cDNAs flanked by the PCR primers, labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Edg1 probe, 5′-CCA CGG TCT TCA CTC TGC TTC TG-3′; Edg3 probe, 5′-CAT TGA TGT GGC CTG CAG GG-3′; Edg5 probe, 5′-CAC TCG GCA ATG TAC CTG TTT C-3′). After washing in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 37 °C and then for 1 h at 48 °C, membranes were subjected to PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, France). Confluent hMF were made quiescent by incubation in Waymouth medium without serum for 48 h. Cells were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) medium, scraped in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin), and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer. The homogenate was spun 5 min at 5,500 × g, and the pellet was discarded. The supernatant was centrifuged for 40 min at 43,000 × g, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer A and frozen at −80 °C until use. Membranes (10 μg of protein/assay) were incubated for 45 min at 30 °C in buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin) containing 3 μm GDP unless otherwise indicated, 50 pm [35S]GTPγS (0.5 μCi/assay), and varying concentrations of ligands. The samples were then rapidly filtered on GF/B glass microfiber filters (Whatman) presoaked in buffer C (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The filters were washed three times with 2 ml of buffer C and counted. Specific binding was calculated as the difference in bound radioactivity in the absence or presence of 10 μm unlabeled GTPγS and did not exceed 20% of the total binding. Confluent hMF were made quiescent by incubation in Waymouth medium without serum for 48 h. Cells were then treated for 24 h with either 3 or 100 ng/ml PTX or vehicle, and DNA synthesis was measured as described below. Alternatively, membranes were prepared as described above and used in GTPγS binding assays. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates, grown to confluence, and serum-deprived for 48 h in Waymouth medium. Following preincubation with 0.6 mm isobutylmethylxanthine for 15 min, hMF were stimulated with PBS containing effectors. When indicated, cells were preincubated for 60 min with either the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor NS-398 (5 μm) or vehicle (Me2SO). Samples were processed as described previously (4Mallat A. Preaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Gallois C. Brenner D.A. Bradham C. Maclouf J. Iourgenko V. Fouassier L. Dhumeaux D. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and cyclic AMP was assayed by a commercial radioimmunoassay (Immunotech, France). Confluent monolayers in 96-well plates were serum-deprived for 48 h, washed in PBS, and further incubated in Waymouth medium. Following pretreatment with 5 μm NS-398 or vehicle, cells were stimulated with the indicated effectors over various times. Release of PGE2 was assayed by a specific enzyme immunoassay as described previously (23Pradelles P. Grassi J. Maclouf J. Anal. Chem. 1985; 57: 1170-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis was measured in triplicate wells by incorporation of [3H]thymidine, as described previously (7Tao J. Mallat A. Gallois C. Belmadani S. Mery P.F. Nhieu J.T.-V. Pavoine C. Lotersztajn S.

Cells were then stimulated for 30 h with human serum following pretreatment for 30 min with NS-398, dexamethasone, or vehicle. [3H]Thymidine (0.5 μCi/well) was added during the last 8 h of incubation. Cell proliferation was assessed as described previously (7Tao J. Mallat A. Gallois C. Belmadani S. Mery P.F. Nhieu J.T.-V.

Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at low density (5000/well) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% human serum and 5% fetal calf serum (5:5), allowed to attach overnight, and made quiescent by a 48-h incubation in serum-free medium. Cells were then incubated for 3 days with 5% human serum in the absence or presence of 10 μm S1P that was renewed daily. The medium was changed for PBS, and CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution reagent was added to each well, and absorbance was recorded at 490 nm. Confluent hMF in 12-well plates were made quiescent in serum-free Waymouth medium over 3 days and were then incubated for various times with 10 μm S1P. Whole cell extracts were prepared, and Western blotting analysis was performed as described previously (6Gallois C. Habib A. Tao J. Moulin S. Maclouf J. Mallat A. Lotersztajn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23183-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. ofn experiments. Results were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance or two-tailed Student's t test, as appropriate, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Identification of the S1P receptor subtypes present in human hMF was performed by RT-PCR analysis, with varying PCR cycles. Bands of 223, 242, and 496 bp corresponding to the size of the Edg1, Edg3, and Edg5 products were identified and quantified. The results presented in Fig. 1 indicate that transcripts for the three Edg receptors are present in human hMF (Fig. 1). Coupling of S1P receptors to G proteins was evaluated in [35S]GTPγS binding assays, which measure GDP-GTP exchange on the α subunit of the G protein and, therefore, the initial steps of G protein activation by a receptor ligand. Optimal conditions for S1P-induced stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding were defined, in particular with respect to time dependence and to GDP concentration, which is added to keep the G protein in the non-dissociated form. Binding was linear up to 45 min. GDP dose-dependently decreased basal [35S]GTPγS binding (Fig. 2, inset), and the concentration required for optimal activation by S1P was in the range of 1–10 μm (not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, S1P dose-dependently increased binding of [35S]GTPγS to G proteins in membranes of human hMF, with an EC50 of 5 nm, in agreement with the reported K d of S1P for its receptors. Sphinganine 1-phosphate (dihydro-S1P), which binds and signals through all S1P receptors with a potency similar to that of S1P (24Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hla T. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), was as efficient as S1P in enhancing GTPγS binding (Fig. 2 A). We also investigated the coupling of S1P receptors to Gi/Go proteins in human hMF by using pertussis toxin (PTX), which ADP-ribosylates and inactivates the α subunit of Gi/Go, thereby maintaining Gi/Go in a non-dissociated form. Optimal GDP concentrations required to keep the G proteins in a non-dissociated form were lower in PTX-treated than in control membranes (Fig. 2, inset). This is probably due to the fact that PTX excludes Gi proteins from the pool of G proteins accessible to GDP. Under optimal conditions of GDP, treatment with PTX 3 ng/ml partially abolished the stimulatory effect of S1P on GTPγS binding (Fig. 2 B). These results demonstrate that human hMF express receptors for S1P that are functionally coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive and -insensitive G proteins. We investigated the effects of S1P and of other sphingolipid metabolites on the proliferation of human hMF. S1P had no mitogenic effects on human hMF (not shown) but dose-dependently reduced serum-stimulated DNA synthesis (Fig. 3 A). A maximal 55% inhibition was observed at 10 μm S1P, with an IC50 of 1 μm. The inhibitory effect of S1P was fully reproduced by sphinganine 1-phosphate (dihydro-S1P) (Fig.3 A). However, the IC50 values of S1P and dihydro-S1P were 1 and 1.5 μm, respectively,i.e at least 200 times higher than their EC50values to stimulate GTPγS binding (Fig. 2) and higher than the reported K d value of S1P for its receptors (9Hla T.

Direct assessment of cell growth confirmed the antiproliferative effect of S1P, with a 35% inhibition of cell growth being observed after 3 days (Fig. 3 B). The growth inhibitory effects of S1P were insensitive to pertussis toxin (Fig. 3 C), although pertussis toxin treatment was effective, since it reduced the mitogenic effect of serum. Moreover, pertussis toxin was maximally effective since DNA synthesis in response to serum was reduced to the same extent at 3 and 100 ng/ml of the toxin (Fig. 3 C, inset). Finally, hMF DNA synthesis was also inhibited by exogenous addition of other sphingolipids, C2-ceramide, a permeant analog of ceramide, sphingosine, the immediate precursor/metabolite of S1P, and by bacterial sphingomyelinase, the enzyme that hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to ceramide (Fig. 3 D). Concentrations higher than 10 μm C2-ceramide caused hMF death (not shown). The next series of experiments were performed to analyze the signaling events that mediate inhibition of hMF proliferation by S1P. We first examined the effects of S1P on PGE2 and cAMP levels, two growth inhibitory mediators for human hMF (4Mallat A. Preaux A.M. Serradeil-Le Gal C. Raufaste D. Gallois C. Brenner D.A. Bradham C.

Following addition of S1P, cAMP production rose within 5 min, maximally increased to 20-fold by 10 min, declined after 15 min, and returned to basal levels after 60 min (Fig.4 A). Stimulation of cAMP production by S1P was totally blocked by the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (Fig. 4 A) and unaffected by PTX treatment (Fig.4 B). These data suggested that S1P raises cAMP following PGE2 production by COX-2. Accordingly, S1P caused a rapid 3–5-fold activation of PGE2 production, which correlated with the time course of cAMP production (Fig. 4 C), and was blocked by NS-398 (Fig. 4 C, inset). It should be noted that NS-398 decreased basal PGE2 production, in agreement with our previous data showing that COX-2 is constitutively expressed in hMF (see Fig. 5 A) and accounts for basal PGE2 production in these cells (6Gallois C.

Therefore, these results demonstrate that S1P stimulates an early COX-2-dependent production of PGE2, leading to cAMP synthesis.Figure 5S1P induces COX-2 protein expression and activity in human hMF.

Confluent quiescent cells were pretreated for 60 min with 5 μm NS-398 or vehicle (Me2SO) and were further stimulated with 10 μm S1P over various periods.

In contrast to the results in previous studies where compound I was reported to be undetectable, both sperm whale and horse heart metmyoglobins (metMbs) formed a significant quantity of compound I, an oxoferryl porphyrin π-cation radical (Por+-FeIV(O)), during their reactions with H2O2. With both kinds of Mbs, formation of compound I was more clearly observed in D2O than in H2O. The compound thus formed was capable of performing monooxygenation of thioanisole to methyl phenyl sulfoxide and a 2-electron oxidation of H2O2 giving O2 and H2O as products. It was also converted into ferryl myoglobin (Por-FeIV(O)-globin+) spontaneously. Rate constants for these reactions and that for a direct conversion of metMb to ferryl Mb through the homolysis of H2O2 were determined. These results established unambiguously that native metMb can form both compound I and ferryl Mb upon reaction with H2O2 and that these high valent iron compounds serve as essential intermediates in Mb-assisted peroxidative reactions. The observed deuterium effect on the apparent stability of compound I was attributable to that effect on the hydrogen abstraction step in the 2-electron oxidation of H2O2 by compound I.

The oxidizing equivalent on the porphyrin π-cation radical is then transferred to the globin moiety of Mb to produce ferryl Mb (Reaction 2), which oxidizes organic compounds such as lipids and styrenes. On the other hand, oxidation of certain other organic compounds such as sulfides by metMb has been postulated to proceed via a direct oxygen transfer from compound I in a similar way to those found in peroxidase-catalyzed monooxygenation reactions and probably in the catalytic cycle of cytochromes P450 (Reaction 3) (6Ozaki S.

In this connection, Watanabe and co-workers (7Ozaki S. Matsui T. Watanabe Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6666-6667Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 8Matsui T. Ozaki S. Watanabe Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32735-32738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) recently prepared a series of site-directed mutants of sperm whale metMb, in which the distal histidine (His-64) was replaced by a variety of different amino acid residues such as alanine, leucine, and serine, and they observed the formation of compound I of these mutant metMbs during the reaction withm-chloroperbenzoic acid. With native metMb, however, it was not possible to observe the formation of compound I under the same experimental conditions; only the formation of ferryl Mb was detected. They interpreted these findings to indicate that compound I of native metMbs was formed but was immediately converted to a ferryl state by accepting a reducing equivalent from the globin moiety through the distal histidine, His-64, and therefore did not accumulate as a discernible entity. On the other hand, the transfer of a reducing equivalent from the globin moiety to the heme could be slower in mutants due to the absence of His-64. By employing stopped-flow rapid-scan spectrophotometry, we examined here the possible involvement of compound I and other high valent iron compounds in the H2O2-assisted oxidative reactions of organic compounds catalyzed by native metMb. The results have shown that compound I of native Mb is formed during its reaction with H2O2 and serves as an obligatory intermediate of peroxidative reactions. Further kinetic analyses have indicated that 1) compound I abstracts a hydrogen from H2O2 during the 2-electron oxidation of H2O2, 2) apparent stability of compound I is therefore mainly determined by its reaction with H2O2, and 3) native metMb carries out both homolysis and heterolysis of H2O2. Sperm whale and horse heart metMbs were purchased from Sigma. The metMb dissolved in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, was treated with a small amount of potassium ferricyanide to ensure the oxidation of ferrous Mb remaining in the commercial preparations. MetMb was extensively dialyzed against the same buffer and was purified by CM-cellulose column chromatography. D2O (99.9 atom %) was purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. The pD value of the D2O buffer was determined according to the relation, pD = pHobs + 0.39, where pHobs is a reading of an ordinary pH meter which employs a glass electrode (20Salomaa P. Schalenger L.L. Long F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964; 86: 1-7Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar). All other reagents used in this study were of highest grade commercially available. Changes in optical absorption were measured by using an RSP-601 stopped-flow rapid-scan system (Unisoku Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) (21Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1464-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The dead time of the measurements with the system was determined to be 5 ms by employing a pseudo first-order reaction of 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol with ascorbic acid (21Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1464-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). As described under “Results,” absorption changes observed during the reaction of metMb with H2O2 in the presence and absence of thioanisole were found to proceed in a biphasic manner in both H2O and D2O buffer systems. We therefore performed least squares fits of the absorption changes for each experiment according to Equation 1 which is given for describing such biphasic absorption changes with two apparent rate constants, k1obs and k2obs (22Hofrichter J.

The rapid-scan spectrophotometric system described above allowed us to record up to 512 time profiles of absorption at each run of the stopped-flow experiments, from which 126 time profiles at every 1.62 nm from 322 to 525 nm were selected, and they were respectively subjected to the least squares fits so as to optimize a single set of k1obs and k2obs values. Numerical calculations for the least squares fits were carried out by the aid of the techniques of singular value decomposition as described previously (21Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1464-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 22Hofrichter J. Henry E.R. Sommer J.H. Deutsch R. Ikeda-Saito M. Yonetani T. Eaton W.A.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1475-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A computer software used for the calculations was described elsewhere (21Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1464-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Rate constants for individual reaction steps, such as the decay of compound I to ferryl Mb, are not equivalent to k1obs or k2obs, but their values are obtainable from those of k1obsand k2obs according to kinetic equations shown below. Mathematical procedures for developing these kinetic equations are described under “.” Ten μm metMb (solution A) and a mixture of 100 mmH2O2, 400 μm thioanisole, and 0.8% methanol (solution B) were prepared in either the H2O or D2O buffer (200 mm potassium phosphate), pH (pD) 6.0, respectively. Then solutions A and B were mixed together with a 1:1 ratio and allowed to react for 1 min at 25 °C. Within 1 min, the reaction ceased because of a complete conversion of metMb to ferryl Mb. Then, cumyl alcohol was added to the reaction mixture as an internal standard for the analyses on high pressure liquid chromatography. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was directly loaded on a high pressure liquid chromatographic system (Jasco, model TRI) equipped with a reverse-phase column (Waters μBondasphere 5 μm CN-100 Å) and eluted with a 10% (v/v) methanol/water solution at a flow rate of 0.55 ml/min. The eluent was monitored at 210 nm. Other details were described under appropriate figure and table legends. Fig.1 shows changes in absorption spectra of sperm whale metMb in both Soret and visible regions during the reaction of metMb with 50 mm H2O2 at pH 6.0, 25 °C. The spectrum of metMb (λmax; 409, 505, and 634 nm) changed to that of ferryl Mb (λmax; 421, 551, and 586 nm) (15George P. Irvine D.H. Biochem. J. 1952; 52: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) in 200 ms without giving any spectral intermediate distinct from the two species (Fig. 1, A and B). However, we noticed that the isosbestic points between the spectra of metMb and ferryl Mb around 417, 616, and 667 nm were dubious, suggesting that one or more other spectral species could be involved in the reaction. Such an interpretation was further supported by the biphasic curves obtained for the time-dependent changes in absorption at 417, 616, and 667 nm in the insets of Fig. 1, A andB. Hence, we carried out the next series of experiments in a D2O medium, hoping that the use of D2O would make the other spectral species prominent since D2O frequently affects the rates of chemical reactions through solvent isotope effects (24Schowen R.L. Cleland W.W. O'Leary M.H. Northrop D.B. Isotope Effects on Enzyme-catalyzed Reactions. University Park Press, Baltimore, MD1977: 64-99Google Scholar) and sometimes helps to detect unstable reaction intermediates. Fig. 2 shows Soret and visible absorption changes in the reaction of sperm whale metMb with 50 mmH2O2 in a D2O buffer containing 200 mm potassium phosphate, pD 6.0, at 25 °C. Spectra at 0 ms (broken lines in Fig. 2, A and B) are those of metMb, and those at 0.5 s (thin lines) were attributable to the ferryl form. At 50 ms, the Soret absorption at 409 nm had decreased to almost a half (solid thick line in Fig. 2 A) and accompanying increases in absorption in the visible region with prominent peaks at ∼550, ∼590, and 648 nm (solid thick line in Fig. 2 B). Among the peaks in the visible region, one at 648 nm (marked by an asterisk) was unique to this intermediate spectrum not being found in the spectrum of metMb nor of ferryl Mb, whereas the other two were attributable to those of ferryl Mb at 551 and 586 nm. The Soret absorption maximum with a reduced intensity and a visible band around 650 nm are characteristic to compound I of other protoheme proteins such as horseradish peroxidase and catalase (25Dunford H.B.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32735-32738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The spectral changes observed in the H2O buffer system (Fig. 1) can also be explained by assuming the formation of the same species; the profiles of the time-dependent changes in absorption near the isosbestic points between metMb and ferryl Mb were all biphasic being similar to each other in H2O and D2O systems. Formation of a new spectral species with similar spectral characteristics was also observed with horse heart metMb both in H2O and D2O systems (data not shown). In an attempt to characterize further the properties of the new spectral species, we examined its reaction with thioanisole (CH3—S–C6H5); it has been shown that compound I of heme proteins (5Adachi S.

When the reaction of metMb with H2O2 was carried out in the presence of thioanisole, methyl phenyl sulfoxide (CH3—SO-C6H5) was formed both in H2O and D2O buffer systems in significant quantities (Table I). As seen, the amount of the product formed in D2O (44 nmol) was about twice as that in H2O (19 nmol). Formation of other products was negligible, if present. A similar result was also obtained with horse heart metMb (see also Table I). These results, together with the spectral evidence described above, indicate that the new spectral species is compound I of native myoglobin.Table IMonooxygenation of thioanisole by compound I of myoglobinMyoglobinMethyl phenyl sulfoxide formedk Sin H2Oin D2Oin H2Oin D2Onmolm −1 s −1Sperm whale19 ± 144 ± 4ND2.7 × 104Horse heart19 ± 142 ± 1ND 1-aND, not determined, because compound I in the present reaction system accumulated so scarcely in H2O, regardless the presence of thioanisole, that accurate values of k S could not be determined by the present method.3.0 × 104The amount of methyl phenyl sulfoxide, which is the product of the monooxygenation of thioanisole by compound I, was determined for 1-min incubation of 1 ml of reaction mixture, at 25 °C, pH (pD) 6.0.

Open table in a new tab The amount of methyl phenyl sulfoxide, which is the product of the monooxygenation of thioanisole by compound I, was determined for 1-min incubation of 1 ml of reaction mixture, at 25 °C, pH (pD) 6.0. The reaction mixture contained 5 μm metMb, 50 mmH2O2, 200 μm thioanisole, 0.4% methanol, and 200 mm potassium phosphate. The values are the mean ± S.D. of four experiments. The bimolecular rate constant (k S) for the monooxygenation of thioanisole by compound I was determined as described in the text. We then carried out stopped-flow rapid-scan experiments under varying concentrations of thioanisole in the D2O buffer system. When formation and decomposition of the spectral species were followed at 418 nm, the absorption first decreased and then increased, indicating that the spectral species had accumulated transiently and then decreased (inset of Fig.3, broken line). As seen, the decrease in absorption became more shallow as thioanisole concentration was raised, suggesting that the new spectral species decomposed more rapidly as thioanisole concentration increased. This finding has further supported the above interpretation that the new spectral species is compound I; it decomposes by donating an oxygen atom to thioanisole giving the sulfoxide as product. In the following experiments, therefore, we determined the rate constants for the reaction between compound I and thioanisole. Employing the rapid-scan spectrophotometric system and methods described under “Experimental Procedures,” we performed kinetic least squares fits of the time profiles of the reaction to a double-exponential function, and we obtained k1obs and k2obs, where k1obs and k2obs denote apparent rate constants for describing the absorption changes. Then theoretical time profiles of absorption at 418 nm which were drawn by using k1obs and k2obs values thus obtained were overlaid on the experimental curves in the inset of Fig. 3(solid line). As seen, theoretical curves agreed well with experimental data. Experimental time profiles at every other wavelengths examined (322–525 nm) were all well reproduced when the same k1obs and k2obs values as above were applied (data not shown), ensuring the validity of our kinetic analyses. When we plotted the parameter k1obs + k2obs against thioanisole concentrations, the plot showed a linear increase with increasing concentration of thioanisole (Fig. 3), where the slope corresponds to the bimolecular rate constant (k S) between compound I and thioanisole (see “The General Formula for Reaction Systems Involving Three Spectral Species” under “”). Values of k S thus obtained were listed in Table I. Based on all these results so far described, we conclude that the new spectral species found in this study is compound I of native myoglobin. Since it is now clear that the new spectral species is compound I, the scheme for the present reaction system can be given by Scheme FSI, wherek 12 and k 13 are both pseudo first-order rate constant with respect to H2O2 for the formation of compound I and ferryl Mb from metMb under the experimental conditions. The latter conversion of metMb to ferryl Mb was suggested to proceed through a homolytic cleavage of H2O2 by metMb (Reactions 4 and 5) (5Adachi S. Nagano S. Ishimori K. Watanabe Y. Morishima I.

The backward reaction proceeds when an oxygen acceptor molecule such as thioanisole is present in the reaction system (Reaction 3) (6Ozaki S. Matsui T. Watanabe Y. J. Am. Chem.

By using an oxygen electrode, we were able to find that a detectable amount of O2 was evolved during the reaction of metMbs with H2O2, indicating that the reaction of compound I with H2O2 actually proceeded in the present reaction system (data not shown). As described previously, the least squares fits of absorption time profiles observed for the present reaction system have given two apparent rate constants, k1obsand k2obs. When specific oxygen acceptors (sulfides etc.) are absent and H2O2is excess as compared with Mb, these rate constants can be related to rate constants involved in Scheme FSI according to Equations 2 and 3below,k1obs=(k12′+k13′+k21′)[H2O2]+k232+Equation 2 {(k12′+k13′−k21′)[H2O2]−k23} 24+k12′k21′[H2O2] 2k2obs=(k12′+k13′+k21′)[H2O2]+k232−Equation 3 {(k12′+k13′−k21′)[H2O2]−k23} 24+k12′k21′[H2O2] 2where k′12, k′13, and k′21 are bimolecular rate constants corresponding to k 12,k 13, and k 21,i.e. k 12 =k′12 [H2O2],k 13 = k′13[H2O2], and k 21 =k′21 [H2O2] (see “Rate Constant for the Decay of Compound I to Ferryl Mb” under “”). We then mathematically examined properties of the functions of Equations 2 and 3, and we derived the following relationships I—III as follows. Relationship I, parameter k1obs + k2obs linearly increases as increasing [H2O2], and the slope of the plot of k1obs + k2obs versus[H2O2] corresponds tok′12 + k′13 +k′21, whereas the intercept of it on the k1obs + k2obs axis corresponds tok 23 (see “Rate Constant for the Decay of Compound I to Ferryl Mb” under “”). Relationship II, ifk′21 is negligible as compared withk′12, k′13 andk 23, then k1obs linearly increases as increasing [H2O2], whereas k2obs is independent of [H2O2] (see “Dependences of k1obs and k2obs on [H2O2] under Condition Thatk′21 Is Negligible” under “”), Relationship III, if k′21 is not negligible, then k1obs and k2obs, respectively, approach linear functions of [H2O2], whereas parameter k1obs × k2obs approaches tok′21 k′13[H2O2] 2T.

Based on the above findings, e.g. the relationships I–III, we carried out stopped-flow rapid-scan experiments under the conditions essentially the same as those for Figs. 1 A or 2 Aexcept that the concentration of H2O2 was changed in a range of 25–100 mm. Values of k1obs and k2obs were then obtained by the least squares fits as described above. In H2O, as well as in D2O, both k1obsand k2obs were nearly proportional to the concentration of H2O2 (Fig.4, A and B). These linear dependences were reproducible with horse heart metMb (Fig. 4,C and D). These findings indicate thatk′21 is not negligible (see relationships I–III described above). In other words, the reaction between compound I and H2O2 (Reaction 6) proceeded with a significant rate in the reaction system under the present conditions. From the plots of k1obs + k2obs versus[H2O2] (Fig. 4), we also estimated values fork 23; the intercept of the plots on the k1obs + k2obs axis corresponds tok 23. The rate constants thus obtained are listed in Table II.Table IIRate constants for the reaction of metmyoglobin with hydrogen peroxide at pH (pD) 6.0, 25 °C∠ (k 1obs +k 2obs) 2-aThe symbol ∠ (k 1obs + k 2obs) denotes the slope of the plot of"

The objective of this study was to determine whether gingival fibroblasts that express endogenous α2β1 integrin, the collagen receptor, would exhibit the cellular machinery required for phagosomal maturation and collagen degradation. There was a time-dependent increase of collagen bead internalization and a time-dependent decrease of bead-associated α2β1 integrin after initial bead binding. β-Actin and gelsolin associated transiently with beads (0–30 min) followed by LAMP-2 (60–240 min) and cathepsin B (30–240 min). Cytochalasin D prevented phagosome formation and also prevented the sequential fusion of early endosomes with lysosomes. Collagen bead-associated pH was progressively reduced from 7.25 to 5.4, which was contemporaneous with progressive increases in degradation of bead-associated collagen (30–120 min). Concanamycin blocked acidification of phagolysosomes and collagen degradation but not phagosome maturation. Phagosomal acidification was partly dependent on elevated intracellular calcium. These studies demonstrate that the cellular machinery required for intracellular collagen degradation in fibroblasts closely resembles the vacuolar system in macrophages.

Although “professional” phagocytic cells such as macrophages and neutrophils have been studied in considerable depth (1Rabinovitch M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 85-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), several types of nonphagocytic cells such as epithelial cells and fibroblasts can internalize particles and matrix proteins in vivo and in culture. Collagen fibril phagocytosis is thought to be an important pathway for physiological degradation of extracellular matrix in mature connective tissues (2Sodek J. Overall C.M. Davidovitch Z. Biological Mechanisms of Tooth Movement and Resorption. Ebsco Press, Birmingham, AL1988: 303-312Google Scholar). Uterine, wounded dermal, and periodontal connective tissues exhibit rapid physiological turnover of matrix proteins, processes that are mediated by the intracellular degradation pathway (3Everts V. Van Der Zee E. Creemers L. Beertsen W. Histochem. J. 1996; 28: 229-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). While in inflamed periodontal sites, extracellular matrix metalloproteinases are believed to be responsible for the bulk degradation of connective tissues (4Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. De Carlo A. Engler J.A. Crit Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar), in normal turnover, fibroblasts are thought to use solely the intracellular vacuolar system for focal proteolysis of collagen (3Everts V. Van Der Zee E. Creemers L. Beertsen W. Histochem. J. 1996; 28: 229-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 5Ten Cate A.R. J. Anat. 1972; 112: 401-414PubMed Google Scholar). However, at present, the vacuolar system that mediates intracellular collagen degradation is incompletely characterized. In professional phagocytes, the phagocytic process is initiated by binding of particles to receptors on the plasma membrane, an event that subsequently generates a phagocytic signal (6Kwiatkowska K. Sobota A. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, the initial internalization of intracellular collagen degradation is a specific process that is mediated by the adhesive interactions between ligand and collagen receptors (i.e.α2β1 integrins; Ref. 7Lee W. Sodek J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the regulation of the downstream events and the kinetics of the intracellular phagocytic pathway following the initial binding of collagen to the cell surface (8Knowles G. McKeown M. Sodek J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 98: 551-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following particle internalization in macrophages, the resulting intracellular vacuole (the phagosome) is subsequently transformed into an acidic, hydrolase-rich phagolysosome. The transition from early phagosome to phagolysosome involves the sequential fusion of endosomes and lysosomes with phagosomes (9Pitt P.A. Mayorga L.S. Schwartz A.L. Stahl P.D. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 267: 126-132Google Scholar, 10Jahraus A. Tjelle T.E. Berg T. Habermann A. Storrie B. Ullrich O. Griffiths G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32194-32200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While there are extensive data on the phagocytic process and the regulation of phagosome formation/maturation in macrophages (6Kwiatkowska K. Sobota A. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), similar studies in the context of intracellular collagen degradation in fibroblasts are limited. Electron microscopic studies on the digestion of phagocytosed exogenous collagen have shown cross-banded collagen profiles in the phagolysosomes of fibroblasts (12Van der Zee E. Everts V. Hoeben K. Beertsen W. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3307-3315PubMed Google Scholar, 13Everts V. Korper W. Niehof A. Jansen I. Beertsen W. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 665-676Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and there is an apparent requirement for lysosomal serine proteinases for collagen degradation (13Everts V. Korper W. Niehof A. Jansen I. Beertsen W. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 665-676Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14Kielty C.M. Lees M. Shuttleworth C.A. Woolley D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 191: 1230-1236Google Scholar). A confounding factor in fibroblasts is that not all nascent collagen is secreted (15Ripley C.R. Bienkowski R.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Bienkowski R.S. Cowan M.J. McDonald J.A. Crystal R.G. J. Biol.

A. 1980; 77: 4746-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar); a significant fraction is degraded intracellularly in the endoplasmic reticulum, in the Golgi network, and in the endosome/lysosome system, thereby complicating the distinction between exogenous (i.e. phagocytosed) and newly synthesized endogenous collagen. To begin to address these questions, we have developed, characterized, and validated a model system that uses periodontal fibroblasts in which exogenous collagen binding is dependent on α2β1 integrin expression (7Lee W. Sodek J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Biotinylated collagen-coated magnetic beads were used to perform quantitative biochemical analyses of bead-associated proteins on relatively pure populations of phagosomes at different stages of formation/maturation. A major advantage of the new model system is that the bead-bound biotinylated collagen permits study of fusion processes and intracellular degradation of exogenous collagen in fibroblasts and simultaneously enables clear cut discrimination from nascent collagen that is undergoing degradation. Paramagnetic, carboxylated (1-μm diameter) beads were purchased from Bangs Laboratories Inc. (Fishers, IN). Antibodies to gelsolin (clone GS-2C4), β-actin (clone AC-15), bovine type 1 collagen (clone COL-1), cytochalasin D, colchicine, 4′-6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)1-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody, cathepsin B, trypsin, and tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin were from Sigma. Antibody to degraded collagen was provided by Osteometer (A7 clone; Denmark). Rabbit polyclonal antibody to human cathepsin B was from Vital Products Inc. (St Louis, MO). Antibody to LAMP-2 (clone H4B4) was from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA). Mouse monoclonal anti-human integrin antibodies were obtained to the β1subunit (clone A431 (Transduction Laboratories), clone 4B4 (Coulter)) and to the α2 subunit (clone P1E6 (Calbiochem), clone 3S3 (Serotec)). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-streptavidin, antibody to FITC, low density lipoprotein-1,1′-dioctadocyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (LDL-DiI), nigericin, and acridine orange were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). FITC-labeled streptavidin was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. ImmunoPure sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate and water-soluble carbodiimidine (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) hydrochloride) were from Biolynx (Brockville, Ontario, Canada; Pierce). Biotinylated collagen was prepared by dissolving 10 mg of lyophilized porcine type 1 collagen in 0.01% HCl overnight in the cold with constant stirring. Thereafter, the pH was adjusted to 8.5. Sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Pierce; 2 mg/ml) was added to the collagen in two stages and incubated for 20 min at each stage with constant stirring at 4 °C. Biotinylated collagen was coupled to carboxylated magnetic 1-μm-diameter beads using a water-soluble carbodiimidine (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimidine hydrochloride. Beads were washed with MES buffer (pH 6.0, 50 mm) three times at room temperature. 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)hydrochloride (10 mg) was added slowly after bead sonication, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and subsequently washed in phosphate buffer (pH 8.2) before the addition of biotinylated collagen. The reaction was stopped by incubating for 30 min with 10 mm ethanoalamine. Washed beads were stored in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% BSA and NaN3. Human gingival fibroblasts were obtained from biopsies of normal gingiva in patients aged between 10 and 16 years as described (10Jahraus A. Tjelle T.E. Berg T. Habermann A. Storrie B. Ullrich O. Griffiths G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30379-30390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These cells constitutively express abundant α2β1 (18Arora P.D. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and phagocytosis of exogenous collagen requires this integrin (7Lee W. Sodek J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 19Chou D. Lee W. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4354-4362PubMed Google Scholar). Cells between passages 3 and 12 were used for all experiments. Cells were cooled to 4 °C for 10 min before and after the addition of beads (cell/bead ratio = 1:10) to allow bead binding but prevent internalization. Cells were warmed to 37 °C to allow phagocytosis and were collected at different time points. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline to remove any excess unbound beads. Collagen-coated magnetic bead phagosomes were isolated by cell lysis in homogenization buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 μg/ml aprotonin, 1 μg/ml Pefabloc, and 10 mm Pipes (pH 6.8) by passage through a Dounce homogenizer (30 times) over ice and washed (four times) after magnetic selection in a Dynal MPC apparatus. Fusion of phagosomes with endosomes/lysosomes was assessed by the addition of HRP-streptavidin (120 mg, 106 cells) to cells for 30 min followed by a 1-h chase in α-MEM after washing four times in α-MEM (no serum). Biotinylated collagen beads were added to cells and incubated for 30, 60, 120, and 240 min. The phagosomes were prepared as described above and dot-blotted onto nitrocellulose paper, and HRP enzymatic activity due to HRP-streptavidin-biotinylated collagen interaction was developed with ECL reagents and quantified by densitometry. To study localization of collagen-coated beads with respect to phagosomes and endosomes/lysosomes, FITC-streptavidin (40 μg/ml) was used instead of HRP-streptavidin as described above. Since fluorescence of FITC is sensitive to pH, this dye was used to monitor the acidity of intracellular vesicles (20Ohkuma S. Poole B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3327-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar). First, we examined the FITC excitation spectra due to changes in the pH surrounding fluorescein-streptavidin conjugated to biotinylated collagen-coated beads. Calibration of the fluorescence ratio versus pH was performed for each experiment by equilibrating the cells in the presence of the K+/H+ ionophore nigericin (5 μm) at varying pH values. Calibration curves were constructed by plotting the extracellular pH (assumed to be identical to the cytosolic pH under these conditions) against the corresponding fluorescence ratio. We validated the ability of A7 antibody to recognize degraded collagen (21Nesbitt S.A. Horton M.A. Science. 1997; 276: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) by incubating native collagen-coated beads with purified cathepsin B in the presence of 1 mmEDTA and 1 mm cysteine for 4 h in phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, at 37 °C. The amount of protein on beads was determined by a Bio-Rad assay. Cathepsin B-treated and native collagen-coated beads were incubated with A-7 antibody followed by secondary antibody (FITC-goat anti-mouse antibody). Beads were assessed by fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry. Bead internalization was conducted as described above, and fibroblasts were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde for 1 h. Samples were embedded in Epon 812, and thin sections were placed on nickel grids. Sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed under an electron microscope (Hitachi-60). Counts of immunogold labeling for LAMP-2 or background counts of immunogold particles were obtained from samples incubated with secondary antibody only or with an irrelevant isotype control. Bead internalization and intracellular degradation of the collagen bound to phagocytosed beads were studied after fixation, staining with A7 at pH 7.4, and analysis by flow cytometry. Collagen and BSA internalization and surface α2β1 staining were examined as described (7Lee W. Sodek J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To examine the role of intracellular calcium in phagocytosis, cells were loaded with fura2/AM (3 μm), and ratio fluorimetry of single cells was used to estimate intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) as described (22Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Human gingival fibroblasts were presented with collagen-coated beads, and the temporal relationship between bead binding and bead internalization was studied by conducting bead binding at 4 °C with subsequent warming to 37 °C for synchronization. To differentiate between internalized and cell surface-bound beads, collagen-coated beads were incubated with cells and were later stained with antibodies for immunofluorescence localization of collagen. Since cells were neither fixed or permeabilized, viable cells with intact cell membranes excluded antibody staining of collagen beads. This approach used microscopy to distinguish surface-bound (fluorescent) beads from internalized nonfluorescent beads. With these methods, we found a progressive increase in the number of internalized beads per cell over 30 min of incubation (Fig. 1 A).Figure 7Phagosomal pH. A, calibration of ratiometric fluorescence of FITC-streptavidin-biotinylated collagen beads with changes in pH. Cells containing FITC-labeled phagolysosomes were treated with nigericin-KCl, which enabled equilibration of intracellular pH with that of the medium (n = 4).A shows the results of one of the four experiments performed. B, after 10 min of bead attachment at 4 °C, cells plated on coverslips were transferred to 37 °C, and pH was estimated by microscopic ratio spectrofluorimetry over time. Internalized beads were distinguished from external beads by the criteria described in Fig. 3. To determine if phagosomal acidification is mediated by vacuolar ATPases, cells were pretreated with 10 μm concanamycin A for 1 h followed by incubation with FITC-streptavidin-biotinylated collagen beads.

A, to distinguish internalized from cell surface-bound beads, collagen-coated beads were incubated with unfixed cells followed by immunostaining for collagen with anti-collagen antibody and FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Surface-bound (i.e. noninternalized) beads exhibited green fluorescence, while internalized beads were excluded from the antibodies and were nonfluorescent. Total bead counts and FITC-fluorescent bead counts were made by microscopy. The number of non-FITC fluorescent beads per cell (i.e. internalized beads) increased from 0 to 30 min and stabilized between 30 and 60 min.B, phagosomes were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Paramagnetic beads used for the assays were synthesized from polystyrene microspheres infused with colloidal oxide. Electron microscopy shows microspheres of polystyrene on the periphery of individual beads. There were no unbroken cells and no detectable cell debris in the phagosomal preparation.

E, α2 and β1 integrins detected by immunoblotting show initially high levels followed by a decline thereafter, suggesting that after internalization there is a loss (or recycling) of integrins from the bead.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Phagosomal compartments containing the paramagnetic particles were recovered from whole cell homogenates using a magnet (23Lutz D.A.

This procedure yielded pure preparations of phagosomes and showed little contamination by cell debris or by unbroken whole cells (Fig.1 B). Immunoblotting of bead-associated proteins at 30 min showed no significant lysosome-associated protein (LAMP-2; Fig.2 A), a marker of late endosomes and lysosomes that appeared only at later times following bead incubation. Thus, the phagosome preparations were free of lysosomal membrane contamination at the outset of the experiments. The association of plasma membrane proteins with beads prepared by magnetic pull-offs was examined by immunoblotting with an anti-annexin antibody. There was an initially high level of annexin that decreased to nearly undetectable levels by 30 min (Fig. 1 C). This observation suggested an early engagement of surface membrane with the particle surface as the pseudopod enveloped the bead, a contention that was consistent with electron microscopic studies at initial binding times demonstrating pseudopod extensions around the beads (Fig.1 D). In gingival fibroblasts, the α2β1 integrin is required for phagocytosis of collagen-coated beads (7Lee W. Sodek J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 19Chou D. Lee W. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4354-4362PubMed Google Scholar). We studied the specificity of this pathway with collagen and BSA-coated beads and with blocking antibodies to the α2β1 integrin. After 1-h incubations, there were >5-fold higher percentages of cells binding collagen beads than BSA beads (collagen = 29.7 ± 1.5%; BSA = 5.7 ± 0.3%). Pretreatment with blocking antibodies showed a 10-fold reduction of binding with collagen beads but only a small reduction with BSA beads (collagen plus antibody = 2.9 ± 1.7%; p < 0.01; BSA plus antibody = 4.7 ± 0.4%; p > 0.1). Immunostaining for surface α2 by flow cytometry analyses showed a time-dependent reduction after bead incubation (t 0 = 53 ± 3 fluorescence units;t 180 = 25 ± 6 fluorescence units). Immunoblots of bead-associated α2 and β1integrin subunits showed an initially high level that was reduced to very low levels by 60 min, suggesting that after bead internalization there was a loss (or recycling) of integrins from the bead (Fig.1 E). Collectively, these results indicate that collagen-coated beads are phagocytosed by fibroblasts through the α2β1 integrin. Immunoblot analysis of phagosomes at various stages after bead binding showed an initial increase in the amount of β-actin (0–5 min) that declined thereafter by 60 min (Fig.2 A). These increased levels of β-actin were accompanied by a parallel increase in the amount of the actin-binding protein gelsolin. For all analyses of bead-associated proteins, equal amounts of beads were assessed at each time point. Immunolabeling of intact cells with antibodies to β-actin and gelsolin demonstrated that these two proteins colocalized with internalized beads and formed a ring of staining around the bead perimeter (Fig. 2 B). Cytochalasin D, a toxin that depolymerizes actin and reduces collagen phagocytosisin vitro (8Knowles G. McKeown M. Sodek J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 98: 551-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Everts V. Beertsen W. Tigchelaar-Gutter W. Coll. Rel. Res. 1985; 5: 315-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), prevented the recruitment of actin and gelsolin to beads (data not shown), consistent with an involvement of actin and gelsolin in phagosome formation. We measured the percentage of cells that bound collagen beads in the presence of cytochalasin D (1 μm). There was no significant difference between bead binding in treated cells (23.9 ± 4.2%) and untreated cells (24.8 ± 3.2%; p > 0.2). Immunoblotting of bead preparations for cathepsin B showed a progressive increase between 30 and 240 min, while the level of LAMP-2 increased from 60 to 240 min. Thus, the enzymes involved in collagen degradation start to appear in the phagosomes in parallel with the maturation of phagosomes to phagolysosomes. Quantitative analysis of LAMP-2 localization around the periphery of beads by immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated an increase from 26 gold particles/100 μm2 after 10 min to 290 gold particles/100 μm2 after 120 min. Background counts of gold particles per 100 μm2 (no primary antibody) were subtracted in both cases, and these background counts with no primary antibody were very similar to those obtained with an irrelevant isotype control antibody. We assessed vacuolar membrane proteins associated with internalized collagen-coated beads. Cells were incubated with soluble FITC-streptavidin, washed, and chased followed by incubation with biotinylated-collagen beads. This assay distinguished internalized beads from external beads, since only internalized beads exhibited FITC fluorescence. We used LDL-DiI and LAMP-2 immunostaining to study the spatial association of endosomes with lysosomes. For study of endosome-phagosome fusion, cells were loaded with FITC-streptavidin and biotinylated collagen-coated beads, followed by labeling cells with the endosomal marker LDL-DiI. Fluorescent endosomal vesicles were readily visualized with LDL-DiI (Fig. 3 A, a). Transmitted light images (Fig. 3 A, e) showed both external beads (solid arrows) and internalized beads (open arrows); the latter were differentiated from external beads by FITC fluorescence (Fig.3 A, f). For samples obtained 30–240 min after bead incubation, we determined the number of internalized beads that co-localized (yellow fluorescence) with LDL-DiI (Fig. 4) in small vesicular bodies resembling endosomes (Fig. 3 A, b–d, 30 min after labeling; e–h, 90 min after labeling). At 30 min, there was 45% co-localization of internalized collagen-coated beads with LDL-DiI, which decreased to nearly 0% at 240 min (Fig. 4). Immunostaining for LAMP-2 showed punctate staining in untreated cells (Fig. 3 B, a). The spatial distribution of internalized beads (Fig. 3 B, b) colocalizing with LAMP-2 immunostaining (Fig. 3 B, d) also permitted quantitative analysis of LAMP-2-phagosome association (Fig. 4). There was a progressive increase in the spatial association of LAMP-2 with phagosomes from 30 to 240 min. We distinguished surface-bound from internalized probe with an anti-FITC antibody to quench extracellular FITC fluorescence. The quenching efficiency of anti-FITC antibody was determined by adding antibody to FITC-streptavidin-loaded cells followed by cell permeabilization and fluorimetric quantification. The mean fluorescence intensity of FITC-streptavidin-loaded cells was 37.2 ± 3.6 (n = 10 cells) and 36.1 ± 4.2 (n= 10 cells) after the addition of anti-FITC quenching antibody to unpermeabilized cells. In contrast, the mean fluorescence intensity of permeabilized cells decreased to 15.5 ± 2.3 units (n = 10 cells) after the addition of anti-FITC quenching antibody, indicating that the FITC-streptavidin was indeed internalized. We assayed the extracellular medium from fusion assays with biotin-HRP and found that the amount of exocytosed probe was negligible. Similarly, we studied FITC-streptavidin fluorescence at different time points (0–240 min) and found that l"

The growth factor also rapidly promoted the transient translocation of ErbB-4 to a detergent-insoluble fraction, in which the receptor was hyper-tyrosine-phosphorylated compared with the receptor present in the detergent-soluble pool. However, an 80-kDa proteolytic fragment of ErbB-4 was found in the detergent-soluble fraction, but not in the detergent-insoluble fraction. Although the heregulin-induced cleavage of ErbB-4 produced a fragment of ErbB-4 very similar to that induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or pervanadate (each of which is blocked by metalloprotease inhibitors), the growth factor-induced cleavage was not sensitive to these inhibitors under the same conditions. The heregulin-induced cleavage of ErbB-4 could be blocked by conditions that prevent clathrin-coated pit formation, suggesting that heregulin-mediated ErbB-4 cleavage occurs subsequent to internalization. When reagents that prevent acidification of endosomes were employed, heregulin-induced ErbB-4 cleavage was sensitive to metalloprotease inhibitors.

Mice lacking ErbB-4 die during mid-embryogenesis from aborted development of heart ventricle myocardial trabeculae and are also deficient in axon guidance during development of the central nervous system (5Gassmann M.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although all the EGF1 receptor family members are able to stimulate cell proliferation, ErbB-4 is also implicated as a positive regulator of the differentiation of certain epithelial and neuronal tissues (7Schroeder J.A. Lee D.C. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 451-465PubMed Google Scholar, 8Vaskovsky A. Lupowitz Z. Erlich S. Pinkas-Kramarski R. J.

Ligands for the ErbB-4 receptor include various heregulin isoforms, which also bind to ErbB-3 (10Jones J.T. Akita R.W. Sliwkowski M.X.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 345-353PubMed Google Scholar), which also binds to the EGF receptor (12Riese D.J., II Bermingham Y. van Raaij T.M. Buckley S. Plowman G.D. Stern D.F. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 345-353PubMed Google Scholar). Following ligand stimulation, the ErbB-4 receptor undergoes homodimerization and/or heterodimerization with other receptors of the ErbB family and initiates cellular responses (13Riese D.J., II Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 14Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Desensitization and down-regulation of activated growth factor receptors have an important role in regulating cellular events triggered by ligand binding and determine signaling duration and/or potency. A common pathway for down-regulation of many activated growth factor receptors is clathrin-coated pit-mediated endocytosis (15Sorkin, A. (1998) Front. Biosci. 3, d729–738.Google Scholar). In the case of the EGF receptor, the activated receptor rapidly enters clathrin-coated pits and is internalized and subsequently sorted from endosomes to lysosomes, where the receptor and its ligand are degraded (15Sorkin, A. (1998) Front. Biosci. 3, d729–738.Google Scholar, 16Carpenter G. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). However, studies with NIH 3T3 cells expressing wild-type ErbB receptors or chimeric receptors and some ErbB-expressing human carcinoma cell lines showed that all other activated ErbB receptors (ErbB-2, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4) are endocytosis-impaired and are inefficiently internalized (17Baulida J. Kraus M.H. Alimandi M. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5251-5257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Earlier studies from this laboratory showed that the ErbB-4 receptor is slowly and constitutively cleaved, producing a membrane-anchored cytoplasmic domain fragment of 80 kDa (18Vecchi M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). ErbB-4 receptor cleavage is greatly enhanced by the protein kinase C activator TPA or by pervanadate, a potent phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (19Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Vecchi M. Rudolph-Owen L.A. Brown C.L. Dempsey P.J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20589-20595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These results suggest the presence of intracellular signaling pathways that can regulate this cleavage event. Both the TPA- and pervanadate-induced cleavages of ErbB-4 are completely inhibited by the hydroxamate-based metalloprotease inhibitor BB-94. Recently, it has been shown that the tumor necrosis factor-converting enzyme (TACE) is required for TPA- or pervanadate-induced ErbB-4 cleavage (21Rio C. Buxbaum J.D. Peschon J.J. Corfas G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10379-10387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Also, a 23-residue domain in the extracellular juxtamembrane domain of ErbB-4 is necessary for this cleavage (21Rio C. Buxbaum J.D. Peschon J.J. Corfas G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10379-10387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 22Elenius K. Corfas G. Paul S. Choi C.J. Rio C. Plowman G.D. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26761-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, the exact site of cleavage of ErbB-4 by TACE is not known. TACE and other metalloproteases have been shown to be involved in ectodomain shedding of a variety of membrane proteins, including the precursor for transforming growth factor α, an EGF receptor ligand (23Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). In many of these TACE-dependent cases, cleavage can be stimulated by TPA (24Schlöndorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as reported for ErbB-4 (19Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, studies of the regulated cleavage of cell-surface proteins by hormones, growth factors, and pervanadate indicate that these proteolytic events are protein kinase C-independent and involve signaling pathways that are not well defined. Fan and Derynck (25Fan H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6962-6972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that shedding of the transforming growth factor can be stimulated by several different growth factors acting through receptor tyrosine kinase activation and the MAPK signaling pathway. In contrast to stimulation by TPA or pervanadate, the proteolytic sensitivity of the ErbB-4 receptor to ligand stimulation has not been reported. It is of particular interest to know if protease cleavage could be a mechanism for down-regulation of activated ErbB-4 receptor in the absence of rapid endocytosis and lysosomal degradation. In this study, we have found that in several tumor cell lines, ligand stimulation of ErbB-4 produces a reduction of the ErbB-4 receptor level and accumulation of an 80-kDa fragment, suggesting that a proteolytic cleavage of the ErbB-4 receptor occurs. Evidence that this cleavage may occur in an intracellular compartment is presented. Heregulin β1 EGF domain peptide, betacellulin, and heregulin were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).

The rat glioma cell line C6 was kindly provided by Dr. Mary Ann Thompson (Vanderbilt University), and the cells were grown in medium F-10 containing 15% equine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. SK-Br-3 cells were obtained from Dr. Matthias Kraus (European Institute of Oncology) and were grown in McCoy's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. T47-14 cells, transfected NIH 3T3 cells that overexpress human ErbB-4, have been described elsewhere (17Baulida J. Kraus M.H. Alimandi M. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. J. Biol.

Atrial tumor myocytes (AT-1 cells) derived from T antigen transgenic mice (27Steinhelper M.E. Lanson Jr., N.A. Dresdner K.P. Del Carpio J.B. Wit A.L. Claycomb W.C. Field L.J. Am. J.

Roden (Vanderbilt University) and were prepared and grown in culture as described previously (29Yang T. Wathen M.S. Felipe A. Tamkun M.M. Snyders D.J. Roden D.M. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 870-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Experimental cultures were generally grown in 60- or 100-mm diameter culture dishes until nearly confluent. Cell lysates were obtained essentially as described previously (18Vecchi M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, newly confluent cell monolayers in 60-mm culture dishes were incubated overnight in DMEM containing 0.5% serum. Cells were then rinsed once with DMEM and incubated with the indicated additions for the indicated times at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 20 mmHepes (pH 7.2). Next, cells were washed with Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and incubated on ice for 30 min in 400 μl of TGH lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 50 mm NaF). Lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was termed the Triton X-100-soluble fraction. The pellet was dissolved in TGH buffer supplemented with 0.5% SDS in a volume equal to its supernatant or as indicated. The solution was then passed through a syringe with a 23-gauge needle five to eight times to shear DNA and was termed the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. Prior to immunoprecipitation, the SDS concentration was adjusted to 0.1%. For ErbB-4 immunoprecipitation, 1 mg of cell lysate from the Triton X-100-soluble fraction or an equal volume of the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction was incubated with 3 μg of anti-ErbB-4 polyclonal antibody for 3 h at 4 °C before incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the immunocomplexes were washed three times with TGH buffer and resuspended in Laemmli buffer. After boiling, proteins in the samples were electrophoretically separated on a reducing SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blotting. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBST buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween) for 1 h. For anti-phosphotyrosine blotting, membranes were blocked with 3% BSA in TBST buffer for 1 h. The membranes were then incubated with either ErbB-4 antiserum or anti-phosphotyrosine polyclonal antibody in TBST buffer containing 1% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. After the antibody incubation, the membranes were washed three times with TBST buffer for 30 min and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A in TBST buffer containing 1% BSA at room temperature. Bound antibodies were detected by ECL. For direct Western blots, a lysate aliquot of ∼100 μg was loaded onto SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gels, electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted as described above. The use of potassium depletion conditions to prevent internalization by clathrin-coated pits has been described elsewhere in detail (30Larkin J.M. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2619-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 31Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). In brief, cell monolayers incubated overnight in low serum were washed once with depletion buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mmMgCl2) and incubated in DMEM/H2O (1:1) for 5 min. Cells were then washed with depletion buffer once again and incubated in depletion buffer for 2 h at 37 °C. After incubation in depletion buffer, cells were incubated with heregulin β1 or TPA in either depletion buffer containing 0.1% BSA or in regular medium (DMEM containing 0.1% BSA, and 20 mm Hepes) as the control. To determine whether growth factor binding to the ErbB-4 receptor tyrosine kinase initiates proteolytic cleavage of this receptor, as previously reported for TPA (19Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and pervanadate (20Vecchi M. Rudolph-Owen L.A. Brown C.L. Dempsey P.J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20589-20595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), several cell lines were surveyed. These included two breast carcinoma cell lines (T47D and SK-Br-3), three ovarian carcinoma cell lines (OVCAR3, OVCA432, and OVCA429), two lung carcinoma cell lines (H661 and H1155), one glioma cell line (C6), a mouse cardiomyocyte cell line (AT-1), and the NIH 3T3-derived cell line T47-14. These cells were chosen on the basis of literature reports indicating that they express moderate to high levels of ErbB-4, which is not commonly expressed in cell lines. The presence of ErbB-4 in these lines was confirmed by Western blotting, and each was tested for heregulin-induced cleavage of the ErbB-4 receptor using an antibody to a cytoplasmic domain epitope. As shown in Fig.1 A, heregulin-induced the accumulation of an 80-kDa ErbB-4 fragment in three cell lines: T47D, OVCAR3, and OVCA432. A similar-sized fragment of ErbB-4 was produced by treatment of these cells with TPA, as reported previously for other cell lines (19Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol.

In the other cell lines tested, no heregulin-induced fragment was detectable, although TPA-induced ErbB-4 cleavage was always detectable, and heregulin did induce ErbB-4 tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). Subsequent experiments were conducted with T47D cells. The time course of heregulin-induced accumulation of the 80-kDa fragment in T47D cells is shown in Fig. 1 B. Increased levels of the 80-kDa fragment were detectable at 15 min after the addition of the growth factor and were maximal at 60 min. Thereafter, the amount of the 80-kDa ErbB-4 fragment decreased. Beginning at 60 min after heregulin addition, there was also a decrease in the level of the native form of ErbB-4. This time course is similar to that reported previously for TPA- or pervanadate-induced cleavage (19Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Vecchi M. Rudolph-Owen L.A. Brown C.L. Dempsey P.J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20589-20595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). From the data in Fig. 1 A, it is clear that TPA produces a more substantial level of ErbB-4 cleavage than does heregulin. Scanning densitometry indicates that at 60 min, the amount of the 80-kDa fragment in cells treated with heregulin is equal to 20% of the total cellular content of ErbB-4. Several ligands have been reported to bind to ErbB-4 and to act as activators of this receptor. These include the α and β forms of heregulin (10Jones J.T. Akita R.W. Sliwkowski M.X. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 11Beerli R.R. Graus-Porta D. Woods-Cook K. Chen X. Yarden Y. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 345-353PubMed Google Scholar), and epiregulin (32Shelly M. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Guarino B.C. Waterman H. Wang L.-M. Lyass L. Alimandi M. Kuo A. Bacus S.S. Pierce J.H. Andrews G.C. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10496-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The heregulins also recognize ErbB-3, whereas betacellulin and epiregulin also bind to the EGF receptor. Therefore, we tested these ligands for their capacity to stimulate ErbB-4 cleavage. As shown in Fig.2 A, accumulation of the 80-kDa ErbB-4 fragment was enhanced by treatment of the cells with heregulin β, betacellulin, or heregulin α, in the approximate order of efficacy. As shown in Fig. 2 B, each of these ligands also stimulated ErbB-4 tyrosine phosphorylation in the same cells. Epiregulin or EGF, a negative control, did not alter the basal level of this fragment, and as shown in Fig. 2 B, neither of these two growth factors stimulated ErbB-4 autophosphorylation. ErbB-1 (EGF) receptors have been reported to be present in both the detergent (Triton X-100)-soluble and -insoluble fractions of fibroblasts (33Mineo C. Gill G.N. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30636-30643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), A-431 cells (34Waugh M.G. Lawson D. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and PC12 cells (35Huang C. Zhou J. Feng A.K. Lynch C.C. Klumperman J. DeArmond S.J. Mobley W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36707-36714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), whereas ErbB-4 presence in both of these fractions has been reported for cardiomyocytes (ErbB-4) (36Zhao Y.-Y. Feron O. Dessy C. Han X. Marchionni M.A. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1380-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The addition of ligand has been reported to promote the migration of ErbB-1 (34Waugh M.G. Lawson D. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and ErbB-4 (36Zhao Y.-Y. Feron O. Dessy C. Han X. Marchionni M.A. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1380-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) out of these detergent-insoluble domains. The exact nature of the detergent-insoluble domains is unclear, and in some cases, they are referred to as caveolae (37Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar). We have examined ErbB-4 movement between these different fractions to determine whether heregulin-induced ErbB-4 cleavage is associated with these trafficking events. The results, shown in Fig.3 A, demonstrate that in the absence of heregulin, all detectable ErbB-4 molecules were present in the detergent-soluble fraction (compare lanes 1 and7). When heregulin was added to T47D cells, there was a rapid and transient increase in the amount of ErbB-4 in the detergent-insoluble fraction; however, no 80-kDa ErbB-4 fragment was detectable in this fraction (lanes 2–6). In contrast, the 80-kDa fragment transiently accumulated in the detergent-soluble fraction following ligand addition (lanes 8–12). The data shown in Fig. 3 A were quantitated to show the influence of time on the amount of native ErbB-4 that appeared in the detergent-insoluble fraction and the amount of the 80-kDa fragment that was found in the detergent-soluble fraction (Fig. 3 C). Clearly, the native 180-kDa molecule appeared in the detergent-insoluble fraction more rapidly than the 80-kDa fragment was found in the detergent-soluble fraction following heregulin addition. These data do not suggest that translocation of ErbB-4 to the detergent-insoluble fraction is the mechanism by which proteolytic fragmentation occurs. It is possible, however, that the 80-kDa fragment is produced in the detergent-insoluble fraction and very rapidly migrates out of this fraction. To test this, we also determined whether TPA or pervanadate treatment of T47D cells, each of which provokes more extensive fragmentation of ErbB-4 than heregulin, induced translocation of ErbB-4 to the detergent-insoluble fraction. As shown in Fig.4, neither TPA nor pervanadate, in contrast to heregulin, brought about detectable levels of ErbB-4 in the detergent-insoluble fraction. This ligand-dependent distribution of ErbB-4 between the detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions was also examined for the tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-4, as shown in Fig. 3 B. Following heregulin addition, tyrosine-phosphorylated ErbB-4 rapidly appeared in both the detergent-insoluble and -soluble fractions. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the 80-kDa fragment was not detectable in this system. We have used scanning densitometry to compare the level of tyrosine phosphorylation at each time point in both fractions with the amount of ErbB-4 present (Fig. 3 D). These results indicate that the ErbB-4 present in the detergent-insoluble fraction is more highly phosphorylated (∼5-fold) than the ErbB-4 present in the detergent-soluble fraction. The basal level of cleavage of ErbB-4 in untreated cells (18Vecchi M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) as well as the TPA-induced (19Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or pervanadate-induced (20Vecchi M. Rudolph-Owen L.A. Brown C.L. Dempsey P.J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20589-20595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) cleavage of this receptor are all sensitive to BB-94, a broad-spectrum metalloprotease inhibitor that blocks the ectodomain cleavage of a number of cell-surface proteins. However, the heregulin-induced cleavage of ErbB-4 was not diminished by preincubation of the cells with BB-94, as shown in Fig.5 A. In this experiment, BB-94 did prevent ErbB-4 cleavage induced by TPA. Similar results were obtained with the metalloprotease inhibitorN-d-l-[2-(hydroxyaminocarbonyl)-methyl]-4-methylpentanoyl-1-3-(tert-butyl)-alanyl-1-alanine, 2-aminoethylamide (data not shown) for both heregulin- and pervanadate-induced ErbB-4 cleavages. Also, other metalloprotease inhibitors such as EDTA, BB-2116, BB-3105, and 1,10-phenanthroline did not influence heregulin-induced ErbB-4 cleavage under these conditions. Since the protein kinase C activator TPA is a potent stimulator of ErbB-4 cleavage as well as other cell-surface proteolytic events and is likely activated by heregulin binding to ErbB-4, we used the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X to test whether protein kinase C is required for heregulin-induced ErbB-4 cleavage. As shown in Fig.5 B, GF109203X blocked TPA-induced ErbB-4 cleavage, but did not alter heregulin-induced fragmentation of the receptor. The results with metalloprotease inhibitors were surprising in view of the similar-sized ErbB-4 fragment produced by heregulin, TPA, or pervanadate. This suggested either that the heregulin-induced cleavage is metalloprotease-independent or that perhaps receptor trafficking, induced uniquely by the growth factor, might modify the sensitivity of the cleavage to the metalloprotease inhibitors. Following ligand binding, ErbB-4 receptors are slowly endocytosed compared with occupied EGF receptors (17Baulida J. Kraus M.H. Alimandi M. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5251-5257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). However, this slowed rate of internalization might be sufficient to accommodate the rate and extent of heregulin-induced cleavage of ErbB-4. A widely employed technique to prevent internalization of receptors is the K+ depletion method, which prevents the formation of clathrin-coated pits (30Larkin J.M. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2619-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 31Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). The data presented in Fig. 6 show that K+ depletion effectively prevented heregulin-induced ErbB-4 cleavage (panel A), but did not prevent cleavage induced by TPA (panel B). The data obtained with K+ depletion implicate the endocytic pathway as a means by which ErbB-4 trafficking may be required for heregulin-induced cleavage of the receptor. Therefore, we assessed several inhibitors that prevent the acidification of endocytic ves"

Acta 1126, 1–16) glycosphingolipids of the plasma membrane are digested after endocytosis as components of intraendosomal and intralysosomal vesicles and membrane structures. The lysosomal degradation of glycosphingolipids with short oligosaccharide chains by acid exohydrolases requires small, non-enzymatic cofactors, called sphingolipid activator proteins (SAPs). A total of five activator proteins have been identified as follows: namely the saposins SAP-A, -B, -C, and -D, which are derived from the single chain SAP-precursor protein (prosaposin), and the GM2 activator protein. A deficiency of prosaposin results in the storage of ceramide and sphingolipids with short oligosaccharide head groups. The loss of the GM2 activator protein blocks the degradation of the ganglioside GM2. The enzymatic hydrolysis of the ganglioside GM1 is catalyzed by β-galactosidase, a water-soluble acid exohydrolase. The lack of ganglioside GM1 accumulation in patients suffering from either prosaposin or GM2 activator protein deficiency has led to the hypothesis that SAPs are not needed for the hydrolysis of the ganglioside GM1 in vivo. In this study we demonstrate that an activator protein is required for the enzymatic degradation of membrane-bound ganglioside GM1 and that both SAP-B and the GM2 activator protein significantly enhance the degradation of the ganglioside GM1 by acid β-galactosidase in a liposomal, detergent-free assay system. These findings offer a possible explanation for the observation that no storage of the ganglioside GM1 has been observed in patients with either isolated prosaposin or isolated GM2 activator deficiency. We also demonstrate that anionic phospholipids such as bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate and phosphatidylinositol, which specifically occur in inner membranes of endosomes and in lysosomes, are essential for the activator-stimulated hydrolysis of the ganglioside GM1. Assays utilizing surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy showed that bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate increases the binding of both β-galactosidase and activator proteins to substrate-carrying membranes. According to our hypothesis (Fürst, W., and Sandhoff, K. (1992) Biochim. Biophys.

The in vivo degradation of GSLs with short oligosaccharide head groups requires water-soluble lysosomal exohydrolases and sphingolipid activator proteins (SAPs). A total of five SAPs is known, and they are encoded by only two genes. One gene codes for the GM2 activator protein (GM2-AP) (2Fürst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys.

An isolated defect of GM2-AP on the other hand leads to storage of the ganglioside GM2 (2Fürst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys.

These observations suggest that the lysosomal degradation of GM1 by acid β-galactosidase proceeds in the absence of activator proteinsin vivo. On the other hand, in vitro studies have shown that the hydrolysis of micellar GM1 by acid β-galactosidase strictly depends on the presence of SAP-B or an acidic detergent (2Fürst W. Sandhoff K.

In order to solve this apparent contradiction, the enzymatic hydrolysis of GM1 was analyzed in an in vitro system, simulating thein vivo situation as closely as possible. GM1-carrying liposomes, doped with the lysosomal anionic phospholipid BMP, reported to be in the range of 4–17 mol % of the total phospholipids obtained from purified rat liver lysosomes (11Wherrett J.R.

Phosphatidylcholine (egg yolk), phosphatidylinositol (bovine brain), dolichol phosphate, and cholesterol were purchased from Sigma. Ganglioside GM1 was from Fidia. Fine silica gel Lichroprep Si 60 and Lichroprep RP18 were obtained from Merck. All other chemicals were of analytical grade or the highest purity available. Ganglioside GM1 was tritiated by the galactose oxidase/[3H]NaBH4method to a specific activity of 60 Ci/mol (14Suzuki Y. Suzuki K. J. Lipid Res. 1972; 13: 687-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TLC followed by autoradiography did not indicate any contamination of the labeled GM1. The synthesis of the GM1-sugar moiety was performed according to a method developed by Wiegandt and Baschang (15Wiegandt H. Baschang W. Z. Naturforsch. 1965; 20: 164-166Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). BMP was prepared as described previously (16Wilkening G. Linke T. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30271-30278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Its structure was confirmed by mass spectrometry (fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry). β-Galactosidase was purified to an apparent homogeneity as revealed by SDS-gel electrophoresis from human placenta following the procedure of Hubbes et al. (17Hubbes M. D'Agrosa R.M. Callahan J.W. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1 μmol of MuGal/min at 37 °C. SAP-A, -B, -C, and -D were isolated from the spleen of a patient with Gaucher's disease (18Klein A. Henseler M. Klein C. Suzuki K Harzer K. Sandhoff K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 200: 1440-1447Google Scholar). The purity of the preparations was ensured by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. The human GM2 activator protein (GM2-AP) was expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system as described previously (19Schütte C.G. Lemm T. Glombitza J. Sandhoff K. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs, for composition see below) were prepared by the following procedure (16Wilkening G. Linke T. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30271-30278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylcholine (PC), bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine, dolichol phosphate, cholesterol, and the ganglioside [3H]GM1 were dissolved in organic solvents. Appropriate aliquots of the lipid solutions were mixed, dried under nitrogen, and kept under vacuum for at least 1 h. The lipid mixture was hydrated at a lipid concentration of 2 mm in sodium citrate buffer (50 mm, pH 4.2) and freeze-thawed 10 times to ensure solute equilibration between trapped and bulk solutions. The multilamellar vesicles were pressed through polycarbonate filters, mounted in mini-extruder (Liposo-Fast; Avestin). The samples were subjected to 19 passes through two filters in tandem as recommended (20MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.Ph. M. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were produced by sonification of LUVs with a Microtip sonicator (Branson, Danbury, CT) at 0 °C for 40 min (intervals of 15-s sonification, 30-s pause) under a stream of argon in order to minimize degradation of lipids as a result of the high temperatures that occur during the sonification process. The concentration of liposomes was determined by measuring their radioactivity. The liposomes used for the assays with the GM1-sugar moiety were prepared as described above but without the addition of GM1. The standard incubation mixture contains the following components in a final volume of 50 μl: bovine serum albumin (5 μg), sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.2, 50 mm), unilamellar liposomes (LUVs or SUVs), sphingolipid activator proteins as indicated, and β-galactosidase (0.6 milliunit). The enzyme activity increases under the standard incubation conditions linearly with the time up to 50 min and with enzyme amount up to 1.2 milliunits. In the following incubations were conducted at 37 °C for 30 min. The liposomes used had the following composition: [3H]GM1 (10 mol %, 2 Ci/mol, 40 μm), cholesterol (20 mol %), acidic lipids (0–20 mol %), PC (50–70 mol %). The final lipid concentration was kept constant at 0.4 mm. The enzyme assays were terminated by the addition of 50 μl of methanol. The solution was then loaded onto a reverse phase column (RP18, 1 ml), which was equilibrated with a solution of methanol/water (1:1, v/v) with 2 mm galactose. The column was eluted with 3 ml of the same solvent, and the radioactivity in the effluents was measured in a scintillation counter. The isolation of the [3H]galactose in the assays with GM1-sugar, which lacks the ceramide moiety, was achieved by small DEAE columns (1.5 ml). These columns were equilibrated with a solution of methanol/water (1:1, v/v) and with 2 mm galactose. After elution with the same solvent, the radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. The enzyme assays using MuGal (2 mm) as substrate were conducted in a total volume of 200 μl in sodium citrate buffer (50 mm, pH 4.2) at 37 °C for 30 min containing particles of pure BMP (lipid concentration as indicated in the legends of the figures, 0–1 mm). Aggregates of pure BMP were prepared by the same procedure as LUVs and SUVs, yielding almost a clear “suspension”. However, since their microscopic structure remains unknown, we name them particles. Incubations were stopped by adding a solution of 0.2 m Na2CO3 and 0.2m glycine, pH 9.5 (1 ml). After vigorous shaking the amount of 4-methylumbelliferone was measured fluorometrically. Plasmon resonance was measured at 25 °C using real time biomolecular interaction analysis in a Biacore instrument (Bialite). A sensorchip providing a preimmobilized surface with lipophilic anchors attached to a dextran matrix (Pioneer L1-Chip) was obtained from Biacore. LUVs, diluted in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (10 mm, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, pH 7.4), were injected into the system to achieve a final signal increase of 8000 response units (RU). Sodium hydroxide (50 μl, 10 mm) was then injected at a high flow rate (100 μl/min) to remove multilamellar structures. This procedure leads to a stable base line. SAP-B and β-galactosidase stock solutions were injected at concentrations of 5 μm (SAP-B) or 20 nm(β-galactosidase) in running buffer (50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.2), respectively. For all experiments the flow rate was set to 10 μl/min. The surface charge of the vesicles was obtained by measuring the ζ potential. The ζ potential was determined utilizing the scattering microelectrophoresis implemented by the Malvern Zetasizer 3000HS (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern). The experiments were performed at 25 °C in 20 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.2. All data presented are means of at least duplicate determinations. Most single values are the mean of three determinations. All individual values are in the range of ±5% up to ±15% of the mean. In order to mimic the in vivo situation of ganglioside catabolism in the acidic compartments of the cell as closely as possible, unilamellar liposomes, carrying membrane-bound ganglioside GM1 as substrate, were used and incubated with β-galactosidase in the presence of various sphingolipid activator proteins. Optimal degradation rates were obtained for the GM1, the GM1-sugar, and the artificial substrate MuGal at an acidic pH value of 4.2 (data not shown). Several in vitro studies showed that SAP-B enhances the hydrolysis of micellar GM1 by β-galactosidase (2Fürst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys.

Transfer experiments also demonstrated that the GM2-AP did not only bind the ganglioside GM2 but also GM1 (8Vogel A. Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Eur. J.

Therefore, SAP-B and GM2-AP were tested as possible activators of the enzymatic hydrolysis of membrane-bound GM1. The lipid composition of liposomes, spiked with GM1, was varied in order to find out possible stimulatory effects of anionic lysosomal lipids such as BMP, which is specifically found in lysosomes (11Wherrett J.R.

Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). LUVs with increasing concentrations of BMP were used as substrate-bearing liposomes. In the absence of BMP, the GM1 degradation rate was only moderately enhanced by the addition of SAP-B or GM2-AP. However, in the presence of 20 mol % of BMP, SAP-B increased the degradation rate by a factor of 200 (Fig.1 A) and GM2-AP by a factor of 110 (Fig. 1 B). In order to find out whether the enzymatic degradation of liposome-bound GM1 takes place on the liposomal surface, in the surrounding aqueous solution or in both phases simultaneously, dilution experiments were performed. The assays were carried out in the presence of either 5 μg of GM2-AP or 2.5 μg of SAP-B with liposomes, which contained 10 mol % [3H]GM1 and 10 mol % BMP. In both cases, the dilution of the incubation mixture resulted in a significant reduction of the degradation rates. This suggests that equilibrium association of the proteins with the surface shifts upon solution, if the hydrolysis occurs at the liposome surface (Fig.2). To investigate further the specificity of the stimulating effect of SAP-B and GM2-AP on the conversion of GM1 to the ganglioside GM2, the effects of these two activators were compared with those of SAP-A, -C, and -D. The enzyme assays were performed with LUVs and SUVs, composed of 10 mol % [3H]GM1, 10 mol % BMP, 20 mol % cholesterol, and 60 mol % PC or with particle structures consisting of 10 mol % [3H]GM1 and 90 mol % BMP. The latter structures were prepared by the same procedure as described for SUVs and LUVs. Besides SAP-B, under the chosen experimental conditions, only SAP-A is able to stimulate the GM1 degradation to a minor degree, whereas SAP-C and SAP-D have no significant influence on the rate of GM1 hydrolysis (Fig. 3, A andB). On the basis of our proposed model for the digestion of GSLs as components of intralysosomal vesicles (1Sandhoff K. Kolter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 2Fürst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), it was anticipated that the size of liposomes might have an influence on the degradation rates of GSLs in general. The effect of the membrane curvature on the rate of hydrolysis was recently demonstrated for the degradation of glucosylceramide by acid glucocerebrosidase (16Wilkening G. Linke T. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30271-30278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.3 A, hydrolysis rates were higher when GM1 was incorporated into SUVs rather than in LUVs. This effect was mainly observed in the presence of SAP-B and GM2-AP. In the absence of these activators the degradation rates were very low in the LUV as well as in the SUV system. Then the degradation rates of particle structures, composed only of 90 mol % BMP and 10 mol % GM1, were tested. In contrast to the above mentioned results, these systems showed high hydrolysis rates already in the absence of the sphingolipid activator proteins GM2-AP and SAP-B. Therefore, the stimulatory effects caused by SAP-B and GM2-AP were diminished significantly (Fig. 3 B). Although the degradation of GM1 was very low in liposomes consisting of PC and cholesterol, a marked stimulation of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction rates was obtained by the introduction of acidic lipids into substrate-containing liposomes. Fig.4 shows the GM1 degradation rate in the presence of different lysosomal anionic lipids at a concentration of 10 mol %. These anionic phospholipids exhibited a strong stimulatory effect in the presence of GM2-AP or SAP-B. The highest degradation rates could be achieved with PI-bearing vesicles in the presence of SAP-B. Previous studies suggest that SAP-B and GM2-AP facilitate the interaction of membrane-bound sphingolipid substrates and water-soluble enzymes (2Fürst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 7Vogel A. Fürst W. Abo-Hashish M.A. Lee-Vaupel M. Conzelmann E. Sandhoff K. Arch. Biochem.

In order to rule out a possible direct stimulation of the enzyme β-galactosidase by these activators, the hydrolysis of the water-soluble GM1-sugar moiety was examined in the presence and absence of activator proteins and liposomes, spiked with different concentrations of BMP. Neither the addition of vesicles, composed of neutral lipids and up to 20 mol % BMP, nor the addition of activator proteins affected the degradation rates of the water-soluble substrate (data not shown). However, particles composed of pure BMP inhibited the hydrolysis of the GM1-sugar to 20–50% (data not shown). This effect was more pronounced in presence of SUV-like than in the presence of LUV-like particles. Comparable results were obtained when MuGal was used as a water-soluble substrate instead of the GM1-sugar. Neither mixed vesicles nor activator proteins nor a combination of both influenced the hydrolysis of MuGal (data not shown). However, addition of pure BMP prepared as LUV- or SUV-like particles caused a strong inhibition of MuGal hydrolysis (data not shown). By assuming that the association of SAP-B and β-galactosidase on the membrane surface might play a decisive role for the degradation of GM1, we analyzed the binding behavior of SAP-B and β-galactosidase toward four different populations of neutral and anionic membrane structures using surface plasmon spectroscopy (Biacore) (Fig. 5). The injection of a 5 μm solution of SAP-B resulted in a strong binding signal of 760 RU toward membrane structures that were spiked with 20 mol % BMP, whereas the association with membrane structures consisting of PC and cholesterol proved to be less strong (470 RU). The incorporation of 10 mol % GM1 to the lipid bilayers increased the binding of SAP-B only slightly, whereas the incorporation of BMP into these bilayers increased the binding of β-galactosidase to the membranes more strongly (from 135 to 240 RU at 20 mol % BMP). SAP-B, however, was not able to potentiate the capacity of BMP to mediate the binding of β-galactosidase to the membrane structures (Fig. 6). ζ potential measurements were carried out to ascertain the surface charge of the liposomes. The surface charge of LUVs containing 20% BMP was found to be −54 mV in a 20 mm citrate buffer, pH 4.2, indicating that BMP was still negatively charged at that acidic value. In higher eukaryotes, GSLs are catabolized by the sequential release of sugar units by a series of lysosomal glycosidases. It has been well documented that the lysosomal degradation of GSLs with short oligosaccharide structures requires the support of protein cofactors. A number of in vivo studies suggest, however, that the digestion of GM1 by lysosomal β-galactosidase does not require the presence of an activator protein (2Fürst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 5Kolter T. Sandhoff K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 1532-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 6Fujita N. Suzuki K.

Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 7Vogel A. Fürst W. Abo-Hashish M.A. Lee-Vaupel M. Conzelmann E. Sandhoff K. Arch. Biochem.

To solve this apparent contradiction, we tested the stimulation of the activators SAP-B and GM2-AP in a detergent-free, liposomal system at pH 4.2, which is believed to mimic the in vivo situation as closely as possible. Based on our recently proposed model for the degradation of GSLs as components of intralysosomal vesicles, the natural substrate GM1 was presented to the water-soluble enzyme as a component of liposomal membranes. Since the diameter of the intralysosomal vesicles found in the biopsy tissue of a patient with pSAP deficiency was in the range of 50–100 nm (23Bradova V.F. Smid F. Ulrich B. Roggendorf W. Paton B.C. Harzer K. Hum. Genet. 1993; 92: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), LUVs with an average diameter of 100 nm and SUVs with an average diameter of 40 nm were used. Membrane-bound GM1, as part of heterogeneously composed liposomes, was hydrolyzed to a significant extent only in the presence of both an anionic lysosomal or endosomal lipid such as BMP and an activator protein, SAP-B or GM2-AP. Even high proportions of BMP (up to 20 mol %) could not noticeably stimulate the degradation of GM1 by β-galactosidase without the addition of one of these activator proteins. Fig. 1 shows that SAP-B as well as GM2-AP stimulates the hydrolysis most effectively at high proportions of BMP (20 mol %). On the other hand, activator proteins were not needed as stimulators for GM1 hydrolysis if lipid structures were solely composed of BMP (90 mol %) and GM1 (10 mol %). A comparable acceleration of GM1 hydrolysis was also obtained with another lysosomal acidic lipid, namely dolichol phosphate. This component is supposed to destabilize membranes and is known to be a strong stimulator of the glucocerebrosidase (16Wilkening G. Linke T. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30271-30278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Indeed, dolichol phosphate was more efficient than BMP to activate GM1 hydrolysis in the presence of SAP-B or GM2-AP. In the liposomal assay system, anionic lysosomal lipids like BMP, dolichol phosphate, and PI, also stimulate the enzymatic hydrolysis of other sphingolipids effectively, such as ganglioside GM2, 2N.

In order to gain a greater insight into the mechanism of GM1 degradation, the effects of vesicles and activator proteins on the hydrolysis of the water-soluble substrates GM1-sugar and MuGal were examined. Neither the addition of SAPs nor the addition of LUVs or SUVs, spiked with different proportions of BMP (up to 20 mol %), or a combination of both had an appreciable influence on the rate of hydrolysis of the water-soluble substrates. Therefore, neither BMP nor activator proteins can be considered as direct activators of β-galactosidase, a matter that has been proposed to be relevant for glucocerebrosidase (2Fürst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar,16Wilkening G. Linke T. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30271-30278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Moreover, the addition of increasing concentrations of particles, composed of pure BMP, inhibited the hydrolysis of GM1-sugar and MuGal drastically, suggesting that β-galactosidase becomes bound to the negatively charged membrane and therefore cannot interact effectively with the water-soluble substrates in the free solution. This notion is supported by surface plasmon resonance studies. They show that both SAP-B and β-galactosidase can bind to membrane structures composed of PC and cholesterol only. Binding of both proteins is increased by the incorporation of BMP (20 mol %) and GM1 (10 mol %) into the lipid membrane. Binding of SAP-B to the liposomal surface, however, does not facilitate the binding of β-galactosidase. SAP-B, being a polycation at pH 4.2, presumably binds to the negatively charged lipid head groups of the BMP incorporated into liposomes and thereby decreases the surface charges. This could reduce its affinity for the polycation β-galactosidase. The binding of the activator proteins and/or the β-galactosidase to the membrane surface appears to be weak since the dilution of the liposome-containing incubation mixture with buffer resulted in a drastic decline of the hydrolysis rate of GM1. The hydrolysis of membrane-bound GM1 by water-soluble β-galactosidase starts obviously at the water-lipid interface of the liposomes and is strictly dependent on the presence of either SAP-B or GM2-AP (see the model in Fig. 7). Since β-galactosidase binds to the surface of lipid bilayers already in the absence of activator proteins, and activator proteins apparently do not promote the binding of β-galactosidase to the liposomal surface, the activators must have a different function. They are membrane-active proteins, and GM2-AP has been shown to insert into lipid monolayers (25Giehl A. Lemm T. Bartelsen O. Sandhoff K. Blume A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 650-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assume that they disturb the lipid organization of the adjacent lipid layer, bind GM1, and thereby lift it to the active site of the water-soluble enzyme."

The actin-activated ATPase activity of all constructs except M5IQ1 was inhibited above pCa 5, but this inhibition was completely reversed by addition of exogenous calmodulin. At the same Ca2+ concentration, 2 mol of calmodulin from SHM5 and DHM5 or 1 mol of calmodulin from M5IQ2 were dissociated, suggesting that the inhibition of the ATPase activity is due to dissociation of calmodulin from the heavy chain. However, the motility activity of DHM5 and M5IQ2 was completely inhibited at pCa 6, where no dissociation of calmodulin was detected. Inhibition of the motility activity was not reversed by the addition of exogenous calmodulin. These results indicate that inhibition of the motility is due to conformational changes of calmodulin upon the Ca2+ binding to the high affinity site but is not due to dissociation of calmodulin from the heavy chain.

During the last decade a number of myosin-like proteins have been found, and the myosins are currently organized into 15 classes based upon phylogenetic sequence comparisons of the motor domains (1Cheney R.E.

Class V myosin was originally identified in brain as a calmodulin-binding protein that had actin-dependent ATPase activity (6Espindola E.M. Espreafico E.M. Coelho M.V. Martins A.R. Costa F.R.C. Mooseker M.S. Larson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Myosin V is a member of the myosin superfamily that is expressed in variety of cell types and is involved in a variety of membrane trafficking and organelle transport functions (1Cheney R.E.

Myosin V has two heads that are connected with a long coiled-coil domain; however, in contrast to conventional myosin, it contains a globular C-terminal domain and does not form thick filaments (7Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E. Coelho M.V. Wolenski J.S. Espreafico E.M. Forscher P. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 13-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The head domain is composed of a globular motor domain and an elongated neck domain that is associated with a number of light chains. The sequence at the neck region contains six IQ motifs that have been implicated as calmodulin or myosin light chain binding consensus motifs as found in a variety of calmodulin-binding proteins and myosins (7Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E. Coelho M.V. Wolenski J.S. Espreafico E.M. Forscher P. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 13-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Since light chains play a critical role in the regulation of various conventional myosins, it has been proposed that the IQ domain serves as a regulatory component of myosin V. The role of the IQ motif and bound calmodulin serving as a regulatory component of unconventional myosins is best studied for mammalian myosin Is. For both brush border myosin I (8Collins K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20481-20486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), high Ca2+ inhibits motor activity due to Ca2+binding to the calmodulin light chain. Since 1 mol of bound calmodulin dissociates from myosin I at high Ca2+, it was originally thought that this dissociation of calmodulin was responsible for the inhibition of myosin I motor activity. However, since virtually no calmodulin dissociation is observed at pCa 6 where the motility activity is completely abolished, this view has been questioned (13Zhu T. Beckingham K. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20481-20486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For naturally isolated myosin V, motility activity is inhibited at high Ca2+, whereas actin-activated ATPase activity markedly increases in the presence of Ca2+ (7Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E. Coelho M.V. Wolenski J.S. Espreafico E.M. Forscher P. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 13-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown (14Trybus K.M. Kremensova E. Freyzon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27448-27456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) that a truncated recombinant monomeric myosin V with two IQ motifs had motility activity that was inhibited at high Ca2+, but only in the absence of exogenous calmodulin, suggesting that the inhibition is via the physical dissociation of calmodulin. Interestingly, the truncated myosin V showed inhibition of actin-activated ATPase activity by Ca2+ rather than activation, as is found for naturally isolated myosin V (14Trybus K.M. Kremensova E. Freyzon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27448-27456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy is not understood, but there are several possible explanations. Since the two-headed structure is critical for the regulation of both conventional smooth muscle and non-muscle myosin motor function, it is plausible that the two-headed structure may play some role in the regulatory mechanisms of myosin V. Alternatively, a complete neck domain may be required for the proper regulation of myosin V. The aim of the present study is to clarify the regulation of myosin V motor function by Ca2+. To address these questions, we have produced a two-headed myosin V construct, a single-headed construct having the entire neck domain (six IQ motifs), and a truncated single-headed construct containing only two IQ motifs. These myosin V constructs were expressed, purified, and examined for motor function. It was found that although calmodulin dissociation is responsible for inhibition of actin-activated ATPase activity at high Ca2+, inhibition of motility occurs at lower Ca2+ where calmodulin is not dissociated from myosin V heavy chain. Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder according to Spudich and Watt (15Spudich J.A. Watt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant calmodulin from Xenopus oocyte (16Chien Y. Dawid I. Mol. Cell.

A baculovirus transfer vector for mouse myosin V variants in pBluebac4 (Invitrogen, CA) was produced as follows. Mouse myosin V cDNA clones containing −35–1549 and 1549–3928 in pBluescript were kindly supplied by Dr. N. Jenkins (NCI, National Institutes of Health). A cDNA fragment-(1549–3928) flanked with EcoRI sites was ligated to the vector containing a cDNA fragment-(−35–1549) at the unique EcoRI site at nucleotide 1549. A unique NheI site was created at the 5′ side of the initiation codon; a unique KpnI site at nucleotide 2125 was deleted without changing the resulting amino acid residue, and a newKpnI site was created at nucleotide 3578. A cDNA fragment was excised with NheI/KpnI digestion and in-frame ligated to a PBluebac4His baculovirus transfer vector containing a hexahistidine tag sequence with a stop codon at the 3′ side of the KpnI site. This construct (DHM5), containing the entire coiled-coil domain, was used to express double-headed myosin V. To obtain single-headed myosin V with complete IQ motifs, aKpnI site was created at nucleotide 2744 of DHM5. The vector was digested with KpnI and the nucleotide fragment-(2744–3578) was removed. The vector was self-ligated and used as a construct expressing a single-headed myosin V with complete IQ motifs (SHM5). A KpnI site was also created at nucleotide 2468 or 2393 of DHM5. Vectors containing nucleotides 1–2468 and 1–2393 of myosin V were used to express single-headed myosin V that contained two IQ motifs (M5IQ2) and one IQ motif (M5IQ1), respectively. For M5IQ2, nucleotides encoding a Myc tag sequence (EQKLISEEDL) were inserted at 5′ side of the hexahistidine tag. To express recombinant myosin V, 200 ml of Sf9 cells (about 1 × 109) were coinfected with two separate viruses expressing the myosin V heavy chain and calmodulin, respectively. The cells were cultured at 28 °C in 175-cm2 flasks and harvested after 3 days. Cells were lysed with sonication in 30 ml of Lysis Buffer (0.15 mNaCl, 30 mm KPi, pH 8.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm N-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 0.2 mm N-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm ATP). After centrifugation at 140,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was incubated with 50 mm glucose and 20 units/ml hexokinase at 4 °C for 30 min to hydrolyze completely residual ATP. F-actin (0.2 mg/ml) was added to the sample and centrifuged (140,000 × gfor 20 min) to coprecipitate the expressed myosin V. The pellets were washed once with buffer A (0.3 m NaCl, 30 mmKPi, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and then resuspended with buffer A with 5 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm ATP to release myosin V from F-actin. The supernatant was mixed with 0.2 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in a 50-ml conical tube on a rotating wheel for 30 min at 4 °C. The resin suspension was then loaded on a column (1 × 10 cm) and was washed with 10-fold volume of buffer B (0.3 m KCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Myosin V was eluted with buffer C (0.1 m KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 m imidazole, pH 7.5). After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, fractions containing myosin V were pooled and dialyzed against 150 mmKCl, 20 mm MOPS,1pH 7.0, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The purified myosin V was stored on ice and used within 2 days. Typically, 1 mg of isolated myosin V was obtained. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out on a 7.5–20% polyacrylamide gradient slab gel using the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Molecular mass markers used were smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (204 kDa), β-galactosidase (116 kDa), phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), myosin regulatory light chain (20 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14.2 kDa). The amount of the myosin V heavy chain and calmodulin was determined by densitometry as described previously (13Zhu T. Beckingham K. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20481-20486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The steady-state ATPase activity was determined by measuring liberated Pi at 25 °C as described previously (19Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13146-13153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitro motility assay was performed as described previously (20Sata M. Matsuura M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11113-11118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Myosin V was attached to the coverslip. For M5IQ2, a coverslip was first coated with anti-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and then the surface of the coverslip was blocked with bovine serum albumin. Myosin V was then applied to the coverslip. Actin filament velocity was calculated from the movement distance and the elapsed time in successive snapshots. Student's t test was used for statistical comparison of mean values. A value of p < 0.01 was considered to be significant. In order to study the regulatory mechanism of myosin V motor function, various myosin V constructs were produced and expressed in Sf9 insect cells. The DHM5 construct contains the entire coiled-coil domain in addition to the complete head domain, so it is anticipated that it has a double-headed structure (Fig. 1). SHM5 has an entire head domain with complete IQ motifs but no coiled-coil domain, thus it is expected to be a single-headed molecule (Fig. 1). On the other hand, M5IQ2 contains a motor domain but only 2 N-terminal IQ motifs out of the six IQ motifs typically present. All constructs contain hexahistidine tags to aid in purification. The histidine tags were introduced at the C-terminal end of the molecule rather than its N-terminal end to avoid possible misfolding of the protein and any effects on motor function. Addition of a hexahistidine tag at the C-terminal end of myosins has been performed with conventional (21Li X.-D. Saito J. Ikebe R. Mabuchi K. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2254-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) as well as unconventional myosin, 2M. Ikebe, unpublished observations. and no influence on motor function was observed. The cells were coinfected with myosin V-expressing virus and calmodulin-expressing virus. The ratio of the two viruses to achieve the best myosin V expression was empirically determined. It should be noted that myosin V with bound calmodulin can be obtained without the coinfection of calmodulin-expressing virus but that the fraction of soluble myosin V increases significantly with calmodulin coexpression. This tendency was more prominent for constructs having an entire IQ domain. Fig.2 shows SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified constructs. Each myosin V construct was composed of a high molecular mass band and a low molecular mass band. The molecular mass of each slow mobility band was consistent with the calculated molecular mass of each myosin construct, i.e.130, 100, and 90 kDa for DHM5, SHM5, and M5IQ2, respectively. These bands were recognized by anti-His antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) indicating that these high molecular mass bands are the expressed myosin V heavy chains (not shown). The small subunits showed a mobility shift with a change in [Ca2+] that is characteristic of calmodulin, suggesting that the small subunits are indeed calmodulin. The identification of the small subunit was also confirmed using anti-calmodulin antibodies (not shown). The stoichiometries of calmodulin versus myosin V heavy chain for DHM5, SHM5, and M5IQ2 were 5.7 ± 0.7, 5.3 ± 0.7, and 2.1 ± 0.5, respectively. This is consistent with the number of IQ motifs in each construct.Figure 1Schematic drawing of myosin V constructs. The motor domain of myosin V is indicated by thefilled black ovals.

For most constructs, i.e.DHM5, SHM5, and M5IQ2, the ATPase activity decreased markedly abovepCa 6. In contrast, M5IQ1 showed no pCa dependence (not shown). Interestingly, inhibition of ATPase activity was reversed by addition of 12 μm calmodulin in assay solution (Fig. 3). The effect of exogenous calmodulin on the ATPase activity was common for all three constructs. Fig.4 shows the calmodulin concentration dependence of the actin-activated ATPase activity of the myosin V constructs. The calmodulin dependence on the activation of the ATPase activity for the three constructs was similar, and a half-maximal activation was observed at 10−6mcalmodulin concentration. There was no difference in calmodulin dependence of ATPase activity between pCa 5 and 4, suggesting that the Ca2+ effect is saturated atpCa 5. Fig. 5 shows the F-actin dependence of the actin-activated ATPase activities of the three constructs. The actin concentration dependence was similar to each other for the three constructs. K actinestimated from the actin dependence of the ATPase activity was 0.95, 0.80, and 0.60 μm for DHM5, SHM5 and M5IQ2, respectively, in the presence of EGTA. On the other hand, the actin concentration dependence at high [Ca2+] showed two phases. At low F-actin concentration, activity increased with actin concentration, and it was not dramatically different from that in the presence of EGTA. However, the activity decreased at higher actin concentrations. This result suggests that the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of ATPase activity is not due to a change in the affinity for F-actin. The binding of myosin V constructs to F-actin was examined by cosedimentation analysis in the presence of Mg2+-ATP to test further the effect of Ca2+ on the affinity between myosin V and F-actin. For all three constructs a significant amount of myosin V cosedimented with F-actin at low ionic strength (more than 50%), but no significant effect of Ca2+ on the binding was observed (not shown). The difference in F-actin dependence of the ATPase activities of myosin V at high and low Ca2+conditions is discussed under ”Discussion.“Figure 5F-actin dependence of the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin V constructs.

To address this notion, the dissociation of calmodulin from myosin V was examined. Myosin V constructs were mixed with F-actin in various free Ca2+ concentrations and then ultracentrifuged to determine bound calmodulin. F-actin coprecipitated myosin V with bound calmodulin was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the calmodulin band was quantitated by densitometry normalized with myosin V heavy chain. As a control free calmodulin was centrifuged with F-actin, but no calmodulin coprecipitation was detected. Myosin V constructs were also tested for precipitation, but no myosin V was precipitated in the absence of F-actin. As shown in Fig.6, the calmodulin bound to myosin V decreased significantly between pCa 6 and 5 for all three constructs. Approximately 55% of bound calmodulin was dissociated from M5IQ2 heavy chain, indicating that 1 mol of calmodulin is dissociated from M5IQ2. On the other hand, approximately 35% of the bound calmodulin was dissociated from the DHM5 and SHM5 constructs, indicating that 2 mol of bound calmodulin out of 6 total are dissociated. Fig. 7 shows the motility activity of DHM5 and M5IQ2 at various calcium ion concentrations. Consistent with the actin-activated ATPase activity, the motility activity was completely inhibited at high Ca2+concentrations. An important finding is that the inhibition of motility was achieved at much lower Ca2+ concentrations than the inhibition of the ATPase activity. Furthermore, in contrast to its effects on the inhibition of ATPase activity, addition of exogenous calmodulin did not reverse the motility inhibition (Fig. 7,C and D). We added exogenous calmodulin up to 59 μm at pCa 4, but the motility activity was not recovered in contrast to the ATPase activity. A similar result was also obtained at pCa 6. The recovery of motility inhibited at high Ca2+ was only achieved by reducing Ca2+concentration (Fig. 7, A and B). It was quite recently shown that the ADP release step is the rate-limiting step for the actin-activated ATPase cycle of truncated myosin V (22DeLa Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Therefore, ADP inhibition of the ATPase activity of myosin V and the effect of Ca2+ on this inhibition were studied. As shown in Fig. 8, ADP strongly inhibited the actin-activated ATPase activity both in the presence and absence of Ca2+. By using a K ATP of 1.4 μm (22DeLa Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), a K i of 1.47 μmwas obtained from the ADP dependence of the ATPase activity under EGTA conditions, whereas a K i of 1.80 μmwas found under pCa 4 conditions. This value was significantly lower than for conventional myosins (23White H.D. Belknap B. Jiang W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10039-10045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11828-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ca2+ did not affect the ADP inhibition indicating that the affinity of myosin V for ADP is not influenced by Ca2+. Except for striated muscle myosin II, the biochemically well characterized myosins have self-regulated motor function or contain regulatory components within the myosin molecule itself. The motor function of conventional myosin from vertebrate smooth muscle and non-muscle tissues is regulated by the phosphorylation of its regulatory light chain (25Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1987: 423-482Google Scholar, 26Sellers J.R. Adelstein R.S.

Molluscan conventional myosin is regulated by direct Ca2+ binding to the essential light chain as supported by the regulatory light chain (28Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1995; 368: 306-312Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the regulation requires a two-headed structure and the involvement of inter-head interaction in the regulatory mechanism (20Sata M. Matsuura M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11113-11118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Cremo C.R. Sellers J.R. Facemyer K.C. J. Biol.

Myosin I regulation is the most well studied of the unconventional myosins from vertebrates. These vertebrate myosin Is contain calmodulin as their light chains, and Ca2+ binding to this calmodulin light chain regulates their motor activity (8Collins K. Sellers J.R. Matsudaira P.T. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20481-20486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These results raise several questions concerning the regulation of myosin V. Does Ca2+ regulate myosin V motor function? If so, does calmodulin play a critical role in the regulation? Is the number of calmodulins in the myosin V molecule important for the regulation? Finally, is the two-headed structure critical for regulation? In this study, we produced three different constructs of myosin V to address these questions concerning regulation, i.e. double-headed myosin V, single-headed myosin V with complete IQ motifs, and single-head myosin V with two IQ motifs. It was reported that the essential light chain of conventional myosin copurified with myosin V from chicken tissue (31Espindola F.S. Cheney R.E. Kings S.M. Suter D.M. Moosekar M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 372Google Scholar) suggesting that it participates as a subunit of myosin V. However, the essential light chain was not found in a myosin V preparation from mouse. Moreover, it was quite recently reported that myosin V expressed in Sf9 cells that were coinfected with calmodulin and essential light chain contains calmodulin exclusively and not the essential light chain (32Wang F. Chen L. Arcucci O. Harvey E.V. Bowers B. Yuhui X. Hammer III, J.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4329-4335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore, the myosin V variants produced in the present study that have only calmodulin as light chains represent the likely subunit composition of physiologically relevant myosin V. Quite recently, double-headed and single-headed myosin V constructs similar to those produced in the present study were reported (32Wang F. Chen L. Arcucci O. Harvey E.V. Bowers B. Yuhui X. Hammer III, J.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4329-4335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It was reported that the double-headed myosin V was quite unstable and degraded during cell culture by proteolysis at the IQ domain (32Wang F. Chen L. Arcucci O. Harvey E.V. Bowers B. Yuhui X. Hammer III, J.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4329-4335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have not seen any significant degradation of our double-headed myosin V sample. Although the difference is unclear, since the degradation was found at the IQ domain it is likely that the degradation occurred due to a lack of calmodulin binding there. Consistent with this notion, the SHM5 isolated by Wang et al. (31Espindola F.S. Cheney R.E. Kings S.M. Suter D.M. Moosekar M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 372Google Scholar) increased in ATPase activity with exogenous calmodulin even while in EGTA, suggesting that their SHM5 was not saturated with calmodulin. The myosin V constructs in this study were not further activated by exogenous calmodulin under EGTA conditions, suggesting that the sites are saturated with bound calmodulin consistent with the determined stoichiometry of the bound calmodulin. All of these myosin V constructs, i.e. DHM5, SHM5, and M5IQ2, showed the same pCa dependence in their actin-activated ATPase activity. The activity was significantly reduced above pCa 6. It can be concluded that this decrease in the ATPase activity is due to the dissociation of calmodulin molecule from the heavy chain because: 1) myosin V-bound calmodulin decreased atpCa 5 and higher, and approximately 1 mol of calmodulin from M5IQ2 or 1–2 mol of calmodulin from DHM5 and SHM5 were dissociated from the heavy chain; and 2) the decrease in ATPase activity observed at pCa 5 and higher was completely reversed by addition of exogenous calmodulin. Since Ca2+ binds to calmodulin within this range of free Ca2+, the scenario would be that Ca2+ binding to the calmodulin bound to myosin V decreases the affinity of calmodulin for myosin V. However, since only 1 or 2 mol of the bound calmodulin dissociates from myosin V, the apparent decrease in affinity should be the site-specific. The nature of the binding of the IQ peptide with calmodulin has been modeled (33Houdusse A. Silver M. Cohen C. Structure. 1996; 4: 1475-1490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the absence of Ca2+, the N-terminal lobe of calmodulin adopts a closed conformation, whereas the C-terminal lobe adopts a semi-open conformation that interacts with the N-terminal side of the IQ peptide via a number of H bonds. Upon Ca2+ binding, calmodulin adopts the open conformation, thus the C-terminal lobe cannot bind to the IQ peptide. While the interaction between apocalmodulin and the IQ peptide may diminish, Ca2+/calmodulin may now bind in a distinct manner to the IQ peptide since in general it retains the amphipathic character also found in various calmodulin target peptides (34Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Kle C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). It is plausible, therefore, that the dissociation of calmodulin at high Ca2+ occurs at specific IQ sites that do not allow calmodulin to rebind at high Ca2+ presumably due to a lack of amphipathic character. The present result suggests that 1–2 mol of calmodulin are dissociated from myosin V at high Ca2+. One such Ca2+-dependent site would be the second IQ region, since M5IQ2 loses 1 mol of calmodulin at high Ca2+but M5IQ1 does not. This result is consistent with the recent report (14Trybus K.M. Kremensova E. Freyzon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27448-27456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Another possible site is the last IQ region, which is least conserved and where the second consensus Arg that interacts via three H bonds with the N-terminal lobe of calmodulin (according to the model (33Houdusse A. Silver M. Cohen C. Structure. 1996; 4: 1475-1490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar)) is replaced by Lys. It is of interest to identify how Ca2+ decreases the actin-activated ATPase activity. Actin binding of myosin V in the presence of ATP was unchanged with Ca2+; therefore, Ca2+ does not alter its affinity for F-actin. It was reported quite recently (21Li X.-D. Saito J. Ikebe R. Mabuchi K. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2254-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that the rate-limiting step of the unregulated truncated myosin V construct, i.e. (M5IQ1), is the ADP off step. We examined the effect of ADP on the inhibition of the ATPase activity, but the apparent K i value was not influenced by Ca2+. Interestingly, an inhibition of ATPase activity was observed at high, but not low, F-actin concentration in the presence of Ca2+. For conventional myosin it is known that the inhibition of ATPase activity by high F-actin concentrations is due to the inhibition of the ATP hydrolysis step by F-actin (35Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiochu F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is plausible that the inhibition of the ATPase activity by Ca2+ for myosin V is due to an inhibition of ATP hydrolysis step. The inhibition of the actin-activated ATPase activity was completely reversed by the presence of micromolar levels of calmodulin. Since a concentration of free calmodulin of several micromolar is present in cells, the inhibition of ATPase activity may not be operating in vivo. An important finding is that the motility of myosin V (DHM5) is completely abolished below pCa 6 where no apparent dissociation of calmodulin takes place. Furthermore, addition of a high concentration of exogenous calmodulin failed to rescue this inhibition of motility. These results indicate that the inhibition of the motility of myosin V is not due to dissociation of calmodulin from the heavy chain. The inhibition occurs between pCa 7 and 6 where cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration is regulated in most cell types; therefore, the observed inhibition is physiologically relevant. Similar results were reported for mammalian myosin Iβ (12Zhu T. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 13Zhu T. Beckingham K. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20481-20486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Since this range of Ca2+ concentrations corresponds to the high affinity C-terminal sites of calmodulin, it is likely that Ca2+ binding to the C-terminal lobe of calmodulin and consequent conformational changes are responsible for the inhibition of motility. Supporting this notion, it was shown that deletion of the C-terminal Ca2+-binding sites abolishes inhibition of the motility of myosin Iβ (13Zhu T. Beckingham K. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20481-20486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Quite recently, it was reported that truncated myosin V containing 2 IQ motifs showed motility activity even at high Ca2+ when high exogenous calmodulin was present although the velocity of the motility is reduced (14Trybus K.M. Kremensova E. Freyzon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27448-27456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). At present the reason of this apparent discrepancy between the present result and that by Trybus et al. (14Trybus K.M. Kremensova E. Freyzon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27448-27456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) is obscure. The loss of the motility at high Ca2+ was not due to the denaturation of myosin V since the perfusion of the flow cell with low Ca2+ buffer (pCa 7 or less) completely restored the motility (Fig. 7). We examined various exogenous calmodulin concentrations up to 59 μm that is 5 times higher than that used by Trybus et al. (14Trybus K.M. Kremensova E. Freyzon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27448-27456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); therefore, it is unlikely that the loss of the motility is due to the unsaturation of the bound calmodulin. Actually, the inhibition of the motility is observed at pCa 6, where virtually no calmodulin is dissociated from myosin V heavy chain. The present results suggest that true regulation of motility could require two N-terminal IQ domains, in which the conformational change of calmodulin, but not the physical dissociation of calmodulin, would trigger the inhibition of motility. There is an apparent de-coupling between the ATP hydrolysis cycle and mechanical events at higher Ca2+. This is different from the regulation of conventional myosins in which the regulatory domain regulates both ATPase and mechanical activities (25Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1987: 423-482Google Scholar, 26Sellers J.R. Adelstein R.S. Enzymes. 1987; 18: 381-418Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 27Tan J.L. Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 721-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 28Xie X.

It is plausible that the change in calmodulin conformation alters the rigidity of the ”lever arm“ and thus decouples the chemical and mechanical events. Alternatively, the conformational change of calmodulin could alter the interaction between calmodulin and the ”converter“ domain of myosin V, thus inhibiting motility. The present results clearly indicate that the two-headed structure is not critical for regulation of mechanoenzymatic activity of myosin V. This is distinct from the regulation of conventional myosin, in which an interaction between the two heads is involved in the regulation (20Sata M. Matsuura M. Ikebe M.

Although this pathway can be studied in vivo and in crude cell-free systems, a deeper understanding of the mechanism requires reconstitution with purified enzymes. We have expressed and purified a complex of two proteins that are critical for double-strand break repair, DNA ligase IV (DNL IV) and XRCC4. The complex is homogeneous, with a molecular mass of about 300,000 Da, suggestive of a mixed tetramer containing two copies of each polypeptide. The presence of multiple copies of DNL IV was confirmed in an experiment where different epitope-tagged forms of DNL IV were recovered simultaneously in the same complex. Cross-linking suggests that an XRCC4·XRCC4 dimer interface forms the core of the tetramer, and that the DNL IV polypeptides are in contact with XRCC4 but not with one another. Purified DNL IV·XRCC4 complex functioned synergistically with Ku protein, the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, and other repair factors in a cell-free end-joining assay. We suggest that a dyad-symmetric DNL IV·XRCC4 tetramer bridges the two ends of the broken DNA and catalyzes the coordinate ligation of the two DNA strands.

DSBs can also be produced by the action of radiomimetic drugs and by certain recombination endonucleases. DSBs are among the most lethal forms of DNA damage. Unrepaired DSBs create acentric chromosomal fragments that are lost in subsequent cell divisions, leading to aneuploidy or cell death. All eukaryotic cells have efficient mechanisms for DSB repair. This repair can proceed by a recombination mechanism, mediated by the Rad51 protein and other gene products, or it can proceed via a nonhomologous end-joining pathway (1Chu G. J. Biol.

In human cells, NHEJ involves the concerted action of several proteins.

There may also be involvement of other, as yet unidentified, proteins that are required for assembly of the repair complex, anchoring of the free DNA ends, or coupling of repair to cellular signaling pathways. The biochemistry of the NHEJ reaction remains incompletely understood. Several systems have been described that permit re-creation of the reaction in cell free extracts from somatic cells or Xenopuseggs (23Pfeiffer P. Vielmetter W.

However, crude systems have a limited potential for mechanistic studies, and it is therefore an important goal to obtain all of the components of the NHEJ system in pure and active form. The current study focuses on the DNA ligase component. DNL IV is one of three isoforms of nuclear DNA ligase found in human cells (28Wei Y.F. Robins P. Carter K. Caldecott K. Pappin D.J., Yu, G.L.

Although all three ligases are ATP-dependent and share a conserved catalytic core, DNL IV has several unique features (30Tomkinson A.E. Levin D.S. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 34Tomkinson A.E. Mackey Z.B. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 37Bork P. Hofmann K.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Most significantly, DNL IV has an obligate partner protein, XRCC4, is required for biological function (39Critchlow S.E.

Cells lacking either DNL IV or XRCC4 are radiation-sensitive and are unable to complete V(D)J recombination, which involves a DSB intermediate and is required for the development of the adaptive immune system (20Grawunder U.

Mice lacking DNL IV or XRCC4 display an additional phenotype of a high level of apoptosis in the developing nervous system (22Frank K.M. Sekiguchi J.M. Seidl K.J. Swat W. Rathbun G.A. Cheng H.L. Davidson L. Kangaloo L. Alt F.W. Nature. 1998; 396: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 42Gao Y. Sun Y. Frank K.M. Dikkes P. Fujiwara Y. Seidl K.J. Sekiguchi J.M. Rathbun G.A. Swat W.

Cell. 1998; 95: 891-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The reason for this phenotype is unclear, but it could be due to high sensitivity to unrepaired DSBs in developing neurons. The native molecular weight of the DNL IV·XRCC4 complex is uncertain and has been the subject of conflicting estimates (29Robins P. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24257-24261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 39Critchlow S.E. Bowater R.P. Jackson S.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 588-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Moreover, although XRCC4 stabilizes DNL IV and enhances its enzymatic activity, it is not clear if it plays a fundamental role in the reaction mechanism, and if so, why DNL IV requires this cofactor and other ligases do not. In the present study, we use multiple, independent approaches to demonstrate that the active form of the DNL IV·XRCC4 complex is a heterotetramer. Cross-linking suggests that an XRCC4 dimer forms the structural core of the complex and is therefore responsible for maintaining the tetrameric state. We suggest that the presence of two ligase active sites within the complex is an adaptation that permits the two strands of DNA to be ligated in a coordinated manner. DNL IV (accession no. AA081632) and XRCC4 (accession no. R14027) cDNA clones were obtained from the Image Consortium (clone ID IMAGE 547947 (5′) and IMAGE 26811 (5′), respectively). The DNL IV clone contained the complete coding sequence, which was amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), primer 1, d(GATCGTCGACACCATGGCTGCCTCACAAACT), and primer 2, d(AATTGTCGACTTAATGATGATGATGATGATGAATCAAATACTGGTTTTC). The primers introduced a 6-histidine tag at the 3′ end of the open reading frame and SalI sites at both ends of the amplified fragment. This fragment was digested with SalI and inserted into theSalI site of pCITE-4a(+) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The resulting plasmid was digested with BamHI andNotI, and the DNL IV-encoding fragment was inserted at the corresponding sites of the pVL1392 baculovirus transfer vector (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). The DNL IV(His)6 polypeptide has a predicted molecular mass of 104,747 Da. In some experiments, where noted, FLAG and Myc epitope-tagged variants of DNL IV were used. To construct these, a PCR reaction was performed using the DNL IV-His6 clone in the pCITE-4a(+) vector as template, primer 1, and primer 3, d(CGGACGCGTGAATCAAATACTGGTT). These amplify the DNL IV coding sequence with deletion of the His6 tag and the addition of an MluI site at the 3′ end. To construct the FLAG-tagged variant, the PCR product was inserted into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and the resulting clone was digested with EcoRI and subcloned into pCITE-4a(+) to provide flanking restriction sites. A short DNA fragment downstream of the 3′ end of the DNL IV gene was excised by digestion with MluI and NotI, and a double-stranded oligonucleotide consisting of d(CGCGTCCGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGTAAGC) and d(GGCCGCTTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGGA) was inserted. This results in the addition of a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) at the C terminus of DNL IV. The resulting plasmid was digested with BamHI andNotI, and the DNL IV-FLAG encoding fragment was inserted into the corresponding sites of the pVL1393 baculovirus transfer vector (PharMingen). To construct the Myc-tagged variant, PCR was performed using DNL IV-(His)6 in pCITE-4a(+), primer 1, and primer 3. The amplified fragment was digested with SalI andMluI and was inserted into the corresponding sites of the pMS211 vector (48Sadofsky M.J. Hesse J.E. Gellert M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1805-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This results in the addition of three tandem Myc epitope sequences (EQKLISEEDL) at the C terminus of the protein. The resulting plasmid was digested with SalI and NotI to release the DNL IV-Myc coding fragment, which was inserted into the corresponding sites of the pCITE-4a(+) vector. ABamHI-NotI fragment was subcloned into pVL1393 as described above. The XRCC4 clone obtained from the Image Consortium was sequenced, and it was determined that this clone contained only the 3′ region of the gene. In an attempt to obtain the entire gene, total HeLa cell RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) and reverse transcription-PCR was performed using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase and Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The primers used for this experiment, d(GATCGGATCCACCATGGGCTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTCATATGGAGAGAAAAATAAGC) and d(AGTGGGATCCTTAAATCTCATCAAAGAG), amplify the entire XRCC4 open reading frame and introduce a hemagglutinin epitope tag at the 5′ end (YPYDVPDYA). The amplified fragment was inserted into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). DNA sequencing showed that several base changes had been introduced into the 3′ region of the XRCC4 gene. To correct these, the plasmid containing the amplified XRCC4 gene was digested with EcoRI, and the resulting fragment was subcloned into pCITE-4a(+). A PstI-NotI fragment encompassing the 3′ region of XRCC4 was excised and replaced with a corresponding fragment from the Image Consortium XRCC4 clone. The resulting plasmid was digested with BamHI andNotI, and the XRCC4-encoding fragment was subcloned into the corresponding sites of the pVL1393 baculovirus transfer vector (PharMingen). The HA-XRCC4 polypeptide has a predicted molecular mass of 39,389 Da. In some experiments, where noted, a FLAG-tagged variant of XRCC4 was used. The plasmid containing the complete HA-XRCC4 gene in pCITE-4a(+) was digested with NdeI and NotI to excise the XRCC4 coding sequence (removing the HA tag), and the resulting fragment was subcloned into the corresponding sites of the pSK277 baculovirus transfer vector (49Koh S.S. Hengartner C.J. Young R.A. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), resulting in the addition of a FLAG tag at the N terminus. To generate viral stocks, transfer vectors encoding DNL IV and XRCC4 were transfected, together with linearized AcNPV baculovirus DNA (PharMingen), into Sf9 insect cells using a liposome-mediated method (Cellfectin, Life Technologies, Inc.). Recombinant baculovirus stocks were amplified separately to a titer of at least 5 × 107 plaque-forming units/ml. Protein expression was confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-histidine antibody (mAb Tetra-His; Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and anti-HA antibody (mAb 12CA5; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Recombinant DNL IV and XRCC4-expressing baculoviruses were used to co-infect 3 L ofSf9 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 5. After 60 h, Sf9 cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 90 ml of lysis buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol). The suspension was sonicated and then centrifuged for 1 h at 150,000 ×g. The supernatant was mixed with 10 ml (packed volume) of Ni+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with rotation. The Ni+-NTA-agarose was packed into a column, washed with lysis buffer, and eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole (0–500 mm) in lysis buffer. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the presence of DNL IV and XRCC4 was determined by immunoblotting. Fractions containing these proteins (which eluted at approximately 0.12 m imidazole) were pooled and dialyzed against CB buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% Tween 20, 5% glycerol) containing 0.35 m KCl. The dialyzed protein (14 ml) was loaded onto a Superdex 200 (26/60) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been pre-equilibrated with CB buffer containing 0.35 m KCl. Fractions containing DNL IV and XRCC4 were pooled and dialyzed against TM buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) containing 0.1 m KCl. The material from the Superdex 200 column was divided in half, and each half was loaded onto a Mono Q (HR 5/5) column pre-equilibrated with TM buffer containing 0.1m KCl. The column was washed and eluted with a linear gradient of KCl (0.1–0.6 m) in TM buffer. Fractions containing DNL IV and XRCC4 (which eluted together at about 0.275m KCl) were adjusted to 15% glycerol, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. To purify FLAG-tagged DNL IV·XRCC4, which was used in one experiment where noted, recombinant DNL IV-FLAG and FLAG-XRCC4-expressing baculoviruses were used to co-infect Sf9 cells. The pellet from 0.5 liter of culture was suspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (as described in the preceding paragraph except with 0.1 mNaCl), sonicated, and centrifuged. The supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml Q-Sepharose FF column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated with lysis buffer containing 0.1 m KCl. The column was washed and eluted with lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. Pooled DNL IV-XRCC4-containing fractions were loaded onto a Superdex 200 (16/60) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer containing 0.35 m NaCl. Fractions were pooled that contained the DNL IV·XRCC4 complex (excluding fractions containing free XRCC4), and these were subjected to Mono Q chromatography. Gel filtration chromatography was performed using a Superdex 200 (26/60) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using TM buffer containing 0.275m KCl. To construct a calibration curve, a set of standard proteins was analyzed (high and low molecular weight gel filtration calibration kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). TheK av parameter was determined (K av = (Ve −Vo)/(Vt −Vo), where Ve represents elution volume, Vo represents void volume, andVt represents total bed volume). TheK av values for standard proteins were plotted as a function of the logarithm of molecular weight, and the resulting calibration curve was used to derive a molecular weight for the DNL IV·XRCC4 complex. Native molecular weight was also determined by the method of Ferguson (50Ferguson K.A. Metabolism. 1964; 13: 985-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Native gel electrophoresis was performed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris base, 40 mm boric acid, and 10 mm EDTA. Standard and unknown proteins were analyzed on a series of gels containing different concentrations of polyacrylamide (4%, 5%, 5.5%, 6%, 8%, and 10%). Relative mobility (Rf) was calculated as the ratio of mobility of a given protein to the mobility of bromphenol blue dye. For each protein, a derived value, 100[log (Rf × 100)], was plotted as a function of acrylamide concentration (51Chrambach A. Rodbard D. Science. 1971; 172: 440-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 52Hedrick J.L. Smith A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). The slopes of the lines generated for each standard protein were determined by linear regression analysis and were plotted as a function of the logarithm molecular weight. This calibration curve (a “Ferguson plot”) was applied to determine the native molecular weight of the DNL IV·XRCC4 complex. Antibody-conjugated Sepharose was prepared by incubation of purified mAb 9E10 (gift of M. Sadofsky, Medical College of Georgia) with CNBr activated Sepharose 6MB (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Coupling was performed overnight at 4 °C in a buffer containing 0.1m NaHCO3, pH 8.3, and 0.5 m NaCl. The reaction was stopped by washing with the same buffer lacking antibody. The beads were blocked by incubating with 1.2 methanolamine for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were washed in 0.1 m NaOAc, pH 4.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl, then with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.5m NaCl. This cycle of washing was repeated twice more. A triple coinfection was performed using 1 liter of Sf9 cells and baculoviruses encoding the DNL IV-His6, DNL IV-Myc, and HA-XRCC4 polypeptides. Each virus was used at a multiplicity of infection of about 5. An extract was prepared and subjected to Ni+-NTA-agarose chromatography as described above. Protein from a peak fraction was incubated with mAb 9E10 anti-Myc Sepharose overnight at 4 °C in a buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.3% Nonidet P-40. The beads were washed three times with the same buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Adenylation reactions were performed in a final volume of 10 μl. Reactions contained 2 μl of a ligase-containing protein fraction, and in addition contained 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reactions were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and terminated by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Adenylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by PhosphorImager analysis. Nick-ligation reactions were performed using a (dT)16substrate, which was 5′ end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol). The radiolabeled (dT)16 was hybridized with a stoichiometric amount of poly(dA) (200-nt average length, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ligation reactions were performed in a volume of 5 μl, and contained 1 ng of DNA substrate, 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml BSA, and 1 mm ATP. In addition, reactions contained 1 μl of ligase-containing fraction, which was diluted with TM buffer containing 0.275 m KCl to give the amount of protein indicated in the legend to Fig. 6. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and stopped by addition of 95% formamide loading dye. Products were analyzed by 20% urea-PAGE. The gel was fixed with 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and the products were visualized by PhosphorImager analysis. Chemical cross-linking reactions were performed using a homobifunctional N-hydroxysuccinimide ester cross-linker that had an 11.4-Å arm length (BS3, Pierce). Reactions were assembled by mixing 10 μl of protein-containing fractions, 10 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (27 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 137 mmNaCl, 43 mm Na2HPO4), and 2 μl of aqueous BS3 solution. Final BS3 concentrations were as indicated in the relevant figure. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and terminated by adjusting to 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Cross-linked products were resolved by 5% and 7% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting, using anti-histidine tag (mAb Tetra-His; Qiagen) and anti-HA (mAb 12CA5; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) primary antibodies. Immunoblots were incubated with the appropriately conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies and were developed as indicated in the legend to Fig5.Figure 6Nick-ligation assay using purified DNL IV·XRCC4 complex.

Some heparin preparations can interact with L- and P-selectin; however, the determinants required for inhibiting selectin-mediated cell adhesion have not yet been characterized.

Moreover, carboxyl-reduced and sulfated heparin and trestatin A sulfate were also active in vivo, as assessed by experiments showing 1) that microinfusion of trestatin A sulfate reduced by 96% leukocyte rolling along rat mesenteric postcapillary venules and 2) that both compounds inhibited (by 58–81%) neutrophil migration into thioglycollate-inflamed peritoneum of BALB/c mice.

Heparin is a glycosaminoglycan composed of alternating d-glucosamine and uronic acid (L-iduronic or d-glucuronic acid) residues that are heterogeneous in size and degree of sulfation. The heparin anticoagulant effect is caused by antithrombin activation, a reaction that follows a conformational change that takes place when the serpin binds to a specific pentasaccharide sequence. In contrast, little information is available on the structural determinants required for L-selectin and P-selectin binding. The beneficial effects of selectin inhibitors in animal models of ischemia/reperfusion injury (for example in models of myocardial infarction, stroke, traumatic shock or solid organ transplantation) suggest that heparin or heparin-like compounds could be helpful in inhibiting selectin function and preventing tissue damage (48Lefer A.M.

However, heparin anticoagulant properties and the potential of bleeding complications may contraindicate its use as an antiadhesive compound. In this study, we have examined whether the antithrombin-mediated anticoagulant activity of heparin could be separated from its anti-selectin activity. Two compounds with high anti-L-selectin and anti-P-selectin activity but negligible anticoagulant activity were identified including a chemically modified (carboxyl-reduced and sulfated) form of heparin and the non-uronic pseudo-nonasaccharide trestatin A sulfate. Furthermore, the anti-selectin activities of these compounds were compared with those of three unfractionated (UFH) and three low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) preparations approved for anticoagulant therapy in clinical practice.DISCUSSIONSeveral studies have indicated that L-selectin and P-selectin can interact with heparin and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains. Fragments of heparin that bind to L-selectin include the more heavily sulfated and epimerized regions (42Norgard-Sumnicht K.E. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12012-12024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 46Koenig A. Norgard-Sumnicht K. Linhardt R. Varki A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). P-selectin binding fragments contain these regions but also less modified fragments. The present study has examined the structural requirements for L-selectin or P-selectin binding to heparin. Our main observations are that: 1) the heparin derivative CRS-heparin, devoid of antithrombin-mediated anticoagulant activity, exhibits high anti-L-selectin and anti-P-selectin activity; 2) trestatin A sulfate, a non-uronic pseudo-nonasaccharide obtained by sulfation of trestatin A, also possesses high anti-L-selectin and anti-P-selectin activity; 3) when tested in two animal models of experimental inflammation, both CRS-heparin and trestatin A sulfate exhibit strong anti-inflammatory activity as a result of inhibition of L-selectin- and P-selectin-mediated cell adhesion. From this finding it can be concluded that 1) the carboxylates in heparin can be replaced by a primary O-sulfate group to obtain heparin derivatives that inhibit L-selectin or P-selectin activity, and 2) antithrombin-dependent anticoagulant activity of heparin is not required for anti-selectin activity.Control heparin partially inhibited binding of recombinant L-selectin/μ and P-selectin/μ chimeric proteins to KG-1 cells (Fig.2), a reaction almost completely dependent on the interaction of L-selectin or P-selectin with PSGL-1 (14Spertini O.

As control heparin inhibited both selectins, it is possible that L-selectin and P-selectin have similar heparin binding domains. It has been suggested that appropriate sulfation and carboxylation of heparin play a critical role in selectin recognition (42Norgard-Sumnicht K.E. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12012-12024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 46Koenig A. Norgard-Sumnicht K. Linhardt R. Varki A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In cell rolling assays, control heparin efficiently inhibited PSGL-1-mediated U937 cell rolling on P-selectin (Fig. 4), an interaction dependent on post-translational modifications of PSGL-1 including tyrosine sulfation and expression of sialylated and fucosylated O-glycans on threonine 57 (22). In contrast, control heparin did not inhibit L-selectin-mediated rolling on PSGL-1 (Fig. 6). This difference may result from differences in L-selectin and P-selectin binding sites for heparin or PSGL-1. As expected, control heparin did not affect E-selectin-mediated interactions.Earlier studies have shown that inhibition of arterial smooth muscle proliferation by heparin is independent from its anticoagulant activity and that the carboxyl group of the uronic acid unit is not essential for antiproliferative activity (56Wessel H.P. Hosang M. Tschopp T.B. Weimann B.-J. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 204: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 64Castellot J.J.J. Beeler D.L. Rosenberg R.D. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 120: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To determine if the carboxyl group of the uronic acid units were required for anti-selectin activity, we compared the inhibitory activities of control heparin and CR-heparin. The anti-P-selectin and anti-L-selectin activity of control heparin was lost after carboxyl reduction (Figs. 2 and 4) indicating that the uronic acid unit 2-O-sulfate groups and thed-glucosamine unit 2-N-,6-O-sulfate groups are not sufficient for this activity. Another possible interpretation is that, by removal of the carboxyl group, just one of the several charges required for efficient P-selectin and L-selectin binding, have been removed. This would be in agreement with stronger binding to L-selectin and P-selectin observed after introduction of a sulfate group in CRS-heparin, prepared by sulfation of the carboxyl-reduced group of CR-heparin (Figs. 2, 4, and 6). Importantly and in contrast to control heparin, CRS-heparin had no antithrombin-dependent anticoagulant activity (56Wessel H.P. Hosang M. Tschopp T.B. Weimann B.-J. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 204: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, requirements for antithrombin binding are different from those necessary for L-selectin or P-selectin binding (65Thunberg L. Backstrom G. Lindahl U. Carbohydr. Res. 1982; 100: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 66Razi N. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

Sulfation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans may also be important to support L-selectin binding (40Giuffrè L. Cordey A.-S. Monai N. Tardy Y. Schapira M. Spertini O. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12012-12024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Since an intact uronic acid unit is not required for inhibiting L-selectin or P-selectin binding to PSGL-1, we examined the anti-selectin activity of trestatin A sulfate, a highly sulfated pseudo-nonasaccharide with antiproliferative activity on arterial smooth muscle cells (56Wessel H.P. Hosang M. Tschopp T.B. Weimann B.-J. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 204: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Trestatin A sulfate exhibited high anti-L-selectin and anti-P-selectin activities (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). Trestatin A sulfate was very efficient at inhibiting L-selectin-mediated rolling on PSGL-1, whereas CRS-heparin had a much weaker effect on this reaction and control heparin was completely inactive (Fig. 6). In vivo, the inhibitory activity of trestatin A sulfate on neutrophil rolling along postcapillary venules disappeared quickly upon termination of microinfusion. Transient inhibition of selectin-mediated rolling might be advantageous, as it will probably avoid prolonged suppression of the host cellular defense system. Importantly, sulfation of trestatin A was required for anti-L-selectin and anti-P-selectin activity, further emphasizing the role of sulfate residues for L-selectin and P-selectin binding to carbohydrate ligands (Fig. 7).Three UFH and three LMWH had highly variable anti-P-selectin activity. UFH A, a preparation extracted from porcine intestinal mucosa, had no detectable anti-L-selectin and anti-P-selectin activity, whereas UFH C had a strong anti-P-selectin activity and UFH B a moderate inhibitory effect on P-selectin-mediated rolling. These observations indicate that the exhibition of an anti-selectin activity is not a general property of UFH, a notion consistent with the data available in the literature. In some studies, certain heparin preparations were found to have significant inhibitory activity against L-selectin or P-selectin; in other studies, selectin inhibition was absent and no reaction was observed with heparin or heparan sulfate proteoglycans (41Norgard-Sumnicht K.E. Varki N.M. Varki A. Science. 1993; 261: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 46Koenig A. Norgard-Sumnicht K. Linhardt R. Varki A. J. Clin.

Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1473-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). These differences suggest that certain heparin could express unique structural features that support L-selectin and P-selectin binding. Differences in molecular weight, degree of sulfation, as well as by the expression of specific binding sequences for L- or P-selectin may be important.Carboxyl reduction and sulfation of heparin or sulfation of non-uronic oligosaccharides such as trestatin A generates non-anticoagulant compounds with high anti-L-selectin and anti-P-selectin activities. These compounds have the potential of preventing leukocyte migration with reduced bleeding risk. The anti-inflammatory activity of CRS-heparin and trestatin A sulfate was evaluated in a thioglycollate-induced model of peritonitis. Subcutaneous injection of trestatin A sulfate and CRS, before thioglycollate intraperitoneal injection, inhibited neutrophil migration by 60–80%, confirming the potent inhibitory activity of these compounds on neutrophil adhesion and migration (Fig. 8). Neutrophil migration in this peritonitis model is dependent on E-selectin, P-selectin, and L-selectin function (74Tedder T.F. Steeber D.A. Pizcueta P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2259-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 75Mayadas T. Johnson R. Rayburn H. Hynes R. Wagner D.

Neutrophil migration was not completely inhibited despite blockade of L-selectin and P-selectin by CRS-heparin or trestatin A sulfate. Residual migration may result from E-selectin-dependent cell adhesion, a reaction not affected by CRS-heparin or trestatin A sulfate. Inhibition of cell migration could be enhanced by combining E-selectin inhibitors to CRS-heparin or trestatin A sulfate (77Bullard D.C. Kunkel E.J. Kubo H. Hicks M.J. Lorenzo I. Doyle N.A.

One of these complexes, xACF, consists of ISWI, Acf1, and a previously uncharacterized protein of 175 kDa. Like both ACF and CHRAC, this complex organizes randomly deposited histones into a regularly spaced array.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3681-3691Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and basic residues in CycT1 (Arg-251 and Arg-254) further stabilize the Tat·P-TEFb·TAR RNA complex (8Garber M.E. Wei P.

Thus the assembly of this complex appears to involve a series of adaptive interactions between the trans-activation and arginine-rich motif (RNA binding) domains of Tat and their respective protein (CycT1) and nucleic acid (TAR) partners during transcription. These studies have raised the possibility that at least two separate events may govern the assembly of functional P-TEFb·Tat·TAR complexes. 1) The interaction of Tat with CycT1 induces a conformational change in Tat that enhances its affinity and kinetic stability for TAR RNA. 2) TAR RNA may enhance the affinity between CycT1 and Tat, through an “induced fit” mechanism. These two events would not necessarily be mutually exclusive, and both could contribute significantly to the assembly of a stable ternary complex necessary to position P-TEFb at the RNA exit channel in a location favorable for phosphorylation of the RNAPII CTD. To test these hypotheses, we developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system containing TAR RNA and Tat protein uniquely labeled with donor and acceptor dye molecules (Fig. 1). FRET, in which a fluorescent donor molecule transfers energy via a non-radioactive dipole-dipole interaction to an acceptor molecule (which is usually also a fluorescent molecule) is a standard spectroscopic technique for measuring distances in the 10–70-Å range (15Clegg R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 353-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 16Yang M. Millar D.P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 417-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The lifetime and quantum yield of the donor are reduced upon energy transfer, and the acceptor fluorescence is increased or sensitized. Quantification of the efficiency of energy transfer allows determination of the distance between the two fluorophores. We used a well characterized donor-acceptor dye pair, fluorescein-rhodamine, for FRET experiments. Our results demonstrate that CycT1 enhances the affinity and kinetic stability of Tat·TAR complex formation. In addition, it was discovered that TAR RNA enhances CycT1 and Tat interaction showing how a small RNA hairpin can provide a platform for protein-protein interactions. RNAs were synthesized by chemical and enzymatic methods. Modified TAR RNA was synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer using 2-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite chemistry. All the monomers of (2-cyanoethyl) phosphoramidites were obtained from Glen Research (Sterling, VA). TAR RNA was chemically synthesized on a fluorescein-containing CPG 500 support. RNA (1 μmol) containing fluorescein was deprotected by treatment with NH3-saturated methanol (2 ml) at 25 °C for 17 h. Product was filtered and dried in Speedvac. To deprotect 2′-OH silyl groups, the red pellet was dissolved in 50% triethylamine trihydrofluoride in dimethyl sulfoxide (0.5 ml) and left at room temperature for 16 h. Deprotected RNA was precipitated by the addition of 2 ml of isopropyl alcohol. After deprotection, RNA was purified and characterized as described previously (17Shah K. Wu H. Rana T.M.

After incubation at 4 °C overnight, the labeled RNAs were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. 3′- and 5′-end-labeled RNAs were gel-purified on a denaturing gel, visualized by autoradiography, eluted out of the gels, and desalted on a reverse-phase cartridge. The sequence of RNAs was determined by base hydrolysis and nuclease digestion. Alkaline hydrolysis of RNAs was carried out in hydrolysis buffer for 8–12 min at 85 °C. RNAs were incubated with 0.1 unit of RNase from Bacillus cereus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per picomole of RNA for 4 min at 55 °C in 16 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0, 0.8 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml yeast tRNA (Life Technologies, Inc.). This enzyme yields U- and C-specific cleavage of RNA. Sequencing products were resolved on 20% denaturing gels and visualized by phosphorimager analysis. Tat protein (aa 1–72) was chemically synthesized using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) amino acids, and 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine was incorporated at Lys-19. Details of Tat-Rhodamine synthesis will be described elsewhere. 2N. Tamilarasu and T. M. Rana, unpublished data. Rhodamine-labeled Tat (aa 1–72) was purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and characterized by mass spectrometry. In vitro transcription assays and electrophoretic mobility shift experiments showed that the rhodamine labeling did not significantly alter the structure of Tat that can interfere with its function (data not shown). Human CycT1 (aa 1–303 and aa 1–254) was expressed as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein, purified, and characterized as described previously (7Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.-M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 8Garber M.E. Wei P. KewalRamani V.N. Mayall T.P. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. Littman D.R. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3512-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The fluorescence measurements were performed on PTI fluorescence spectrophotometer controlled by Felix software. The excitation wavelength was 490 nm and slits width was set 3.5 nm for both excitation and emission. TAR-fluorescein (200 μl) samples were excited at 490 nm, and the emission intensity was measured at 512 and 575 nm. Measurements were performed in a 200-μl cuvette to reduce the inner filter effect. The concentrations of TAR RNA-Fl, TAT-Rh and CycT1 (aa 1–303)/Zn2+ were 8.0, 16.5, and 8.0 nm, respectively. The final concentration of Zn2+ was 0.18 mm. The absorbance of dye-labeled samples were maintained below 0.002 to avoid the inner filter effects. All samples were corrected for the light source excitation effect and for the background intensity of buffer fluorescence as well as for dilution factors. All experiments were done at room temperature, and the following buffer conditions were maintained: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 25 °C, 20 mm KCl, and 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. For quantitative application of FRET, it is necessary to label RNA and protein stoichiometrically at unique sites while retaining the functional properties of biological molecules. Fluorescein-labeled TAR RNA (TAR RNA-Fl) and rhodamine labeled Tat (Tat-Rh) protein were chemically synthesized by solid-phase methods. TAR RNA was labeled with fluorescein at its 3′-end, and rhodamine was incorporated at Lys-19 in the Tat sequence. We chose Lys-19 in the activation domain of Tat because it is located in the CycT1-interacting region of Tat and can be replaced with other amino acids without affecting the function of Tat. We examined FRET between Tat and TAR in the absence and presence of cyclin T1. Emission scans were recorded from 500 to 650 nm during the excitation at 490 nm of TAR RNA-Fl, TAR RNA-Fl with Tat-Rh, and TAR RNA-Fl, Tat-Rh, and CycT1 (aa 1–303) with Zn2+(Fig. 2 A). TAR RNA-Fl has an emission maximum around 512 nm (black), whereas upon adding Tat-Rh (red), this peak is decreased and another peak at 575 nm is increased. This reduction in fluorescein emission and the corresponding increase in rhodamine emission were due to the resonance energy transfer from TAR RNA-Fl to Tat-Rh. However, the presence of CycT1 (aa 1–303) with Zn2+ (blue) results in a smaller decrease in the donor fluorescence emission at 512 nm and a smaller increase at 575 nm in the acceptor fluorescence emission as compared with TAR RNA-Fl and Tat-Rh. The decrease in the efficiency of energy transfer in the presence of CycT1 (aa 1–303) and Zn2+ shows that the distance between the two fluorophores has increased, indicating that CycT1 induces a conformational change in Tat structure in a cyclin T1·Tat·TAR ternary complex. Several control experiments further support these observations and demonstrate the specificity of CycT1-Tat-TAR interactions. First, CycT1 (aa 1–303) alone has no effect on the emission spectrum of TAR RNA-Fl (data not shown), an indication of no interaction between these two molecules. Second, in the presence of a truncated CycT1 (aa 1–254), which does not contain Tat-interacting sequences, no specific quenching was observed on either Tat protein or Tat·TAR complex (data not shown). Finally, fluorescence energy transfer was not observed when TAR RNA-Fl was incubated with either free rhodamine dye or unlabeled Tat protein. Wild-type unlabeled TAR RNA successfully competed with the labeled TAR RNA bound to Tat (data no shown), indicating that the fluorescence energy transfer between TAR RNA-Fl and TAT-Rh is due to their specific interactions. These results demonstrate that we have established a specific FRET-based system to study cyclin T1·Tat·TAR ribonucleoprotein complex. To determine the effect of cyclin T1 on the affinity of Tat for TAR RNA, we examined fluorescence quenching of TAR RNA-Fl at several different Tat-Rh concentrations in the absence and presence of CycT1 (aa 1–303). Results of these experiments are shown in Fig.2 B. K D values were calculated by fitting data to quadratic Equation 1,F=Fmin−{(Fmax−Fmin)[(R+P+K)−((R+P+K) 2−4RP) 1/2]}/2REquation 1 where F is the relative fluorescent intensity;F min is the fluorescent intensity at the start of the titration; F max is the fluorescent intensity at saturating concentration of protein, P. R is the total concentration of the RNA. K is the dissociation constant of the RNA and protein and can be obtained by fitting data to this equation. The dissociation constants (K D) of Tat(aa 1–72)·TAR complex in the presence and absence of CycT1-(1–303) were 0.8 ± 0.4 and 8.2 ± 0.8 nm, respectively. The 10-fold increase of the affinity between TAR RNA and Tat in the presence of CycT1 demonstrates that CycT1 has a significant effect on the formation of high affinity Tat·TAR complex. What is the affinity of CycT1-Tat interactions and does TAR RNA play any role in this interaction? To address this question, we measured rhodamine fluorescence quenching at 575 nm by titration of CycT1 (aa 1–303) with Tat-Rh. Fig. 3 Ashows the best fit of the data using Equation 1, and a dissociation constant of 9.1 nm for Tat and CycT1 (aa 1–303) complex was obtained. To determine the effect of TAR RNA on cyclin T1-Tat interactions, the same experiments were performed in the presence of equal molar of unlabeled TAR RNA to TAT-Rh (Fig. 3 B). The dissociation constant for CycT1 (aa 1–303) and Tat in the presence of TAR was 0.4 nm. These results show that TAR RNA greatly enhances protein-protein interactions between CycT1 and Tat. An important test of biological significance of ribonucleoprotein complexes is their kinetic stability, especially in the context of a vast excess of nonspecific RNA in the cell. The kinetic stability of the cyclin T1·Tat·TAR complex was determined by forming a complex between TAR RNA-Fl, Tat-Rh, and CycT1 (aa 1–303), challenging the complex with an excess of unlabeled competitor and measuring the amount of remaining complex at different time intervals. Unlabeled TAR RNA 40–100-fold excess over labeled TAR RNA-Fl was used for the competition. As shown in Fig. 2 A, TAR RNA-Fl fluorescence is quenched by Tat-Rh in a Tat·TAR complex; therefore, addition of unlabeled competitor would displace Tat-Rh from the complex and would result in an increase in fluorescence signal of TAR RNA-Fl at 512 nm. Therefore, the amount of remaining CycT1·Tat·TAR complex can be assayed by measuring the fluorescence intensity of TAR RNA-Fl at 512 nm. Fig. 4 A shows the fraction of the remaining CycT1·Tat·TAR complex as a function of time when 70-fold excess of unlabeled TAR RNA competitor was added. The dissociation rate constant (k off) can readily be obtained by fitting data using Equation 2.[complex] t/[complex] t=0=Aexp(−kofft)Equation 2 where [complex]t and [complex]t=0are the concentrations of the complex at time t andt = 0, respectively. A is the fitting parameter that represents the ratio of [complex]t/[complex]t=0 att = 0. k off is the dissociation rate constant. In order to test the relationship between k offand the concentration of competitor, 40–100-fold excess of unlabeled TAR RNA over labeled TAR RNA were used. The k offvalues for CycT1·Tat·TAR complex in the presence of 40-, 70-, and 100-fold competitor RNA were 0.021, 0.034, and 0.09 min−1, respectively. A linear increase of the dissociation rates of the complex with the increase of the total competitor concentration was observed (Fig. 4 B), which indicates that the dissociation of the complex is facilitated by competitor RNA (23Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). Similar experiments were performed on Tat-Rh and TAR RNA-Fl complex in the absence of CycT1 which showed that the complex dissociated with a k off of 0.2 min−1 in the presence of 40-fold competitor RNA (data not shown). The lifetime of Tat·TAR complex is 5 min, while under similar conditions CycT1·Tat·TAR complex has a lifetime of 48 min. Therefore, these data indicate that CycT1 enhances the kinetic stability of the Tat-TAR interactions by ∼10-fold. The result that CycT1 modulates kinetic stability of Tat-TAR interactions may have great biological implications because a functional ribonucleoprotein complex must be stable to an overwhelming excess of nonspecific RNA in the cell. To determine the conformational changes caused by CycT1 in Tat·TAR complex, we formed a complex between TAR RNA-Fl and Tat-Rh and calculated the distance between two fluorophores, rhodamine at Lys-19 of Tat and fluorescein at 3′-end of TAR RNA. The distance (R) between donor, TAR RNA-Fl, and acceptor, TAT-Rh, can be measured spectroscopically by Förster energy transfer (24Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983: 303-336Crossref Google Scholar). The distance R was determined from the following equation:r = R 0(E −1 − 1)1/6, whereE is the efficiency of nonradioactive transfer. Ewas calculated from the quenching of fluorescence emission maximum at 512 nm, i.e. E = (1 −I DA/I D), I DA, and I D are the fluorescence intensities at 512 nm in the presence and absence of acceptor, respectively.R 0 = 9786(k 2 n −4 Q d J)1/6 A. The donor quantum yieldQ d (0.26) was determined using disodium fluorescein in 0.1 m NaOH (25Weber G. Teale F.W.J. Trans. Faraday Soc. 1957; 53: 646-655Crossref Scopus (499) Google Scholar), where k represents the relative orientation of the two fluorophores. Considering a random orientation of donor and acceptor transition dipoles, k was assumed to be 2/3 (24Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983: 303-336Crossref Google Scholar). The refractive index of the medium,n, was taken as 1.4 for protein in water.J(4.46 × 10−13cm6/mol) is the overlap of the integral and was calculated from the overlap between the donor emission and acceptor absorbance.J can be calculated from the sum of the wavelength of equation J = Σ(εA(λ)F D(λ)λ4Δλ)/ΣF D(λ), where εA(λ) andF D(λ) are the extinction coefficient of acceptor and the intensity of fluorescence emission of donor, respectively. The fluorescence intensity of the TAR RNA-Fl in the presence of TAT-Rh was used to calculate the distance between the two fluorophores. The efficiency of energy transfer (E) is shown in Fig.5. The efficiency of transfer between TAR-Fl and TAT-Rh was 25% (Table I). However, in the presence of CycT1 (aa 1–303) and 0.18 mmZn2+, the efficiency of energy transfer was decreased to 15% (Table I). The distance (R) between two fluorophores was determined from R 0 and E that showed that Lys-19 rhodamine in Tat is 57.2 Å apart from fluorescein at the 3′-end of TAR RNA, and this distance was changed to 63.6 Å in the presence of CycT1-(1–303). Since Lys-19-rhodamine is located in the CycT1-interacting region of Tat, these results indicate that Tat goes through a structural reorganization upon CycT1 binding (Fig.5).Table IDistance between the fluorescein-labeled TAR RNA and rhodamine-labeled Tat in the presence and absence of cyclin T1DonorAcceptorQ dJ DAR 0ERCyclin T1cm 6 /molÅ%ÅTAR-FlTat-Rh0.264.46 × 10−1347.625 ± 357.2−TAR-FlTat-Rh0.264.46 × 10−1347.615 ± 363.6+ Open table in a new tab Interestingly, when Zn2+ was removed from the binding reactions, no energy transfer was detected. This result supports a previously proposed model for cyclin T1-Tat-TAR interactions suggesting that Tat forms a metal-linked heterodimer with cyclin T1 (8Garber M.E. Wei P. KewalRamani V.N. Mayall T.P. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. Littman D.R. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3512-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). We find that Tat (aa 1–72) binds TAR RNA with a K Dof 8.2 nm and that this affinity is enhanced 10-fold in the presence of CycT1 (aa 1–303). Taken together with the changes in the relative location of Tat on TAR when bound to CycT1, we infer that CycT1 enhances the affinity and stability of the Tat·TAR complex in a manner that is accompanied by a significant conformational change in the structure of the Tat protein. In addition, a Tat peptide containing only the arginine-rich motif, Tat (aa 49–57), binds TAR with aK D of 1 nm, whereas a longer peptide containing additional amino acids from the core domain, Tat(aa 38–72), has a lower affinity for TAR RNA with a K D of 5.7 nm. 3J. Zhang, N. Tamilarasu, S. Hwang, and T. M. Rana, unpublished observations. The observation that the isolated arginine-rich motif of Tat binds much more tightly to TAR RNA than Tat proteins containing the activation domain has also been observed with the native full-length (86 aa) HIV-1 and (130 aa) HIV-2 Tat proteins (9Garber M.E. Wei P. Jones K.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and suggests an autoinhibitory mechanism in which intramolecular interactions involving residues that overlap the activation domain effectively block binding to TAR RNA in the absence of CycT1. Interaction with CycT1 overcomes this inhibitory effect and permits high affinity binding of residues in the arginine-rich motif to TAR RNA. Although intramolecular masking is a well characterized feature of DNA-binding enhancer factors such as Ets-1 and p53 (26Jonsen M.D. Petersen J.M. Xu Q.-P. Graves B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 27Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5057-5064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to our knowledge it has not been reported previously in sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins. Autoinhibition could serve an important mechanism to ensure that Tat will not bind TAR RNA without first interacting with CycT1 in the P-TEFb complex, and free uncomplexed Tat protein may be unstable and subject to rapid turnover by cellular proteases, as has been suggested for other unstructured transcriptional regulators (reviewed in Ref. 29Frankel A.D. Smith C.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 149-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), thus providing the virus a mechanism to restrict the level of nonfunctional Tat in infected cells. Importantly, we also find that TAR RNA strongly enhances the interaction between Tat and CycT1. RNA-induced protein-protein interactions have been most clearly documented with the λ N protein, which binds to a site in the box B RNA to mediate transcriptional anti-termination (30Van Gilst M.R.

Recent models suggest that the N protein induces a restructuring of residues in the loop of the box B RNA hairpin loop to provide a platform for the subsequent loading of the λ NusA protein (31Su L.

Cell. 1998; 1: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction of N with box B RNA enhances the weak protein-protein interaction that is otherwise observed between N and NusA (reviewed in Ref. 29Frankel A.D. Smith C.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 149-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The regulation of protein interaction through structural alterations in the RNA could be an important mechanism for controlling the order of assembly of the Tat·P-TEFb·TAR complex both to ensure that Tat will not commit to TAR in the absence of CycT1(P-TEFb) and, similarly, to ensure that P-TEFb is preferentially utilized at the viral promoter, since cellular genes do not express TAR RNA. The ability to remodel a transcriptional activator through interaction with protein and nucleic acids partners could also be important for exchanging Tat protein with other possible partners. Thus, after phosphorylation of the RNAPII CTD, Tat has been shown to interact with RNA polymerase II rather than TAR (34Keen N.J. Churcher M.J. Karn J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5260-5272Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The mechanism that controls the disassembly of the stable Tat·P-TEFb·TAR complex is unknown but may rely on the ability of the Tat protein to model itself to available surfaces on the RNA polymerase elongation complex. These findings with the Tat and λ N proteins highlight the versatility of RNA as an enhancer of specific protein-protein interactions."

The latter activate downstream signaling pathways, including those of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The activation of two members of the MAPK family, ERK1 and ERK2, also called p44 and p42, respectively, occurs via phosphorylation by a cytoplasmic dual-specificity MAPK kinase, MEK1, and is often associated with the stimulation of cell proliferation (10Cano E.

A question raised by these results is whether, in the absence of its HS receptor, FGF-2 is able to stimulate all immediate-early signaling pathways or whether there are quantitative and qualitative differences in the early signals generated by FGF-2 in the absence and presence of its HS receptor. To address this question, we have used chlorate (35Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 36Greve H. Cully Z.

In control cells, FGF-2 induced a sustained phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK and p90RSK, and at least the former was associated with the subsequent stimulation of DNA synthesis. Interestingly, FGF-2 also stimulated the MEK1-dependent degradation of IκBα and IκBβ. In marked contrast, in chlorate-treated and hence sulfated glycosaminoglycan-deficient cells, FGF-2 could stimulate a transient early phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK and p90RSK. However, in chlorate-treated cells in the presence of HS or heparin, FGF-2 induced the sustained phosphorylation of p42/44MAPKand p90RSK and the degradation of IκBα and IκBβ and stimulated DNA synthesis. These results suggest that the HS receptor for FGF-2 not only influences the eventual outcome of FGF-2 signaling,e.g. cell proliferation, but importantly can regulate the immediate-early signals generated by the growth factor.DISCUSSIONTo stimulate cell proliferation, FGF-2 must interact with a dual receptor system consisting of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs) and a polysaccharide receptor, HS (3Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar, 4Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar). The original explanation for the dependence of the proliferative activity of FGF-2 on HS was that the HS was required for a high affinity interaction between FGF-2 and the FGFR. However, a body of evidence has accumulated that indicates that FGF-2 is able to interact with high affinity with the FGFR (K d ∼ 10−10m) in the absence of HS (31Fannon M. Nugent M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17949-17956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 32Nugent M.A. Edelman E.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Such interactions, although unable to induce cell proliferation, are able to activate the transcription of the immediate-early gene c-fos (33Roghani M. Mansukhani A. Dellera P. Bellosta P. Basilico C. Rifkin D.B. Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3976-3984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK (34Lundin L. Larsson H. Kreuger J.

However, the ability of FGF-2 to stimulate early signaling events in the absence of HS and whether the same pathways are stimulated in a similar fashion in the presence of HS are not well understood.The stimulation of Rama-27 fibroblast proliferation by FGF-2 was abolished when the cells are treated with chlorate (Fig. 3). Chlorate is a potent inhibitor of sulfation of glycosaminoglycans by virtue of its inhibition of the synthesis of PAPS, the activated sulfate donor (35Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chlorate itself did not affect the intrinsic ability of the cells to mount a growth stimulatory response. Thus, the addition of sulfate restored the stimulation of DNA synthesis by FGF-2. Moreover, epidermal growth factor, a growth factor that does not bind to HSPGs, stimulated DNA synthesis irrespective of the cells' treatment with chlorate. The addition of soluble heparin or purified HSPGs from Rama-27 cells restored the stimulation of DNA synthesis by FGF-2 (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that, in Rama-27 fibroblasts, the stimulation of cellular proliferation by FGF-2 requires both FGFR-1 (39Rahmoune H. Chen H.-L. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 931-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In chlorate-treated Rama-27 cells, FGF-2 stimulated the early peak of p42/44MAPK dual phosphorylation, but failed to maintain the subsequent sustained plateau of phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK (Fig. 2). As in control cells (Fig.1 C), the dual phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK was faithfully mirrored by the phosphorylation of p90RSK (Fig.5 B). This result agrees with those that show an early (7–10 min) stimulation of p42/44MAPK dual phosphorylation by FGF-2 in cells lacking sulfated HS (34Lundin L. Larsson H. Kreuger J. Kanda S. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24653-24660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 48Fannon M. Forsten K.E. Nugent M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1434-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, the early peaks of dual phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK and the consequent phosphorylation of p90RSK are not dependent on HS. In the presence of endogenous HSPGs, FGF-2 elicits an early peak of phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK and p90RSK, and the phosphorylation of these kinases is subsequently maintained at half-maximal levels. Moreover, we observed that PD098059 inhibits DNA synthesis and the phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK and p90RSK. Taken together, these results suggest that an important determinant of whether the p42/44MAPK signaling pathway permits cell proliferation is the sustained, long-term phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK, as in other systems (51LaVallee T.M. Prudovsky I.A. McMahon G.A. Hu X. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1647-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 52Sellers L.A. Feniuk W. Humphrey P.P. Lauder H. J. Biol.

J. 1993; 289: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Importantly, the failure of chlorate-treated Rama-27 cells to mount a growth stimulatory response to FGF-2 is associated with an absence of a sustained stimulation of the dual phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK, which is corrected by the addition of exogenous HSPGs or heparin. Thus, HS would appear to regulate the kinetics of phosphorylation of the MAPKs by FGF-2.In the absence of HS, the interaction between FGF-2 and the FGFR is of high affinity (31Fannon M. Nugent M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17949-17956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 32Nugent M.A. Edelman E.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 33Roghani M. Mansukhani A. Dellera P. Bellosta P. Basilico C. Rifkin D.B. Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3976-3984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which explains why FGF-2 is able to stimulate the transient dual phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK. One mechanism whereby HS could elicit its effects would be to reduce the deactivation of the ligand-bound FGFR and thus prolong the signaling capacity of the receptor-ligand complex. Two studies have suggested that the rate of dissociation of FGF-2 from the FGFR is considerably slower in the presence of HS (32Nugent M.A. Edelman E.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 54Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25803-25809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other evidence suggests that although the endocytic rates of FGF-2 are not markedly dependent on HS (31Fannon M. Nugent M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17949-17956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the intracellular routing and processing of receptor-bound FGF-2 do depend on HS (55Reiland J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Sperinde G.V. Nugent M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be established whether HS does indeed regulate the immediate-early signaling of FGF-2 by controlling the down-regulation of the FGFR and its intracellular routing or by some other means.The phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB proteins are an immediate-early signaling event following various stimuli (18Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar, 19Blackwell T.S. Christman J.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Although FGF-2 induced the rapid degradation of IκB proteins in various cell types (20Hoshi S. Goto M. Koyama N. Nomoto K. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 883-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Mohan R. Sivak J. Ashton P. Russo L.A. Pham B.Q. Kasahara N. Raizman M.B. Fini M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10405-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) including Rama-27 cells (Fig.2 A), this HS-binding growth factor was unable to elicit this phenomenon in chlorate-treated and hence sulfated glycosaminoglycan-deficient cells (Fig. 6). However, in chlorate-treated cells stimulated with FGF-2 together with heparin, the degradation of IκBα and IκBβ occurred with the same kinetics as those observed in control cells. These results clearly indicate that HS is essential for FGF-2 to stimulate IκB protein degradation. NF-κB proteins have been shown to be involved in the inhibition of apoptosis, the activation of cellular stress responses, and the stimulation of cellular proliferation (18Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar). IκB kinases have been recently proposed to be differentially activated by NF-κB inducers (26Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 30Schouten G.J. Vertegaal A.C. Whiteside S.T. Israel A. Toebes M. Dorsman J.C. van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3133-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Indeed, p90RSK has been shown to be essentially required for the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα in response to mitogens (30Schouten G.J. Vertegaal A.C. Whiteside S.T. Israel A. Toebes M. Dorsman J.C. van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3133-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In our system, PD098059 prevented the degradation of IκB proteins (Fig. 2 B) and abrogated p42/44MAPK phosphorylation and cell proliferation (Fig.1 A). The phosphorylation of IκB proteins following FGF-2 stimulation may thus occur through p42/44MAPK and p90RSK in Rama-27 fibroblasts. Furthermore, our results suggest that the sustained phosphorylation of these kinases, and thus their ability to effect the phosphorylation of IκB proteins, is dependent on the presence of HS in the receptor complexes at the cell surface. Therefore, cellular HSPGs are able to regulate at least some of the early FGF-2-induced intracellular signals that lead to cell proliferation. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2,1 basic FGF) possesses a dual receptor system consisting of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGF receptors (FGFRs)) (1Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar) and heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans (HSPGs) (2Fernig D.G. Gallagher J.T. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1994; 5: 353-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The interaction of FGF-2 with HS is required for the stimulation of cell proliferation (3Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar, 4Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M.

Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The interaction of FGF-2 with the FGFR is thought to induce receptor dimerization and activation of the FGFR tyrosine kinase (6Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R.

The latter activate downstream signaling pathways, including those of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The activation of two members of the MAPK family, ERK1 and ERK2, also called p44 and p42, respectively, occurs via phosphorylation by a cytoplasmic dual-specificity MAPK kinase, MEK1, and is often associated with the stimulation of cell proliferation (10Cano E.

The activated p42/44MAPK will, in turn, phosphorylate an array of cellular substrates, including downstream Ser/Thr effector kinases such as p90RSK (protein of 90 kDa from theribosomal subunit S6 kinase gene), also known as RSK1 (12Thomson S.

https://openalex.org/W2081855564,"Macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions accumulate excess free cholesterol (FC) and phospholipid. Because excess FC is toxic to macrophages, these observations may have relevance to macrophage death and necrosis in atheromata. Previous work by us showed that at early stages of FC loading, when macrophages are still healthy, there is activation of the phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthetic enzyme, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT), and accumulation of PC mass. We hypothesized that this is an adaptive response, albeit transient, that prevents the FC:PC ratio from reaching a toxic level. To test this hypothesis directly, we created mice with macrophage-targeted disruption of the major CT gene,CTα, using the Cre-lox system. Surprisingly, the number of peritoneal macrophages harvested from CTα-deficient mice and their overall health under normal culture conditions appeared normal. Moreover, CT activity and PC biosynthesis and in vitro CT activity were decreased by 70–90% but were not absent. As a likely explanation of this residual activity, we showed that CTβ2, a form of CT that arises from another gene, is induced in CTα-deficient macrophages. To test our hypothesis that increased PC biosynthesis is an adaptive response to FC loading, the viability of wild-type versus CTα-deficient macrophages under control and FC-loading conditions was compared. After 5 h of FC loading, death increased from 0.7% to only 2.0% in wild-type macrophages but from 0.9% to 29.5% in CTα-deficient macrophages. These data offer the first molecular genetic evidence that activation of CTα and induction of PC biosynthesis in FC-loaded macrophages is an adaptive response. Furthermore, the data reveal that CTβ2 in macrophages is induced in the absence of CTα and that a low level of residual CT activity, presumably due to CTβ2, is enough to keep the cells viable in the peritoneum in vivo and under normal culture conditions. Macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions accumulate excess free cholesterol (FC) and phospholipid. Because excess FC is toxic to macrophages, these observations may have relevance to macrophage death and necrosis in atheromata. Previous work by us showed that at early stages of FC loading, when macrophages are still healthy, there is activation of the phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthetic enzyme, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT), and accumulation of PC mass. We hypothesized that this is an adaptive response, albeit transient, that prevents the FC:PC ratio from reaching a toxic level. To test this hypothesis directly, we created mice with macrophage-targeted disruption of the major CT gene,CTα, using the Cre-lox system. Surprisingly, the number of peritoneal macrophages harvested from CTα-deficient mice and their overall health under normal culture conditions appeared normal. Moreover, CT activity and PC biosynthesis and in vitro CT activity were decreased by 70–90% but were not absent. As a likely explanation of this residual activity, we showed that CTβ2, a form of CT that arises from another gene, is induced in CTα-deficient macrophages.

Because advanced lesional macrophages are known to accumulate large amounts of free cholesterol (FC)1 (7Lundberg B.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5772-5778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 12Tabas I. Marathe S. Keesler G.A. Beatini N. Shiratori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), FC-induced death in macrophages in advance atherosclerotic lesions may be a critically important event in advanced lesional complications (13Papahadjopoulos D. J. Theor. Biol. 1974; 43: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Tabas I. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).In this context, our laboratory has studied cellular events that occur during FC loading of macrophages, and we discovered that the cells respond initially by an increase in PC biosynthesis and cellular PC mass, which also appears to occur in lesional macrophages in vivo (15Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Tabas I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this response is post-translational activation of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT; also known as CCT), which catalyzes the conversion of choline-phosphate to CDP-choline (15Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Shiratori Y. Houweling M. Zha X. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29894-29903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have hypothesized that activation of CT in response to FC loading in macrophages is an adaptive response (12Tabas I. Marathe S. Keesler G.A. Beatini N. Shiratori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cellular FC excess is known to be toxic to cells primarily by altering the physical properties of cellular membranes, leading to dysfunction of integral membrane proteins (18Yeagle P.L. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1991; 73: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that the induction of PC biosynthesis in FC-loaded cells would help keep the FC:phospholipid ratio in cellular membrane from reaching cytotoxic levels. Observations of macrophages after prolonged periods of FC loading, where cell death follows a decline in the PC biosynthetic response, provided evidence in support of this hypothesis, but direct molecular support has been lacking (12Tabas I. Marathe S. Keesler G.A. Beatini N. Shiratori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).To address this issue, we sought to create a mouse model whose macrophages had deficient CT activity and compromised PC biosynthetic capacity. Our hypothesis predicts that macrophages from such a mouse would be more susceptible to FC-induced cytotoxicity. Our strategy was to manipulate genetically CT in macrophages using the Cre-lox system (19Rajewsky K. Gu H. Kuhn R. Betz U.A. Muller W. Roes J. Schwenk F. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). By way of background, at least two genes in mammalian cells encode CT enzymes as follows: one that gives rise to CTα, which is ubiquitous and the most active form of CT, and another gene calledCTβ, which gives rise to an enzyme called CTβ2 and, at least in humans, to a truncated form arising by alternative splicing called CTβ1 (20Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). CTα is subject to regulation by both lipid binding and phosphorylation (22Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 1151-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 23Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Both forms of CTβ have catalytic and lipid-binding domains that are homologous to CTα, and CTβ2 also has a homologous phosphorylation domain (21Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), but little is known about the regulation or function of either isoform of CTβ.We now report the creation of a mouse in which the CTαgene has been disrupted in macrophages using the Cre-lox system. We show that peritoneal macrophages obtained from this mouse model have no detectable CTα protein and markedly decreased, although not absent, CT activity and PC biosynthesis. Interestingly, CTβ2 is induced in these macrophages, and this finding likely explains the residual CT activity in CTα-deficient macrophages, the normal number of peritoneal macrophages present in the mouse, and the ability of the CTα-deficient macrophages to remain healthy under normal culture conditions. Most importantly, CTα-deficient macrophages are markedly more sensitive to FC-induced death, thus providing important molecular genetic evidence in support of the hypothesis described above.DISCUSSIONA major impetus for the project described in this report was related to our previous finding that macrophages respond to FC loading by increasing CT activity, PC biosynthesis, and cellular PC mass (15Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several observations have led us to propose that these events represent an adaptive response to prevent, at least initially, the FC:phospholipid ratio from reaching cytotoxic levels (18Yeagle P.L. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1991; 73: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). For example, after prolonged FC loading of macrophages, CT activity and PC biosynthesis decline, and shortly thereafter the cells begin to die (18Yeagle P.L. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1991; 73: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The most direct test of this hypothesis, however, required studying macrophages with defective PC biosynthesis via molecular genetic manipulation of CT. The data in this report clearly demonstrate that such macrophages are markedly more susceptible to FC-induced death, thus providing strong support to the hypothesis. We propose that in FC-loaded wild-type macrophages, the excess PC, which accumulates mostly in intracellular whorl-like membrane structures (15Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), acts as a sink for the excess FC and thus prevents accumulation of FC in cellular membranes. Based on the data of Yeagle (18Yeagle P.L. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1991; 73: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and others (14Tabas I. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), this process would be expected to promote cell survival by protecting enzymes and transport proteins in the plasma membrane and other membranes from an abnormally rigid lipid environment. The eventual failure of this adaptive response even in wild-type macrophages (above) may be due to direct inactivation of CT itself by an overwhelming load of FC. Moreover, this process may be accelerated by apoptosis-induced inhibition of choline phosphotransferase (37Anthony M.L. Zhao M. Brindle K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19686-19692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In FC-loaded CTα-deficient macrophages, the failure of adaptation is accelerated by the low level of PC biosynthetic activity in these cells.The unique model described in this report has allowed us to address another important issue related to macrophage PC metabolism, namely the overall response of macrophages to CTα deficiency. Our data suggest that an increased level of expression of CTβ2 in CTα-deficient macrophages provides sufficient CT activity and PC biosynthesis to allow the cells to survive under normal conditions both in vivo, as evidenced by the overall health of the mice and the normal number of peritoneal macrophages, and in cell culture (Fig.5 C). The unmasking of a phenotype in these macrophages under FC-loading conditions, however, suggests that other “stressors” might also uncover interesting deficiencies in these cells. For example, macrophage proliferation (38Esko J.D. Raetz C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), an event known to occur in atherosclerotic lesions (39Rosenfeld M.E. Ross R. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 680-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Rekhter M.D. Gordon D. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 668-677PubMed Google Scholar, 41Gordon D. Reidy M.A. Benditt E.P. Schwartz S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4600-4604Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), as well as other cellular events associated with membrane remodeling, such as phagocytosis and exocytosis (42Cohn Z.A. Fed. Proc. 1975; 34: 1725-1729PubMed Google Scholar, 43Cox D. Lee D.J. Dale B.M. Calafat J. Greenberg S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), might be deficient in CTα-deficient macrophages.The functions of CTβ are still under investigation. In our study with murine macrophages, we were only able to detect the presence of CTβ2, which could be due to either suboptimal reagents for murine tissue (i.e. antibodies and PCR primers based on human or rat CTβ) or to the possibility that mice have no or very low levels of CTβ1.3 CTβ2 lacks the N-terminal nuclear localization domain present in CTα but has regions homologous to the catalytic, membrane-binding, and C-terminal phosphorylation domains of CTα (21Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Most importantly, CTβ demonstrates catalytic activity, although its specific activity appears to be less than that of CTα when expressed in COS-7 cells (20Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This latter point may account for our finding that PC biosynthesis was still markedly decreased in CTα-deficient macrophages even in the face of induced expression of CTβ2. Another interesting result from our studies was that [3H]choline incorporation into [3H]PC was increased by FC loading in CTα-deficient macrophages (Fig. 4 C). Pending further work in this area, we hypothesize that CTβ2, like CTα (15Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Shiratori Y. Houweling M. Zha X. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29894-29903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), can be activated by FC loading. In this context, we previously found that FC-induced CT activation in wild-type macrophages was associated with dephosphorylation of CTα (17Shiratori Y. Houweling M. Zha X. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29894-29903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and so the presence of a phosphorylation domain in CTβ2 may be important in the increase in [3H]PC biosynthesis in FC-loaded CTα-deficient macrophages.The current study has focused on cultured peritoneal macrophages obtained from the unique model described herein. However, in future studies we plan to address the role in vivo of PC biosynthesis in the function of macrophages as well as neutrophils, which are also targeted by LysMCre (26Clausen B.E. Burkhardt C. Reith W. Renkawitz R. Forster I. Transgenic Res. 1999; 8: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). To carry out these studies, it will first be necessary to remove the “floxed” Neo cassette from CTαflox gene in our mice (44Hamilton D.L. Abremski K. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 178: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).2 Once this has been accomplished, we will be able to test specific hypotheses in vivo using the LysMCre system. For example, we and others (13Papahadjopoulos D. J. Theor. Biol. 1974; 43: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Tabas I. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,45Fazio S. Liu L. Major A.S. Gleaves L.A. Accad M. Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Circulation. 1999; 100: I-613Google Scholar) have proposed that FC-induced macrophage death is an important cause of necrosis in advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Based on this proposal and the cell culture data reported here, we would predict that lesional necrosis would be increased in CTαflox/LysMCre mice with an atherosclerotic background (e.g. after crossing into the apolipoprotein E knockout background). Because lesional necrosis is a likely contributor to acute vascular events (46Newby A.C. Libby P. van der Wal A.C. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 41: 321-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), such a finding might have important implications related to the clinical complications of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Similarly, CTαflox/LysMCre mice can be used to study other PC-dependent functions of macrophages in vivo(e.g. in host defense), and the CTαflox mice can be crossed with mice expressing Cre in other tissues to address specific questions related to CTα, CTβ, and PC biosynthesis in these tissues. Cholesterol-loaded macrophages, or foam cells, play critical roles in atherogenesis, including the conversion of relatively benign early lesions into advanced lesions that lead to acute vascular occlusion (1Ross R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar,2Libby P. Clinton S.K. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 355-363Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). An important event related to macrophage foam cells in advanced atherosclerosis is the death of these cells (3Mitchinson M.J. Hardwick S.J. Bennett M.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 4Ball R.Y. Stowers E.C. Burton J.H. Cary N.R. Skepper J.N. Mitchinson M.J.

Because advanced lesional macrophages are known to accumulate large amounts of free cholesterol (FC)1 (7Lundberg B.

J. Theor. Biol. 1974; 43: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Tabas I. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this context, our laboratory has studied cellular events that occur during FC loading of macrophages, and we discovered that the cells respond initially by an increase in PC biosynthesis and cellular PC mass, which also appears to occur in lesional macrophages in vivo (15Shiratori Y.

The mechanism of this response is post-translational activation of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT; also known as CCT), which catalyzes the conversion of choline-phosphate to CDP-choline (15Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Shiratori Y. Houweling M. Zha X. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29894-29903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have hypothesized that activation of CT in response to FC loading in macrophages is an adaptive response (12Tabas I. Marathe S. Keesler G.A. Beatini N. Shiratori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cellular FC excess is known to be toxic to cells primarily by altering the physical properties of cellular membranes, leading to dysfunction of integral membrane proteins (18Yeagle P.L. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1991; 73: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that the induction of PC biosynthesis in FC-loaded cells would help keep the FC:phospholipid ratio in cellular membrane from reaching cytotoxic levels. Observations of macrophages after prolonged periods of FC loading, where cell death follows a decline in the PC biosynthetic response, provided evidence in support of this hypothesis, but direct molecular support has been lacking (12Tabas I. Marathe S. Keesler G.A. Beatini N. Shiratori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To address this issue, we sought to create a mouse model whose macrophages had deficient CT activity and compromised PC biosynthetic capacity. Our hypothesis predicts that macrophages from such a mouse would be more susceptible to FC-induced cytotoxicity. Our strategy was to manipulate genetically CT in macrophages using the Cre-lox system (19Rajewsky K. Gu H. Kuhn R. Betz U.A. Muller W. Roes J. Schwenk F. J. Clin.

By way of background, at least two genes in mammalian cells encode CT enzymes as follows: one that gives rise to CTα, which is ubiquitous and the most active form of CT, and another gene calledCTβ, which gives rise to an enzyme called CTβ2 and, at least in humans, to a truncated form arising by alternative splicing called CTβ1 (20Lykidis A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). CTα is subject to regulation by both lipid binding and phosphorylation (22Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 1151-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 23Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Both forms of CTβ have catalytic and lipid-binding domains that are homologous to CTα, and CTβ2 also has a homologous phosphorylation domain (21Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), but little is known about the regulation or function of either isoform of CTβ. We now report the creation of a mouse in which the CTαgene has been disrupted in macrophages using the Cre-lox system. We show that peritoneal macrophages obtained from this mouse model have no detectable CTα protein and markedly decreased, although not absent, CT activity and PC biosynthesis. Interestingly, CTβ2 is induced in these macrophages, and this finding likely explains the residual CT activity in CTα-deficient macrophages, the normal number of peritoneal macrophages present in the mouse, and the ability of the CTα-deficient macrophages to remain healthy under normal culture conditions. Most importantly, CTα-deficient macrophages are markedly more sensitive to FC-induced death, thus providing important molecular genetic evidence in support of the hypothesis described above. DISCUSSIONA major impetus for the project described in this report was related to our previous finding that macrophages respond to FC loading by increasing CT activity, PC biosynthesis, and cellular PC mass (15Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several observations have led us to propose that these events represent an adaptive response to prevent, at least initially, the FC:phospholipid ratio from reaching cytotoxic levels (18Yeagle P.L. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1991; 73: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). For example, after prolonged FC loading of macrophages, CT activity and PC biosynthesis decline, and shortly thereafter the cells begin to die (18Yeagle P.L. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1991; 73: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The most direct test of this hypothesis, however, required studying macrophages with defective PC biosynthesis via molecular genetic manipulation of CT. The data in this report clearly demonstrate that such macrophages are markedly more susceptible to FC-induced death, thus providing strong support to the hypothesis. We propose that in FC-loaded wild-type macrophages, the excess PC, which accumulates mostly in intracellular whorl-like membrane structures (15Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), acts as a sink for the excess FC and thus prevents accumulation of FC in cellular membranes. Based on the data of Yeagle (18Yeagle P.L. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1991; 73: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and others (14Tabas I. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), this process would be expected to promote cell survival by protecting enzymes and transport proteins in the plasma membrane and other membranes from an abnormally rigid lipid environment. The eventual failure of this adaptive response even in wild-type macrophages (above) may be due to direct inactivation of CT itself by an overwhelming load of FC. Moreover, this process may be accelerated by apoptosis-induced inhibition of choline phosphotransferase (37Anthony M.L. Zhao M. Brindle K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19686-19692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In FC-loaded CTα-deficient macrophages, the failure of adaptation is accelerated by the low level of PC biosynthetic activity in these cells.The unique model described in this report has allowed us to address another important issue related to macrophage PC metabolism, namely the overall response of macrophages to CTα deficiency. Our data suggest that an increased level of expression of CTβ2 in CTα-deficient macrophages provides sufficient CT activity and PC biosynthesis to allow the cells to survive under normal conditions both in vivo, as evidenced by the overall health of the mice and the normal number of peritoneal macrophages, and in cell culture (Fig.5 C). The unmasking of a phenotype in these macrophages under FC-loading conditions, however, suggests that other “stressors” might also uncover interesting deficiencies in these cells. For example, macrophage proliferation (38Esko J.D. Raetz C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), an event known to occur in atherosclerotic lesions (39Rosenfeld M.E. Ross R. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 680-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Rekhter M.D. Gordon D. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 668-677PubMed Google Scholar, 41Gordon D. Reidy M.A. Benditt E.P. Schwartz S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proc. 1975; 34: 1725-1729PubMed Google Scholar, 43Cox D. Lee D.J. Dale B.M. Calafat J. Greenberg S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), might be deficient in CTα-deficient macrophages.The functions of CTβ are still under investigation. In our study with murine macrophages, we were only able to detect the presence of CTβ2, which could be due to either suboptimal reagents for murine tissue (i.e. antibodies and PCR primers based on human or rat CTβ) or to the possibility that mice have no or very low levels of CTβ1.3 CTβ2 lacks the N-terminal nuclear localization domain present in CTα but has regions homologous to the catalytic, membrane-binding, and C-terminal phosphorylation domains of CTα (21Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Most importantly, CTβ demonstrates catalytic activity, although its specific activity appears to be less than that of CTα when expressed in COS-7 cells (20Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This latter point may account for our finding that PC biosynthesis was still markedly decreased in CTα-deficient macrophages even in the face of induced expression of CTβ2. Another interesting result from our studies was that [3H]choline incorporation into [3H]PC was increased by FC loading in CTα-deficient macrophages (Fig. 4 C). Pending further work in this area, we hypothesize that CTβ2, like CTα (15Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Shiratori Y. Houweling M. Zha X. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29894-29903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), can be activated by FC loading. In this context, we previously found that FC-induced CT activation in wild-type macrophages was associated with dephosphorylation of CTα (17Shiratori Y. Houweling M. Zha X. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29894-29903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and so the presence of a phosphorylation domain in CTβ2 may be important in the increase in [3H]PC biosynthesis in FC-loaded CTα-deficient macrophages.The current study has focused on cultured peritoneal macrophages obtained from the unique model described herein. However, in future studies we plan to address the role in vivo of PC biosynthesis in the function of macrophages as well as neutrophils, which are also targeted by LysMCre (26Clausen B.E. Burkhardt C. Reith W. Renkawitz R. Forster I. Transgenic Res. 1999; 8: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). To carry out these studies, it will first be necessary to remove the “floxed” Neo cassette from CTαflox gene in our mice (44Hamilton D.L. Abremski K. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 178: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).2 Once this has been accomplished, we will be able to test specific hypotheses in vivo using the LysMCre system. For example, we and others (13Papahadjopoulos D. J. Theor. Biol. 1974; 43: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Tabas I. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,45Fazio S. Liu L. Major A.S. Gleaves L.A. Accad M. Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Circulation. 1999; 100: I-613Google Scholar) have proposed that FC-induced macrophage death is an important cause of necrosis in advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Based on this proposal and the cell culture data reported here, we would predict that lesional necrosis would be increased in CTαflox/LysMCre mice with an atherosclerotic background (e.g. after crossing into the apolipoprotein E knockout background). Because lesional necrosis is a likely contributor to acute vascular events (46Newby A.C. Libby P. van der Wal A.C. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 41: 321-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), such a finding might have important implications related to the clinical complications of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Similarly, CTαflox/LysMCre mice can be used to study other PC-dependent functions of macrophages in vivo(e.g. in host defense), and the CTαflox mice can be crossed with mice expressing Cre in other tissues to address specific questions related to CTα, CTβ, and PC biosynthesis in these tissues. A major impetus for the project described in this report was related to our previous finding that macrophages respond to FC loading by increasing CT activity, PC biosynthesis, and cellular PC mass (15Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several observations have led us to propose that these events represent an adaptive response to prevent, at least initially, the FC:phospholipid ratio from reaching cytotoxic levels (18Yeagle P.L. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1991; 73: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). For example, after prolonged FC loading of macrophages, CT activity and PC biosynthesis decline, and shortly thereafter the cells begin to die (18Yeagle P.L. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1991; 73: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The most direct test of this hypothesis, however, required studying macrophages with defective PC biosynthesis via molecular genetic manipulation of CT. The data in this report clearly demonstrate that such macrophages are markedly more susceptible to FC-induced death, thus providing strong support to the hypothesis. We propose that in FC-loaded wild-type macrophages, the excess PC, which accumulates mostly in intracellular whorl-like membrane structures (15Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), acts as a sink for the excess FC and thus prevents accumulation of FC in cellular membranes. Based on the data of Yeagle (18Yeagle P.L. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1991; 73: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and others (14Tabas I. Trends Cardiovasc.

https://openalex.org/W1995047863,"Abstract BRCA1, a breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene, encodes a 220-kDa protein whose precise biochemical function remains unclear. BRCA1 contains an N-terminal RING finger that mediates protein-protein interaction. The C-terminal domain of BRCA1 (BRCT) can activate transcription and interacts with RNA polymerase holoenzyme. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified an interaction between the BRCA1 RING finger and ATF1, a member of the cAMP response element-binding protein/activating transcription factor (CREB/ATF) family. We demonstrate that BRCA1 and ATF1 can physically associate in vitro, in yeast, and in human cells. BRCA1 stimulated transcription from a cAMP response element reporter gene in transient transfections. BRCA1 also stimulated transcription from a natural promoter, that of tumor necrosis factor-α, in a manner dependent on the integrity of the cAMP response element. These results implicate BRCA1 in transcriptional activation of ATF1 target genes, some of which are involved in the transcriptional response to DNA damage."

In the Axin complex, GSK-3β efficiently phosphorylates β-catenin, which is then ubiquitinated and degraded by proteasome. We isolated a novel protein that binds to Axin and named it Axam (for Axinassociating molecule). Axam formed a complex with Axin in intact cells and bound directly to Axin. Axam inhibited the complex formation of Dvl with Axin and the activity of Dvl to suppress GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of Axin. Furthermore, Axam induced the degradation of β-catenin in SW480 cells and inhibited Wnt-dependent axis duplication inXenopus embryos.

At the cellular level, Wnt regulates proliferation, morphology, motility, and fate. The outlines of the Wnt signal transduction pathway were first elucidated by a genetic analysis of Wingless pathway during the development of segmental polarity inDrosophila and extended through studies of embryonic axis formation in Xenopus. A number of components of the Wingless pathway have been identified (3Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar, 4Dale T.C. Biochem.

In the current model, the serine/threonine kinase Zw3/shaggy targets cytoplasmic Armadillo protein for degradation in the absence of Wingless. As a result, cytoplasmic Armadillo levels are low. When Wingless interacts with its cell-surface receptor, D-Frizzled2, the signal antagonizes the action of Zw3 through Dishevelled. Armadillo is no longer degraded, resulting in its accumulation in both cytoplasm and nucleus, where it binds to Pangolin, a transcription factor, and stimulates gene expression. The intracellular components of the Wingless pathway are shared by multicellular animals. In Xenopus and mammals, the Frizzled homolog frizzled, the Dishevelled homolog Dvl, the Zw3 homolog GSK-3β,1 the Armadillo homolog β-catenin, and the Pangolin homolog T cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer binding factor family are involved in the transduction of the vertebrate Wnt signaling. Thus, the mechanism of the Wnt signaling pathway has been proposed based on Drosophila genetic evidence, but the biochemical relationship between the components in the pathway has not long been clarified. Discovery and functional analyses of Axin have provided new clues to understand how the Wnt signaling pathway is regulated (6Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry III, W.L. Lee J.J.

Expression of Axin in Xenopus embryos causes strong axis defects, and co-expression of Axin inhibits the Wnt-dependent axis duplication (6Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J.

Thus, Axin is a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway and inhibits axis formation. We have identified rat Axin (rAxin) and its homolog, Axil (for Axin like), as GSK-3β-interacting proteins (7Kikuchi A. Cell.

Commun. 1999; 266: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, the phosphorylation of β-catenin, APC, and Axin leads to the degradation of β-catenin. Dvl interacts with Axin (25Fagotto F. Jho E. Zeng L. Kurth T. Joos T. Kaufmann C. Costantini F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 26Kishida S. Yamamoto H.

It has been shown that Dvl displaces GSK-3 from its complex with Axin-related protein in Xenopus(28Itoh K. Antipova A. Ratcliffe M.J. Sokol S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 2228-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Wnt-3a-dependent accumulation of β-catenin and down-regulation of Axin are suppressed by expression of a dominant negative form of Dvl-1 (22Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Kishida M. Ikeda S. Takada S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10681-10684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the signal of Wnt to Axin is transmitted through Dvl. PP2A and PP2C bind to Axin and Dvl, respectively (17Ikeda S. Kishida M. Matsuura Y. Usui H. Kikuchi A.

Thus, Axin may be a scaffold protein, in that it binds to several signaling molecules to create a multiprotein complex. To find additional roles of Axin in the Wnt signaling pathway, we tried to identify a new protein that binds to Axin. We show here a novel Axin-binding protein that we designated Axam (for Axinassociating molecule). Axam binds directly to Axin and competes with Dvl for its binding to Axin, thereby inhibiting the activity of Dvl-1 to suppress the phosphorylation of Axin by GSK-3β. Furthermore, Axam degrades β-catenin in SW480 cells, human colon cancer cells, and inhibits axis formation in Xenopusembryos. These results suggest that Axam regulates the Wnt signaling pathway negatively by inhibiting the binding of Dvl to Axin. The cDNAs of human Dvl-1 andXenopus β-catenin (Xβ-catenin) were provided by B. Dallapiccola and G. Novelli (Vergata University, Rome, Italy) and D. Kimelman (University of Washington, Seattle), respectively. Recombinant baculovirus expressing GST-Dvl-1 (full length) was provided by Y. Matsuura (National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan). The anti-GST and anti-MBP antibodies were supplied by M. Nakata (Sumitomo Electronics, Yokohama, Japan). MBP and GST fusion proteins except for GST-Dvl-1 (full length) were purified from Escherichia coliaccording to the manufacturer's instructions. GST-Dvl-1 was purified from Spodptera frugiperda Sf9 cells. The anti-Myc antibody was prepared from 9E10 cells. The anti-GSK-3β, anti-β-catenin, anti-PP2A antibodies, and the anti-GFP antibody were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR), respectively. [α-32P]dCTP was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and TransFastTM (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) were used for transfection of COS and SW480 cells, respectively. Other materials were from commercial sources. pBTM116HA/rAxin, pMAL-c2/rAxin, pMAL-c2/rAxin-(298–506), pBJ-Myc/rAxin, pEF-BOS-Myc/rAxin-(1–713), pEF-BOS/Myc-rAxin-(298–506), pBJ-Myc/rAxin-(713–832), pBSKS/rAxin-(508–832), pCGN/Dvl-1, pSP64T/Xwnt-8, and pSP64T/Xglobin were constructed as described (10Ikeda S.

Standard recombinant DNA techniques were used to construct the following plasmids: pBSKS/Axam-(72–588), pGEX-4T/Axam-(72–588), pEGFP-C2/Axam-(72–588), pBSKS/Axam-(1–113), pGEX-2T/Axam-(1–113), pBSKS/Axam, pGEX-2T/Axam, pEGFP-C1/Axam, pBJ-Myc/rAxin-(1–437), pBSKS/rAxin-(713–832), pMALc-2/rAxin-(713–832), pMAL-c2/rAxin-(508–620), pMAL-c2/rAxin-(620–712), pGEX-2T/rAxin-(1–229), pMAL-c2/rAxin-(1–229), pMAL-c2/rAxin-(508–832), pEGFP-C2/Axam-(72–400), pEGFP-C3/Axam-(381–521), and pEGFP-C3/Axam-(521–588). In these plasmids, some plasmid constructions were done by digesting the original plasmids with restriction enzymes and inserting the fragments into the vectors. The other constructions were done by inserting the fragments generated by Expand™ High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) into the vectors. The entire polymerase chain reaction products were sequenced, and the structures of all plasmids were confirmed by restriction analysis. The anti-Axam rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with Axam-(72–588). Seven-week-old male rats of the Wistar strain were sedated with CO2 gas and sacrificed by decapitation. Cerebrum and cerebellum were immediately excised and homogenized in 9 ml/g of tissue (wet weight) of homogenizing buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, and 1 mm PMSF). 293, COS, L, F9, PC12, SW480, DLD-1, and RCN-9 cells (10-cm diameter dish) were lysed in 500 μl of the lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF) and the homogenate was centrifuged at 15, 000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. These extracts of rat tissues (100 μg/lane) and various cell lines (60 μg/lane) were probed with the anti-Axam antibody. To determine whether Axam interacts with Axin in intact cells, COS cells (6-cm-diameter dish) transfected with pEGFP, pCGN-, pEF-BOS, and/or pBJ-derived plasmids were lysed in 200 μl of the lysis buffer. The supernatant (150 μg of protein) was immunoprecipitated with the anti-GFP or anti-Myc antibody and then the immunoprecipitates were probed with the anti-GFP, anti-Myc, anti-HA, anti-PP2A, anti-GSK-3β, and/or anti-β-catenin antibodies. SW480 cells expressing Myc-rAxin, GFP, GFP-Axam, or GFP-Axam-(72–588) grown on coverslips were fixed for 20 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were washed with PBS three times and then permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2 mg/ml BSA for 2 h. They were washed and incubated for 1 h with the anti-Myc or β-catenin and GFP antibodies. After being washed with PBS, the cells were further incubated for 1 h with Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa-594-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. The coverslips were washed with PBS, mounted on glass slides, and viewed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (TCS-NT®, Leica-laser-technik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). For multichannel imaging, each fluorescence was imaged sequentially to eliminate cross-talk between the channels. To examine the interaction of Axam with Axin using the purified proteins in vitro, 1 μm GST-Axam and its deletion mutants were incubated with MBP-rAxin or its deletion mutants (40 pmol) immobilized on amylose resin in 40 μl of reaction mixture (20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 1 h at 4 °C. MBP-rAxin was precipitated by centrifugation, then the precipitates were probed with the anti-GST antibody. To observe the phosphorylation states of Axin in intact cells, COS cells expressing Myc-rAxin were treated with or without 100 nm okadaic acid for 12 h. The lysates were applied to a 6% SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to Western blot analysis with the anti-Myc antibody. When necessary, Myc-rAxin was immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were incubated with 6 units of alkaline phosphatase in 20 μl of reaction mixture (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA) for 30 min at 37 °C. After the incubation, the mixtures were probed with the anti-Myc antibody. SW480 cells (3.5-cm diameter dish) transfected with pEGFP-C2 or pEGFP-C2/Axam-(72–588) were washed with ice-cold PBS and suspended in 250 μl of the sonication buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF). This suspension was sonicated and centrifuged at 100, 000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. Aliquots (20 μl) of the supernatant were subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed with the anti-β-catenin, anti-GSK-3β, and anti-GFP antibodies. Myc-taggedAxam,Axam-(72–588), and Dvl-1cDNAs were subcloned into the pSP64T (31Kreig P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). HA-tagged mouseβ-catenin SA cDNA, in which serine/threonine residues at the positions of 33, 37, 41, and 45 were changed to alanine, was subcloned into pSP64T. Sense mRNA was obtained by in vitro transcription of linearized templates using SP6-mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion, Texas). Fertilized eggs were dejellied using 4.5% cysteine and mRNAs were injected into the equatorial region of dorsal or ventral blastomeres at the four-cell stage. After injection, embryos were cultured for 3 days and scored with the DAI (32Kao K.R. Elinson R.P. Dev. Biol. 1988; 127: 64-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid screening was carried out as described (10Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar, 11Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Uochi T. Ikeda S. Koyama S. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2867-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To obtain a full-length cDNA of Axam, the clone isolated by the yeast two-hybrid method was labeled with random primers and [α-32P]dCTP and used to screen a λZAP rat brain cDNA library. Northern blot analysis was performed as described (33Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with BSA as a standard (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217546) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that physically interact with Axin, we conducted a rat brain cDNA library screening by the yeast two-hybrid method. From 1 × 106 initial transformants, 2 clones were found to confer both the His+ and LacZ+ phenotypes on L40 expressing rAxin. Of these, a 1.6-kb cDNA insert was found to encode a sequence containing a long open reading frame and the consensus sequence for a stop codon. A full-length cDNA of this Axin-interacting protein was isolated from a rat brain cDNA library. This clone spanned a distance of 3.9 kb and contained an uninterrupted open reading frame of 1,764 base pairs, encoding a predicted protein of 588 amino acids with a calculatedM r of 67,251 (Fig.1 A). The first ATG was preceded by stop codons in all three reading frames, and the 5′-noncoding region had a high percentage of GC base pairs (74%). The neighboring sequence of the first ATG was consistent with the translation initiation start proposed by Kozak (35Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). By searching several data bases, we found one human cDNA (AB037752) registered in GenBankTM and two mouse ESTs (BE289601 and BE310212) as highly conserved homologs of this Axin-interacting protein. As the amino acid sequence predicted from the human cDNA clone shares 88% amino acid identity with two-thirds of the C-terminal region of the rat Axin-binding protein, it may be a human counterpart. However, we did not find similar sequences in EST clones from Xenopus,Drosophila, or Caenorhabditis elegans. Since this Axin-interacting protein is a novel protein, we named it Axam. The region of amino acid 31–49 of Axam contains a PEST sequence. A single band of 3.9-kb Axam mRNA was ubiquitously detected in rat tissues as far as we examined, and it was highly expressed in cerebrum, lung, and testis (Fig. 1 B). The anti-Axam antibody detected a protein with a molecular mass of 67 kDa in rat cerebrum and cerebellum. This protein was not observed when the antibody preincubated with MBP-Axam-(72–588) was used (data not shown). Its molecular mass is the same as that predicted from the amino acid sequence of Axam, suggesting that it is endogenous Axam. Furthermore, Axam was found in several cell lines including 293 (human kidney epithelial cell), COS (monkey kidney cell), L (mouse fibroblast), F9 (mouse teratocarcinoma cell), PC12 (rat pheochromocytoma cell), SW480 (human colon cancer cell), DLD-1 (human colon cancer cell), and RCN-9 (rat colon cancer cell) cells (Fig. 1 C). Various mutants of Axin and Axam used in this study are shown in Fig. 1 D. To examine whether Axam forms a complex with Axin in intact cells, rAxin was co-expressed with Axam or its deletion mutants in COS cells (Fig.2 A, lanes 1–12). rAxin and Axam were tagged with Myc and GFP epitopes at their N termini, respectively. When the lysates co-expressing Myc-rAxin with GFP-Axam were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody, GFP-Axam was detected in the Myc-rAxin immune complex (Fig. 2 A,lane 19). Similarly, when the same lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-GFP antibody, Myc-rAxin was detected in the GFP-Axam immune complex (data not shown). Neither Myc-rAxin nor GFP-Axam was immunoprecipitated from the lysates expressing both proteins with non-immune immunoglobulin (data not shown). Axam-(72–588) is an original protein isolated as a binding partner of rAxin by yeast two-hybrid screening. GFP-Axam-(72–588) but not GFP-Axam-(1–113) was immunoprecipitated with Myc-rAxin (Fig. 2 A, lanes 20 and 21). In residues 72–588, GFP-Axam-(72–400) but not GFP-Axam-(381–521) or GFP-Axam-(521–588) formed a complex with Myc-rAxin (Fig. 2 A, lanes 22–24). To determine which region of rAxin forms a complex with Axam in intact cells, various deletion mutants of rAxin were expressed with Axam in COS cells (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–5). When the lysates expressing Myc-rAxin mutants were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody, GFP-Axam was co-precipitated with Myc-rAxin (full length) and Myc-rAxin-(1–713) but not with Myc-rAxin-(1–437), Myc-rAxin-(298–506), or Myc-rAxin-(713–832) (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6–10). These results suggest that Axam interacts with Axin in intact cells and that the region containing residues 114–380 of Axam and the region containing residues 507–712 of rAxin are mainly responsible for their interaction. We next examined whether Axam and Axin co-localize in intact cells. When GFP-Axam-(72–588) was expressed alone in SW480 cells, it was present in the cytoplasm diffusely (Fig.3 A). Consistent with previous observations (25Fagotto F. Jho E. Zeng L. Kurth T. Joos T. Kaufmann C. Costantini F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 26Kishida S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27682-27688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), Myc-rAxin was localized to distinct cytoplasmic vesicles which varied in size in SW480 cells (Fig.3 B). When co-expressed with Myc-rAxin, GFP-Axam-(72–588) was localized to the vesicles where Myc-rAxin was observed (Fig.3 , C–E). Therefore, it is likely that Axam co-localizes and forms a complex with Axin in the cells. To examine whether the interaction of Axam with Axin is direct, we purified GST-Axam, its deletion mutants, and MBP-rAxin from E. coli (Fig.4 A, lanes 1–5). GST-Axam (full length) and GST-Axam-(72–588) bound to MBP-rAxin, but GST-Axam-(1–113) did not (Fig. 4 A, lanes 6–8). GST-Axam or its mutants did not bind to MBP (Fig. 4 A, lanes 9–11). Since GST-Axam (full length) is relatively hard to purify, GST-Axam-(72–588) was used for the biochemical studies described below. GST-Axam-(72–588) bound to MBP-rAxin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 B). To examine which region of rAxin is required for its interaction with Axam, various deletion mutants including MBP-rAxin-(1–229), MBP-rAxin-(298–506), MBP-rAxin-(508–832), and MBP-rAxin-(713–832) were purified. GST-Axam-(72–588) bound to MBP-rAxin-(508–832) strongly and MBP-rAxin-(298–506) weakly but not to MBP-rAxin-(1–229) or MBP-rAxin-(713–832) (Fig. 4 C). These results suggest that the region containing residues 508–712 of rAxin binds directly to that containing residues 114–588 of Axam, consistent with the results obtained with intact cells. As shown in Figs. 2 and 4, Axam bound to residues 508–712 of Axin. Since Dvl-1 also binds directly to this region of Axin (26Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Hino S.-I. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4414-4422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether Dvl and Axam share the same binding site on Axin. To this end, MBP-rAxin-(508–620) and MBP-rAxin-(620–712) were purified (Fig.5 A, lanes 1 and 2). GST-Axam-(72–588) and GST-Dvl-1 interacted with MBP-rAxin-(508–620) (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5 and 6) but not with MBP-rAxin-(620–712) (Fig. 5 A, lanes 7 and 8). These results suggest that rAxin-(508–620) contains the Dvl- and Axam-binding sites. Therefore, we examined whether Axam inhibits the binding of Dvl to Axin in intact cells. Myc-rAxin, HA-Dvl-1, and GFP-Axam were co-expressed in COS cells (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1–5, 11, and 12). When the expression levels of GFP-Axam increased, the amounts of HA-Dvl-1 complexed with Myc-rAxin were reduced (Fig. 5 B, lanes 6–10). Furthermore, expression of HA-Dvl-1 reduced the complex formation of Myc-rAxin with GFP-Axam (Fig.5 B, lanes 13 and 14). These results suggest that Axam and Dvl compete with each other for the binding to Axin in intact cells. However, Axam did not inhibit the complex formation of β-catenin, GSK-3β, or PP2A with Axin (Fig. 5 C). Dvl-1 inhibits the GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of Axin, β-catenin, and APC in the Axin complex in vitro (22Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Kishida M. Ikeda S. Takada S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10681-10684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 26Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Hino S.-I. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4414-4422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined whether Axam affects this function of Dvl-1 in intact cells. When Myc-rAxin immunoprecipitated from COS cells with the anti-Myc antibody was applied to a 6% SDS-PAGE gel, a ladder of slower migrating bands of Myc-rAxin was observed (Fig.6 A, lane 1). These high molecular weight bands were decreased by the treatment with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 6 A, lane 2). When COS cells expressing Myc-rAxin were treated with okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, the high molecular weight band of Myc"
https://openalex.org/W2112406443,"Dehydroaltenusin was found to be an inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha) in vitro. Surprisingly, among the polymerases and DNA metabolic enzymes tested, dehydroaltenusin inhibited only mammalian pol alpha. Dehydroaltenusin did not influence the activities of the other replicative DNA polymerases, such as delta and epsilon; it also showed no effect even on the pol alpha activity from another vertebrate (fish) or plant species. The inhibitory effect of dehydroaltenusin on mammalian pol alpha was dose-dependent, and 50% inhibition was observed at a concentration of 0.5 microm. Dehydroaltenusin-induced inhibition of mammalian pol alpha activity was competitive with the template-primer and non-competitive with the dNTP substrate. BIAcore analysis demonstrated that dehydroaltenusin bound to the core domain of the largest subunit, p180, of mouse pol alpha, which has catalytic activity, but did not bind to the smallest subunit or the DNA primase p46 of mouse pol alpha. These results suggest that the dehydroaltenusin molecule competes with the template-primer molecule on its binding site of the catalytic domain of mammalian pol alpha, binds to the site, and simultaneously disturbs dNTP substrate incorporation into the template-primer."

Physiol. 1992; 263: C348-C356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has been shown to activate CaCC across the apical membrane of airway epithelia. The unique identity of this pathway in airway epithelia was established in studies of CF nasal epithelia, which demonstrated that Ca2+ionophores are effective Cl− secretogogues in CF tissues (12Willumsen N.J. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C226-C233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Boucher R.C. Cheng E.H.C. Paradiso A.M. Stutts M.J. Knowles M.R. Earp H.S. J. Clin.

Moreover, in the airways of the CFTR(−/−) knockout mouse, which definitively lacks CFTR (15Snouwaert J.N. Brigman K.K. Latour A.M. Malouf N.N. Boucher R.C. Smithies O. Koller B.H. Science. 1992; 257: 1083-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), not only is the CaCC pathway preserved, but it appears to be up-regulated (16Grubb B.R. Vick R.N. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1478-C1483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the airway epithelium, Cl− secretion is dependent on the development of a favorable driving force, because at basal conditions Cl− is at or near electrochemical equilibrium across the apical membrane. Ca2+i can stimulate Cl− secretion by multiple mechanisms. Elevation of Ca2+i can directly activate an apical membrane-localized Cl− conductance and thereby stimulate an apical exit pathway for Cl− secretion. Ca2+mobilizing agents can also cause a hyperpolarization in the cell to generate a driving force for Cl− secretion across the apical membrane by either (or both) inhibiting an apical membrane Na+ conductance (17Devor D.C. Pilewski J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C827-C837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or activating a basolateral K+ conductance. Thus study of Ca2+i-activated Cl− conductance in the apical membrane of a polarized epithelium requires a means to identify the contributions of apical Cl− conductance in isolation from other actions. Previous studies in non-polarized secretory epithelia, e.g.airway epithelia or T84 cells plated as isolated or dissociated cells, have shown outwardly rectifying Cl−currents stimulated by intracellular Ca2+ and sensitive to 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (DIDS) (18Egan M.

These descriptions have included such a wide range of Cl−channel characteristics that no consensus on the characteristics of this channel can be achieved (25Ishikawa T. Cook D.I. J. Membr.

The single channel properties and the cellular localization of these gene products, however, have not yet been determined. Thus, no indisputably apical Ca2+-activated Cl− channel has been identified at either the molecular or single channel level. We have recently identified a CaCC current expressed in immortalized CF and normal murine tracheal epithelial cell lines (33Gabriel, S. E., Thomas, E. J., Makhlina, M., Hardy, S. P., and Lethem, M. I. (1999) Am. J. Physiol., in press.Google Scholar). In the current study we used permeabilization of the basolateral membrane to determine the basic biophysical properties of the CaCC current in a functionally isolated apical membrane of airway epithelial cells. We have accomplished basolateral permeabilization by a novel approach involving stable transfection of the P2X7 purinoreceptor (P2X7-R) into our murine CF tracheal epithelial cell line. The P2X7-R is unique within its family, because binding of nucleotides (ATP4− is the preferred agonist) to this receptor results in the formation of a membrane pore that is capable of conducting molecules as large as 900 daltons (34Humphreys B.D. Virginio C. Suprenant A. Rice J. Dubyak G.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 35Rassendren F. Buell G.N. Virginio C. Collo G. North A. Surprenant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5482-5486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The pore is not ion-selective and allows for free diffusion of both cations and anions. Thus, by application of ATP selectively to the basolateral solution, we can selectively permeabilize this barrier. We report here the characterization of CaCC in the apical membrane of a CF tracheal epithelial cell line when activated by different classes of Ca2+i-mobilizing agents (UTP and ionomycin). We have determined the halide selectivity and inhibitor sensitivity of this Cl− current unambiguously localized to the apical membrane. Importantly, these observations will provide us with the hallmark characteristics for comparison with subsequent whole cell and single channel studies and will enable us to evaluate CaCC candidate genes. A greater understanding of the characteristics and mechanism of regulation of the CaCC pathway is essential for development of pharmacological therapies designed to use CaCC as an alternate Cl− channel to replace the defective CFTR. These studies utilized the immortalized murine tracheal epithelial cell line (MTE18) derived from the CFTR(−/−) knockout mouse, described previously (33Gabriel, S. E., Thomas, E. J., Makhlina, M., Hardy, S. P., and Lethem, M. I. (1999) Am. J. Physiol., in press.Google Scholar). Cells were maintained and cultured at 33 °C, the permissive temperature for the immortalizing tsA58 TAg activity (33Gabriel, S. E., Thomas, E. J., Makhlina, M., Hardy, S. P., and Lethem, M. I. (1999) Am. J. Physiol., in press.Google Scholar) on “Transwell-col” culture inserts. Culture medium consisted of a 1:1 mix of Ham's F12 and 3T3 fibroblast-conditioned medium supplemented with the following hormones: transferrin (2.5 mg/ml), insulin (5 mg/ml), epidermal growth factor (12.5 ng/ml), endothelial cell growth supplement (1.875 mg/ml), triiodothyronine (15 nm), hydrocortisone (0.5 mm), and CaCl2 (0.5 mm). Cells were harvested for experimental studies by trypsinization and plated at high density (2 × 104 cells per mm2) onto tissue culture inserts (collagen matrix supports with a 4.5-mm plating diameter) and evaluated for confluence by daily monitoring of transepithelial resistance (R T) and potential difference (V T). Only monolayers generating at least a 1.0-millivolt (mV) V T and a 100-Ω·cm2 resistance (after the resistance of the permeable support is subtracted) were used for Ussing chambers studies, typically 5–7 days after plating. Electrical measurements,i.e. V T, R T, and short-circuit current (I SC), were made on cell monolayers mounted in Ussing chambers. Monolayers were bathed in a Krebs bicarbonate Ringer solution (KBR) on both the lumenal and the serosal sides. Serosal Ca2+ was buffered to 300 nm with the addition of EGTA (achieved by the addition of 1 mm EGTA and 0.925 mm Ca2+). Other alterations to the bathing solutions are listed in the figure legends. All bathing solutions were bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and maintained at 37 °C. V Twas clamped to zero and pulsed to ±10 mV for a 0.5-s duration every minute. Electrometer output was digitized online andI SC, R T, and calculated transepithelial potential (V T) were displayed on a video monitor and stored on a computer hard drive. Drugs were added from concentrated stock solutions to either lumenal and/or serosal sides of the tissue. To eliminate the contribution of apical Na+ channels, amiloride (10−4m) was added to the lumenal bath at the outset of all experiments. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. for the number of experiments (n). Student's t test was used to determine statistical significance between means. Basolateral membrane permeabilization was achieved by stable transfection of the recombinant P2X7-R (a generous gift from Dr. George Dubyak) into the MTE18 cell line. A cDNA construct of the P2X7-R was cloned into a retroviral expression vector with a selectable puromycin-resistance gene. Infection of the MTE18 cell line with this retroviral vector and selection of resistant colonies in puromycin-containing media resulted in the identification of several cell clones that were puromycin-resistant and were verified for expression of P2X7-R. These P2X7-R-expressing cells were plated on membrane supports and used for Ussing chamber studies. Following recording of stable baseline I SC andR T (15–20 min in symmetrical Cl−KBR solutions), 1 mm ATP4− (UTP is not an agonist for the P2X7-R) was added to the serosal solution and serosal Mg2+ was reduced to 100 μm to activate the pore (divalent cations inhibit pore formation). Following successful permeabilization, documented by a drop in theI SC to 0 μA/cm2, the lumenal solution was diluted by three successive 1-ml replacements of KBR with a low Cl− containing (4.8 mm Cl−, 110 mm gluconate−) KBR. This maneuver generates a gradient for Cl− secretion with a serosal Cl− concentration of 115 mm and a final lumenal Cl− concentration of ≈68 mm. Ca2+i-mobilizing agents were added to the lumenal solution after the final dilution step. Anion selectivity was determined by a similar strategy used to generate the Cl−gradients. Briefly, three successive 1-ml replacements of the lumenal solution with a modified KBR solution containing a halide ion (I−, Br−) were substituted for Cl− (e.g. 4.8 mm Cl−, 110 mm I−). The inhibitor profile of CaCC was determined by the addition of inhibitors to the lumenal solution after the imposition of the Cl− gradient and prior to stimulation by UTP. All experiments consisted of alterations in the ion composition of the mucosal or serosal solution, followed by CaCC activation by addition of lumenal UTP. In a subset of experiments we used the α-toxin ofStaphylococcus aureus to permeabilize MTE18 or MTE7b (CFTR(+/−) cells) monolayers not expressing the P2X7-R. 1000 units of α-toxin was introduced to the serosal compartment bathing MTE18 or MTE7b monolayers and monitored for ∼60 min until theI SC dropped to 0 μA/cm2, indicating permeabilization. Subsequent dilutions and agonist additions were performed as described for P2X7-R monolayers. In CF and normal airway epithelial cells, mucosal nucleotides, ATP or UTP, acting via purinergic receptors cause an increase in I SC by reducing the apical membrane resistance with little or no effect on the basolateral or shunt resistance, i.e. by directly activating an apical membrane conductance (11Clarke L.L. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C348-C356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were performed under voltage clamp conditions (clamped to 0 mV) and in the presence of a Cl− gradient followed by the addition of mucosal UTP. Our experimental protocol defines the CaCC current as ΔI CaCC = I UTP −I gradient. Because the transepithelial potential is clamped to 0 mV, the equilibrium potential for Cl− can be calculated as ECl− = ΔICaCC ΔG CaCC and is determined by the chemical driving force imposed as a result of the Cl− gradient. This measured ECl− should ideally equal the calculated ECl−determined by the Nernst equation. We used the measuredE ion (Cl−, Br−, I−) values to determine a permselectivity sequence. Apparent differences between the measured E ionand Nernst equation-calculated E ion values are likely caused by ion permeation and accumulation in the unstirred layer closely adjacent to the membrane surface (37Illek B. Tam A.W. Fischer H. Machen T.E. Pfluegers Arch. 1999; 437: 812-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All biochemicals used were obtained from commercial sources and were of tissue culture grade or better. Transfection and expression of P2X7-R in MTE18 cells followed by incubation of monolayers with 1 mm ATP and 10 μm ToPro-1-iodide (a membrane-impermeant dye that fluoresces when bound to DNA, M r = 645) demonstrates efficient membrane permeabilization (Fig.1). Although cells exposed to ATP for either 10 or 30 min showed distinct intracellular fluorescence (Fig. 1,right two panels), P2X7-R-expressing cells not exposed to ATP showed no significant fluorescence beyond background levels (Fig. 1, left two panels). Control MTE18 cells or MTE18 cells expressing the control LISN vector, did not show any intracellular fluorescence in response to a 30-min exposure with 1 mm ATP (data not shown). We used this cell line (murine tracheal CFTR(−/−) epithelial cells, expressing P2X7-R) and selective permeabilization of the basolateral membrane to characterize CaCC resident in the apical membrane of airway epithelial cells. Basolateral membrane permeabilization of murine tracheal epithelial cells followed by imposition of a Cl− gradient and activation by mucosal UTP revealed the presence of an apical membrane Cl− current (Fig. 2). Application of a cell to lumen Cl− gradient resulted in a greater response in monolayers exposed to serosal 1 mm ATP than to cells not permeabilized by ATP (Fig. 2 B, 34.4 ± 9.2 versus 7.5 ± 2.4 μA/cm2). Importantly, addition of mucosal UTP to permeabilized cell monolayers was still capable of stimulating an increase inI SC consistent with Cl− secretion (Fig. 2 A, solid line trace, and Fig.2 B, right panel, filled bar). Similar responses to both an imposed Cl− gradient and mucosal UTP addition (ΔI SC = 54 ± 7.4 and 32.1 ± 8.9 μA/cm2, n = 8, respectively) were observed in MTE18 (CF) monolayers permeabilized by S. aureusα-toxin. The magnitude of the Cl− secretory response to the purinergic agonist UTP was significantly greater in α-toxin-permeabilized MTE18 preparations than in α-toxin-permeabilized MTE7B (normal) preparations (32.1 ± 8.9 μA/cm2, n = 8; 10.9 ± 3.7 μA/cm2, n = 8, respectively,p < .001). Elevation of intracellular Ca2+by inclusion of the ionophore, ionomycin (1 μm), showed a similar ability to stimulate Cl− secretion in permeabilized CF monolayers (25.8 ± 6.6 μA/cm2,n = 8). We have used several solution changes to verify that the observed current in MTE18-P2X7-R cells is a Cl−current. As shown above (Fig. 2) Cl− secretion (serosal to mucosal) is stimulated by imposition of a chemical gradient (i.e. lower Cl− concentration in the lumenal solution). Reversal of this gradient, by decreasing the serosal Cl− concentration in permeabilized preparations, results in stimulation of “Cl− absorption” (mucosal to serosal) (Fig. 3). When the Cl− concentration in the lumenal solution was maintained at 115 mm and the serosal solution was sequentially reduced, an absorptive Cl− current was recorded (Fig.3 A). The magnitude of the response was similar to the response observed for Cl− secretion (Fig. 2) but in the opposite direction (68.8 ± 7.4 versus 54.1 ± 8.2 μA/cm2, respectively). Mucosal UTP was likewise able to augment this basal level of Cl− absorption by 18.2 ± 15.8 μA/cm2. MTE18-P2X7-R cells that were not permeabilized (not exposed to serosal ATP) did not respond to the imposed absorptive gradient (data not shown). We also studied the magnitude of the Cl− current when the serosal Cl− concentration was reduced to levels that approximate intracellular Cl− (∼35 mm). We then imposed an outwardly directed Cl− gradient by reducing lumenal Cl− to a similar ratio as previously studied (final mucosal Cl− was diluted to a value of approximately 56% of the serosal concentration). Under these conditions, UTP was still capable of stimulating a characteristically similar Cl− response, although the magnitude of the response was smaller than that observed with higher Cl−concentrations (Fig. 3 B). The previous series of experiments involved dilution of the Cl− concentration by substitution with the less permeant anion gluconate−. This in effect results in a bi-ionic permselectivity relation, which provides an opportunity to determine the relative permeabilities of Cl− and gluconate. We subsequently performed similar experiments in which Cl−was substituted with Br− or I− (Fig.4). Substitution of Cl− with gluconate showed an increase in secretory Cl− current (serosal to mucosal) as expected for a Cl− dominated current. Both bromide and iodide substitution significantly attenuated the magnitude of this current, indicating that both of these halides, I− and Br− were more permeable than gluconate but less permeable than Cl−. Simply considering the Cl− concentration on either side of the membrane, the Nernst equation would predict an equilibrium potential of −13.6 mV. With gluconate as the counterion, we calculated an ECl− of ≈−9.8 mV. When bromide was substituted for Cl−, the calculated ECl− was ≈−6.7 mV, and when iodide was used as the counterion, ECl− was calculated to be ≈−3.8 mV. These increasing differences away from the Nernst equilibrium potential describe an anion selectivity sequence that is Cl− > I− > Br− > gluconate−. Several putative Cl− channel blockers were investigated for inhibition of UTP-stimulated Cl− secretion in P2X7-R-permeabilized MTE18 cells (Fig.5). The most efficacious compounds appeared to be niflumic acid (NFA) (100 μm) and 5′-nitrophenyl-propylbenzoate (NPPB; 100 μm), both of which inhibited approximately 90% of the CaCC-mediated current. The most routinely used Cl− channel blocker, DIDS (100 μm), inhibited slightly more than 60% of the UTP-stimulated current, whereas glybenclamide (100 μm), a K+ channel blocker that has been shown to have efficacy against CFTR (38Sheppard D.N. Robinson K.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 503: 333-346Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar), blocked about 40% of the UTP-stimulated current. Finally, TS-TM calixarene (1 μm), a reported inhibitor specific for the outward rectifying Cl− channel (36Singh A.K. Venglarik C.J. Bridges R.J. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 985-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the anti-estrogen tamoxifen (10 μm), shown to inhibit the human ClCA2 channel (32Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D. Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1261-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC) (100 μm) were essentially without effect (<10% inhibition) on the UTP-stimulated current. We have previously shown that UTP, ionomycin, and thapsigargin are all capable of stimulating a Cl−current in both CF and normal murine airway epithelial cells (33Gabriel, S. E., Thomas, E. J., Makhlina, M., Hardy, S. P., and Lethem, M. I. (1999) Am. J. Physiol., in press.Google Scholar). In that study we demonstrated the presence of the Ca2+-activated Cl− current and noted that the magnitude of the current was greater in CF (MTE18) than in normal (MTE7b) cells. In this study we have used permeabilization of the basolateral membrane to focus on an “apically isolated” preparation. Efficacy of permeabilization is apparent by the greater response to the imposed gradient observed in the permeabilizedversus non-permeabilized preparations (comparefilled with open bars in Fig. 2 B). Dilutions of the lumenal solution in non-permeabilized monolayers leads to only minor changes in current, but subsequent addition of UTP generates a large change in current. In permeabilized preparations, a large increase in current is observed in response to both changes in the Cl− concentration, as well as the addition of UTP. Importantly, nucleotides ATP/UTP acting via the purinoreceptor, P2Y2, have been shown to directly reduce the apical membrane resistance with no effect on the resistance of the tight junction (11Clarke L.L. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C348-C356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our experimental design, imposition of a chemical gradient for Cl− is likely to have effects on both the apical membrane conductance and the paracellular pathway, but application of UTP will only stimulate Cl− secretion by activation of an apical membrane Cl− channel. Thus, the response to UTP following permeabilization and imposition of the Cl− gradient is convincing evidence for the existence of a Ca2+i-activated apical membrane Cl−channel. Furthermore, an increase in I SC in response to ionomycin is also confirmatory evidence that the Ca2+i-mediated effects are the result of an apical Cl− conductance rather than an effect on the paracellular pathway. In an intact preparation, Ca2+ activation of K+channels in the basolateral membrane likely plays an important role in maintaining the driving force necessary for Cl− secretion. One obvious advantage of a permeabilized preparation is that we can eliminate the need for basolateral K+ channels by imposing a gradient by solution changes and thereby directly focus on the apical membrane. With these maneuvers we have shown that a Ca2+i-activated Cl− conductance is present in the apical membrane of murine tracheal epithelial cells. Interestingly, UTP and ionomycin regulate this apical membrane Cl− conductance even when Ca2+i is buffered to moderate levels (300 nm) by EGTA. This suggests that the accessory proteins necessary for regulation are not dialyzed by permeabilization and that the mechanisms for intracellular Ca2+ release are also well preserved. Somewhat surprising, however, was the observation that UTP consistently activated this Cl− conductance in the presence of 1 mm EGTA. EGTA is relatively slow in terms of buffering Ca2+ and may not be able to rapidly chelate release from local Ca2+stores efficiently (39Adler E.M. Augustine G.J. Duffy S.N. Charlton M.P. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1496-1507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Nichols R.A. Suplick G.R. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 211: 135-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This experimental protocol allows us to buffer Ca2+ to physiological levels and preserves the ability to observe a UTP-mediated current response. These data are consistent with whole cell patch clamp studies that showed ATP-activated Cl− currents in human airway epithelial cells in the presence of 10 mm EGTA (41Stutts M.J. Fitz J.G. Paradiso A.M. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1442-C1451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that UTP-stimulated currents in non-permeabilized MTE18 cells can be abolished by BAPTA-AM (33Gabriel, S. E., Thomas, E. J., Makhlina, M., Hardy, S. P., and Lethem, M. I. (1999) Am. J. Physiol., in press.Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that the UTP-stimulated current is Ca2+-dependent, but that released Ca2+ is capable of activating a target before it can be chelated by EGTA. Heterologous expression of P2X7-R in MTE18 cells provides a reliable, consistent, and rapid technique to generate an apically isolated preparation. Characteristically, the Cl−secretory response to the imposed Cl− gradient and to the lumenal addition of UTP is similar to the responses observed in α-toxin permeabilized monolayers. Challenging P2X7-R-expressing monolayers with ATP and the fluorescent DNA-intercalating agent, ToPro-1-iodide, demonstrated that P2X7-R effectively forms a pore sufficient for dialysis of the intracellular ion solution. These studies show that nearly every cell was expressing P2X7-R and that receptor expression alone did not confer an increase in cell conductance, but rather that receptor occupancy by ATP was an absolute requirement for pore formation. Reversal of the Cl− gradient confirmed that the preparation was permeabilized and also established that the current was Cl−-selective. Stable expression of P2X7-R allows us an opportunity to determine the characteristics of the Ca2+i-activated Cl− conductance of the apical membrane in CF murine tracheal epithelial cells. This novel protocol for membrane permeabilization (transfection and activation of P2X7-R) has the further advantage of serving as a self-contained control for permeabilization. By not exposing the cells to millimolar basolateral ATP, the cells function as an intact monolayer, thus the same monolayer preparation can be used for both non-permeabilized and permeabilized protocols. We have characterized apical membrane CaCC in these preparations in terms of ion selectivity and inhibitor sensitivity. As mentioned earlier, several reports have provided differing characteristics for the CaCC. We believe that characterization in the CF murine airway apical membrane will provide the hallmark characteristics for this channel for subsequent whole cell and single channel analyses. Initial studies in P2X7-R-permeabilized monolayers (Figs. 2 and 3) demonstrated a Cl− current in response to a gradient that was generated by partial replacement of the mucosal Cl−with the less permeant anion, gluconate. Although this fundamentally important experiment demonstrates the presence of the apical membrane Cl− conductance, it also in fact serves as the first in a series of ion replacement studies. Although gluconate is often used as an “impermeant” anion, it is really only less permeant than the halide series. Therefore, a bi-ionic solution of Cl− and gluconate can be evaluated for permselectivity based on the magnitude of the current response and a calculated equilibrium potential. As observed in Fig. 4, not surprisingly, Cl− is more permeant than gluconate and results in a Cl− current from serosal to mucosal solution. In contrast, when the mucosal Cl− is partially replaced with iodide or bromide, we observed a smaller UTP-induced secretion and a greater shift from the ideal equilibrium potential, suggesting an ion series for this apical Cl−conductance of Cl− > I− > Br−> gluconate−. This anion selectivity sequence is somewhat similar to other reports of Ca2+-activated Cl−channels (14Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1996; 93: 13362-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Cl− channel blockers were investigated to determine a “sensitivity sequence” for the CaCC channel. Pretreatment of permeabilized monolayers with the Cl− channel blockers was used to determine a percentage inhibition of the UTP-mediated Cl− current. The rank order of potency for channel inhibitors appears to be NFA, NPPB (≈90%) > DIDS (≈60%) > glybenclamide (≈ 40%) ≫ tamoxifen, TS-TM calixarene, and DPC (0–10%). The very low, nearly non-existent effect of TS-TM calixarene was consistent with previous studies that defined this compound as a specific inhibitor of the outward rectifying Cl− channel (36Singh A.K. Venglarik C.J. Bridges R.J. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 985-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The moderate effect of glybenclamide on CaCC was a bit surprising, because this sulfonylurea compound was thought to be fairly specific for K-ATP and CFTR channels (45Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 573-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 46Schultz B.D. DeRoos A.D.G. Venglarik C.J. Singh A.K. Frizzell R.A. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L192-L200PubMed Google Scholar). In many studies DIDS is reported to be a highly effective inhibitor of Ca2+-activated Cl− conductance (18Egan M. Flotte T. Afione S. Solow R.

Pulmonol. 1993; 9(Suppl.): 223-224Google Scholar), and although we observed moderate inhibition, it was not as effective as NFA. Higher doses of DIDS may generate higher levels of inhibition, but we are sensitive to the concerns of cross-linking that are associated with this compound. In our studies NFA was the most potent inhibitor of CaCC but like many Cl− channel blockers lacks specificity, as it has been shown to also inhibit CFTR in human airways (47Gabriel S.E. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Pediatr. Pulmonol. 1993; 9(Suppl.): 223-224Google Scholar, 48Zegarra-Moran O. Sacco O. Romano L. Rossi G.A. Galietta L.J.V. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These studies serve to confirm the notion that Cl− channel blockers are notoriously nonspecific, and inhibitor studies should be used simply as another characteristic to define the observed current. That is, an inhibitor order of potency or sensitivity sequence should serve an analogous function as a halide permselectivity sequence. The identity of the current should be defined by a combination of those characteristic sequences rather than any single effect. Tamoxifen has recently been shown to have inhibitory effects against the human ClCA2 channel (32Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D. Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1261-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, tamoxifen was without effect in our CF murine tracheal epithelial cells. Furthermore, we have not been able to detect the murine homologue of this channel, mClCA1, by Northern blot analysis in our CF murine tracheal epithelial cells, suggesting that the apical membrane Ca2+i-activated Cl− conductance is mediated by a thus far unidentified gene or protein. We propose to utilize the activation, inhibition, and selectivity characteristics determined in this study for future experiments studying whole cell currents and single channel properties and ensure that the channel characteristics are consistent at each level of investigation. This systematic approach will result in the unambiguous identification of the murine airway CaCC localized to the apical membrane. Identification of CaCC along with a determination of regional distribution within the lung will permit us to develop strategies to activate CaCC and stimulate Cl− and fluid secretion and thereby ameliorate the dehydration that is foremost in the pathology of cystic fibrosis.

Interaction with the chemokine receptor activates the membrane fusion activity of gp120/gp41, probably by triggering a conformational change in gp41.

The resulting 424-bp PCR product was gel-purified and reamplified with BC-16 and BC-44 (5′-GCTCTAGAAGGGACGCTGTGAAGCAATCATGGATGCAATGAAGAGAGGGCTCTGCTGTGTGCTGCTGCTGTGT-3′) to give a 477-bp fragment, which was subsequently digested withXbaI and NsiI and gel-purified. This fragment was ligated with a 1.4-kb NsiI–EcoRI fragment from pFBSIVΔV1V2 (see below) or a 1.4-kb NsiI–EcoRI fragment from pFBSIVΔV1V2V3 (see below) and then cloned into pEE14 (48Kingston R.E.

In all cases, the posttranslational cleavage sites (residues 512 and 523) between gp120 and gp41 have been mutated as shown to prevent cleavage and dissociation of gp120. pNES1ΔV1V2V3 has a shorter tissue plasminogen activator leader sequence than pSIV-M, while both pFBSIV-His1, and pFBSIVΔV1V2V3-His1 use the honeybee melittin (HM) secretion signal. The cleavage sites after the leader sequences were confirmed by N-terminal sequencing of the expressed products and are indicated by arrows beneath the sequences. The sequences where the V1, V2, and V3 segments were deleted and replaced with a GAG linker (in italics) are shown for pNES1ΔV1V2V3 and pFBSIVΔV1V2V3-His1. The sequences where the transmembrane segment of gp41 was truncated are also shown for all constructs.

The pSIV-M was amplified by PCR using primers BC-1 (5′-CGCGGATCCGACTCAATATGTCACAGTCTTTTAT-3′) and BC-2 (5′-GGCCGAATTCTATATCCAAGAAGCAAGG-3′) to produce a DNA fragment encompassing the complete SIV gp160e coding sequence. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, gel-purified, and cloned into pMelBac (Invitrogen) to generate an intermediate construct pBacSIV-5, which was sequenced using primers BC-1, BC-2, BC-6 (5′-CACCAACGGCAGCATCAA-3′), BC-7 (5′-AGATGTAATGACACAAAT-3′), BC-8 (5′-AAATTGGAAGGATGCAAT-3′), BC-9 (5′-GAGACCTCACGTGTAACT-3′), BC-10 (5′-GTGCAGCAACAGCAACAG-3′), and BC-16 to verify the entire sequence of SIV gp160e open reading frame. pBacSIV-5 was then amplified using primers BC-14 (5′-TTTATGGTCGTATACATTTCTTACATCTATGCGACTCAATATGTCACAGTC-3′) and BC-16. The resulting PCR product was reamplified by BC-13 (5′-CGCGGATCCATGAAATTCTTAGTCAACGTTGCCCTTGTTTTTATGGTCGTATACATT-3′) and BC-16 to produce a 447-bp fragment, which was digested withBamHI and NsiI, gel-purified, and designated as fragment 1. This fragment allows fusion of the N terminus of SIV gp160e and the honeybee melittin secretion signal sequence. pBacSIV-5 was digested with NsiI and NcoI and gel-purified to give a 1.5-kb fragment, designated as fragment 2, which encompassed a major portion of SIV gp160e open reading frame. To introduce a histidine tag at the C terminus of SIV gp160e, a 757-bp PCR product was amplified using pBacSIV-5 as template and BC-9 and BC-24 (5′-CCGGAATTCTCAATGATGATGATGATGATGAGTGCGACCTTCGATTTGTATATACTTTATCCAAGA-3′) as primers and digested with NcoI andEcoRI, gel-purified, and designated as fragment 3. Fragments 1, 2, and 3 were ligated together and cloned into pFastBac-1 (Life Technologies, Inc.), digested with BamHI andEcoRI, to give the expression construct pFBSIV-His1. Constructs were also made to express SIV gp160e variants with deletions of segments V1, V2, and V3; of V1 and V2 only; or of V3 only. pFBSIV-His1 was amplified by PCR with primers BC-2 and BC-32 (5′-CCATTATGCATTGGAGCAGGTCACTGTAACACTTCTATTAT-3′), which replaces V1 and V2 segments with a short linker GAG. The PCR product was digested with NsiI and NcoI, gel-purified, and inserted into pFBSIV-His1, which was digested with NsiI and NcoI to generate pFBSIVΔV1V2-His1. pFBSIVΔV3-His3 was constructed by overlapping PCR. pBacSIV-5 was amplified with primers BC-1 and BC-43 (5′-ACACCAACCTGCTCCTCTACATTTCATTGTTAGATT-3′) and primers BC-18 (5′-TTGTATATACTTTATCCAAGAAGCAAG-3′) and BC-42 (5′-TGTAGAGGAGCAGGTTGGTGTTGGTTTGGAGGAAAT-3′) to produce two overlapped 892-bp and 1.0-kb fragments, respectively. These two fragments were gel-purified, mixed, and reamplified with primers BC-1 and BC-18 to give a 1.9-kb fragment in which the V3 segment was replaced with GAG linker. This fragment was then digested withNsiI and NcoI and cloned into pFBSIV-His1, which was also digested with NsiI and NcoI to generate pFBSIVΔV3-His3. To construct pFBSIVΔV1V2V3-His1, pFBSIVΔV3-His3 was used as a template to produce a 1.4-kb PCR fragment with primers BC-2 and BC-32 to replace V1 and V2 segments with a GAG. The PCR product was digested with NsiI and NcoI, gel-purified, and inserted into pFBSIV-His1, which was digested with NsiI andNcoI to generate pFBSIVΔV1V2V3-His1. pFBSIVΔV1V2 and pFBSIVΔV1V2V3 were also made to express gp160e variants without histidine tags. pBacSIV-5 was used as a template for PCR with primers BC-2 and BC-10. The PCR product was then digested with NcoI and EcoRI, gel-purified, and inserted into NcoI- and EcoRI-digested pFBSIVΔV3-His3 and pFBSIVΔV1V2V3-His1, respectively, to yield pFBSIVΔV1V2 and pFBSIVΔV1V2V3. Both restriction digestion and DNA sequencing verified all of the expression constructs. Recombinant baculovirus was generated according to the manufacturer's protocol and amplified in Sf9 insect cells in TNM-FH medium (Sigma). Expression of SIV gp160e was confirmed by a Western blot using sheep antisera against SIV envelope glycoprotein. The optimal amount of virus and postinfection harvest time was determined by small scale tests in 100-ml spinner flasks. Infected Trichoplusia ni (Hi-5) cells were found to secrete significantly more SIV gp160e than Sf9 cells, judging by Western blot. For large scale protein production, 10 liters of T. ni (Hi-5) cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) in Ex-Cell 405 medium (JRH Biosciences) were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 2.5. 3 days after infection, the supernatant was harvested by centrifugation and concentrated to 1 liter in a tangential flow filtration system, ProFlux M 12 (Millipore Corp.). The CHO Lec3.2.8.1 supernatants containing secreted SIV gp160e were harvested by centrifugation or by filtration through a Corning filter (0.22 mm). SIV gp160e was purified by an immunoaffinity chromatography using a mAb 17A11 3J. A. Hoxie,unpublished results. affinity column (5-ml bed volume), where the monoclonal antibody 17A11 was cross-linked at 5 mg/ml to GammaBind Plus Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with dimethyl pimelimidate (Pierce). The supernatants were passed through the column with a flow rate of about 0.5 ml/min. After extensive washing with PBS, the protein was then eluted with 100 mmglycine (pH 3.0), followed by immediate neutralization with 2m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing SIV gp160e were pooled, concentrated, and further purified by gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 200 or Superose 6 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mmNaCl. SIV gp160eΔ(V1V2) and gp160eΔ(V1V2V3) proteins were purified following the same procedure. SIV gp160e expressed from insect cells was purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography with ProBond resin (Invitrogen). Concentrated insect cell culture supernatants were immediately changed into 1× column buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl) in a ProFlux M 12 flow filtration system to remove small molecules in the medium that interfere with the binding of His-tagged SIV gp160e to the nickel column. After centrifugation at 5000 rpm in a JA-14 rotor (Beckman) for 15 min to remove insoluble materials, imidazole was added to the final concentration of 15 mm to reduce nonspecific binding to the resin. Batch binding was then performed at 4 °C for 3 h. After the column was packed (about 5-ml bed volume), the beads were washed by 100 ml of 1× column buffer containing 15 mm imidazole, followed by further washing with 50 ml of 40 mm imidazole in 1× column buffer. The protein was eluted with 300 mm imidazole in 1× column buffer. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing SIV gp160e were pooled, concentrated, and further purified by gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 200 or Superose 6 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a buffer containing 25 mmTris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl. SIV gp160eΔ(V1V2) and gp160eΔ(V1V2V3) proteins were purified following the same procedure. N-terminal analyses of purified proteins were carried out by the HHMI biopolymer facility. For chemical cross-linking experiments, SIV gp160e protein was dialyzed extensively against PBS. In 20-μl reactions, SIV gp160e (1 mg/ml) was incubated with ethylene glycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS; Pierce) at concentrations of 0.06, 0.18, 0.55, 1.67, and 5 mm respectively, on ice for 30 min. The reactions were then quenched by adding 5 μl of 100 mmTris-glycine (pH 7.0) and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. The cross-linked products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cross-linked phosphorylase b (Sigma) was used as an SDS-PAGE molecular weight standard. Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed on a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge at 4 °C. Experiments were performed at concentrations of 1.6 μm, 3.3 μm, and 6.5 μm protein and centrifuged at a rotor speed of 6000 rpm. Data were fitted to a single-species model. The protein partial specific volume and solvent density were calculated according to Laue et al. (49Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C.

The complexes were separated from excess unbound CD4 or Fabs by a gel filtration chromatography on Superose 6 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Molecular weights were calculated based on a standard curve plotted from the elution volumes of known proteins. Peak fractions were verified to contain both gp160e and CD4 or Fabs by SDS-PAGE. CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C using SIV gp160e at a concentration of 0.56 mg/ml in PBS with a circular dichroism spectrometer model 62DS (Aviv). The molar ellipticity [θ] was monitored as the average of 12 scans with 0.5-nm bandwidth and 1.0-nm wavelength increments from 195 to 260 nm. The spectra were corrected with a base line obtained using buffer alone under the same conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2092986485,"Homologous aquaporin water channels utilize different folding pathways to acquire their transmembrane (TM) topology in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). AQP4 acquires each of its six TM segments via cotranslational translocation events, whereas AQP1 is initially synthesized with four TM segments and subsequently converted into a six membrane-spanning topology. To identify sequence determinants responsible for these pathways, peptide segments from AQP1 and AQP4 were systematically exchanged. Chimeric proteins were then truncated, fused to a C-terminal translocation reporter, and topology was analyzed by protease accessibility. In each chimeric context, TM1 initiated ER targeting and translocation. However, AQP4-TM2 cotranslationally terminated translocation, while AQP1-TM2 failed to terminate translocation and passed into the ER lumen. This difference in stop transfer activity was due to two residues that altered both the length and hydrophobicity of TM2 (Asn49 and Lys51 in AQP1 versus Met48 and Leu50 in AQP4). A second peptide region was identified within the TM3–4 peptide loop that enabled AQP4-TM3 but not AQP1-TM3 to reinitiate translocation and cotranslationally span the membrane. Based on these findings, it was possible to convert AQP1 into a cotranslational biogenesis mode similar to that of AQP4 by substituting just two peptide regions at the N terminus of TM2 and the C terminus of TM3. Interestingly, each of these substitutions disrupted water channel activity. These data thus establish the structural basis for different AQP folding pathways and provide evidence that variations in cotranslational folding enable polytopic proteins to acquire and/or maintain primary sequence determinants necessary for function.

In cell membranes, aquaporins exist primarily as higher ordered structures. AQP1 forms stable tetramers, with each monomer comprising a functional channel (13Shi L.-B. Skach W. Verkman A. J. Biol.

A closely related aquaporin, AQP4, also forms tetramers which are organized into large macromolecular arrays (16Yang B. Brown D. Verkman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4577-4580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 17Verbavatz J. Ma T. Gobin R. Verkman A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2855-2860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both AQP1 and AQP4 form high capacity water-selective channels, suggesting that they share similar overall structural features (18Yang B. Verkman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16140-16146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic aquaporins are synthesized and assembled in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). During this process TM segments are oriented with respect to the ER membrane and integrated into the lipid bilayer (19Skach W. Shi L.-B. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V. Verkman A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Shi L.-B. Skach W. Ma T. Verkman A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8250-8256Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These early biogenesis events are likely mediated via specific interactions between the Sec61 ER translocation machinery and topogenic sequence determinants (e.g. signal and stop transfer sequences) encoded within the nascent polypeptide (21Laird V. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 1983-1989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Johnson A.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 132-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, topogenic determinants have been identified in AQP1 and AQP4 and shown to direct specific translocation and integration events (19Skach W. Shi L.-B. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V. Verkman A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Shi L.-B. Skach W. Ma T. Verkman A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8250-8256Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Despite their homology and similar function, AQP1 and AQP4 encode topogenic determinants with very different translocation properties. AQP4 contains three internal signal anchor sequences and three stop transfer sequences that sequentially initiate and terminate polypeptide translocation as the nascent chain emerges from the ribosome (20Shi L.-B. Skach W. Ma T. Verkman A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8250-8256Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These determinants thus establish six TM segments in a vectoral and cotranslational manner. AQP1, in contrast, encodes only two distinct signal sequences (TM1 and TM5) and two stop transfer sequences (TM3 and TM6) that cotranslationally establish four TM segments (19Skach W. Shi L.-B. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V. Verkman A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). AQP1-TM2 and TM4 are initially directed into the ER lumen and cytosol, respectively. Recent studies have revealed that this four membrane-spanning structure represents a folding intermediate that undergoes a topological reorientation during and following the completion of AQP1 synthesis (26Lu Y. Turnbull I. Bragin A. Carveth K. Verkman A. Skach W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2973-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas mature AQP1 and AQP4 both exhibit a similar six membrane-spanning topology, the translocation, integration, and folding events that establish this topology are quite different. To determine why closely related proteins utilize different folding pathways, we used a series of chimeric AQP1-AQP4 proteins (diagrammed in Fig. 1) and compared the sequence determinants responsible for directing specific translocation events. Topologic analysis identified differences in two peptide regions. Hydrophilic residues flanking the N terminus of AQP1-TM2 (Asn49 and Lys51) prevented TM2 from functioning as a stop transfer sequence and terminating translocation. Similarly, residues within the TM3–4 peptide loop enabled AQP4-TM3 but not AQP1-TM3 to reinitiate translocation and cotranslationally span the membrane. Exchanging only these two regions in AQP1 with corresponding residues from AQP4 converted AQP1 to a cotranslational biogenesis pathway. However, the resulting chimeras lacked water channel activity. Taken together, our results demonstrate how minor sequence variations can significantly affect polytopic protein folding and provide an example in which a novel posttranslational biogenesis pathway is utilized in order to conserve structural determinants which are critical for function. AQP chimeras were engineered using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) overlap extension method (27Ho N. Hunt H. Horton R. Pullen J. Pease P. Gene (Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) (Vent DNA polymerase, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Complimentary oligonucleotides were designed to span the desired fusion site between AQP1 and AQP4 proteins (Table I). These oligonucleotides together with flanking 5′ and 3′ primers were used to perform two initial PCR reactions using template plasmids pSP64.CHIP28 (AQP1) and SP64T-MIWC (AQP4) described previously (19Skach W. Shi L.-B. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V. Verkman A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Shi L.-B. Skach W. Ma T. Verkman A.

The overlapping PCR fragments were then hybridized and used as templates for a third PCR amplification, thus “ligating” AQP1 and AQP4 sequences at the fusion site. Products of PCR 3 were digested with restriction enzymes (NcoI and AvaI for AQP1, and HindIII and BstXI for AQP4) and ligated into appropriately digested and phosphatase-digested pSP64.CHIP28 and SP64T-MIWC vectors to regenerate full-length proteins. For constructs where internal peptide regions were mutated or exchanged, this process was repeated using wild type or mutant AQP chimeras as the DNA template.

Specific fusion sites designed in PCR oligonucleotides are shown at right. ECL-1 refers to the first extracellular loop as diagramed in Figure 1. Fusion proteins containing the C-terminal translocation reporter were generated by amplifying wild type, mutant, or chimeric AQP coding sequences (10–15 cycles of PCR) using a sense oligonucleotide (SP6 promoter) and antisense oligonucleotides encoding a BstEII restriction site at AQP4 codons Val46, Gly72, Lys92, Val120, Val140, or AQP1 codons Val52, Pro77, Arg93, Val107, and Val139. Antisense oligonucleotides were identical to those described previously (19Skach W. Shi L.-B. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V. Verkman A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Shi L.-B. Skach W. Ma T. Verkman A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8250-8256Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and fusion sites are indicated in Fig. 1 B. PCR fragments were digested withNcoI and BstEII (AQP1 constructs) orHindIII and BstEII (AQP4 constructs) and ligated 5′ to a translocation reporter (P), which encodes 142 C-terminal residues from the secretory protein bovine prolactin. This reporter contains no intrinsic topogenic information and faithfully follows topogenic determinants in a wide variety of contexts (19Skach W. Shi L.-B. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V. Verkman A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Rothman R.E. Andrews D.W. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10470-10480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids thus encode AQP1 or AQP4 extending from residue 1 to the engineered BstEII truncation site followed by the P reporter. Wild type, mutant, or chimeric TM3 constructs were generated by PCR amplification using sense oligonucleotides TCAACCCCATGGTCACACTGGGGCTGCTG (AQP1) and TCAACCTCATGATCACAGTGGCCATGGTGTG (AQP4) that encode ATG start codons at residue Val79 and Ala77, respectively, and antisense oligonucleotides encoding a BstEII site at residue Leu139 (AQP1) or Val140 (AQP4). Fragments were digested with NcoI and BstEII and ligated into anNcoI/BstEII-digested vector containing the P reporter. All regions of cDNA generated by the PCR overlap extension were verified by DNA sequencing. Truncated constructs were verified by extensive restriction digestion and/or sequencing. mRNA was transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase (Epicenter, Technologies, Madison, WI) using 2 μg of plasmid DNA in a 10-μl volume at 40 °C for 1 h as described (19Skach W. Shi L.-B. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V. Verkman A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Transcription mixture was added directly to translation mixture containing [35S]methionine, 40% rabbit reticulocyte lysate (29Skach W. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and canine pancreas rough microsomal membranes prepared as described (30Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 4-93Google Scholar). Translation was carried out for 1 h at 24 °C (19Skach W. Shi L.-B. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V. Verkman A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 29Skach W. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Final concentration of membranes wasA 280 = 8.0, which resulted in >90% translocation and ∼80% glycosylation of control proteins (31Moss K. Helm A. Lu Y. Bragin A. Skach W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2681-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For protease digestion, the translation mixture was aliquoted on ice, and CaCl2 was added to 10 mm final concentration (19Skach W. Shi L.-B. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V. Verkman A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Proteinase K (PK) was then added (0.2 mg/ml) in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100. Samples were incubated on ice for 1 h, and residual protease was inactivated by rapid mixing with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 mm) and heating to 100 °C in 10 volumes of 1% SDS, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, for 5 min. Samples were then added directly to SDS loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Stage VI Xenopus laevis oocytes were harvested and maintained as described previously (32Zhang R. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: 26-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cRNA was transcribed from linearized plasmids using SP6 polymerase and microinjected into oocytes. Water permeability was determined 24–48 h following injection using a hypotonic swelling assay (32Zhang R. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: 26-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oocyte swelling was measured in response to a 20-fold dilution of the extracellular Barth's buffer with distilled water. Oocyte volume was measured in 1-s intervals by quantitative imaging. Temperature control was maintained by a circulating water bath. OocytePf was calculated from the initial rate of swelling,d(V/V 0)/dt, by the relation Pf = [d(V/V 0)/dt]/[(S/V 0)Vw(Osmout− Osmin], where S/V 0 = 50 cm-1, Vw = 18 cm3/mol, and Osmout − Osmin = 190 mOsm. SDS-PAGE gels were prepared using EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) fluorography and autoradiography according to manufacturers instructions. Autoradiograms were scanned using a Pharmacia LKB Image Master DTS densitometer and quantitated using Image Master 1D software version 1.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Prior to analysis, the densitometer was pre-calibrated with a Kodak photographic step tablet, and linearity was confirmed by serial dilution over a 40-fold concentration range and by phosphorimaging analysis (Bio-Rad Personal Molecular Imager Fx, Quant-1 software). Band intensities of autoradiograms and/or phosphorimaged gels were calculated as volume averaged pixel intensity (OD × mm2). Translocation efficiency was determined by correcting for the fractional methionine content of protease-protected peptide fragments relative to full-length polypeptides. Figs. were prepared using an Agfa Studio Scan II transmission scanner and Adobe Photoshop software. To compare the cotranslational translocation events that generate AQP1 and AQP4 topology, polypeptides were truncated at homologous sites following TM1, TM2, or TM3 and ligated to a C-terminal translocation reporter (P) derived from bovine prolactin (∼15 kDa in size). Fusion sites and resulting constructs are diagrammed in Figs. 1 and2 A. Topology of the reporter was then determined by protease accessibility following expression in rabbit reticulocyte lysate supplemented with canine pancreas rough microsomes (CRM). Under these conditions, the reporter is protected from exogenous protease only when it resides in the ER lumen and only in the absence of detergent (28Rothman R.E. Andrews D.W. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10470-10480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Skach W. Lingappa V. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3202-3209PubMed Google Scholar). Because the reporter domain encodes no intrinsic topogenic information and faithfully follows topogenic signals (19Skach W. Shi L.-B. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V. Verkman A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Rothman R.E. Andrews D.W. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10470-10480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it thus reflects the cotranslational topology of each fusion site at a particular stage of protein synthesis. Fig. 2 shows topology of the reporter engineered at five sequential fusion sites in AQP4 (gray) and AQP1 (black). Consistent with previous studies, each construct truncated after TM1 (residues Val46 (AQP4) or Val52 (AQP1) generated two protease-protected fragments (Fig. 2, B andC, lanes 1–3, downward arrows). For AQP4, we previously showed that the larger fragment represents the full-length construct, while the smaller fragment resulted from an internal cleavage event, likely at a cryptic signal peptidase recognition site (20Shi L.-B. Skach W. Ma T. Verkman A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8250-8256Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Similarly, the three bands generated from plasmid AQP1.52.P represent full-length glycosylated, full-length non-glycosylated, and signal peptidase-cleaved polypeptides (Fig. 2 C, lane 1, top,middle, and bottom bands, respectively) (19Skach W. Shi L.-B. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V. Verkman A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Based on the efficiency of PK protection, TM1 C-terminal flanking residues resided in the ER lumen in greater than 70% of AQP1 and AQP4 nascent chains. Non-glycosylated AQP1 chains were not protected and represent polypeptides that either failed to target to the ER or failed to effectively translocate the reporter. Previous experiments have confirmed that the N termini of both AQP1 and AQP4 reside in the cytosol, although they are inaccessible to protease (19Skach W. Shi L.-B. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V. Verkman A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,20Shi L.-B. Skach W. Ma T. Verkman A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8250-8256Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). AQP4 fusion sites at residues Gly72 and Lys92in AQP4, resided in the cytosol and were protease accessible (Fig.2 B, lanes 4–9). Residue Val120, at the C terminus of TM3, was also initially cytosolic (Fig. 2 B, lanes 10–12). However, after synthesis of 20 additional residues, the fusion site at Val140 was translocated into the ER lumen in >50% of nascent chains as demonstrated by N-linked glycosylation at residue Asn131 and generation of a protease-protected, 28-kDa glycosylated polypeptide fragment (Fig. 2 B,lanes 13 and 14, downward arrows). Glycosylation was confirmed by translation in the absence of CRM and/or in the presence of a tripeptide inhibitor of oligosaccharyltransferase (Ref. 20Shi L.-B. Skach W. Ma T. Verkman A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8250-8256Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar and data not shown). Note that PK cleavage within the TM2–3 connecting loop would be expected to generate a fragment containing the 15-kDa P reporter, 3 kDa ofN-linked carbohydrates, and 7 kDa of AQP4 polypeptide. Thus the protected fragment migrates slightly slower than its predicted size. The intensity of the fragment reflects that it contains only 44% of initial methionine residues. Taken together, these results support a cotranslational biogenesis model in which AQP4-TM1 targets the nascent chain-ribosome complex to the ER membrane and initiates translocation; TM2 terminates translocation, and TM3 (together with its C-terminal flanking residues) reinitiates translocation and spans the membrane in a type II topology. In contrast to AQP4, AQP1 fusion sites within the TM2–3 peptide loop (residues Pro77 and Arg93) were directed into a protease-protected environment (Fig. 2 C, lanes 4–9). Both uncleaved as well as signal peptidase-cleaved nascent chains remained protected from PK digestion, indicating that AQP1-TM2 failed to terminate translocation. Moreover, following the synthesis of TM3, residues Val107 and Leu139both remained accessible to protease, indicating that TM3 spanned the membrane with its N terminus in the ER lumen and C terminus in the cytosol (Fig. 2 C, lanes 10–15). Thus as AQP1 topogenic determinants emerge from the ribosome, they direct the nascent chain into a very different transmembrane orientation than corresponding determinants encoded within AQP4. Rather than spanning the membrane in a type I topology, AQP1-TM2 passes into the ER lumen. AQP1-TM3 then terminates translocation and initially spans the membrane in a type I topology (see diagrams in Fig. 2, B andC). Previous studies of AQP1 and AQP4 have demonstrated no difference in the cotranslational topology of peptide loops C-terminal to TMs 4, 5, and 6 (19Skach W. Shi L.-B. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V. Verkman A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Shi L.-B. Skach W. Ma T. Verkman A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8250-8256Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that topogenic information responsible for different translocation events should reside within TM1-TM3. To test this hypothesis, a series of chimeric proteins was generated by systematically exchanging AQP1 and AQP4 TM segments and their flanking residues (diagrammed in Fig. 1). Each chimera was then truncated and fused to the P reporter, and topology at each fusion site was determined by protease protection. Replacing AQP1-TM1 with corresponding residues from AQP4 produced no detectable change in AQP1 topology (Fig.3 A). Residues C-terminal to TM2 (Pro77), were translocated into the ER lumen, and residues Val107 and Leu139 were directed toward the cytosol. The latter two constructs generated a 16-kDa protease-protected fragment (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5 and 8, downward arrows) that was derived from the N terminus of AQP1 and contained TM1, TM2, and TM3 as described previously (19Skach W. Shi L.-B. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V. Verkman A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Similar fragments were also observed in Fig. 2 C upon longer exposure and did not contain the P reporter (data not shown). Exchanging the N terminus through the first extracellular loop (ECL1) of AQP1 also did not alter AQP1 topology, although signal peptidase cleaved at two different sites in the Pro77 truncations (Fig. 3 B). When the N terminus of AQP1 through TM2 was exchanged, the Pro77fusion site became accessible to protease, indicating that TM2 terminated translocation and its C-terminal residues were oriented toward the cytosol (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1–3). Surprisingly, however, this did not enable AQP1-TM3 to achieve its proper type II topology. Fusion sites N-terminal and C-terminal to TM3 all remained accessible to protease (<20% protection of the P reporter; Fig. 3 C, lanes 4–9). We next tested the reciprocal effects of replacing AQP4 residues with corresponding residu"

The effects of dexamethasone on rBSC1 were also studied in vitro using isolated rat MTAL segments. Cotransport activity was estimated by intracellular pH measurements; rBSC1 protein was quantified in MTAL crude membranes by immunoblotting analysis, and mRNA was quantified by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The abundance of rBSC1 protein and mRNA increased in ADX rats infused with dexamethasone compared with ADX rats (p < 0.04). In addition, application of dexamethasone for 1–3 h to MTALs caused rBSC1 protein and mRNA abundance and cotransport activity to significantly increase in a hyperosmotic medium (450 mosmol/kg of H2O) containing 0.7 nmarginine vasopressin, which is an in vitro experimental condition that resembles the in vivo MTAL environment. Results obtained in various media and with 8-bromo-cAMP indicated that stimulation of rBSC1 expression by glucocorticoids required interactions between glucocorticoid receptor- and cAMP-dependent factors. Up to 100 nm d-aldosterone had no effect on cotransport activityin vitro. Thus glucocorticoids directly stimulate MTAL rBSC1 expression and activity, which contributes to glucocorticoid-dependent effects on the renal regulation of acid-base balance and urinary concentrating ability.

NaCl and ammonia absorption without water by the medullary TAL (MTAL) causes transepithelial concentration differences of these solutes, which constitutes the “single effects” responsible for NaCl and ammonia accumulation in the renal medulla. This is critical both to the level of renal medullary hyperosmolality and thus to the urinary concentrating ability of the kidney and to urinary ammonia excretion and thus to the renal regulation of acid-base balance (1Knepper M.A. Burg M.

However, the stimuli and cellular mechanisms of these adaptations of rBSC1 expression were not specified in the latter in vivo studies. The presence of specific glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in the MTAL has been demonstrated by binding, immunological, and mRNA detection methods (14Farman N. Vandewalle A. Bonvalet J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: F325-F334PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kurt Lee S.-M. Chekal M.A. Katz A.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: F504-F509PubMed Google Scholar, 16Farman N. Oblin M.E. Lombes M. Delahaye F.

A number of studies have suggested that in vivo glucocorticoid administration acts on the MTAL, but little is known about the direct effects of glucocorticoids on the functions of this nephron segment. Dexamethasone has been shown to stimulate within a few hours the Na+/K+-ATPase activity of MTALs incubated in vitro (18Doucet A. Hus-Citharel A. Morel F. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: F851-F857PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rayson B.M. Lowther S.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: F656-F662PubMed Google Scholar). It must be pointed out that glucocorticoids have long been known to contribute to renal urinary concentrating ability through (at least in part) maintenance of medullary hyperosmolality (20Cooke R.C. Steenburg R.W. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1973; 82: 784-792PubMed Google Scholar) and to the increased urinary excretion of NH4+ in response to metabolic acidosis (21Kinsella J. Cujdik T. Sacktor B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and that both processes are greatly dependent on Na+-K+(NH4+)-2Cl−cotransport activity in the MTAL, as pointed out above. These considerations prompted us to design the present study to assess whether glucocorticoids affect rBSC1 expression in the MTAL. To this end we have measured the effects of a 1–3 h in vitroapplication of glucocorticoids on rBSC1 transport activity and protein and mRNA abundance. We have also determined the abundance of rBSC1 protein and mRNA after in vivo glucocorticoid administration. The results show that rBSC1 expression in the MTAL is up-regulated by glucocorticoids through interactions between GR- and cAMP-dependent pathways. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250–300 g were allowed free access to standard rat chow and drinking solution up to the time of the experiments. Rats were adrenalectomized (ADX) under light ether anesthetization and given 0.9% NaCl in distilled water as drinking solution during 6 days before the experiments. Some ADX rats were administered dexamethasone at 1.2 μg/100 g of body weight/day, a dose that is known to restore normal glucocorticoid activity, delivered by continuous infusion through subcutaneously implanted Alzet micro-osmotic pumps (Alza Corporation, Palo Alto, CA) during 6 days (ADX + Dexa); these ADX + Dexa rats also drank 0.9% NaCl in distilled water. Control rats from the same shipments were sham operated and drank normal water or 0.9% NaCl as drinking solution. After anesthetization by sodium pentobarbital, the kidneys were rapidly removed and cut into thin slices along the corticopapillary axis, and under a dissecting microscope the inner stripe of outer medulla of each slice was excised and cut into uniform small pieces, which were used for immunoblotting of membrane proteins and mRNA determinations. The method used to isolate MTAL fragments in suspension has been previously described (22Attmane-Elakeb A. Boulanger H. Vernimmen C. Bichara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25668-25677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have established by light and electron microscopy that this suspension was made almost exclusively of MTALs (≥95%), occasional thin limbs, and rare outer medullary collecting tubules, with no isolated cells or proximal tubules (12Attmane-Elakeb A.

MTAL suspensions were prepared from ADX rats that were given 0.9% NaCl in drinking distilled water for 6 days. Samples destined for rBSC1 protein and mRNA quantification were incubated for 2 h in the presence of dexamethasone as the glucocorticoid hormone or vehicle. Samples destined for measurement of intracellular pH (pHi) to estimate the Na+-K+(NH4+)-2Cl−cotransport activity were loaded with 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester, and measurements of Na+-K+(NH4+)-2Cl−cotransport activity were performed, as described previously (12Attmane-Elakeb A.

In brief, samples of 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester-loaded MTALs, preincubated in solution A or C (Table I), were diluted in the fluorometer cuvette in 2 ml of solution B or D (Table I), and pHi was monitored at 37 °C; then Na+-K+(NH4+)-2Cl−cotransport activity was assessed by determining the bumetanide-sensitive component of the cell acidification caused by abrupt exposure to 4 mm NH4Cl in the presence of 10 mm barium and 1 μm amiloride to block NH4+ carriers other than Na+-K+(NH4+)-2Cl−cotransport (12Attmane-Elakeb A.

We have previously demonstrated that the initial rate of NH4+-induced cell acidification (dpHi/dt, calculated as described previously (24Amlal H. LeGoff C. Vernimmen C. Paillard M. Bichara M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C455-C463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) is not significantly affected by changes in the activities of pHi regulatory mechanisms such as Na+/H+ antiport (24Amlal H. LeGoff C. Vernimmen C. Paillard M. Bichara M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C455-C463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have determined in the present study, by a previously described method (23Attmane-Elakeb A. Sibella V. Moreau A. Vernimmen C. Feldmann G. Paillard M. Bichara M.

Thus the initial rate of NH4+-induced cell acidification in the presence of 10 mm barium and 1 μm amiloride will be hereafter referred to as Na+-K+(NH4+)-2Cl−cotransport activity.Table IComposition of experimental solutionsABCDUrea5050NaCl125125175175KCl3333Choline-Cl1515BaCl21010K2HPO40.80.80.80.8KH2PO40.20.20.20.2MgCl21111CaCl21111Hepes10101010Values are in mm and represent final concentrations.

Crude membranes from the inner stripe of outer medulla or from MTAL suspensions were prepared for immunoblotting studies in the following way. Tissues were homogenized in a medium composed of 125 mm sucrose, 12 mm Trizma (Tris base) (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. These homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min in a Beckman GS-6KR centrifuge with a GH-3.7 rotor, and the supernatants were further centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 60 min in a Beckmanl-70 Ultracentrifuge with a 70 TI rotor. The membrane pellets were suspended in the above medium and stored at −80 °C until use. Semiquantification of membrane protein amounts was performed as described previously (12Attmane-Elakeb A.

In brief, the membranes were solubilized at ambient temperature for 20 min in Laemmli medium containing (final concentrations) 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed with solubilized membranes (15–25 μg of protein) and prestained molecular weight markers (Sigma) on 7.5% polyacrylamide minigels (Mini Protean II, Bio-Rad). Protein was subsequently transferred electrophoretically from the gels to nitrocellulose membranes (Mini Trans Blot Module, Bio-Rad). Equal loading and transfer efficiency were systematically checked by Ponceau red staining of the nitrocellulose membranes.

Quantification of β-actin was used as an additional control to check equal loading and transfer efficiency in the nitrocellulose membranes. Total RNA (RNAtot) was extracted from aliquots of the inner stripe of outer medulla or from MTAL suspensions with use of the SV total RNA isolation system kit (Promega). A competitor RNA that differed from the wild rBSC1 mRNA by a 116-base deletion of the latter was obtained, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed exactly as described previously in detail (12Attmane-Elakeb A.

Amounts of rBSC1 mRNA are expressed in amol per 100 ng of RNAtot. Note that both the rBSC1 protein and mRNA determination methods employed in the present work were designed to detect determinants common to the published rBSC1 isoforms that take place in the rat MTAL (12Attmane-Elakeb A.

Taq DNA polymerase, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and dNTP were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.; yeast transfer RNA and collagenaseClostridium histolyticum grade II were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; and 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Arginine vasopressin, dexamethasone, d-aldosterone, 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, amiloride, bumetanide, 8-bromo-cAMP, and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-chimie S.A.R.L. (LaVerpillière, France). Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance between experimental groups was assessed by Student's paired or unpaired t test or by 1-way analysis of variance completed by a t test using the within-groups residual variance of the analysis of variance, as appropriate. There was no difference in the plasma concentrations of sodium and chloride between three control (145.7 ± 0.3 mm and 98 ± 1, respectively), three ADX (142.7 ± 1.5 and 97 ± 2, respectively), and three ADX + Dexa rats (145.3 ± 0.7 and 96 ± 2, respectively); as expected, the plasma potassium concentration was higher in ADX (5.1 ± 0.5 mm) and ADX + Dexa (5.0 ± 0.2 mm) than in control rats (4.4 ± 0.1 mm). As shown in Table II, the abundance of rBSC1 protein was lower in ADX than in control rats that drank normal water, which was of borderline significance (p < 0.06), or 0.9% NaCl (p < 0.009); however, there was no difference in rBSC1 mRNA abundance. It should be emphasized that, when compared with the normal condition in rats, adrenalectomy is a complex condition in which several factors may have had opposing effects on rBSC1 expression, as discussed below. Thus, in another experimental series, results obtained from 5 ADX rats were compared with those obtained from 5 ADX + Dexa rats. As shown in Fig.1, dexamethasone administration increased rBSC1 protein abundance in crude membranes of the inner stripe of outer medulla by ∼91% (191 ± 23 arbitrary units in ADX + Dexaversus 100 ± 10 arbitrary units in ADX;p < 0.002), whereas there was no change in the abundance of β-actin protein. The dexamethasone-induced increase in rBSC1 protein abundance was accompanied by an ∼43% increase in rBSC1 mRNA abundance (15.7 ± 2.0 amol/100 ng of RNAtotin ADX + Dexa versus 11.0 ± 0.7 amol/100 ng of RNAtot in ADX; p < 0.03) (Fig.2). These results establish that glucocorticoid administration enhances rBSC1 expression in the MTAL.Table IIQuantification of rBSC1 protein and mRNA abundance in the inner stripe of outer medulla of control and ADX ratsSeriesβ-Actin proteinrBSC1 proteinrBSC1 mRNAarbitrary unitsarbitrary unitsamol/100 ng of RNAtotI.

To assess wether glucocorticoids directly stimulate rBSC1 expression in the MTAL in vitro, tubule fragments were incubated in experimental media in the presence of 10 nm dexamethasone or vehicle. In an attempt to recreate the in vivo MTAL environment, we performedin vitro experiments using a moderately hyperosmotic medium (∼450 mosmol/kg of H2O obtained by adding 50 mm NaCl plus 50 mm urea to isoosmotic medium; solution C in Table I). In addition, this hyperosmotic medium contained 0.7 nm AVP or 0.5 mm 8-bromo-cAMP. Indeed, the MTAL is surrounded in vivo by the hyperosmotic interstitial medium of the inner stripe of outer medulla of the kidney and is submitted to tonic influences by cAMP-generating peptide hormones such as AVP, glucagon, and calcitonin (25Morel F. Chabardes D. Imbert-Teboul M. Le Bouffant F. Hus-Citharel A. Montégut M. Kidney Int. 1982; 21 (suppl.): 55-62Google Scholar). In the hyperosmotic medium containing 0.7 nm AVP, within 2 h of incubation dexamethasone increased the abundance of rBSC1 protein and mRNA. rBSC1 protein abundance increased from 100 ± 4 arbitrary units in control to 137 ± 12 arbitrary units (p < 0.02; Fig. 3), whereas rBSC1 mRNA abundance increased from 1.1 ± 0.6 amol/100 ng of RNAtot in control to 2.5 ± 0.5 amol/100 ng of RNAtot(p < 0.04; Fig. 3). There was no difference in β-actin protein abundance (100 ± 14 versus 95 ± 30 arbitrary units; n = 6 for both; NS). The increases in rBSC1 mRNA and protein were accompanied with stimulation of Na+-K+(NH4+)-2Cl−cotransport activity. Dexamethasone increased the cotransport activity by ∼25% (p < 0.04; Fig.4) within 1–3 h of incubation in the hyperosmotic medium containing 0.7 nm AVP. Stimulation of the cotransport activity by dexamethasone was also observed when 0.5 mm 8-bromo-cAMP was added in place of AVP in the hyperosmotic medium (the dpHi/dt was −0.86 ± 0.05 versus −0.66 ± 0.03 pH unit/min in controls;n = 18 and 20, respectively; p < 0.002). By contrast, dexamethasone had no effect on NH4+-induced dpHi/dtin the presence of 0.1 mm bumetanide, which blocks the Na+-K+(NH4+)-2Cl−cotransport activity (−1.20 ± 0.04 versus −1.17 ± 0.08 pH unit/min in controls; n = 6 and 7, respectively; NS). Furthermore, dexamethasone-induced stimulation of cotransport activity in the hyperosmotic medium containing AVP was abolished by 20 μm actinomycin D or 20 μmcycloheximide (Fig. 4), which are inhibitors of transcription and protein synthesis, respectively.Figure 4Effects of 10 nm Dexa on Na+-K+(NH 4 + )-2Cl−cotransport activity in MTALs after 1–3 h of incubation in hyperosmotic medium containing 0.7 nm AVP.

In the isoosmotic medium containing 0.7 nm AVP, dexamethasone again strongly increased both rBSC1 protein abundance from 100 ± 9 arbitrary units in control to 212 ± 18 arbitrary units (p < 0.0004; Fig.5) and mRNA abundance from 7.3 ± 0.4 amol/100 ng of RNAtot in control to 21.0 ± 3.4 amol/100 ng of RNAtot (p< 0.04; Fig. 5). There was no difference in β-actin protein abundance (100 ± 3 arbitrary units in controls versus107 ± 6 arbitrary units; n = 6 for both; NS). By contrast, in the AVP-free hyperosmotic medium, dexamethasone decreased rBSC1 protein abundance from 100 ± 1 arbitrary units in control to 62 ± 5 arbitrary units (p < 0.0001; Fig.6) but did not affect rBSC1 mRNA abundance (4.5 ± 1.0 amol/100 ng RNAtot in controlversus 4.5 ± 1.1 amol/100 ng RNAtot ; NS; Fig. 6). There was no difference in β-actin protein abundance (100 ± 4 arbitrary units in controls versus 96 ± 7 arbitrary units; n = 6 for both; NS). Finally, in the AVP-free isoosmotic medium, dexamethasone decreased the abundance of rBSC1 protein and mRNA in MTAL suspensions within 2 h. rBSC1 protein abundance decreased from 100 ± 4 arbitrary units in control to 74 ± 8 arbitrary units (p < 0.02; Fig. 7), whereas rBSC1 mRNA abundance decreased from 2.8 ± 0.3 amol/100 ng of RNAtot in control to 2.1 ± 0.4 amol/100 ng of RNAtot , which was of borderline significance (p < 0.06; Fig. 7). There was no difference in β-actin protein abundance (100 ± 8versus 80 ± 24 arbitrary units; n = 4 for both; NS). The decreases in rBSC1 mRNA and protein abundance were accompanied by inhibition of Na+-K+(NH4+)-2Cl−cotransport activity. Indeed, 10 nm dexamethasone decreased the cotransport activity by ∼27% within 1–3 h of incubation (p < 0.001; Fig. 8). Dexamethasone had no effect on NH4+-induced dpHi/dtin the presence of 0.1 mm bumetanide (−1.05 ± 0.06versus −1.09 ± 0.05 pH unit/min in controls;n = 12 for both; NS). Furthermore, dexamethasone-induced inhibition of cotransport activity in the isoosmotic medium was abolished by 20 μm actinomycin D or 20 μm cycloheximide (Fig. 8). Thus the stimulating effects of dexamethasone required the presence of AVP in both hyperosmotic and isoosmotic media.Figure 6Effects of 10 nm Dexa on the abundance of rBSC1 protein (arbitrary units) and mRNA (amol/100 ng of RNAtot ) in MTALs after 2 h of incubation in AVP-free hyperosmotic medium.

Dexamethasone had no effect on the cell-buffering capacity (76 ± 6 versus 80 ± 4 mmol of H+/pH unit/liter; NS) or on the cell volume (0.39 ± 0.01 versus0.39 ± 0.01 nl/mm of tubule length; NS); cell buffering capacity and cell volume were estimated exactly as described previously (24Amlal H. LeGoff C. Vernimmen C. Paillard M. Bichara M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C455-C463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also checked that, after up to 3 h of incubation, Na+-K+(NH4+)-2Cl−cotransport activity was inhibited by the hyperosmotic medium (from −0.59 ± 0.07 pH unit/min in the isoosmotic medium to −0.43 ± 0.04 pH unit/min; p < 0.05) and was stimulated by 0.5 mm 8-bromo-cAMP in the isoosmotic medium (from −0.62 ± 0.09 pH unit/min in controls to −0.95 ± 0.02 pH unit/min; p < 0.01). Finally, 10 and 100 nm d-aldosterone had no effect on the Na+-K+(NH4+)-2Cl−cotransport activity (Fig. 9). This study is the first, to our knowledge, in which possible effects of glucocorticoids on rBSC1 expression in the MTAL were assessed both in vivo and in vitro. Comparing the level of rBSC1 expression in ADX rats to that in normal rats to assess the effects of glucocorticoid deficiency can hardly be achieved satisfactorily because adrenalectomy is a complex condition with respect to rBSC1 expression. For example, adrenalectomy is associated with increased circulating AVP concentrations probably because of impaired cardiac function (26Boykin J. De Torrentè A. Erickson A. Robertson C. Schrier R.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 62: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and AVP administration and cardiac insufficiency, even with normal AVP levels, both have been shown to strongly stimulate rBSC1 expression in the MTAL (11Kim G.-H. Ecelbarger C.A. Mitchell C. Packer R.K. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F96-F103PubMed Google Scholar, 27Marumo R. Kaizuma S. Nogae S. Kanazawa M. Kimura T. Saito T. Ito S. Matsubara M. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 877-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, NaCl administration, which was used in ADX rats to minimize urinary NaCl losses, has also been shown to stimulate rBSC1 expression (9Ecelbarger C.A. Terris J. Hoyer J.R. Nielsen S. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F619-F628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With these issues in mind, we observed that the abundance of rBSC1 protein in ADX rats tended to be lower as compared with rats given normal water (p < 0.06) and was significantly lower as compared with rats given 0.9% NaCl as drinking solution, like ADX rats (p < 0.009); however, there was no significant difference in rBSC1 mRNA abundance in both experimental series. On the other hand, supplementing ADX rats with dexamethasone appears to be a better means of assessing the effects of glucocorticoids on rBSC1. Glucocorticoid administration to ADX rats strongly stimulated rBSC1 mRNA and protein expression in the MTAL as compared with ADX rats. Thus these results establish that glucocorticoids enhance rBSC1 expression when administered in vivo. Furthermore, when dexamethasone was directly applied to MTALs in vitro, rBSC1 mRNA and protein expression and cotransport activity were stimulated in a hyperosmotic medium containing AVP, an experimental condition that resembles the natural MTAL environment. Strong stimulation of rBSC1 expression by dexamethasone was observed in an AVP-containing isoosmotic medium as well, and a glucocorticoid-induced increase in Na+-K+(NH4+)-2Cl−cotransport activity also occurred when 8-bromo-cAMP was used in place of AVP in a hyperosmotic medium. The stimulating effects of dexamethasone were not seen in AVP- and cAMP-free media. Thus it is clear that stimulation of rBSC1 expression by dexamethasone required interactions with cAMP-dependent factors. Because several peptide hormones such as AVP, calcitonin, and glucagon stimulate the MTAL adenylyl cyclase, it is very likely that MTAL cells in vivo are chronically subjected to the influences of cAMP-generating peptide hormones (25Morel F. Chabardes D. Imbert-Teboul M. Le Bouffant F. Hus-Citharel A. Montégut M. Kidney Int. 1982; 21 (suppl.): 55-62Google Scholar). The in vitro effects of dexamethasone on cotransport activity were abolished by actinomycin D or cycloheximide and were not observed with d-aldosterone. This indicates that GR activation and attendant effects on gene transcription and translation were responsible for the changes in rBSC1 expression and activity. The present finding that glucocorticoids physiologically stimulate rBSC1 expression and activity would be consistent with the observations that dexamethasone also stimulates Na+/K+-ATPase activity in the MTAL (18Doucet A. Hus-Citharel A. Morel F. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: F851-F857PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rayson B.M. Lowther S.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: F656-F662PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these effects would provide the mechanism for glucocorticoid-dependent stimulation of NaCl and NH4+ transport by the TAL. The intracellular mechanisms by which glucocorticoids exerted their effects in the MTAL were not investigated in the present study. As mentioned above, GR activation in vitro appears to be able to stimulate as well as to inhibit rBSC1 expression and activity depending on the presence or absence of cAMP. The results obtained in the various experimental media suggest that several interactions between GR activation and osmolality- and cAMP-dependent factors take place in the MTAL to physiologically enhance rBSC1 expression. Thus a number of intracellular events, such as altered rBSC1 gene transcription, mRNA decay, translation efficiency, and membrane trafficking of rBSC1 protein, may have combined to explain our results. Regulation of accessory protein expression may also have occurred. It is well known that the GR can interact with several other proteins through protein-protein interactions or with transcription factors at the level of the promoters of regulated genes, which may be controlled by cAMP. In particular, glucocorticoid-induced GR activation was shown, through interactions with the transcription factor AP1 at the level of a composite glucocorticoid response element named plfG, to activate or inhibit transcription depending on the c-Jun-c-Jun or c-Jun-c-Fos composition of AP1 (28Pearce D.

Thus the present results establish that in vivoglucocorticoid administration as well as in vitroglucocorticoid application to freshly harvested MTALs in media containing AVP stimulates rBSC1 expression in rat MTAL, as manifested by an increase in rBSC1 mRNA, protein, and transport activity, which required interactions with cAMP-dependent pathways. Because the Na+-K+(NH4+)-2Cl−cotransporter is a major MTAL apical NaCl and NH4+ carrier, these observations contribute to explain the role of glucocorticoids in the ability of the kidney to concentrate the urine (20Cooke R.C. Steenburg R.W. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1973; 82: 784-792PubMed Google Scholar) and in the adaptive increase in urinary NH4+ excretion in response to metabolic acidosis (21Kinsella J. Cujdik T. Sacktor B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). With respect to urinary NH4+ excretion, a glucocorticoid-induced increase in MTAL ammonia absorption would be complementary to the known stimulating effect of glucocorticoids on ammonia production by the proximal tubule (29Welbourne T.C. Givens G. Joshi S. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: F134-F138PubMed Google Scholar). It must be emphasized that we have recently established that rBSC1 expression in the MTAL is enhanced during chronic metabolic acidosis (12Attmane-Elakeb A. Mount D.B. Sibella V. Vernimmen C. Hebert S.C. Bichara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33681-33691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and that adrenal glucocorticoid production is known to increase in response to acid loading (30Welbourne T.C. Endocrinology. 1976; 99: 762-767Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Perez G.O. Oster J.R. Katz F.H. Vaamonde C.A. Horm. Res. (Basel). 1979; 11: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32May R.C. Kelly R.A. Mitch W.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). This suggests that glucocorticoids act in both the proximal tubule and MTAL to increase urinary NH4+ excretion in response to metabolic acidosis. In addition, we have also shown thatin vitro incubation of MTALs in an acid medium enhances rBSC1 mRNA and protein abundance and cotransport activity (12Attmane-Elakeb A. Mount D.B. Sibella V. Vernimmen C. Hebert S.C. Bichara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33681-33691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus the direct effects of an acid pH and of glucocorticoids would add to fully explain the stimulation of rBSC1 expression in the MTAL by metabolic acidosis (Ref. 12Attmane-Elakeb A. Mount D.B.

Further work is needed to test this hypothesis. Otherwise, it is worth noting that, if glucocorticoids stimulate rBSC1 expression in the cortical TAL also, sodium chloride absorption without water should be enhanced along the entire TAL, which would contribute to explaining the permissive role of glucocorticoids in the renal elimination of a water load (33McDonald K.M. Miller P.D. Anderson R.J. Berl T. Schrier R.W. Kidney Int. 1976; 10: 38-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The effects of glucocorticoids on rBSC1 described in the present study may thus explain, at least in part, the well known inability of the kidney to maximally concentrate or dilute the urine during adrenal insufficiency. We thank David B. Mount for providing us with the rBSC1 affinity-purified antibody and the original rBSC1 cDNA plasmid."

Lipolytic inhibition is associated with a differential ability of the lipoproteins to remove HL from the HSPG. LDL and VLDL are unable to displace HL, whereas HDL readily displaces HL from the HSPG.

Both apoA-I and HDL are able to inhibit VLDL lipid hydrolysis by up to 60%. Inhibition of VLDL hydrolysis is associated with the binding of apoA-I to the surface of the VLDL particle and a concomitant decreased affinity for HL.

The enzyme is found anchored by heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) to the surface of endothelial cells and hepatocytes (2Sanan D.A. Fan J. Bensadoun A. Taylor J.M. J.

The catalytic function of HL involves the hydrolysis of sn-1 fatty acyl ester bonds of phospholipids (PL) and mono-, di-, and triglycerides (TG) found in all classes of lipoproteins (8Waite M.

It is believed that HL is involved in the remodeling of high density lipoprotein (HDL) and in the hydrolysis of the intermediate density lipoprotein to form LDL (12Musliner T.A. Herbert P.N. Kingston M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 575: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). HSPG are composed of two main components: a protein core and sulfated polysaccharide side chains known as glycosaminoglycans. The protein core functions to anchor the molecule to the cell surface and to covalently bind glycosaminoglycans. HSPG are present in most tissues and can be located within the cell as well as on the pericellular and extracellular matrices (13Gressner A.M. Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1991; 29: 293-311PubMed Google Scholar). Studies have suggested that interactions with HSPG may affect the catalytic activity of lipolytic enzymes. Waiteet al. (8Waite M. Sisson P. El-Maghrabi R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 530: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) identified changes in the substrate specificity of HL after it was released from the liver by heparin. In addition, studies with lipoprotein lipase (LPL) have suggested that the binding of this enzyme to HSPG may inhibit its catalytic activity (14Posner I. Wang C.S. McConathy W.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 226: 306-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Clark A.B. Quarfordt S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4778-4783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, most HL is thought to be associated with cell surface HSPG, therefore experiments were undertaken to determine how the association of HL with HSPG may affect the function of this enzyme. We show that lipid hydrolysis by HL is inhibited when the enzyme is associated with HSPG. This study further shows that apolipoprotein (apo) A-I has the ability to displace HL from HSPG and also to inhibit the hydrolysis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) lipids by this enzyme. HSPG were purchased from Sigma. The free fatty acid diagnostic kits were purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Laval, Quebec (PQ), Canada). The anti-mouse IgG, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked whole antibody (isolated from sheep) and the broad range molecular weight markers were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Baie d'Urfé, PQ, Canada). The SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate was purchased from Pierce. The anti-HL monoclonal antibody (mAb) (3Ji Z.S. Dichek H.L. Miranda R.D. Mahley R.W. J. Biol.

Y. Marcel and R. Milne. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Plasma from fasting, normolipidemic subjects was collected and VLDL, LDL, and HDL were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation within the density rangesd < 1.006, d = 1.019–1.063, andd = 1.063–1.21 g/ml, respectively. The protein content of the lipoprotein fractions was determined by the Lowry method as modified by Markwell et al. (16Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5319) Google Scholar). PL, cholesterol, and TG contents were determined enzymatically using diagnostic kits (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, PQ, Canada). HL was purified from post-heparin human plasma by heparin affinity chromatography as described by Ehnholm et al. (17Ehnholm C. Kuusi T. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 716-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Post-heparin human plasma was collected from normolipidemic subjects and a 20% TG emulsion (Intralipid 20%, Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc., Missassauga, Ontario, Canada) was added to the plasma. Lipid cakes were harvested centrifugally and delipidated. The resuspended, aqueous solution of crude HL was loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column and eluted with a linear salt gradient of 0.15–1.5 m NaCl in 5 mm sodium barbital, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol and the pooled fractions stored at −80 °C until use. HL activity was characterized using a TG emulsion and quantitated into units of enzyme activity (where 1 unit = 1 μmol of fatty acid hydrolyzed/h). The protein concentration of the purified HL was 0.114 mg/ml, and the specific activity of the isolated HL was determined to be 19,455 units/mg of protein. The isolated HL was further characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting using the anti-HL mAb. A single band with an apparent molecular mass of 66 kDa was evident. The binding of human HL to HSPG was investigated in assays performed in 96-well Removawell plates. Removawells were incubated with 5 μg of pure HSPG for 2 h at room temperature, washed three times with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl (PBS) and blocked with PBS containing 1% essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (FAF-BSA) overnight at 4 °C. The Removawells were again washed three times with PBS and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with HL (120 units) in PBS (final volume, 125 μl). After incubation, Removawells were washed once with PBS to remove any unbound HL. Native lipoproteins were characterized as substrates for purified HL bound to HSPG (as described above) or free in solution. Each Removawell contained the lipoprotein substrate, 26 units of purified HL, 75 μl of incubation buffer (0.33 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1% FAF-BSA, 5 mm CaCl2), and PBS (final volume, 250 μl) in the presence or absence of HSPG. Incubations were carried out for 30 min (inhibition studies) or 3 h at 37 °C and terminated by placing the plate on ice. The total amount of fatty acid released during the incubation was determined using a free fatty acid diagnostic kit. HSPG-bound HL was incubated for 3 h with the lipoprotein substrates, and then Removawells were rinsed with PBS. 60 μl of an elution buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.5% (w/v) bromphenol blue) was added to the Removawells, to elute the HSPG-bound HL, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples were electrophoresed on a 12% acrylamide gel, under denaturing conditions, and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was cut at the 35-kDa marker, and the upper portion of the nitrocellulose was blocked overnight at 4 °C in blocking solution A (PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.2% Tween 20). After a 2-h incubation at room temperature with the anti-HL mAb (3:5000 dilution) in blocking solution A containing 0.02% sodium azide, the membranes were rinsed three times and washed four times for 15 min each with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 (PBS-Tween). Sheep anti-mouse IgG, HRP-linked whole antibody was used as a secondary antibody and diluted (1:5000) in blocking solution A. After a 1-h incubation, the membranes were rinsed three times and washed four times for 15 min each with PBS-Tween. A 10-min incubation with the Pierce Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate was used to visualize the HL. The membranes were exposed to film for various times and scanned, and the percentage of HL that remained bound to the HSPG under the various conditions was determined by densitometry using Bio-Rad Quantity One (version 4.03) software. After the samples were electrophoresed and transferred and the nitrocellulose membrane cut, the lower portion of the nitrocellulose was blocked overnight at 4 °C in blocking solution B (PBS containing 5% skim milk and 0.2% Tween 20). After a 1-h incubation at room temperature with the anti-apoA-I mAbs 5F6 and 4H1 (1:5000 dilution each) in blocking solution B containing 0.02% sodium azide, the membranes were rinsed and washed three times for 10 min with PBS-Tween. Sheep anti-mouse IgG, HRP-linked whole antibody was used as a secondary antibody and diluted (1:5000) in blocking solution B. After a 1-h incubation, the membranes were washed three times with PBS-Tween. The apoA-I that bound to the HSPG was visualized, scanned, and analyzed as described for HL. Similar protocols were used to evaluate the binding of apoB (mAb 1D1) and apoE (mAb 1D7) to HSPG. Removawells were coated with an anti-apoB mAb (1D1) (at a predetermined dilution) overnight at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and saturated with 0.5% gelatin in PBS. Serial dilutions of VLDL ± HDL or apoA-I (in PBS with 0.1% gelatin), that had been incubated with HL for 3 h at 37 °C, were incubated with the previously coated Removawells for 2 h at room temperature. After 3 washes (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20), the Removawells were incubated for 1 h with125I-labeled anti-apoA-I mAbs (4H1 and 5F6) in PBS with 0.1% gelatin (∼200,000 cpm/0.015 μg/well). Wells were washed three times with PBS-Tween, and their radioactivity was measured. Removawells were coated with pure HSPG (5 μg/Removawell), incubated with FAF-BSA to block any nonspecific binding of HL, and incubated with excess purified human HL (120 units) for 2 h. Control incubations showed that negligible amounts of HL bound to albumin or albumin treated plates. Unbound HL was removed by washing, and 60 μl of elution buffer was added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to elute the HSPG-bound HL. SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis using an anti-HL mAb was performed to estimate the amount of HL bound. Maximal binding was shown to occur within 2 h, and ∼26 units of HL was shown to associate with 5 μg of HSPG. All subsequent experiments were therefore carried out with a 2-h association of HL with HSPG, followed by a brief wash to remove excess unbound HL. To evaluate whether the association of HL to HSPG alters the catalytic activity of the enzyme, Removawells were coated with HSPG, blocked with FAF-BSA, incubated with excess HL for 2 h, and washed. VLDL, LDL, or HDL (350 μm TG) were added to the wells and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Extended incubation times (3 h) and high substrate (TG) concentrations were required to promote enough hydrolysis to allow for comparison of hydrolytic rates for the best (VLDL and LDL) and poorer (HDL) HL substrates (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 shows that the association of HL with HSPG has a significant inhibitory affect on VLDL and LDL lipid hydrolysis, as compared with the control (BSA-blocked) Removawell that contained 26 units of HL, but no HSPG. In contrast, when HDL was evaluated as a substrate for HL, in the presence and absence of HSPG, the difference in total hydrolytic activity of the enzyme was much less (Fig. 1). Association of HL with HSPG inhibited LDL and VLDL hydrolysis by >80%, but inhibited HDL hydrolysis by ∼40%. To investigate whether the various lipoproteins affected the binding/association of HL with the HSPG, Removawells were coated with HSPG, blocked with FAF-BSA, incubated with excess HL for 2 h, washed, and incubated with different lipoproteins. After a standard 3-h incubation, the supernatant was removed and the Removawells were washed with PBS. Elution buffer was added, and the eluants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-HL mAb. The amount of HL that remained bound to HSPG after a 3-h incubation with VLDL, LDL, and HDL was estimated, relative to a control Removawell incubated with PBS. Fig.2 (upper panel) shows that LDL and VLDL were almost unable to displace HL from pure HSPG. When either LDL or VLDL was incubated with HSPG-bound HL, >90% of the HL remained bound. In contrast, HDL readily displaced the HL; only ∼40% of the HL remained bound after a 3-h incubation. Displacement of HL was time-dependent; minimal displacement occurred by 30 min, and maximal displacement occurred by 3 h (data not shown). Experiments were also undertaken with lipoproteins from other subjects, and a substantive variation in displacement was evident. Some HDL preparations almost completely dissociated HL from HSPG and some VLDL caused slightly more displacement (5–10%) than that illustrated in Fig. 2.Figure 2Effect of lipoproteins on the association of hepatic lipase with HSPG. Removawells were coated with HSPG and HL (described in Fig. 1) and incubated with various plasma lipoproteins or PBS (control) for 3 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed, and the HSPG-bound proteins were eluted from the Removawells by incubating with 60 μl of elution buffer at 37 °C for 30 min. The eluants were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. Samples were probed with an anti-HL mAb (upper panel) or with anti-apoA-I mAbs (lower panel) and with an anti-mouse IgG HRP-linked secondary antibody. Apparent molecular weight determinations were derived from broad range molecular weight markers. Images are representative of triplicate determinations of two different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine if some apoprotein component of the different lipoproteins was able to displace HL by binding to the proteoglycan, the HSPG eluant was probed with mAbs to specific apoproteins. Although some apoB retention to the HSPG was identified with LDL and VLDL, as others have reported (18Pitas R.E. Boyles J.K. Lee S.H. Hui D. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14352-14360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Camejo G. Olofsson S.O. Lopez F. Carlsson P. Bondjers G. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 368-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Cardin A.D. Jackson R.L. Elledge B. Feldhake D. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1989; 11: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), no detectable amounts of apoE were found associated with the HSPG after incubation with any of the lipoproteins (data not shown). In contrast, large amounts of apoA-I were retained on the HSPG when HDL was incubated with the HSPG-bound HL (Fig. 2, lower panel). Small amounts of apoA-I were also detectable in incubations with LDL and VLDL, suggesting that some apoA-I may have been endogenously associated with these lower density lipoproteins. Fig. 3 illustrates an experiment that was undertaken to determine if HDL and pure, lipid-free apoA-I were equally effective at displacing HL from HSPG. When equal amounts of protein were incubated with HSPG-bound HL, apoA-I was shown to be able to promote ∼1.5 times the HL release, as compared with HDL (Fig. 3,upper panel). In addition, twice as much apoA-I was retained on the HSPG with incubations of the lipid free protein, as compared with HDL (Fig. 3, lower panel). ApoA-I titration experiments were then performed to assess the effect of apoA-I concentration on HL displacement from HSPG. The results showed that even very low concentrations of apoA-I (14 μg/ml) were able to promote a maximal displacement of HL and that a 10-fold increase in apoA-I concentration had no substantial effect on the liberation of HL from HSPG (data not shown). Since HL appeared inactive when bound to HSPG and apoA-I can liberate the enzyme, experiments were performed to determine if the liberation of HL from HSPG by apoA-I could stimulate the hydrolysis of VLDL. Incubations were performed with free and HSPG-bound HL as described in Fig. 1; however, in some wells, VLDL was co-incubated with either pure apoA-I or HDL. Although the displacement of HSPG-bound HL by heparin was shown to recover the activity of the enzyme, Fig.4 shows that addition of apoA-I or HDL to incubations of HSPG-bound HL and VLDL had little effect on the rate of lipid hydrolysis, relative to that expected for a displaced enzyme. Fig. 5 further shows that this “retained inhibition” was partly due to an impaired displacement of HL by either apoA-I or HDL, in the presence of VLDL. In this experiment, apoA-I and HDL were able to displace between 40% and 50% of the HSPG-bound HL. In the presence of VLDL, HL displacement fell to less than 10%. However, it is evident that, even though some HL displacement had occurred in these incubations, hydrolysis rates remained unaffected. These data suggest that apoA-I may have a secondary affect on HL-mediated hydrolysis.Figure 5Effect of VLDL on the dissociation of hepatic lipase by HDL and apoA-I. Removawells were coated with HSPG and HL as described and incubated with VLDL (350 μm TG), HDL (130 μm TG), apoA-I (equivalent HDL protein concentration), or VLDL plus HDL or apoA-I for 3 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed, and the HSPG-bound proteins were eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Samples were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with an anti-HL mAb. The histograms show the percentage of HL displaced from the HSPG (relative to the control PBS incubation) and were estimated from the Western blot shown. Values are representative of two different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether apoA-I or HDL could directly affect the hydrolysis of VLDL by HL, standard hydrolytic assays, in the absence of HSPG, were performed. Fig. 6 shows that increasing the concentration of apoA-I or HDL significantly inhibited the hydrolysis of VLDL, up to a maximum of 60%. Similar observations were made with LDL; both apoA-I and HDL can also directly inhibit the HL-mediated hydrolysis of LDL (data not shown). In addition, at the lower concentrations, apoA-I was up to 5 times more inhibitory to HL than HDL. This is also evident in Fig. 7, which shows HL hydrolytic rates as a function of VLDL concentrations, but at constant inhibitor concentration. The figure shows that 5 times more HDL is required to accomplish the equivalent inhibition as a given amount of apoA-I. The inset in Fig. 7 further shows that inhibition of HL is associated with an increase in the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (K m) values (inverse ofx intercept) and concomitant decrease in the maximum velocity (V max) of the enzyme. We (21Sparks D.L. Frank P.G. Neville T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1390: 160-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and others (22Bolin D.J. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7429-7434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have previously shown that this apparentK m for an interfacial enzyme, when represented as a protein concentration, indicates the amount of VLDL particles required for a half-maximal velocity and therefore reflects a measure of binding affinity. The data therefore suggest that apoA-I may inhibit HL by decreasing its binding affinity to VLDL.Figure 7Effect of apoA-I or HDL on the hydrolysis of VLDL by hepatic lipase. Various amounts of VLDL were incubated with HL (26 units) and a constant amount of HDL or apoA-I (as indicated) for 30 min at 37 °C. An aliquot was removed and fatty acid release was measured enzymatically. Hydrolytic values are the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations.

One way this could have occurred is if apoA-I was prevented from interacting with HSPG by instead binding directly to the VLDL. To determine if inhibition of HL may also be associated with the binding of apoA-I to VLDL, several experiments were performed to show the direct binding of apoA-I to VLDL. Fig. 8 illustrates an experiment demonstrating VLDL-apoA-I association by a solid phase radio-immunometric assay. Plates coated with a mAb to apoB (1D1) were incubated with VLDL that had been incubated (3 h) with HL ± HDL or apoA-I. ApoA-I association with the VLDL was then measured with a mixture of two 125I-labeled mAbs to apoA-I (4H1 and 5F6). Significant apoA-I immunoreactivity is evident with the VLDL that had been incubated with apoA-I or HDL, but not with the native VLDL (Fig.8). The omission of HL from these incubations had no affect on apoA-I association with VLDL (data not shown). Similar incubations with HL ± HDL or apoA-I were performed, and then VLDL was isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation and probed for apoA-I. These studies also showed significant association of apoA-I with VLDL particles (data not shown) and confirmed the view that significant amounts of apoA-I can become associated with VLDL. In addition, VLDL incubated with apoA-I or HDL also exhibited a reduced electrophoretic mobility on agarose gels (data not shown), which suggests that association of apoA-I with VLDL affects its electrostatic properties and reduces the net negative charge on this lipoprotein. To determine the physiological relevance of HL inhibition by HDL, experiments were performed to estimate the effect of HDL concentration in plasma on lipid hydrolysis by HL. Plasma lipoproteins from a fasting normolipidemic subject were isolated within the density rangesd < 1.063 g/ml and d = 1.063–1.25 g/ml and then recombined in various ratios. Mixtures contained the equivalent amount of apoB-containing lipoproteins, to the original plasma concentrations, and progressively increasing amounts of HDL, representing from 0% to 100% of the original amount of HDL. Unmodified plasma and lipoprotein mixtures were then incubated with a constant amount of purified HL for various times. Fig.9 shows that HL-mediated lipid hydrolysis in plasma is almost completely inhibited. Hydrolysis was maximal for the apoB-containing lipoproteins alone and was progressively inhibited by increasing amounts of HDL. The experiment shows that approximately 70% of the HL inhibition in plasma is likely due to HDL/apoA-I specific effects, but that some other components in plasma also have complementary inhibitory effects. The majority of plasma LDL is thought to be produced by HL through the hydrolysis of VLDL and intermediate density lipoprotein and the transfer/exchange of lipids and apoproteins with HDL (23Schaefer E.J.

Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 614-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of HL to promote the production of potentially atherogenic lipoprotein particles has led to the view that HL may increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis (25Weintraub M.S.

Acta. 1990; 1042: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This is consistent with observations from a number of laboratories that have identified an inverse relationship between HL activity and plasma HDL levels. Studies have shown that HDL2 levels in the plasma are inversely related to post-heparin plasma HL activity (27Kuusi T. Kinnunen P.K. Nikkila E.A.

Although several anti-atherogenic HDL functions have been proposed, some views have maintained that HDL levels are merely reflective of an efficient lipolytic system and, through this link, a marker for coronary artery disease risk (31Kirchmair R.

Recently, we have proposed a model in which the kinase activity is required for translocation of the DNA end-binding subunit Ku along the DNA helix when DNA-PK assembles on DNA ends. Here, we have questioned the consequences of Ku entry into DNA on local DNA processes by using human nuclear cell extracts incubated in the presence of linearized plasmid DNA. As two model processes, we have chosen nucleotide excision repair (NER) of UVC DNA lesions and transcription from viral promoters. We show that although NER efficiency is strongly reduced on linear DNA, it can be fully restored in the presence of DNA-PK inhibitors. Simultaneously, the amount of NER proteins bound to the UVC-damaged linear DNA is increased and the amount of Ku bound to the same DNA molecules is decreased. Similarly, the poor transcription efficiency exhibited by viral promoters on linear DNA is enhanced in the presence of DNA-PK inhibitor concentrations that prevent Ku entry into the DNA substrate molecule.

In response to the deleterious consequences associated with DSBs, highly efficient mechanisms have evolved for their recognition and repair. Mammalian cells appear to rejoin DSBs primarily by a mechanism of non-homologous recombination (reviewed in Refs. 2Karran P. Curr. Opin.

Insights into the proteins involved in DSBs repair have been gained from analysis of the molecular defects in mutant rodent cells that are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and unable to carry out the V(D)J recombination process in the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes. Recent evidence shows that a multiprotein complex, the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), plays a central role in DSBs repair in mammalian cells (reviewed in Refs. 6Featherstone C. Jackson S.P.

Cancer Surv. 1997; 29: 221-261PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA-PK is a heterotrimeric enzyme composed of a large catalytic subunit of ∼460 kDa (DNA PKcs, p460), a serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p110) family (9Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) and a dimeric regulatory component consisting of the Ku80 and Ku70 proteins (10Dvir A. Peterson S.R. Knuth M.W. Lu H.

Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Ku was originally identified as a heterodimeric autoantigen consisting of ∼80 and 70-kDa subunits (Ku80 and Ku70, respectively) (12Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10375-10379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It binds specifically to double-strand breaks and, more generally, to any transition from single- to double-strand DNA, without demonstrating sequence specificity (12Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10375-10379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Blier P.R. Griffith A.J. Craft J. Hardin J.A. J. Biol.

Ku is able to translocate along the DNA in an ATP-independent manner allowing several Ku dimers to bind to a single DNA molecule and form a multimeric complex (15De Vries E. van Driel W. Bergsma W.G. Arnberg A.C. van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 16Zhang W.W. Yaneva M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 186: 574-579Google Scholar). Ku has been found to constitute the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) activating subunit since, once bound to DNA, it recruits and activates the p460 catalytic subunit (10Dvir A. Peterson S.R. Knuth M.W. Lu H. Dynan W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11920-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 11Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Although the DNA-binding properties of Ku protein have been well characterized with purified native or recombinant proteins, the question of the influence of the catalytic subunit on Ku interaction with DNA was poorly documented. We have shown recently by assessing Ku DNA end binding activity in human nuclear cell extracts by electrophoretic mobility shift assays that DNA-PK, including Ku and p460, is blocked at DNA ends in the presence of a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor such as wortmannin and prevents end processing by either DNA polymerization, degradation, or ligation. On the opposite, the kinase activity is required for Ku translocation along the DNA helix when the whole Ku-DNA-PKcs complex assembles on DNA ends (17Calsou P. Frit P. Humbert O. Muller C. Chen D.J. Salles B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7848-7856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The question of the function of Ku entry into the DNA helix is still open. For example, it is known that Ku rigidifies the DNA structure (18Calsou P. Frit P. Salles B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27601-27607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), is able to form a DNA loop by contact of distant Ku dimers (19Cary R.B. Peterson S.R. Wang J.T. Bear D.G. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4267-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and to transfer from one DNA molecule to another (20Bliss T.M. Lane D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5765-5773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Alternatively, multiple Ku proteins bound to a single dsDNA may serve the recruitment of additional proteins. Thus, the spreading of several Ku dimers possibly integrated in multiprotein complexes bound to DNA around the breaks may have various consequences on local DNA processes like replication or transcription. Here, we have addressed this question by using human nuclear cell extracts incubated in the presence of linearized plasmid DNA. As two model processes, we have chosen nucleotide excision repair (NER) of UVC DNA lesions and transcription from viral promoters. NER is the major DNA repair pathway for numerous DNA lesions including UVC photoproducts (for review see Refs. 21de Laat W.L. Jaspers N. Hoeijmakers J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 768-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 22Batty D.P. Wood R.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 241: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 23de Boer J. Hoeijmakers J. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The reaction is carried out by the coordinated action of about 30 proteins that are involved in the two main steps, recognition/incision-excision of the lesion and DNA synthesis/ligation to restore strand continuity. The human cell lines of complementation group A to G representative of the cancer-prone disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) exhibit a deficiency in the early steps of the reaction. We have previously shown that the incision activity exhibited by human cell extracts in vitro was decreased by about 80% on a linear damaged plasmid DNA when compared with the efficiency on a supercoiled plasmid DNA substrate (18Calsou P. Frit P. Salles B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27601-27607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). By using an assay allowing us to monitor directly the interactions of proteins with damaged DNA (24Li R.-Y. Calsou P. Jones C.J. Salles B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we have shown a dramatic inhibition of the binding of key NER proteins to linear damaged DNA. NER efficiency and NER proteins binding to damaged DNA were concomitantly regained when the reaction was performed with extracts lacking Ku activity, whereas addition of purified human Ku complex to these extracts restored the inhibition (25Frit P. Calsou P. Chen D.J. Salles B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Here, we show that NER efficiency can be fully restored in the presence of DNA-PK inhibitors. This restoration is accompanied by an increased binding of NER proteins to the UVC-damaged linear DNA and by a mirror decreased binding of Ku heterodimer. Similarly, the poor transcription efficiency exhibited by viral promoters on linear DNA is enhanced in the presence of wortmannin concentrations that prevent Ku entry into the DNA substrate molecule. The present results support a model in which DNA-PK catalytic activity can regulate DNA transactions in the vicinity of double-strand breaks by controlling Ku entry into DNA. The HeLa S3 cell line was obtained from the stock of European Molecular Biology Laboratories (Heidelberg, Germany). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 125 units/ml penicillin, and 125 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from HeLa cells as described previously (26Shapiro D.J. DNA (New York). 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) except that the final dialysis was performed for 3 h at 4 °C in 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 17% glycerol, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. After preparation, extracts were immediately frozen and stored at −80 °C. After cell lysis and centrifugation to pellet the nuclei, the supernatant was removed, extracted in parallel, and dialyzed in the same buffer as the nuclear extracts. It was designed thereafter as cytoplasmic extracts. After preparation, extracts were immediately frozen and stored at −80 °C. The purified Ku complex and the p460 DNA-PK catalytic subunit were generous gifts of Dr. D. J. Chen (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA). Ku heterodimer was baculoviral expressed recombinant proteins, and p460 was purified from HeLa cells, as described previously (19Cary R.B. Peterson S.R. Wang J.T. Bear D.G. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J.

Closed circular 2959-bp pBluescript KS+ (pBS, Stratagene) and the related 3738-bp pHM14 plasmid (gift from Dr. R. D. Wood, ICRF, Herts EN6 3LD, UK) were prepared by the standard alkaline lysis method and cesium chloride gradient centrifugation from Escherichia coli JM109 (relevant genotype: recA1, endA1, gyrA96, hsdR17) followed by two neutral sucrose gradient centrifugations as described (27Biggerstaff M. Robins P. Coverley D. Wood R.D. Mutat.

Robins P. Lindahl T. Cell. 1988; 53: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Plasmids used in transcription assays were kind gifts of Dr. M. S. Satoh, (Université Laval, Quebec, Canada). Downstream from a strong viral promoter, they contained a G-less cassette that does not have any guanine residue in the non-transcribed strand (29Sawadogo M. Roeder R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). pGf1 contained the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP), and pΔGf1 was prepared from pGf1 plasmid by removing AdMLP (30Satoh M.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3576-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). pCMV contained the cytomegalovirus promoter. The sequence of the non-transcribed strand of the G-less cassette is as follows: 5′-TCCTCACTCTCTTCCTCTTAATTAACCCCTACCCTCCCACCACACCTCTTAACTAATATTAACTCACTCCCCTACCCCATACACCACTCTACCTCACCCCATCAACCTTAA-3′, where the +1 start site for transcription is shown in boldface and the last 3′ dinucleotide belongs to a HindIII restriction site. Supercoiled plasmids were prepared as described above. When necessary, damaged and undamaged plasmids were linearized by digestion with restriction enzyme as mentioned, and a reaction without enzyme was performed in parallel. The resulting plasmids were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol-precipitated. In the presence of restriction enzyme, the linearization was complete as judged by eye after migration on agarose gel. The linearized plasmid was designed thereafter as linear DNA (L), and the product of the control reaction without enzyme was named supercoiled or circular plasmid (C). Repair synthesis assay was performed essentially as described previously (24Li R.-Y. Calsou P. Jones C.J. Salles B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 ng of damaged or untreated plasmid DNA closed-circular or linear were adsorbed on sensitized 96-well microtiter plates (Microlite II, Dynatech) in 10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7, for 30 min at 30 °C with shaking. No significant difference in DNA adsorption was found between linearversus circular or damaged versus undamaged DNA, as quantified with fluorescence detection (picoGreen dye, Molecular Probes) or with radiolabeled DNA. The standard repair reaction was carried out in 50 μl (final volume/per well) and contained typically 150 μg of protein extract in reaction buffer (70 mm KCl (or 70 mm KGlu), 40 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 7 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 2.5 μg of creatine phosphokinase (type I, Sigma), 2 mm EGTA, 18 μg of bovine serum albumin, 0.4 μm each dGTP, dCTP, dATP, and biotin-21-dUTP (CLONTECH)). When necessary, extracts were preincubated in the presence of DNA-PK inhibitor (wortmannin or LY294002 from Sigma) in reaction buffer without plasmids and dNTP for 10 min at 30 °C. After a 2-h incubation time at 30 °C, the wells were washed three times with PBST (phosphate-buffered saline solution, pH 7.4, plus 0.01% Tween 20). Biotin-21-dUMP incorporated into DNA was detected by incubation with ExtrAvidin conjugated to peroxidase (Sigma) diluted 1/10,000 in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.025% acetylated bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma) for 15 min at 30 °C. Wells were washed three times with PBST buffer, and 50 μl of chemiluminescent substrate mixture (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1.28 mm luminol and 145 μm 4-iodophenol(both from Aldrich), 30% H2O2 (w/v) diluted 1/25,000) was added for 5 min at 30 °C. Emitted light was measured with a luminometer (Lumax 2, SFRI, France) and expressed as a relative light unit. Experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate. DNA repair synthesis activity was expressed as the mean value of relative light unit in treated minus the value in untreated plasmid DNA. Standard 50-μl reaction mixtures contained 200 ng each of damaged and untreated closed-circular or linear plasmids, 74 kBq of [α-32P]dCTP (110 TBq/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), cell extract as indicated, and 60 mm potassium glutamate in reaction buffer containing 45 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 7.4 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 20 μm each of dGTP, dATP, and dTTP, 4 μm dCTP, 40 mmphosphocreatine, 2.5 μg of creatine phosphokinase (type I, Sigma), 3.4% glycerol, and 18 μg of bovine serum albumin as described (28Wood R.D. Robins P. Lindahl T. Cell. 1988; 53: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). When necessary, extracts were preincubated in the presence of DNA-PK inhibitor (wortmannin or LY294002 from Sigma) in reaction buffer without plasmids and dNTP for 10 min at 30 °C. Complete reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 3 h. Plasmid DNA was purified from the reaction, linearized with KpnI, and electrophoresed overnight on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Radiolabel incorporation was visualized by exposure to a storage phosphor screen (Molecular Dynamics) followed by processing with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Storm SystemTM). Data were quantified by scintillation counting of excised DNA bands. For data presentation, gels and phosphorimaging of the gels were processed with Adobe Photoshop 3.0 software. Standard 25-μl reactions contained 150 μg of HeLa nuclear extracts, 1 μg of plasmid DNA, 370 kBq of [α-32P]CTP (111 TBq/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 100 mm potassium glutamate in buffer containing 22 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 6.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm CTP, 0.5 mmeach of GTP and UTP, 1 mm ATP, 40 μm each of dGTP, dATP, dTTP, and dCTP, 20 mm phosphocreatine, 1 μg of creatine phosphokinase (type I, Sigma), 1.7% glycerol, 9 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 100 units of RNase T1 (Life Technologies, Inc.). When necessary, protein extracts were preincubated in the presence of wortmannin for 5 min at 30 °C and then plasmid DNA was added followed by a further 5-min preincubation period; then the other components were added and the reactions were carried out for 90 min at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated by addition of 175 μl of 0.3m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3 m sodium acetate, 0.5% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 3 μg/ml tRNA. RNase T1-resistant transcripts were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in gel loading buffer (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, and fractionated on a 6% acrylamide, 7 m urea gel. Radiolabel incorporation was visualized by exposure to a storage phosphor screen (Molecular Dynamics) followed by processing with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Storm SystemTM). The regions of the gel containing the RNase T1-resistant transcripts were quantitated by the ImageQuaNT software, version 4.2A (Molecular Dynamics). For data presentation, phosphorimaging of the gels was processed with Adobe Photoshop 3.0 software. Anti-Ku70 (N3H10), anti-Ku80 (111), anti-Ku70/80 (162) and anti-DNA-PKcs (18.2 and 25.4) were from Neomarkers (Fremont, CA). Polyclonal antibodies anti-XPA (31Jones C.J. Wood R.D.

Monoclonal antibodies anti-p62-TFIIH (3C9) were generous gifts from Dr. J. M. Egly (IGBMC, Illkirch, France). Monoclonal IgM antibody H14 against the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II LS) (32Bregman D.B. Halaban R. Vangool A.J. Henning K.A. Friedberg E.C. Warren S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For Ku or DNA-PKcs immunodepletion, anti-Ku70/80 (162) or anti DNA-PKcs (25-4) monoclonal antibodies were coupled to magnetic anti-mouse IgG beads (Dynabeads M-450, Dynal), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Under 20 μl final volume, 250 μg of HeLa nuclear protein extracts were incubated at 4 °C for 60 min with 20 μl of wet control, anti-Ku or anti-DNAPK beads in dialysis buffer under gentle agitation. The supernatant was removed over a magnet (Dynal MPC, Dynal). A second depletion was performed immediately under the same conditions. 50 ng of closed circular or linear plasmid DNA were adsorbed on sensitized 96-well microtiter plates as described above. DNA repair reactions were carried out as described above for the chemiluminescent detection of DNA repair synthesis in microplates. RNA transcription reactions were performed as described above for assays in microtubes, except that the reaction volume was 50 μl and radiolabeled CTP was omitted. After incubation, the protein fraction bound to DNA was analyzed after four washes with PBST as follows: proteins captured on microwells were eluted with 25 μl of sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4 m urea, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.003% bromphenol blue) (33Shah G.M. Poirier D. Duchaine C. Brochu G. Desmoyers S. Lagueux J. Verreault A. Hoflack J.-C. Kirkland J.B. Poirier G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 30 °C with shaking. DNA-binding proteins were removed from the microwells after 15 min of denaturation at 85 °C. DNA-binding fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature and proteins immunoblotted with monoclonal antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After incubating membrane secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, specific proteins were visualized as immunoreactive bands by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For data presentation, films were scanned and processed with Adobe Photoshop 3.0 software. Kinase activity was assessed under DNA repair conditions in microtitration wells. After DNA adsorption and washing as described above, 150 μg of HeLa protein extract were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C in standard repair buffer but without ATP. The wells were washed three times with PBST and then incubated 30 min at 30 °C with 185 kBq of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 2 mm ATP, wortmannin, when necessary, and 10 μg of DNA-PK-specific peptide substrate (SQE peptide, EPPLSQEAFADLWKK (34Finnie N.J.

The supernatant was then resolved by SDS-PAGE (22%) followed by processing with a Phosphor-Imager (Molecular Dynamics, Storm SystemTM). The regions of the gel containing the radiolabel peptide were quantitated by the ImageQuaNT software, version 4.2A (Molecular Dynamics). The DNA-binding fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%) and Western blotting as described above. In order to investigate in human nuclear cell extracts the influence of DNA-PK catalytic activity on Ku binding to DNA, we have taken advantage of an assay developed in our group using plasmid DNA quantitatively adsorbed on sensitized microplate wells, which has allowed us to reproduce DNA repair reactions (35Salles B. Provot C. Calsou P. Hennebelle I. Gosset I. Fournie G.J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and to analyze the DNA-bound protein fraction (24Li R.-Y. Calsou P. Jones C.J. Salles B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). First, we have adapted this assay to DNA-PK activity. As shown in Fig.1 A, the phosphorylation of a consensus peptide for DNA-PK activity was dependent on the presence of free DNA ends in microplates, as expected for true DNA-PK activity. In addition, this free DNA ends-dependent phosphorylation activity was inhibited by increasing concentrations of known inhibitors of DNA-PK like wortmannin (9Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C. Zhang H.

The high IC50concentrations measured (0.25 and 16 μm for wortmannin and LY 294002, respectively) may be explained by the ATP concentration (2 mm) used under our conditions for optimal repair activity (see below), knowing that these DNA-PK inhibitors can be competed with ATP (37Izzard R.A.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2581-2586PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 1Effect of wortmannin on protein kinase and DNA binding activities of DNA-PK in HeLa protein extracts as assessed with DNA bound to microwells.

As shown in Fig. 1 B, we observed a strong free ends-dependent Ku binding to DNA (compare the 1st two lanes). However, a strong binding inhibition was detected when the extracts were shortly preincubated with wortmannin in the absence of DNA and ATP (lanes 0–30 μm wortmannin). Preincubation of the extracts in the presence of inhibitor was necessary. Indeed, when increasing wortmannin concentrations were added to the reaction at the time of incubation with DNA bound to the wells, no effect was observed on Ku binding to DNA (data not shown), more likely due to the competing effect of ATP toward wortmannin at the time when DNA-PK contacts DNA. In addition, although Ku binding to DNA decreased in the presence of wortmannin, binding of the p460 DNA-PK catalytic subunit to DNA increased (Fig. 1 B). However, p460 DNA binding activity was still Ku-dependent since extracts immunodepleted of Ku dimer exhibited no p460 binding activity to linear DNA (data not shown). A Western blotting experiment was run with several dilutions of recombinant Ku heterodimer and purified p460 preparations in order to standardize the chemiluminescence detection.

https://openalex.org/W2000332946,"Evidence suggests that aggregated low density lipoprotein (AgLDL) accumulates in atherosclerotic lesions. Previously, we showed that AgLDL induces and enters surface-connected compartments (SCC) in human monocyte-derived macrophages by a process we have named patocytosis. Most AgLDL taken up by these macrophages in the absence of serum is stored in SCC and remains undegraded. We now show that macrophages released AgLDL (prepared by vortexing or treatment with phospholipase C or sphingomyelinase) from their SCC when exposed to 10% human lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS). Macrophages also took up AgLDL in the presence of LPDS, but subsequently released it. In both cases, the released AgLDL was disaggregated. Although the AgLDL that macrophages took up could not pass through a 0.45-μm filter, >60% of AgLDL could pass this filter after release from the macrophages. Disaggregation of AgLDL was verified by gel-filtration chromatography and electron microscopy that also showed particles larger than LDL, reflecting fusion of LDL that aggregates. The factor in serum that mediated AgLDL release and disaggregation was plasmin generated from plasminogen by macrophage urokinase plasminogen activator. AgLDL release was decreased >90% by inhibitors of plasmin (ε-amino caproic acid and anti-plasminogen mAb), and also by inhibitors of urokinase plasminogen activator (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and anti-urokinase plasminogen activator mAb). Moreover, plasminogen could substitute for LPDS and produce similar macrophage release and disaggregation of AgLDL. Because only plasmin bound to the macrophage surface is protected from serum plasmin inhibitors, interaction of AgLDL with macrophages was necessary for reversal of its aggregation by LPDS. The released disaggregated LDL particles were competent to stimulate LDL receptor-mediated endocytosis in cultured fibroblasts. Macrophage-mediated disaggregation of aggregated and fused LDL is a mechanism for transforming LDL into lipoprotein structures size-consistent with lipid particles found in atherosclerotic lesions."

These organisms lack the pathway for de novo purine biosynthesis and thus are entirely dependent upon their hosts to supply this nutrient for their survival, growth, and multiplication. The 3′-NT/NU is involved in the salvage of preformed purines via the hydrolysis of either 3′-nucleotides or nucleic acids. In Crithidia luciliae, this enzyme is highly inducible. For example, in these organisms purine starvation triggers an ∼1000-fold up-expression of 3′-NT/NU activity. In the present study, we cloned and characterized a gene encoding this intriguing enzyme from C. luciliae (Cl). Sequence analysis showed that the Cl 3′-NT/NU deduced protein possessed five regions, which we defined here as being characteristic of members of the class I nuclease family. Further, we demonstrated that the Cl 3′-NT/NU-expressed protein possessed both 3′-nucleotidase and nuclease activities. Moreover, we showed that the dramatic up-expression of 3′-NT/NU activity in response to purine starvation of C. luciliae was concomitant with the ∼100-fold elevation in steady-state mRNA specific for this gene.

World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland1997Google Scholar). Although purines are essential for the growth, multiplication and survival of these organisms, they are incapable of synthesizing the purine ring de novo. Thus, they are totally dependent upon their hosts to provide an exogenous source of preformed purines (1Bryant C. Behm C.A. Biochemical Adaptation in Parasites. Chapman and Hall, New York.1989: 71-91Google Scholar). In that regard, these purine auxotrophic organisms possess extracellular salvage mechanisms to acquire these essential nutrients from their host environments (2Hammond D.J. Gutteridge W.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasit. 1984; 13: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). One such trypanosomatid salvage enzyme is the externally oriented, bifunctional, surface membrane 3′-nucleotidase/nuclease (3′-NT/NU),1 which is capable of generating free nucleosides via the hydrolysis of either 3′-nucleotides or nucleic acids (3Gottlieb M. Parasitol. Today. 1989; 5: 257-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 4Bates P.A. Coombs G.H. North M.J. Biochemical Protozoology. Taylor & Francis, Washington, D.

Taylor & Francis, Washington, D. C.1991: 537-553Google Scholar, 5Debrabant A. Gottlieb M. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Among these organisms, however, only the 3′-NT/NU of Crithidia luciliae was shown to be dramatically up-expressed by ∼1000-fold in response to purine starvation conditions (6Gottlieb M. Science. 1985; 227: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Further, the C. luciliae 3′-NT/NU was shown to possess some biochemical and kinetic properties similar to those of the class I, single-strand-specific, nucleases of fungi and germinating plant seedlings (3Gottlieb M. Parasitol. Today. 1989; 5: 257-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 7Neubert T.A. Gottlieb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7236-7242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In light of these intriguing biochemical and physiological properties, experiments were designed in the current report to delineate the structure, function, and expression of the gene encoding this highly inducible enzyme of C. luciliae. Reagents used in this study were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Cultures of C. luciliae (ATCC strain no. 30285) (8Alleman M.M. Mann V.H. Bacchi C.J. Yarlett N. Gottlieb M. Dwyer D.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were grown at 26 °C in medium M199 (Life Technologies, Inc.), pH 6.8, as described previously (9McCarthy-Burke C. Bates P. Dwyer D.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1991; 73: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and supplemented here with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). A clone (MY101) was isolated by limiting dilution from such cultures and used for all subsequent experiments. For testing the effects of adenosine depletion on C. luciliae, replete cells were grown and maintained in chemically defined medium, RPMI 1640+ (9McCarthy-Burke C. Bates P. Dwyer D.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1991; 73: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with 100 μm adenosine, and “adenosine-starved” cells were incubated in such medium without adenosine for various periods up to 72 h. In all experiments, log-phase cell cultures (2–4 × 107/ml) were harvested by centrifugation as described previously (10Bates P.A. Hermes I. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 39: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Both the cells and the resulting cell-free culture supernatants were processed for various purposes as described below. For some experiments, C. luciliae were treated with 0.5 μg/ml tunicamycin as described previously (11Bates P.A. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 26: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Doyle P.S. Dwyer D.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 77: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The designations used in this report for genes, proteins, and plasmids follow the genetic nomenclature forTrypanosoma and Leishmania as outlined by Claytonet al. (13Clayton C. Adams M. Almeida R. Baltz T. Barret M. Bastien P. Belli S. Beverley S. Biteau N. Blackwell J. Blaineau C. Boshart M. Bringaud F. Cross G. Cruz G. Cruz A. Degrave W. Donelson J. El-Sayed N. Fu G. Ersfeld K. Gibson W.

Turner M. Ullu E. Vanhamme L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed based on the amino acid sequences conserved among the Leishmania donovani 3′-nucleotidase/nuclease (5Debrabant A. Gottlieb M. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), Aspergillus oryzae S1 nuclease (14Iwamatsu A. Aoyama H. Dibo G. Tsunasawa S. Sakiyama F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and Penicillium citrinum P1 nuclease (15Maekawa K. Tsunasawa S. Dibo G. Sakiyama F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) following a codon usage of C. luciliae RNA polymerase II (16Croan D.G. Ellis J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Such primers were synthesized by β-cyanoethylphosphoramidite chemistry using an Expedite nucleic acid synthesis system (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primer 1 (P1) (forward, 5′-GG(T CG)G A(CT) AT(C T)CA (AG)C CIC T(GC T)CA-3′) and primer 2 (P2) (reverse, 5′-(TC)T T(CG A)GC IAG ICG GTA (GCA) CC-3′) were used in PCR amplification of C. luciliae cDNA withTaq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Conditions for amplification were 94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min (36 cycles), and 74 °C for 10 min. The 436-nt product of this reaction was ligated to pCRII by TA cloning (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and the resulting plasmid was designatedpCl-436. Both strands of this plasmid were sequenced and found to have high homology with that of the L. donovani3′-NT/NU gene (5Debrabant A. Gottlieb M. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The pCl-436 insert was labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by PCR according to manufacturer's instructions. The resulting digoxigenin-labeled probe (DIG-436) was used for screening the C. luciliae cosmid library and for other hybridization studies. Genomic DNA was isolated from 109 washed C. luciliae using the GNome DNA isolation kit (Bio101, Vista, CA). A C. luciliaegenomic DNA library was constructed from EcoRV (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)-restricted genomic DNA, blunt end-ligated to a SuperCos I vector, phage-packaged and adsorbed onto hostEscherichia coli XL1 Blue MR all according to manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Over 3000 colonies from this library were screened by hybridization with the DIG-436 probe at high stringency (hybridization and washing in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C). Several positive clones were obtained. A 2.8-kb NcoI fragment from one of these cosmid clones (CosMY1) was subcloned into PCRScript (Stratagene), and the resulting plasmid (pCl-3) was used for sequence analysis. Plasmid DNA was sequenced using the fluorescent dideoxy-chain terminator method of cycle sequencing (Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on a model 373A Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencer. Sequence data from both strands were analyzed using the Wisconsin Package, version 10.0, Genetic Computer Group (GCG) software package running on the National Institutes of Health Unix System and Sequencher 3.0 software (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). Protein multiple sequence alignments were done using the ClustalW program (17Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55635) Google Scholar). For Southern blotting, C. luciliaegDNA was digested with various restriction endonucleases (AccI, AvaI, BglI, andSalI, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred under vacuum onto nylon membranes (HyBond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and cross-linked by UV irradiation. DIG-labeled PCR products were generated using thepCl-3 insert above as template and the appropriate oligonucleotide primers specific to the 5′-flanking (DIG-300, which spans nt −980 to nt −664) and 3′-flanking (DIG-420, which spans nt +864 to nt +1291) regions of the Cl 3′-NT/NU gene, respectively. Membranes were processed for hybridization at high stringency with either the DIG-300- or DIG-420-labeled probes according to the Genius system users' guide (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the hybridized fragments were visualized using the Genius detection system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Agarose plugs containing ∼1 × 108 washed C. luciliae or C. fasciculata were prepared for PFGE according to previously described methods (18Pogue G.P. Joshi M. Lee N.S. Dwyer D.M. Kenny R.T. Gam A.A. Nakhasi H.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 81: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Chromosomes were separated by PFGE in a Bio-Rad DRII PFGE apparatus using conditions described by Joshi et al. (19Joshi M. Dwyer D.M. Nakhasi H.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with ethidium bromide, blotted onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and processed for Southern blot hybridization with the DIG-436 probe as above. cDNA analyses were done in order to characterize the 5′-splice acceptor site and 3′-polyadenylation site of the Cl 3′-NT/NU gene. Since C. luciliae up-regulate their expression of 3′-nucleotidase activity in response to purine starvation (6Gottlieb M. Science. 1985; 227: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), mRNA was isolated from such cells using Poly(A) Pure (Ambion, Austin, TX). cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of poly(A)+ RNA obtained from cells starved for adenosine for 24 h using SuperScript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) and an oligo(dT)14 adaptor (5′-AGA AGA CGT AGG TTG ACT GCT GCA GTT TTT TTT TTT TTT-3′). Following RNase H (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) treatment, the resulting cDNA was used as template for PCR. In such reactions, the 5′ and 3′ ends of the Cl 3′-NT/NU cDNA were generated using the RACE method (20Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4333) Google Scholar). For 5′-RACE (i.e.splice acceptor site), forward primer was 5′-AAC GCT ATA TAT AAG TAT CAG TTT C-3′ and reverse was 5′-GAG AAC TCG TTG GCG TTG T-3′. For 3′-RACE (i.e. polyadenylation site), forward primer was 5′-ACC TAC GCC TCT ACG CTG A-3′ and adaptor was 5′-AGA AGA CGT AGG TTG ACT G-3′. PCRs were carried out using conditions as above, and the resulting fragments were also cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) as above. Subsequent sequencing of these fragments verified them as a part of theC. luciliae 3′-nucleotidase/nuclease gene. Full-length Cl 3′-NT/NU cDNA was generated by XL-PCR (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the 5′-RACE forward and 3′-RACE adapter primers and the cDNA synthesized above. The resulting 2.2-kb PCR product was ligated into PCRScript (Stratagene). Subsequently, this cloned insert was sequenced. Those results showed that this cDNA clone possessed sequences identical to those obtained from the 5′- and 3′-RACE products, as well as the Cl 3′-NT/NU ORF present in the pCl-3 genomic clone, above. A truncated construct of the Cl 3′-NT/NU gene was generated by PCR using pCl-3 as template and the appropriate oligonucleotide primers. The resulting fragment contained the Cl 3′-NT/NU 5′-UTR (nt −105 to nt −1) and a portion of the Cl 3′-NT/NU ORF (nt +1 to nt +1005). The resulting ∼1.1-kb PCR fragment was digested withSpeI and ligated into the SpeI site of the [pKSNEO] leishmanial expression vector (21Zhang W.W. Charest H. Ghedin E. Matlashewski G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid [pKSNEO-Cl 3′-nt/nu ΔC] and the [pKSNEO] control plasmid were transfected intoC. luciliae cells by electroporation essentially as described by Descoteaux et al. (22Descoteaux A. Garraway L.A. Ryan K.A. Garrity L.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 22-48Google Scholar). Following an overnight recovery in medium M199+ (9McCarthy-Burke C. Bates P. Dwyer D.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1991; 73: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with 10% fetal bovine serum at 26 °C, these cells were selected for their growth under increasing concentrations of Geneticin (G-418, Life Technologies, Inc.) up to 200 μg/ml. In some experiments, C. luciliae were treated with 0.5 μg/ml tunicamycin as described previously (11Bates P.A. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 26: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Doyle P.S. Dwyer D.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 77: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Lysates and cell-free culture supernatants from these transfectants were used in various experiments. 3′-Nucleotidase enzyme activity was measured in cell lysates and in cell-free culture supernatants in test tube assays, using adenosine 3′-monophosphate (3′-AMP) as substrate, as described previously (7Neubert T.A. Gottlieb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7236-7242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as 1 nmol of Pi released from the 3′-AMP/min per ml of cell-free culture supernatant or per mg of cell lysate protein. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid method (BCA, Pierce). Similar samples of C. luciliae were also assayed for total nuclease activity using poly(A) as substrate as described previously (23Gottlieb M. MacKow M.C. Neubert T.A. Exp. Parasitol. 1988; 66: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cell-free culture supernatants and cell lysates ofC. luciliae were separated by SDS-PAGE. These gels were processed for either in situ staining for 3′-nucleotidase activity (24Zlotonick G.W. Mackow M.C. Gottlieb M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 87B: 629-635Google Scholar, 7Neubert T.A.

Lett. 1993; 10: 53-58Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Similar SDS-PAGE gels were processed for Western blot analysis with various rabbit antisera or their preimmune sera as described previously (5Debrabant A. Gottlieb M. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). One of these was a rabbit antiserum (no. 1336, anti-Ld3′-NT/NU-specific) generated against a single internal peptide of the L. donovani 3′-nucleotidase/nuclease (amino acid residues Glu201–Tyr226) (5Debrabant A. Gottlieb M. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A second antiserum (no. 1398) was generated in a New Zealand White rabbit against an E. coli-expressed Ld 3′-NT/NU protein, which lacked both the N-terminal 25-aa signal peptide and the C-terminal 44 aa residues of the Ld 3′-NT/NU. Preimmune sera from these rabbits were used as controls. A DIG-labeled 1000-nt PCR product (DIG-1000), which spans nt 1–1005 of the Cl 3′-NT/NU ORF, was generated using the pCl-3 insert above as template and the appropriate oligonucleotide primers. An identical32P-labeled probe (32P-1000) was similarly generated. These probes were used in Northern blot analyses to quantitate the steady-state levels of specific mRNA present in adenosine-replete and adenosine-starved cells. Total RNAs were isolated from both adenosine-replete and adenosine-starved cells using STAT60 (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Equivalent amounts (20 μg) of these RNAs were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis (26Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), transferred onto nylon membranes (HyBond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and cross-linked by UV irradiation. Blots were hybridized at high stringency with either the DIG-1000 probe using Genius detection system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as above or with the32P-1000 probe as described previously (26Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Images obtained with the DIG-labeled probe were analyzed using the National Institutes of Health Image densitometry software package (available via the National Institutes of Health web site) and those obtained with the 32P-1000 labeled probe were quantified by phosphorimaging analyses using a PhosphorImager (model SI, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) driven by a Scanner Softwaremanager package (Molecular Dynamics). The above blots were subsequently rehybridized with either a 440-nt DIG- or 32P-labeled fragment of a cloned constitutively expressed C. luciliae α-tubulin gene ORF. 2M. Yamage, unpublished data. Nuclear run-on experiments were done with adenosine-replete and adenosine-starved cells to ascertain the rates at which they transcribed the Cl 3′-NT/NU gene. Nuclei were isolated from C. luciliae maintained for 24 h in either adenosine-replete or adenosine-starved medium using previously described methods (27Mahmood R. Ray D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23729-23734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Run-on transcriptions with [α-32P]rUTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were performed as described previously (28Burchmore R.J.S. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29118-29126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and similar experiments were also done using digoxigenin-UTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Slot blots were prepared on HyBond-N (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) membranes containing equivalent amounts of either a 436-bp internal DNA fragment (nt +446 to nt +881) of the Cl 3′-NT/NU gene, a similar sized (440 bp) internal fragment of the C. luciliae α-tubulin gene above, or a control linearized pBluescript plasmid (Stratagene). Such blots were hybridized with either the 32P-labeled or DIG-labeled nascent mRNAs, and the resulting signals were captured and analyzed as above. A 436-bp DNA fragment was obtained by RT-PCR using cDNA (derived from cells starved for adenosine for 12 h) as a template and a pair of the degenerate oligonucleotide primers: P1 and P2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). This fragment was cloned, sequenced, DIG-labeled, and used as a probe (DIG-436) to screen a C. luciliae gDNA cosmid library. Of the several clones identified from such screening, one cosmid clone (Cos MY1) was chosen for further analysis. Following restriction digestion of Cos MY1, a 2.8-kb NcoI fragment was isolated and subcloned into PCRScript and the resulting plasmid, pCl-3, was used for sequence analysis. Both strands of the cloned NcoI fragment were sequenced. Results of sequence analysis showed that the pCl-3 plasmid contained a complete ORF of 1,134 bp (Cl 3′-NT/NU, Fig.1). This ORF showed high nt sequence identity (69%) to the L. donovani 3′-nucleotidase/nuclease gene (5Debrabant A. Gottlieb M. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Moreover, sequence analysis revealed that G or C was the preferred base used at the third codon position in the Cl 3′-NT/NU. Out of 378 codons including TAG stop in this ORF, nearly 90% contained a C or G at the third nucleotide position (186 end with C and 154 end with G). Further, the overall composition of the Cl 3′-NT/NU is very GC-rich (65.0%).Figure 1Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the C. luciliae 3′-nucleotidase/nuclease (Cl 3′-NT/NU).

The combined results of restriction digestion of these two clones are summarized as a restriction map in Fig. 2 B. It is of importance to note that, with only a few exceptions (29Schneider A. McNally K.P. Agabien N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21868-21874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), trypanosomatid protozoa generally do not possess introns within their ORFs (30Fong D. Lee B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 31: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Further, all pre-mRNAs in these organisms are joined to a 39-nt conserved spliced leader at their 5′ end by trans-splicing (31Borst P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 701-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 32Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). To further characterize the organization of the Cl 3′-NT/NU, we compared the sequence of our genomic pCl-3 clone with that of the full-length cDNA clone. Results of these analyses revealed that the first in-frame start codon, ATG, was preceded by 105 bp of 5′-UTR (Figs. 1 and 2 B). The PyAG spliced-leader acceptor site was mapped to −106 bp from the start codon (Figs. 1 and2 B). As shown in Fig. 1, regions upstream of this site contained the sequences: CCTTGAC (−220 to −214), TGTTGAC (−156 to −150), and TTTCAAC (−125 to −119), which conform to the PyNPyPyPuAPy consensus (33Lewin B. Genes VII. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom2000Google Scholar). In the latter, nt A is the potential target for lariat formation during the pre-mRNA trans-splicing events (34Reed R. Maniatis T.R. Cell. 1985; 41: 95-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Further, short segments typical of canonical CAAT and TATA boxes, which are present in higher eukaryotes, but remain to be defined in trypanosomatid protozoa, were also found in the 5′-UTR of theCl 3′-NT/NU gene at −421 and −384 bp, respectively (Fig.1). Similar analyses of the region downstream from the 3′ end of theCl 3′-NT/NU ORF revealed three putative polyadenylation signals (AATAAA) at nt 2,062, 2,131, and 2,135 (Figs. 1 and2 B). These signals could direct a poly(A) tail to be added downstream of one of these sites. To assess the structure and copy number of theCl 3′-NT/NU, genomic DNA was digested with several restriction endonucleases and subjected to Southern hybridization with the DIG-labeled probes shown in Fig. 2 A. These enzymes were chosen because they possessed at least one predicted restriction site within the Cl 3′-NT/NU ORF (Fig. 2 B). Results of Southern hybridizations obtained with the DIG-300 probe (i.e. the 5′-flanking region of pCl-3) and with the DIG-420 probe (i.e. the 3′-flanking region ofpCl-3) are shown in Fig. 2 (C and D), respectively. The cumulative results of these analyses indicated that at least three copies of the Cl 3′-NT/NU gene are present within the diploid genome of C. luciliae. To identify the physical location(s) of the Cl 3′-NT/NUgenes, chromosomal DNA from C. luciliae and C. fasciculatawas separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide (Fig. 2 E, lanes 1 and2). These gels were blotted onto nylon membranes and hybridized with the Cl 3′-NT/NU DIG-436 probe above. Results of these assays demonstrated that the Cl 3′-NT/NU genes were all apparently localized to a single >1.6-megabase chromosome inC. luciliae (Fig. 2 E, lane 3) and to a similarly sized chromosome in Crithidia fasciculata (Fig. 2 E, lane 4). The latter is in agreement with a previous observations which demonstrated that C. fasciculata possess 3′-nucleotidase and nuclease activities (35Hassan H.F. Coombs G.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 23: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that the 3′-NT/NU gene is conserved among these closely related species of trypanosomatid parasites. TheCl 3′-NT/NU open reading frame of 1,134 bp encodes a deduced protein of 377 amino acids with a calculated mass of 40,575 Da (Fig.1). This deduced protein is acidic (∼16% acidic aa residues) and has a predicted isoelectric point (pI) of 5.63, which is in agreement with the pI of ∼5.8 as determined previously by two-dimensional electrophoresis of the native C. luciliae enzyme (7Neubert T.A. Gottlieb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7236-7242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis using the Kyte and Doolittle algorithm (46Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol.

Transient transfection studies in our laboratory showed that the LST1 gene product induced extensive thin cytoplasmic extensions in a wide variety of cells in vitro and, in particular, was strongly expressed in dendritic cells in vivo and in vitro. 2A. Raghunathan, R. Sivakamasundari, J. Wolenski, S. M. Weissman, manuscript in preparation. Due to alternative splicing, the LST1 gene in human and mouse encodes multiple transcripts, each 800 nucleotides or less in length. Previous studies on the human LST1 gene showed that this gene consisted of at least eight exons and four introns, including four different alternative 5′-UT exons (termed 1A, 1B, 1C, and 1D, respectively) and four additional exons spanning 2.7 kilobases. The extensive alternative splicing of LST1 mRNA results in high structural diversity of the putative encoded polypeptides (9de Baey A. Fellerhoff B. Maier S. Martinozzi S. Weidle U. Weiss E.H. Genomics. 1997; 45: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The DNA sequences between these 5′-UT exons do not consistently show sequence features resembling promoters. There are certain unusual features of the relationship between the human LST1 mRNA and the gene sequence. For example, one alternative intron of the LST1 gene begins with the dinucleotide GA rather than the common GT or the occasional GC. Interestingly, each of the four published 5′-UT exons is between 100 and 150 nucleotides in length and lies closely downstream of the sequence CCCAG. Furthermore, the genomic sequence in the vicinity of the 5′-UT exons contains at least two other stretches of sequences about the same length as the published 5′-UT exons in which the nucleotide stretches begin with a CCCAG and end with an apparently conventional 5′-end splice site sequence. Therefore, it is possible that one or more additional 5′-UT exons may exist in the 5′-flanking region of the human LST1gene. We carried out the present study to address the following questions. (a) Does the human LST1 gene have an additional 5′-UT exon, which serves as a common initial exon, or does transcription apparently begin separately upstream of each of the closely expressed alternative 5′-UT exons? (b) Where is the promoter in the 5′-flanking region of the human LST1 gene? (c) Which cis-acting elements are involved in the human LST1 gene expression? (d) Can we separate elements responsible for production of subsets of transcription initiation sites and splicing events in the LST1 gene? We have identified an additional 5′-UT exon upstream of the published exon 1A in U937 cells, a human monocytic cell line, indicating that there are at least five alternative 5′-UT first exons (termed 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, and 1e) that are spliced directly to exon 2 containing the ATG translation start codon. The exon 1b-exon 2 splicing pattern was the most abundant transcript of the human LST1 gene in U937 cells and the major transcription initiation site was located upstream of exon 1b. We have also characterized the human LST1 promoter region and regulatory elements. These studies suggest that a novel DNA-binding site and interaction of multiple regulatory elements may be involved in the regulation of the human LST1 gene expression. The total RNA of U937 cells (6 × 106) was isolated by using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and digested with 2 μl (10 units/μl) of RNase-free DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 30 min. 2 μg of the total RNA from U937 cells were reverse transcribed into first-strand cDNA using ThermoScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the reverse primer GSP-RTN (see Table I) designed from the exon 2 region of the human LST1 cDNA. After degrading the original RNA template with RNase H, the first-strand cDNA was extended from its 3′-end using terminal transferase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to form a poly(A) tail. The poly(A)-tailed cDNA was then used as a template in 30 cycles of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min with the antisense primer GSP3 and the sense primer QT and QO (14Frohman M.A. Dush M.K.

The products of PCR amplifications were subjected to a second PCR amplification with the primer GSP42N and the primer QI for another 30 cycles. The PCR products of the second amplification were separated by gel electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose gel. Purified PCR fragments were cloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced.

Open table in a new tab The different genomic fragments of the 5′-flanking region of the human LST1gene were amplified by PCR using primers designed withSacI/NcoI restriction sites, and then inserted into the SacI-NcoI sites upstream of the luciferase gene in the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) to generate various LST1 reporter constructs. The pGL2423Ap construct (−1363 to −621 plus −112 to −54) was generated by digesting the pGL2423 construct (−1363 to −54) with ApaI to delete the fragment spanning from −621 to −112, relative to the translation start codon.

The pGL24SX34 construct was generated by replacing the luciferase gene in the pGL2423 construct with the entire downstream region (−51 to +1368) that included the middle of exon 2 and the end of exon 5, and putting an insert of 87 nucleotides amplified from the luciferase gene as a marker in a position −54 bp upstream of the translation start ATG codon. The mutant pGL2423mAp construct was generated by overlap extension using PCR (15Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R.

Two partially overlapping fragments were amplified using either USP2S and GSPmII or USPII and GSP42N as primers (see Table I), and these fragments were combined and used as template DNA in the second PCR reaction with primers USP2S and GSP42N to generate an 802-bp PCR product. The final PCR product was digested withNcoI-SacI and subcloned into the pGL3-Basic vector. The orientation and sequence of the inserts were verified by sequencing through the insert-vector junctions. The plasmid DNA was purified according to the Plasmid Maxi Kit (QIAGEN) manual. The U937 cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Media and reagents for cell culture were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. unless otherwise indicated. The U937 cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containingl-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells in each well of 24-well plates were transfected with 1.5 μg of promoter-reporter constructs and 4 μl of the FuGene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were washed, lysed, and centrifuged. The luciferase activity in the nuclear extracts was measured with a commercial luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions and luminescence was determined with an LB9510 Lumat illuminometer (Berthold, Germeny). All cell lysate concentrations were normalized to recovered protein concentrations that were measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay based on the method of Bradford (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar). The luciferase activities of the constructs are shown as a value relative to that of the pGL3-Control vector that contains the SV40 promoter (Promega), which was arbitrarily set to 100%. Each transfection was performed in duplicate and repeated three times or more. The plasmid pCMV-β-gal (CLONTECH) was used as a control for transfection efficiency. In addition, different cell lines, such as K562, Jurkat, 293T, and HeLa (from our laboratory storage) were also used in the transfection experiments with certain reporter constructs. For the IFN-γ stimulation experiment, U937 cells transfected with the pGL2423Ap construct were treated with 50, 100, 200, or 500 units/ml IFN-γ (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 6, 24, and 48 h prior to performing the luciferase assay. 1 μg of the 24SA probe (405 bp) recovered by digesting the pGL24SA construct (−1363 to −1001 plus −112 to −54) with SacI-NcoI was labeled by filling in the 5′-end overhangs with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow polymerase. The unincorporated [α-32P]dCTP was removed by using Sephadex G-50 columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hybridization of 1 ng of the labeled 24SA probe with 5 μg of the total RNA from U937 cells was performed in 10 μl of hybridization buffer (80% deionized formamide, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Pipes, pH 6.4) and incubated at 42 °C overnight. 300 units of S1 nuclease were added to digest the unbound single strand DNA at 37 °C for 30 min. The digested DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation and analyzed on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. The 24SA probe was sequenced according to the manual of the T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After U937 cells were transfected with promoter report constructs (e.g. pGL2423, pGL54212, pGL4214, pGL24SX34, and pGL3C8S) for 48 h, the total RNA of U937 cells (6 × 106) was isolated by using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and digested with 2 μl (10 units/μl) of RNase free DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 30 min to remove traces of contaminating DNA. 2 μg of total RNA from these cells were reverse transcribed into first strand cDNA with ThermoScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc., Life Technologies, Inc.). 2 μl of the first strand cDNA were used in 50 μl of PCR with the sense primers for different forms of the 5′-UT exon 1 (such as USP2 for exon 1a, USP1S for exon 1b, USP7 for exon 1c, USP8 for exon 1d, and USP10 for exon 1e) and the antisense primers (Luc1 for vector or GSP-RTN for exon 2). The second round of PCR reaction was performed with different internal primers (USP2S, USP1, USP7, USP81, and USP10S) and the primer (Luc2) from vector and the primer (GSP42N) from exon 2. The DNase-treated RNA without reverse transcriptase was used as a control for the PCR reactions. The PCR reaction was performed for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were electrophoresed in a 2.0% agarose gel and subcloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen) for sequencing. The nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Lee et al. (18Lee K.A.W. Zerivitz K. Akusjari G. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, Inc., New York1994: 668-670Google Scholar). Briefly, after U937 cells were washed with a phosphate buffer, the pellets were resuspended in one packed cell volume of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and placed on ice for 15 min before disruption with a hypodermic syringe with a narrow-gauge needle attached. After centrifugation, the crude nuclear pellet was suspended in 0.7 volume of buffer C (20 mm Hepes pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 420 mmNaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice by stirring for 30 min. The nuclear debris was centrifuged and the supernatant was dialyzed for 1.5 h in 500 ml of buffer D (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation of the extracts, the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and stored at −80 °C until use. The two segments spanning from −1364 to −954 and from −1001 to −621 plus −113 to −55, which were generated by digesting the pGL24SA and the pGL14266Ap constructs with SacI-NcoI, were incubated with nuclear extracts and subjected to DNase I footprinting analysis. The 3′-end of the segment was labeled by filling in 5′-overhangs with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow polymerase. The unincorporated [α-32P]dCTP was removed by using Sephadex G-50 columns. Binding reactions were performed in a total volume of 50 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. 20–40 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with 1 ng of radiolabeled probes at 4 °C for 20 min. CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 2.5 mm, and 0.3 units of freshly diluted DNase I (Promega) were subsequently added to digest the probe at room temperature for 1 min. Digestion was stopped by adding an equal volume of stop buffer (200 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml yeast RNA). The reaction mixtures were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) followed by ethanol precipitation. The digested probes were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6% urea-polyacrylamide gel. The two probes were sequenced with the T7 sequencing kit. Oligonucleotides for mobility shift analyses were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The reactions were stopped by adding 80 μl of TE buffer and heated at 70 °C for 10 min. The unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed by using Sephadex G-25 columns. 10 ng of radiolabeled oligonucleotides were added to 8 μg of the U937 cell nuclear extracts in a final volume of 25 μl containing 1 μg of nonspecific competitor poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The DNA-protein complexes were separated from the free DNA by electrophoresis through a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × TBE buffer. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Competition experiments included a 100-fold excess of cold unlabeled DNA oligonucleotides, while supershift analysis included the addition of 0.8–1.0 μg of anti-PU.1 and anti-SRY antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Biotech, Inc.) to the mixture and incubation for an additional 20 min. Oligonucleotides mutated at certain DNA-binding sites, such as putative PU.1, SOX5, and C/EBPβ sites (see Table I), were also used in EMSA. Using RNA from U937 cells that strongly express the LST1 gene, we performed RT-PCR with primers (see Table I) designed to be unique for upstream sequences of the potential first exons and identified an additional exon 1 (termed exon 1a) that resides upstream of the published exon 1A (equivalent to the exon 1b in present study) of the LST1 gene (Fig. 1). Therefore, there are five alternative first exons (termed 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, and 1e) in the 5′-flanking region of the human LST1 gene (Fig. 2). To determine the 5′-ends of the various mRNA forms, we performed 5′-RACE with RNA from U937 cells. The sequencing results from 36 cDNA clones of 5′-RACE products demonstrated that 23 clones (64%) represented the exon 1b-exon 2 splicing pattern (Fig. 3); two clones (5.6%) represented the exon 1c-exon 2 splicing pattern; one clone (2.8%) represented the exon 1e-exon 2 splicing pattern; and 11 clones (27.8%) represented unspliced RNA containing exon 1e, the intron between exon 1e and exon 2. These findings indicate that the transcription initiation site in exon 1b of the LST1 gene is preferentially utilized, and the exon 1b-exon 2 splice form is the most abundant transcript of the human LST1 mRNA.Figure 2Nucleotide sequence of the 5′-flanking region comprising the promoter of the human LST1 gene.Nucleotides are numbered on the left from the ATG translation start codon (indicated by a rhombus) present in exon 2. Potential cis-acting sequences determined by searching the data bases of TRANSFAC and TESS are indicated by dotted lines. The 5′-UT exons are underlined.

The 5′-RACE experiment was performed using a pair of primers, QI and GSP42N, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The 5′-RACE products were subcloned and sequenced. 23 out of 36 cDNA products with exon 1b-exon 2 splicing are denoted with arrows. Thethick arrows indicate that more than one 5′-RACE product has the same upstream end. The nucleotide sequence of transcript of exon 1b-exon 2 splicing is shown on the top. Numbers are relative to the translation start codon within exon 2. The trianglerepresents the major transcription start site by the majority of 5′-RACE products (8 clones). The star represents the major transcription start site identified by an S1 nuclease protection assay. The sequence complementary to the antisense primer GSP42N isunderlined. The arrow represents the junction of exon 1b and exon 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To characterize the LST1 gene promoter, a series of different reporter plasmid constructs that contained various 5′-flanking regions of theLST1 gene were generated in the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-Basic. We first prepared several deleted constructs that contained the 5′-flanking regions of each possible transcript of this gene (Fig.4 A). The levels of relative luciferase activities from extracts of transiently transfected U937 cells showed that the pGL2423 construct (−1363 to −54) that contained all 5′-UT alternative exons of the LST1 gene including exons 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, and 1e had substantially stronger promoter activity than those constructs with longer or shorter 5′-flanking regions of theLST1 gene. The promoter activity of the pGL14266 construct (−1001 to −54) with deletion of the exon 1a-exon 1b genomic region (−1363 to −1001) dropped by a large amount compared with that of the pGL2423 construct, which suggests that the region from exon 1a to exon 1b (−1363 to −1001) is important for the LST1 promoter activity. However, as shown in Fig. 4 B, the pGL24ApSt construct that contained the region from exon 1a to exon 1b (−1363 to −954) alone did not demonstrate strong promoter activity. Based on the pGL2423 construct, we further narrowed down the region within exon 1a-exon 2 and found that (a) the apparent promoter activity of the pGL12S10N construct (−1277 to −268) with deletion of the exon 1e-exon 2 region (−267 to −54) was reduced about 50% compared with that of the pGL12STN (−1277 to −54); (b) on comparison of the pGL24ApSt (−1363 to −954) with the pGL2S11N construct (−1363 to −579), the promoter activity of the latter construct that contained the exon 1b-exon 1c region was about 60% higher than that of the pGL24ApSt, indicating that the exon 1b-exon 1c region is also important; (c) comparison of the pGL12S10N (−1277 to −268) with the pGL12S11N (−1277 to −579) showed that the promoter activity of the latter construct with the deletion of the exon 1c-exon 1e region (−578 to −268) was relatively higher than that of the pGL12S10N (Fig.4 B). This result may indicate that the region from exon 1c to upstream of exon 1e contains some silencer elements. The above deleted constructs did not contain the upstream region of exon 2 that included the splice site at the beginning of exon 2, and this may be a reason why these constructs (e.g. pGL12S10N, pGL12S11N, pGL2S11N etc.) produced relatively lower levels of luciferase mRNA. Therefore, beginning with the pGL2423 construct, we generated the deleted pGL2423Ap construct (−1363 to −621 plus −112 to −54) that retained the sequences from the region upstream of exon 2. As we expected, the result demonstrated that the pGL2423Ap construct produced more RNA than the other constructs (Fig.4 C). Further deletion of this pGL2423Ap construct remarkably reduced its promoter activity as seen with constructs pGL12SNAp (−1277 to −621 plus −112 to −54), pGL14266Ap (−1001 to −54 plus −112 to −54), pGL24W13 (−1363 to −811 plus −112 to −54), and pGL24SA (−1363 to −954 plus −112 to −54). Furthermore, the promoter activities of two constructs that contained the exon 1a-exon 1b region (e.g. pGL24ApSt) and exon 1b-exon 1c region (e.g.pGL14266Ap), respectively, were significantly decreased (Fig.4 C).
