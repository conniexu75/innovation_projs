https://openalex.org/W3091995338,"This study analyzes the effects of COVID-19 confinement on the autonomous learning performance of students in higher education. Using a field experiment with 458 students from three different subjects at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (Spain), we study the differences in assessments by dividing students into two groups. The first group (control) corresponds to academic years 2017/2018 and 2018/2019. The second group (experimental) corresponds to students from 2019/2020, which is the group of students that had their face-to-face activities interrupted because of the confinement. The results show that there is a significant positive effect of the COVID-19 confinement on students’ performance. This effect is also significant in activities that did not change their format when performed after the confinement. We find that this effect is significant both in subjects that increased the number of assessment activities and subjects that did not change the student workload. Additionally, an analysis of students’ learning strategies before confinement shows that students did not study on a continuous basis. Based on these results, we conclude that COVID-19 confinement changed students’ learning strategies to a more continuous habit, improving their efficiency. For these reasons, better scores in students’ assessment are expected due to COVID-19 confinement that can be explained by an improvement in their learning performance."
https://openalex.org/W3091894475,"In Bangladesh, an array of measures have been adopted to control the rapid spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. Such general population control measures could significantly influence perception, knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. Here, we assessed KAP towards COVID-19 immediately after the lock-down measures were implemented and during the rapid rise period of the outbreak. Online-based cross-sectional study conducted from March 29 to April 19, 2020, involving Bangladeshi residents aged 12–64 years, recruited via social media. After consenting, participants completed an online survey assessing socio-demographic variables, perception, and KAP towards COVID-19. Of the 2017 survey participants, 59.8% were male, the majority were students (71.2%), aged 21–30 years (57.9%), having a bachelor's degree (61.0%), having family income >30,000 BDT (50.0%), and living in urban areas (69.8). The survey revealed that 48.3% of participants had more accurate knowledge, 62.3% had more positive attitudes, and 55.1% had more frequent practices regarding COVID-19 prevention. Majority (96.7%) of the participants agreed ‘COVID-19 is a dangerous disease’, almost all (98.7%) participants wore a face mask in crowded places, 98.8% agreed to report a suspected case to health authorities, and 93.8% implemented washing hands with soap and water. In multiple logistic regression analyses, COVID-19 more accurate knowledge was associated with age and residence. Sociodemographic factors such as being older, higher education, employment, monthly family income >30,000 BDT, and having more frequent prevention practices were the more positive attitude factors. More frequent prevention practice factors were associated with female sex, older age, higher education, family income > 30,000 BDT, urban area residence, and having more positive attitudes. To improve KAP of general populations is crucial during the rapid rise period of a pandemic outbreak such as COVID-19. Therefore, development of effective health education programs that incorporate considerations of KAP-modifying factors is needed."
https://openalex.org/W3092349029,"Going for the gold Single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a go-to technique for structural biologists. Although data-processing and reconstruction methods have improved, innovations in sample preparation and data collection are essential to reliably achieve high-resolution reconstructions while also reducing the amount of time required per structure. Naydenova et al. tackled the issue of electron beam–induced particle movement, a major source of information loss, by designing a gold sample support that prevents buckling of the extremely thin layer of ice in which the particles are suspended (see Perspective by Rapp and Carragher). The negligible particle displacement permits extrapolation to “zero exposure” structure factors, revealing features typically lost in cryo-EM structures. Far fewer particles per unit resolution are required, which greatly accelerates structure determination, especially at high resolution. Science , this issue p. 223 ; see also p. 171"
https://openalex.org/W3091842680,"Background A greater understanding of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in an infected population is important for the development of a vaccination. Aim To investigate SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG antibodies in Thai patients with differing severities of COVID-19. Methods Plasma from the following patient groups was examined: 118 adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, 49 patients under investigation (without confirmed infections), 20 patients with other respiratory infections, and 102 healthy control patients. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from EUROIMMUN was performed to assess for IgA and IgG antibodies. The optical density (OD) ratio cutoff for a positive result was 1.1 for IgA and 0.8 for IgG. Additionally, the association of the antibody response with both the severity of disease and the date after onset of symptoms was analyzed. Results A total of 289 participants were enrolled and 384 samples analyzed from March 10 to May 31, 2020. Patients were categorized, based on their clinical manifestations, as mild (n = 59), moderate (n = 27), or severe (n = 32). The overall sensitivity of IgA and IgG from the samples collected after day 7 of the symptoms was 87.9% (95% CI: 79.8–93.6) and 84.8% (95% CI: 76.2–91.3), respectively. Compared to the mild group, the severe group had significantly higher levels of spike 1 (S1) antigen-specific IgA and IgG. All patients in the moderate and severe groups had S1-specific IgG, while 20% of the patients in the mild group did not have any IgG detected after two weeks after the onset of symptoms. Interestingly, in the severe group, the SARS-CoV-2 IgG level was significantly higher in males than females (p = 0.003). Conclusion The serological test for SARS-CoV-2 has a high sensitivity more than two weeks after the onset of illness. Additionally, the serological response differs among patients based on sex as well as the severity of infection."

How can forward-ordered neural activity facilitate the storage or expression of reverse-ordered sequences? Wang et al. used multitetrode recordings from many individual hippocampal CA1 neurons in rats while simultaneously recording field potentials expressing theta oscillations. Spatial representation in the place cell network oscillated between forward and backward sweeps within each theta oscillation. Backward replay was associated with theta peaks, whereas forward replay was associated with theta troughs. Most cells fell into one category, but some corresponding to deep-layer neurons showed bimodular responses. Backward replay was driven by entorhinal inputs, whereas forward replay was evoked by CA3 inputs. These are important insights into the underlying basis of coding future and past experiences.

https://openalex.org/W3092143711,"In this study we present the first comprehensive analysis of the spatio-temporal differences in excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. We used a population-based design on all-cause mortality data, for the 7,904 Italian municipalities. We estimated sex-specific weekly mortality rates for each municipality, based on the first four months of 2016–2019, while adjusting for age, localised temporal trends and the effect of temperature. Then, we predicted all-cause weekly deaths and mortality rates at municipality level for the same period in 2020, based on the modelled spatio-temporal trends. Lombardia showed higher mortality rates than expected from the end of February, with 23,946 (23,013 to 24,786) total excess deaths. North-West and North-East regions showed one week lag, with higher mortality from the beginning of March and 6,942 (6,142 to 7,667) and 8,033 (7,061 to 9,044) total excess deaths respectively. We observed marked geographical differences also at municipality level. For males, the city of Bergamo (Lombardia) showed the largest percent excess, 88.9% (81.9% to 95.2%), at the peak of the pandemic. An excess of 84.2% (73.8% to 93.4%) was also estimated at the same time for males in the city of Pesaro (Central Italy), in stark contrast with the rest of the region, which does not show evidence of excess deaths. We provided a fully probabilistic analysis of excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic at sub-national level, suggesting a differential direct and indirect effect in space and time. Our model can be used to help policy-makers target measures locally to contain the burden on the health-care system as well as reducing social and economic consequences. Additionally, this framework can be used for real-time mortality surveillance, continuous monitoring of local temporal trends and to flag where and when mortality rates deviate from the expected range, which might suggest a second wave of the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3092308304,"Advances in low-dimensional superconductivity are often realized through improvements in material quality. Apart from a small group of organic materials, there is a near absence of clean-limit two-dimensional (2D) superconductors, which presents an impediment to the pursuit of numerous long-standing predictions for exotic superconductivity with fragile pairing symmetries. Here, we report the development of a bulk superlattice consisting of the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductor 2$H$-niobium disulfide (2$H$-NbS$_2$) and a commensurate block layer that yields dramatically enhanced two-dimensionality, high electronic quality, and clean-limit inorganic 2D superconductivity. The structure of this material may naturally be extended to generate a distinct family of 2D superconductors, topological insulators, and excitonic systems based on TMDs with improved material properties."
https://openalex.org/W3092462291,"Background After a COVID-19 diagnosis, vulnerable populations face considerable logistical and financial challenges to isolate and quarantine. We developed and evaluated a novel, community-based approach (‘Test-to-Care’ Model) designed to address these barriers for socioeconomically vulnerable Latinx individuals with newly diagnosed COVID-19 and their households. Methods This three-week demonstration project was nested within an epidemiologic surveillance study in a primarily Latinx neighborhood in the Mission district of San Francisco, California. The Test-to-Care model was developed with input from community members and public health leaders. Key components included: (1) provision of COVID-19-related education and information about available community resources, (2) home deliveries of material goods to facilitate safe isolation and quarantine (groceries, personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies), and (3) longitudinal clinical and social support. Newly SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive participants were eligible to participate. Components of the model were delivered by the Test-to-Care team, which was comprised of healthcare providers and community health workers (CHWs) who provided longitudinal clinic- and community-based support for the duration of the isolation period to augment existing services from the Department of Public Health (DPH). We evaluated the Test-to-Care Model using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework and drew upon multiple data sources including: programmatic data, informal interviews with participants and providers/CHWs and structured surveys among providers/CHWs. Results Overall, 83 participants in the surveillance study were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 95% (79/83) were Latinx and 88% (65/74) had an annual household income <$50,000. Ninety-six percent (80/83) of participants were reached for results disclosure, needs assessment and DPH linkage for contact tracing. Among those who underwent an initial needs assessment, 45% (36/80) were uninsured and 55% (44/80) were not connected to primary care. Sixty-seven percent (56/83) of participants requested community-based CHW support to safely isolate at their current address and 65% (54/83) of all COVID-19 participants received ongoing community support via CHWs for the entire self-isolation period. Participants reported that the intervention was highly acceptable and that their trust increased over time–this resulted in 9 individuals who disclosed a larger number of household members than first reported, and 6 persons who requested temporary relocation to a hotel room for isolation despite initially declining this service; no unintended harms were identified. The Test-to-Care Model was found to be both acceptable and feasible to providers and CHWs. Challenges identified included a low proportion of participants linked to primary care despite support (approximately 10% after one month), and insufficient access to financial support for wage replacement. Conclusions The Test-to-Care Model is a feasible and acceptable intervention for supporting self-isolation and quarantine among newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients and their households by directly addressing key barriers faced by socioeconomically vulnerable populations."
https://openalex.org/W3092511514,"Objectives To describe the health of intersex adults (people with differences of sex development) in the U.S. using community-based research methods. Methods In July–September 2018, we conducted a national health study of intersex adults aged 18 and older in the U.S., using a survey hosted on Qualtrics. The study describes the physical and mental health experiences of intersex adults, including differences by age (18 to 39 vs. 40 and older). Questions were derived from national (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) and intersex-related health studies. Results A non-probability sample of 198 intersex adults completed the survey over three months. Over 43% of participants rated their physical health as fair/poor and 53% reported fair/poor mental health. Prevalent health diagnoses included depression, anxiety, arthritis, and hypertension, with significant differences by age. Nearly a third reported difficulty with everyday tasks and over half reported serious difficulties with cognitive tasks. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first national study of intersex adults in the U.S. Greater understanding of intersex health over the life course is essential. Findings highlight the need for longitudinal studies and further examination of potential health disparities experienced by intersex populations."
https://openalex.org/W3092014753,"Abstract Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is an extremely recalcitrant disease capable of bypassing current targeted therapies via engagement of several growth promoting pathways. SH2 containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP2) is an oncogenic phosphatase known to facilitate growth and survival signaling downstream of numerous receptor inputs. Herein, we used inducible genetic depletion and two distinct pharmacological inhibitors to investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting SHP2 in MBC. Cells that acquired resistance to the ErbB kinase inhibitor, neratinib, displayed increased phosphorylation of SHP2 at the Y542 activation site. In addition, higher levels of SHP2 phosphorylation, but not expression, were associated with decreased survival of breast cancer patients. Pharmacological inhibition of SHP2 activity blocked ERK1/2 and AKT signaling generated from exogenous stimulation with FGF2, PDGF, and hGF and readily prevented MBC cell growth induced by these factors. SHP2 was also phosphorylated upon engagement of the extracellular matrix (ECM) via focal adhesion kinase. Consistent with the potential of SHP2-targeted compounds as therapeutic agents, the growth inhibitory property of SHP2 blockade was enhanced in ECM-rich 3D culture environments. In vivo blockade of SHP2 in the adjuvant setting decreased pulmonary metastasis and extended the survival of systemic tumor-bearing mice. Finally, inhibition of SHP2 in combination with FGFR-targeted kinase inhibitors synergistically blocked the growth of MBC cells. Overall, our findings support the conclusion that SHP2 constitutes a shared signaling node allowing MBC cells to simultaneously engage a diversity of growth and survival pathways, including those derived from the ECM."
https://openalex.org/W3091870652,"Background In this paper, we predict the health and economic consequences of immediate investment in personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers (HCWs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods To account for health consequences, we estimated mortality for HCWs and present a cost-effectiveness and return on investment (ROI) analysis using a decision-analytic model with Bayesian multivariate sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. Data sources included inputs from the World Health Organization Essential Supplies Forecasting Tool and the Imperial College of London epidemiologic model. Results An investment of $9.6 billion USD would adequately protect HCWs in all LMICs. This intervention would save 2,299,543 lives across LMICs, costing $59 USD per HCW case averted and $4,309 USD per HCW life saved. The societal ROI would be $755.3 billion USD, the equivalent of a 7,932% return. Regional and national estimates are also presented. Discussion In scenarios where PPE remains scarce, 70–100% of HCWs will get infected, irrespective of nationwide social distancing policies. Maintaining HCW infection rates below 10% and mortality below 1% requires inclusion of a PPE scale-up strategy as part of the pandemic response. In conclusion, wide-scale procurement and distribution of PPE for LMICs is an essential strategy to prevent widespread HCW morbidity and mortality. It is cost-effective and yields a large downstream return on investment."
https://openalex.org/W3092332313,"We examine how solitary confinement correlates with self-reported adverse physical health outcomes, and how such outcomes extend the understanding of the health disparities associated with incarceration. Using a mixed methods approach, we find that solitary confinement is associated not just with mental, but also with physical health problems. Given the disproportionate use of solitary among incarcerated people of color, these symptoms are most likely to affect those populations. Drawing from a random sample of prisoners (n = 106) in long-term solitary confinement in the Washington State Department of Corrections in 2017, we conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) assessments; and systematic reviews of medical and disciplinary files for these subjects. We also conducted a paper survey of the entire long-term solitary confinement population (n = 225 respondents) and analyzed administrative data for the entire population of prisoners in the state in 2017 (n = 17,943). Results reflect qualitative content and descriptive statistical analysis. BPRS scores reflect clinically significant somatic concerns in 15% of sample. Objective specification of medical conditions is generally elusive, but that, itself, is a highly informative finding. Using subjective reports, we specify and analyze a range of physical symptoms experienced in solitary confinement: (1) skin irritations and weight fluctuation associated with the restrictive conditions of solitary confinement; (2) un-treated and mis-treated chronic conditions associated with the restrictive policies of solitary confinement; (3) musculoskeletal pain exacerbated by both restrictive conditions and policies. Administrative data analyses reveal disproportionate rates of racial/ethnic minorities in solitary confinement. This analysis raises the stakes for future studies to evaluate comparative prevalence of objective medical diagnoses and potential causal mechanisms for the physical symptoms specified here, and for understanding differential use of solitary confinement and its medically harmful sequelae."

Our aim was to examine the difference in length of stay and the hazard ratio for a routine hospital discharge between SUD patients receiving and not receiving ACS.Structured EHR data from 2018 of 1,900 adult patients with a SUD-related diagnostic code at an urban academic health center were examined among 35,541 total encounters. Cox proportional hazards regression models were fit using a cause-specific approach to examine differences in hospital outcome (i.e., routine discharge, leaving against medical advice, in-hospital death, or transfer to another level of care). Models were adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, insurance status, and comorbidities.Length of stay was shorter among encounters with a SUD that received a SUIT consultation versus those admissions that did not receive one (5.77 v. 6.54 days, p<0.01). In adjusted analyses, admissions that received a SUIT consultation had a higher hazard of a routine discharge [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 1.16 (1.03-1.30)] compared to those not receiving a SUIT consultation.The SUIT consultation service was associated with a reduced length of stay and an increased hazard of a routine discharge. The SUIT model may serve as a benchmark and inform other health systems attempting to improve outcomes in SUD patient cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W3092311618,"During recent years, China has become a hotspot for the domestication of mandarin fish, and this is of great commercial value. Although the food preference of domesticated mandarin fish has been studied, little is known about genes regulating their growth. We raised hybrid mandarin fish on artificial feed for 3 months, the results showed that the survival rate of hybrid mandarin fish was 60.00%. Their total length and body weight were 18.34 ±0.43 cm and 100.44 ±4.87 g. The absolute length and weight gain rates were 0.14 cm/d and 1.08 g/d, respectively. Finally, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed to identify potential genes and pathways activated in response to growth performance. The transcriptome analysis generated 68, 197 transcripts and 45,871 unigenes. Among them, 1025 genes were up-regulated and 593 genes were down-regulated between the fast- and slow-growth fish. Finally, we obtained 32 differentially expressed genes, which were mainly related to fatty acid biosynthesis (e.g. FASN and ACACB), collecting duct acid secretion (e.g. ATP6E and KCC4), cell cycle (e.g. CDC20 and CCNB), and the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system (IGFBP1). These pathways might be related to the growth of hybrid mandarin fish. In addition, more potential single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in the fast-growth fish than in the slow-growth fish. The results suggest that the interaction of metabolism and abundant alleles might determine the growth of hybrid mandarin fish after food conversion."
https://openalex.org/W3092332739,"Globally, usage of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in elderly with chronic pain has been reported as frequent. Though NSAIDs are fundamental in maintaining their quality of life, the risk of polypharmacy, drug interactions and adverse effects is of paramount importance as the elderly usually require multiple medications for their co-morbidities. If prescriptions are not appropriately monitored and managed, they are likely to expose patients to serious drug interactions and potentially fatal adverse effects. This study was conducted to assess the appropriateness of NSAIDs use and determine the risk of NSAIDs related potential interactions in elderly. An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted among elderly out-patients (aged 60 and above) who visited three hospitals in Asmara, Eritrea, between August 22 and September 29, 2018. A stratified random sampling design was employed and data was collected using an interview-based questionnaire and by abstracting information from patients' prescriptions and medical cards. Descriptive and analytical statistics including chi-square test and logistic regression were employed using IBM SPSS (version 22). A total of 285 respondents were enrolled in the study with similar male to female ratio. One in four of all respondents were chronic NSAIDs users and NSAIDs risk practice was reported in 24%. Using chronic NSAIDs without prophylactic gastro-protective agents, self-medication, polypharmacy and drug-drug interactions were the main problems identified. A total of 322 potential interactions in 205 patients were identified and of which, 97.2% were classified as moderate, 0.6% severe and the rest were mild. Those who involved in self-medication were more likely to be exposed to drug interactions. Diabetes (AOR = 2.39, 95% CI: 1.14, 5.02) and hypertension (AOR = 9.06, 95% CI: 4.00, 20.51) were associated with chronic NSAIDs use and incidence of potential drug interactions (AOR = 3.5, 95%CI: 1.68, 4.3; AOR = 2.81, 95%CI: 1.61, 4.9 respectively), while diabetes AOR = 4.5, 95% CI: 2.43, 8.35) and cardiac problems (AOR = 4.29, 95% CI: 1.17, 15.73) were more likely to be associated with incidence of polypharmacy. In conclusion, chronic use of NSAIDs without gastro-protective agents and therapeutic duplication of NSAIDs were commonly which requires attention from programmers, health facility managers and healthcare professionals to safeguard elderlies from preventable harm."
https://openalex.org/W3092092075,"Objectives The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between maternal primary and recurrent CMV infection during pregnancy, symptoms at birth in the newborn, and long term hearing loss through18 years of age. Patients and methods 237 mother-infant pairs in the Houston, Texas area identified through maternal CMV IgG and IgM antibody serologic screening and newborn screening using urine CMV culture to identify congenital CMV infection were enrolled in the Houston Congenital CMV Longitudinal Study. Mothers were categorized as having primary or recurrent or unknown maternal CMV infections, and newborns were categorized at birth as having symptomatic or asymptomatic congenital CMV infection, or as uninfected controls. All three newborn groups were followed longitudinally with serial hearing evaluations up to 18 years of age. The relationship between type of maternal CMV infection, newborn classification, and the occurrence of hearing loss over time was determined through Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, life table analysis, and a simulated ascertainment of maternal infection type for the unknown categories. Results Of 77 newborns with symptomatic congenital CMV infection, 12 (16%) of mothers had a primary CMV infection during pregnancy; 4 (5%) had a non-primary infection, and the type of infection in 48 (79%) could not be determined and were classified as unknown type of maternal infection. Fifty Seven (74%) of the 77 symptomatic children had hearing loss by 18 years of age, including 9 of the 12 (75%) who were born to mothers with primary infection and 48 (79%) of the 61 with unknown type of maternal infection. Of the 109 newborns with asymptomatic congenital CMV infection, 51 (47%) were born to mothers with a primary CMV infection during pregnancy, 18 (17%) to mothers with a recurrent infection; and 40 (37%) had unknown type of infection. Of these 109 asymptomatic cases, 22 (20%) developed hearing loss, including 14 out of 51 (28%) of those born to mothers with primary infection, two out of the 18 (11%) born to mothers with recurrent infection, and 6 out of the 40 (15%) to mothers of unknown infection type. Of the 51 uninfected newborn controls, 10 (20%) of mothers had a primary CMV infection during pregnancy, 5 (10%) had a non-primary infection, 10 (20%) were never infected, and 26 (51%) were assigned unknown type of infection. Three controls (6%) developed hearing loss, with 1 being born to a mother with primary infection and 1 to a mother never infected with CMV. Conclusions Both primary and non-primary maternal CMV infections during pregnancy resulted in symptomatic and asymptomatic congenital CMV infection. Symptomatic congenital CMV infection was more likely to occur after primary maternal CMV infection. Sensorineural hearing loss occurred in children born to mothers with both primary and non-primary CMV infections, and in both asymptomatic and symptomatic congenital CMV infection, but was more common after maternal primary infection. Most, but not all, hearing loss in children with cCMV associated hearing loss was first detected within the first year of life."
https://openalex.org/W3091822636,"Rye (Secale cereale L.) responds strongly to changes in heterozygosity with hybrids portraying strong heterosis effect on all developmental and yielding characteristics. In order to achieve the highest potential heterosis effect parental lines must originate from genetically distinct gene pools. Here we report the first comprehensive SNP-based population study of an elite germplasm using fertilization control system for hybrid breeding in rye that is genetically different to the predominating P-type. In total 376 inbred lines from Nordic Seed Germany GmbH were genotyped for 4419 polymorphic SNPs. The aim of this study was to confirm and quantify the genetic separation of parental populations, unveil their genetic characteristics and investigate underlying population structures. Through a palette of complimenting analysis, we confirmed a strong genetic differentiation (FST = 0.332) of parental populations validating the germplasms suitability for hybrid breeding. These were, furthermore, found to diverge considerably in several features with the maternal population portraying a strong population structure characterized by a narrow genetic profile, small effective population size and high genome-wise linkage disequilibrium. We propose that the employed male-sterility system putatively constitutes a population determining parameter by influencing the rate of introducing novel genetic variation to the parental populations. Functional analysis of linkage blocks led to identification of a conserved segment on the distal 4RL chromosomal region annotated to the Rfp3 male-fertility restoration ‘Pampa’ type gene. Findings of our study emphasized the immediate value of comprehensive population studies on elite breeding germplasms as a pre-requisite for application of genomic-based breeding techniques, introgression of novel material and to support breeder decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W3091892875,"Zymomonas mobilis, as an ethanologenic microorganism with many desirable industrial features, faces crucial obstacles in the lignocellulosic ethanol production process. A significant hindrance occurs during the pretreatment procedure that not only produces fermentable sugars but also releases severe toxic compounds. As diverse parts of regulation networks are involved in different aspects of complicated tolerance to inhibitors, we developed ZM4-hfq and ZM4-sigE strains, in which hfq and sigE genes were overexpressed, respectively. ZM4-hfq is a transcription regulator and ZM4-sigE is a transcription factor that are involved in multiple stress responses. In the present work, by overexpressing these two genes, we evaluated their impact on the Z. mobilis tolerance to furfural, acetic acid, and sugarcane bagasse hydrolysates. Both recombinant strains showed increased growth rates and ethanol production levels compared to the parental strain. Under a high concentration of furfural, the growth rate of ZM4-hfq was more inhibited compared to ZM4-sigE. More precisely, fermentation performance of ZM4-hfq revealed that the yield of ethanol production was less than that of ZM4-sigE, because more unused sugar had remained in the medium. In the case of acetic acid, ZM4-sigE was the superior strain and produced four and two-fold more ethanol compared to the parental strain and ZM4-hfq, respectively. Comparison of inhibitor tolerance between single and multiple toxic inhibitors in the fermentation of sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate by ZM4-sigE strain showed similar results. In addition, ethanol production performance was considerably higher in ZM4-sigE as well. Finally, the results of the qPCR analysis suggested that under both furfural and acetic acid treatment experiments, overproduction of both hfq and sigE improves the Z. mobilis tolerance and its ethanol production capability. Overall, our study showed the vital role of the regulatory elements to overcome the obstacles in lignocellulosic biomass-derived ethanol and provide a platform for further improvement by directed evolution or systems metabolic engineering tools."
https://openalex.org/W3092407835,"Objectives Endoscopic transpapillary gallbladder drainage (ETGBD) has been proposed as an alternative to surgery or percutaneous cholecystostomy in patients with acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC). We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ETGBD via endoscopic transpapillary gallbladder stenting (ETGBS) or endoscopic naso-gallbladder drainage (ENGBD) as either a bridging or a definitive treatment option for patients with ACC when a cholecystectomy is delayed or cannot be performed. Methods From July 2014 to December 2018, 171 patients with ACC in whom ETGBD were attempted were retrospectively reviewed. The technical and clinical success rates and adverse events were evaluated. Moreover, the predictive factors for technical success and the stent patency in the ETGBS group with high surgical risk were examined. Results The technical and clinical success rates by intention-to-treat analysis for ETGBD were 90.6% (155/171) and 90.1% (154/171), respectively. Visible cystic duct on cholangiography were significant technical success predictor (adjusted odds ratio: 7.099, 95% confidence interval: 1.983-25.407, P = 0.003) as per logistic regression analysis. Adverse events occurred in 12.2% of patients (21/171: mild pancreatitis, n = 9; acute cholangitis, n = 6; post-endoscopic sphincterotomy bleeding, n = 4; and stent migration, n = 1; ACC recurrence, n = 1), but all patients were treated with conservative management and endoscopic treatment. Among the ETGBS group, the median stent patency in 70 patients with high surgical risk was 503 days (interquartile range: 404.25-775 days). Conclusions ETGBD, using either ETGBS or ENGBD, may be a suitable bridging option for ACC patients unfit for urgent cholecystectomy. In high surgical risk patients, ETGBS may be a promising and useful treatment modality with low ACC recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W3091796029,"The ecdysteroid and sesquiterpenoid pathways control growth, developmental transition, and embryogenesis in insects. However, the function of orthologous genes and the cross-talk between both pathways remain largely uncharacterized in non-insect arthropods. Spook (Spo) and Juvenile hormone acid o-methyltransferase (Jhamt) have been suggested to function as rate-limiting factors in ecdysteroid and sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis, respectively, in insects. In this study, we report on the functions of Spo and Jhamt and the cross-talk between them in embryos of the branchiopod crustacean Daphnia magna. Spo expression was activated at the onset of gastrulation, with the depletion of Spo transcript by RNAi resulting in developmental arrest at this stage. This phenotype could be partially rescued by supplementation with 20-hydroxyecdysone, indicating that Spo may play the same role in ecdysteroid biosynthesis in early embryos, as reported in insects. After hatching, Spo expression was repressed, while Jhamt expression was activated transiently, despite its silencing during other embryonic stages. Jhamt RNAi showed little effect on survival, but shortened the embryonic period. Exposure to the sesquiterpenoid analog Fenoxycarb extended the embryonic period and rescued the Jhamt RNAi phenotype, demonstrating a previously unidentified role of sesquiterpenoid in the repression of precocious embryogenesis. Interestingly, the knockdown of Jhamt resulted in the derepression of ecdysteroid biosynthesis genes, including Spo, similar to regulation during insect hormonal biosynthesis. Sesquiterpenoid signaling via the Methoprene-tolerant gene was found to be responsible for the repression of ecdysteroid biosynthesis genes. It upregulated an ortholog of CYP18a1 that degrades ecdysteroid in insects. These results illuminate the conserved and specific functions of the ecdysteroid and sesquiterpenoid pathways in Daphnia embryos. We also infer that the common ancestor of branchiopod crustaceans and insects exhibited antagonism between the two endocrine hormones before their divergence 400 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W3092237475,"Accurate and sensitive quantification of rebound competent HIV that persists despite combination antiretroviral treatment (cART), including in latently infected cells (i.e., viral reservoir), is critical for evaluating cure strategies for decreasing or eliminating this reservoir. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected Rhesus macaques are an important non-human primate (NHP) system for studying potential cure strategies as they model many key aspects of human HIV-infection including the persistence of a latent viral reservoir in resting memory CD4+ T cells in animals receiving prolonged cART. In this report, we describe the design and testing of a sensitive SIV droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay through exploring the combination and optimization of different probe systems (including single, double quencher probes and minor groove binder (MGB) probes) and reaction conditions to eliminate background signal(s), ensure distinct target signal cluster separation from non-target signals, and enable detection and quantification of low level authentic target signals. Similar reaction conditions and assay validation procedures can be explored for potential development of additional assays for other applications that require sensitive detection of low-level targets in a large background of nucleic acid input derived from cell or tissue sources."
https://openalex.org/W3092346206,"Background Understanding patient satisfaction with pharmacy services can help to enhance the quality and monitoring of pharmacy services. Patient Satisfaction with Pharmacist Services Questionnaire 2.0 (PSPSQ 2.0) is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring patient satisfaction with services from the pharmacist. The availability of the PSPSQ 2.0 in Nepalese version would facilitate patient satisfaction and enhance pharmacy services in Nepal. This study aims to translate the PSPSQ 2.0 into the Nepalese version, culturally adapt it and verify its reliability and validity in the Nepalese population. Methods The methodological and cross-sectional study design was used to translate, culturally adapt it, and validate PSPSQ 2.0 in Nepalese. The Nepalese version of PSPSQ 2.0 went through the full linguistic validation process and was evaluated in 300 patients visiting different community pharmacies in Kathmandu district, Nepal. Exploratory factor analysis was carried out using principal component analysis with varimax rotation, and Cronbach's alpha was used to evaluate the reliability. Results Three-hundred patients were recruited in this study. Participants ranged in age from 21 to 83 years; mean age was 53.93 years (SD: 15.21). 62% were females, and 34% educational level was above 12 and university level. Only 7% of the participants were illiterate. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkinwas found to be 0.696, and Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant with a chi-square test value of 3695.415. A principal axis factor analysis conducted on the 20 items with orthogonal rotation (varimax). PSPSQ 2.0 Nepalese version (20 items) had a good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.758). Item-total correlations were reviewed for the items in each of the three domains of PSPSQ 2.0. Conclusion The PSPSQ 2.0 Nepalese version demonstrated acceptable validity and reliability, which can be used in the Nepalese population for evaluating the satisfaction of patients with pharmacist services in both community pharmacy and research."
https://openalex.org/W3092093333,"Biases perpetuate when people think that they are innocent whereas others are guilty of biases. We examined whether people would detect biased thinking and behavior in others but not themselves as influenced by preexisting beliefs (myside bias) and social stigmas (social biases). The results of three large studies showed that, across demographic groups, participants attributed more biases to others than to themselves, and that this self-other asymmetry was particularly salient among those who hold strong beliefs about the existence of biases (Study 1 and Study 2). The self-other asymmetry in bias recognition dissipated when participants made simultaneous predictions about others’ and their own thoughts and behaviors (Study 3). People thus exhibit bias in bias recognition, and this metacognitive bias may be remedied when it is highlighted to people that we are all susceptible to biasing influences."
https://openalex.org/W3092248866,"Background Clinical inertia can lead to poor glycemic control among type 2 diabetes patients. However, there is paucity of information on clinical inertia in low- and middle-income countries including Malaysia. This study aimed to determine the time to treatment intensification among T2D patients with HbA1c of ≥7% (≥53 mmol/mol) in Malaysian public health clinics. The proportion of patients with treatment intensification and its associated factors were also determined. Material and methods This was a five-year retrospective open cohort study using secondary data from the National Diabetes Registry. The study setting was all public health clinics (n = 47) in the state of Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. Time to treatment intensification was defined as the number of years from the index year until the addition of another oral antidiabetic drug or initiation of insulin. Life table survival analysis based on best-worst case scenarios was used to determine the time to treatment intensification. Discrete-time proportional hazards model was fitted for the factors associated with treatment intensification. Results The mean follow-up duration was 2.6 (SD 1.1) years. Of 7,646 patients, the median time to treatment intensification was 1.29 years (15.5 months), 1.58 years (19.0 months) and 2.32 years (27.8 months) under the best-, average- and worst-case scenarios respectively. The proportion of patients with treatment intensification was 45.4% (95% CI: 44.2–46.5), of which 34.6% occurred only after one year. Younger adults, overweight, obesity, use of antiplatelet medications and poorer HbA1c were positively associated with treatment intensification. Patients treated with more oral antidiabetics were less likely to have treatment intensification. Conclusion Clinical inertia is present in the management of T2D patients in Malaysian public health clinics. We recommend further studies in lower- and middle-income countries to explore its causes so that targeted strategies can be developed to address this issue."

Gasoline station workers are exposed to a mixture of hydrocarbons during dispensing. However, no published studies investigated the liver and renal function tests of gasoline station workers in Ethiopia. Therefore the aim of this study was to assess liver and renal function tests among gasoline station workers.A comparative cross sectional study was conduct from January 2018 to April 2018 at Mekelle city, Tigray region, Northern Ethiopia. Liver and renal function tests were analyzed on gasoline exposed (n = 43) and controls (n = 47) by Pentra C400 automated clinical chemistry analyzer. Student independent t-test and one way-ANOVA statistical methods were employed using SPSS Ver23. P-value < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.The mean level of ALT, AST, Urea, creatinine, and uric acid was significantly higher among gasoline stations workers when compared to control study participants. There was also a significant increase in ALT, AST, Urea, creatinine and uric acid among gasoline stations with above 6 years exposure when compared with those exposed for ≤2 and3-6years.These findings suggest that increasing liver and renal parameters may be associated with exposure to gasoline and it is dependent on time of exposure to gasoline."
https://openalex.org/W3092087789,"This observational study analyzed the performance of the National TB Control Program (NTP) in Afghanistan in household contact screening from 2011 to 2018 and its use as an entry point for isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), as well as the IPT completion rates for children under age five.From 2011 to 2018, the Afghanistan NTP released guidelines for passive and active contact screening of bacteriologically confirmed TB cases. Health workers were trained in contact screening. Presumptive TB cases gave sputum for AFB smear microscopy; other diagnostics were used if patients could not produce sputum. Children under five (excluding those with active TB) were treated for latent TB infection. We calculated the yield and the number needed to screen and number needed to test to find a case of TB, as well as the rates of IPT initiation and completion.From 2011 to 2018, 142,797 bacteriologically confirmed TB cases were diagnosed in Afghanistan. The number of household members eligible for screening was estimated to be 856,782, of whom 586,292 (81%) were screened for TB and 117,643 (20.1%) were found to be presumptive TB cases. Among the cases screened, 10,896 TB cases (all forms) were diagnosed (1.85%, 95% CI 1.82-1.89), 54.4% in females. The number needed to screen to diagnose a single case of TB (all forms) was 53.8; the number needed to test was 10.7. Out of all children under five, 101,084 (85.9%) were initiated on IPT, and 69,273 (68.5%) completed treatment.Program performance in contact screening in Afghanistan is high, at 81%, and the yield of TB is also high-close to 10 times higher than the national TB incidence rate. IPT initiation and completion rates are also high as compared to those of many other countries but need further improvement, especially for completion."
https://openalex.org/W3091823442,"The clinical course of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is related to choroidal conditions, and can be determined by the evaluation of the central choroidal thickness (CCT). The aim of this study was to determine the association between the axial length (AL) and choroidal thickness in AMD by measuring these parameters in patients with and without AMD. Seventy eyes of 70 patients (34 men and 36 women; age, 64–88 years; mean age, 77.0 ± 6.5 years) who underwent cataract surgery from February 2015 to March 2020 at the Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine were retrospectively analyzed. The AMD group (29 patients, 29 eyes) included eyes with early AMD, whereas the control group (41 patients, 41 eyes) included those without ocular diseases other than cataract. Optical coherence tomography images were used to measure the CCT and the choroidal vessel diameter (CVD). The IOL Master was used to measure the AL. The results revealed that mean CCT was greater in the AMD group (238.3 ± 108.3 μm) compared with the age-matched control group (187.2 ± 66.8 μm) (p = 0.03). The CCT was negatively correlated with AL in the overall sample (r = -0.42, p = 0.001), the AMD group (r = -0.42, p = 0.02), and the control group (r = -0.42, p = 0.006). Note that all eyes with CCT > 350 μm were included in the AMD group. CCT and CVD were positively correlated in the overall sample (r = 0.76, p < 0.001) as well as in the individual groups (AMD: r = 0.82, p < 0.001; control: r = 0.76, p = 0.004). Given that CCT is an important parameter for predicting the prognosis of subfoveal diseases, routine evaluation of AL may be valuable for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AMD."
https://openalex.org/W3092095679,"Our understanding of animal adaptations to human pressure is limited by the focus on rare taxa, despite that common species are more significant in shaping structure, function and service provision of ecosystems. Thus better understanding of their ecology and behavioural adjustments is central for drafting conservation actions. In this study, we used radio-telemetry on 21 individuals (10 females, 11 males) to provide data on spatial ecology, habitat selection and use of roosts of one of the commonest species, the whiskered bat (Myotis mystacinus), inhabiting the Carpathian Mountains (southern Poland). We tested, whether this species prefers natural over human-modified landscapes to seek prey and roosts. Mean home range size of the whiskered bat in the Carpathian Mountains was 26.3 ha (SE ± 3.2, Local Convex Hull) and 110 ha (SE ± 22.1, Minimum Convex Polygon with all locations), and included between one and three patches, among which bats moved along linear environmental features, such as scrubby banks of streams or lines of trees. During foraging whiskered bats selected small woodlands within agricultural landscapes, avoided large mountain forests and open areas, and used built-up areas proportionally to their availability. Whiskered bats occupied roosts located mainly in buildings (>97%), at an average altitude of 547.9 m above sea level (SE ± 8.3). Roosts were used for 5.4 days, on average. Our study shows that whiskered bats adapted well to the mosaic of semi-natural and anthropogenic habitats. It highlights the importance of buildings serving as roosts and small woodlands used as foraging areas in human-dominated montane landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W3092120020,"University students are at significantly higher risk of serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) infection, which can result in debilitating sequelae and excessive healthcare usage. This study aimed to elucidate the impact of universal pre-enrollment vaccination on MenB outbreak probability and the cost-effectiveness in outbreak-only scenarios.We developed an infectious disease transmission model to determine the number of outbreaks averted under universal vaccination and a Markov model to simulate the costs accrued and QALYs lost associated with infection. The analysis was done on a hypothetical population of 40,000 college students over a four-year time frame. We used the outputs of these two models to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of universal MenB vaccination from a societal perspective.We find that the vaccination strategy was estimated to reduce MenB incidence by 63% and outbreak frequency rate by 90%. Under base case assumptions, the ICER of universal vaccination was $748,129 per QALY and in outbreak-only scenarios, it was cost-saving.Universal vaccination is not cost-effective at the current low MenB incidence levels and vaccine price in the U.S., but it is cost-saving if outbreak is imminent."

The Affordable Care Act sought to redress this gap by including substance use treatments as essential health benefits under new plans offered. This study used data from 11,732 privately insured adult participants of the 2005–2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health with drug use disorders to examine trends in drug use treatment coverage and the association of coverage with receiving treatment. 37.6% of the participants with drug use disorders did not know whether their plan covered drug use treatment, with little change over time. Among those who knew, coverage increased modestly between the 2005–2013 and 2014–2018 periods (73.5% vs. 77.5%, respectively, p = .015). Coverage was associated with receiving drug use treatment (adjusted odds ratio = 2.09, 95% confidence interval = 1.61–2.72, p < .001). However, even among participants with coverage, only 13.4% received treatment. Broader coverage of drug use treatment could potentially improve treatment rates."
https://openalex.org/W3091976495,"Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is considered as risk factor for the development of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. However, dynamics of cognitive functions are subtle, and neurocognitive assessments largely differ in detecting these changes. We aimed to develop and evaluate a score which represents the common aspects of the cognitive functions measured by validated tests (i.e., ""general cognitive construct""), while reducing overlap between tests and be more sensitive to identify changes in overall cognitive functioning.We developed the CoCo (cognitive construct) score to reflect the cognitive performance obtained by all items of four neurocognitive assessments (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); Trail Making Test; Semantic Fluency, animals; Digital Symbol Substitution Test). The sample comprised 2,415 AF patients from the Swiss Atrial Fibrillation Cohort Study (Swiss-AF), 87% aged at least 65 years. Psychometric statistics were calculated for two cognitive measures based on (i) the full set of items from the neurocognitive test battery administered in the Swiss-AF study (i.e., CoCo item set) and (ii) the items from the widely used MoCA test. For the CoCo item set, a factor score was derived based on a principal component analysis, and its measurement properties were analyzed.Both the MoCA item set and the full neurocognitive test battery revealed good psychometric properties, especially the full battery. A one-factor model with good model fit and performance across time and groups was identified and used to generate the CoCo score, reflecting for each patient the common cognitive skill performance measured across the full neurocognitive test battery. The CoCo score showed larger effect sizes compared to the MoCA score in relation to relevant clinical variables.The derived factor score allows summarizing AF patients' cognitive performance as a single score. Using this score in the Swiss-AF project increases measurement sensitivity and decreases the number of statistical tests needed, which will be helpful in future studies addressing how AF affects the risk of developing cognitive impairment."
https://openalex.org/W3092172480,"While many aspects of the growth of maize are well understood, the role of cell wall feruloylation particularly during internode elongation has not been firmly established, but results so far indicate that it has significant implications for both biofuel feedstock conversion and for crop yield. The growth of the cell wall is achieved by synthesis, integration and cross-linking between wall polymers. As ferulate oxidative coupling of arabinoxylan side chains constitutes a significant type of cross-link in grass cell walls, it is expected to have a crucial role in plant growth. Making use of plants expressing an apoplast targeted Aspergillus niger FAEA under the control of either a constitutive or an inducible promoter, the role of cell wall feruloylation in maize internode expansion was investigated. Analysis of FAEA expressing plants showed that where FAEA was targeted to the apoplast under a constitutive promoter, plants varied in stature either from semi-dwarf plants with a 40–60% height reduction, to extreme dwarf mutants with over 90% reduction in plant heights compared to controls. Results indicate that disruption of cell wall feruloylation by FAEA occurs before the start of rapid internode expansion is initiated and affects the normal course of internode elongation, resulting in short internodes and dwarfed plants. In contrast, when under the inducible Lm See1 senescence promoter, FAEA activity was found to be low up to the VT stage of development but increased significantly at the VR stage as plants began to senesce, strongly suggesting that normal cell wall feruloylation is required for the process of internode expansion. In addition, with apoplast targeted expression of FAEA under control of the senescence enhanced promoter it was possible to demonstrate decreased cell wall feruloylation without affecting internode expansion or other aspects of plant development."
https://openalex.org/W3092549774,"The association of socioeconomic status and lifestyle behaviours on mental health appears well-established in the literature, as several studies report that better socioeconomic status such as higher levels of disposable income and employment as well as practising healthy lifestyles can enhance mental well-being. However, the reliance on cross-sectional correlations and lack of adequate statistical controls are possible limitations. This study aims to add the evidence of longitudinal association to the literature by using Japanese representative longitudinal household panel data. We employed panel data analytical techniques such as the random-effects conditional logistic regression (RE-CLR) and the fixed-effects conditional logistic regression (FE-CLR) models with possible time variant confounders being controlled. Our sample was comprised of 14,717 observations of 3,501 individuals aged 22–59 years for five waves of the Japanese Household Panel Survey. We confirmed many of the factors associated with mental health reported in existing studies by analysing cross-sectional data. These significant associations are also longitudinal (within) associations estimated by the FE-CLR models. Such factors include unemployment, low household income, short nightly sleeping duration, and lack of exercise. However, we also found that several factors such as disposable income, living alone, and drinking habits are not significantly associated with mental health in the FE-CRL models. The results imply the reverse causality that poor mental health conditions cause lower disposal income, possibly due to the inability to exhibit higher productivity, but an increase in disposal income would not necessarily improve mental health conditions. In this case, aggressive policy interventions to increase the disposal income of people of lower socioeconomic backgrounds would not necessarily be effective to minimize health inequalities."

Additionally, anticoagulant properties have been suggested recently. EP, therefore, is a potentially antiatherosclerotic drug. We aimed to investigate whether EP possesses antiplatelet and anticoagulant properties particularly in the physiological environment of whole blood. Methods We investigated the effects of increasing concentrations of EP on platelet function, on the course of clot development, and on standard coagulation times. Additionally, clot ultrastructure using scanning electron microscopy was analysed. Results EP exerted significant antiplatelet actions: i) Impedance aggregometry amplitudes (11.7 ± 3.0 ohm, 0 μg/mL EP) dose dependently decreased (7.8 ± 3.1 ohm, 1000 μg/mL EP; -33.3%). ATP exocytosis (0.87 ± 0.24 nM, 0 μg/mL EP) measured by the luminiscent method dose-dependently decreased (0.56 ± 0.14 nM, 1000 μg/mL; -35.6%). ii) Closure times (104.4 ± 23.8 s, 0 μg/mL EP) using the Platelet function analyzer were dose-dependently prolonged (180.5 ± 82.5 s, 1000 μg/mL EP; +72.9%) using membranes coated with collagen/ADP. iii) Surface coverage (15.9 ± 5.1%, 0 μg/mL EP) dose-dependently decreased (9.0 ± 3.7%, 1000 μg/mL EP; -43.4%) using the Cone and Platelet analyzer. EP also exerted significant anticoagulant actions: Coagulation times (177.9 ± 37.8, 0 μg/mL EP) evaluated by means of thrombelastometry were dose-dependently prolonged (212.8 ± 57.7 s, 1000 μg/mL EP; +19.6%). Activated partial thromboplastin times (31.5 ± 1.8 s, 0 μg/mL EP) were dose-dependently prolonged (35.6 ± 2.3 s, 1000 μg/mL EP; +13.0%). Prothrombin times (0.94 ± 0.02 INR, 0 μg/mL EP) were dose-dependently prolonged (1.09 ± 0.04 INR, 1000 μg/mL EP; +16.0%). Conclusion We found that EP possesses antiplatelet and anticoagulant properties in whole blood. Together with its proven anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, EP is a potentially antiatherogenic drug."

For that purpose, we built a large eye tracking dataset composed of 150 paintings belonging to 5 art movements. We observed that the gaze deployment over the proposed paintings was very similar to the gaze deployment over natural scenes. Therefore, we evaluate existing saliency models and propose a new one which significantly outperforms the most recent deep-based saliency models. Thanks to this new saliency model, we can predict very accurately what are the salient areas of a painting. This opens new avenues for many image-based applications such as animation of paintings or transformation of a still painting into a video clip."
https://openalex.org/W3092092578,"The aim of this work was to use TOPAS Monte Carlo simulations to model the effect of magnetic fields on dose distributions in brachytherapy lung treatments, under ideal and clinical conditions. Idealistic studies were modeled consisting of either a monoenergetic electron source of 432 keV, or a polyenergetic electron source using the spectrum of secondary electrons produced by 192Ir gamma-ray irradiation. The electron source was positioned in the center of a homogeneous, lung tissue phantom (ρ = 0.26 g/cm3). Conversely, the clinical study was simulated using the VariSource VS2000 192Ir source in a patient with a lung tumor. Three contoured volumes were considered: the tumor, the planning tumor volume (PTV), and the lung. In all studies, dose distributions were calculated in the presence or absence of a constant magnetic field of 3T. Also, TG-43 parameters were calculated for the VariSource and compared with published data from EGS-brachy (EGSnrc) and PENELOPE. The magnetic field affected the dose distributions in the idealistic studies. For the monoenergetic and poly-energetic studies, the radial distance of the 10% iso-dose line was reduced in the presence of the magnetic field by 64.9% and 24.6%, respectively. For the clinical study, the magnetic field caused differences of 10% on average in the patient dose distributions. Nevertheless, differences in dose-volume histograms were below 2%. Finally, for TG-43 parameters, the dose-rate constant from TOPAS differed by 0.09% ± 0.33% and 0.18% ± 0.33% with respect to EGS-brachy and PENELOPE, respectively. The geometry and anisotropy functions differed within 1.2% ± 1.1%, and within 0.0% ± 0.3%, respectively. The Lorentz forces inside a 3T magnetic resonance machine during 192Ir brachytherapy treatment of the lung are not large enough to affect the tumor dose distributions significantly, as expected. Nevertheless, large local differences were found in the lung tissue. Applications of this effect are therefore limited by the fact that meaningful differences appeared only in regions containing air, which is not abundant inside the human."
https://openalex.org/W3092166279,"Ocean warming, ocean acidification and overfishing are major threats to the structure and function of marine ecosystems. Driven by increasing anthropogenic emissions of CO2, ocean warming is leading to global redistribution of marine biota and altered ecosystem dynamics, while ocean acidification threatens the ability of calcifying marine organisms to form skeletons due to decline in saturation state of carbonate Ω and pH. In Tasmania, the interaction between overfishing of sea urchin predators and rapid ocean warming has caused a phase-shift from productive kelp beds to overgrazed sea urchin barren grounds, however potential impacts of ocean acidification on this system have not been considered despite this threat for marine ecosystems globally. Here we use automated loggers and point measures of pH, spanning kelp beds and barren grounds, to reveal that kelp beds have the capacity to locally ameliorate effects of ocean acidification, via photosynthetic drawdown of CO2, compared to unvegetated barren grounds. Based on meta-analysis of anticipated declines in physiological performance of grazing urchins to decreasing pH and assumptions of nil adaptation, future projection of OA across kelp-barrens transition zones reveals that kelp beds could act as important pH refugia, with urchins potentially becoming increasingly challenged at distances >40 m from kelp beds. Using spatially explicit simulation of physicochemical feedbacks between grazing urchins and their kelp prey, we show a stable mosaicked expression of kelp patches to emerge on barren grounds. Depending on the adaptative capacity of sea urchins, future declines in pH appear poised to further alter phase-shift dynamics for reef communities; thus, assessing change in spatial-patterning of reef-scapes may indicate cascading ecological impacts of ocean acidification."
https://openalex.org/W3092311370,"Biological organisms respond to environmental stressors by recruiting multiple cellular cascades that act to mitigate damage and ultimately enhance survival. This implies that compounds that interact with any of those pathways might improve organism's survival. Here, we report on an initial attempt to develop a drug screening assay based on the heat shock (HS) response of Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes. The protocol works by subjecting the worms to two HS conditions in the absence/presence of the test compounds. Post-heat shock survival is quantified manually or in semi-automatic manner by analyzing z-stack pictures. We blindly screened a cassette of 72 compounds in different developmental stages provided by Eli Lilly through their Open Innovation Drug Discovery program. The analysis indicated that, on average, therapeutically useful drugs increase survival to HS compared to compounds used in non-clinical settings. We developed a formalism that estimates the probability of a compound to enhance survival based on a comparison with a set of parameters calculated from a pool of 35 FDA-approved drugs. The method correctly identified the developmental stages of the Lilly compounds based on their relative abilities to enhance survival to the HS. Taken together these data provide proof of principle that an assay that measures the HS response of C. elegans can offer physiological and pharmacological insight in a cost- and time-efficient manner."

In order to better understand the aroma enhancement potential of Oenococcus oeni SD-2a, β-D-glucosidase (βG) activities in the culture supernatant, whole cells, and disrupted cell lysate were assessed at mid log, late log and stationary growth phase. The enzymatic activity was also compared further from cell cultures with 5 different carbon sources (glucose, cellobiose, arbutin, glucose and cellobiose, glucose and arbutin) at late log phase. Correspondingly, expression levels of 3 bgl genes, OEOE-0224, OEOE-1210, and OEOE-1569 were investigated from cell cultures of the 3 growth phases, and the 5 cell cultures with different carbon sources. Finally, the volatile aroma compounds released by O. oeni SD-2a in synthetic wines with natural glycosides were evaluated by GC-MS. Results showed βG of O. oeni SD-2a was not extracellular enzyme, and the location of it didn’t change with the change of growth phase and carbon source studied. βG activities in the whole cells and disrupted cell lysate were similar and constant at the 3 growth phases. As for the carbon sources, βG activities of whole cells and disrupted lysate were positively affected by cellobiose. While arbutin displayed positive and negative effect on βG activity of whole cells and disrupted lysate, respectively. It is probably that bgl genes OEOE-0224 and OEOE-1210 were related to βG activity of SD-2a whole cells, while OEOE-1569 was responsible for βG activity of disrupted lysate. More kinds of volatile compounds and higher total concentration were released by SD-2a in synthetic wine compared with control.

Alignment of prevention and care continua is essential to further improve health outcomes and minimize HIV transmission risk.Cross-sectional study.Data from 977 persons who inject drugs (PWID) collected in 2011-2016 in Tallinn, Estonia, were used to construct an HIV PCC for PWID, stratified by risk for acquiring or transmitting HIV infection and by coverage of combined interventions. We also estimated the average protective effect of current levels of intervention provision.74.4%, 20.3% and 35.2% of PWID were currently using needle and syringe programmes (NSP), drug treatment and HIV testing, respectively. 51.1% of current PWID were HIV seropositive and of those 62.5% were currently on ART and 19.0% were virally suppressed. Across the PCC, individuals moved between categories of being aware and ever using drug treatment (resulting in -50% ""leakage""); from ever having used to currently using drug treatment (-59%); between ""ever testing"" and ""current (continuous) testing"" (-62%); and from self-reported antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence to viral suppression (-70%). Use of prevention services was higher among those at risk of transmission (HIV positive). The overall reduction in acquisition risk among HIV-negative PWID was 77.7% (95% CrI 67.8-84.5%), estimated by the modelled protective effects of current levels of NSP, drug treatment and ART compared to none of these services.Our findings suggest that developing a cohesive model for HIV prevention and treatment is feasible and reflects the bi-directional relationships between prevention and care. The integrated continuum model indicates the major factors which may predict the epidemic course and control response."
https://openalex.org/W3092455354,"A morphologically unusual Cryptini, Cryptoxenodon gen. nov. Supeleto, Santos & Aguiar, is described and illustrated, with a single species, C. metamorphus sp. nov. Supeleto, Santos & Aguiar, apparently occurring in two disjunct populations in northern and southeastern South America. The highly dimorphic female and male are described and illustrated. The phylogenetic relationships of the new genus are investigated using a matrix with 308 other species of Cryptini in 182 genera, based on 109 morphological characters and molecular data from seven loci. The analyses clearly support Cryptoxenodon gen. nov. as a distinct genus, closest to Debilos Townes and Diapetimorpha Viereck. Species limits and definition are investigated, but despite much morphological variation the analyses at the specimen level do not warrant the division of the studied populations into separate species. The considerable morphological variation is explored with principal component analyses of mixed features, and a new procedure is proposed for objective analysis of colors. The relationship of color and structural variation with altitude and latitude is demonstrated and discussed, representing an important case study for Ichneumonidae. Externally, Cryptoxenodon gen. nov. can be recognized mainly by its unusually large mandibles, but other diagnostic features include clypeus wide; sternaulus complete, distinct and crenulate throughout; areolet closed, about as long as pterostigma width; petiole anteriorly with distinct triangular projection on each side, spiracle near posterior 0.25; propodeum without posterior transverse carina; and propodeal apophyses conspicuously projected."
https://openalex.org/W3092631507,"Introduction Worldwide, 25 million unsafe abortions (45% of all abortions) occurred every year between 2010 and 2014 and 97%, occurred in low-and-middle income countries. Abortion among adolescent girls and young women (15–24 years) is a major public health issue, especially in low-and middle-income countries, including Ghana. Using data from the 2017 Maternal Health Survey, we sought to examine the association between mass media exposure and adolescent girls and young women’s self-efficacy in abortion decision making. Materials and methods A sample of 5,664 adolescent girls and young women in Ghana was considered in this study. Both descriptive and inferential analytical approaches were employed to analyse the data. The descriptive analytical approach involved the use of proportions to illustrate the proportion of adolescent girls and young women who had self-efficacy in abortion decision-making. Self-efficacy in abortion decision-making was derived from the question ‘Could you decide on your own to get an abortion?’ Respondents who answered “Yes” to this question were considered as having self-efficacy in abortion decision making. At the inferential level, a chi-square test and bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were employed with statistical significance pegged at p-value <0.05. The results of the bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were presented using crude and adjusted odds ratios respectively. Results Less than a quarter of adolescent girls and young women (24%) in Ghana had self-efficacy in abortion decision-making. We further found that adolescent girls and young women who were exposed to mass media had higher odds in self-efficacy in abortion decision-making compared to those who were not exposed to the mass media [AOR = 1.55, CI = 1.14–2.11]. It was also found that adolescent girls and young women aged 20–24 [AOR = 1.45, CI = 1.25–1.68], those who were cohabiting [AOR = 1.40, CI = 1.02–1.93], and those from the Ashanti region [AOR = 2.39, CI = 1.85–3.07] had higher odds on self-efficacy in abortion decision-making. On the other hand, adolescent girls and young women from the Eastern Region [AOR = 0.52, CI = 0.36–0.73] and those belonging to the Ga-Adangbe ethnic group [AOR = 0.70, CI = 0.50–0.99] had lower odds in self-efficacy in abortion decision-making. Conclusion Less than a quarter of adolescent girls and young women in Ghana have self-efficacy in abortion decision-making which can affect adolescent girls and young women’s future abortion seeking behaviours. Exposure to mass media was strongly associated with self-efficacy in abortion decision making. We recommend that policy makers should promote mass media campaigns scheduled on regular intervals in order to inform the target audience about safe abortions in Ghana. This could go a long way to ensure that cases of unsafe abortions are reduced to the starkest minimum."
https://openalex.org/W3091876843,"The prediction of the liver failure (LF) and its proper diagnosis would lead to a reduction in the complications of the disease and prevents the progress of the disease. To improve the treatment of LF patients and reduce the cost of treatment, we build a machine learning model to forecast whether a patient would deteriorate after admission to the hospital. First, a total of 348 LF patients were included from May 2011 to March 2018 retrospectively in this study. Then, 15 key clinical indicators are selected as the input of the machine learning algorithm. Finally, machine learning and the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) are used to forecast the LF deterioration. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of MELD, GLMs, CART, SVM and NNET with 10 fold-cross validation was 0.670, 0.554, 0.794, 0.853 and 0.912 respectively. Additionally, the accuracy of MELD, GLMs, CART, SVM and NNET was 0.669, 0.456, 0.794, 0.853 and 0.912. The predictive performance of the developed machine model execept the GLMs exceeds the classic MELD model. The machine learning method could support the physicians to trigger the initiation of timely treatment for the LD patients."
https://openalex.org/W3091984593,"Purpose We aimed to examine whether the number of previous hospitalizations and the main diagnoses of those hospitalizations are associated with increased in-hospital hip fracture mortality for older people. That assessment is relevant because if those variables are shown to be associated with increased mortality, that finding could support their use as proxies for comorbidity burden for case-mix adjustment in statistical models seeking to compare the performance of hospitals regarding hip fracture mortality in settings with limited hospital information systems. Methods In this retrospective cohort study of all public hospital admissions for older adults with hip fractures in the city of Rio de Janeiro between 2010 and 2011, we used data from the Hospital Admission Information System database to examine the association between in-hospital mortality and the number of hospitalizations in the previous two years and their main diagnoses through logistic regression. Results Among 1938 patients included in the study there were 103 (5.3%) in-hospital deaths. Although the presence of hospitalization episodes within the two years preceding the index hip fracture was associated with increased mortality (OR: 1.78, 95%CI: 1.07 to 2.97) we did not find evidence of a gradient of increased mortality with a growing number of previous hospitalizations. Additionally, several diseases recorded as main diagnoses of previous hospitalizations were not associated with increased mortality rates, as was expected based on existing knowledge on risk factors for decreased survival in older adults with hip fractures. Conclusions Our results suggest that, in settings where local hospital information systems have limited access to secondary diagnoses, the use of the number of previous hospitalizations or the main diagnoses associated with those hospitalizations as proxies for the profile of comorbidities of older adults with hip fractures may not be an effective way to adjust for case-mix when comparing in-hospital mortality rates among hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W3092151275,"Public value is gaining prominence from both academics and politicians with regards to China's rural development. However, rural planning authorities and practitioners showed limited confidence on public, which manifests as few public perceptions were integrated into the planning documents. This study explores the potential role of residents' experiences in illustrating local economic development within the context of coastal villages in which economic and industries are rapidly transforming. Two case studies from within the locale of the Greater Hangzhou Bay Rim Area are used in this article to examine the gap between residents' experiences and the actual economic development that has occurred. The main findings suggest that rural residents can directly reflect upon both current and historic trends of local economic development. Moreover, household income satisfaction (HIS) is a comprehensive notion of residents' experiences, and indicates social and economic sustainability of industrial transformation, or thriving business, that have been highlighted in coastal villages. Public experiences could therefore act as a valid and accessible evidence for planners in rural economic planning in China and other developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W3092249587,"Changes in gene expression can correlate with poor disease outcomes in two ways: through changes in relative transcript levels or through alternative RNA splicing leading to changes in relative abundance of individual transcript isoforms. The objective of this research is to develop new statistical methods in detecting and analyzing both differentially expressed and spliced isoforms, which appropriately account for the dependence between isoforms and multiple testing corrections for the multi-dimensional structure of at both the gene- and isoform- level. We developed a linear mixed effects model-based approach for analyzing the complex alternative RNA splicing regulation patterns detected by whole-transcriptome RNA-sequencing technologies. This approach thoroughly characterizes and differentiates three types of genes related to alternative RNA splicing events with distinct differential expression/splicing patterns. We applied the concept of appropriately controlling for the gene-level overall false discovery rate (OFDR) in this multi-dimensional alternative RNA splicing analysis utilizing a two-step hierarchical hypothesis testing framework. In the initial screening test we identify genes that have differentially expressed or spliced isoforms; in the subsequent confirmatory testing stage we examine only the isoforms for genes that have passed the screening tests. Comparisons with other methods through application to a whole transcriptome RNA-Seq study of adenoid cystic carcinoma and extensive simulation studies have demonstrated the advantages and improved performances of our method. Our proposed method appropriately controls the gene-level OFDR, maintains statistical power, and is flexible to incorporate advanced experimental designs."
https://openalex.org/W3092356671,"In the EMO (evolutionary multi-objective, EMO) algorithm, MaOPs (many objective optimization problems, MaOPs) are sometimes difficult to keep the balance of convergence and diversity. The decomposition based EMO developed for MaOPs has been proved to be effective, and BBO/Complex (the biogeography based optimization for complex system, BBO/Complex) algorithm is a low complexity algorithm. In this paper, a decomposition and adaptive weight adjustment based BBO/Complex algorithm (DAWA-BBO/Complex) for MaOPs is proposed. First, a new method based on crowding distance is designed to generate a set of weight vectors with good uniformly. Second, an adaptive weight adjustment method is used to solve MaOPs with complex Pareto optimal front. Subsystem space obtains a non-dominated solution by a new selection strategy. The experimental results show that the algorithm is superior to other new algorithms in terms of convergence and diversity in DTLZ benchmark problems. Finally, the algorithm is used to solve the problem of NC (numerical control machine, NC) cutting parameters, and the final optimization result is obtained by AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process, AHP) method. The results show that the cutting speed is 10.8m/min, back cutting depth is 0.13mm, the cutting time is 504s and the cutting cost is 22.15yuan. The proposed algorithm can effectively solve the practical optimization problem."
https://openalex.org/W3092445041,"This study presents an investigation on the effect of shield placement for mitigation of transient voltage in a 33/11 kV, 30 MVA transformer due to Standard Switching Impulse (SSI) and Oscillating Switching Impulse (OSI) surges. Generally, the winding and insulation in transformers could experience severe voltage stress due to the external impulses i.e. switching events. Hence, it is important to examine the voltage stress and identify the mitigation action i.e. shield placements in order to reduce the adverse effect to the transformer windings. First, the resistances, inductances, and capacitances (RLC) were calculated for disc type transformer in order to develop the winding RLC equivalent circuit. The SSI and OSI transient voltage waveforms were applied to the High Voltage (HV) winding whereby the transient voltages were simulated for each disc. The resulting voltage stresses were mitigated through different configurations of electrostatic shield placements. The resonant oscillations generated due to switching surges were analysed through initial voltage distribution. The analyses on the transient voltages of the transformer winding and standard error of the slope (SEb) reveal that the location of shield placement has a significant effect on the resonant switching voltages. The increment of the shield number in the windings does not guarantee optimize mitigation of the resonant switching transient voltages. It is found that the voltage stress along the windings is linear once a floating shield is placed between the HV and Low Voltage (LV) windings of the disc-type transformer under the SSI and OSI waveforms. These findings could assist the manufacturers with appropriate technical basis for mitigation of the transformer winding against the external transient switching overvoltage surges."
