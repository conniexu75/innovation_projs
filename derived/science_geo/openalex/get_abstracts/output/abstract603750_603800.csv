https://openalex.org/W2785187242,"KRASG12C was recently identified to be potentially druggable by allele-specific covalent targeting of Cys-12 in vicinity to an inducible allosteric switch II pocket (S-IIP). Success of this approach requires active cycling of KRASG12C between its active-GTP and inactive-GDP conformations as accessibility of the S-IIP is restricted only to the GDP-bound state. This strategy proved feasible for inhibiting mutant KRAS in vitro; however, it is uncertain whether this approach would translate to in vivo. Here, we describe structure-based design and identification of ARS-1620, a covalent compound with high potency and selectivity for KRASG12C. ARS-1620 achieves rapid and sustained in vivo target occupancy to induce tumor regression. We use ARS-1620 to dissect oncogenic KRAS dependency and demonstrate that monolayer culture formats significantly underestimate KRAS dependency in vivo. This study provides in vivo evidence that mutant KRAS can be selectively targeted and reveals ARS-1620 as representing a new generation of KRASG12C-specific inhibitors with promising therapeutic potential."

Cellular RNA molecules interact with a diverse array of nearly 2,000 RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) (Brannan et al., 2016Brannan K.W. Jin W. Huelga S.C. Banks C.A. Gilmore J.M. Florens L. Washburn M.P. Van Nostrand E.L. Pratt G.A. Schwinn M.K. et al.SONAR discovers RNA-binding proteins from analysis of large-scale protein-protein interactomes.Mol. Cell. 2016; 64: 282-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) to form ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs). Large numbers of RNPs frequently accumulate into microscopically visible RNP granules, which can measure up to several microns in size but remain highly dynamic. Neuronal transport granules, which mediate the transport of mRNA and other cargo along axons and dendrites (Ainger et al., 1993Ainger K. Avossa D. Morgan F. Hill S.J. Barry C. Barbarese E. Carson J.H. Transport and localization of exogenous myelin basic protein mRNA microinjected into oligodendrocytes.J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), are an example of RNP granules that are present in cells under physiological conditions. By contrast, exposure of cells to exogenous stresses can induce the rapid formation of cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) and other induced RNP granules (Kedersha et al., 1999Kedersha N.L. Gupta M. Li W. Miller I. Anderson P. RNA-binding proteins TIA-1 and TIAR link the phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha to the assembly of mammalian stress granules.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). The formation of SGs occurs concurrently with alterations in global RNA metabolism, primarily a near-complete shutdown in translation through sequestration of untranslated mRNAs within stalled translation initiation complexes (Kedersha and Anderson, 2002Kedersha N. Anderson P. Stress granules: sites of mRNA triage that regulate mRNA stability and translatability.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). SG formation has been suggested as a two-step process, with initial formation of a dense stable SG “core” followed by accumulation of proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and low-complexity domains (LCDs) into a peripheral “shell” through a process involving liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) (Jain et al., 2016Jain S.

Recently, SGs have been associated with human neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the presence of toxic insoluble protein aggregates. This link is most compelling in the case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), where numerous disease-causing mutations are purported to interfere with LLPS-dependent growth and dynamics of SGs (Boeynaems et al., 2017Boeynaems S.

A more complete description of how SG composition and behavior are affected in normal and disease conditions is required for the potential development of SG-targeting therapies. A few systematic approaches have been employed to catalog the protein content of SGs (Buchan et al., 2013Buchan J.R. Kolaitis R.M. Taylor J.P. Parker R.

Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1224-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, these efforts need to be complemented with in vivo approaches that address potential loss or gain of SG protein interactions following cell lysis. Furthermore, there is an unmet need to systematically examine the extent to which SG composition is dependent on cell type, the nature of the stressor, and the presence of disease-linked mutations in SG proteins. In this study, we use a combination of ascorbate peroxidase (APEX)-mediated in vivo proximity labeling (Rhee et al., 2013Rhee H.W. Zou P. Udeshi N.D. Martell J.D. Mootha V.K. Carr S.A. Ting A.Y. Proteomic mapping of mitochondria in living cells via spatially restricted enzymatic tagging.Science. 2013; 339: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) with quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) and an RBP-focused immunofluorescence (IF) approach to comprehensively and significantly expand the repertoire of known SG proteins across different cell types, stress conditions, and disease states. We show that SG proteins form a dense protein interaction network (PIN) in unstressed cells that is poised to enable rapid SG assembly in response to stress. In addition, we find that SGs in neuronal cells are particularly diverse in composition and contain numerous protein quality control (PQC) factors. We reveal aberrant composition, behavior, and subcellular localization of SGs in motor neurons derived from stem cell models harboring ALS-associated mutations in HNRNPA2B1 and C9orf72. By systematically integrating our refined SG proteome with published neurodegeneration-relevant datasets, we provide a framework for further investigations into the molecular underpinnings of SG biology and how it relates to human disease. To underscore the potential of identifying unexpected disease-relevant factors among SG proteins, we show that known and previously unknown SG components modify neurotoxicity in Drosophila models of FUS-, TDP-43-, and C9orf72-mediated degeneration. We characterize one of these, UBAP2L, as an essential, disordered, and highly aggregation-prone SG protein that can modulate ALS phenotypes in vivo. To investigate the protein composition of SGs in living cells, we performed proximity labeling using an engineered ascorbate peroxidase (APEX2) fused to the well-characterized SG protein G3BP1 (Figure 1A). We used CRISPR/Cas9-directed genome engineering to insert APEX2-GFP into the endogenous G3BP1 locus in HEK293T cells (Figure S1A). The resulting G3BP1-APEX2-GFP fusion protein allows visualization of SGs upon sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) exposure, as well as robust and rapid biotin labeling of SG proteins in the presence of biotin-phenol (BP) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Figures 1B and 1C). As a specificity control, cells with constitutive expression of cytoplasmic-localized APEX2 (NES-APEX2-GFP) (Figure S1B) show a diffuse GFP signal and a biotinylation pattern that is unaffected by NaAsO2 (Figures 1B and 1C).Figure S1APEX Cell Line Generation, MS Experimental Design, and Data and Analysis, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Schematic of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated endogenous tagging of the G3BP1 locus.(B) Schematic of generating a constitutive hPGK::NES-APEX2-GFP-expressing HEK293T cell line.(C) Schematic description of the SILAC experimental workflow.(D) Venn diagram showing overview of all proteins detected by MS in streptavidin affinity-purified samples, corresponding input samples in relation to a list of known SG proteins.(E) Flow chart depicting data analysis steps to identify candidate SG proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Schematic of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated endogenous tagging of the G3BP1 locus.

(E) Flow chart depicting data analysis steps to identify candidate SG proteins. Since G3BP1 is essential for SG formation and robustly localizes to SGs, we reasoned that defining the interactome proximal to G3BP1 under stress conditions approximates the SG proteome. We employed a series of quantitative proteomics experiments (Figure S1C) to systematically identify three classes of G3BP1-interacting proteins in stressed and unstressed cells: (1) stress-independent interactors, which associate with G3BP1 independently of stress; (2) stress-dependent partners, which associate with G3BP1 only under stress; and (3) stress-sensitive interactors, whose association with G3BP1 is lost or weakened during stress (Figure 1D). To distinguish these interactors, we pursued four experimental schemes (Figure 1E). First, to identify stress-dependent G3BP1 interactors, we characterized biotinylated proteins in stressed versus unstressed G3BP1-APEX2-GFP cells (experiment 1). Next, we compared lysates from stressed G3BP1-APEX2-GFP cells incubated with BP to lysates of identically treated cells for which the BP substrate was omitted (experiment 2). Third, to control for diffuse cytoplasmic labeling by G3BP1-APEX2-GFP, we also compared lysates from stressed G3BP1-APEX2-GFP and NES-APEX2-GFP cells (experiment 3). Last, to define stress-independent as well as stress-sensitive G3BP1 interactors, we profiled lysates from unstressed G3BP1-APEX2-GFP and NES-APEX2-GFP cells (experiment 4). For each approach, we conducted biologically independent triplicate labeling reactions followed by mixing of lysates and streptavidin purification of biotinylated proteins. Affinity-purified samples and the corresponding input samples were analyzed by quantitative MS. In total, we detected 1,416 proteins across all input samples and 2,020 proteins across all streptavidin enrichments (Figure S1D), accounting for 64% (153) of a manually curated list of 238 annotated SG proteins (Table S2). Protein identification and quantification of heavy to light (H/L) ratios were highly reproducible across replicate experiments (Figure S2; Table S1). We compared the enrichment of known SG proteins to the background distribution of all detected proteins (Figures 1E and 2A ). Known SG proteins were significantly enriched across all four approaches, with the greatest shift in log2 H/L ratios detected in experiments 2 and 3. Interestingly, we observed attenuated enrichment of known SG proteins in experiment 1 and that even in the absence of stress (experiment 4), known SG proteins appeared to be enriched in the IP samples (Figures 1E and 2A).Figure 2SG-APEX Identifies Known and Previously Unknown SG Proteins within a Dense Interaction NetworkShow full caption(A) Enrichment frequency distribution of known SG proteins in log2 H/L-ranked proteomics datasets.

See also Table S3. We used a series of analysis steps to identify candidate SG proteins from our quantitative proteomics data (Figure S1E). We first leveraged our curated list of annotated SG proteins to determine log2 H/L ratio cutoffs in a non-parametric approach similar to previous ratiometric SILAC APEX experiments (Hung et al., 2014Hung V. Zou P. Rhee H.W. Udeshi N.D. Cracan V. Svinkina T. Carr S.A. Mootha V.K. Ting A.Y. Proteomic mapping of the human mitochondrial intermembrane space in live cells via ratiometric APEX tagging.Mol. Cell. 2014; 55: 332-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). We ranked identified proteins in each replicate by their log2 H/L ratio and calculated the frequency distribution of known SG proteins across the ranked lists (Figure 2A). We chose as a conservative cutoff the ratio at which the frequency of known SG proteins in a moving window fell below 2-fold the frequency across all detected proteins. In parallel, we applied an empirical Bayes method (Kammers et al., 2015Kammers K. Cole R.N. Tiengwe C. Ruczinski I. Detecting significant changes in protein abundance.EuPA Open Proteom. 2015; 7: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) to identify proteins that were significantly enriched in heavy over light samples. This method is based on the linear models for microarray data (LIMMA) approach (Smyth, 2004Smyth G.K. Linear models and empirical Bayes methods for assessing differential expression in microarray experiments.Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol. 2004; 3 (Article3)Crossref PubMed Scopus (9158) Google Scholar), which is also applicable to quantitative proteomics data (Margolin et al., 2009Margolin A.A. Ong S.E. Schenone M. Gould R. Schreiber S.L. Carr S.A. Golub T.R. Empirical Bayes analysis of quantitative proteomics experiments.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7454Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It uses the actual observed data to moderate individual protein variances through an estimated global sample variance, and thus enables a more robust identification of significant changes in protein abundance than ordinary t-statistics. The resulting moderated p values are corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using a modified Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) approach to determine a moderated q-value (q.mod). For the final list of SG candidates, we initially selected all proteins that were above the ratio cutoff in at least 2 out of 3 IP replicates. We defined a set of 123 proteins from the overlapping sets as shown in Figure 2B (shaded in gray). Of these, 80% (99/123) are also statistically significantly enriched (q.mod < 0.05) in at least one experiment. For most of the remaining 24 proteins, no significance values could be determined due to missing data in one of the biological replicates. However, as ∼25% of these proteins were previously known SG proteins, we chose to retain them in our final list (marked by # in Figure 2B). Table S3 provides a detailed overview of all hit candidates across all four experimental designs. Underscoring the robustness of the approach, many well-characterized SG proteins (e.g., G3BP1, TIA1, CAPRIN1, PABPC1, FMR1, and ATXN2) were identified as highly significant interactors across multiple experiments (Figure 2C). In summary, nearly 80% (96/123) of hits are known SG proteins (69/123), were verified by IF (13/123), or have additional data supporting SG association, such as closely related family members or interactions with known SG proteins (14/100; e.g., HNRNPDL, YTHDF3). For example, the DEAD-box helicase DDX1 is known to localize to SGs and was shown to form an RNA transport complex with C14ORF166, FAM98A/B, and RTCB (Pérez-González et al., 2014Pérez-González A. Pazo A. Navajas R. Ciordia S. Rodriguez-Frandsen A. Nieto A. hCLE/C14orf166 associates with DDX1-HSPC117-FAM98B in a novel transcription-dependent shuttling RNA-transporting complex.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e90957Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), all of which we identify as SG candidates (Figures 2B and 2C). Interestingly, our SG protein set also contains ANXA11, its closest paralog ANXA7, and their interactor PEF1 (Figures 2B and 2C). While none of these proteins had previously been implicated in SG biology, ANXA11 was recently shown to harbor ALS-associated mutations leading to abnormal protein aggregation (Smith et al., 2017Smith B.N. Topp S.D. Fallini C. Shibata H. Chen H.J. Troakes C. King A. Ticozzi N. Kenna K.P. Soragia-Gkazi A. et al.Mutations in the vesicular trafficking protein annexin A11 are associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9: eaad9157Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In summary, we demonstrate that APEX proximity labeling can be applied to dynamic RNP granules to identify known and previously unknown SG proteins with relevance to neurodegenerative disease. Visible SGs only coalesce in response to cellular stress; however, our data suggested an enrichment of SG proteins in the G3BP1 interactome even in unstressed cells. Indeed, we found that less than half (48.8% [60/123]) of SG-APEX hits were stress-dependent interactors (Figure 2B), including 11 (out of 12 detected) individual subunits of the EIF3 and EIF4 translation initiation factors, which are thought to accumulate in stalled pre-initiation complexes in SGs. Remarkably, 51.2% (63/123) of APEX hits, including many well-studied SG proteins (e.g., CAPRIN1, FMR1, TIA1, and USP10), interact with G3BP1 in the absence of stress (Figures 2B and 2C). To expand on these findings, we also retrieved publicly available direct protein-protein interaction (PPI) data for all proteins either detected by SG-APEX in HEK293T cells or previously annotated as SG proteins. The resulting SG-PIN contains 283 nodes and 866 non-redundant edges (Figure 2D) and is more densely connected than PINs built from an equal number of randomly selected nodes and edges (Figure 2E). In combination with our SG-APEX data, this suggests a pre-existing steady-state network of protein interactions that likely facilitates the rapid coalescence of microscopically visible SGs upon exposure of cells to environmental stress. To enable analysis of SGs in more neurodegeneration-relevant cell types, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering to generate G3BP1-APEX2-GFP-expressing human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Upon differentiation to neural progenitor cells (NPCs) (Figure 3A), G3BP1-APEX2-GFP robustly localized to SGs upon NaAsO2 treatment and streptavidin staining overlapped well with the GFP signal (Figure S3A). We then used quantitative proteomics to compare NaAsO2-treated and unstressed G3BP1-APEX2-GFP expressing NPCs, as well as NaAsO2-treated G3BP1-APEX2-GFP cells with and without substrate (Figure S3B). To compare the effects of different stressors, we used thapsigargin in parallel experiments. In total, we detected 3,880 proteins across all streptavidin enrichments and input samples that account for 77% (183/238) of known SG proteins (Figure S3C; Table S4). Analysis of log2 H/L ratio distributions and enrichment of known SG proteins in the data gave similar results to those observed in HEK293T cells, with high enrichment of known SG proteins in all experiments (Figure 3B,C). Using a similar analysis strategy as in HEK293T cells, we designated 178 proteins from experiments with both stressors as candidate SG proteins in NPCs (Figure S3D; Table S4). Of these, 45.5% (81/178) are known SG proteins and another 21.3% (38/178) were either closely related to known SG proteins, also identified as SG candidates in HEK293T cells, or independently validated by IF (Figures 3D and 3E; Table S4).Figure S3APEX-Mediated Biotinylation, Experimental Design, and Detected Proteins in Neural Progenitor Cells, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Streptavidin staining of unstressed (top panel) and sodium arsenite-treated (middle and bottom panels) CV-B G3BP1-APEX2-GFP neural progenitor cells.

Interestingly, of the combined 221 SG-APEX hits from NPCs and HEK293T cells, 64% (141/221) were identified in only one cell type (Figure 3D). Many of these proteins identified in only one cell type were not detected in sufficient experiments in the other cell line, likely due to incomplete capture of lowly expressed proteins and differences in protein abundance between cell types. Nevertheless, these findings suggested a potentially larger than anticipated cell-type-specific diversity of SG composition and called for further examination through complementary approaches. We next wanted to evaluate whether the seemingly greater complexity of neuronal SG composition might contribute to rendering these cell types especially vulnerable to environmental stress and subsequent protein aggregation. As expected, several proteins with known neuronal expression and links to neurodegeneration (e.g., CELF2/3, ELAVL2/3/4, and GIGYF1/2) were among the neuronal SG proteins. In addition, we validated the SG association of several previously unknown candidates involved in the regulation of protein folding (HSPD1, PPIG, and VBP1) (Figure 3F). A second pillar of proteostasis is clearance of aggregates, and we identified numerous factors that function in autophagy and related vesicular transport processes (Figure 3G) among our neuronal SG proteins. Several of these (GABARAPL2, YLPM1, and SAFB2) cluster in the ULK-AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) subnetwork of the human autophagy system (Behrends et al., 2010Behrends C. Sowa M.E. Gygi S.P. Harper J.W. Network organization of the human autophagy system.Nature. 2010; 466: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar), which also contains constitutive SG proteins (G3BP1, USP10, and CDC37) and may integrate aging and the cellular stress response (Salminen and Kaarniranta, 2012Salminen A.

The extent to which SG proteins are surveilled by autophagy factors is further highlighted by the finding that 5 of the 6 proteins with the highest connectivity to an extended list of SG candidates comprising all 361 APEX hits and previously known SG proteins are members of the ATG8 family of small ubiquitin-like modifiers (Figure 3H). Indeed, ∼16% of all GABARAPL2 (85/539) and 17% of all MAP1LC3A (65/383) interactio"
https://openalex.org/W2785833536,"A new type of fungal lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) catalyzes the oxidative degradation of xylan components of cellulosic biomass and offers potential in wood biorefining. Wood biomass is the most abundant feedstock envisioned for the development of modern biorefineries. However, the cost-effective conversion of this form of biomass into commodity products is limited by its resistance to enzymatic degradation. Here we describe a new family of fungal lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) prevalent among white-rot and brown-rot basidiomycetes that is active on xylans—a recalcitrant polysaccharide abundant in wood biomass. Two AA14 LPMO members from the white-rot fungus Pycnoporus coccineus substantially increase the efficiency of wood saccharification through oxidative cleavage of highly refractory xylan-coated cellulose fibers. The discovery of this unique enzyme activity advances our knowledge on the degradation of woody biomass in nature and offers an innovative solution for improving enzyme cocktails for biorefinery applications."

CRISPR–Cas9 is a versatile RNA-guided genome editing tool. Here we demonstrate that partial replacement of RNA nucleotides with DNA nucleotides in CRISPR RNA (crRNA) enables efficient gene editing in human cells. This strategy of partial DNA replacement retains on-target activity when used with both crRNA and sgRNA, as well as with multiple guide sequences. Partial DNA replacement also works for crRNA of Cpf1, another CRISPR system. We find that partial DNA replacement in the guide sequence significantly reduces off-target genome editing through focused analysis of off-target cleavage, measurement of mismatch tolerance and genome-wide profiling of off-target sites. Using the structure of the Cas9–sgRNA complex as a guide, the majority of the 3′ end of crRNA can be replaced with DNA nucleotide, and the 5 - and 3′-DNA-replaced crRNA enables efficient genome editing. Cas9 guided by a DNA–RNA chimera may provide a generalized strategy to reduce both the cost and the off-target genome editing in human cells."

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells targeting surface-bound tumor antigens have yielded promising clinical outcomes, with two CD19 CAR-T cell therapies recently receiving FDA approval for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. The adoption of CARs for the recognition of soluble ligands, a distinct class of biomarkers in physiology and disease, could considerably broaden the utility of CARs in disease treatment. In this study, we demonstrate that CAR-T cells can be engineered to respond robustly to diverse soluble ligands, including the CD19 ectodomain, GFP variants, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). We additionally show that CAR signaling in response to soluble ligands relies on ligand-mediated CAR dimerization and that CAR responsiveness to soluble ligands can be fine-tuned by adjusting the mechanical coupling between the CAR's ligand-binding and signaling domains. Our results support a role for mechanotransduction in CAR signaling and demonstrate an approach for systematically engineering immune-cell responses to soluble, extracellular ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2784755083,"The mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is a heterogeneous collection of related protein complexes required for gene regulation and genome integrity. It contains a central ATPase (BRM or BRG1) and various combinations of 10-14 accessory subunits (BAFs for B RM/BRG1 A ssociated F actor s ). Two distinct complexes differing in size, BAF and the slightly larger polybromo-BAF (PBAF), share many of the same core subunits but are differentiated primarily by having either AT-rich interaction domain 1A/B (ARID1A/B in BAF) or ARID2 (in PBAF). Using density gradient centrifugation and immunoprecipitation, we have identified and characterized a third and smaller SWI/SNF subcomplex. We termed this complex GBAF because it incorporates two mutually exclusive paralogs, GLTSCR1 (glioma tumor suppressor candidate region gene 1) or GLTSCR1L (GLTSCR1-like), instead of an ARID protein. In addition to GLTSCR1 or GLTSCR1L, the GBAF complex contains BRD9 (bromodomain-containing 9) and the BAF subunits BAF155, BAF60, SS18, BAF53a, and BRG1/BRM. We observed that GBAF does not contain the core BAF subunits BAF45, BAF47, or BAF57. Even without these subunits, GBAF displayed in vitro ATPase activity and bulk chromatin affinity comparable to those of BAF. GBAF associated with BRD4, but, unlike BRD4, the GBAF component GLTSCR1 was not required for the viability of the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line. In contrast, GLTSCR1 or GLTSCR1L knockouts in the metastatic prostate cancer cell line PC3 resulted in a loss in proliferation and colony-forming ability. Taken together, our results provide evidence for a compositionally novel SWI/SNF subcomplex with cell type-specific functions."

Allogeneic HSC transplantation is a life-saving treatment for malignant and nonmalignant disorders. HSCs isolated from umbilical cord blood (CB) are used for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), but due to the limited numbers of HSCs in single units of umbilical CB, a number of methods have been proposed for ex vivo expansion of human HSCs. We show here that antagonism of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ promotes ex vivo expansion of phenotypically and functionally defined subsets of human CB HSCs and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HSPCs). PPAR-γ antagonism in CB HSPCs strongly downregulated expression of several differentiation-associated genes, as well as fructose-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1; which encodes a negative regulator of glycolysis), and enhanced glycolysis without compromising mitochondrial metabolism. The expansion of CB HSPCs by PPAR-γ antagonism was completely suppressed by removal of glucose or inhibition of glycolysis. Moreover, knockdown of FBP1 expression promoted glycolysis and ex vivo expansion of long-term repopulating CB HSPCs, whereas overexpression of FBP1 suppressed the expansion of CB HSPCs that was induced by PPAR-γ antagonism. Our study suggests the possibility for a new and simple means for metabolic reprogramming of CB HSPCs to improve the efficacy of HCT."

Among the recently developed neural networks, we use a Recursive Neural Network to improve the performance of DDI extraction. Our recursive neural network model uses a position feature, a subtree containment feature, and an ensemble method to improve the performance of DDI extraction. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, the DDI detection and type classifiers of our model performed 4.4% and 2.8% better, respectively, on the DDIExtraction Challenge'13 test data. We also validated our model on the PK DDI corpus that consists of two types of DDIs data: in vivo DDI and in vitro DDI.

Single-nucleotide mapping thus complements traditional deletion and overexpression screening paradigms and opens new frontiers in quantitative genetics. Genetics is not destiny. However, the DNA polymorphisms that we inherit from our parents can affect our risk for disease, the physical dimensions of our bodies, and even our baseline behavioral tendencies (Visscher et al., 2012Visscher P.M. Brown M.A. McCarthy M.I. Yang J. Five years of GWAS discovery.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2012; 90: 7-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar). Long before physical genomes could be fully sequenced, the early pioneers of quantitative genetics scoured the genome for mutations responsible for the most extreme manifestations of these traits (Botstein et al., 1980Botstein D.

Lander E.S. et al.A genetic linkage map of the human genome.Cell. 1987; 51: 319-337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). By harnessing the power of family pedigrees, investigators linked unique restriction endonuclease sites to disease alleles, creating the first linkage maps of our genomes (Hall et al., 1990Hall J.M. Lee M.K. Newman B. Morrow J.E. Anderson L.A. Huey B. King M.C. Linkage of early-onset familial breast cancer to chromosome 17q21.Science. 1990; 250: 1684-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). Although linkage was a blessing that allowed geneticists to pinpoint genes responsible for Mendelian diseases, it is now a curse for the vast majority of heritable traits, which are influenced by many variants of small effect (Manolio et al., 2009Manolio T.A. Collins F.S. Cox N.J. Goldstein D.B. Hindorff L.A. Hunter D.J. McCarthy M.I. Ramos E.M. Cardon L.R. Chakravarti A. et al.Finding the missing heritability of complex diseases.Nature. 2009; 461: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (5903) Google Scholar). Identifying these variants is hampered by the sparsity of meiotic crossovers. Even in a highly outbred human population, the average size of a haplotype block spans dozens of polymorphisms (Frazer et al., 2007Frazer K.A. Ballinger D.G. Cox D.R. Hinds D.A. Stuve L.L. Gibbs R.A. Belmont J.W. Boudreau A. Hardenbol P.

Faggart M. et al.The structure of haplotype blocks in the human genome.Science. 2002; 296: 2225-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (4737) Google Scholar), meaning that each causal polymorphism is inherited along with numerous statistically indistinguishable passenger mutations. Thus, despite rapid advances in identifying polymorphisms, modern genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are often unable to distinguish true causal mutations from nearby neutral variants. Current methods for fine mapping rely on functional profiling of candidate variants within each quantitative trait locus (QTL). However, in virtually all cases, attribution of causality is based on some prior knowledge from directed studies, preventing discovery of fundamentally new variants. Low genetic mapping resolution is especially pronounced for inbred crosses of laboratory organisms. Although such studies can capture a far greater degree of heritability than most GWAS (Flint et al., 2005Flint J. Valdar W. Shifman S. Mott R. Strategies for mapping and cloning quantitative trait genes in rodents.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 271-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), practical constraints dictate that their embedded crossing schemes involve a limited number of meioses. Inbred crosses in yeast with over 1,000 fully genotyped segregants can thus explain >90% of a trait’s heritability, but are only able to map QTLs with a resolution that spans dozens of genes in the compact yeast genome (10–100 kb) (Bloom et al., 2013Bloom J.S. Ehrenreich I.M. Loo W.T. Lite T.L.V. Kruglyak L. Finding the sources of missing heritability in a yeast cross.Nature. 2013; 494: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Identifying the causal variant within a QTL requires manually engineering dozens of candidate polymorphisms or performing laborious backcrosses. This last-mile problem in identifying causal variants has severely restrained the practical utility of inbred crossing strategies in systematically informing our understanding of how natural genetic variation drives phenotypic change. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for identifying causal variants with true statistical rigor and without the need for any additional experimentation. We put our theory into practice by mapping hundreds of causal variants in a highly inbred yeast cross. This carefully designed experiment liberated each site of genetic variation from its original genetic background, allowing us to decouple the phenotypic effects of variants separated by as few as 100 base pairs. Our data provide new insights into the richness of natural genetic variation and charts a roadmap for achieving a central objective of quantitative genetics: systematic understanding of the relationship between genotype and phenotype at single-nucleotide resolution. The statistical resolution of mapping genotype to phenotype is fundamentally limited by genetic linkage between adjacent variants. Closely related individuals share long haplotype blocks, where polymorphisms in the same gene or region are perfectly correlated. Such linkage can be broken by meiotic recombination. In highly outbred populations, recombination over thousands of generations fragments ancestral haplotypes into smaller and smaller pieces. However, outbreeding comes with the cost of introducing new haplotypes and de novo mutations that systematically confound GWAS. Thus, studies in model organisms commonly employ inbreeding so that every allele can be traced to either a maternal or paternal haplotype. Within this restricted genotype space, DNA sequence can fully explain the heritability of most phenotypes (Bloom et al., 2013Bloom J.S. Ehrenreich I.M. Loo W.T. Lite T.L.V. Kruglyak L. Finding the sources of missing heritability in a yeast cross.Nature. 2013; 494: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, Märtens et al., 2016Märtens K. Hallin J. Warringer J. Liti G. Parts L. Predicting quantitative traits from genome and phenome with near perfect accuracy.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11512Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) discovered in these crosses span dozens of highly linked variants and thus often cannot even identify a specific causal gene. The phenotypic effect of adjacent variants can be distinguished in theory if a sufficient number of individuals contain meiotic breakpoints between the variants. The number of breakpoints between two loci scales with recombination rate (ρ) and the number of individuals genotyped (N). These design parameters are thus governed by choice of model organism and practical ability to sequence and maintain large cohorts of individuals. Across eukarya, we observed differences in recombination rate that spanned several orders of magnitude (Segura et al., 2013Segura J. Ferretti L. Ramos-Onsins S. Capilla L. Farré M. Reis F. Oliver-Bonet M. Fernández-Bellón H. Garcia F.

Variation in genomic recombination rates among animal taxa and the case of social insects.Heredity (Edinb). 2007; 98: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). Larger genome sizes correlated strongly with reduced recombination rates (with a power law exponent of −3/4; see STAR Methods for further discussion). Thus, larger genomes incur two simultaneous costs: greater expenditure in sequencing and inferior resolution in mapping causal variants. We noticed that the budding yeast S. cerevisiae was a particularly favorable outlier with a 12 megabase (Mb) genome and an average of 3.4 recombinations per Mb (340 cM/Mb). Most other commonly studied model organisms had below average recombination rates (∼3 crossovers per generation or 1.6 cM/Mb in flies, ∼14 per generation or 0.4 cM/Mb in mice). To compensate for infrequent recombination, inbred lines in mice and flies have employed successive generations of inbreeding to boost crossover density. However, even after >50 generations of inbreeding, these crosses have been unable to map causal variants at even single gene level resolution, let alone to single nucleotides (Iraqi et al., 2012Iraqi F.A. Mahajne M. Salaymah Y. Sandovski H. Tayem H. Vered K. Balmer L. Hall M. Manship G.

Macdonald S.J. Long A.D. Properties and power of the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource for the routine dissection of complex traits.Genetics. 2012; 191: 935-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Even with the unique advantages inherent to yeast, systematic mapping of causal variants has not been possible with existing designs. We turned to computational modeling to define the practical requirements of an inbred yeast cross that would enable single-nucleotide resolution mapping. We varied three key parameters in our model: (1) number of generations of inbreeding (G), (2) number of individuals genotyped (N), and (3) the mean physical distance between adjacent polymorphisms (μ). These simulations revealed a set of feasible designs that had not been previously explored (Figures 1B and 1C). A key new feature of these designs was their restricted degree of polymorphism– on the order of 1 per 1,000 base pairs. Crosses with larger degrees of polymorphism required a proportional increase in the number of individuals genotyped. As a rule, the sensitivity of identifying causal variants scaled with the number of total crossovers versus the density of polymorphisms: Sensitivity∼N∗(G+1/2)∗ρ∗μ. However, precision delineated an all-or-nothing boundary in parameter space. Not all traits we simulated mapped equally well. Highly heritable traits were more accurately mapped than weakly heritable traits, and the relationship between heritability and accuracy was non-linear (Figure 1D). This highlights a built-in advantage of investigating phenotypes with minimal environmental contributions. Considering the constraints of time and money on G and N, we selected a yeast cross design with 1 polymorphism per 1,000 base pairs. Because this is on par with the genetic divergence between individuals within a species, a cross with this design would have the potential to comprehensively illuminate how precise genetic differences between individuals manifest as heritable traits. The degree of polymorphism present in a genetic cross determines both the complexity of a quantitative trait and the resolution at which causal variants can be mapped. Geneticists often employ large divergence between parents (heterozygosity = 1/μ ∼0.01) because it ensures phenotypic diversity in progeny (Bloom et al., 2013Bloom J.S. Ehrenreich I.M. Loo W.T.

Yet in practice this also ensures that causal variants cannot be distinguished from adjacent passenger mutations. We re-examined this prevailing orthodoxy by constructing an inbred cross in S. cerevisiae with a ∼10-fold reduction in the number of segregating variants compared to prior studies (Bloom et al., 2013Bloom J.S.

We chose parents with uniform genetic variation across the genome (heterozygosity ∼0.001), derived from very different ecological and geographical niches (Liti et al., 2009Liti G. Carter D.M.

As a frame of reference, this degree of polymorphism, or number of genetic differences between the crossed strains, is comparable to the genetic distance between two individual humans and represents, on average, multiple mutations per gene. A potential concern about reducing the genetic variance between parents is that it might unduly restrict diversification of biological traits in progeny. The phenotypic profiles of the two parents were indeed relatively well correlated (r∼0.6) despite having been isolated from different ecotypes (Figure S1A). However, their meiotic progeny exhibited a high degree of variation across diverse traits (Figures S1B–S1H). Remarkably, they were as phenotypically diverse as the most distantly related strains on the S. cerevisiae phylogenetic tree (Figure S1E), underscoring the power of meiotic recombination to produce new traits by placing genetic variants in new genomic environments. Our model predicted that six generations of inbreeding would produce a sufficient number of meiotic crossovers to statistically resolve individual causal variants from adjacent variants (Figure 2A; see STAR Methods for further discussion). To prevent inadvertent fixation of one parental allele at some loci, we maintained a large pooled population at every step of inbreeding and clonal propagation (Figures S2A and S2B). After six generations, we isolated 1,125 F6 haploid progeny and performed whole-genome sequencing on clonal expansions of each individual (Figures S2C and S2D). In total, these F6 offspring contained over ten times more meiotic crossovers than sites of variation (SNPs), a ratio that our model predicted would be ideal for detecting genome-wide association at single-nucleotide resolution.Figure S2Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Schematic for passaging an inbred cross across six generations, using genetic selection of diploids and mechanical enrichment for spores to maintain a large population size > 107 cells.(B) High sporulation efficiency was achieved within 5 days in 1% KAc and verified by microscopy to determine the fraction of tetrads.

We first used our cross to map resistance to azoles, the most commonly used class of antifungal drugs. We measured the growth all 1,125 F6 offspring upon exposure to seven azoles from three major categories: first generation imidazole-based drugs, second- and third-generation triazoles in widespread clinical use, and agricultural azoles. Although these drugs harbor distinct functional groups around their central heterocyclic rings, they share a common drug target: Erg11, the rate-limiting enzyme in ergosterol biosynthesis (Ghannoum and Rice, 1999Ghannoum M.A. Rice L.B. Antifungal agents: mode of action, mechanisms of resistance, and correlation of these mechanisms with bacterial resistance.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 12: 501-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, we observed a relatively correlated response to all classes of azole-based drugs in the meiotic progeny (mean r2 = 0.41) (Figures S1G and S1H). To identify the genetic determinants of pan-azole resistance, we performed QTL mapping. This standard analysis established a locus of strong effect on the right arm of Chromosome 4 (Figure 2B; see STAR Methods). In previous yeast crosses, the statistical boundaries of such a QTL (1.5 delta logarithm of the odds [ΔLOD]) would typically span 10–100 kb, hundreds of candidate mutations, and dozens of genes in the highly compact yeast genome (Bloom et al., 2013Bloom J.S.

However, due to the increase in meiotic crossovers inherent to our inbreeding scheme, the same statistical cutoffs allowed us to identify a single causal gene: UPC2. UPC2 is a positive regulator of ergosterol biosynthesis that is activated in response to sterol depletion, providing a logical link between this gene and pleiotropic azole resistance (Yang et al., 2015Yang H.

Commun. 2015; 6: 6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Next, we attempted to increase our resolution from a single causal gene to a specific causal polymorphism. UPC2 harbored 5 candidate mutations (Figure 2C). In addition to one promoter variant, the UPC2 ORF contained two synonymous and two nonsynonymous variants. Currently, investigators employ computational approaches that integrate prevailing experimental intuition and conservation metrics to estimate the likelihood that individual polymorphisms are responsible for diseases or other traits. These algorithms (e.g., SIFT [Kumar et al., 2009Kumar P. Henikoff S. Ng P.C. Predicting the effects of coding non-synonymous variants on protein function using the SIFT algorithm.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar] and PolyPhen-2 [Adzhubei et al., 2010Adzhubei I.A. Schmidt S. Peshkin L. Ramensky V.E. Gerasimova A. Bork P. Kondrashov A.S. Sunyaev S.R. A method and server for predicting damaging missense mutations.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 248-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (9354) Google Scholar]) would miss UPC2, as both missense mutations were predicted to be ‘tolerated’ and the other classes of mutations (e.g., synonymous variants) are uniformly ignored. To test these assumptions experimentally, we performed “gold standard” allele replacement experiments in which we swapped each candidate SNP at its endogenous locus via homologous recombination (Jarosz and Lindquist, 2010Jarosz D.F. Lindquist S. Hsp90 and environmental stress transform the adaptive value of natural genetic variation.Science. 2010; 330: 1820-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, Steinmetz et al., 2002Steinmetz L.M.

Dissecting the architecture of a quantitative trait locus in yeast.Nature. 2002; 416: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, one of the synonymous mutations in UPC2 (2694C→ T) was responsible for the pan-azole resistance (Figures S3A–S3C). However, this brute-force approach is not amenable to systematic discovery of causal variants, and it is especially ill-suited for the large confidence intervals inherent to most QTLs. It often fails entirely when dissecting the loci of minor effect that give rise to genetically complex traits. Fortunately, the density of meiotic recombination in our cross allowed us to discriminate among candidate variants with genetics alone. We noticed that multiple meiotic crossovers within the UPC2 locus created natural allele replacements. Although most segregants contained only clinical or wine variants at all UPC2 positions, thirty-eight harbored crossovers between the two parental haplotypes at this locus. When these meiotic crossovers swapped passenger mutations in UPC2, no phenotypic change was observed (Figure 2D). In contrast, swapping the single true causal variant (2694C→ T) was equivalent to swapping all five mutations in the haplotype block. We used these natural allele replacements to formalize a new fine mapping statistic (quantitative trait nucleotide [QTN] score) that enhanced the statistical resolution of most QTLs to single-nucleotide resolution (Figures 2E, S3D–S3H, and S4; see STAR Methods for extended discussion). We extended this fine mapping analysis to all loci associated with azole resistance. The locus of strongest effect typically accounted for roughly a quarter of the variance of a trait. Yet dozens more variants were generally required to fully explain heritability. Although mapping was less reliable for such variants of small effect, many were still resolved to single nucleotides and most to single genes. We discovered a coherent network of 35 causal variants that contributed to resistance across multiple classes of azoles (Figure 2F). The network included polymorphisms in some known antifungal resistance genes (ERG11, PDR16, OLE1) and as a whole was strongly enriched in genetic and physical interactions (p < 10−4). We observed virtually no overlap with the causal variants of an orthogonal antifungal drug (amphotericin B) (Figure S1H), establishing the specific relationship between these individual polymorphisms and azole resistance. Across all of the complex traits that we studied, pleiotropic alleles tended to reside in genes already annotated as such by other functional genomic methods, including PDR1, the major transcription factor that regulates pleiotropic drug response elements. Our ability to distinguish the effects of adjacent SNPs prompted us to investigate whether multiple mutations"
https://openalex.org/W2787104120,"High levels of zinc oxide are used frequently as feed additive in pigs to improve gut health and growth performance and are still suggested as an alternative to antimicrobial growth promoters. However, we have recently described an increase of multi-resistant E. coli in association to zinc feeding in piglets. This previous study focused on clonal diversity of E. coli, observing the effect on multi-resistant strains by chance. To shed further light into this highly important topic and falsify our previous findings, we performed a zinc pig feeding trial where we specifically focused on in-depth analysis of antimicrobial resistant E. coli. Under controlled experimental conditions, piglets were randomly allocated to a high dietary zinc (zinc group) and a background zinc feeding group (control group). At different ages samples were taken from feces, digesta, and mucosa and absolute E. coli numbers were determined. A total of 2665 E. coli isolates were than phenotypically tested for antimicrobial resistance and results were confirmed by minimum inhibitory concentration testing for random samples. In piglets fed with high dietary zinc, we detected a substantial increase of multi-resistant E. coli in all gut habitats tested, ranging from 28.9–30.2% multi-resistant E. coli compared to 5.8–14.0% in the control group. This increase was independent of the total number of E. coli. Interestingly, the total amount of the E. coli population decreased over time. Thus, the increase of the multi-resistant E. coli populations seems to be linked with persistence of the resistant population, caused by the influence of high dietary zinc feeding. In conclusion, these findings corroborate our previous report linking high dietary zinc feeding of piglets with the occurrence of antimicrobial resistant E. coli and therefore question the feeding of high dietary zinc oxide as alternative to antimicrobial growth promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2785200649,"Cholesterol biosynthesis is tightly regulated in the cell. For example, high sterol concentrations can stimulate degradation of the rate-limiting cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase, HMGCR). HMGCR is broken down by the endoplasmic reticulum membrane-associated protein complexes consisting of insulin-induced genes (Insigs) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase gp78. Here we found that HMGCR degradation is partially blunted in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells lacking gp78 (gp78-KO). To identify other ubiquitin ligase(s) that may function together with gp78 in triggering HMGCR degradation, we performed a small-scale short hairpin RNA-based screening targeting endoplasmic reticulum-localized E3s. We found that knockdown of both ring finger protein 145 (Rnf145) and gp78 genes abrogates sterol-induced degradation of HMGCR in CHO cells. We also observed that RNF145 interacts with Insig-1 and -2 proteins and ubiquitinates HMGCR. Moreover, the tetrapeptide sequence YLYF in the sterol-sensing domain and the Cys-537 residue in the RING finger domain were essential for RNF145 binding to Insigs and RNF145 E3 activity, respectively. Of note, amino acid substitutions in the YLYF or of Cys-537 completely abolished RNF145-mediated HMGCR degradation. In summary, our study reveals that RNF145, along with gp78, promotes HMGCR degradation in response to elevated sterol levels and identifies residues essential for RNF145 function."
https://openalex.org/W2784548911,"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play important roles in many biological systems. Given the vast conformational space that IDPs can explore, the thermodynamics of the interactions with their partners is closely linked to their biological functions. Intrinsically disordered regions of Phe–Gly nucleoporins (FG Nups) that contain multiple phenylalanine–glycine repeats are of particular interest, as their interactions with transport factors (TFs) underlie the paradoxically rapid yet also highly selective transport of macromolecules mediated by the nuclear pore complex. Here, we used NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry to thermodynamically characterize these multivalent interactions. These analyses revealed that a combination of low per-FG motif affinity and the enthalpy–entropy balance prevents high-avidity interaction between FG Nups and TFs, whereas the large number of FG motifs promotes frequent FG–TF contacts, resulting in enhanced selectivity. Our thermodynamic model underlines the importance of functional disorder of FG Nups. It helps explain the rapid and selective translocation of TFs through the nuclear pore complex and further expands our understanding of the mechanisms of fuzzy interactions involving IDPs."
https://openalex.org/W2788573825,"Objective This study examined adaptive responses to auditory perturbation of fundamental frequency (fo) in speakers with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and control speakers. Method Sixteen speakers with PD and nineteen control speakers produced sustained vowels while they received perturbed auditory feedback (i.e., fo shifted upward or downward). Speakers’ pitch acuity was quantified using a just-noticeable-difference (JND) paradigm. Twelve listeners provided estimates of the speech intelligibility for speakers with PD. Results Fifteen responses from each speaker group for each shift direction were included in analyses. While control speakers generally showed consistent adaptive responses opposing the perturbation, speakers with PD showed no compensation on average, with individual PD speakers showing highly variable responses. In the PD group, the degree of compensation was not significantly correlated with age, disease progression, pitch acuity, or intelligibility. Conclusions These findings indicate reduced adaptation to sustained fo perturbation and higher variability in PD compared to control participants. No significant differences were seen in pitch acuity between groups, suggesting that the fo adaptation deficit in PD is not the result of purely perceptual mechanisms. Significance These results suggest there is an impairment in vocal motor control in PD. Building on these results, contributions can be made to developing targeted voice treatments for PD."
https://openalex.org/W2784632870,"Viscoelasticity of soft tissue is often related to pathology, and therefore, has become an important diagnostic indicator in the clinical assessment of suspect tissue. Surgeons, particularly within head and neck subsites, typically use palpation techniques for intra-operative tumor detection. This detection method, however, is highly subjective and often fails to detect small or deep abnormalities. Vibroacoustography (VA) and similar methods have previously been used to distinguish tissue with high-contrast, but a firm understanding of the main contrast mechanism has yet to be verified. The contributions of tissue mechanical properties in VA images have been difficult to verify given the limited literature on viscoelastic properties of various normal and diseased tissue. This paper aims to investigate viscoelasticity theory and present a detailed description of viscoelastic experimental results obtained in tissue-mimicking phantoms (TMPs) and ex vivo tissues to verify the main contrast mechanism in VA and similar imaging modalities. A spherical-tip micro-indentation technique was employed with the Hertzian model to acquire absolute, quantitative, point measurements of the elastic modulus (E), long term shear modulus (η), and time constant (τ) in homogeneous TMPs and ex vivo tissue in rat liver and porcine liver and gallbladder. Viscoelastic differences observed between porcine liver and gallbladder tissue suggest that imaging modalities which utilize the mechanical properties of tissue as a primary contrast mechanism can potentially be used to quantitatively differentiate between proximate organs in a clinical setting. These results may facilitate more accurate tissue modeling and add information not currently available to the field of systems characterization and biomedical research."
https://openalex.org/W2792632412,"Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer and is one of the global malignancies with high mortality and morbidity. It is essential to identify and verify diagnostic biomarkers of early metastatic melanoma. Previous studies have systematically assessed protein biomarkers and mRNA-based expression characteristics. However, molecular markers for the early diagnosis of metastatic melanoma have not been identified. To explore potential regulatory targets, we have analyzed the gene microarray expression profiles of malignant melanoma samples by co-expression analysis based on the network approach. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by the EdgeR package of R software. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used for the identification of DEGs in the special gene modules and hub genes. Subsequently, a protein-protein interaction network was constructed to extract hub genes associated with gene modules. Finally, twenty-four important hub genes (RASGRP2, IKZF1, CXCR5, LTB, BLK, LINGO3, CCR6, P2RY10, RHOH, JUP, KRT14, PLA2G3, SPRR1A, KRT78, SFN, CLDN4, IL1RN, PKP3, CBLC, KRT16, TMEM79, KLK8, LYPD3 and LYPD5) were treated as valuable factors involved in the immune response and tumor cell development in tumorigenesis. In addition, a transcriptional regulatory network was constructed for these specific modules or hub genes, and a few core transcriptional regulators were found to be mostly associated with our hub genes, including GATA1, STAT1, SP1, and PSG1. In summary, our findings enhance our understanding of the biological process of malignant melanoma metastasis, enabling us to identify specific genes to use for diagnostic and prognostic markers and possibly for targeted therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2784935857,"Measuring temporal discounting through the use of intertemporal choice tasks is now the gold standard method for quantifying human choice impulsivity (impatience) in neuroscience, psychology, behavioral economics, public health and computational psychiatry. A recent area of growing interest is individual differences in discounting levels, as these may predispose to (or protect from) mental health disorders, addictive behaviors, and other diseases. At the same time, more and more studies have been dedicated to the quantification of individual attitudes towards risk, which have been measured in many clinical and non-clinical populations using closely related techniques. Economists have pointed to interactions between measurements of time preferences and risk preferences that may distort estimations of the discount rate. However, although becoming standard practice in economics, discount rates and risk preferences are rarely measured simultaneously in the same subjects in other fields, and the magnitude of the imposed distortion is unknown in the assessment of individual differences. Here, we show that standard models of temporal discounting -such as a hyperbolic discounting model widely present in the literature which fails to account for risk attitudes in the estimation of discount rates- result in a large and systematic pattern of bias in estimated discounting parameters. This can lead to the spurious attribution of differences in impulsivity between individuals when in fact differences in risk attitudes account for observed behavioral differences. We advance a model which, when applied to standard choice tasks typically used in psychology and neuroscience, provides both a better fit to the data and successfully de-correlates risk and impulsivity parameters. This results in measures that are more accurate and thus of greater utility to the many fields interested in individual differences in impulsivity."
https://openalex.org/W2784690678,"Glutathione S-transferase Pi (GSTP) is a thiolase that catalyzes the addition of glutathione (GSH) to receptive cysteines in target proteins, producing an S-glutathionylated residue. Accordingly, previous studies have reported that S-glutathionylation is constitutively decreased in cells from mice lacking GSTP (Gstp1/p2−/−). Here, we found that bone marrow–derived dendritic cells (BMDDCs) from Gstp1/p2−/− mice have proliferation rates that are greater than those in their WT counterparts (Gstp1/p2+/+).

These findings collectively suggest that GSTP-controlled protein S-glutathionylation regulates bone marrow progenitor cell function.

Although a number of studies suggest that downstream transcriptional events triggered by higher levels of ERα and estrogens contribute to enhanced proliferation and functions of BMDDCs, it remains unclear how redox conditions and hormone-based pathways might bisect. The goal of the present study was to elucidate whether GSTP regulates ERα and whether this in turn regulates proliferation, differentiation, and effector function of BMDDCs. We demonstrate that GSTP and ERα interact and that GSTP induces S-glutathionylation of critical cysteines within ERα. S-Glutathionylation of ERα decreases affinity of ERα for estradiol. We furthermore demonstrate that the absence of GSTP enhanced energy metabolism (glucose use and transition to glycolysis) and proliferative and differentiation rates and increased DC effector function in association with decreased ERα-SSG. A principle rationale for the initiation of the present studies was that analysis of an estrogen receptor signaling primer array comparing wildtype and knockout BMDDCs (Table 1 and Fig. S1) quantitatively demonstrated the existence of a nexus between GSTP and ERα: the most affected change caused by ablation of GSTP was increased expression of ERα, and this was accompanied by a decrease in expression of ERβ. A number of transcription and growth factors and accessory proteins were also increased (Table 1), including tyrosine kinase receptors of the ERB family and PELP1, a coactivator of ERα. Such data encouraged us to interrogate those factors that provided a link between GSTP-mediated redox regulation and estrogen receptor function, particularly as existing evidence already implicates each in bone marrow proliferation.Table 1Relative expression of genes for estrogen receptor signaling pathway in BMDDCs (Gstp1p2−/− versus Gstp1p2+/+)GeneSymbolExpressionEstrogen receptor 2 (β)Esr20.135Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2Ptgs20.144Trefoil factor 1Tff10.165WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein 2Wisp20.188Adenosine A1 receptorAdora10.254Insulin-like growth factor–binding protein 4Igfbp40.447Latent transforming growth factor β–binding protein 1Ltbp10.466Caveolin 1, caveolae proteinCav10.497Heat shock protein 90, α (cytosolic), class A member 1Hsp90aa10.499Complement component 3C30.517Glucuronidase, βGusb0.539Nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2Nr0b20.543Creatine kinase, brainCkb0.549Early growth response 3Egr30.587Nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 2Nr5a20.613Insulin receptor substrate 1Irs10.646Jun-B oncogeneJunb0.674Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase X-linkedG6pdx0.680Thrombospondin 1Thbs10.682FBJ osteosarcoma oncogeneFos0.696Lipoprotein lipaseLpl0.706Cbp/p300–interacting transactivatorCited20.725Breast cancer antiestrogen resistance 1Bcar10.730Insulin-like growth factor 1Igf10.761Heat shock protein 90, α (cytosolic), class B member 1Hsp90ab10.763Cathepsin DCtsd0.782v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene familyMaff0.795PrimePCR RNA Quality AssayRQ10.805Secreted phosphoprotein 1Spp10.816Cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily a, polypeptide 1Cyp1a10.816β2-MicroglobulinB2m0.816Connective tissue growth factorCtgf0.825FollistatinFst0.825L1 cell adhesion moleculeL1cam0.828Kallikrein B, plasma 1Klkb10.854Actin, βActb0.866BCL2-like 1Bcl2l10.878Vitamin D receptorVdr0.883Cyclin D1Ccnd10.884Lectin, galactose-binding, soluble 1Lgals10.905Breast cancer 1Brca10.922S100 calcium-binding protein A6 (calcyclin)S100a60.922Forkhead box A1Foxa10.940Myelocytomatosis oncogeneMyc0.971Estrogen receptor–binding fragment-associated gene 9Ebag90.975Nuclear receptor corepressor 2Ncor21.009Nuclear receptor coactivator 3Ncoa31.021Vascular endothelial growth factor AVegfa1.031Aryl-hydrocarbon receptorAhr1.068Metastasis-associated 1Mta11.173X-box–binding protein 1Xbp11.177Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3Socs31.190Scaffold attachment factor BSafb1.203Bone morphogenetic protein 4Bmp41.205PDZ domain–containing 1Pdzk11.214Chemokine (CC motif) ligand 12Ccl121.227Patched homolog 1Ptch11.227Wingless-related MMTV integration site 5AWnt5a1.266Bone morphogenetic protein 7Bmp71.291PrimePCR Reverse Transcription Control AssayRT1.335Wingless-related MMTV integration site 4Wnt41.335Transforming growth factor, β3Tgfb31.345v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2Erbb21.372Nuclear receptor coactivator 1Ncoa11.391Nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1Nr3c11.402Proline-, glutamic acid-, and leucine-rich protein 1Pelp11.403Nuclear receptor–interacting protein 1Nrip11.446Nuclear receptor coactivator 2Ncoa21.449Neuropilin 1Nrp11.460Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferaseHprt1.465Mediator complex subunit 1Med11.591Transforming growth factor, αTgfa1.591v-ral simian leukemia viral oncogene homolog ARala1.615PrimePCR Positive Control AssayPCR1.622Ngfi-A–binding protein 2Nab21.628A kinase (PRKA) anchor protein 1Akap11.690Progesterone receptorPgr1.696Amyloid β (A4) precursor protein–binding, family B1Apbb11.812Insulin-like growth factor–binding protein 5Igfbp51.955Prohibitin 2Phb22.082Matrix metallopeptidase 9Mmp92.168PrimePCR RNA Quality AssayRQ22.170Brain-derived neurotrophic factorBdnf2.255Nuclear receptor subfamily 2, group F, member 6Nr2f62.297Ephrin A5Efna52.598Nephroblastoma overexpressed geneNov2.717Retinoic acid receptor, αRara3.243Snail homolog 1 (Drosophila)Snai14.669Estrogen receptor 1 (α)Esr15.416v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3Erbb312.099 Open table in a new tab Bone marrow (BM) cells from GSTP-null mice proliferate faster (shorter doubling times) and produce more circulating blood cells of all lineages than the WT (17Gate L.

Fig. 1A shows that enhanced proliferation rates in Gstp1/p2−/− cells were maintained when BMDDCs were differentiated from BM precursors in the presence of GM-CSF with incorporation of BrdU used as a marker. Differentiation of DCs is essentially complete at day 6 but can continue until day 9. In our present study, we focused on immature bone marrow–derived dendritic cells (imDCs), therefore we selected cells from days 6 and 8, each representing typical growth of imDCs. During the differentiation of BMDDCs from precursor cells, GM-CSF treatment caused a time-dependent increase in ROS in both GSTP WT and KO cells, and the change was more pronounced in cells from Gstp1/p2−/− mice (Fig. 1B). There was also a shift in the GSH/GSSG ratios toward a more oxidized state (Fig. 1C). We consistently observed that ROS levels were higher in the GSTP KO BMDDCs. It seems that GSH/GSSG ratios drop at the early days (mainly during HSC to DC differentiation from days 0 to 6) and then increase and stabilize during DC cell proliferation (days 6–9). However, the ROS levels consistently increased during the entire period of GM-CSF–induced differentiation and proliferation. In general, the data suggested that GM-CSF induced oxidative stress, causing a disruption in redox balance that was more pronounced in GSTP-deficient cells. In concordance with the comparative array data (Table 1), GM-CSF–induced differentiation of BMDDCs from BM precursors caused a gradual increase in expression of ERα, both at the transcript (Fig. 1D) and protein levels (Fig. 1, E and F). The up-regulation of mRNA is much greater in GSTP KO mice, and the highest levels occur on day 7. However, there is a lag of protein expression versus gene up-regulation, most pronounced after day 7. At early time points, low ERα expression and limited detection capacities of the ERα antibodies meant that we could not detect a band. ERα levels were higher in the Gstp1/p2−/− cells and increased at a faster rate in the time after GM-CSF stimulation. Gstp1/p2−/− cells had detectable protein levels from day 7 onward, whereas Gstp1/p2+/+ cells had detectable protein levels only from day 8 (Fig. 1, E and F). This seemed to be a characteristic of the Gstp1/p2−/− mice because higher resting-state levels of ERα were found in spleen, ovary, and prostate (Fig. 1, G and H). ERα has been suggested previously to play a role in regulating DC endocytosis, maturation, and cytokine secretion and priming T-cell proliferation (18Kovats S.

We performed a series of experiments to measure comparative differences in BMDDC functions between WT and Gstp1/p2−/− mice. The data indicated that higher levels of DC functions occurred in the absence of GSTP expression. As a function specific to imDCs, we measured the capacity to endocytose FITC-dextran via the mannose receptor. Fig. 2, A and B, show that endocytotic functions were higher in Gstp1/p2−/− BMDDCs compared with WT. In response to an agonist of toll-like receptor 4, Gstp1/p2−/− BMDDCs matured normally following LPS treatment as demonstrated by their expression of CD80, MHCII, and CD86 (Fig. 2C). However, expression of these maturation markers was enhanced in LPS-treated Gstp1/p2−/− compared with WT BMDDCs (quantification (arbitrary units) of the MFI values for Gstp1/p2−/− versus WT: CD80, 8884 ± 308 versus 5068 ± 579; MHCII, 70,097 ± 891 versus 55,127 ± 2703; CD86, 39,359 ± 4872 versus 24,085 ± 4552; Fig. 2D). Even in the absence of LPS, Gstp1/p2−/− BMDDCs had higher levels of MHCII (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, following LPS activation, Gstp1/p2−/− BMDDCs produced significantly higher levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-12p70 and less of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 compared with their WT counterparts (Gstp1/p2−/− versus WT: IL-12p70, 371 ± 26 versus 232 ± 13; IL-10, 369 ± 22 versus 577 ± 53). Without LPS activation, IL-12p70 secretion was very low, and IL-10 secretion was undetectable in both WT and Gstp1/p2−/− BMDDCs (Fig. 2E). Finally, we investigated the efficiency with which BMDDCs primed naïve T cells by stimulating carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)–labeled naïve T cells (from Pmel-1 T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice) with hgp100(25–33)-pulsed BMDDCs activated with LPS (mature bone marrow–derived dendritic cells (mDCs)). Fig. 2F shows that naïve CD8+ T cells undergo antigen-specific proliferation when cocultured with either WT or Gstp1/p2−/− mDCs, and higher levels of T-cell expansion were observed when cocultured with Gstp1/p2−/− mDCs. Together, these data show that Gstp1/p2 ablation resulted in a phenotype of enhanced DC endocytosis, maturation, proinflammatory cytokine secretion, and capacity to prime T-cell proliferation. It seemed reasonable to expect that enhanced proliferation rates and DC activation by LPS should be accompanied by changes in cellular metabolism and bioenergetics. To support increased demands for synthesis and transport of proteins required for BMDDC maturation, recent evidence suggests that LPS activation of DCs drives a decline in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and commitment to glycolysis (provides ATP as well as generates lipids for membrane synthesis, including endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi (20Everts B.

To obtain insight into functional differences between WT and Gstp1/p2−/− BMDDC mitochondria, we first mapped mitochondrial function by using a Seahorse Metabolic Analyzer to measure oxygen consumption rate (OCR), an indicator of oxidative phosphorylation, and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), an indicator of glycolysis. For both WT and Gstp1/p2−/− BMDDCs, stimulation with LPS resulted in decreased OCR and an accompanying increased ECAR as compared with control (Fig. 3A). This indicated attenuated rates of OXPHOS and enhanced glycolysis. In addition, following LPS activation, Gstp1/p2−/− BMDDCs had significantly higher ECAR values when compared with WT cells, indicating their higher glycolytic capacity (Fig. 3A). Meanwhile, OCR values were significantly lower in Gstp1/p2−/− BMDDCs compared with WT cells (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, Fig. 3B shows the time-dependent uptake of glucose in BMDDCs. Stimulation with LPS resulted in increased glucose uptake in both WT and Gstp1/p2−/− mDCs. A comparison of glucose uptake rates revealed that Gstp1/p2−/− mDCs were more glycolytic than WT cells. For additional clarification, we used quantitative RT-PCR to measure mRNA expression levels of various glycolysis-associated genes, including Aldoa, Aldoc, Eno1, Eno3, Gck, Gpi, Hk2, Ldha, Ldhb, Ldhc, Pfk, Pgam1, Pgk1, pkm, Slc2a1, and Slc2a4. Among these, our data showed that the mRNA expression levels of several glycolytic genes were severalfold higher in Gstp1/p2−/− BMDDCs (Fig. 3C), including enolase (Eno3), phosphoglycerate isomerase (Pgam1), and glucose transporter 1 (Slc2a1). In addition, the more pronounced up-regulation of protein levels of phosphoglycerate isomerase (PGAM1) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) was confirmed in Gstp1/p2−/− BMDDCs. Due to the availability and sensitivity of antibodies, β-enolase was not detected in this study (Fig. 3, D and E). Increased glycolysis in Gstp1/p2−/− BMDDCs was accompanied by an increased activation of the mTOR pathway. This was assessed by phosphorylation of Akt and decreased activation of AMPK as determined by phosphorylation of AMPK (Fig. 3, F and G). Akt activation promotes the shift to glycolysis and anabolic metabolism required for DC activation and immunogenicity, whereas AMPK activation antagonizes these responses (21Everts B. Pearce E.J.

These results support the concept that ablation of GSTP contributes directly to the shift toward these pathways. Compared with WT, Gstp1/p2−/− BMDDCs had higher endogenous levels of ROS (Fig. 4A) even before LPS treatment. When stimulated with LPS, there was a further increase in ROS coincident with a decrease in both total cellular thiols (Fig. 4B) and cell surface thiols (Fig. 4D), and the G"

High-throughput DNA sequencing methods provide valuable tools for examining these complex interactions, although this remains challenging, as many microorganisms are difficult to isolate, identify and culture. We use two species of planktonic foraminifera from the climatically susceptible, palaeoceanographically important genus Neogloboquadrina, as ideal test microorganisms for the application of 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding. Neogloboquadrina dutertrei and Neogloboquadrina incompta were collected from the California Current and subjected to either 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding, fluorescence microscopy, or transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate their species-specific trophic interactions and potential symbiotic associations. 53-99% of 16S rRNA gene sequences recovered from two specimens of N. dutertrei were assigned to a single operational taxonomic unit (OTU) from a chloroplast of the phylum Stramenopile. TEM observations confirmed the presence of numerous intact coccoid algae within the host cell, consistent with algal symbionts. Based on sequence data and observed ultrastructure, we taxonomically assign the putative algal symbionts to Pelagophyceae and not Chrysophyceae, as previously reported in this species. In addition, our data shows that N. dutertrei feeds on protists within particulate organic matter (POM), but not on bacteria as a major food source. In total contrast, of OTUs recovered from three N. incompta specimens, 83-95% were assigned to bacterial classes Alteromonadales and Vibrionales of the order Gammaproteobacteria. TEM demonstrates that these bacteria are a food source, not putative symbionts. Contrary to the current view that non-spinose foraminifera are predominantly herbivorous, neither N. dutertrei nor N. incompta contained significant numbers of phytoplankton OTUs. We present an alternative view of their trophic interactions and discuss these results within the context of modelling global planktonic foraminiferal abundances in response to high-latitude climate change."

Among the many interconnected factors relating to malaria transmission, weather conditions such as rainfall and temperature are known to create suitable environmental conditions that sustain reproduction and propagation of anopheles mosquitoes and malaria parasites. In Ghana, climatic conditions vary across the country. Understanding the heterogeneity of malaria morbidity using data sourced from a recently setup data repository for routine health facility data could support planning. Methods Monthly aggregated confirmed uncomplicated malaria cases from the District Health Information Management System and average monthly rainfall and temperature records obtained from the Ghana Meteorological Agency from 2008 to 2016 were analysed. Univariate time series models were fitted to the malaria, rainfall and temperature data series. After pre-whitening the morbidity data, cross correlation analyses were performed. Subsequently, transfer function models were developed for the relationship between malaria morbidity and rainfall and temperature. Results Malaria morbidity patterns vary across zones. In the Guinea savannah, morbidity peaks once in the year and twice in both the Transitional forest and Coastal savannah, following similar patterns of rainfall at the zonal level. While the effects of rainfall on malaria morbidity are delayed by a month in the Guinea savannah and Transitional Forest zones those of temperature are delayed by two months in the Transitional forest zone. In the Coastal savannah however, incidence of malaria is significantly associated with two months lead in rainfall and temperature. Conclusion Data captured on the District Health Information Management System has been used to demonstrate heterogeneity in the dynamics of malaria morbidity across the country. Timing of these variations could guide the deployment of interventions such as indoor residual spraying, Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention or vaccines to optimise effectiveness on zonal basis."

Cd decreased the internal space of blood vessels in the placental labyrinth layer and inhibited placental cell proliferation. Several genes of growth factors, such as Vegf-a, placental growth factor, Igf1 and Igf1r, and several genes of nutrient transport pumps, such as Glut1, Fatp1 and Snat2, were down-regulated in placenta of Cd-treated mice. Moreover, Cd evoked placental ER stress. Of interest, NAC alleviated Cd-induced FGR. Additional experiment showed that NAC inhibited Cd-induced impairment of placental development and placental ER stress.

Many techniques exist to measure CO and SV, but are either invasive or insufficiently accurate in clinical settings. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has been suggested as a noninvasive measure of SV, but inconsistent results have been reported. Our goal is to determine the accuracy and reliability of EIT-based SV measurements, and whether advanced image reconstruction approaches can help to improve the estimates. Data were collected on ten healthy volunteers undergoing postural changes and exercise. To overcome the sensitivity to heart displacement and thorax morphology reported in previous work, we used a 3D EIT configuration with 2 planes of 16 electrodes and subject-specific reconstruction models. Various EIT-derived SV estimates were compared to reference measurements derived from the oxygen uptake. Results revealed a dramatic impact of posture on the EIT images. Therefore, the analysis was restricted to measurements in supine position under controlled conditions (low noise and stable heart and lung regions). In these measurements, amplitudes of impedance changes in the heart and lung regions could successfully be derived from EIT using ECG gating. However, despite a subject-specific calibration the heart-related estimates showed an error of 0.0 ± 15.2 mL for absolute SV estimation. For trending of relative SV changes, a concordance rate of 80.9% and an angular error of −1.0 ± 23.0° were obtained. These performances are insufficient for most clinical uses. Similar conclusions were derived from lung-related estimates. Our findings indicate that the key difficulty in EIT-based SV monitoring is that purely amplitude-based features are strongly influenced by other factors (such as posture, electrode contact impedance and lung or heart conductivity). All the data of the present study are made publicly available for further investigations."

Case registers using EHRs from secondary mental healthcare have the potential to deliver large-scale projects evaluating mental health outcomes in real-world clinical populations.We describe the Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust (C&I) Research Database which uses the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) tool to extract and de-identify routinely collected clinical information from a large UK provider of secondary mental healthcare, and demonstrate its capabilities to answer a clinical research question regarding time to diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder.The C&I Research Database contains records from 108,168 mental health patients, of which 23,538 were receiving active care. The characteristics of the patient population are compared to those of the catchment area, of London, and of England as a whole. The median time to diagnosis of bipolar disorder was 76 days (interquartile range: 17-391) and median time to treatment was 37 days (interquartile range: 5-194). Compulsory admission under the UK Mental Health Act was associated with shorter intervals to diagnosis and treatment. Prior diagnoses of other psychiatric disorders were associated with longer intervals to diagnosis, though prior diagnoses of schizophrenia and related disorders were associated with decreased time to treatment.The CRIS tool, developed by the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) Biomedical Research Centre (BRC), functioned very well at C&I. It is reassuring that data from different organizations deliver similar results, and that applications developed in one Trust can then be successfully deployed in another. The information can be retrieved in a quicker and more efficient fashion than more traditional methods of health research. The findings support the secondary use of EHRs for large-scale mental health research in naturalistic samples and settings investigated across large, diverse geographical areas."

In particular, maturation of the gastrointestinal tract in a new environment loaded with potential pathogens, which can predispose neonatal calves to develop diarrhea, and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality during the first 4 wks of life. We aimed to investigate the inflammatory adaptations at a transcriptomic level in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to a mild diarrhea in neonatal dairy calves using RNA isolated from fresh fecal samples. Eight newborn Jersey male calves were used from birth to 5 wks of age and housed in individual pens. After birth, calves received 1.9 L of colostrum from their respective dams. Calves had ad-libitum access to water and starter grain (22% CP) and were fed twice daily a total of 5.6 L pasteurized whole milk. Starter intake, body weight (BW), fecal score, withers height (WH), and rectal temperature (RT) were recorded throughout the experiment. Blood samples were collected weekly for metabolic and inflammatory profiling from wk 0 to wk 5. Fresh fecal samples were collected weekly and immediately flash frozen until RNA was extracted using a Trizol-based method, and subsequently, an RT-qPCR analysis was performed. Orthogonal contrasts were used to evaluate linear or quadratic effects over time. Starter intake, BW, and WH increased over time. Fecal score was greatest (2.6 ± 0.3) during wk 2. The concentrations of IL-6, ceruloplasmin, and haptoglobin had a positive quadratic effect with maximal concentrations during wk 2, which corresponded to the maximal fecal score observed during the same time. The concentration of serum amyloid A decreased over time. The mRNA expression of the proinflammatory related genes TLR4, TNFA, IL8, and IL1B had a positive quadratic effect of time. A time effect was observed for the cell membrane sodium-dependent glucose transporter SLC5A1, for the major carbohydrate facilitated transporter SLC2A2, and water transport function AQP3, where SLC5A1 and AQP3 had a negative quadratic effect over time. Our data support the use of the fecal RNA as a noninvasive tool to investigate intestinal transcriptomic profiling of dairy calves experiencing diarrhea, which would be advantageous for future research including nutritional effects and health conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2784802663,"Vascular calcification is a strong and independent predictive factor for cardiovascular complications and mortality. Our previous work identified important discrepancies in plaque composition and calcification types between carotid and femoral arteries. The objective of this study is to further characterize and understand the heterogeneity in vascular calcification among vascular beds, and to identify molecular mechanisms underlying this process. We established ECLAGEN biocollection that encompasses human atherosclerotic lesions and healthy arteries from different locations (abdominal, thoracic aorta, carotid, femoral, and infrapopliteal arteries) for histological, cell isolation, and transcriptomic analysis. Our results show that lesion composition differs between these locations. Femoral arteries are the most calcified arteries overall. They develop denser calcifications (sheet-like, nodule), and are highly susceptible to osteoid metaplasia. These discrepancies may derive from intrinsic differences between SMCs originating from these locations, as microarray analysis showed specific transcriptomic profiles between primary SMCs isolated from each arterial bed. These molecular differences translated into functional disparities. SMC from femoral arteries showed the highest propensity to mineralize due to an increase in basal TGFβ signaling. Our results suggest that biological heterogeneity of resident vascular cells between arterial beds, reflected by our transcriptomic analysis, is critical in understanding plaque biology and calcification, and may have strong implications in vascular therapeutic approaches."

However, the introduction of two aminoacid substitutions, R332G and R355G, in the human TRIM5α (huTRIM5α) domain responsible for retroviral capsid recognition leads to efficient HIV-1 restriction upon stable over-expression. CRISPR-Cas-based approaches to precisely edit DNA could be employed to modify TRIM5 in human cells. Toward this aim, we used a DNA transfection-based CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing protocol to successfully mutate TRIM5 to its potentially HIV-1-restrictive version by homology-directed repair (HDR) in HEK293T cells. Nine clones bearing at least one HDR-edited TRIM5 allele containing both mutations were isolated (5.6% overall efficiency), whereas another one contained only the R332G mutation. Of concern, several of these HDR-edited clones contained on-target undesired mutations, and none had all the alleles corrected. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of editing the TRIM5 gene in human cells and identifies the main challenges to be addressed in order to use this approach to confer protection from HIV-1."

We show how this modelling framework could be used to assess the effect and the chances of success of hypothetical treatments that are administered at different stages and delay disease development. We demonstrate that the detection of the true efficacy of an AD treatment can be very challenging, even if the treatment is highly effective. An important reason behind the inability to detect signals of efficacy in a clinical trial in this therapy area could be the high between- and within-individual variability in the measurement of diagnostic markers and endpoints, which consequently results in the misdiagnosis of an individual's disease state."

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of with adding organic Zn (alone or phytase inclusion) at the reduced dose to growing male Ross 308 chickens on somatic axis and bone tissue metabolism. 200 one-day old broilers were divided into the negative control group fed diet without Zn or phytase inclusion, positive control group receiving Zn in the 100% of daily recommended dose from ZnO, and two experimental groups fed diet introduced Zn in 25% of daily recommendation as a glycine chelate (Zn-Gly) with or without phytase inclusion (500 FTU·kg-1). Supplemental organic Zn increased bone Zn and Mg content, serum IGF-1, growth hormone and leptin concentration. Additional phytase inclusion increased body weight gain, blood plasma Ca, Fe, Zn and osteocalcin concentration and tibia ash percentage when compared to the Zn-deprived control. Bone geometry, yield and ultimate strengths were enhanced in both organic Zn supplemented groups, and the overall mechanical strength parameters of bone were better in these groups than in the positive control group supplemented with standard dose of inorganic Zn. Also marked improvements in the thickness of articular and the growth plate cartilages as well as real bone volume and thickness of metaphyseal trabeculae were achieved in all broilers fed Zn-supplemented diet irrespective of phytase inclusion, however, the highest cancellous bone mass and the best trabecular structure were noted after ZnO supplementation. In concludion, although dietary organic Zn given to growing broilers in 25% of daily recommended dose improved general bone properties and mechanical strength, the obtained results do not allow to unambiguously state that organic Zn supplementation at this level, even after phytase inclusion, is sufficient for proper bone development."

It is the first release of ProtDataTherm database for analysis and engineering of protein thermostability which contains more than 14 million protein sequences categorized based on their thermal stability and protein family. This database contains data needed for better understanding protein thermostability and stability engineering. Providing categorized protein sequences and structures as psychrophilic, mesophilic and thermophilic makes this database useful for the development of new tools in protein stability prediction. This database is available at http://profiles.bs.ipm.ir/softwares/protdatatherm.

In both rodents and humans, glucose sensing is lost in diabetes and obesity, but the site(s) of impairment remains elusive. Here, we first report that short-term high-fat feeding disrupts hypothalamic glucose sensing to lower glucose production in rats. Second, leptin administration into the hypothalamus of high-fat–fed rats restored hypothalamic glucose sensing to lower glucose production during a pancreatic (basal insulin)-euglycemic clamp and increased whole-body glucose tolerance during an intravenous glucose tolerance test. Finally, both chemical inhibition of hypothalamic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (achieved via hypothalamic LDH inhibitor oxamate infusion) and molecular knockdown of LDHA (achieved via hypothalamic lentiviral LDHA shRNA injection) negated the ability of hypothalamic leptin infusion to enhance glucose sensing to lower glucose production in high fat–fed rats. In summary, our findings illustrate that leptin enhances LDHA-dependent glucose sensing in the hypothalamus to lower glucose production in high-fat–fed rodents in vivo.

The hallmark feature of type 2 diabetes is traditionally viewed as insulin resistance resulting in elevated hepatic glucose production and impaired glucose uptake in peripheral tissues. However, a change in glucose responsiveness as defined as the ability of glucose sensing per se in regulating glucose production and uptake could also potentially contribute to glucose dysregulation in diabetes. For instance, studies conducted in both rodents and humans report that, independent of changes in glucoregulatory hormones during the pancreatic clamps, a doubling of circulating glucose levels inhibits glucose production and stimulates peripheral glucose uptake in healthy conditions (1Rossetti L.

As seen in humans, obese and diabetic rodents such as the leptin-deficient ob/ob mice also display a loss of glucose sensing (5Alonso L.C. Watanabe Y. Stefanovski D. Lee E.J. Singamsetty S.

To date, the site(s) of glucose sensing impairment that leads to glucose unresponsiveness in obesity and diabetes remains elusive. In this regard, a hypothalamic glucose sensing mechanism has been documented to maintain glucose homeostasis in the context of hypoglycemia-induced counter regulation (6Zhu W. Czyzyk D.

However, whether changes in hypothalamic glucose sensing mechanisms dysregulate glucose metabolism in obesity and diabetes remains unclear. Interestingly, direct restoration of leptin signaling in the hypothalamus of the leptin receptor–deficient Koletsky (fak/fak) rats in parallel improves glucose tolerance (8Morton G.J. Gelling R.W.

Based on these collaborative findings of glucose sensing and hormonal action in the hypothalamus, we hypothesize that hypothalamic leptin action enhances the hypothalamic glucose sensing machinery to regulate glucose metabolism in obesity and diabetes in vivo. We first determined whether the hypothalamus is a site of glucose unresponsiveness in the short-term 3-day high-fat–fed model as 3 days of high-fat feeding in rats induces inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and insulin resistance in the hypothalamus and the dorsal vagal complex (10Thaler J.P.

We placed rats that received stereotaxic hypothalamic and vascular surgeries (Fig. 1A) on a high-fat versus regular-chow diet and found that, upon 3 days of monitoring and feeding, the HFD rats became hyperphagic (Fig. 1B) and hyperinsulinemic (plasma insulin levels in ng/ml; HFD, 0.7 ± 0.2 versus regular chow, 2.0 ± 0.3; p < 0.05) but with no differences detected in body weight (Fig. 1C), fat and lean mass (Fig. 1D), and free (mass of water in the bladder) and total water in the body (Fig. 1E). We next administered glucose directly into the mediobasal hypothalamus of healthy chow-fed rats for 6 h and found that, consistent with previous studies (7Lam T.K. Gutierrez-Juarez R. Pocai A. Rossetti L. Regulation of blood glucose by hypothalamic pyruvate metabolism.Science. 2005; 309 (16081739): 943-94710.1126/science.1112085Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), the glucose infusion rate (Fig. 1F) was increased in parallel to a reduction of glucose production (Fig. 1G), but no changes were detected in glucose uptake (Fig. 1H) during the pancreatic (basal insulin)-euglycemic clamps (Table 1). Importantly, repeating hypothalamic glucose administration into 3-day high-fat–fed rats completely failed to lower plasma glucose levels because of the inability of glucose production to be inhibited (Fig. 1, F–H) independently of changes in plasma insulin and glucose levels (Table 1). Thus, we discovered, for the first time to our knowledge, that high-fat feeding disrupts glucose sensing within the hypothalamus, which lowers glucose production in vivo. It remains unknown whether the diet composition and/or the hyperphagic response of HFD is responsible for the impairment of hypothalamic glucose sensing, although it has been documented that the hyperphagic response, but not the diet composition, of HFD is responsible for the impairment of hypothalamic fatty acid sensing mechanisms (15Morgan K. Obici S. Rossetti L. Hypothalamic responses to long-chain fatty acids are nutritionally regulated.J. Biol.

During the pancreatic (basal insulin)-euglycemic clamps, we found that upon coinfusion with leptin hypothalamic glucose infusion retained its ability to lower glucose production, which led to an increase in glucose infusion rate to maintain euglycemia (Figs. 2, A and B), whereas glucose uptake remained comparable (Fig. 2C). Although such pancreatic clamp studies illustrate that leptin is able to restore hypothalamic glucose sensing in lowering glucose production independently of changes in plasma insulin and glucose levels, one would wonder whether leptin can still impact glucose metabolism while the glucoregulatory hormones are allowed to change at will within the circulation. Thus, we next evaluated whether direct leptin administration into the mediobasal hypothalamus of 3-day high-fat–fed rats alters whole-body glucose tolerance during an i.v. GTT (Fig. 2D). Despite the fact that glucoregulatory hormones are allowed to change at will, hypothalamic administration of leptin at a dosage equal to that used in the pancreatic clamp studies is sufficient to increase glucose tolerance during i.v. GTT (Fig. 2E). Collectively, these two sets of data show that hypothalamic leptin administration enhances glucoregulatory control in 3-day HFD-induced hypothalamic glucose-unresponsive rodents. Of note, hypothalamic leptin action remains intact in 3-day HFD rats, consistent with the fact that central leptin delivery activates hypothalamic STAT3 in 3-day HFD rats (16Pocai A. Morgan K. Buettner C. Gutierrez-Juarez R. Obici S. Rossetti L.

To begin evaluating the downstream molecular pathway of glucose sensing that is necessary for leptin to improve glucose sensing, we tested whether lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the hypothalamus is necessary for leptin-glucose action (Fig. 3A). We hypothesize that LDH is the primary downstream target as chemical inhibition of LDH-dependent lactate metabolism in the hypothalamus negates glucose infusion to lower glucose production in healthy rodents (7Lam T.K. Gutierrez-Juarez R. Pocai A. Rossetti L.

We reason that if leptin restores glucose sensing in the hypothalamus to control whole-body glucose metabolism then LDH-dependent lactate metabolism could be a crucial step. These LDH-targeted experiments would also be necessary to ensure that the currently described glucoregulatory effect of hypothalamic leptin infusion with glucose is specifically targeting glucose sensing mechanisms. This is because a previous study has documented that central leptin infusion into HFD rats in pancreatic (basal insulin)-euglycemic clamp conditions comparable to those in the current study still lowers glucose production in the absence of central glucose coinfusion (20Buettner C. Pocai A. Muse E.D. Etgen A.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Rossetti L.

To address whether leptin enhances hypothalamic LDH-dependent glucose sensing mechanisms, chemical and molecular approaches targeted to the mediobasal hypothalamus were used.

Here, we found that infusion of oxamate together with leptin prevented the ability of leptin to enhance hypothalamic glucose sensing in increasing the glucose infusion rate (Fig. 3B) and lowering glucose production (Fig. 3C) without any detectable differences in glucose uptake (Fig. 3D) and plasma insulin and glucose levels (Table 2). Importantly, coinfusion of oxamate with only leptin into the hypothalamus did not negate leptin’s ability to alter glucose kinetics (Fig. 3, B–D). Two important implications are derived from this control experiment. (i) Consistent with previous literature, hypothalamic leptin administration into 3-day HFD rats during the pancreatic basal insulin clamp lowers glucose production (20Buettner C. Pocai A. Muse E.D. Etgen A.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Rossetti L. Critical role of STAT3 in leptin's metabolic actions.Cell Metab. 2006; 4 (16814732): 49-6010.1016/j.cmet.2006.04.014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) in the absence of glucose coinfusion into the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH), indicating that leptin action in the brain lowers glucose production in a hypothalamic glucose sensing–independent fashion. (ii) The presence of oxamate did not negate such leptin-glucose production–lowering effect in the absence of glucose coinfusion, indicating that oxamate administration is selectively blocking the glucose sensing–dependent pathway and that leptin in the brain can also, in parallel, lower glucose production in a hypothalamic glucose sensing–dependent fashion. Thus, LDH-dependent lactate metabolism in the hypothalamus is a necessary step for leptin to enhance glucose sensing.Table 2Plasma insulin and glucose concentrations during the basal and clamp periods relating to Fig. 3HFD glucoseHFD glucose + leptinHFD glucose + oxamateHFD glucose + leptinBasal Insulin (ng/ml)1.5 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.3 Glucose (mm)7.7 ± 0.37.0 ± 0.17.4 ± 0.07.9 ± 0.4Clamp Insulin (ng/ml)0.9 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.31.0 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.1 Glucose (mm)7.1 ± 0.47.3 ± 0.37.2 ± 0.37.0 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab Next, we selectively evaluated the role of LDHA-dependent lactate metabolism by injecting a lentivirus expressing the shRNA of LDHA into the mediobasal hypothalamus of rats. We first confirmed that LDHA expression was reduced by ∼40% in mediobasal hypothalamic tissues harvested from HFD rats injected with LDHA shRNA compared with the mismatch sequence (MM) control, whereas LDHB expression was unaltered (Fig. 4A). Second, we found that hypothalamic glucose versus saline infusion into MM-injected chow-fed rats was equally as effective as compared with non-injected rats (Fig. 1, F–H) to increase the glucose infusion rate (Fig. 4B) and lower glucose production (Fig. 4C), independently of changes in plasma insulin and glucose levels (Table 3). However, hypothalamic glucose infusion failed to alter glucose metabolism in LDHA shRNA–injected rats (Fig. 4, B and C), illustrating for the first time that the hypothalamic LDHA-dependent pathway is necessary for glucose sensing to lower glucose production in chow-fed rats. Although hypothalamic glucose infusion failed to alter glucose metabolism in HFD-fed MM- or LDHA shRNA–injected rats (Fig. 4, B and C) as well, hypothalamic glucose-infused and LDHA shRNA–injected HFD rats also failed to respond to hypothalamic leptin administration to alter glucose metabolism (Fig. 4, B and C). In direct contrast, hypothalamic leptin infusion was effective in restoring glucose sensing in HFD MM-injected rats (Fig. 4, B and C). Glucose uptake and plasma insulin and glucose levels were comparable among groups (Fig. 4D and Table 3). Thus, molecular knockdown of LDHA in the hypothalamus negates the effect of leptin to enhance the glucose sensing mechanism.Table 3Plasma insulin and glucose concentrations during the basal and clamp periods relating to Fig. 4RC + MM shRNA + salineRC + MM shRNA + glucoseRC + LDHA shRNA + glucoseHFD + MM shRNA + salineHFD + MM shRNA + glucoseHFD + LDHA shRNA + salineHFD + MM shRNA + glucose + leptinHFD + LDHA shRNA + glucose + leptinBasal Insulin (ng/ml)0.8 ± 0.20.7 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.41.4 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.31.4 ± 0.30.8 ± 0.01.9 ± 0.4 Glucose (mm)7.3 ± 0.26.4 ± 0.27.2 ± 0.37.2 ± 0.27.3 ± 0.47.0 ± 0.27.0 ± 0.27.8 ± 0.6Clamp Insulin (ng/ml)0.8 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.10.9 ± 0.30.9 ± 0.30.8 ± 0.20.8 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.41.1 ± 0.2 Glucose (mm)7.0 ± 0.26.7 ± 0.36.9 ± 0.67.2 ± 0.56.9 ± 0.16.5 ± 0.57.2 ± 0.37.4 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab The current set of findings collectively indicates that leptin enhances hypothalamic LDHA-dependent glucose sensing to lower glucose production in HFD rats in vivo and highlights several important implications. First, the defects of glucose unresponsiveness in regulating hepatic glucose production and glucose tolerance as previously reported in rodents (1Rossetti L. Giaccari A. Barzilai N. Howard K.

Second, the loss of glucose sensing in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice (5Alonso L.C. Watanabe Y. Stefanovski D. Lee E.J. Singamsetty S. Romano L.C. Zou B. Garcia-Ocaña A. Bergman R.N. O'Donnell C.P.

Importantly, such postulated leptin-dependent rescue of glucose sensing could be due to an enhancement of hypothalamic glucose sensing. However, this postulation must be accepted with caution because central leptin delivery may not restore hypothalamic glucose sensing in rats fed a HFD for more than 5 weeks as central leptin action fails to lower food intake in 5-week HFD-fed rats (25Fam B.C.

https://openalex.org/W2794356169,"Reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibition has been implicated in both anxiety and epilepsy. GAD65-/- (NOD/LtJ) mice have significantly decreased basal GABA levels in the brain and a lowered threshold for seizure generation. One fifth of GAD65 -/- mice experienced stress-induced seizures upon exposure to an open field at 4 weeks of age. In each successive week until 8 weeks of age, the latency to seizures decreased with prior seizure experience. 100% of GAD65-/- mice exhibited stress-induced seizures by the end of 8 weeks. GAD65-/- mice also exhibited marked impairment in open field exploratory behavior and deficits in spatial learning acquisition on a Barnes maze. Anxiety-like behavior in an open field was observed prior to seizure onset and was predictive of subsequent seizures. Immunohistochemical characterization of interneuron subtypes in GAD65-/- mice showed a selective decrease in GABA and neuropeptide Y (NPY) levels and no change in calbindin (CLB) or calretinin (CLR) immunoreactivity in the hippocampus. Stem cells from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) were injected into the hippocampal hilus to restore GABAergic interneurons. One week after transplantation, MGE-transplanted mice demonstrated significant seizure resistance compared to sham surgical controls. The percent area of GFP+ MGE graft in the hippocampus correlated significantly with the increase in seizure latency. Our data indicate that impaired GABAergic neurotransmission can cause anxiety-like behavior and stress-induced seizures that can be rescued by MGE stem cell transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2791742028,"Significant sex specific differences in the progression of HIV/AIDS have been reported. Several studies have implicated steroid hormones in regulating host factor expression and modulating HIV transmission and replication. However, the exact mechanism exerted by steroid hormones estrogen and progesterone in the regulation of HIV-1 replication is still unclear. Results from the current study indicated a dose dependent down regulation of HIV-1 replication in monocyte derived macrophages pre-treated with high concentrations of estrogen or progesterone. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms associated with the down regulation of HIV-1 replication by estrogen and progesterone we used PCR arrays to analyze the expression profile of host genes involved in antiviral responses. Several chemokines, cytokines, transcription factors, interferon stimulated genes and genes involved in type-1 interferon signaling were down regulated in cells infected with HIV-1 pre-treated with high concentrations of estrogen or progesterone compared to untreated HIV-1 infected cells or HIV-1 infected cells treated with low concentrations of estrogen or progesterone. The down regulation of CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 chemokines and IL-1β, IL-6 cytokines in response to high concentrations of estrogen and progesterone pre-treatment in HIV-1 infected cells was confirmed at the protein level by quantitating chemokine and cytokine concentrations in the culture supernatant. These results demonstrate that a potent anti-inflammatory response is mediated by pre-treatment with high concentrations of estrogen and progesterone. Thus, our study suggests a strong correlation between the down-modulation of anti-viral and pro-inflammatory responses mediated by estrogen and progesterone pre-treatment and the down regulation of HIV-1 replication. These findings may be relevant to clinical observations of sex specific differences in patient populations and point to the need for further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2792231779,"This study aims to understand trends in global fertility from 1950-2010 though the analysis of age-specific fertility rates. This approach incorporates both the overall level, as when the total fertility rate is modeled, and different patterns of age-specific fertility to examine the relationship between changes in age-specific fertility and fertility decline. Singular value decomposition is used to capture the variation in age-specific fertility curves while reducing the number of dimensions, allowing curves to be described nearly fully with three parameters. Regional patterns and trends over time are evident in parameter values, suggesting this method provides a useful tool for considering fertility decline globally. The second and third parameters were analyzed using model-based clustering to examine patterns of age-specific fertility over time and place; four clusters were obtained. A country's demographic transition can be traced through time by membership in the different clusters, and regional patterns in the trajectories through time and with fertility decline are identified."
https://openalex.org/W2784715555,"Recent scientific advances have accumulated a tremendous amount of biomedical knowledge providing novel insights into the relationship between molecular and cellular processes and diseases. Literature mining is one of the commonly used methods to retrieve and extract information from scientific publications for understanding these associations. However, due to large data volume and complicated associations with noises, the interpretability of such association data for semantic knowledge discovery is challenging. In this study, we describe an integrative computational framework aiming to expedite the discovery of latent disease mechanisms by dissecting 146,245 disease-gene associations from over 25 million of PubMed indexed articles. We take advantage of both Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling and network-based analysis for their capabilities of detecting latent associations and reducing noises for large volume data respectively. Our results demonstrate that (1) the LDA-based modeling is able to group similar diseases into disease topics; (2) the disease-specific association networks follow the scale-free network property; (3) certain subnetwork patterns were enriched in the disease-specific association networks; and (4) genes were enriched in topic-specific biological processes. Our approach offers promising opportunities for latent disease-gene knowledge discovery in biomedical research."
https://openalex.org/W2784929209,"Interleukin (IL)-33 is a member of the IL-1 cytokine family with dual functions as a traditional cytokine and as a transcriptional regulator. We recently reported that IL-33 up-regulated growth regulated oncogene (GRO)-α/CXCL1 expression in human vascular endothelial cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of IL-33 on the expression of IL-8/CXCL8, another member of the CXC-chemokine family, and to elucidate its signaling pathways in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Immunocytochemical staining and Western immunoblot analysis revealed that IL-33 augmented IL-8 protein expression in HUVECs. Real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that IL-33 significantly increased IL-8 mRNA and secretion in a dose- and time-dependent manner. IL-33 preferentially stimulated proliferating subconfluent cells, and increased IL-8 secretion to a higher level compared with confluent cells. IL-33 also stimulated phosphorylations of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun, and enhanced activator protein (AP)-1 DNA-binding activity, all of which were suppressed by SP600125, a JNK inhibitor. Moreover, IL-33-induced IL-8 mRNA and secretion were also suppressed by SP600125. Transfection of c-Jun small interfering RNA into cultured HUVECs significantly reduced the IL-33-induced increase in IL-8 secretion from HUVECs. The present study demonstrates that IL-33 induces IL-8 expression via JNK/c-Jun/AP-1 pathway in human vascular endothelial cells, and provides a new insight into the role of IL-33-induced IL-8 in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2785106098,"Extensive studies suggested epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has significant neuroprotection against multiple central neural injuries, but the underlying mechanisms still remain poorly elucidated. Here we provide evidence to support the possible involvement of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/ protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathways in EGCG-mediated protection against corticosterone-induced neuron injuries. As an essential stress hormone, corticosterone could induce obvious neurotoxicity in primary hippocampal neurons. Pre-treatment with EGCG ameliorated the corticosterone-induced neuronal injuries; however, it was blocked by pharmacological inhibitors for ERK1/2 (U0126) and PI3K/AKT (LY294002). Furthermore, the results confirmed that EGCG restored the corticosterone-induced decrease of ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT phosphorylation, and attenuated the corticosterone-induced reduction of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) expression and ATP production. Taken together, these findings indicated that EGCG has significant neuroprotection against corticosterone-induced neuron injuries partly via restoring the ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways as well as the PGC-1α-mediated ATP production."

TP53, PIK3CA, NOTCH1, TP63 and CDKN2A were the most frequently mutated genes. Cases were characterized by a low copy number burden with recurrent focal amplification in 11q13.3 and deletion in 15q22. Cases with low SCNAs showed an improved overall survival. We found significant correlations with decreased overall survival between focal amplified regions 4p16, 10q22 and 22q11, and losses in 12p12, 15q14 and 15q22. The mutational landscape in our cases showed an association to both environmental exposures and clinical characteristics.

In the present study, we performed the first miRNA sequencing of otic precursors in human specimens. Using HTG miRNA Whole Transcriptome assays, we examined miRNA expression in the cochleovestibular ganglion (CVG), neural crest (NC), and otic vesicle (OV) from paraffin embedded (FFPE) human specimens in the Carnegie developmental stages 13–15. We found that in human embryonic tissues, there are different patterns of miRNA expression in the CVG, NC and OV. In particular, members of the miR-183 family (miR-96, miR-182, and miR-183) are differentially expressed in the CVG compared to NC and OV at Carnegie developmental stage 13. We further identified transcription factors that are differentially targeted in the CVG compared to the other tissues from stages 13–15, and we performed gene set enrichment analyses to determine differentially regulated pathways that are relevant to CVG development in humans. These findings not only provide insight into the mechanisms governing the development of the human inner ear, but also identify potential signaling pathways for promoting regeneration of the spiral ganglion and other components of the inner ear."
https://openalex.org/W2785128640,"Background Perception of speech rhythm requires the auditory system to track temporal envelope fluctuations, which carry syllabic and stress information. Reduced sensitivity to rhythmic acoustic cues has been evidenced in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI), impeding syllabic parsing and speech decoding. Our study investigated whether these children experience specific difficulties processing fast rate speech as compared with typically developing (TD) children. Method Sixteen French children with SLI (8–13 years old) with mainly expressive phonological disorders and with preserved comprehension and 16 age-matched TD children performed a judgment task on sentences produced 1) at normal rate, 2) at fast rate or 3) time-compressed. Sensitivity index (d′) to semantically incongruent sentence-final words was measured. Results Overall children with SLI perform significantly worse than TD children. Importantly, as revealed by the significant Group × Speech Rate interaction, children with SLI find it more challenging than TD children to process both naturally or artificially accelerated speech. The two groups do not significantly differ in normal rate speech processing. Conclusion In agreement with rhythm-processing deficits in atypical language development, our results suggest that children with SLI face difficulties adjusting to rapid speech rate. These findings are interpreted in light of temporal sampling and prosodic phrasing frameworks and of oscillatory mechanisms underlying speech perception."
https://openalex.org/W2791209024,"Our goal was to describe stomatal conductance (gs) and the site-scale environmental parameters that best predict gs in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. Dominant grass and woody species were measured over two growing seasons in each of four study sites that represented the natural factorial combination of mean annual precipitation [wet (750 mm) or dry (450 mm)] and soil type (clay or sand) found in KNP. A machine-learning (random forest) model was used to describe gs as a function of plant type (species or functional group) and site-level environmental parameters (CO2, season, shortwave radiation, soil type, soil moisture, time of day, vapor pressure deficit and wind speed). The model explained 58% of the variance among 6,850 gs measurements. Species, or plant functional group, and shallow (0–20 cm) soil moisture had the greatest effect on gs. Atmospheric drivers and soil type were less important. When parameterized with three years of observed environmental data, the model estimated mean daytime growing season gs as 68 and 157 mmol m-2 sec-1 for grasses and woody plants, respectively. The model produced here could, for example, be used to estimate gs and evapotranspiration in KNP under varying climate conditions. Results from this field-based study highlight the role of species identity and shallow soil moisture as primary drivers of gs in savanna ecosystems of KNP."
https://openalex.org/W2784740086,"Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is a commensal bacterium of the human gastrointestinal tract, and a pathogen causing infective endocarditis and other biofilm-associated infections via exposed collagen. This study focuses on the characterization of the biofilm formation and collagen adhesion of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus under different conditions. In this study, it has been observed that the isolate UCN 34 is resistant to 20 mg/ml lysozyme in BHI medium, whereas the strain BAA-2069 builds more biofilm in the presence of lysozyme compared to in a control of BHI without lysozyme. A transcriptome analysis with whole genome microarrays of these two isolates in BHI medium with lysozyme compared to control without lysozyme revealed changes in gene expression levels. In the isolate BAA-2069, 67 genes showed increased expression in the presence of lysozyme, while in the isolate UCN 34, 165 genes showed increased expression and 30 genes showed decreased expression through lysozyme treatment. Products of genes which were higher expressed are in involved in transcription and translation, in cell-wall modification, in hydrogen peroxide resistance and in bacterial immunity. Furthermore, the adhesion ability of different strains of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus to collagen type I and IV was analyzed. Thereby, we compared the adhesion of 46 human isolates with 23 isolates from animals. It was shown that the adhesion ability depends significantly on whether the isolate was isolated from human or animal. For example, high adhesion ability was observed for strain UCN 34 isolated from an infective endocarditis patient, whereas strain DSM 16831 isolated from koala feces adhered only marginally to collagen. Full genome microarray analysis of these two strains revealed strain-dependent gene expression due to adhesion. The expression of 25 genes of a transposon and 15 genes of a phage region in strain DSM 16831 were increased, which corresponds to horizontal gene transfer. Adherence to collagen in strain UCN 34 led to higher expression of 27 genes and lower expression of 31 genes. This was suggestive of a change in nutrient uptake."

In this study we have engineered a trivalent Apx fusion protein enclosed in outer membrane vesicles (Apxr-OMV) and studied its immunoprotective efficacy against APP serotypes 1 and 7 challenge in mice. The results showed that the IgG levels in the Apxr-OMVs immune group were significantly higher than those of the negative control (P < 0.05). Up-regulation of both Th1 (IFN-γ, IL-2) and Th2 (IL-4) cytokines were detected in splenocytes of Apxr-OMVs immune group. The survival rates 87.5% and 62.5% were observed against APP strain 1516 of serotype 7 and APP strain 2701 of serotype 1 in the groups of Apxr-OMVs immune group, respectively. Histopathological lesions of the pulmonary structure alveoli were found to be minimal in APX-OMV group challenged with APP serotypes 1 and 7. These results strongly indicated that engineered OMVs could effectively induce specific humoral or cellular immune responses. Moreover, Apxr-OMVs used as novel vaccine provides cross-protective immunity against different serotype 1 and 7 of APP infection in a mouse model. In contrast, the OMV-empty and PBS as negative controls or inactivated strain of APP-2701 and APP-1516 as positive controls for the animal study cannot provide protection or cross-protection."
https://openalex.org/W2791661013,"Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) reactivation is found frequently after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) and is associated with an increased treatment-related mortality. Recent reports suggest a link between HCMV and a reduced risk of cancer progression in patients with acute leukemia or lymphoma after alloSCT. Here we show that HCMV can inhibit the proliferation of the acute myeloid leukemia cell line Kasumi-1 and the promyeloid leukemia cell line NB4. HCMV induced a significant up-regulation of HLA-class-II-molecules, especially HLA-DR expression and an increase of apoptosis, granzyme B, perforin and IFN-γ secretion in Kasumi-1 cells cocultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Indolamin-2,3-dioxygenase on the other hand led only to a significant dose-dependent effect on IFN-γ secretion without effects on proliferation. The addition of CpG-rich oligonucleotides and ganciclovir reversed those antiproliferative effects. We conclude that HCMV can enhance alloreactivity of PBMCs against Kasumi-1 and NB4 cells in vitro. To determine if this phenomenon may be clinically relevant further investigations will be required."
https://openalex.org/W2793773774,"The isotope ratios of Sr are useful tracers for studying parent material sources, weathering processes, and biogeochemical cycling. Mineralogical and geochemical investigations of two lateritic weathering covers, in an area close to the Tropic of Cancer (Guangxi Province, southern China), were undertaken to study the regional weathering processes and Sr isotopic sources. We found that weathering and decomposition of Rb- and Sr-bearing minerals change the Sr isotopic composition in weathering products (lateritic soils). Weathering of illite lowered the 87Sr/86Sr ratio whereas dissolving and leaching of carbonate minerals increased the 87Sr/86Sr ratio. An Fe nodular horizon is widely developed on the top of the weathering covers in the studied area and it differs from the lateritic soil horizon in mineral composition, construction, and elemental concentration. Furthermore, both Fe2O3 and P2O5 (concentrations) are negatively correlated with the 87Sr/86Sr ratios, suggesting fixation of apatite by Fe oxides is a controlling factor of the Sr isotopic composition in the Fe nodular horizon. The 87Sr/86Sr and Nb/Sr ratios imply the contents and proportions of Fe nodules and clay are critical in controlling the changes of Sr isotopic composition in the Fe nodular horizon. The two stages of the weathering process of carbonate rocks are revealed by the87Sr/86Sr versus Nb/Sr diagram. The 87Sr/86Sr and Rb/Sr ratios suggest that Sr isotopes in the weathering covers within the studied area are derived mainly from parent rock weathering and that the contributions from allothogenic Sr isotopes are limited. A comparison of Sr isotopic composition signatures in the weathering covers of the studied area and Guizhou Province provided insight into the Sr isotopic source and paleogeographic evolution of southern China. From the Permian to the Triassic, the continental fragment sources of the South China sedimentary basin changed significantly. In the Permian, Southern China presented the paleogeographic pattern that the north was higher (in elevation) than the south."
https://openalex.org/W2793858545,"Incubation starts during egg laying for many bird species and causes developmental asynchrony within clutches. Faster development of late-laid eggs can help reduce developmental differences and synchronize hatching, which is important for precocial species whose young must leave the nest soon after hatching. In this study, we examined the effect of egg laying sequence on length of the incubation period in Wood Ducks (Aix sponsa). Because incubation temperature strongly influences embryonic development rates, we tested the interactive effects of laying sequence and incubation temperature on the ability of late-laid eggs to accelerate development and synchronize hatching. We also examined the potential cost of faster development on duckling body condition. Fresh eggs were collected and incubated at three biologically relevant temperatures (Low: 34.9°C, Medium: 35.8°C, and High: 37.6°C), and egg laying sequences from 1 to 12 were used. Length of the incubation period declined linearly as laying sequence advanced, but the relationship was strongest at medium temperatures followed by low temperatures and high temperatures. There was little support for including fresh egg mass in models of incubation period. Estimated differences in length of the incubation period between eggs 1 and 12 were 2.7 d, 1.2 d, and 0.7 d at medium, low and high temperatures, respectively. Only at intermediate incubation temperatures did development rates of late-laid eggs increase sufficiently to completely compensate for natural levels of developmental asynchrony that have been reported in Wood Duck clutches at the start of full incubation. Body condition of ducklings was strongly affected by fresh egg mass and incubation temperature but declined only slightly as laying sequence progressed. Our findings show that laying sequence and incubation temperature play important roles in helping to shape embryo development and hatching synchrony in a precocial bird."

https://openalex.org/W2791008328,"Several power allocation algorithms for cooperative relay networks are presented in the literature. These contributions assume perfect channel knowledge and capacity achieving codes. However in practice, obtaining the channel state information at a relay or at the destination is an estimation problem and can generally not be error free. The investigation of the power allocation mechanism in a wireless network due to channel imperfections is important because it can severely degrade its performance regarding throughput and bit error rate. In this paper, the impact of imperfect channel state information on the power allocation of an adaptive relay network is investigated. Moreover, a framework including Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) mechanism is provided to make the power allocation mechanism robust against these channel imperfections. For this framework, the end-to-end SNR is calculated considering imperfect channel knowledge using ARQ analytically. The goal is to emphasize the impact of imperfect channel knowledge on the power allocation mechanism. In this paper, the simulation results illustrate the impact of channel uncertainties on the average outage probability, throughput, and consumed sum power for different qualities of channel estimation. It is shown that the presented framework with ARQ is extremely robust against the channel imperfections."
