https://openalex.org/W2141393790,"The HER-2/neu oncogene is a member of the erbB-like oncogene family, and is related to, but distinct from, the epidermal growth factor receptor. This gene has been shown to be amplified in human breast cancer cell lines. In the current study, alterations of the gene in 189 primary human breast cancers were investigated. HER-2/neu was found to be amplified from 2- to greater than 20-fold in 30% of the tumors. Correlation of gene amplification with several disease parameters was evaluated. Amplification of the HER-2/neu gene was a significant predictor of both overall survival and time to relapse in patients with breast cancer. It retained its significance even when adjustments were made for other known prognostic factors. Moreover, HER-2/neu amplification had greater prognostic value than most currently used prognostic factors, including hormonal-receptor status, in lymph node-positive disease. These data indicate that this gene may play a role in the biologic behavior and/or pathogenesis of human breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2069095254,"Cholinergic neuronal degeneration after axotomy has been proposed to be due to the loss of a retrogradely transported neurotrophic factor, possibly nerve growth factor (NGF). To test this hypothesis, NGF was continuously infused into the lateral ventricles of adult rats that had received bilateral lesions of all cholinergic axons projecting from the medial septum to the dorsal hippocampus. After 2 weeks of NGF treatment, identification of cholinergic neurons by the presence of the biosynthetic enzyme choline acetyltransferase revealed a dramatic increase (350%) in the survival of the axotomized septal cholinergic neurons. Thus, NGF or an NGF-like molecule can act as a neurotrophic factor for these neurons."

https://openalex.org/W1986983782,"The immunoglobulin MOPC167, which binds the transition state analog p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine with high affinity, catalyzed the hydrolysis of the corresponding carbonate 1. MOPC167 catalysis displayed saturation kinetics with catalytic constant (kcat) = 0.4 min-1 and Michaelis constant (Km) = 208 microM, showed substrate specificity, and was inhibited by p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine. The rate of the reaction was first order in hydroxide ion concentration between pH 6.0 and 8.0. The lower limit for the rate of acceleration of hydrolysis by the antibody above the uncatalyzed reaction was 770. This study begins to define the rules for the generation of catalytic antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W4253316735,"Monoclonal antibodies elicited to haptens that are analogs of the transition state for hydrolysis of carboxylic esters behaved as enzymic catalysts with the appropriate substrates. These substrates are distinguished by the structural congruence of both hydrolysis products with haptenic fragments. The haptens were potent inhibitors of this esterolytic activity, in agreement with their classification as transition state analogs. Mechanisms are proposed to account for the different chemical behavior of these antibodies with two types of ester substrates. The generation of an artificial enzyme through transition state stabilization by antibodies was thus demonstrated. These studies indicate a potentially general approach to catalyst design."
https://openalex.org/W1516043257,"Initiation factor eIF-4F, a multiprotein cap binding protein complex, was purified from HeLa cells by m7G affinity chromatography and independently by phosphocellulose column chromatography. The m7G affinity-purified sample contains three major proteins, p220, eIF-4A, and p28 (also known as CBP-I or eIF-4E). The abundancies of these proteins are roughly 2, 10, and 0.8 X 10(6) molecules/cell, respectively. Two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the eIF-4F samples shows that p28 comprises two isoelectric variants, one of which labels with phosphate and disappears when samples are treated with alkaline phosphatase. The 45,000-dalton protein in eIF-4F appears to be identical to eIF-4A. The p220 subunit rarely produces discrete spots on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis; in purified samples it usually forms 3 closely spaced streaks. eIF-4F fractionated by phosphocellulose chromatography separates into forms containing either phosphorylated or unphosphorylated p28. However, both fractions possess similar specific activities in in vitro translation assays for eIF-4F activity. The phosphorylation of p28 decreases upon heat shock when protein synthesis is repressed. The correlation of dephosphorylation of p28 with the inhibition of protein synthesis and the relatively low abundance of the eIF-4F complex suggest that eIF-4F plays a role in the translational control of mRNA binding. Limitations of the in vitro assay system may account for the failure to detect phosphorylation-dependent activity differences."

https://openalex.org/W2035550797,"DNA sequences have previously been identified in the first intron of the mouse Hprt gene that are methylated on the inactive but not the active X chromosome. The temporal relationship between methylation of these sequences and X-inactivation was studied in teratocarcinoma cells and postimplantation mouse embryos: the sequences are unmethylated prior to X-inactivation and do not become methylated on the inactive X in most fetal cells until several days postinactivation. Such inactive X-specific methylation occurs in a significantly smaller proportion of the cells in the extra-embryonic tissues, yolk sac mesoderm and endoderm, than in the fetus. These data suggest that the inactive X-specific methylation of sequences such as those in the first intron of the Hprt gene does not play any role in the primary events of X-inactivation, but may function as part of a secondary, tissue-specific mechanism for maintaining the inactive state."

https://openalex.org/W2087804543,"In an investigation of the mechanism by which brain lesions result in delayed degeneration of neurons remote from the site of injury, neurons within the caudate nucleus of rats were destroyed by local injection of the excitotoxin ibotenic acid. Treatment resulted in the rapid degeneration of the striatonigral pathway including projections containing the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and delayed transneuronal death of neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata. The distribution of nigral cell loss corresponded to the loss of GABAergic terminals. Neuronal death was prevented by long-term intraventricular infusion of the GABA agonist muscimol. Delayed transneuronal degeneration may be produced by neuronal disinhibition consequent to loss of inhibitory inputs. Replacement of inhibitory transmitters by suitable drugs may prevent some forms of delayed neuronal death."
https://openalex.org/W2089921389,"The presurface (preS) proteins of hepatitis B virus are structural components of the viral envelope that may play important roles in virion assembly and infectivity. They are specified by a large open reading frame that includes the coding region for the major surface (S) protein in its 3' half. Translation of the preS proteins initiates upstream from the S region, giving rise to proteins that are composed of the S domain and an additional 163 (preS1) or 55 (preS2) amino acids. Little is known about the biosynthesis and assembly of these proteins. The expression of the S and preS1 proteins was examined by transfecting cultured mammalian cells with viral DNA and injecting synthetic messenger RNA's into Xenopus oocytes. In contrast to the proteins encoded by the S region, the preS1 proteins are not detectably secreted into the culture medium. Furthermore, when the S and preS1 proteins are synthesized together, secretion of the S proteins is specifically and strongly inhibited. The results suggest a unique molecular interaction during secretion of the S and preS proteins that may be important for virus assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2017082184,"While much information exists about the structure and function of the clonally distributed T cell receptor (TCR) αβ heterodimer, little is known about the γ protein, the product of a third rearranging TCR gene. An antiserum to a carboxyl-terminal peptide common to several of the murine gamma chain constant regions and a monoclonal antibody to the murine T3 complex were used to identify products of this TCR gene family in a subpopulation of Lyt2-, L3T4- thymocytes. This subpopulation does not express TCRα or full-length TCRβ messenger RNA. The gamma chain is a 35-kilodalton (kD) protein that is disulfide-bonded to a 45-kD partner and is associated with the T3 complex. Analysis of the glycosylation pattern of this thymic gamma chain revealed that the major variable region gamma (Vγ) gene transcribed in activated peripheral T cells is absent from this subpopulation. The cells that bear this second T cell receptor may therefore represent a distinct lineage differentiating within the thymus."
https://openalex.org/W2066001055,"Systematic oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis within the internal control region of the Xenopus laevis somatic 5S RNA gene identifies three distinct sequence elements that regulate transcription activity: box A, containing the common, conserved class III promoter domain, and two 5S-gene-specific segments, termed intermediate element and box C. Analysis of the individual steps in the formation of the stable initiation complex reveals that the two 5S-gene-specific elements are the main determinants for the stable binding of TFIIIA. In contrast, TFIIIC binding appears to be dependent on interactions with TFIIIA and on direct DNA interactions in box A as well as probably in box C. Alterations of the spacing between the two major promoter domains of from −3 to +10 nucleotides are tolerated, although they reduce transcription activity and were found to prevent the formation of a stable initiation complex."

https://openalex.org/W1588529304,"U6 RNA is an abundant, capped, small nuclear RNA (snRNA) species associated with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins in eukaryotic cells. U4 RNA and U6 RNA are hydrogen bonded in a 1:1 ratio in discrete small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles that are required in pre-mRNA processing. Previous reports have established that the mRNAs and U1 to U5 U-snRNAs are synthesized by RNA polymerase II. Evidence is presented here for synthesis of U6 RNA by RNA polymerase III. The synthesis of U6 RNA in vitro, using Novikoff hepatoma or HeLa whole cell extracts, was not inhibited at low (1 microgram/ml) concentrations of alpha-amanitin, and only 35% inhibition occurred at 10 micrograms/ml concentration. The in vitro synthesized U6 RNA, like other RNA polymerase III transcripts, was associated with La antigen. The U6 RNA synthesized in vitro by the whole cell extracts was capped, but no other internal post-transcriptional modifications were found. Uridylic acid residues were also added post-transcriptionally to the 3'-end of U6 RNA in vitro. U6 RNA, though capped on its 5'-end, is transcribed by RNA polymerase III; this is the first report of a capped RNA molecule synthesized by RNA polymerase III."

Unlike individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia or WHHL rabbits, the affected pigs have normal low density lipoprotein receptor activity. The animals, by 7 months of age, have extensive atherosclerotic lesions in all three coronary arteries. This strain of pig represents an animal model for atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia associated with mutations affecting the structures of plasma lipoproteins. One of the variant apolipoproteins, Lpb5, is apolipoprotein-B. A second variant apolipoprotein (Lpr1), termed apo-R, is a 23-kilodalton protein present in both the very low density (d less than 1.006 g/ml) and the very high density (d greater than 1.21 g/ml) fractions of pig plasma. Isoforms of this protein correlate with two Lpr alleles, Lpr1 and Lpr2. The Lpr genes segregate independently of the Lpb5 and Lpu1 alleles. The Lpu1 allotype is a component of low density lipoprotein and is genetically linked to Lpb5."
https://openalex.org/W2013826171,"The rps12 gene codes for chloroplast ribosomal protein S12. In the tobacco chloroplast genome (156 kbp circular DNA), exons II and III of this gene are separated by an intron of 536 bases and are present in two copies in the inverted repeat region, while exon I is located in the large single copy region at a distance of 90 kb and 126 kb from the two copies of exons II and III. These three exons were artificially combined in cloned DNA fragments and hybridized with tobacco chloroplast RNA. Electron microscopic analysis of RNA-DNA hybrids showed that exon I is transcribed as part of a polycistronic RNA containing upstream and downstream sequences; the same is true for exons II and III. Exon I is shown to be transcribed separately from exons II and III. In the most abundant class of the hybridized RNA molecules, exon I was covalently linked to exon II. In these molecules the sequences downstream of exon I and upstream of exon II are not present. These data indicate that maturation of rps12 pre-mRNAs in chloroplasts of tobacco involves trans splicing."

https://openalex.org/W2069948308,"The MerR protein mediates the induction of the mercury resistance phenotype in bacteria; it has been isolated in order to study the effects of metal-ion induced changes in the metabolism of prokaryotic cells at the molecular level. After DNA sequences responsible for negative autoregulation were removed, the 16-kilodalton protein was overproduced and purified to more than 90 percent homogeneity by a salt extraction procedure that yields about 5 milligrams of protein per gram of cells. Complementation data, amino terminal analysis, gel filtration, and deoxyribonuclease I protection studies demonstrate that the purified merR gene product is a dimer under nondenaturing conditions and that it binds specifically to DNA, in the presence and absence of mercury, at a palindromic site which is directly between the -10 and -35 regions of the structural genes and adjacent to its own promoter. These initial results indicate that MerR is a DNA-binding metalloregulatory protein that plays a central role in this heavy metal responsive system and they delineate an operator site in the mer operon."

https://openalex.org/W1482927441,"Cholecystokinin-58 (CCK-58) is the largest and most abundant, biologically active form of cholecystokinin in canine intestinal mucosa. Despite the high amounts in mucosa, CCK-58 has not been detected in significant amounts in the circulation. The release of CCK-58 into the peripheral blood in response to an intraduodenal perfusion of sodium oleate (9.0 mmol h-1) was studied in seven conscious dogs. Plasma (50 ml) was obtained before and after endogenous stimulation by a newly developed method that prevents in vitro degradation of large cholecystokinins. The relative abundance of immunoreactive forms of CCK was studied by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) which separated the gastrin and CCK forms. Column eluates were measured with an antibody which recognizes the intact carboxyl terminus of both gastrin and CCK. Cholecystokinin immunoreactivity increased over basal in plasma by 7 fmol/ml after intraduodenal perfusion with sodium oleate. The most abundant form of stimulated cholecystokinin immunoreactivity eluted on HPLC in the position of CCK-58 (63% of total immunoreactivity found). Since CCK-58 is biologically active and is the most abundant circulating form, it should play an important role in the physiology of cholecystokinin."

https://openalex.org/W1529102742,"p-Nitrophenyl and cholesteryl-N-alkyl carbamates are good inhibitors of porcine pancreatic cholesterol esterase-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl butyrate. p-Nitrophenyl-N-butyl and N-octyl carbamates (compounds 1 and 2, respectively) are potent active site-directed irreversible inhibitors of this enzyme. The inhibition of cholesterol esterase by compound 1 or 2 shows saturation kinetics with increasing inhibitor concentration. The activity of cholesterol esterase in the presence of compound 1 or 2 can be protected by the competitive inhibitor, phenylboronic acid. First-order decreases in cholesterol esterase activity effected by compound 1 or 2 are also observed in the presence of taurocholate/phosphatidylcholine micelles. Dilution of the inhibited enzyme results in a gradual return of activity, the rate of which is increased in the presence of the nucleophile hydroxylamine. Hence, inhibition of cholesterol esterase-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl butyrate by compound 1 or 2 in the aqueous or micellar phase occurs via a carbamyl-cholesterol esterase mechanism. The turnover of the butyl carbamylenzyme is increased in the presence of micelles, which indicates that the micelles have a direct effect on the catalytic activity of the enzyme. However, this effect is dependent on the structure of the substrate as the turnover of the octyl carbamylenzyme is unaffected in the presence of micelles. A comparison of the second-order rate constants for the inhibition of cholesterol esterase by compound 1 or 2 indicates that the octyl derivative is the more potent inhibitor. Cholesteryl-N-alkyl carbamates do not carbamylate cholesterol esterase but instead act as reversible inhibitors. This is due to the stability of cholesteryl carbamates relative to p-nitrophenyl carbamates."
https://openalex.org/W1576625825,"Inhibition of thrombin by heparin cofactor II (HCII) is accelerated by dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and heparin. Purified HCII or defibrinated plasma was incubated with washed confluent cell monolayers, 125I-thrombin was added, and the rate of formation of covalent 125I-thrombin-inhibitor complexes was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Fibroblasts and porcine aortic smooth muscle cells accelerated inhibition of thrombin by HCII 2.3-7.5-fold but had no effect on other thrombin inhibitors in plasma. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells and mouse macrophage-derived cells did not accelerate the thrombin-HCII reaction. IMR-90 normal human fetal lung fibroblasts treated with heparinase or heparitinase accelerated the thrombin-HCII reaction to the same degree as untreated cells. In contrast, treatment with chondroitinase ABC almost totally abolished the ability of these cells to activate HCII while chondroitinase AC had little or no effect, suggesting that dermatan sulfate was responsible for the activity observed. [35S]Sulfate-labeled proteoglycans were isolated from IMR-90 fibroblast monolayers and conditioned medium and fractionated into two peaks on Sepharose CL-2B. The lower Mr proteoglycans contained 74-76% dermatan sulfate and were 11-25 times more active with HCII than the higher Mr proteoglycans which contained 68-97% heparan sulfate. The activity of the lower Mr proteoglycans decreased 70-90% by degradation of the dermatan sulfate component with chondroitinase ABC. These results confirm that dermatan sulfate proteoglycans are primarily responsible for activation of HCII by IMR-90 fibroblasts. We suggest that HCII may inhibit thrombin when plasma is exposed to vascular smooth muscle cells or fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2074333654,"A DNA sequence related to the abl proto-oncogene was identified in human placenta. Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis revealed two putative exons whose predicted amino acid sequence was most homologous to the corresponding sequences of c-abl and v-abl but was related to other tyrosine kinase genes as well. The new sequence was localized by in situ hybridization and somatic cell genetic analysis to human chromosome 1q24-25, which differs from the location of any previously identified tyrosine kinase gene. The detection of a novel 12-kb transcript by this gene in human normal and tumor cells establishes it as a new member of the tyrosine kinase family that is closely related to but distinct from c-abl."

https://openalex.org/W1481033123,"The optical absorption and ligand binding properties of newly reconstituted sperm whale myoglobin were examined systematically at pH 8, 20 degrees C. The conventional absorbance and magnetic circular dichroism spectra of freshly reconstituted samples were identical to those of the native protein. In contrast, reconstituted azide or CO myoglobin initially exhibited less circular dichroism in the Soret wavelength region than native myoglobin. These data support the theory proposed by La Mar and co-workers (La Mar, G. N., Davis, N. L., Parish, D. W., and Smith, R. M. (1983) J. Mol. Biol. 168, 887-896) that protoheme inserts into apomyoglobin in two distinct orientations. The equilibrium and kinetic parameters for O2 and CO binding to newly reconstituted myoglobin were observed to be identical to those of the native protein. Thus, the orientation of the heme group has no effect on the physiological properties of myoglobin. This result is in disagreement with the preliminary report of Livingston et al. (Livingston, D. J., Davis, N. L., La Mar, G. N., and Brown, W. D. (1984) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 106, 3025-3026) which suggested that the abnormal heme conformation exhibited a 10-fold greater affinity and association rate constant for O2 binding. Significant kinetic heterogeneity was observed only for long-chain isonitrile binding to newly reconstituted myoglobin, and even in these cases, the rate constants for the abnormal and normal heme conformations differed by less than a factor of 4."
https://openalex.org/W1975303421,"Mutations in the X-linked gene sdc-1 affect both sex determination and X-chromosome dosage compensation in C. elegans, providing evidence that these two pathways share a common step. In XX animals (normally hermaphrodites), sdc-1 mutations cause partial masculinization and elevated levels of X-linked gene expression, an apparent shift of both pathways toward their XO modes of expression. The masculinization occurs through effects on the major sex determination pathway, upstream of all previously identified sex-determining genes. XO animals are apparently unaffected by the sdc-1 mutations. We propose a model in which the wild-type sdc-1 activity is either a component of the primary sex-determining signal (the X/Autosome ratio) or involved in transmitting information about this signal to both the sex determination and dosage compensation pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1963505541,"Each subunit of the human transferrin receptor (TR) dimer is inserted into the ER membrane as a transmembrane polypeptide having its N-terminus in the cytoplasm. The transmembrane segment of the molecule serves both as a signal for chain translocation and as a membrane anchor. To study which structural features of this segment are required for its dual function, we have essentially replaced the transmembrane peptide with the C-terminal membrane-spanning segment of two proteins having a separate N-terminal translocation signal and with an artificial uncharged peptide. In each case the mutant TR molecules are efficiently translocated in vitro. In contrast, substitution of the transmembrane peptide of TR with a hydrophilic peptide results in no detectable translocation activity of the mutant TR. This suggests that the hydrophobic character of the transmembrane peptide of TR, rather than its actual amino acid sequence, is important for chain translocation and membrane binding."
https://openalex.org/W2034809560,"We analyzed the significance of DnaA protein binding to the origin region of pBR322. Replication of pBR322 in vitro was stimulated by DnaA protein. Moreover, the primosomal component protein i was no longer essential for replication after addition of DnaA protein, whereas, among others, proteins DnaB and DnaG were still required. Complete replication products were synthesized under these conditions. We constructed pBR322 deletion derivatives missing the primosome assembly sites. Efficient replication of these deletion plasmids was dependent on the presence of DnaA protein and its binding site, but independent of protein i activity. We conclude that DnaA protein binding to the pBR322 origin region substitutes for primosome assembly by directing DnaB, DnaC, and DnaG proteins to the origin. We term this process DnaA-directed pre-replisome formation."

https://openalex.org/W2137874814,"The regression of the ventral prostate, after a rat is deprived of androgens by castration, is accompanied by a marked decrease in the prostate's ability to synthesize RNA and major proteins. Surprisingly, in vitro translation of prostate RNA, isolated from rats 2 days after castration, detects four proteins with Mr of approximately 29,000, 37,000, 46,000, and 49,000 whose message levels increased 4- to 12-fold compared to results from normal rats. According to cDNA dot hybridization analysis, the increase after castration in the level of the 29-kDa protein-mRNA (per unit amount of DNA) was reversed within 6 h by androgen treatment of castrated rats. In contrast, the level of a mRNA in male rat liver, which hybridized to a cloned probe for the prostate 29-kDa protein-mRNA was reduced by castration and increased by androgen treatment. During an in vitro incubation, the ventral prostates of normal rats were much less efficient than the prostates of rats castrated 2 days earlier in synthesizing a 29-kDa protein. Despite the fact that androgenic manipulation of rats induced very rapid and significant changes in the production of the 29-kDa protein and in the level of its mRNA, the cellular level of this protein in the prostate, as determined by radioimmunoassay, was maintained at near normal values throughout the 2-week experimental period. Thus, the prostate appears to have a mechanism, based on androgen repression of certain genes, to maintain the cellular levels of the 29-kDa protein and possibly other structurally or functionally important proteins during both the periods of androgen-dependent growth and the castration-induced regression. The loss of such a regulatory mechanism may result in androgen-independent abnormal prostate growth."

https://openalex.org/W2069402572,A physical theory was developed for mitotic spindle orientation. This is important because spindle position is known to determine the placement of the cleavage furrow separating the offspring of a mitosis. The theory is based on an equation for the force exerted on spindle poles by the interaction of astral microtubules with the cell surface. Expected spindle placements are positions of stable equilibrium where the net force and torque resulting from the action of the astral microtubules on the spindle poles is zero. The theory provides a novel physical explanation of cleavage patterns in the early embryo.
https://openalex.org/W1490507349,"Anthranilate hydroxylase was purified from the yeast Trichosporon cutaneum. This enzyme is a simple flavoprotein which apparently does not require any additional cofactor for the conversion of anthranilate to 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate. Anthranilate hydroxylase has Mr of approximately 95,000, with subunit Mr of 50,000; it contains 2 mol of FAD/mol of enzyme. A number of compounds in addition to anthranilate serve as substrates, or effectors, for this enzyme. Oxygen-labeling experiments show that the oxygen atom at the 3-position of the product, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate, originates from O2, while that at the 2-position is derived from H2O. A mechanism is proposed involving imine formation and hydrolysis during the reaction with the flavin hydroperoxide formed from reduced enzyme flavin and molecular oxygen. This proposal is in accord with the mechanism postulated for other flavoprotein aromatic hydroxylases."
https://openalex.org/W2070246225,"Of 97 nondirected T4 thymidylate synthase-defective (td) mutations, 27 were mapped to the intron of the split td gene. Clustering of these intron mutations defined two domains that are functional in splicing, each within approximately 220 residues of the respective splice sites. Two selected mutations, tdN57 and tdN47, fell within phylogenetically conserved pairings, with tdN57 disrupting the exon I-internal guide pairing (P1) in the 5' domain and tdN47 destabilizing the P9 helix in the 3' domain. A splicing assay with synthetic oligonucleotides complementary to RNA junction sequences revealed processing defects for T4tdN57 and T4tdN47, both of which are impaired in cleavage at the 5' and 3' splice sites. Thus prokaryotic genetics facilitates association of specific residue changes with their consequences to splicing."

Its level in the aqueous phase of chloroform/methanol/water extracts of the tumor is 70 +/- 40 nmol/g, wet weight (n = 4). The presence of a breakdown product of phosphatidylinositol at such high levels in a fast growing tumor may provide an important clue for understanding the metabolic defect that results in the malignant growth of this tumor."
https://openalex.org/W2064993835,"Transformation of C3H10T1/2 cells by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation followed by tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) has been used as a model of two-stage carcinogenesis. However, cells cloned from UV-TPA-induced foci (UV-TDTx cells) had a unique phenotype. Cloned UV-TDTx cells appeared transformed in pure culture but were unable to form foci when cocultured with C3H10T1/2 cells. However, in the presence of TPA, UV-TDTx cells form foci in mixed culture with C3H10T1/2 cells. This phenotype was the only one observed for UV-TPA transformants. These data suggest that (i) communal suppression of cell division is a discrete phenomenon that must be overcome as one step in the multistage process of transformation, and (ii) this protocol permits the routine isolation of transformed cells responsive to density-dependent growth suppression."
https://openalex.org/W1578146858,"Earlier work from our laboratory had shown that vitamin A-deficient rats had increased levels of fibronectin in their serum. To explain this result, we investigated the mechanism whereby vitamin A deficiency affects the production of fibronectin by liver and hepatocytes, since liver is the known source of plasma fibronectin. By use of cDNA specific for rat liver fibronectin, we showed that livers of vitamin A-deficient rats had a 2-4-fold increase in the level of fibronectin mRNA and also a higher transcription rate. Rate of synthesis and secretion of fibronectin was found to be increased 2-fold in primary cultures of hepatocytes of deficient animals. Exogenous addition of retinyl acetate or retinoic acid to the media reversed this increase to control levels. The increase was paralleled by an increase in fibronectin mRNA, also reversed by exogenous retinoic acid. At least 12 h were needed for this reversal to take place. Thus, vitamin A appears to regulate the synthesis of fibronectin through its action on fibronectin mRNA transcription. This represents the first reported observation of an action of vitamin A at the genomic level on the synthesis of a specific protein in liver."
https://openalex.org/W2042307153,"Exchange of small molecules between cells through intercellular junctions is a widespread phenomenon implicated in many physiological and developmental processes. This type of intercellular communication can restore the activity of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in mammalian cells that are deficient in the enzyme UDP-Gal/UDP-GalNAc 4-epimerase. Pure cultures of the 4-epimerase mutant are unable to synthesize normal carbohydrate chains on LDL receptors and many other glycoproteins and therefore do not express LDL receptor activity. When these cells are cocultivated with cells expressing normal 4-epimerase activity, the structure and function of LDL receptors are restored to normal by the transfer of this enzyme's products through intercellular junctions. The formation of functional junctions does not require normal glycosylation of membrane proteins. Because many convenient assays and selections for LDL receptor activity are available, this mutant can provide a powerful new tool for biochemical and genetic studies of intercellular junctional communication."
https://openalex.org/W1489982350,"A pre-steady state kinetic analysis of the stimulation by monovalent cations of the activity of bovine activated protein C (APC) and a proteolytic fragment of APC, des-1-41-light chain activated protein C (GDAPC), toward the substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl p-guanidinobenzoate, has been undertaken. With the cations Na+ and Cs+, at least two cation sites, or classes of sites, on APC were found to be important to the kinetic effects observed. For GDAPC, with both monovalent cations investigated, a single cation-binding site, or class of sites, of kinetic importance was discovered. The most general mechanism that fits all kinetic data was a rapid equilibrium type, with the cation(s) (A) and substrate (S) binding to the enzyme in a random fashion. Cations were found to be essential activators, and only formation of the EAS or EA2S complex led to product generation. For each enzyme, stimulation of the reaction rates was found to be chiefly due to a dramatic enhancement by monovalent cations of the rate constant (k2) for acylation of the enzyme since the dissociation constant (Ks) for enzyme-substrate interactions was increased in the presence of cations, and the deacylation rate constant (k3) was not affected by these activators."
https://openalex.org/W2015642328,"Jeremy M. Berg (1) describes potential
metal-binding domains in nucleic acid-binding
proteins. These metal-binding domains
consist of sequences Cys-X_(2-4)-Cys-X_(4-15)-His-X_(2-8)-Cys. Berg also cites the fact
that proteins known to bind ions have short
sequences of the form Cys-X_(2-4)-Cys, Cys-X_(2-4)-His, or His-X_(2-3)-His. A well-known
DNA-binding protein, histone H3, also has
the conserved sequence Cys-Ala-Ile-His
from residues 110 to 113 (2). The nucleosome
octamer has two histones of each kind
of four histones. These histones are organized
about an axis of symmetry, such that
these conserved sequences on each histone
H3 oppose each other (3). The apposition
of these two histone H3 sequences would
generate a structure potentially able to coordinate
a metal ion, namely 2(Cys-Ala-Ile-His)."
