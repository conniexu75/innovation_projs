https://openalex.org/W2030746296,"An ATP-binding cassette transporter located in the inner mitochondrial membrane is involved in iron-sulfur cluster and molybdenum cofactor assembly in the cytosol, but the transported substrate is unknown. ATM3 (ABCB25) from Arabidopsis thaliana and its functional orthologue Atm1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were expressed in Lactococcus lactis and studied in inside-out membrane vesicles and in purified form. Both proteins selectively transported glutathione disulfide (GSSG) but not reduced glutathione in agreement with a 3-fold stimulation of ATPase activity by GSSG. By contrast, Fe2+ alone or in combination with glutathione did not stimulate ATPase activity. Arabidopsis atm3 mutants were hypersensitive to an inhibitor of glutathione biosynthesis and accumulated GSSG in the mitochondria. The growth phenotype of atm3-1 was strongly enhanced by depletion of the mitochondrion-localized, GSH-dependent persulfide oxygenase ETHE1, suggesting that the physiological substrate of ATM3 contains persulfide in addition to glutathione. Consistent with this idea, a transportomics approach using mass spectrometry showed that glutathione trisulfide (GS-S-SG) was transported by Atm1. We propose that mitochondria export glutathione polysulfide, containing glutathione and persulfide, for iron-sulfur cluster assembly in the cytosol.

The mechanisms that mediate this polarization are not clear. Macrophages are phagocytic cells that participate in the clearance of apoptotic cells, a process known as efferocytosis. Milk fat globule- EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8) is a bridge protein that facilitates efferocytosis and is associated with suppression of proinflammatory responses. This study investigated the hypothesis that MFG-E8-mediated efferocytosis promotes M2 polarization. Tissue and serum exosomes from prostate cancer patients presented higher levels of MFG-E8 compared with controls, a novel finding in human prostate cancer. Coculture of macrophages with apoptotic cancer cells increased efferocytosis, elevated MFG-E8 protein expression levels, and induced macrophage polarization into an alternatively activated M2 phenotype. Administration of antibody against MFG-E8 significantly attenuated the increase in M2 polarization. Inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation using the inhibitor Stattic decreased efferocytosis and M2 macrophage polarization in vitro, with a correlating increase in SOCS3 protein expression. Moreover, MFG-E8 knockdown tumor cells cultured with wild-type or MFG-E8-deficient macrophages resulted in increased SOCS3 expression with decreased STAT3 activation. This suggests that SOCS3 and phospho-STAT3 act in an inversely dependent manner when stimulated by MFG-E8 and efferocytosis. These results uncover a unique role of efferocytosis via MFG-E8 as a mechanism for macrophage polarization into tumor-promoting M2 cells.

Macrophages are activated differentially according to the stimuli provided. M1 antitumorigenic macrophages are defined as classically activated, and M2 protumorigenic macrophages (also known as TAMs) are defined as alternatively activated (7.Pollard J.W.

In addition to their high rate of cell proliferation, tumors have high apoptosis rates, an often forgotten but important process in tumor dynamics (12.Gregory C.D. Pound J.D. Cell death in the neighbourhood: direct microenvironmental effects of apoptosis in normal and neoplastic tissues.J. Pathol. 2011; 223: 177-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The large number of apoptotic cells is underappreciated because of rapid cell clearance performed by macrophages and other phagocytic cells, a process known as efferocytosis. Indeed, not much is known regarding the interactions of apoptotic tumor cells with macrophages and, subsequently, how this affects the remaining viable tumor cells in skeletal metastasis. Efferocytosis elicits changes in immune responses and can result in immunosuppression of antitumor defenses (13.Reiter I. Krammer B. Schwamberger G.

Milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8) is a protein secreted by numerous cells including macrophages and is known as a phagocytosis “eat me” signal (16.Hanayama R. Tanaka M. Miwa K. Shinohara A.

MFG-E8 functions as a tether between macrophage and apoptotic cells via a bimotif function, binding to both phosphatidylserine (PS) externalized on apoptotic cells and the αvβ3/αvβ5 integrin expressed on macrophages (16.Hanayama R. Tanaka M. Miwa K. Shinohara A. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Identification of a factor that links apoptotic cells to phagocytes.Nature. 2002; 417: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). MFG-E8 mutant mice are deficient in efferocytosis, resulting in increased apoptotic cell accumulation, which has been implicated in autoimmunity- and inflammatory-related diseases (18.Miksa M. Amin D. Wu R. Jacob A. Zhou M. Dong W. Yang W.L. Ravikumar T.S. Wang P. Maturation-induced down-regulation of MFG-E8 impairs apoptotic cell clearance and enhances endotoxin response.Int. J. Mol.

Tabas I. Mechanisms and consequences of efferocytosis in advanced atherosclerosis.J. Leukocyte Biol. 2009; 86: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Interestingly, phagocytes activated by their interaction with apoptotic cells via MFG-E8 share similar anti-inflammatory and tumor-promoting properties, as seen in M2 TAMs (7.Pollard J.W. Trophic macrophages in development and disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 12.Gregory C.D. Pound J.D.

Distinct role of macrophages in different tumor microenvironments.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of LPS-stimulated macrophages with rMFG-E8 results in activation of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) via the STAT3 pathway (22.Aziz M. Jacob A. Matsuda A. Wu R. Zhou M. Dong W. Yang W.L. Wang P. Pre-treatment of recombinant mouse MFG-E8 downregulates LPS-induced TNF-α production in macrophages via STAT3-mediated SOCS3 activation.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e27685Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). SOCS3 proteins are known to inhibit the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, creating a negative feedback loop to prevent excessive activation of the pathway (23.Yoshimura A. Naka T. Kubo M. SOCS proteins, cytokine signalling and immune regulation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 454-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). This modulatory role has also been suggested as a mechanism for macrophage polarization. Despite these suggestive links, efferocytosis via MFG-E8 and its role in tumor efferocytosis and M2 polarization has not been investigated in the context of prostate cancer or skeletal metastasis. Given that prostate cancer has a high propensity to metastasize to the bone, which is rich in macrophages and anti-inflammatory factors that contribute to tumor growth, we hypothesized that MFG-E8-mediated efferocytosis modulates the bone marrow-derived macrophage SOCS3/STAT3 pathway, inducing an M2 switch and promoting tumor growth. In this study, the impact of efferocytosis mediated by MFG-E8 on macrophage polarization into M2 TAMs was investigated, and the underlying mechanisms that could be developed as potential therapeutic targets were delineated. All animals were maintained in accordance with institutional animal care and use guidelines, and experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Michigan. MFG-E8 mutant mice were provided by Kamran Atabai from the University of California, San Francisco. Briefly, MFG-E8 mutant mice have an insertion of the pGT1-pfs gene trap vector in intron 7 of Mfge8, trapping the secretory protein, resulting in fusion protein degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum (24.Atabai K. Fernandez R. Huang X. Ueki I. Kline A. Li Y. Sadatmansoori S. Smith-Steinhart C. Zhu W. Pytela R. Werb Z. Sheppard D. Mfge8 is critical for mammary gland remodeling during involution.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5528-5537Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Primary bone marrow cells were collected from male C57BL/6J (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) and MFG-E8 mutant mice at 4–6 weeks of age for in vitro experiments. Mouse bone marrow macrophages were differentiated in vitro from bone marrow cells cultured in α-minimal essential medium (MEM) with 30 ng/ml murine M-CSF (eBioscience) for 6 days. At day 7, macrophages or RAW 264.7 cells were plated into 12-well plates. Cells were treated with recombinant murine MFG-E8 (R&D Systems) at the indicated concentrations. Anti-MFG-E8 (D161–3, MBL International) and IgG control (Dako) were used at 20 μg/ml to treat macrophages in vitro as described previously (25.Jinushi M. Sato M. Kanamoto A. Itoh A. Nagai S. Koyasu S. Dranoff G. Tahara H. Milk fat globule epidermal growth factor-8 blockade triggers tumor destruction through coordinated cell-autonomous and immune-mediated mechanisms.J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Three prostate cancer cell lines were used in this study. Two human bone metastatic prostate cancer cell lines, C42B and PC-3, were obtained from the ATCC. RM-1, a murine cell line, was originally obtained from Dr. Timothy C. Thompson (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). C42B cells, originally derived from LNCaP tumors maintained in castrated and intact athymic male mice, are androgen-independent, metastasize to the bone, and form mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic lesions (26.Lin D.L. Tarnowski C.P. Zhang J. Dai J. Rohn E. Patel A.H. Morris M.D. Keller E.T. Bone metastatic LNCaP-derivative C4–2B prostate cancer cell line mineralizes in vitro.Prostate. 2001; 47: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). PC-3 cells, derived from human vertebral prostate cancer metastasis, are androgen-independent, highly metastatic, and produce osteolytic lesions. Human PC-3 cells were stably transfected to express dsGREEN immunofluorescence. Apoptosis of prostate cancer cells (RM-1, PC-3, and C42B) was induced by overnight serum starvation followed by 24-h treatment with cobalt chloride (RM-1, 150 μm; PC-3 and C42b, 200 μm) (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were washed at least three times with PBS after apoptosis induction and enumerated. A 60–70% range of trypan blue-positive cells was designated high apoptotic (HAP). UV exposure of tumor cells for 20 min in PBS was also utilized to induce apoptosis, avoiding chemical-derived effects. Untreated tumor cells contained 5–10% trypan blue-positive cells and were designated as basal apoptotic (BAP) cells. Mouse GIPZ lentiviral shRNAmir was transfected into RM-1 prostate cancer cells to produce MFG-E8-shRNA stable constructs. Cells were designated as RM-1 m_08 (clone ID V2LMM_277508), RM-1 m_30 (clone ID V2LMM_39830), RM-1 m_41 (clone ID V3LMM_432041), RM-1 m_43 (clone ID V3LMM_432043), RM-1 m_45 (clone ID V3LMM_432045), and RM-1 GIPZ scramble control (Lenti-pGipZ-scramble-VSVG, University of Michigan Vector Core). RAW 264.7 cells or primary bone marrow macrophages were plated at 50,000 cells/cm2 and incubated at different time points with low or high apoptotic prostate cancer cells (RM-1, PC-3, and C42b) at a 1:3 ratio of macrophage to tumor cells or carboxylated fluorescent beads (Bangs Laboratories, Inc.) at a 1:2 ratio. Cells were washed with PBS, and attached cells were collected for further analyses. Bone marrow macrophages, RAW 264.7 cells and prostate cancer cells were stained with 0.2 μl/ml orange or green CellTrackerTM or CellTraceTM carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (Invitrogen) for 20 min in serum-free medium, followed by incubation in complete medium for 60 min. Macrophages were plated in 1.5-mm coverglass chambers for confocal microscopy. High apoptotic cancer cells or carboxylated fluorescent beads were added at a 1:1 or 1:2 ratio to the attached macrophages for up to 24 h and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 20 min. Cells were then washed with PBS and covered with Vectashield® mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Confocal microscopy images were analyzed using the Leica inverted SP5X confocal microscope system with two-photon film and Leica software (Leica Microsystems, Germany). Flow cytometry was performed as described previously (27.Cho S.W. Pirih F.Q. Koh A.J. Michalski M. Eber M.R. Ritchie K. Sinder B. Oh S. Al-Dujaili S.A. Lee J. Kozloff K. Danciu T. Wronski T.J.

Briefly, cells were collected in FACS buffer (PBS, 2% FBS, and 2 mm EDTA), and 1 million cells were stained for 30 min with the following macrophage-specific antibodies: F4/80 Alexa Fluor 647 (Abcam, CI:A3-1) and CD206 PE (AbD Serotec, MR5D3). Cells were fixed and permeabilized with LeucopermTM (AbD Serotec) and incubated with anti-Ym1 rabbit antibody (StemCell Technologies, catalog no. 01404). Cells were then incubated with secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 700 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) 700. For confirmation of apoptosis, prostate cancer cells were stained with the FITC annexin V apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences). After antibody incubation, cells were washed twice with FACS buffer, fixed with 1% formalin, and evaluated for FACS analyses (BD FACSAriaTM III). For protein collection, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed with CelLyticTM MT (Sigma). SDS-PAGE was performed in 4–20% gradient Novex Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) loaded with 50 μg of protein/well. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to membranes (Duralon UV membrane, Stratagene) and blocked in 5% milk for 20 min. The membranes were then incubated with the primary antibody in 5% milk overnight on a shaker at 4 °C. Antibodies against β-actin (C4) 1:50,000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), SOCS3 (1:500 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-STAT3 (3E2) and STAT3 (124H6, 1:1000 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology), and MFG-E8 (1:500, R&D Systems) were used. After washing, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies, washed, and then chemiluminescence (via SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate, Thermo Scientific) was imaged on x-ray film. Protein quantification was performed using the Scion Image software and calculated relative to control protein expression (β-actin). RNA isolation was performed as described previously (28.Koh A.J. Novince C.M. Li X. Wang T. Taichman R.S. McCauley L.K. An irradiation-altered bone marrow microenvironment impacts anabolic actions of PTH.Endocrinology. 2011; 152: 4525-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was synthesized using 0.5 μg of total RNA in 50 μl of reaction volume using the TaqMan reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the ABI PRISM 7700 using a ready-to-use mix of primers and FAM-labeled probe assay systems (Applied Biosystems) for Il10 (Mm00439614_m1), transforming growth factor β1 (Tgf-β1, Mm03024053_m1), Ym1 (Chi3l3, Mm00657889_mH), and arginase 1 (Arg1, Mm00475988_m1). GAPDH (Gapdh, Mm99999915_g1) was used as an internal reference, and the ΔΔCT method was used to calculate the data as described previously (29.Novince C.M. Michalski M.N. Koh A.J. Sinder B.P. Entezami P. Eber M.R. Pettway G.J. Rosol T.J. Wronski T.J. Kozloff K.M. McCauley L.K. Proteoglycan 4: a dynamic regulator of skeletogenesis and parathyroid hormone skeletal anabolism.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2012; 27: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A prostate cancer tissue microarray (TMA) was obtained through the rapid autopsy program at the University of Michigan Prostate Cancer Specialized Program of Research Excellence Tissue Core. The institutional review board at the University of Michigan approved the use of all tissues. A total of 30 benign (n = 12) and malignant (n = 18) paraffin-embedded tissue specimens were analyzed with a Gleason score of 7 to 8. Areas of malignant and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were taken from the same patients (matched paired tissues). Immunohistochemical detection of human MFG-E8 and CD68 (KP1) was carried out in deparaffinized and rehydrated sections using the HRP-AEC cell and tissue staining kit (R&D Systems) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Tissue was permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-mouse CD68 (1:200) and anti-human MFG-E8 (1:50) (Abcam). Samples were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted with paramount aqueous mounting medium (Dako). Negative controls were used to detect nonspecific staining. MFG-E8 staining was quantified using NIS Elements software (Nikon). Briefly, the region of interest tool was used to set the target area that was positively stained for MFG-E8 over the total area (percent) of the tissue. The mean area positive for MFG-E8 was then calculated for each tissue within three different areas of tissue. The proximity of CD68+ cells to MFG-E8 expression was determined by analyzing three tissue sections at ×100 magnification per specimen per TMA. Cells overlapping or in close proximity that were positive for both CD68 (macrophage) and MFG-E8 expression were quantified using ImageJ software. Serum samples were obtained from subjects through a protocol approved by the University of Michigan institutional review board. Blood serum was isolated from patients with primary (n = 6), metastatic prostate cancer (n = 7), or control tumor-free (n = 3). Human serum was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min, after which the resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. Exosomes were then harvested by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 70 min (Sorvall S100-AT5 rotor). The exosome pellet was resuspended in PBS, filtered through 0.2-μm nylon filters (GE) and collected by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 70 min. Exosomes were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (Millipore, Billerica, MA) containing a complete protease inhibitor tablet (Sigma). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min. 50 μg of protein was loaded in 4–20% gradient Novex Tris-glycine gels, and Western blot analysis was performed as described above. MFG-E8 protein expression was quantified using the Scion Image software and calculated relative to control GAPDH. Bone marrow macrophages were plated into 6-well dishes (3 × 106 cells/well). After 24 h, cells were washed with PBS, and 1% FBS α-minimal essential medium was added to the wells with or without high apoptotic RM-1 cells at a 1:1 ratio. The supernatant was collected after 24 h, and proteins were analyzed using the mouse inflammation antibody array C1 (catalog no. AAM-INF-1–8, RayBiotech, Inc.) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Statistical analysis was performed by unpaired Student's t test to compare two groups with a significance of p < 0.05. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. MFG-E8 has been correlated with tumor growth and progression of different types of cancers, such as melanoma and breast cancer, but its expression in prostate cancer is still unclear. To elucidate the pattern of MFG-E8 in prostate cancer, immunohistochemistry was performed on serial sections of prostate cancer patient-derived TMAs containing a total of 30 benign (n = 12) and malignant (n = 18) tissue specimens combined (Fig. 1, A and B). MFG-E8 expression was significantly higher in malignant (31.93% ± 1.27) compared with benign (4.89% ± 0.68) tissues (Fig. 1A). MFG-E8 appeared to be localized on the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm. However, invasive specimens revealed intense MFG-E8 at the leading edge of tumors and in the apical and basal areas of luminal epithelial cells. The proximity of CD68+ cells to MFG-E8 expression was determined to be two times higher in malignant specimens (Fig. 1B). The increased proximity of CD68+ cells in areas of high MFG-E8 expression indicates a potential interaction between MFG-E8 and macrophages in prostate cancer. Protein expression levels were investigated in blood exosomes isolated from patients with prostate cancer or non-cancer controls (Fig. 1C). Blood was collected from patients with localized primary prostate cancer or castration-resistant cancer patients with metastases (30.Vlassov A.V. Magdaleno S. Setterquist R. Conrad R. Exosomes: current knowledge of their composition, biological functions, and diagnostic and therapeutic potentials.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1820: 940-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses revealed that MFG-E8 levels were increased significantly in patients that presented with primary and metastatic prostate cancer. Taken together, these data suggest that MFG-E8 is a potential marker for prostate cancer progression. MFG-E8 is a protein that mediates the interaction of macrophages and apoptotic cells, thereby facilitating efferocytosis. To evaluate efferocytosis of apoptotic tumor cells by macrophages, bone marrow macrophages were cultured with tumor cells, and efferocytosis was investigated. RM-1 cells stained with Cell Tracker dye (CFSE+ green) and treated with CoCl2 to induce apoptosis were designated as HAP cells (>60% apoptosis). Untreated cells (<10% apoptosis) were designated as BAP cells and used as controls. Fig. 2A shows representative confocal microscopic images of macrophages (red) coincubated with RM-1 cells (CFSE+ green). Efferocytosis was quantified relative to the number of nuclei (DAPI) and was increased significantly when macrophages were cultured with HAP cells versus control BAP tumor cells (Fig. 2B). Confocal microscopic images of bone marrow macrophages confirmed efferocytosis as shown in supplemental Movies 1 and 2 (Z stack videos). Increased efferocytosis of HAP cells compared with control (BAP) cells was also observed by flow cytometry quantification. F4/80+ bone marrow macrophages that engulfed CFSE+ tumor cells were analyzed as shown in Fig. 2C. Efferocytosis was also analyzed in unstained RAW 264.7 (RAW) macrophages that were cocultured with RM-1 HAP or BAP for 5 h. Efferocytosis of RM-1 cells by macrophages was measured by flow cytometric analysis on the basis of RAW cell engulfment of Cell Tracker-stained RM-1 cells (Fig. 2D). Efferocytosis was increased when macrophages were cultured with RM-1 HAP compared with control BAP tumor cells. MFG-E8 functions as a facilitator of efferocytosis, binding to PS expressed on apoptotic cells and to the αvβ3/αvβ5 integrin expressed on macrophages (16.Hanayama R. Tanaka M. Miwa K. Shinohara A. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Identification of a factor that links apoptotic cells to phagocytes.Nature. 2002; 417: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). To determine whether increased efferocytosis would affect MFG-E8 expression in macrophages, RAW cells were cultured with low or high apoptotic tumor cells at different time points, and MFG-E8 protein expression was determined (Fig. 2E). Western blot analyses showed that MFG-E8 protein expression increased over time and was augmented when cells were cultured with HAP tumor cells. Taken together, these data suggest that coincubation of macrophages with apoptotic tumor cells elicits efferocytosis and increased MFG-E8 levels. Although MFG-E8 is expressed in many tissues and cells, its expression in prostate cancer cell lines has remained unknown (31.Aziz M. Jacob A. Matsuda A. Wang P. Review: milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 expression, function and plausible signal transduction in resolving inflammation.Apoptosis. 2011; 16: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To determine whether MFG-E8 is expressed in prostate cancer cells, protein was collected and analyzed from RAW 264.7 macrophages and three different prostate cancer cell lines: a prostate cancer murine-derived cell line, RM-1, and two bone metastatic human-derived cell lines, PC-3 and C42B (Fig. 3A). MFG-E8 expression was increased in HAP versus BAP RM-1 cells but did not change significantly for HAP PC-3 and C42b cells versus BAP cells. Overall, all cell lines tested hig"

To investigate the physiological consequences of severe mitochondrial impairment in adipose tissue, we generated mice deficient in mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) in adipocytes by using mice carrying adiponectin-Cre and TFAM floxed alleles. These adiponectin TFAM-knockout (adipo-TFAM-KO) mice had a 75–81% reduction in TFAM in the subcutaneous and intra-abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) and interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT), causing decreased expression and enzymatic activity of proteins in complexes I, III, and IV of the electron transport chain (ETC). This mitochondrial dysfunction led to adipocyte death and inflammation in WAT and a whitening of BAT. As a result, adipo-TFAM-KO mice were resistant to weight gain, but exhibited insulin resistance on both normal chow and high-fat diets. These lipodystrophic mice also developed hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and cardiac dysfunction. Thus, isolated mitochondrial dysfunction in adipose tissue can lead a syndrome of lipodystrophy with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular complications.—Vernochet, C., Damilano, F., Mourier, A., Bezy, O., Mori, M.

https://openalex.org/W1979839897,"Phytochromes are multidomain photoswitches that drive light perception in plants and microorganisms by coupling photoreversible isomerization of their bilin chromophore to various signaling cascades. How changes in bilin conformation affect output by these photoreceptors remains poorly resolved and might include several species-specific routes. Here, we present detailed three-dimensional models of the photosensing module and a picture of an entire dimeric photoreceptor through structural analysis of the Deinococcus radiodurans phytochrome BphP assembled with biliverdin (BV). A 1.16-Å resolution crystal structure of the bilin-binding pocket in the dark-adapted red light-absorbing state illuminated the intricate network of bilin/protein/water interactions and confirmed the protonation and ZZZssa conformation of BV. Structural and spectroscopic comparisons with the photochemically compromised D207A mutant revealed that substitutions of Asp-207 allow inclusion of cyclic porphyrins in addition to BV. A crystal structure of the entire photosensing module showed a head-to-head, twisted dimeric arrangement with bowed helical spines and a hairpin protrusion connecting the cGMP phosphodiesterase/adenylyl cyclase/FhlA (GAF) and phytochrome-specific (PHY) domains. A key conserved hairpin feature is its anti-parallel, two β-strand stem, which we show by mutagenesis to be critical for BphP photochemistry. Comparisons of single particle electron microscopic images of the full-length BphP dimer in the red light-absorbing state and the photoactivated far-red light-absorbing state revealed a large scale reorientation of the PHY domain relative to the GAF domain, which alters the position of the downstream histidine kinase output module. Together, our data support a toggle model whereby bilin photoisomerization alters GAF/PHY domain interactions through conformational modification of the hairpin, which regulates signaling by impacting the relationship between sister output modules."
https://openalex.org/W2050162155,"Paternal health cues are able to program the health of the next generation however the mechanism for this transmission is unknown. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are increased in many paternal pathologies, some of which program offspring health, and are known to induce DNA damage and alter the methylation pattern of chromatin. We therefore investigated whether a chemically induced increase of ROS in sperm impairs embryo, pregnancy and offspring health. Mouse sperm was exposed to 1500 µM of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which induced oxidative damage, however did not affect sperm motility or the ability to bind and fertilize an oocyte. Sperm treated with H2O2 delayed on-time development of subsequent embryos, decreased the ratio of inner cell mass cells (ICM) in the resulting blastocyst and reduced implantation rates. Crown-rump length at day 18 of gestation was also reduced in offspring produced by H2O2 treated sperm. Female offspring from H2O2 treated sperm were smaller, became glucose intolerant and accumulated increased levels of adipose tissue compared to control female offspring. Interestingly male offspring phenotype was less severe with increases in fat depots only seen at 4 weeks of age, which was restored to that of control offspring later in life, demonstrating sex-specific impacts on offspring. This study implicates elevated sperm ROS concentrations, which are common to many paternal health pathologies, as a mediator of programming offspring for metabolic syndrome and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2081369737,"Ca2+ flux into mitochondria is an important regulator of cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals, energy production and cell death pathways. Ca2+ uptake can occur through the recently discovered mitochondrial uniporter channel (MCU) but whether the MCU is involved in shaping Ca2+ signals and downstream responses to physiological levels of receptor stimulation is unknown. Here, we show that modest stimulation of leukotriene receptors with the pro-inflammatory signal LTC4 evokes a series of cytoplasmic Ca2+ oscillations that are rapidly and faithfully propagated into mitochondrial matrix. Knockdown of MCU or mitochondrial depolarisation, to reduce the driving force for Ca2+ entry into the matrix, prevents the mitochondrial Ca2+ rise and accelerates run down of the oscillations. The loss of cytoplasmic Ca2+ oscillations appeared to be a consequence of enhanced Ca2+-dependent inactivation of InsP3 receptors, which arose from the loss of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering. Ca2+ dependent gene expression in response to leukotriene receptor activation was suppressed following knockdown of the MCU. In addition to buffering Ca2+ release, mitochondria also sequestrated Ca2+ entry through store-operated Ca2+ channels and this too was prevented following loss of MCU. MCU is therefore an important regulator of physiological pulses of cytoplasmic Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W2081803015,"The serum levels of several metabolites are significantly altered in schizophrenia patients. In this study, we performed a targeted analysis of 34 candidate metabolites in schizophrenia patients (n = 25) and compared them with those in age- and gender-matched healthy subjects (n = 27). Orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis revealed that complete separation between controls and patients was achieved based on these metabolites. We found that the levels of γ-glutamylcysteine (γ-GluCys), linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, D-serine, 3-hydroxybutyrate, glutathione (GSH), 5-hydroxytryptamine, threonine, and tyrosine were significantly lower, while D-lactate, tryptophan, kynurenine, and glutamate levels were significantly higher in schizophrenia patients compared to controls. Using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, and the area under curve of γ-GluCys, a precursor of GSH, and D-lactate, a terminal metabolite of methylglyoxal, were 88.00%, 81.48%, and 0.8874, and 88.00%, 77.78%, and 0.8415, respectively. In addition, serum levels of D-lactate were negatively correlated with γ-GluCys levels in patients, but not in controls. The present results suggest that oxidative stress-induced damage may be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2090160141,"Metabolic diseases result from multiple genetic and environmental factors. We report here that one manner in which environmental factors can contribute to metabolic disease progression is through modification to chromatin. We demonstrate that high fat diet leads to chromatin remodeling in the livers of C57BL/6J mice, as compared with mice fed a control diet, and that these chromatin changes are associated with changes in gene expression. We further show that the regions of greatest variation in chromatin accessibility are targeted by liver transcription factors, including HNF4α, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (CEBP/α), and FOXA1. Repeating the chromatin and gene expression profiling in another mouse strain, DBA/2J, revealed that the regions of greatest chromatin change are largely strain-specific and that integration of chromatin, gene expression, and genetic data can be used to characterize regulatory regions. Our data indicate dramatic changes in the epigenome due to diet and demonstrate strain-specific dynamics in chromatin remodeling."

Previous studies in chronic kidney disease have failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of vitamin D on arterial stiffness, left ventricular mass and inflammation but none have assessed the effect of vitamin D on microcirculatory endothelial function.We conducted a randomised controlled trial of 38 patients with non diabetic chronic kidney disease stage 3-4 and concomitant vitamin D deficiency (<16 ng/dl) who received oral ergocalciferol (50,000 IU weekly for one month followed by 50,000 IU monthly) or placebo over 6 months. The primary outcome was change in microcirculatory function measured by laser Doppler flowmetry after iontophoresis of acetylcholine. Secondary endpoints were tissue advanced glycation end products, sublingual functional capillary density and flow index as well as macrovascular parameters. Parallel in vitro experiments were conducted to determine the effect of ergocalciferol on cultured human endothelial cells.Twenty patients received ergocalciferol and 18 patients received placebo. After 6 months, there was a significant improvement in the ergocalciferol group in both endothelium dependent microcirculatory vasodilatation after iontophoresis of acetylcholine (p = 0.03) and a reduction in tissue advanced glycation end products (p = 0.03). There were no changes in sublingual microcirculatory parameters. Pulse pressure (p = 0.01) but not aortic pulse wave velocity was reduced. There were no significant changes in bone mineral parameters, blood pressure or left ventricular mass index suggesting that ergocalciferol improved endothelial function independently of these parameters. In parallel experiments, expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and activity were increased in human endothelial cells in a dose dependent manner.Ergocalciferol improved microcirculatory endothelial function in patients with chronic kidney disease and concomitant vitamin D deficiency.

https://openalex.org/W1973333445,"TBPB and 77-LH-28-1 are selective agonists of the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) that may gain their selectivity through a bitopic mechanism, interacting concomitantly with the orthosteric site and part of an allosteric site. The current study combined site-directed mutagenesis, analytical pharmacology,and molecular modeling to gain further insights into the structural basis underlying binding and signaling by these agonists. Mutations within the orthosteric binding site caused similar reductions in affinity and signaling efficacy for both selective and prototypical orthosteric ligands. In contrast, the mutation of residues within transmembrane helix (TM) 2 and the second extracellular loop (ECL2) discriminated between the different classes of ligand. In particular, ECL2 appears to be involved in the selective binding of bitopic ligands and in coordinating biased agonism between intracellular calcium mobilization and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Molecular modeling of the interaction between TBPB and the M1 mAChR revealed a binding pose predicted to extend from the orthosteric site up toward a putative allosteric site bordered by TM2, TM3, and TM7, thus consistent with a bitopic mode of binding. Overall, these findings provide valuable structural and mechanistic insights into bitopic ligand actions and receptor activation and support a role for ECL2 in dictating the active states that can be adopted by a G protein-coupled receptor. This may enable greater selective ligand design and development for mAChRs and facilitate improved identification of bitopic ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2013101012,"Dragonflies are good indicators of environmental health and biodiversity. Most studies addressing dragonfly ecology have focused on the importance of aquatic habitats, while the value of surrounding terrestrial habitats has often been overlooked. However, species associated with temporary aquatic habitats must persist in terrestrial environments for long periods. Little is known about the importance of terrestrial habitat patches for dragonflies, or about other factors that initiate or influence dispersal behaviour. The aim of this study was to reveal the relationship between population dynamics of the threatened dragonfly species Sympetrum depressiusculum at its natal site and its dispersal behaviour or routine movements within its terrestrial home range. We used a mark–release–recapture method (marking 2,881 adults) and exuviae collection with the Jolly–Seber model and generalized linear models to analyse seasonal and spatial patterns of routine movement in a heterogeneous Central European landscape. Our results show that utilisation of terrestrial habitat patches by adult dragonflies is not random and may be relatively long term (approximately 3 mo). Adult dragonflies were present only in areas with dense vegetation that provided sufficient resources; the insects were absent from active agricultural patches (p = 0.019). These findings demonstrate that even a species tightly linked to its natal site utilises an area that is several orders of magnitude larger than the natal site. Therefore, negative trends in the occurrence of various dragonfly species may be associated not only with disturbances to their aquatic habitats, but also with changes in the surrounding terrestrial landscape."
https://openalex.org/W2077153806,"It is well established that widely expressed PTK7 is essential for vertebrate tissue morphogenesis. In cancer, the functionality of PTK7 is selectively regulated by membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), ADAMs (a disintegrin domain and metalloproteinases), and γ-secretase proteolysis. Here, we established that the full-length membrane PTK7, its Chuzhoi mutant with the two functional MT1-MMP cleavage sites, and its L622D mutant with the single inactivated MT1-MMP cleavage site differentially regulate cell motility in a two-dimensional versus three-dimensional environment. We also demonstrated that in polarized cancer cells, the levels of PTK7 expression and proteolysis were directly linked to the structure and kinetics of cell protrusions, including lamellipodia and invadopodia. In the functionally relevant and widely accepted animal models of metastasis, mouse and chick embryo models, both the overexpression and knock-out of PTK7 in HT1080 cells abrogated metastatic dissemination. Our analysis of human tissue specimens confirmed intensive proteolysis of PTK7 in colorectal cancer tumors, but not in matching normal tissue. Our results provide convincing evidence that both PTK7 expression and proteolysis, rather than the level of the cellular full-length PTK7 alone, contribute to efficient directional cell motility and metastasis in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2086838474,"To better understand the soil carbon dynamics and cycling in terrestrial ecosystems in response to environmental changes, we studied soil respiration, litter decomposition, and their relations to soil temperature and soil water content for 18-months (Aug. 2010–Jan. 2012) in three different-aged Pinus massoniana forests in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China. Across the experimental period, the mean total soil respiration and litter respiration were 1.94 and 0.81, 2.00 and 0.60, 2.19 and 0.71 µmol CO2 m−2 s−1, and the litter dry mass remaining was 57.6%, 56.2% and 61.3% in the 20-, 30-, and 46-year-old forests, respectively. We found that the temporal variations of soil respiration and litter decomposition rates can be well explained by soil temperature at 5 cm depth. Both the total soil respiration and litter respiration were significantly positively correlated with the litter decomposition rates. The mean contribution of the litter respiration to the total soil respiration was 31.0%–45.9% for the three different-aged forests. The present study found that the total soil respiration was not significantly affected by forest age when P. masonniana stands exceed a certain age (e.g. >20 years old), but it increased significantly with increased soil temperature. Hence, forest management strategies need to protect the understory vegetation to limit soil warming, in order to reduce the CO2 emission under the currently rapid global warming. The contribution of litter decomposition to the total soil respiration varies across spatial and temporal scales. This indicates the need for separate consideration of soil and litter respiration when assessing the climate impacts on forest carbon cycling."
https://openalex.org/W2164876260,In this paper we extend previous work deriving dynamic equations governing infectious disease spread on networks. The previous work has implicitly assumed that the disease is initialized by an infinitesimally small proportion of the population. Our modifications allow us to account for an arbitrarily large initial proportion infected. This helps resolve an apparent paradox in earlier work whereby the number of susceptible individuals could increase if too many individuals were initially infected. It also helps explain an apparent small deviation that has been observed between simulation and theory. An advantage of this modification is that it allows us to account for changes in the structure or behavior of the population during the epidemic.

Here we demonstrate for the first time that specific luminal calcium depletion leads to a significant decrease in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi transport rates in intact cells. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that luminal calcium depletion is accompanied by increased accumulation of intermediate compartment proteins in COPII buds and clusters of unfused COPII vesicles at ER exit sites. Furthermore, we present several lines of evidence suggesting that luminal calcium affected transport at least in part through calcium-dependent interactions between apoptosis-linked gene-2 (ALG-2) and the Sec31A proline-rich region: 1) targeted disruption of ALG-2/Sec31A interactions caused severe defects in ER-to-Golgi transport in intact cells; 2) effects of luminal calcium and ALG-2/Sec31A interactions on transport mutually required each other; and 3) Sec31A function in transport required luminal calcium. Morphological phenotypes of disrupted ALG-2/Sec31A interactions were characterized. We found that ALG-2/Sec31A interactions were not required for the localization of Sec31A to ER exit sites per se but appeared to acutely regulate the stability and trafficking of the cargo receptor p24 and the distribution of the vesicle tether protein p115.

This correlates with maternal size and affects intra-uterine development and subsequent post-natal growth, as well as insulin sensitivity in the newborn. Long-term effects remain to be described. In this study, fetal growth was enhanced or restricted through ET using pony (P), saddlebred (S) and draft (D) horses. Control P-P (n = 21) and S-S (n = 28) pregnancies were obtained by AI. Enhanced and restricted pregnancies were obtained by transferring P or S embryos into D mares (P-D, n = 6 and S-D, n = 8) or S embryos into P mares (S-P, n = 6), respectively. Control and experimental foals were raised by their dams and recipient mothers, respectively. Weight gain, growth hormones and glucose homeostasis were investigated in the foals from birth to weaning. Fetal growth was enhanced in P-D and these foals remained consistently heavier, with reduced T3 concentrations until weaning compared to P-P. P-D had lower fasting glucose from days 30 to 200 and higher insulin secretion than P-P after IVGTT on day 3. Euglycemic clamps in the immediate post-weaning period revealed no difference in insulin sensitivity between P-D and P-P. Fetal growth was restricted in S-P and these foals remained consistently lighter until weaning compared to S-D, with elevated T3 concentrations in the newborn compared to S-S. S-P exhibited higher fasting glycemia than S-S and S-D from days 30 to 200. They had higher maximum increment in plasma glucose than S-D after IVGTT on day 3 and clamps on day 200 demonstrated higher insulin sensitivity compared to S-D. Neither the restricted nor the enhanced fetal environment affected IGF-1 concentrations. Thus, enhanced and restricted fetal and post-natal environments had combined effects that persisted until weaning. They induced different adaptive responses in post-natal glucose metabolism: an early insulin-resistance was induced in enhanced P-D, while S-P developed increased insulin sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2078143617,"Protein kinases are regulated by a large number of mechanisms that vary from one kinase to another. However, a fundamental activation mechanism shared by all protein kinases is phosphorylation of a conserved activation loop threonine residue. This is achieved in many cases via autophosphorylation. The mechanism and structural basis for autophosphorylation are not clear and are in fact enigmatic because this phosphorylation occurs when the kinase is in its inactive conformation. Unlike most protein kinases, MAP kinases are not commonly activated by autophosphorylation but rather by MEK-dependent phosphorylation. Here we show that p38β, a p38 isoform that is almost identical to p38α, is exceptional and spontaneously autoactivates by autophosphorylation. We identified a 13-residue-long region composed of part of the αG-helix and the MAPK insert that triggers the intrinsic autophosphorylation activity of p38β. When inserted into p38α, this fragment renders it spontaneously active in vitro and in mammalian cells. We further found that an interaction between the N terminus and a particular region of the C-terminal extension suppresses the intrinsic autophosphorylation of p38β in mammalian cells. Thus, this study identified the structural motif responsible for the unique autophosphorylation capability of p38β and the motif inhibiting this activity in living cells. It shows that the MAPK insert and C-terminal extension, structural motifs that are unique to MAPKs, play a critical role in controlling autophosphorylation."

However, the molecular details of their interactions are poorly understood. We have studied the interaction between ASC and pyrin PYDs that mediates ASC recruitment to the pyrin inflammasome, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of familial Mediterranean fever.

https://openalex.org/W1985870840,"Background Surveys of doctors suggest that they use placebos and placebo effects clinically to help patients. However, patients' views are not well-understood. We aimed to identify when and why placebo-prescribing in primary care might be acceptable and unacceptable to patients. Methods A purposive diverse sample of 58 English-speaking adults (18 men; aged 19–80 years) participated in 11 focus groups. Vignettes describing doctors prescribing placebos in primary care were used to initiate discussions. Data were analyzed inductively. Results Participants discussed diverse harms and benefits of placebo-prescribing for individual patients, carers, healthcare providers, and society. Two perspectives on placebo-prescribing were identified. First, the “consequentialist” perspective focused on the potential for beneficial outcomes of placebo-prescribing. Here, some participants thought placebos are beneficial and should be used clinically; they often invoked the power of the mind or mind-body interactions. Others saw placebos as ineffective and therefore a waste of time and money. Second, the “respecting autonomy” perspective emphasized the harms caused by the deceptive processes thought necessary for placebo-prescribing. Here, participants judged placebo-prescribing unacceptable because placebo-prescribers deceive patients, thus a doctor who prescribes placebos cannot be trusted and patients' autonomy is compromised. They also saw placebo-responders as gullible, which deterred them from trying placebos themselves. Overall, the word “placebo” was often thought to imply “ineffective”; some participants suggested alternative carefully chosen language that could enable doctors to prescribe placebos without directly lying to patients. Conclusions Negative views of placebos derive from beliefs that placebos do not work and/or that they require deception by the doctor. Positive views are pragmatic in that if placebos work then any associated processes (e.g. mechanisms, deception) are deemed unimportant. Public education about placebos and their effects is warranted and research to identify optimal ways of harnessing placebo effects in clinical practice is needed."

In 2009, in order to assess outcomes and evaluate risk factors for progression of illness, two cohort studies were initiated: FLU 002 in outpatients and FLU 003 in hospitalized patients.Between October 2009 and December 2012, adults with influenza-like illness (ILI) were enrolled; outpatients were followed for 14 days and inpatients for 60 days. Disease progression was defined as hospitalization and/or death for outpatients, and hospitalization for >28 days, transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) if enrolled from general ward, and/or death for inpatients. Infection was confirmed by RT-PCR. 590 FLU 002 and 392 FLU 003 patients with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 were enrolled from 81 sites in 17 countries at 2 days (IQR 1-3) and 6 days (IQR 4-10) following ILI onset, respectively. Disease progression was experienced by 29 (1 death) outpatients (5.1%; 95% CI: 3.4-7.2%) and 80 inpatients [death (32), hospitalization >28 days (43) or ICU transfer (20)] (21.6%; 95% CI: 17.5-26.2%). Disease progression (death) for hospitalized patients was 53.1% (26.6%) and 12.8% (3.8%), respectively, for those enrolled in the ICU and general ward. In pooled analyses for both studies, predictors of disease progression were age, longer duration of symptoms at enrollment and immunosuppression. Patients hospitalized during the pandemic period had a poorer prognosis than in subsequent seasons.Patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, particularly when requiring hospital admission, are at high risk for disease progression, especially if they are older, immunodeficient, or admitted late in infection. These data reinforce the need for international trials of novel treatment strategies for influenza infection and serve as a reminder of the need to monitor the severity of seasonal and pandemic influenza epidemics globally.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: FLU 002--NCT01056354, FLU 003--NCT01056185."
https://openalex.org/W2002508526,"Background and objectives Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) represent a promising cell-based therapy for a number of inflammatory or autoimmune diseases. Herein, Toll like receptor (TLR) expression by MSCs and their immune regulatory roles are investigated. In this study, we investigated the influence of TLR on the immune response, proliferation, and differentiation potential of human turbinated MSC (hTMSC) cultures in vitro. Subjects and Methods After isolating hTMSCs from discarded inferior turbinate tissue, FACS analysis was used to assess the expression of TLRs such as TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR5 in hTMSCs and cell proliferation was assessed using a cell counting kit (CCK)-8. Cytokine and chemokine secretions were analyzed with multiplex immunoassays for IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IP-10 (CXCL10), RANTES (CCL5), TNF-a, GM-CSF, and IFN-γ. The differentiation potential of hTMSCs was evaluated in the osteogenic, chondogenic, and adipogeinc media and analyzed by histology and gene expression related to differentiation. Results FACS analysis revealed that TLR3 and TLR4 expression consisted of a relatively high percentage of the surface proteins expressed by hTMSCs. The proliferation of hTMSCs was influenced and significantly increased by the presence of TLR4 agonists. In particular, hTMSCs produced a set of cytokines and chemokines and the expression of IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IP-10 (CXCL10), RANTES (CCL5), TNF-α, and GM-CSF were up-regulated in response to the TLR4 agonist LPS. The osteogenic and adipogeinc differentiation potential of hTMSCs was not affected by TLR agonists. Conclusions We conclude that TLR4 stimulation affects TLR expression, proliferation, and the immunomodulation potential of hTMSCs. Understanding the mechanism behind TLR's influence on hTMSCs and their immunomodulating properties would be useful for providing a novel target to exploit in the improvement of stem cell-based therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2077226657,"We examined the magnesium dependence of five class II myosins, including fast skeletal muscle myosin, smooth muscle myosin, β-cardiac myosin (CMIIB), Dictyostelium myosin II (DdMII), and nonmuscle myosin IIA, as well as myosin V. We found that the myosins examined are inhibited in a Mg2+-dependent manner (0.3–9.0 mm free Mg2+) in both ATPase and motility assays, under conditions in which the ionic strength was held constant. We found that the ADP release rate constant is reduced by Mg2+ in myosin V, smooth muscle myosin, nonmuscle myosin IIA, CMIIB, and DdMII, although the ADP affinity is fairly insensitive to Mg2+ in fast skeletal muscle myosin, CMIIB, and DdMII. Single tryptophan probes in the switch I (Trp-239) and switch II (Trp-501) region of DdMII demonstrate these conserved regions of the active site are sensitive to Mg2+ coordination. Cardiac muscle fiber mechanic studies demonstrate cross-bridge attachment time is increased at higher Mg2+ concentrations, demonstrating that the ADP release rate constant is slowed by Mg2+ in the context of an activated muscle fiber. Direct measurements of phosphate release in myosin V demonstrate that Mg2+ reduces actin affinity in the M·ADP·Pi state, although it does not change the rate of phosphate release. Therefore, the Mg2+ inhibition of the actin-activated ATPase activity observed in class II myosins is likely the result of Mg2+-dependent alterations in actin binding. Overall, our results suggest that Mg2+ reduces the ADP release rate constant and rate of attachment to actin in both high and low duty ratio myosins.

Magnesium is an abundant divalent cation known for its role as an essential metal cofactor for many enzymes that utilize nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) as an intracellular energy source. Previous studies with motor proteins such as myosin traditionally focus on the role of Mg2+ as a cofactor in ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release in the force-generating mechanochemical cycle (1.Bagshaw C.R.

Recent studies highlight the possibility that free Mg2+ can modulate motor activity and thus physiological function in muscle myosin II and unconventional myosins I, V, and VII (3.Kintses B.

These studies generally support a mechanism whereby Mg2+ alters key steps in the mechanochemical cycle, including the ADP release rate constant, which is an important determinant of duty ratio (fraction of the ATPase cycle myosin remains attached to actin). However, it remains unclear to what degree other steps of the actomyosin ATPase cycle are impacted by Mg2+. In addition, it is unclear if Mg2+-dependent modulation of myosin motor activity is conserved throughout the myosin superfamily. Several NTPase superfamilies, including myosins, kinesins, and G proteins, share highly conserved elements in their nucleotide binding regions (8.Vale R.D. Switches, latches, and amplifiers: common themes of G proteins and molecular motors.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The P-loop, switch I, and switch II are involved in NTP binding, hydrolysis, and Mg2+ coordination. In myosins, these conserved elements have the ability to amplify small changes in the nucleotide binding region to large scale force-generating movements of the light chain binding region or lever arm. Our previous work has focused on the impact of Mg2+ on myosin V (MV), 2The abbreviations used are: MVmyosin VSKIIfast skeletal muscle myosinSMIIsmooth muscle myosinCMIIBβ-cardiac myosinDdMIIDictyostelium myosin IINMIIAnonmuscle myosin IIAmant-dADPN-methylanthraniloyl (mant)-labeled 2′-deoxy-ADP. a ubiquitous intracellular transporter that has been well characterized both structurally and biochemically (9.Trivedi D.V.

Myosin binding to actin in the post-hydrolysis ADP·Pi state (K9) results in acceleration of phosphate release (k′+4) and formation of the actomyosin·ADP state with a high affinity for ADP (Scheme 1). An active site isomerization results in a weakening of the affinity for ADP (k′+5A) and promotes the release of nucleotide (k′+5B). In the presence of actin, Mg2+ is thought to exchange readily from both actomyosin·ADP states and can alter both the transition between actomyosin·ADP states and the release of ADP (5.Hannemann D.E.

Because the ADP release step is rate-limiting in myosin V, increasing free Mg2+ concentration slows the myosin V ATPase activity as well as sliding velocity (9.Trivedi D.V. Muretta J.M. Swenson A.M.

The detachment-limited model (14.Huxley H.E. Sliding filaments and molecular motile systems.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that sliding velocity (V) is inversely proportional to the attached time (ton), the period of time myosin is strongly attached to actin, and is proportional to the size of the unitary displacement (duni), the displacement generated by a single myosin motor (Equation 1). V=duni/ton(Eq. 1) Therefore, the Mg2+ dependence of in vitro sliding velocity should correlate with the Mg2+ dependence of the ADP release rate constant in myosins that follow a detachment-limited model. myosin V fast skeletal muscle myosin smooth muscle myosin β-cardiac myosin Dictyostelium myosin II nonmuscle myosin IIA N-methylanthraniloyl (mant)-labeled 2′-deoxy-ADP. Recent studies in other unconventional myosins support a conserved mechanism for Mg2+ inhibition of the ADP release steps. In addition, these studies suggest that Mg2+ can facilitate the transition between a motor that is a transporter or a tension generator (7.Heissler S.M. Manstein D.J. Functional characterization of the human myosin-7a motor domain.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2012; 69: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For example, regulation of myosin I occurs at Mg2+ concentrations between 0.3 and 1 mm free Mg2+, which is within the concentration range measured intracellularly (4.Fujita-Becker S. Dürrwang U. Erent M. Clark R.J. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. Changes in Mg2+ ion concentration and heavy chain phosphorylation regulate the motor activity of a class I myosin.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6064-6071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A study on myosin VII, a mechanoenzyme involved in auditory and visual processes, reveals a similar sub-millimolar Mg2+ sensitivity with total inhibition of sliding velocity above 1 mm free Mg2+ (7.Heissler S.M. Manstein D.J. Functional characterization of the human myosin-7a motor domain.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2012; 69: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although intracellular Mg2+ concentrations are traditionally thought to be maintained within a narrow range, recent studies are challenging this view with the report of large Mg2+ gradients in the cell (15.Romani A.M. Cellular magnesium homeostasis.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2011; 512: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In muscle, the free Mg2+ concentration ranges from 0.7 mm in cardiac muscle (16.Buri A. Chen S. Fry C.H. Illner H. Kickenweiz E. McGuigan J.A. Noble D. Powell T. Twist V.W.

Galler S. Intracellular free Mg2+ concentration in skeletal muscle fibres of frog and crayfish.Pflugers Arch. 1991; 417: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, alterations in free Mg2+ concentrations have been associated with cardiovascular disease (19.Sanders G.T. Huijgen H.J. Sanders R. Magnesium in disease: a review with special emphasis on the serum ionized magnesium.Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 1999; 37: 1011-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and contractile performance (20.Irving M. Maylie J. Sizto N.L. Chandler W.K.

Physiol. 1989; 93: 585-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings highlight the importance of investigating the conserved mechanisms of Mg2+-dependent modulation of myosin motor activity. Structural and biochemical studies of Dictyostelium myosin II have contributed significantly to an enhanced understanding of the mechanochemical cycle of class II myosins (21.Zeng W. Conibear P.B. Dickens J.L. Cowie R.A. Wakelin S. Málnási-Csizmadia A. Bagshaw C.R. Dynamics of actomyosin interactions in relation to the cross-bridge cycle.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2004; 359: 1843-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A study on Dictyostelium myosin II is in general agreement with myosin V studies regarding the presence of two actomyosin ADP states (3.Kintses B. Gyimesi M. Pearson D.S. Geeves M.A. Zeng W. Bagshaw C.R. Málnási-Csizmadia A. Reversible movement of switch 1 loop of myosin determines actin interaction.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, this work proposed that Mg2+ exchanges from the weak actomyosin·ADP state exclusively, which could potentially be the result of class-specific variations in Mg2+ coordination. One residue in the switch II region of myosin V (Tyr-439 in myosin V, which corresponds to Ser-456 in Dictyostelium) was studied by Nagy et al. (22.Nagy N.T. Sakamoto T. Takács B. Gyimesi M. Hazai E. Bikádi Z. Sellers J.R. Kovács M. Functional adaptation of the switch-2 nucleotide sensor enables rapid processive translocation by myosin-5.FASEB J. 2010; 24: 4480-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and proposed to be an important mediator of Mg2+ binding affinity. Variability at this conserved residue may be one contributing factor for the increased sensitivity to Mg2+ observed in some unconventional myosins. In this study, we directly compare the impact of Mg2+ on a subset of muscle and nonmuscle myosins. We find the major impact of Mg2+ manifests itself differently based on characteristic rate-limiting step differences in myosins. Our results support a model in which increasing Mg2+ concentration universally slows actomyosin ATPase activity, in vitro actin sliding, and contractile velocity in muscle in a manner independent of ionic strength. We demonstrate that multiple steps in the actomyosin ATPase cycle are sensitive to changes in physiological free Mg2+ concentrations. All reagents were of the highest quality and purity commercially obtainable. ATP and ADP were prepared fresh from powder, and the concentrations were measured by absorbance at 259 nm with ϵ259 = 15,400 m−1−cm−1 (23.De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M.

Myosin concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm (MV 1IQ, ϵ280 = 103,600 m−1·cm−1, SKII, ϵ280 = 210,000 m−1·cm−1) or by Bio-Rad microplate assay using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle using the acetone powder method (32.Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Purification of muscle actin.Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Pyrene-labeled actin was prepared with N-(1-pyrene)iodoacetamide (Invitrogen) as described (33.Pollard T.D. Polymerization of ADP-actin.J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). MV experiments were performed in KMg50 buffer (10 mm imidazole, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.0, 25 °C). Myosin II experiments were carried out in a lower ionic strength MOPS buffer (10 or 20 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.0, 25 °C). A constant ionic strength of 0.05 m for myosin II (except actin-activated ATPase experiments, Fig. 1, in which 0.04 m was used) and 0.08 m for myosin V was maintained throughout all assays by varying KCl concentrations to balance changes in MgCl2 concentration. The buffer used for DdMII experiments was 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, whereas MgCl2 concentrations were varied, and ionic strength was compensated by changing NaCl concentrations (i.e. 120 mm NaCl, 0 mm MgCl2 or 60 mm NaCl2, 20 mm MgCl2). Free Mg2+ concentrations were calculated using MaxC 2.5. Most transient kinetic experiments were performed at 25 °C in an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow spectrophotometer with a dead time of 1.2 ms. A monochromator with a 2-nm bandpass was used for fluorescence excitation, and a 395-nm cutoff filter was used to measure fluorescence emission. The mant-labeled nucleotides were excited by FRET from endogenous tryptophan residues (290 nm); pyrene actin was excited at 365 nm, and phosphate-binding protein was excited at 380 nm. Nonlinear least squares fitting of the data were conducted on software provided with the instrument or KaleidaGraph. The DdMII studies were performed in a Biokine (Biologic) stopped-flow apparatus, and tryptophan fluorescence was observed with an excitation wavelength of 297 nm, and emission was measured with a 340-nm interference filter. The DdMII stopped-flow experiment was performed at 13 °C to maximize the tryptophan fluorescence signal. Reported uncertainties correspond to standard errors of the fits unless noted otherwise. Kinetic results were interpreted in terms of Schemes 1 and 2 with a description of the methods used to fit each specific experiment given under “Results” and figure legends.

Absorbance changes were detected at 340 nm, and the extinction coefficient for NADH (ϵ340 = 6,220 m−1·cm−1) was used to determine the oxidation rate of NADH. Steady state ATPase rates were obtained at a set of MgCl2 concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 10 mm (0.3 to 9 mm free Mg2+, respectively) in the presence of 20 μm (MV) or 60 μm (SKII, SMII, NMIIA, and CMIIB) actin and saturating 1 mm ATP. Assays were also performed with a range of actin concentrations to determine maximum ATPase rate (kcat) and the actin concentration at which ATPase is half-maximal (KATPase). The actin filament sliding assay was performed as described previously (36.Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Assays for actin sliding movement over myosin-coated surfaces.Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) at a range of Mg2+ concentrations in conditions (controlled ionic strength) similar to the corresponding ATPase assay for each myosin. Myosin was adhered to a 1% nitrocellulose in an amyl acetate (Ladd Research)-coated coverslip directly or with a c-Myc antibody (Sigma) in the case of SMII and NMIIA. The surface was blocked with BSA at 1 mg·ml−1 before the addition of actin labeled with either rhodamine phalloidin (TRITC filter cube; excitation/emission, 545/620 nm) or Alexa (FITC filter cube; excitation/emission, 500/535 nm). An activation buffer with varying MgCl2 concentrations (0.5–10 mm) was added containing MOPS or KMg50 with 5 μm calmodulin (MV only) and supplemented with the corresponding amount of KCl to maintain ionic strength and the following: 0.35% methylcellulose, 2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 20 units·ml−1 pyruvate kinase, 0.1 mg·ml−1 glucose oxidase, 5 mg·ml−1 glucose, 0.018 mg·ml−1 catalase, and 1 mm ATP. The slide was promptly viewed using a NIKON TE2000 microscope equipped with a 60×/1.4 NA phase objective and a Perfect Focus System. Images were acquired at intervals (0.2–5 s) and for periods of time (1–5 min) appropriate for each myosin using a shutter-controlled Coolsnap HQ2-cooled CCD digital camera (Photometrics) binned 2 × 2. Temperature was maintained at 26 ± 1 °C and monitored using a thermocouple meter (Stable Systems International). Image stacks were transferred to ImageJ for analysis via MTrackJ (37.Meijering E. Dzyubachyk O. Smal I. Methods for cell and particle tracking.Methods Enzymol. 2012; 504: 183-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Frequency of filament breakage was determined for MV, NMIIA, and SKII at 0.3 and 9.0 mm free Mg2+ by recording elapsed time to initial filament breakage for ≥50 filaments per condition (38.Stewart T.J. Jackson Jr., D.R. Smith R.D. Shannon S.F. Cremo C.R. Baker J.E. Actin sliding velocities are influenced by the driving forces of actin-myosin binding.Cell. Mol.

All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of Vermont College of Medicine. Cardiac papillary muscle was taken from one male conventional swine (E. M. Parsons) weighing 16 kg.

Free Mg2+ concentrations of 1, 2, 4, and 8 mm were applied at pCa 4.8 by exchanging volumes of 1 or 8 mm free Mg2+ solutions. Chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma, and concentrations were expressed in mmol·liter−1 unless noted otherwise. Concentrations were calculated using an ionic equilibrium program (40.Godt R.E. Lindley B.D.

https://openalex.org/W2070423082,"Micellisation process for sodium dodecyl sulphate and sodium cholate in 1∶1 molar ratio was investigated in a combined approach, including several experimental methods and coarse grained molecular dynamics simulation. The critical micelle concentration (cmc) of mixed micelle was determined by spectrofluorimetric and surface tension measurements in the temperature range of 0-50°C and the values obtained agreed with each other within the statistical error of the measurements. In range of 0-25°C the cmc values obtained are temperature independent while cmc values were increased at higher temperature, which can be explained by the intensive motion of the monomers due to increased temperature. The evidence of existing synergistic effect among different constituent units of the micelle is indicated clearly by the interaction parameter (β1,2) calculated from cmc values according to Rubingh. As the results of the conductivity measurements showed the negative surface charges of the SDS-NaCA micelle are not neutralized by counterions. Applying a 10 µs long coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation for system including 30-30 SDS and CA (with appropriate number of Na+ cations and water molecules) we obtained semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental results. Spontaneous aggregation of the surfactant molecules was obtained and the key steps of the micelle formation are identified: First a stable SDS core was formed and thereafter due to the entering CA molecules the size of the micelle increased and the SDS content decreased. In addition the size distribution and composition as well as the shape and structure of micelles are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2010892446,"Background High prevalence of mental disorders among foster children highlight the need to examine the mental health of children placed out of home. We examined the properties of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in screening school-aged foster children for mental disorders. Methods Foster parents and teachers of 279 foster children completed the SDQ and the diagnostic interview Developmental and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA). Using the diagnoses derived from the DAWBA as the standard, we examined the performance of the SDQ scales as dimensional measures of mental health problems using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Recommended cut-off scores were derived from ROC coordinates. The SDQ predictive algorithms were also examined. Results ROC analyses supported the screening properties of the SDQ Total difficulties and Impact scores (AUC = 0.80–0.83). Logistic regression analyses showed that the prevalence of mental disorders increased linearly with higher SDQ Total difficulties scores (X2 = 121.47, df = 13, p<.001) and Impact scores (X2 = 69.93, df = 6, p<.001). Our results indicated that there is an additive value of combining the scores from the Total difficulties and Impact scales, where scores above cut-off on any of the two scales predicted disorders with high sensitivity (89.1%), but moderate specificity (62.1%). Scores above cut-off on both scales yielded somewhat lower sensitivity (73.4%), but higher specificity (81.1%). The SDQ multi-informant algorithm showed low discriminative ability for the main diagnostic categories, with an exception being the SDQ Conduct subscale, which accurately predicted the absence of behavioural disorders (LHR− = 0.00). Conclusions The results support the use of the SDQ Total difficulties and Impact scales when screening foster children for mental health problems. Cut-off values for both scales are suggested. The SDQ multi-informant algorithms are not recommended for mental health screening of foster children in Norway."
https://openalex.org/W2000918704,"The variability of the heart rate (HRV) is widely studied as it contains information about the activity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). However, HRV is influenced by breathing, independently of ANS activity. It is therefore important to include respiratory information in HRV analyses in order to correctly interpret the results. In this paper, we propose to record respiratory activity and use this information to separate the tachogram in two components: one which is related to breathing and one which contains all heart rate variations that are unrelated to respiration. Several algorithms to achieve this have been suggested in the literature, but no comparison between the methods has been performed yet. In this paper, we conduct two studies to evaluate the methods' performances to accurately decompose the tachogram in two components and to assess the robustness of the algorithms. The results show that orthogonal subspace projection and an ARMAX model yield the best performances over the two comparison studies. In addition, a real-life example of stress classification is presented to demonstrate that this approach to separate respiratory information in HRV studies can reveal changes in the heart rate variations that are otherwise masked by differing respiratory patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2003352260,"Concept associations can be represented by a network that consists of a set of nodes representing concepts and a set of edges representing their relationships. Complex networks exhibit some common topological features including small diameter, high degree of clustering, power-law degree distribution, and modularity. We investigated the topological properties of a network constructed from co-occurrences between MeSH descriptors in the MEDLINE database. We conducted the analysis on two networks, one constructed from all MeSH descriptors and another using only major descriptors. Network reduction was performed using the Pearson's chi-square test for independence. To characterize topological properties of the network we adopted some specific measures, including diameter, average path length, clustering coefficient, and degree distribution. For the full MeSH network the average path length was 1.95 with a diameter of three edges and clustering coefficient of 0.26. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test rejects the power law as a plausible model for degree distribution. For the major MeSH network the average path length was 2.63 edges with a diameter of seven edges and clustering coefficient of 0.15. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test failed to reject the power law as a plausible model. The power-law exponent was 5.07. In both networks it was evident that nodes with a lower degree exhibit higher clustering than those with a higher degree. After simulated attack, where we removed 10% of nodes with the highest degrees, the giant component of each of the two networks contains about 90% of all nodes. Because of small average path length and high degree of clustering the MeSH network is small-world. A power-law distribution is not a plausible model for the degree distribution. The network is highly modular, highly resistant to targeted and random attack and with minimal dissortativity."
https://openalex.org/W2052332480,"Drug resistance and cancer metastasis are two major problems in cancer research. During a course of therapeutic treatment in Brca1-associated tumors, we found that breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) exhibit an intrinsic ability to metastasize and acquire drug resistance through distinct signaling pathways. Microarray analysis indicated that the cytoskeletal remodeling pathway was differentially regulated in CSCs, and this was further evidenced by the inhibitory role of reagents that impair this pathway in the motility of cancer cells. We showed that cisplatin treatment, although initially inhibiting cancer growth, preventing metastasis through blocking cytoskeletal remodeling, and retarding CSC motility, eventually led to drug resistance associated with a marked increase in the number of CSCs. This event was at least partially attributed to the activation of PI3K signaling, and it could be significantly inhibited by co-treatment with rapamycin. These results provide strong evidence that cytoskeletal rearrangement and PI3K/AKT signaling play distinct roles in mediating CSC mobility and viability, respectively, and blocking both pathways synergistically may inhibit primary and metastatic cancer growth.

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women as revealed by the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program, NCI, National Institutes of Health, which reports that 1 in 8 women born in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer at some time in their lives. Despite the progress in prevention, detection, and adjuvant therapy of breast cancer, metastasis remains the main cause of death, and metastatic breast cancer is typically incurable (1.Jemal A. Siegel R. Xu J. Ward E. Cancer statistics, 2010.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2010; 60: 277-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (12356) Google Scholar). Metastasis is a multistep process composed of invasion through the basement membrane barrier and extracellular matrix (ECM), 4The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixCSCcancer stem cellmTORmammalian target of rapamycinERMezrin, radixin, and moesinS6RPS6 ribosomal proteinBMIBio-Macrolide I. entry of tumor cells into the circulation (intravasation), survival within the vasculature, extravasation into distant tissues, and finally the establishment and growth of secondary tumors (2.Fidler I.J.

MacDonald I.C. Dissemination and growth of cancer cells in metastatic sites.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (3055) Google Scholar). These processes rely on the coordinated spatial-temporal expression of various genes and commensurate protein products, which allows tumor cells to successfully metastasize to distant tissues.

Triple-negative breast cancers (negative for estrogen, progesterone receptors, and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)) account for about 15–20% of all breast cancers and represent a heterogeneous group of invasive breast cancers with a relatively poorer prognosis than the major breast cancer subtypes (4.Boyle P. Triple-negative breast cancer: epidemiological considerations and recommendations.Ann. Oncol. 2012; 23 (2012 Aug; 23): vi7-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The majority of familial breast cancers associated with mutations in breast cancer-associated gene 1 (BRCA1) belong to this category (5.Anders C. Carey L.A. Understanding and treating triple-negative breast cancer.Oncology. 2008; 22: 1233-1239PubMed Google Scholar). Hereditary breast cancers account for 5–10% of all breast cancers, and of these, BRCA1 mutations are found in half of these cases. In contrast to estrogen-positive or HER2-positive breast tumors, currently there is no targeted therapy for triple-negative breast cancer. Thus, conditional Brca1 mouse models that develop mammary tumors with a strong resemblance to human BRCA1-mutated breast tumors can be very helpful in predicting response and allowing for the discovery of new therapeutic strategies for this highly aggressive subcategory of breast tumors (6.Dine J. Deng C.X. Mouse models of BRCA1 and their application to breast cancer research.Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2013; 32: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The failure to target the subpopulation of cells with the highest migration ability contributes to the ineffectiveness of current treatments for metastatic tumors. Growing evidence indicates that certain types of cancer are stem cell diseases (7.Al-Hajj M. Wicha M.S. Benito-Hernandez A. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F.

Pollett A. Gallinger S. Dick J.E. A human colon cancer cell capable of initiating tumour growth in immunodeficient mice.Nature. 2007; 445: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). The cancer stem cell theory predicts that not all cancer cells within a tumor exhibit the same tumor-growing ability, and it is only a rare population of cells with stem cell properties that drives tumor growth. This concept may have implications in the metastatic process as well, suggesting that not all cells possess the same metastatic potential, and cancer stem cells (CSCs) may share characteristics necessary to induce both tumorigenesis and metastasis. The first evidence of a cancer stem cell origin for breast cancer was reported in 2003 (7.Al-Hajj M. Wicha M.S. Benito-Hernandez A. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Prospective identification of tumorigenic breast cancer cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 3983-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (8403) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this study CSCs were initially derived mainly from metastases implying that both tumor growth and metastasis originate from CSCs. Furthermore, data from more recent studies also showed that CSCs from breast tumors possess an “invasiveness” gene signature associated with the active epithelial-mesenchymal transition program and exhibit higher metastatic potential than non-CSCs (10.Liu H.

During a course of therapeutic treatment in Brca1 mutant mammary tumors, we found that cisplatin is the most effective among the tested drugs in terms of slowing down tumor growth. However, our data also revealed that tumors gradually developed drug resistance accompanied by an increase in the population of CSCs and an unexpected decrease in primary tumor metastasis. We further demonstrated that this decrease is primarily due to the inhibitory role of cisplatin in cytoskeletal remodeling-mediated migration of CSCs, whereas treatment with both cisplatin and rapamycin effectively blocked cancer cell survival and metastasis. Mice carrying Cre-LoxP-mediated mammary-specific deletion of the full-length form of Brca1 and a heterozygous null mutation of p53 (Brca1Co/Co;p53±;MMTV-Cre) were generated as described earlier (15.Xu X.

The protocol for animal studies was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the NIDDK. Cells after trypsinization or single cells from primary tumors were resuspended in PBS, which then were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) on ice. For drug treatment experiments, 1 × 106 cells from primary mammary tumors were implanted into the fourth mammary fat pad of female immunocompromised mice. When the tumors became palpable, the recipient mice were treated with the following: ICI182,780 (Tocris, 5 mg/mouse was injected subcutaneously, once a week); U1026 (Cell Signaling Technology, 10 mg/kg, i.p. injection, every other day); mifepristone (RU-486) (made into a pellet, 35 mg/pellet, 60-day release, and 1 pellet was implanted underneath the skin at the back neck); rapamycin (Chempacific, 4 mg/kg, i.p. injection, every other day), or cisplatin (Sigma, 6 mg/kg, i.p. injection, twice a week). Tumor volumes were monitored daily during the first 60 days and then every other day. Tumor size was measured with a caliper when visible nodules were present. Tumor volume was calculated in mm3 by using Equation 1, V=1/2rxry2(Eq. 1) where r is radius and x and y refer to each axis. For checking metastasis in vivo, at the end of the experiment animals were sacrificed, and multiple tissues were removed and examined for the presence of metastatic tumors with a Leica MZ10F stereomicroscope. Cells were grown to confluence either in 35-mm wells or 4-well chamber slides. Wounds were generated by scratching using a 200-μl pipette tip, and cells were washed three times with PBS followed by addition of fresh medium. After 24 h, new pictures were taken, and migration was analyzed by checking the maximum distance of the cell front into the wounded area. For experiments where different compounds were tested, wounds were scratched, and cells were allowed to migrate in the presence of the medium supplemented with the tested compound. Triplicate wells were used per condition. For transwell assays, cells were starved for 24 h and, after trypsinization, were plated in the top chambers of 8-μm pore transwells (BD Biosciences) in serum-free medium in 6-well plates (1.5 × 105 cells/well). Cells were allowed to migrate toward regular medium (DMEM, 10% FBS) over a period of 24 h. At the end of the assay, cells at the top chamber were removed, and the cells at the bottom of the filter were fixed with 100% methanol for 20 min and stained with hematoxylin solution for 10 min. Then membranes were removed, placed in slides, coverslipped, and examined immediately using a Leica DMR microscope. Alternatively, after cell migration for 24 h, transwells were removed, and cells that migrated to the lower chamber were allowed to attach and form colonies. After 5–6 days, colonies were fixed with 100% methanol for 20 min and stained with hematoxylin solution for 10 min. Plates were checked for the presence of colonies with a Leica MZ10F stereomicroscope, and pictures were captured using an Olympus camera. When GFP-labeled cells were used for the migration assays, the presence of migrating cells was checked under a Leica DMR microscope. For real time monitoring of cellular migration, the xCELLigence Real Time Cell Analyzer (RTCA) DP instrument was used (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell migration was dynamically recorded and analyzed by using the RCTA software 1.2. Triplicate wells were used per condition in all experiments. For histology, tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, blocked in paraffin, sectioned, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined by light microscopy (Leica DMR microscope). For immunohistochemistry, a histostain staining kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Western blotting, membranes were blocked with either 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS or 5% BSA in TBST and then incubated with primary antibodies against phosphorylated ERM, ERM, p-AKT(Ser-473), pan-AKT, p-S6RP(Ser-235/236), S6RP, p-4EBP1(T70), 4EBP1 (Cell Signaling), laminin, collagen IV (Abcam), β-actin, and α-tubulin (Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare) were used, and protein was visualized using enhanced Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore). Specifically for detection of phosphorylated and total levels of ERM, cells were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, 2% SDS (v/v)) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Pierce). For fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, cells were stained at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells per 100 μl of buffer (PBS, pH 7.2, 0.5% BSA, 2 mm EDTA) with antibodies against CD24 (anti CD24-PE, Pharmingen), CD29 (anti CD29-FITC, Chemicon), CD49f (anti-CD49f-FITC, Pharmingen), and CD44 (anti CD44-APC, Pharmingen). After incubation at 4 °C for 25 min, analysis was done using the FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For sorting out different cell populations, the same procedure was followed, and sorting was carried out using a FACS Aria Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences). Total RNA was isolated from cells with STAT-60 following the manufacturer's protocol (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). Complementary DNA was synthesized with Cells-to-cDNAII (Ambion, Austin, TX). For real time PCR, SYBR® Green PCR master mix was used (Applied Biosystems), and data were acquired with a 7500 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Total RNA was isolated from the sorted subpopulations based upon CD24 and CD29 expression using the mirVanaTM miRNA isolation kit (Ambion), followed by mRNA amplification using a T7 global amplification method (two-cycle target labeling kit; Affymetrix), DNA fragmentation, biotinylation, and hybridization onto Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 array chips. The microarray signals were referred by the Affymetrix Robust Multichip Average algorithm. Up- and down-regulated genes were selected based on p values (<0.05) and fold changes (> 2 or < −2) assessed by analysis of variance with pro software from Partek. The microarray analysis was performed with three independent biological sample sets. The microarray data have been submitted to the GEO database under the accession number GSE26621. The statistically significantly expressed genes were used for the gene ontology analysis by the commercial gene pathway analysis web tool. Cells were grown, treated, fixed, and stained directly either in chamber slides, or on coverslips. Growth medium was removed, and cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Specifically for staining of ERM proteins, cells were fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in 4% paraformaldehyde. After three washes with PBS for 5 min each, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min followed by two washes with PBS for 5 min each. For blocking, 3% BSA in PBS was used for 1 h at room temperature followed by overnight incubation with primary antibodies in 3% BSA in PBS at 4 °C. Then cells were rinsed three times with PBS for 5 min each, and fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies in 3% BSA were added for 1 h at room temperature avoiding light exposure. After three washes with PBS for 5 min each, slides were coverslipped with Prolong® gold antifade reagents (Invitrogen), and cells were examined immediately using a Leica DMR microscope. For long term storage, slides were kept at 4 °C protected from light. Antibodies used were against F-actin (phalloidin-rhodamine, Invitrogen), phosphorylated ERM (Cell Signaling), CD24 (BD Biosciences), and CD29 (Millipore). For paraffin-embedded tissues, sections were first deparaffinized and hydrated and then placed in a water bath at 95–100 °C for 15 min for antigen retrieval by using citrate buffer (Thermo Scientific®). Slides were allowed to cool for 20 min followed by three washes with PBS for 5 min each. For permeabilization and reduction of unspecific fluorescence, 0.5% Triton X-100 was used for 5 min at 37 °C, and 0.5 mg/ml sodium borohydride was used for 10 min at room temperature, respectively. Blocking as well as primary and secondary antibody incubations were performed as described above. For immunofluorescent detection of apoptotic cells, the ApopTag® fluorescein in situ apoptosis detection kit was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore). To study the drug response of Brca1 mutant mammary tumors, we transplanted cells isolated from primary tumors of Brca1 mutant mice into nude mice and treated the recipient mice with several drugs that are commonly used for various forms of cancers, including ICI182,780, U1026, mifepristone (RU-486), rapamycin, and cisplatin (16.Lam L.

Our data revealed variable therapeutic effects of these drugs with cisplatin exhibiting the best antitumor effect, followed by rapamycin, whereas the other three drugs only partially inhibited tumor growth during the same period of the treatment (Fig. 1A). Because of this initial observation that cisplatin treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth, we further studied its therapeutic effect by starting the treatment when tumors reached about 200 mm3 in volume. We found that although cancer cells were initially very sensitive to cisplatin, they regressed quickly and then reached about 200 mm3 14 days later, when another dose of drug was injected (Fig. 1B). However, after the 4th dose of drug injection, tumors gradually became refractory to treatment. Of note, the drug resistance was accompanied by a significant increase in the number of cells double-positive for CD24 and CD29 (CD24+CD29+), which are markers for mammary cancer-initiating cells (or CSCs) in mice (13.Vassilopoulos A.

In particular, there was a 3-fold increase in the percentage of CD24+CD29+ cells in the cisplatin-treated tumors compared with mock-treated tumors at the end of the experiment, when tumor size was comparable between the two groups of tumors (Fig. 1, B and C) (75.3 ± 15.2% versus 26.4 ± 9.6%). Of note, when the presence of metastatic nodules in the lung was checked, we found that mice treated with cisplatin had a significantly lower incidence of metastasis. Although all (10/10) control mice developed lung metastasis (Fig. 1D, left panels), none of the 10 cisplatin-treated mice had visible metastatic tumors upon dissection, although three mice carried small focal areas of tumor cells in the lung when examined by H&E (Fig. 1D, right panels). The finding that cisplatin treatment markedly increased CSC population is consistent with the current view that drug resistance can be attributed to the failure of specifically targeting CSCs (14.Jain P.

However, the significant decrease in tumor metastasis despite the enrichment of CSCs in primary tumors was, at least on the surface, contradictory to the widely accepted observation that CSCs mediate cancer metastasis (10.Liu H.

Based on this information, we hypothesized that cisplatin treatment must have altered some features of CSCs, thereby decreasing their ability to metastasize. In our effort to explain this paradoxical finding, we tried to better analyze CSCs by identifying pathways that may contribute to the enhanced metastatic ability. Therefore, microarray analysis was performed by using both FACS-sorted CSCs and non-CSCs from three different primary mammary tumors from Brca1Co/Co;p53±;MMTV-Cre mice based upon expression of CD24 and CD29 as described earlier (15.Xu X.

Sci. 2008; 4: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from each of the subpopulations, and gene expression was compared between the Lin−CD24+CD29+ (CSCs) and the Lin−CD24−CD29− (non-CSCs) subpopulations. Genes differentially expressed with both p < 0.05 and fold change with absolute value of ≥2.0 using analysis of variance were identified in this comparison. Among the 1427 genes identified, 973 were up-regulated (ranging from 2- to 35-fold), and 454 genes were down-regulated (from 2- to 26-fold) (Fig. 2A and GEO database under submission number GSE26621). Analysis of these genes revealed that cytoskeletal remodeling and cell adhesion were among the 10 top pathways identified as differentially expressed in the cancer stem cell subpopulation (Fig. 2B). It is known that alteration of cytoskeletal remodeling and cell adhesion can have a significant effect on cell movement (27.Gritsenko P.G. Ilina O. Friedl P. Interstitial guidance of cancer invasion.J. Pathol. 2012; 226: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Considering our previous observation that CSCs mediate cancer metastasis (13.Vassilopoulos A. Chisholm C. Lahusen T. Zheng H. Deng C.X. A critical role of CD29 and CD49f in mediating metastasis for cancer-initiating cells isolated from a Brca1-associated mouse model of breast cancer.Oncogene. 2013; (10.1038/onc.2013.516)PubMed Google Scholar), we next compared four pathways that are involved in cytoskeletal remodeling, cell-matrix interaction, cell adhesion, and cell migration to identify the genes that are shared in these pathways (Fig. 2C). We identified 10 genes that are commonly up-regulated in the CSCs, including fibronectin, collagen IV (Col4a1, Col4a2, Col4a3, Col4a4, Col4a5, and Col4a6), and laminin (Lama1, -b1, and -c1) (Fig. 2D). In accordance with the microarray data, we confirmed increased expression of these genes by qRT-PCR in sorted out CSCs (Fig. 2E), and higher levels for both collagen and laminin were confirmed by Western blotting in cell lines positive for the presence of a CSC subpopulation (Fig. 2F). Collagen IV, laminins, and fibronectin are major proteins of the ECM. Collagen IV forms the basement membrane, in which laminins play important functions, including cell differentiation, growth, migration, and adhesion, whereas fibronectin is a glycoprotein that connects membrane-bound integrins and ECM (28.Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Fibronectin at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3861-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). Integrins are also connected to actin stress fibers and mediate cytoskeletal remodeling, and in this way, they are involved in cell migration and cancer metastasis (29.Barkan D. Green J.E"
https://openalex.org/W2016672998,"Seed development involves a plethora of spatially and temporally synchronised genetic and epigenetic processes. Although it has been shown that epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and chromatin remodelling, act on a large number of genes during seed development and germination, to date the global levels of histone modifications have not been studied in a tissue-specific manner in plant embryos. In this study we analysed the distribution of three epigenetic markers, i.e. H4K5ac, H3K4me2 and H3K4me1 in ‘matured’, ‘dry’ and ‘germinating’ embryos of a model grass, Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium). Our results indicate that the abundance of these modifications differs considerably in various organs and tissues of the three types of Brachypodium embryos. Embryos from matured seeds were characterised by the highest level of H4K5ac in RAM and epithelial cells of the scutellum, whereas this modification was not observed in the coleorhiza. In this type of embryos H3K4me2 was most evident in epithelial cells of the scutellum. In ‘dry’ embryos H4K5ac was highest in the coleorhiza but was not present in the nuclei of the scutellum. H3K4me1 was the most elevated in the coleoptile but absent from the coleorhiza, whereas H3K4me2 was the most prominent in leaf primordia and RAM. In embryos from germinating seeds H4K5ac was the most evident in the scutellum but not present in the coleoptile, similarly H3K4me1 was the highest in the scutellum and very low in the coleoptile, while the highest level of H3K4me2 was observed in the coleoptile and the lowest in the coleorhiza. The distinct patterns of epigenetic modifications that were observed may be involved in the switch of the gene expression profiles in specific organs of the developing embryo and may be linked with the physiological changes that accompany seed desiccation, imbibition and germination."

We analyzed the effect of environmental enrichment on retinal damage induced by experimental diabetes in adult Wistar rats. Diabetes was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Three days after vehicle or streptozotocin injection, animals were housed in enriched environment or remained in a standard environment. Retinal function (electroretinogram, and oscillatory potentials), retinal morphology, blood-retinal barrier integrity, synaptophysin, astrocyte and Müller cell glial fibrillary acidic protein, vascular endothelial growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, as well as lipid peroxidation were assessed in retina from diabetic animals housed in standard or enriched environment. Environmental enrichment preserved scotopic electroretinogram a-wave, b-wave and oscillatory potential amplitude, avoided albumin-Evan's blue leakage, prevented the decrease in retinal synaptophysin and astrocyte glial fibrillary acidic protein levels, the increase in Müller cell glial fibrillary acidic protein, vascular endothelial growth factor and tumor necrosis factor-α levels, as well as oxidative stress induced by diabetes. In addition, enriched environment prevented the decrease in retinal brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels induced by experimental diabetes. When environmental enrichment started 7 weeks after diabetes onset, retinal function was significantly preserved. These results indicate that enriched environment could attenuate the early diabetic damage in the retina from adult rats."
https://openalex.org/W2064114356,"Na(+)-pumping NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Na(+)-NQR) is responsible for maintaining a sodium gradient across the inner bacterial membrane. This respiratory enzyme, which couples sodium pumping to the electron transfer between NADH and ubiquinone, is not present in eukaryotes and as such could be a target for antibiotics. In this paper it is shown that the site of ubiquinone reduction is conformationally coupled to the NqrB subunit, which also hosts the final cofactor in the electron transport chain, riboflavin. Previous work showed that mutations in conserved NqrB glycine residues 140 and 141 affect ubiquinone reduction and the proper functioning of the sodium pump. Surprisingly, these mutants did not affect the dissociation constant of ubiquinone or its analog HQNO (2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide) from Na(+)-NQR, which indicates that these residues do not participate directly in the ubiquinone binding site but probably control its accessibility. Indeed, redox-induced difference spectroscopy showed that these mutations prevented the conformational change involved in ubiquinone binding but did not modify the signals corresponding to bound ubiquinone. Moreover, data are presented that demonstrate the NqrA subunit is able to bind ubiquinone but with a low non-catalytically relevant affinity. It is also suggested that Na(+)-NQR contains a single catalytic ubiquinone binding site and a second site that can bind ubiquinone but is not active."
https://openalex.org/W2038664934,"Temporal recalibration of cross-modal synchrony has been proposed as a mechanism to compensate for timing differences between sensory modalities. However, far from the rich complexity of everyday life sensory environments, most studies to date have examined recalibration on isolated cross-modal pairings. Here, we hypothesize that selective attention might provide an effective filter to help resolve which stimuli are selected when multiple events compete for recalibration. We addressed this question by testing audio-visual recalibration following an adaptation phase where two opposing audio-visual asynchronies were present. The direction of voluntary visual attention, and therefore to one of the two possible asynchronies (flash leading or flash lagging), was manipulated using colour as a selection criterion. We found a shift in the point of subjective audio-visual simultaneity as a function of whether the observer had focused attention to audio-then-flash or to flash-then-audio groupings during the adaptation phase. A baseline adaptation condition revealed that this effect of endogenous attention was only effective toward the lagging flash. This hints at the role of exogenous capture and/or additional endogenous effects producing an asymmetry toward the leading flash. We conclude that selective attention helps promote selected audio-visual pairings to be combined and subsequently adjusted in time but, stimulus organization exerts a strong impact on recalibration. We tentatively hypothesize that the resolution of recalibration in complex scenarios involves the orchestration of top-down selection mechanisms and stimulus-driven processes."

In total 420 habitats were sampled for larvae and/or pupae mosquitoes, resulting in more than 6,000 specimens. Forty species belonging to 15 genera were collected, with eight taxa integrated for the first time to the Mayotte mosquito list. The most frequently recorded species were Stegomyia aegypti, St. albopicta, Anopheles gambiae and Eretmapodites subsimplicipes, the first three species being known vectors of viruses and parasites transmitted to humans. Mean species richness in habitats ranged from 1.00 to 3.29, with notable differences between habitats. For example, water-filled axils of banana leaves, tree-holes and crab-holes had low species richness, while cut bamboo, water pools, abandoned tires and marsh and swamp water had notably higher species richness. Twenty-seven mosquito species belonging to 12 genera were routinely collected (in ≥20% of at least one type of larval habitat) suggesting that multiple species play a role in the biocenosis of these aquatic habitats. Multispecies association was observed in 52% of the habitats. The co-occurrence of up to six species belonging to five genera was recorded in a single habitat. The mosquitoes of Mayotte show notable biogeographical affinities to those of Madagascar, as compared to the African continent. These two potential source areas are nearly equidistant from Mayotte, which in turn indicates biased dispersal from east to west. Our findings suggest that with relatively short-term intensive sampling in different habitats, it is possible to approach exhaustive species inventories based on collection of larvae. Mayotte, with its modest elevation range and land surface, has a notable species richness of mosquitoes with 45 well-documented species belonging to 15 genera."
https://openalex.org/W2145057958,"Collagen IV is a family of 6 chains (α1-α6), that form triple-helical protomers that assemble into supramolecular networks. Two distinct networks with chain compositions of α121 and α345 have been established. These oligomerize into separate α121 and α345 networks by a homotypic interaction through their trimeric noncollagenous (NC1) domains, forming α121 and α345 NC1 hexamers, respectively. These are stabilized by novel sulfilimine (-S=N-) cross-links, a covalent cross-link that forms between Met(93) and Hyl(211) at the trimer-trimer interface. A third network with a composition of α1256 has been proposed, but its supramolecular organization has not been established. In this study we investigated the supramolecular organization of this network by determining the chain identity of sulfilimine-cross-linked NC1 domains derived from the α1256 NC1 hexamer. High resolution mass spectrometry analyses of peptides revealed that sulfilimine bonds specifically cross-link α1 to α5 and α2 to α6 NC1 domains, thus providing the spatial orientation between interacting α121 and α565 trimers. Using this information, we constructed a three-dimensional homology model in which the α565 trimer shows a good chemical and structural complementarity to the α121 trimer. Our studies provide the first chemical evidence for an α565 protomer and its heterotypic interaction with the α121 protomer. Moreover, our findings, in conjunction with our previous studies, establish that the six collagen IV chains are organized into three canonical protomers α121, α345, and α565 forming three distinct networks: α121, α345, and α121-α565, each of which is stabilized by sulfilimine bonds between their C-terminal NC1 domains."
https://openalex.org/W1995869358,"The acquisition of skeletal muscle-specific function and terminal cell cycle arrest represent two important features of the myogenic differentiation program. These cellular processes are distinct and can be separated genetically. The lineage-specific transcription factor MyoD and the retinoblastoma protein pRb participate in both of these cellular events. Whether and how MyoD and pRb work together to effect terminal cell cycle arrest is uncertain. To address this question, we focused on cyclin D1, whose stable repression is required for terminal cell cycle arrest and execution of myogenesis. MyoD and pRb are both required for the repression of cyclin D1; their actions, however, were found not to be direct. Rather, they operate to regulate the immediate early gene Fra-1, a critical player in mitogen-dependent induction of cyclin D1. Two conserved MyoD-binding sites were identified in an intronic enhancer of Fra-1 and shown to be required for the stable repression of Fra-1 and, in turn, cyclin D1. Localization of MyoD alone to the intronic enhancer of Fra-1 in the absence of pRb was not sufficient to elicit a block to Fra-1 induction; pRb was also recruited to the intronic enhancer in a MyoD-dependent manner. These observations suggest that MyoD and pRb work together cooperatively at the level of the intronic enhancer of Fra-1 during terminal cell cycle arrest. This work reveals a previously unappreciated link between a lineage-specific transcription factor, a tumor suppressor, and a proto-oncogene in the control of an important facet of myogenic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2000659400,"Drosophila Enhancer of split M8, an effector of Notch signaling, is regulated by protein kinase CK2. The phosphatase PP2A is thought to play an opposing (inhibitory) role, but the identity of the regulatory subunit was unknown. The studies described here reveal a role for the PP2A regulatory subunit widerborst (wdb) in three developmental contexts; the bristle, wing and the R8 photoreceptors of the eye. wdb overexpression elicits bristle and wing defects akin to reduced Notch signaling, whereas hypomorphic mutations in this PP2A subunit elicit opposite effects. We have also evaluated wdb functions using mutations in Notch and E(spl) that affect the eye. We find that the eye and R8 defects of the well-known Nspl mutation are enhanced by a hypomorphic allele of wdb, whereas they are strongly rescued by wdb overexpression. Similarly, ectopic wdb rescues the eye and R8 defects of the E(spl)D mutation, which affects the m8 gene. In addition, wdb overexpression also rescues the bristle defects of ectopically expressed M8, or the eye and R8 defects of its CK2 phosphomimetic variant M8-S159D. The latter finding suggests that PP2A may target M8 at highly conserved residues in the vicinity of the CK2 site, whose phosphorylation controls repression of Atonal and the R8 fate. Together, the studies identify PP2A-Wdb as a participant in Notch signaling, and suggest that M8 activity is controlled by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The conservation of the phosphorylation sites between Drosophila E(spl) and the HES/HER proteins from mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds and fish raises the prospect that this mode of regulation is widespread."
https://openalex.org/W2153762353,"Cognitive functions are stored in the connectome, the wiring diagram of the brain, which exhibits non-random features, so-called motifs. In this work, we focus on bidirectional, symmetric motifs, i.e. two neurons that project to each other via connections of equal strength, and unidirectional, non-symmetric motifs, i.e. within a pair of neurons only one neuron projects to the other. We hypothesise that such motifs have been shaped via activity dependent synaptic plasticity processes. As a consequence, learning moves the distribution of the synaptic connections away from randomness. Our aim is to provide a global, macroscopic, single parameter characterisation of the statistical occurrence of bidirectional and unidirectional motifs. To this end we define a symmetry measure that does not require any a priori thresholding of the weights or knowledge of their maximal value. We calculate its mean and variance for random uniform or Gaussian distributions, which allows us to introduce a confidence measure of how significantly symmetric or asymmetric a specific configuration is, i.e. how likely it is that the configuration is the result of chance. We demonstrate the discriminatory power of our symmetry measure by inspecting the eigenvalues of different types of connectivity matrices. We show that a Gaussian weight distribution biases the connectivity motifs to more symmetric configurations than a uniform distribution and that introducing a random synaptic pruning, mimicking developmental regulation in synaptogenesis, biases the connectivity motifs to more asymmetric configurations, regardless of the distribution. We expect that our work will benefit the computational modelling community, by providing a systematic way to characterise symmetry and asymmetry in network structures. Further, our symmetry measure will be of use to electrophysiologists that investigate symmetry of network connectivity."

We firstly carried out MTT assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry analysis and transwell invasion assay to determine effect of our compound HLC-080 on cell viability, anti-proliferation activity, cell cycle arrest and the intervention on cell invasion, respectively. On the other hand, in vivo antitumor activity of HLC-080 was also tested using H22 xenograft model and the angiogenesis effect of HLC-080 was measured by EA.hy926 tube formation assay. The expression levels of various proteins in HLC-080 treated with HT-29 cell lines were examined using Western blot and ELISA experiments. The results showed that HLC-080 could dramatically inhibit the growth and colony formation of various tumor cells, therefore exhibited remarkable antitumor activity. HLC-080 can induce cell cycle arrest at G1 phase in HT-29 cells and subsequently inhibit the invasive potential of colon cancer cells. HLC-080 also exhibits anti-angiogenesis effect in EA.hy926 model. Additionally, the in vivo study showed that HLC-080 was able to reduced the tumor weight with the rate of 35.81%. And at the concentration of 0.352±0.034 µM, HLC-080 is able to reduce half of the regular protein level of p-c-Raf (Ser259), consequently block Raf/MEK/ERK signaling in HT-29 cell lines. In conclusion, our study suggests that Sorafenib derivative HLC-080 has the potential to inhibit cell proliferation and angiogenesis, Since, HLC-080 is particularly active against human colon cancer cells, our study highlights that HLC-080 and its related analogues may serve as a new anti-cancer drug, particularly against colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2054867270,"Factors which modify the excretion profiles of acute kidney injury biomarkers are difficult to measure. To facilitate biomarker choice and interpretation we modelled key modifying factors: extent of hyperfiltration or reduced glomerular filtration rate, structural damage, and reduced nephron number. The time-courses of pre-formed, induced (upregulated), and filtered biomarker concentrations were modelled in single nephrons, then combined to construct three multiple-nephron models: a healthy kidney with normal nephron number, a non-diabetic hyperfiltering kidney with reduced nephron number but maintained total glomerular filtration rate, and a chronic kidney disease kidney with reduced nephron number and reduced glomerular filtration rate. Time-courses for each model were derived for acute kidney injury scenarios of structural damage and/or reduced nephron number. The model predicted that pre-formed biomarkers would respond quickest to injury with a brief period of elevation, which would be easily missed in clinical scenarios. Induced biomarker time-courses would be influenced by biomarker-specific physiology and the balance between insult severity (which increased single nephron excretion), the number of remaining nephrons (reduced total excretion), and the extent of glomerular filtration rate reduction (increased concentration). Filtered biomarkers have the longest time-course because plasma levels increased following glomerular filtration rate decrease. Peak concentration and profile depended on the extent of damage to the reabsorption mechanism and recovery rate. Rapid recovery may be detected through a rapid reduction in urinary concentration. For all biomarkers, impaired hyperfiltration substantially increased concentration, especially with chronic kidney disease. For clinical validation of these model-derived predictions the clinical biomarker of choice will depend on timing in relation to renal insult and interpretation will require the pre-insult nephron number (renal mass) and detection of hyperfiltration."

This study was designed to assess whether P wave parameters were associated with renal outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. This longitudinal study enrolled 439 patients with CKD stages 3-5. Renal end points were defined as the commencement of dialysis or death. Change in renal function was measured using the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope. We measured two ECG P wave parameters corrected for heart rate, i.e., corrected P wave dispersion and corrected maximum P wave duration. The values of P wave dispersion and maximum P wave duration were 88.8±21.7 ms and 153.3±21.7 ms, respectively. During the follow-up period (mean, 25.2 months), 95 patients (21.6%) started hemodialysis and 30 deaths (6.8%) were recorded. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified that increased P wave dispersion [hazard ratio (HR), 1.020; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.009-1.032; P<0.001] and maximum P wave duration (HR, 1.013; 95% CI, 1.003-1.024; P = 0.012) were associated with progression to renal end points. Furthermore, increased P wave dispersion (unstandardized coefficient β = -0.016; P = 0.037) and maximum P wave duration (unstandardized coefficient β = -0.014; P = 0.040) were negatively associated with the eGFR slope. We demonstrated that increased P wave dispersion and maximum P wave duration were associated with progression to the renal end points of dialysis or death and faster renal function decline in CKD patients.

However BRCA1/2 mutations could not explain the majority of cases arising in these patients. MicroRNAs (miRs) have been implicated in biological processes associated with BC. Therefore, we investigated differences in miRs expression between tumors from young patients (≤35 years) with sporadic or familial history and non-carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations. Thirty-six young Brazilian patients were divided into 2 groups: sporadic (NF-BC) or familial breast cancer (F-BC). Most of the samples were classified as luminal A and B and the frequency of subtypes did not differ between familial or sporadic cases. Using real time qPCR and discriminant function analysis, we identified 9 miRs whose expression levels rather than miR identity can discriminate between both patient groups. Candidate predicted targets were determined by combining results from miRWalk algorithms with mRNA expression profiles (n = 91 differently expressed genes). MiR/mRNA integrated analysis identified 91 candidate genes showing positive or negative correlation to at least 1 of the 9 miRs. Co-expression analysis of these genes with 9 miRs indicated that 49 differentially co-expressed miR-gene interactions changes in F-BC tumors as compared to those of NF-BC tumors. Out of 49, 17 (34.6%) of predicted miR-gene interactions showed an inverse correlation suggesting that miRs act as post-transcriptional regulators, whereas 14 (28.6%) miR-gene pairs tended to be co-expressed in the same direction indicating that the effects exerted by these miRs pointed to a complex level of target regulation. The remaining 18 pairs were not predicted by our criteria suggesting involvement of other regulators. MiR–mRNA co-expression analysis allowed us to identify changes in the miR-mRNA regulation that were able to distinguish tumors from familial and sporadic young BC patients non-carriers of BRCA mutations."

https://openalex.org/W2094971200,"Purpose To describe the corneal and anterior segment determinants of posterior corneal arc length (PCAL) and posterior corneal curvature (PCC). Methods Cross-sectional, population-based study of 1069 subjects (1069 eyes) aged 40–80 years, from three major Asian ethnic groups. All underwent anterior segment optical coherence tomography imaging and analysis with Zhongshan Angle Assessment Program. Our main outcome measures were determinants of PCAL and PCC using adjusted, multivariate linear regression analysis, adjusted for confounders to obtain the estimated marginal means (EMM) with standard error (SE). Results The overall mean (± SD) of PCC was: 6.51±0.39 mm; and PCAL was: 12.52±0.59 mm. Malays had a relatively longer PCAL (EMM = 12.74 mm, SE = 0.04 mm) than Chinese (EMM = 12.48 mm, SE = 0.03 mm, P<0.001), and Indians (EMM = 12.42 mm, SE = 0.03 mm, P<0.001). Anterior segment parameters had weak-moderate correlations with PCAL, which included: anterior chamber depth (ACD) (r = 0.55, P<0.001), PCC (r = 0.27, P<0.001), anterior corneal curvature (ACC) (r = 0.14, P<0.001) and central corneal thickness (CCT) (r = −0.07, P = 0.023). In multivariate analysis, anterior segment parameters explained only 37.6% of the variance of PCAL, with ACD being the most important determinant (partial R2 = 0.300; P<0.001). The determinants of PCC included ACC, PCAL and CCT (explaining 72.1% variation of PCC), with ACC being the most important determinant (partial R2 = 0.683; P<0.001). Conclusion There was moderate correlation of PCAL with ACD, but anterior segment parameters accounted for only a small proportion of the variation in PCAL. The significant differences in PCAL and PCC amongst different Asian ethnic groups suggests that there is a need to consider this factor when planning for anterior segment surgeries such as endothelial keratoplasty."
https://openalex.org/W2043039040,"Background While chronobiological studies have reported seasonal variation in panic attacks (PA) episodes, information on the timing of PA by week-days may enable better understanding of the triggers of PA episodes and thereby provide pointers for suitable interventional approaches to minimize PA attacks. This study investigated weekly variation in potential PA admissions including associations with holidays using a population-based longitudinal, administrative claims-based dataset in an Asian population. Methods This study used ambulatory care data from the “Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000. We identified 993 patients with panic disorder (PD), and they had 4228 emergency room (ER) admissions for potential PA in a 3-year period between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2011. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine associations between the potential PA admissions and holidays/weekend days/work-days of the week. Results The daily mean number of potential PA admissions was 3.96 (standard deviation 2.05). One-way ANOVA showed significant differences in potential PA admissions by holiday and day of the week (p<0.001). Daily frequencies showed a trough on Wednesday-Thursday, followed by a sharp increase on Saturday and a peak on Sunday. Potential PA admissions were higher than the daily mean for the sample patients by 29.4% and 22.1%, respectively on Sundays and holidays. Furthermore, the weekly variations were similar for females and males, although females always had higher potential PA admissions on both weekdays and holidays than the males. Conclusions We found that potential PA admissions among persons with PD varied systematically by day of the week, with a significant peak on weekends and holidays."
https://openalex.org/W2083997700,"Surgical patients are at risk for preventable adverse drug events (ADEs) during hospitalization. Usually, preventable ADEs are measured as an outcome parameter of quality of pharmaceutical care. However, process measures such as QIs are more efficient to assess the quality of care and provide more information about potential quality improvements.To assess the quality of pharmaceutical care of medication-related processes in surgical wards with quality indicators, in order to detect targets for quality improvements.For this observational cohort study, quality indicators were composed, validated, tested, and applied on a surgical cohort. Three surgical wards of an academic hospital in the Netherlands (Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam) participated. Consecutive elective surgical patients with a hospital stay longer than 48 hours were included from April until June 2009. To assess the quality of pharmaceutical care, the set of quality indicators was applied to 252 medical records of surgical patients.Thirty-four quality indicators were composed and tested on acceptability and content- and face-validity. The selected 28 candidate quality indicators were tested for feasibility and 'sensitivity to change'. This resulted in a final set of 27 quality indicators, of which inter-rater agreements were calculated (kappa 0.92 for eligibility, 0.74 for pass-rate). The quality of pharmaceutical care was assessed in 252 surgical patients. Nearly half of the surgical patients passed the quality indicators for pharmaceutical care (overall pass rate 49.8%). Improvements should be predominantly targeted to medication care related processes in surgical patients with gastro-intestinal problems (domain pass rate 29.4%).This quality indicator set can be used to measure quality of pharmaceutical care and detect targets for quality improvements. With these results medication safety in surgical patients can be enhanced."
