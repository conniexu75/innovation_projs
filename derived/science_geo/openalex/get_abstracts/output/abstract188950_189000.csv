https://openalex.org/W2134944475,"The bile salt-activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4) controls expression of several genes considered crucial in maintenance of bile salt homeostasis. We evaluated the physiological consequences of FXR deficiency on bile formation and on the kinetics of the enterohepatic circulation of cholate, the major bile salt species in mice. The pool size, fractional turnover rate, synthesis rate, and intestinal absorption of cholate were determined by stable isotope dilution and were related to expression of relevant transporters in the livers and intestines of FXR-deficient (Fxr –/–) mice. Fxr –/– mice showed only mildly elevated plasma bile salt concentrations associated with a 2.4-fold higher biliary bile salt output, whereas hepatic mRNA levels of the bile salt export pump were decreased. Cholate pool size and total bile salt pool size were increased by 67 and 39%, respectively, in Fxr –/– mice compared with wild-type mice. The cholate synthesis rate was increased by 85% in Fxr –/– mice, coinciding with a 2.5-fold increase in cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) and unchanged sterol 12α-hydroxylase (Cyp8b1) expression in the liver. Despite a complete absence of ileal bile acid-binding protein mRNA and protein, the fractional turnover rate and cycling time of the cholate pool were not affected. The calculated amount of cholate reabsorbed from the intestine per day was ∼2-fold higher in Fxr –/– mice than in wild-type mice. Thus, the absence of FXR in mice is associated with defective feedback inhibition of hepatic cholate synthesis, which leads to enlargement of the circulating cholate pool with an unaltered fractional turnover rate. The absence of ileal bile acid-binding protein does not negatively interfere with the enterohepatic circulation of cholate in mice.

The absence of ileal bile acid-binding protein does not negatively interfere with the enterohepatic circulation of cholate in mice. Bile salts, synthesized from cholesterol in the liver, have a number of important physiological functions in the body. Bile salts are essential for generation of bile flow and for biliary excretion of cholesterol. In the intestine, they are required for efficient absorption of dietary fat and fat-soluble vitamins (1Hofmann A.F. News Physiol. Sci. 1999; 14: 24-29PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, there is a growing body of evidence that bile salts are involved in the control of high density lipoprotein (2Claudel T. Sturm E. Duez H. Torra I.P. Sirvent A. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Dallongeville J. Hum D.W. Kuipers F. Staels B. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and very low density lipoprotein (3Kast H.R. Nguyen C.M. Sinal C.J.

To ensure the presence of adequate concentrations of these biologically active compounds at the sites of their actions, i.e. liver, biliary tract, and intestine, bile salts are maintained within the enterohepatic circulation by the combined actions of transporter systems in the liver and intestine. The bile salt export pump (BSEP 1The abbreviations used are: BSEP, bile salt export pump; ASBT, apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter; t-ASBT, truncated apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter; IBABP, ileal bile acid-binding protein; NTCP, Na+-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide; OATP, organic anion-transporting polypeptide; FXR, farnesoid X receptor; SHP, small heterodimer partner; LRH-1, liver receptor homologue-1; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; MDR, multidrug resistance; MRP, multidrug resistance protein.1The abbreviations used are: BSEP, bile salt export pump; ASBT, apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter; t-ASBT, truncated apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter; IBABP, ileal bile acid-binding protein; NTCP, Na+-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide; OATP, organic anion-transporting polypeptide; FXR, farnesoid X receptor; SHP, small heterodimer partner; LRH-1, liver receptor homologue-1; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; MDR, multidrug resistance; MRP, multidrug resistance protein.; ABCB11) has been identified as the major canalicular bile salt-transporting protein (6Gerloff T. Stieger B. Hagenbuch B. Madon J. Landmann L. Roth J. Hofmann A.F. Meier P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10046-10050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Intestinal absorption of bile salts is mediated, to a large extent, by the apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT; SLC10A2) localized in the terminal ileum (7Meier P.J. Stieger B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 635-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The ASBT splice variant t-ASBT is localized basolaterally and may be involved in efflux of bile salts from enterocytes toward portal blood (7Meier P.J. Stieger B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 635-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Ileal bile acid-binding protein (IBABP) is a small soluble protein, the expression of which is restricted to the terminal ileum. IBABP is thought to be involved in facilitating uptake of bile salts and their intracellular trafficking in the small intestine (8Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B. Science. 1999; 284: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2065) Google Scholar, 9Landrier J.F. Grober J. Zaghini I. Besnard P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 239: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After their reabsorption, bile salts are taken up by hepatocytes from portal blood via the Na+-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP; SLC10A1) and Na+-independent organic anion-transporting polypeptides, including OATP1 (or SLC21A1) (10Kullak-Ublick G.A. Stieger B. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 273-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Only a relatively small fraction of bile salts escapes intestinal absorption and is lost into the feces, which is compensated for by de novo bile salt biosynthesis in the liver. Therefore, under steady-state conditions, bile salt pool size remains constant. Recently, it has been become clear that bile salts exert regulatory actions on expression of specific genes via the nuclear hormone farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4) (8Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B. Science. 1999; 284: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2065) Google Scholar). Bile salts such as chenodeoxycholate, deoxycholate, cholate, and their conjugates are natural ligands for FXR. Activated FXR inhibits expression of the gene encoding cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) (11Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C. Roth M.E. Maloney P.R. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar), which catalyzes the first and rate-controlling step of bile salt synthesis (12Russell D.W. Setchell K.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4737-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). This repression is achieved indirectly via a coordinated regulatory cascade involving FXR-mediated induction of the small heterodimer partner (SHP; NROB2), which, in turn, inhibits the activity of the tissue-specific factor liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1; NR5A2), which controls expression of Cyp7a1 (11Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C. Roth M.E. Maloney P.R. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). In this way, bile salts exert negative feedback control on their own synthesis. Sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1), the enzyme that controls the ratio in which the primary bile salt species cholate and chenodeoxycholate are formed, seems to be under the negative control of bile salts in an FXR-dependent manner as well (13Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Activated FXR also controls expression of hepatic bile salt transporters, i.e. it induces expression of Bsep (14Ananthanarayanan M. Balasubramanian N. Makishima M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28857-28865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 15Plass J.R. Mol O. Heegsma J. Geuken M. Faber K.N. Jansen P.L. Muller M. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and down-regulates expression of Ntcp via SHP (16Denson L.A. Sturm E. Echevarria W. Zimmerman T.L. Makishima M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Karpen S.J. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 140-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that mouse (but not rat) ASBT is also subjected to negative feedback regulation mediated by FXR via SHP-dependent repression of LRH-1 activation (17Chen F. Ma L. Dawson P.A. Sinal C.J. Sehayek E. Gonzalez F.J. Breslow J. Ananthanarayanan M. Shneider B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19909-19916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Finally, bile salts strongly induce expression of intestinal Ibabp in an FXR-dependent manner (8Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B. Science. 1999; 284: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2065) Google Scholar, 18Grober J. Zaghini I. Fujii H. Jones S.A. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Ono T. Besnard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29749-29754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Therefore, in general terms, FXR appears to control various crucial steps in bile salt metabolism, which may provide possibilities for therapeutic interventions, e.g. aimed at treatment of hypercholesterolemia or of cholestatic liver diseases. However, in view of the wide variety of genes that are controlled by FXR, it is essential to understand the impact of induced alterations in FXR activity not only on expression of individual genes, but also on metabolism at the whole body level. Recent studies in chow-fed FXR-deficient mice by Sinal et al. (13Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar) showed increased hepatic Cyp7a1 mRNA levels, but, very surprisingly, reductions in total bile salt pool size and fecal bile salt loss. Counterintuitively, these data imply that, in the absence of functional FXR, bile salt synthesis would actually be suppressed. Other mouse models with increased Cyp7a1 expression (19Li-Hawkins J. Gafvels M. Olin M. Lund E.G. Andersson U. Schuster G. Bjorkhem I. Russell D.W. Eggertsen G. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1191-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 20Miyake J.H. Doung X.D. Strauss W. Moore G.L. Castellani L.W. Curtiss L.K. Taylor J.M. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23304-23311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) showed, as expected, increased bile salt synthesis rates and expansion of bile salt pool sizes. This may imply that FXR deficiency has an impact on maintenance of bile salt pool size at other levels, e.g. in the intestine. To address this issue further, we have evaluated parameters of the enterohepatic circulation of cholate, quantitatively the major bile salt species in the mouse, in relation to bile formation and expression of transport proteins in a new mouse model of FXR deficiency generated by the “classical” homologous recombination approach. For quantitation of cholate kinetic parameters, a recently developed stable isotope dilution technique was used (21Hulzebos C.V. Renfurm L. Bandsma R.H.J. Verkade H.J. Boer T. Boverhof R. Tanaka H. Mierau I. Sauer P.J.J. Kuipers F. Stellaard F. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1923-1929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study demonstrates that, in accordance with derepressed transcription of Cyp7a1, Fxr –/– mice do show an increased cholate synthesis rate. Interestingly, the calculated intestinal cholate reabsorption was markedly increased despite a complete absence of Ibabp mRNA and protein, leading to an enlarged bile salt pool size. This finding may imply that IBABP functions as a negative regulator rather than as a positive regulator of intestinal bile salt reabsorption in the mouse. Animals—Fxr –/– mice were generated by Deltagen, Inc. (Redwood City, CA) using standard gene-targeting methods. To disrupt the Fxr locus, a 292-bp fragment corresponding to a segment of exon 2 was replaced with a phosphoglycerate kinase promoter-driven neomycin resistance cassette in a targeting vector. The construct was linearized and electroporated into embryonic stem cells derived from the 129/OlaHsd strain. Cells harboring the desired mutation were identified by positive selection and injected into recipient C57BL/6J blastocysts to produce chimeras, which were used for the generation of F1 heterozygotes. F2 wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mice were produced by F1 intercross in at expected mendelian ratios. Genotyping was accomplished by PCR using primer pairs specific for the wild-type Fxr allele (5′-GTT GTA GTG GTA CCC AGA GGC CCT G-3′ and 5′-TAT GCT AAC AGA ACA CGC GGC AGG C-3′) or the mutant allele (5′-GTT GTA GTG GTA CCC AGA GGC CCT G-3′ and 5′-GGG TGG GAT TAG ATA AAT GCC TGC TCT-3′). Male homozygous (Fxr –/–), heterozygous (Fxr +/–), and wild-type (Fxr + / +) mice (C57BL/6J-129/OlaHsd; 25–30 g) were bred at the animal facility of the University of Groningen and used for these studies. Mice were housed in a light- and temperature-controlled facility. Food and water were available ad libitum, and mice were maintained on standard laboratory chow (RMH-B, Hope Farms B. V., Woerden, The Netherlands). Materials—[2,2,4,4-2H]Cholate ([2H4]cholate, isotopic purity of 98%) was obtained from ISOTEC (Miamisburg, OH). Cholylglycine hydrolase from Clostridium perfringens welchii was purchased from Sigma. Pentafluorobenzyl bromide was purchased from Fluka Chemie (Buchs, Neu-Ulm, Switzerland). All other chemicals and solvents used were of the highest purity commercially available. Methods—Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of Hypnorm (1 ml/kg) and diazepam (10 mg/kg) (Janssen Pharmaceutica, Beerse, Belgium). Six Fxr –/– mice, six Fxr +/– mice, and six wild-type mice were subjected to bile duct cannulation for collection of bile (22Kuipers F. van Ree J.M. Hofker M.H. Wolters H. In't Veld G. Havinga R. Vonk R.J. Princen H.M. Havekes L.M. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 241-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the 30-min bile collection period, animals were placed in a humidified incubator to ensure maintenance of body temperature. Bile flow was determined gravimetrically, assuming a density of 1 g/ml for bile. Bile was stored at –20 °C until analyzed. Blood was obtained by cardiac puncture and collected in EDTA-containing tubes. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 10 min and stored at –80 °C until analyzed. The livers were excised, weighed, cut into small pieces, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until used for isolation of RNA and for biochemical analyses. Samples for microscopic evaluation were frozen in isopentane and stored at –80 °C or fixed in paraformaldehyde for hematoxylin/eosin and oil red O staining. The small intestine was rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche Applied Science) to prevent protein degradation and divided in proximal, mid, and distal parts. Tissue samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C for membrane preparation and for RNA isolation. Feces were lyophilized, weighed, and homogenized. To collect urine, four wild-type and four Fxr –/– mice were placed in metabolic cages that allowed for separate collection of feces and urine for a period of 24 h. In a second experiment, 240 μg of [2H4]cholate in a solution of 0.5% NaHCO3 in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) was intravenously administered to male Fxr + / + and Fxr –/– mice. Subsequently, blood samples (100 μl) were obtained at 24, 36, 48, and 60 h after administration of [2H4]cholate. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 10 min and stored at –20 °C until analyzed. After 60 h, the mice were anesthetized with Hypnorm and diazepam (see above) and subjected to bile duct cannulation (22Kuipers F. van Ree J.M. Hofker M.H. Wolters H. In't Veld G. Havinga R. Vonk R.J. Princen H.M. Havekes L.M. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 241-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that hepatic production was accurately measured, bile produced during the initial 5 min after cannulation was discarded, and bile was sampled for 30 min thereafter. Steady-state mRNA Levels Determined by Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated from frozen mouse liver and intestinal tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was checked on an agarose gel for integrity, and RNA concentration was measured using the Ribogreen RNA quantitation kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Leiden, The Netherlands). Reverse transcription was performed on 2.5 μg of total RNA using random primers in a final volume of 38 μl (reverse transcription system, Promega, Madison, WI) for 10 min at 25 °C, followed by 1 h at 45 °C. Samples were subsequently heated for 5 min at 95 °C to terminate the reverse transcription reaction. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed on cDNA samples as described by Heid et al. (55Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (4940) Google Scholar) to quantify mRNA levels.

Primers and detection probes for the gene of interest, labeled with a fluorescent reporter dye (6-carboxyfluorescein) and a fluorescent quenching dye (6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine), were added. Fluorescence was measured using ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector Version 1.6 software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For every PCR, β-actin was used as the internal control. The cycle number at the threshold, after which the intensity of reporter fluorescent emission increases, was used to quantitate the PCR product. Preparation of Intestinal Membranes for Protein Analysis—Intestinal brush-border membranes were isolated as described by Schmitz et al. (25Schmitz J. Preiser H. Maestracci D. Ghosh B.K. Cerda J.J. Crane R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 323: 98-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Total protein concentration of intestinal homogenates and brush-border membrane fractions was determined using the method described by Lowry et al. (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough A.L. Farr A.L. Randal R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Approximately 2.5 μg of protein from homogenates and from intestinal brush-border membrane fractions of each group was separated using 4–15% Tris-HCl ready gradient gels (BioRad) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) using a tankblotting system (Bio-Rad). The IBABP protein content in intestinal homogenates and the ASBT protein content in brush-border membranes were determined using recombinant anti-murine IBABP antibody (27Labonte E.D. Li Q. Kay C.M. Agellon L.B. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 28: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and polyclonal antihamster ASBT antibody (28Torchia, E. C., Stolz, A., and Agellon, L. B. (2001) BMC Biochemistry http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/2/11Google Scholar), respectively. The blots were incubated with the first antibody diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% dried milk powder and 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma), washed with Trisbuffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences). Detection was done using the ECL Western blot kit (Amersham Biosciences). Analyses—Bile salt concentrations in plasma, bile, feces, and urine were determined by an enzymatic fluorimetric assay (29Mashige F. Imai K. Osuga T. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1976; 70: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Levels of biliary cholesterol, phospholipids, and GSH were measured as described by Kuipers et al. (30Kuipers F. Havinga R. Bosschieter H. Toorop G.P. Hindriks F.R. Vonk R.J. Gastroenterology. 1985; 88: 403-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase activities and total bilirubin concentrations in plasma were determined by routine clinical chemical procedures. Gas Chromatography—Bile salt composition of bile samples was determined by capillary gas chromatography on a Hewlett-Packard gas chromatograph (HP 5880A) equipped with a 50 m × 0.32 mm CP-Sil-19 fused silica column (Chrompack B. V., Middelburg, The Netherlands). For this purpose, bile salts were converted to their methyl ester/trimethylsilyl derivatives (21Hulzebos C.V. Renfurm L. Bandsma R.H.J. Verkade H.J. Boer T. Boverhof R. Tanaka H. Mierau I. Sauer P.J.J. Kuipers F. Stellaard F. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1923-1929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thin-layer Chromatography—Conjugation patterns of biliary bile salts were analyzed by TLC on precoated silica gels (60F254, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) using 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (10:2:1) as the solvent system (31Parmentier G. Eyssen H. J. Chromatogr. 1978; 152: 285-289Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Gas-Liquid Chromatography/Electron Capture Negative Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry—Plasma samples were prepared for isotopic analysis of bile salts by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry as described (21Hulzebos C.V. Renfurm L. Bandsma R.H.J. Verkade H.J. Boer T. Boverhof R. Tanaka H. Mierau I. Sauer P.J.J. Kuipers F. Stellaard F. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1923-1929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All analyses were performed on a Finnigan MAT SSQ7000 quadrupole gas chromatography/mass spectrometry instrument. Gas chromatographic separation was performed on a 15 m × 0.25-mm column (0.25-μm film thickness; AT-5MS, Alltech Associates Inc., Deerfield, IL). Isotope Dilution Technique Calculations—The isotope dilution technique has been described in detail by Hulzebos et al. (21Hulzebos C.V. Renfurm L. Bandsma R.H.J. Verkade H.J. Boer T. Boverhof R. Tanaka H. Mierau I. Sauer P.J.J. Kuipers F. Stellaard F. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1923-1929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enrichment was defined as the increase in M4-cholate/M0-cholate relative to baseline measurements after administration of [2H4]cholate and is expressed as the natural logarithm of the atom percent excess (ln APE) value. The decay of ln APE (atom percent excess) in time was calculated by linear regression analysis for the individual mice. From the linear decay curve thus obtained, the fractional turnover rate and pool size of cholate were calculated. The fractional turnover rate per day equals the slope of the regression line. The pool size (micromoles/100 g) was determined according to the following formula: ((D × b × 100)/ea) – D, where D is the administered amount of label, b is the isotopic purity, and a is the intercept on the y axis of ln APE versus time curve. The cholate synthesis rate (micromoles/100 g/day) was determined by multiplying the pool size and fractional turnover rate. Enterohepatic Cycling Time and Intestinal Reabsorption of Cholate— The cholate cycling time, i.e. the time it takes the cholate pool to circulate a single time in the enterohepatic circulation, was calculated by dividing the cholate pool size (micromoles/100 g) by the biliary secretion rate of cholate (micromoles/100 g/h). The cholate biliary secretion rate was calculated by multiplying the bile flow (microliters/100 g/h) by the cholate concentration (millimolar) in a single 30-min fraction, obtained from 5 to 35 min after cannulation of the gallbladder. The amount of cholate reabsorbed per day was calculated by multiplying cholate pool size by cycling frequency and subsequent subtraction of the daily cholate synthesis rate. Statistical Analyses—All results are presented as means ± S.D. Differences between the two or three groups were determined by t test or one-way analysis of variance, with post hoc comparison by Newman-Keuls' t test, respectively. The level of significance for all statistical analyses was set at p < 0.05. Analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Deletion of the Fxr Gene—Mutation of the Fxr gene was accomplished by replacement of 292 bp of exon 2 with a neomycin resistance cassette conferring antibiotic resistance (Fig. 1A). Homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells, injection into blastocysts, and transmission of the mutation through the mouse germ line were carried out by standard methods. The loss of ∼97 amino acids encoded by exon 2 was anticipated to remove a part of the DNA-binding domain of the FXR protein. PCR analysis of genomic DNA confirmed the predicted recombinations (Fig. 1B). RNA blotting revealed an Fxr transcript of ∼2.0 kb in the livers of wild-type mice, whereas no transcript was detectable in Fxr –/– mice (Fig. 1C). Animal Characteristics—The body and liver weights of Fxr –/– and Fxr +/– mice at 3 months of age were slightly higher than those of wild-type mice, but liver weight/body weight ratios were not affected (Table I). There were no differences in plasma alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and bilirubin concentrations among Fxr –/–, Fxr +/–, and Fxr + / + mice. Plasma bile salt concentrations were only slightly increased in Fxr –/– mice, in contrast to previously reported data in another strain of Fxr –/– mice described by Sinal et al. (13Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Accordingly, urinary bile salt loss was not significantly different between wild-type and Fxr –/–"
https://openalex.org/W2067541521,"ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1), the defective transporter in Tangier disease, binds and promotes cellular cholesterol and phospholipid efflux to apolipoprotein I (apoA-I). Based on a high degree of sequence homology between ABCA1 and ABCA7, a transporter of unknown function, we investigated the possibility that ABCA7 might be involved in apolipoprotein binding and lipid efflux. Similarly to cells expressing ABCA1, HEK293 cells overexpressing ABCA7 showed specific binding and cross-linking of lipid-poor apoA-I. ABCA7 expression increased cellular phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin efflux to apoA-I in a manner similar to ABCA1 but had no effect on cholesterol efflux. Western analysis showed a high protein level of ABCA7 in mouse spleen, lung, adrenal, and brain but low expression in liver. In contrast to ABCA1, ABCA7 showed moderate basal mRNA and protein levels in macrophages and lymphocytes but no induction by liver X receptor activation. These studies show that ABCA7 has the ability to bind apolipoproteins and promote efflux of cellular phospholipids without cholesterol, and they suggest a possible role of ABCA7 in cellular phospholipid metabolism in peripheral tissues."

According to the World Health Organization, as of the July 9, 2003 there have been 8436 reported probable cases of SARS worldwide including 812 deaths (www.who.int/csr/sars/en). Although this initial global outbreak of SARS appears to have been successfully contained, SARS will remain a serious concern while there continues to be no suitable vaccine or effective drug treatment. The coronaviruses and arteriviruses belong to the order Nidovirales, members of which share a similar polycistronic genomic composition and organization (6Ziebuhr J. Snijder E.J. Gorbalenya A.E. J.

The 29.7-kb SARS-CoV genome is dominated by a 21.2-kb replicase gene (orf1ab) in the 5′-most region, which incorporates a ribosomal slippage site (3Rota P.A. Oberste M.S. Monroe S.S. Nix W.A.

Termination of translation without ribosomal frameshifting generates the Orf1a protein, while the (–1) frameshift results in translation of the extended Orf1ab polyprotein (pp1ab) (7Lai M.M. Cavanagh D. Adv. Virus Res. 1997; 48: 1-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These two initial translation products are then autoproteolytically processed primarily by the main proteinase (Mpro, also called 3CLpro), encoded within the 5′-proximal region of the replicase gene (6Ziebuhr J. Snijder E.J. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 853-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), to release a number of non-structural proteins (nsPs), including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, nsP9) and the NTPase/helicase (Hel, nsP10). Within the N-terminal region of the predicted SARS-CoV Hel protein is a cysteine-rich putative metal binding domain (MBD), which from mutational studies in the related equine arteritis virus (EAV) has been implicated in subgenomic mRNA synthesis, genome replication, and virion biogenesis (8van Dinten L.C. van Tol H.

Antiviral Res. 2002; 55: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As a foundation to the development of specific SARS-CoV NTPase/helicase inhibitors, we have cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized the biochemical properties of the SARS-CoV NTPase/helicase domain. Source DNA and Cloning—Cultured Vero cells were infected with SARS coronavirus strain HKU 39487. Total RNA was isolated with TRIZOL (Invitrogen) as instructed by the manufacturer. Purified RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers. The NTPase/helicase domain (nsP10) was amplified by PCR, using AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems) with the forward primer 5′-GGCGGATCCGCCATGGCTGTAGGTGCTTGTGTATTG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GGCCTCGAGTCATTGTAATGTAGCCACATTGCG-3′. The PCR product was gel purified, digested with BamHI/XhoI and ligated with a similarly digested pET28a(+) vector (Novagen) to make the plasmid pHelA12. Protein Purification—4 liters of LB broth supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) were inoculated with saturated pHelA12/BL21 (DE3) culture (1/200 dilution) and grown at 37 °C until A 600 = 0.6. Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm), and cultures were incubated at 25 °C for 6 h. After cooling to 4 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in Buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science), 1 g of wet cell pellet/5 ml of buffer). Cells were lysed by sonication (Sonics VibraCell, microtip, 30% power for 3 min (4 s on, 10 s off) with ice cooling) and then centrifuged (30 min, 30,000 × g), and the supernatant was filtered (Corning syringe filter, 0.45 μm) and then applied to 2 × 5 ml nickel-charged HiTrap chelating columns directly connected in series (Amersham Biosciences). The 10-ml column was washed with 100 ml of Buffer A, then 50 ml Buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl) before eluting the protein with a stepwise gradient over 100 ml versus Buffer C (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 250 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl). Collected fractions (2 ml) were immediately diluted with 2 ml of Buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), 10% glycerol) to reduce protein precipitation. The purest fractions (determined by SDS-PAGE) were combined, dialyzed against 500 volumes of Buffer D, and then filtered (0.45 μm) before application to a column containing 0.5 ml of Red Sepharose CL-6B resin (Amersham Biosciences). The resin was washed with 5 ml of Buffer B (containing 5 mm β-ME), before elution with a stepwise gradient over 10 ml versus Buffer E (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50 mm imidazole, 2 m NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mm β-ME, 2% Nonidet P-40). Pure fractions (by SDS-PAGE) were combined and stored at 4 °C for short term or frozen at –70 °C for long term storage. NTPase Assays—NTPase assays were performed by measuring phosphate release using a colorimetric method based on complexation with malachite green and molybdate (AM/MG reagent) (17Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 18Wardell A.D. Errington W. Ciaramella G. Merson J. McGarvey M.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In a 50-μl volume, typically 0.2–0.7 pmol of protein, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 25 μg/ml poly(U) (Amersham Biosciences, s 20, w = 4.8) were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, and then the color was developed for 5 min following the addition of 200 μl of AM/MG reagent (0.034% malachite green, 1.05% ammonium molybdate, 0.04% Tween 20, in 1 m HCl). 40 μl of 34% (w/v) trisodium citrate dihydrate was then added and the A 630 read, typically using a 96-well plate reader. For the assays stimulated by homopolynucleotides, the polynucleotide concentration was accurately measured using the A 260 and quoted as a molar concentration of 24-mer. The amount of phosphate released was quantified by comparison with a standard phosphate calibration curve. Data were fitted using Origin (Microcal Software). Preparation of Duplex DNA Substrates—The synthetic oligonucleotide “released” (5′-GGTGCAGCCGCAGCGGTGCTCG-3′, Proligo (Singapore), de-salted) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Labeled DNA was purified by desalting (AutoSeq G-50 spin column, Amersham Biosciences), phenol:chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation and was resuspended in deionized water. The labeled released oligo (100 pmol) was annealed to 150 pmol of oligos “Tblunt” (5′-CGAGCACCGCTGCGGCTGCACC-3′), “3T20” (5′-CGAGCACCGCTGCGGCTGCACCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′), and “5T20” (5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCGAGCACCGCTGCGGCTGCACC-3′) in 100 μl of Buffer F (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaCl) by heating to 95 °C for 5 min, followed by gradual cooling to room temperature at 0.5–1 °C/min, to form substrate DNA duplexes dB, d3T, and d5T, respectively. DNA duplexes were not purified further. Duplex DNA-unwinding Assays—Purified helicase protein (typically 6 pmol) was incubated with the labeled duplex DNA (30 fmol) in 60 μl of Buffer G (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 2.5 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol) for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were halted by the addition of 15 μl of gel loading buffer (5% SDS, 100 mm EDTA, 15% w/v Ficoll, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue), and the products (25 μl) were immediately resolved on 15% polyacrylamide gels (29:1 acrylamide: bisacrylamide in (×1) TBE (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, 10 mm EDTA)). For the positive control, labeled duplex DNA (30 fmol) in 60 μl of Buffer F was denatured by heating to 95 °C for 5 min and then flash cooling in liquid nitrogen. Gels were analyzed on a Storm 860 PhosphorImager using ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of the Putative SARS Coronavirus NTPase/Helicase—A bacterial expression system was used to produce the SARS-CoV NTPase/helicase (Hel) in quantities suitable for enzymatic studies. SARS-CoV strain HKU 39487 was used to infect Vero cells, and total RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed with random hexamers. PCR primers were designed to amplify the region coding for the full-length Hel domain (nsP10), as defined by the helicase Mpro proteolytic sites: Leu-Gln↓ (Ser, Ala, Gly) based on the work by Anand et al. (12Anand K. Ziebuhr J. Wadhwani P. Mesters J.R. Hilgenfeld R. Science. 2003; 300: 1763-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). The PCR product of the expected length was ligated into a pET28a(+) expression vector, thereby introducing a small hexahistidine-T7 tag at the N terminus of the protein, to facilitate subsequent purification. Sequencing confirmed that the cloned PCR fragment was identical to that of the deposited sequence (NCBI accession number: NC_004718) apart from a silent CCC to CCG variation present at position 16,325. The His-tagged protein was purified from the soluble fraction using nickel affinity chromatography, followed by dye-affinity chromatography, resulting in a single band of the expected mass of ∼70 kDa, as observed by SDS-PAGE after staining with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1, panel A). Typical yields were 1–2 mg of purified protein/liter of bacterial culture. DNA Duplex-unwinding Activity of the SARS Coronavirus NTPase/Helicase—Three radiolabeled DNA duplex and partial duplex substrates were prepared to probe the activity of the recombinant helicase protein in a fully defined in vitro system. The dB substrate was fully double-stranded (blunt ended), while d3T and d5T each contained a 20-residue 3′- or 5′-poly(dT) tail, respectively (Fig. 1, panel B), analogous to the system used by Seybert et al. (19Seybert A. Hegyi A. Siddell S.G. Ziebuhr J. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1056-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). One strand in each of the three annealed duplexes, referred to as the released strand (10Kadare G. Haenni A.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2583-2590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was 5′-end-labeled with 32PO4, so that the substrate duplex and single-stranded DNA products could be resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by phosphorimaging. When incubated with the helicase, only the d5T partial duplex with the 5′ single-stranded DNA tail was unwound to release the labeled strand (Fig. 1, panel C). This activity was entirely dependent upon the presence of ATP (Fig. 1, panel C) and Mg2+ (data not shown). Neither the fully double-stranded duplex (dB) nor a partial duplex with a 3′ single-stranded tail (d3T) could be unwound by the SARS-CoV helicase, indicating that it has activity with specific 5′ to 3′ polarity. We also show that the release of the labeled strand from the d5T duplex correlated with the quantity of helicase present in the reaction (Fig. 1, panel D). ATPase Activity of the SARS Coronavirus NTPase/Helicase— The ATPase activity was quantified using a sensitive colorimetric assay that measures the total amount of orthophosphate released, based on the highly colored complex of phosphomolybdate and malachite green (17Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The assays were performed in parallel on a 50 μl scale, using a standard 96-well plate. In the absence of ssDNA or RNA, there was a basal rate of ATPase activity of ∼0.4 s–1. As found for all other RNA helicases studied to date (10Kadare G. Haenni A.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2583-2590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the ATPase activity of the SARS-CoV Hel was absolutely dependent on Mg2+, as no NTPase activity was observed when a molar excess of EDTA was added to sequester the Mg2+ (data not shown). Mn2+ (as a chloride salt) could substitute for Mg2+, but with reduced relative efficiency (∼40% at 2.5 mm, data not shown). The ATPase activity was stimulated significantly (15–25-fold) by the addition of most homopolyribo- and deoxyribonucleotides, in particular poly(U) (Fig. 2). However, the addition of either poly(G)24 or poly(dG)24 caused only a very minor increase in the ATPase activity of the helicase. Due to the significant stimulatory effect of poly(U), this was used as the standard polynucleotide for further analysis of the NTPase activities of the SARS-CoV Hel. Comparison of NTP Substrates in the NTPase Reaction—The SARS-CoV helicase was able to hydrolyze all eight common NTPs and dNTPs in a magnesium-dependent reaction that was highly stimulated by certain polynucleotides (Fig. 3, panel A). At lower concentrations of NTP (<1 mm), hydrolysis followed simple single-site Michaelis-Menten behavior, with the values of Km, kcat , and the specificity constant kcat /Km shown in Table I. Judging by the specificity constant, ATP, dATP, and dCTP were the “best” substrates of those tested in the NTPase assay. At higher concentrations (>1 mm) of ATP (and to a lesser extent for GTP and CTP) there was a marked reduction in NTPase activity, indicative of substrate inhibition, whereas the other NTPs continued to follow single-site Michaelis-Menten behavior.Table IRate constants for the NTPase activity of the SARS coronavirus NTPase/helicaseKmKcatk cat/Kmmms-1mm-1 s-1ATP0.3319.157.9CTP0.4713.929.6GTP0.205.427.0UTP0.5510.519.1dATP0.2014.874.0dCTP0.2214.365.0dGTP0.357.521.4dUTP0.9314.815.9 Open table in a new tab Determination of the Strengths of Binding of Polynucleotides to the SARS Coronavirus NTPase/Helicase—The concentration that gave half-maximal stimulation of dATPase activity was measured for a selection of polynucleotides (24-mers), to obtain a set of apparent Km values. dATP was used in place of ATP as it was impossible to use ATP at a non-rate-limiting concentration due to substrate inhibition at higher ATP concentrations. When the concentration of dATP was non-rate-limiting, the dATPase activity of the enzyme displayed simple single-site behavior with respect to the concentration of the single-stranded polynucleotide present (Fig. 3, panel B). Apparent half-maximal stimulation values ( Kmapp ) for the binding of poly(dA)24, poly(dC)24, poly(dT)24, and poly(U)24 to the SARS-CoV Hel were determined by fitting a simple Michaelis-Menten model to the ATPase data. The values obtained were 900, 165, 37, and 150 nm, respectively. The maximal rate of stimulation by (dT)24 appeared higher relative to the other polynucleotides in the presence of dATP (Fig. 3, panel B) as opposed to ATP (as in Fig. 2), but otherwise similar experiments using 1 mm ATP gave similar values for Kmapp (results not shown). The Kmapp values for poly(G)24 and poly(dG)24 could not be determined, due to the extremely low level of NTPase stimulation that their addition elicited. Poly(dT)24 stimulated the dATPase activity at the lowest concentrations: the most simple model would therefore suggest that poly(dT)24 binds most strongly to Hel. On the basis of sequence homology, helicases are divided into five major groups: the superfamilies SF-1, SF-2, and SF-3, a fourth family consisting of helicases related to the Escherichia coli DnaB protein, and a fifth family typified by the transcription termination factor Rho (20Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The majority of the viral helicases that have been characterized to date belong to SF-2, as typified by the hepatitis C virus ns3 helicase domain, for which a crystal structure was solved 6 years ago (21Yao N. Hesson T. Cable M. Hong Z. Kwong A.D. Le H.V. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The primary sequence of the predicted SARS-CoV Hel, however, places it in SF-1, a less well characterized family with regards to its viral helicase members. Initial studies on virus-encoded helicases from SF-1 showed ATPase activity but no detectable helicase activity (10Kadare G. Haenni A.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2583-2590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the HCoV 229E NTPase/helicase was shown to have DNA and RNA duplex-unwinding activity with a 5′ to 3′ polarity (19Seybert A. Hegyi A. Siddell S.G. Ziebuhr J. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1056-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), as was found for the EAV helicase from the closely related arterivirus family (22Seybert A. van Dinten L.C. Snijder E.J. Ziebuhr J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9586-9593Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Studies on a helicase from a further arterivirus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus confirmed a strict 5′ to 3′ polarity (23Bautista E.M. Faaberg K.S. Mickelson D. McGruder E.D. Virology. 2002; 298: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our results show that the SARS-CoV Hel has very similar properties to these three helicases: a 5′ to 3′ polarity of unwinding and a stimulation of ATPase activity by single stranded polynucleotides. This stands in stark contrast to the SF-2 viral helicases, which display a 3′ to 5′ polarity of unwinding (18Wardell A.D. Errington W. Ciaramella G. Merson J. McGarvey M.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although it was previously suggested that a 5′ to 3′ unwinding was a signature of all SF-1 viral helicases (19Seybert A. Hegyi A. Siddell S.G. Ziebuhr J. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1056-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), it has recently been reported that SF-1 helicases from two hordeiviruses and a potexvirus (both plant (+) ssRNA viruses) unwind RNA duplexes in both directions (24Kalinina N.O. Rakitina D.V. Solovyev A.G. Schiemann J. Morozov S.Y. Virology. 2002; 296: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This would suggest that helicases of the Nidovirales (including coronaviruses and arteriviruses), possibly together with SF1 helicases from other animal (+) ssRNA viruses (including alphaviruses, rubiviruses, and hepatitis E viruses) form a distinct class of 5′ to 3′ RNA viral helicases within SF-1 (see Supplementary Material). The SARS-CoV Hel hydrolyzed all eight common NTPs and dNTPs, exhibiting a marked preference for ATP, dATP, and dCTP (Fig. 3, panel A, and Table I). The ability of Hel to hydrolyze a wide variety of NTPs and dNTPs is consistent with the triphosphate moiety forming the basis of the recognition factor for binding and hydrolysis, as has been suggested for the hepatitis C virus ns3 helicase (18Wardell A.D. Errington W. Ciaramella G. Merson J. McGarvey M.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). It is possible that this lack of selectivity in NTP hydrolysis also enables the Hel to act as a broad RNA 5′-triphosphatase in viral 5′ capping, as reported for a related potexvirus helicase (26Li Y.I. Shih T.W. Hsu Y.H. Han Y.T. Huang Y.L. Meng M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12114-12120Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The ATP hydrolysis rate decreased at higher ATP concentrations, suggesting that ATP may be able to bind to a weaker set of ATP-binding sites in a putative homomultimeric enzyme complex, thereby inhibiting the net ATPase activity of the enzyme (16Borowski P. Schalinski S. Schmitz H. Antiviral Res. 2002; 55: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27Borowski P. Niebuhr A. Mueller O. Bretner M. Felczak K. Kulikowski T. Schmitz H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3220-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The basal ATPase activity of Hel was stimulated by most polynucleotides 15–25-fold, with the exception of poly(G) and poly(dG) (Fig. 2). Variation in strength of homopolynucleotide binding was particularly significant (Fig. 3, panel B), suggesting that the SARS-CoV Hel may possess elements of secondary structure/sequence recognition capability. We speculate that this specificity may play a role in the localization of a putative RdRp-helicase complex to selected genomic locations during subgenomic RNA synthesis, augmenting proposed base-pairing factors (28Pasternak A.O. van den Born E. Spaan W.J. Snijder E.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7220-7228Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The 5′ to 3′ direction of unwinding suggests to us that the helicase may aid the replicative process by disrupting secondary structure or displacing bound proteins and annealed RNA fragments, putative roles that will require experimental validation. Mutational studies on the EAV MBD have suggested that this region is involved in virion biogenesis, subgenomic mRNA synthesis, genome replication, and possibly other processes crucial to the viral life cycle (8van Dinten L.C. van Tol H. Gorbalenya A.E. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5213-5223Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 9van Marle G. van Dinten L.C. Spaan W.J. Luytjes W. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5274-5281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Seybert A. van Dinten L.C. Snijder E.J. Ziebuhr J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9586-9593Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although there are differences in the primary sequence between the EAV MBD and those from HCoV and SARS-CoV, these MBDs are most likely zinc finger domains (29Laity J.H. Lee B.M. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) sharing a common role (8van Dinten L.C. van Tol H. Gorbalenya A.E. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5213-5223Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It remains unclear how the putative zinc finger and helicase domains of the SARS-CoV nsP10 are functionally related to one another and to the general viral life cycle. We report here the expression, purification, and biochemical characterization of the predicted NTPase/helicase domain (nsP10) of the replicase polyprotein (pp1ab) from SARS-CoV. We demonstrate that the nsp10 protein is a functional helicase, which specifically unwinds polynucleotide duplexes with a 5′ to 3′ polarity, placing it in a distinct class of 5′ to 3′ RNA viral helicases within SF-1. The sensitive, high throughput phosphate-release assay that we have used here may be easily adapted to screen libraries of known antiviral compounds for their SARS-CoV helicase/NTPase inhibitory properties. Taken together, our experiments provide the first quantitative analysis of NTPase activity and selectivity in polynucleotide binding for a nidovirus helicase, providing invaluable insight into the biochemical properties of this key SARS-CoV protein. This study presents both an opportunity and a challenge for the future development of helicase-targeted anti-SARS drugs. Addendum—During the process of publication, work in another group also showed the helicase activity of the SARS coronavirus NTPase/helicase (30Thiel V. Ivanov K.A. Putics A. Hertzig T. Schelle B. Bayer S. Weissbrich B. Snijder E.J. Rabenau H. Doerr H.W. Gorbalenya A.E. Ziebuhr J. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 2305-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The protein was expressed as a maltose-binding protein fusion and shown to have both ATPase activity and DNA duplex-unwinding activity; both activities were abolished when the conserved lysine residue in the Walker A box was replaced with alanine.

We previously identified several fully human neutralizing anti-VEGF receptor 2 (or kinase inserting domain-containing receptor (KDR)) antibodies from a large antibody phage display library. These antibodies bind specifically to KDR, block VEGF/KDR interaction, and inhibit VEGF-induced proliferation of human endothelial cells and migration of KDR+ leukemia cells. Three of these antibodies, interestingly, share an identical heavy chain variable (VH) sequence. In this report, we constructed a new library comprising the single VH paired with the variable light chain (VL) repertoire obtained from the original naïve human library. Initial in vitro selection revealed that the single VH could pair with a number of different VL while retaining its specificity for KDR. However, a consensus VH/VL pair, clone 1121, was identified after three or four rounds of selection by tailoring the stringency of the panning conditions. Clone 1121 showed a >30-fold higher binding affinity to KDR (Kd , 100 pm) because of improvement on both association and dissociation constants and blocked VEGF/KDR interaction with an IC50 of ∼1 nm, compared with that of 3–4 nm for the parent Fab fragments. Further, clone 1121 was more potent in inhibiting VEGF-stimulated KDR phosphorylation in endothelial cells. A binding epitope mapping study on clone 1121 and one of the parent clones, 2C6, demonstrated that both antibodies interacted with the third immunoglobulin domain within the extracellular region of KDR. Several peptide phage display libraries were utilized to further examine the fine binding specificities of the two antibodies. All of the 2C6-binding peptides are cysteine-constrained, whereas clone 1121 binds to both cysteine-constrained and linear peptides. It is noteworthy that most of the 2C6-binding peptides also cross-react with clone 1121, but none of the clone 1121-specific peptides binds to 2C6, indicating that clone 1121 retained part of the original binding epitope(s) of 2C6 while gaining new binding specificity. Taken together, our observation suggests that clone 1121 may have great clinical potential in anti-angiogenesis therapy. It further underscores the efforts to identify antibodies of high affinity for enhanced biological activities.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3118) Google Scholar). VEGF, the primary endothelial-specific mitogen, exerts its effects via two high affinity tyrosine kinase receptor, VEGFR1 (or fms-like tyrosine kinase, Flt-1), and VEGFR2 (or kinase insert domain-containing receptor, KDR) (1Ferrara N. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 527-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 2Klagsbrum M. D'Amore P.A.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3118) Google Scholar). Among these two receptors, KDR appears to be the major transducer of VEGF signals in endothelial cells that result in cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, tube formation, increase of vascular permeability, and maintenance of vascular integrity (3Neufeld G.

Inhibition of KDR-mediated signal transduction, therefore, represents an excellent approach for anti-angiogenic intervention. In fact, inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor inhibition has been achieved by using agents that either interrupt VEGF/KDR interaction and/or block the KDR signal transduction pathway (4Margolin K.

In this report, we constructed a new library comprising the single VH paired with the light chain variable (VL) repertoire obtained from the original phage library and, together with a tailored stringent in vitro selection process, identified a consensus VH/VL pair with ∼30-fold affinity improvement. The high affinity variant was more potent in blocking KDR/VEGF interaction and in inhibiting VEGF-stimulated receptor activation. Epitope mapping studies using peptide phage display libraries revealed that the high affinity variant gained novel epitope(s) on KDR while retaining part of the original epitope(s) to which the parent antibodies interact.

Jimenez X. Zhang H. Bohlen P. Witte L. Zhu Z. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). All of the peptide phage display libraries and the Escherichia coli strain K91 were kind gifts from Dr. G. P. Smith of University of Missouri-Columbia (for details see www.biosci.missouri.edu/smithgp/PhageDisplayWebsite/PhageDisplayWebsiteIndex.html). Generation of the Light Chain-shuffled Phage Display Library—The original human Fab phage display library (28De Haard H.J. va Neer N. Reurs A. Hufton S.E. Roovers R.C. Henderikx P. de Bruine A.P. Arends J.-W. Hoogenboom H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18218-18230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), from which the antiKDR antibodies 2C6, 1H4, and 2H2 were identified, was used as the source of the VL repertoire in the shuffled library. The phagemid preparation from the original library was first digested with SfiI and NotI followed by electrophoresis on an agarose gel to separate the VH gene fragments from the antibody light chain-containing backbone vector to delete the entire VH repertoire. The gene encoding the VH domain of clone 2C6/1H4/2H2 was generated by digestion of 2C6-coding phagemid with the same restriction enzymes and purified as described above. The 2C6 VH-coding gene was then ligated into the purified backbone vector to create the VL-shuffled Fab repertoire. E. coli TG1 cells were transformed with the ligation mixtures via electroporation (Electro Cell Manipulator 600, BTX Electroporation System, San Diego, CA). The transformed TG1 cells were growth with shaking in 2YT medium at 37 °C for 60 min and plated onto several 150-mm 2YT agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose (2YTAG plates). After incubation overnight at 30 °C, all of the colonies grown on the plates were scraped into 5 ml of 2YTAG medium, mixed with 1.2 ml of 50% glycerol (final concentration, 10%), aliquoted, and stored at –70 °C as the library stock. Selection of the VL-shuffled Library against KDR—The library stock (100 μl) was grown to log phase in 20 ml of 2YTAG medium, rescued with M13K07 helper phage, and amplified overnight in 2YTAK medium (2YT containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin and 50 μg/ml of kanamycin) at 30 °C. The phage preparation was precipitated in 4% PEG, 0.5 m NaCl, resuspended in 1 ml of 3% fat-free milk/PBS containing 500 μg/ml of AP protein and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to block nonspecific binding. For first round selection, KDR-AP-coated Maxisorp Star tubes (Nunc, Rosklide, Denmark) were first blocked with 3% milk/PBS at 37 °C for 1 h and then incubated with the phage preparation at room temperature for 1 h. The tubes were washed 15 times with PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) followed by 15 washes with PBS. The bound phage was eluted at room temperature for 10 min with 1 ml of a freshly prepared solution of 100 mm triethylamine (Sigma). The eluted phage were incubated with 10 ml of mid-log phase TG1 cells at 37 °C for 30 min stationary and 30 min shaking. The infected TG1 cells were pelleted, plated onto several large 2YTAG plates, and incubated overnight at 30 °C. All of the colonies grown on the plates were scraped into 3–5 ml of 2YTA medium, mixed with glycerol (final concentration: 10%), aliquoted, and stored at –70 °C. For subsequent rounds of selection, 100 μl of the phage stock was added to 20 ml of 2YTAG medium and grown to mid-log phase. The culture was rescued with M13K07 helper phage and amplified overnight in 2YTAK medium, and phage-containing supernatant was used directly (without PEG precipitation) for selection followed the procedure described above, with conditions of various stringency as described in Table I.Table ISelection and identification of anti-KDR antibodies from the VL-shuffled library under various conditions Phage-based KDR Binding and Blocking ELISA—Individual TG1 clones recovered after each round of selection were randomly picked and grown at 37 °C in 96-well plates and rescued with M13K07 helper phage as described above. The amplified phage preparation was blocked with ⅙ volume of 18% milk/PBS at room temperature for 1 h and added to Maxi-sorp 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc) coated with KDR-AP or AP (1 μg/ml × 100 μl at 4 °C overnight). After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the plates were washed three times with PBST and incubated with a mouse anti-M13 phage-HRP conjugate (Amersham Biosciences). The plates were washed five times, TMB peroxidase substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) was added, and the absorbance at 450 nm was read using a microplate reader (Molecular Device, Sunnyvale, CA). For KDR/VEGF blocking ELISA, 100 μl of the blocked phage were mixed with 100 ng of KDR-AP and incubated at room temperature for 1 h, after which the mixture were transferred to 96-well plates coated with VEGF (200 ng/well) at incubated for additional 2 h. The plates were washed five times with PBST, and the substrate for AP (p-nitrophenyl phosphate; Sigma) was added, followed by reading the absorbance at 405 nm to quantify the bound KDR-AP molecules (10Zhu Z. Rockwell P. Lu D. Kotanides H. Pytowski B. Hicklin D.J. Bohlen P. Witte L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3209-3214PubMed Google Scholar) DNA Pattern Analysis and Nucleotide Sequencing—The diversity of the VL-shuffled library and the anti-KDR Fab clones recovered after each round of selection was analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion patterns (i.e. DNA fingerprints) using a frequent cutting enzyme, BstNI (10Zhu Z. Rockwell P. Lu D. Kotanides H. Pytowski B. Hicklin D.J. Bohlen P. Witte L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3209-3214PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lu D. Jimenez X. Zhang H. Bohlen P. Witte L. Zhu Z. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). DNA sequences of representative clones from each digestion pattern were determined by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Classification and alignments of the VH and the VL genes were performed using NCBI IgBlast (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast) and V base (www.mrc-cpe.cam.ac.uk). Expression and Purification of the Soluble Fab Fragments and the Full-length IgG—Phagemids of the individual selected clones were used to transform a nonsuppressor E. coli host HB2151. Expression of the Fab fragments in HB2151 and purification of the soluble Fab proteins from the periplasmic extracts of the E. coli were carried out as previously described (10Zhu Z. Rockwell P. Lu D. Kotanides H. Pytowski B. Hicklin D.J. Bohlen P. Witte L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3209-3214PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lu D. Jimenez X. Zhang H. Bohlen P. Witte L. Zhu Z. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The IgG1 forms of clones 2C6, 1H4, and 1121 (IMC-2C6, IMC-1H4, and IMC-1121, respectively) were constructed and produced in NS0 cells under serum-free conditions following procedures previously described (11Zhu Z. Hattori K. Zhang H. Jimenez X. Ludwig D.L. Dias S. Kussie P. Koo H. Kim H.J. Lu D. Liu M. Tejada R. Friedrich M. Bohlen P. Witte L. Rafii S. Leukemia. 2003; 17: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Quantitative KDR Binding and Blocking Assay—In the direct binding assay, various amounts of anti-KDR antibodies were added to KDR-coated 96-well Maxi-sorp microtiter plates and incubated at room temperature for 1 h, after which the plates were washed three times with PBST. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 100 μl of a rabbit anti-human Fab antibody-HRP conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory Inc., West Grove, PA). The plates were washed and developed, and the absorbance at 450 nm was read following the procedure described above for the phage ELISA. In the competitive KDR/VEGF blocking assay, various amounts of anti-KDR antibodies were mixed with a fixed amount of KDR-AP (100 ng) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The mixture were then transferred to 96-well microtiter plates precoated with VEGF165 (200 ng/well) and incubated at room temperature for an additional 2 h, after which the plates were washed five times, and the substrate for AP was added, followed by reading the absorbance at 405 nm to quantify the bound KDR-AP molecules (10Zhu Z. Rockwell P. Lu D. Kotanides H. Pytowski B. Hicklin D.J. Bohlen P. Witte L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3209-3214PubMed Google Scholar). IC50, i.e. the antibody concentration required for 50% inhibition of KDR binding to VEGF, was then calculated. Antibody Affinity Determination by BIAcore Analysis—The binding kinetics of various antibodies to KDR was measured using a BIAcore 3000 biosensor and evaluated using the program BIA Evaluation 2.0 (Biacore, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). The affinity constant, Kd , was calculated from the ratio of dissociation rate (k off)/association rate (k on) (10Zhu Z. Rockwell P. Lu D. Kotanides H. Pytowski B. Hicklin D.J. Bohlen P. Witte L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3209-3214PubMed Google Scholar). KDR Phosphorylation Assay—The assay was carried out on both HUVEC and PAE-KDR cells following a protocol previously described (10Zhu Z. Rockwell P. Lu D. Kotanides H. Pytowski B. Hicklin D.J. Bohlen P. Witte L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3209-3214PubMed Google Scholar, 22Zhu Z. Lu D. Kotanides H. Santiago A. Jimenez X. Simcox T. Hicklin D.J. Bohlen P. Witte L. Cancer Lett. 1999; 136: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, the serum-starved cells were incubated with various amounts of antibodies at room temperature for 30 min, followed by stimulation with 20 ng/ml of VEGF165 for additional 15 min. The cells were lysed, and KDR protein was precipitated from the cell lysates with a polyclonal anti-KDR antibody (ImClone Systems) followed by protein A-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The proteins were resolved with SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting analysis using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody-HRP conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The signals were detected using enhanced chemoilluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Antibody Epitope Mapping Using KDR Ig Domain Deletion Variants—Full-length KDR (KDR(Ig1–7)) and KDR Ig domain deletion variants, including KDR(Ig1–3) and KDR (Ig3), the deletion variants that contain KDR ECD N-terminal Ig domains 1–3 and 3 only, respectively, were first immobilized onto a 96-well plate (Nunc). The plate was then incubated with various anti-KDR antibodies at room temperature for 1 h, followed by incubation with a mouse anti-human Fc-HRP conjugate (for IMC-1C11, IMC-2C6, and IMC-1121) or a rat anti-mouse Fc-HRP conjugate (for MAB664 only). The plate was washed and developed as described above. Antibody Epitope Mapping Using Peptide Phage Display Libraries—A total of eight randomized pVIII phage-displayed peptide libraries were used to dissect out the fine binding specificities of IMC-2C6 and IMC-1121, including a linear 15-mer library and 7 cysteine-constrained 15-mer libraries with the configuration of -Xn CX 0–6CXn - (n = 3–7). Two parallel selections were carried out using either the single 15-mer linear peptide library or the mixture of all of the 7 cysteine-constrained peptide libraries. Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates were coated with 600 ng of IMC-2C6 or IMC-1121 in 150 μl of PBS overnight and blocked with 3% (w/v) skim milk/PBS at 37 °C for 1 h. The peptide-phage library preparation (∼1–2 × 1011 transforming units in 100 μl of PBS) were mixed with 50 μl of 9% milk/PBS, added into the antibody-coated wells, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. A nonspecific human IgG was added in the solution (1 mg/ml) to absorb IgG Fc-binding phages. The plate was washed 15 times with PBS/Tween 20 (0.1%), and the bound phages were eluted by incubation with 150 μl of HCl with bovine serum albumin (0.1 m HCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, adjusted to pH 2.2 with glycine) at room temperature for 10 min, followed by neutralization with 25 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). Recovered phages were then rescued by infecting 75 μl of mid-log phase E. coli K91 cells at room temperature for 15 min, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 45 min. The infected cells were amplified in 4 ml of 2YT/tet (tetracycline at 40 μg/ml) medium at 37 °C overnight, followed by PEG precipitation and resuspension in PBS for the subsequent round of selection. For the second and third round selections, 300 and 150 ng, respectively, of antibodies were used to coat the microwells of the 96-well plate. Identification of Antibody-binding Peptide Phages—ELISA was used to identify peptide phage clones that bind to IMC-2C6 or IMC-1121 after three rounds of selection. Individual phage clones were inoculated in 200 μl of 2YT/tet/isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) in 96-well plates and grown at 37 °C overnight. After centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 10 min, the culture supernatants were mixed with ⅓ volume of 9% milk/PBS and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. Aliquots of 50 μl of the mixture were transferred to 96-well plates coated with an anti-M13 phage-antibody (1 μg/ml) and incubated at room temperature for 60 min to capture the phage particles on the plate. IMC-2C6 or IMC-1121 antibody were added to the plate at 1 μg/ml, and the amounts of bound antibodies were detected by an anti-human Fc antibody-HRP conjugate as described. A total of two to three dozen positive clones were randomly picked and subjected to DNA sequencing using the primer 5′-CCTGTTGACAATTAATCATCGGCTC-3′. Dose-dependent Antibody Binding and Blocking Assays—To produce phage preparations for quantitative binding and blocking assays, individual selected clones were inoculated into 5 ml of 2YT/tet and incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 5 h. The cell cultures were then transferr"

(2002) Science 298, 1781–1785). In this study, we investigated whether accumulation of prion protein (PrP) in the cytosol is toxic to human neurons in primary culture. We show that in these neurons, a single PrP isoform lacking signal peptide accumulates in the cytosol of neurons treated with epoxomicin, a specific proteasome inhibitor. Therefore, endogenously expressed PrP is subject to the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway and is degraded by the proteasome in human primary neurons. In contrast to its toxicity in N2a cells, reverse-translocated PrP (ERAD-PrP) is not toxic even when neurons are microinjected with cDNA constructs to overexpress either wild-type PrP or mutant PrPD178N. We found that ERAD-PrP in human neurons remains detergentsoluble and proteinase K-sensitive, in contrast to its detergent-insoluble and proteinase K-resistant state in N2a cells. Furthermore, not only is microinjection of a cDNA construct expressing CyPrP not toxic, it protects these neurons against Bax-mediated cell death. We conclude that in human neurons, ERAD-PrP is not converted naturally into a form reminiscent of scrapie PrP and that PrP located in the cytosol retains its protective function against Bax. Thus, it is unlikely that simple accumulation of PrP in the cytosol can cause neurodegeneration in prion diseases. Recently, it was observed that reverse-translocated cytosolic PrP and PrP expressed in the cytosol induce rapid death in neurons (Ma, J., Wollmann, R., and Lindquist, S.

The prion protein (PrP) 1The abbreviations used are: PrP, prion protein; ERAD, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradative pathway; ERAD-PrP, PrP derived from the ERAD and retro-translocated in the cytosol; SP-PrP, PrP containing the N-terminal signal peptide; PrPSc, PrP scrapie; CyPrP, cytosolic form of PrP (residues 23–231); EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; DTR, dextran Texas Red; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; BFA, brefeldin A; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; wtPrP, wild-type PrP. is mostly expressed as a secreted glycoprotein that remains attached to the cell surface through a glycophosphatidylinositol anchor. On occasion, PrP also accumulates as a transmembrane type I or type II glycoprotein (1Yost C.S. Lopez C.D. Prusiner S.B. Myers R.M. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1990; 343: 669-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Furthermore, wild-type and mutant PrPs, Y145stop and Q217R, respectively, generate intracellular PrP in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, indicating that the normally secreted PrP is subject to the degradative pathway termed endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation (ERAD), possibly to eliminate misfolded PrP molecules (2Zanusso G.

A. 2001; 98: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This form of PrP is termed ERAD-PrP. However, immunodetection of PrP with an intact N-terminal signal peptide in transfected cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor raises the possibility that a fraction of the overexpressed PrP (SP-PrP) is synthesized in the cytosol instead of going through the secretory pathway (6Drisaldi B. Stewart R.S. Adles C. Stewart L.R. Quaglio E. Biasini E. Fioriti L. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21732-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The presence of PrP in the cytosol (ERAD-PrP or SP-PrP) suggests that deregulation of the proteasome during aging could result in the accumulation of cytotoxic PrP molecules (7Keller J.N. Gee J. Ding Q. Ageing Res. Rev. 2002; 1: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Indeed, PrP that accumulates in the cytosol of mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and African green monkey kidney COS-1 cells forms insoluble aggregates partially resistant to proteinase K, which is reminiscent of PrP scrapie (PrPSc) (4Yedidia Y. Horonchik L. Tzaban S. Yanai A. Taraboulos A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5383-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 5Ma J. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, accumulation of PrP in the presence of proteasome inhibitors is toxic to N2a cells but not to COS-1 or Swiss mouse embryo NIH3T3 fibroblasts, suggesting that cytosolic PrP is toxic only to neuronal cell types (9Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In vivo, expression of a transgene encoding a form of PrP that lacks both the N- and C-terminal signal peptides and is exclusively expressed in the cytosol (CyPrP) induces a massive loss of granule cerebellar neurons and gliosis (9Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Because CyPrP is expressed at a very low level in the transgenic model, it is assumed that CyPrP is a very toxic isoform that is responsible for the initiation of neurodegeneration in prion diseases and that it contributes to the production of the protease-resistant PrPSc (9Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Because of the importance of these findings on the development of prion diseases, we studied the effect of PrP accumulation in the cytosol of human primary neurons. Human neurons are a more appropriate model to address the toxicity of PrP in relation to prion diseases in human, as they may behave differently than cell lines because they are terminally differentiated, polarized, and have a very long life span. We show that in human primary neurons, endogenously expressed PrP accumulates in the cytosol when cells are treated with epoxomicin, a specific irreversible inhibitor of the proteasome. The protein does not possess an N-terminal signal peptide and is, therefore, likely to arise from the ERAD pathway. However, in contrast to N2a cells, ERAD-PrP in the cytosol of human neurons remains proteinase K-sensitive and detergent-soluble and is not toxic. Moreover, overexpression of WtPrP, PrPD178N, or CyPrP from microinjected cDNA constructs is not toxic in human neurons, nor is CyPrP expression toxic in two human neuroblastoma cell lines, BE(2)-M17 and SK-N-SH, treated with epoxomicin. In addition, we demonstrate that CyPrP expression protects human neurons against Bax-mediated cell death, similar to what we previously observed with WtPrP (10Bounhar Y. Zhang Y. Goodyer C.G. LeBlanc A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39145-39149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We conclude that accumulation of PrP in the cytosol of neurons is not sufficient for neurotoxicity. Clones—Cloning of human PrP, PrP-D178N, and Bax in pCEP4β (Invitrogen) was described previously (10Bounhar Y. Zhang Y. Goodyer C.G. LeBlanc A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39145-39149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). CyPrP (residues 23–231) was PCR-amplified using forward primer 5′-ataagaatgcggccgcatgaagaagcgcccgaagcctggag-3′ and reverse primer 5′-cgcggatcctcacatgctcgatcctctctggtaatag-3′ and cloned between the NotI and BamHI sites of pCE-P4β. The pCEP4β-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-Bax construct was obtained by PCR amplification of Bax with 5′-ccgctcgagtggacgggtccggggagcagc-3′ and 5′-cccaagctttcagcccatcttcttccacatcc-3′, and the PCR product was cloned in the XhoI/HindIII sites of pCEP4β-EGFP. pCEP4β-EGFP was created by transferring EGFP from EGFP-C1 (Clontech) into the NheI/BamHI restriction sites of pCEP4β. Cell Culture, Microinjections, Transfection, and Cell Death—Human primary neurons were cultured as described (11LeBlanc A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7837-7846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microinjections and cell death determination were described previously (12Zhang Y. LeBlanc A. Boulton A.A. Baker G.B. Apoptosis Techniques and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 83-106Google Scholar). Briefly, neurons were microinjected with 25 pl containing 0.75 pg of DNA and 2.5 pg of dextran Texas Red (DTR) in phosphate-buffered saline. Two hundred neurons from at least three independent neuronal preparations were injected. Cells were fixed in 4% sucrose and 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline; cell death was assessed by TUNEL according to the manufacturer's protocol (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (A,P), Roche Applied Science). The percentage of cell death was determined as the number of DTR and TUNEL double-positive over the total number of DTR-positive neurons. All cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Human neuroblastoma cells BE(2)-M17 and SK-N-SH were maintained in OptiMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum and minimum essential medium plus 5% bovine calf serum, respectively (Invitrogen). N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Transfections were carried out in 6-well plates using ExGen 500 and 4 μg of DNA according to the manufacturer's protocol (MBI, Burlington, Ontario, Canada). For detection of SP-PrP, BE(2)-M17 cells were transfected with 10 μg of DNA, as described previously (6Drisaldi B. Stewart R.S. Adles C. Stewart L.R. Quaglio E. Biasini E. Fioriti L. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21732-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Nuclei were visualized after staining 20 min with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) 24 h after transfection. Subcellular Fractionation and PrP Detection—Subcellular fractions were prepared as described previously (13Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) with some modification. Approximately 72 × 106 cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer and homogenized with 20 strokes in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (homogenization buffer: 8% sucrose (w/v), 20 mm HCl-Tricine, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA). After a first spin at 2000 × g for 10 min to eliminate unbroken cells and nuclei, the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatant and pellet from the 100,000 × g centrifugation represent the cytosolic and membrane fractions, respectively. Proteins of each fraction were solubilized in loading buffer (0.5% SDS (w/v), 1.25% 2-β-mercaptoethanol (v/v), 4% glycerol (v/v), 0.01% bromphenol blue (w/v), 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), and 100 μg of protein was separated in a 15% SDS-PAGE. PrP was detected by Western blotting using the 3F4 monoclonal antibody (1: 5000 dilution) and an antibody directed against PrP N-terminal signal peptide (anti SP-PrP, 1:1000 dilution, kindly provided by Dr. D. A. Harris, Washington University School of Medicine). For Bcl2 and tau detection, a polyclonal N19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and a monoclonal T-5530 antibody (Sigma) were used, respectively. Analysis of PrP Aggregation and Proteinase K Digestion—Culture media were replaced with media containing 5 μg/ml brefeldin A (Sigma) and either 0.25 μm (cell lines) or 1 μm (neurons) epoxomicin (BioMol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) 24 h after transfection. After 16 h of treatment, cells in 6-well plates were lysed with 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 (v/v), and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (w/v)) for 20 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, soluble PrP was present in the supernatant and aggregated PrP was present in the pellet. Proteins from the pellet were resuspended in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer. Proteins in both supernatants and pellets were precipitated with 4 volumes of methanol and analyzed by Western blotting. Resistance to proteinase K was assessed by incubating cell lysates with 10 μg/ml proteinase K for 30 min at 37 °C. Statistical Evaluation—The significance of variance was analyzed with analysis of variance followed by post-hoc Scheffé's test using StatView (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). A p < 0.05 was taken as a significant difference. To assess whether PrP is subject to the ERAD pathway in human neurons, we treated cells with both brefeldin A (BFA) and epoxomicin. BFA blocks the transport of secreted proteins beyond the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-cis-Golgi compartment (14Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is expected to increase the amount of PrP diverted to the ERAD. Epoxomicin is a specific and irreversible inhibitor of the proteasome (15Meng L. Mohan R. Kwok B.H. Elofsson M. Sin N. Crews C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10403-10408Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar) and is expected to allow PrP accumulation in the cytosol. Cells were homogenized, and the presence of PrP was analyzed by Western blotting of proteins from crude extracts, cytosol, and membrane subcellular fractions (Fig. 1A). In untreated cells, PrP was mainly detected in membranes but not in the cytosol. Treatment of cells with BFA + epoxomicin resulted in the synthesis of immature PrP. Moreover, a large proportion of PrP was present in the cytosol. The presence of Bcl2 in membranes but not in the cytosol and the detection of tau protein isoforms mainly in the cytosol show that relatively pure subcellular fractions were used in this experiment. The apparent molecular mass of PrP in the cytosol was slightly decreased (Fig. 1A). To determine if the signal peptide was removed from PrP, we used an antibody directed against the N-terminal signal peptide of PrP (6Drisaldi B. Stewart R.S. Adles C. Stewart L.R. Quaglio E. Biasini E. Fioriti L. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21732-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The SP-PrP antibody did not detect PrP in the cytosol, suggesting the form of PrP that accumulated in the presence of epoxomicin and BFA was indeed reverse-translocated. Interestingly, no SP-PrP was detected in the crude lysate of neurons. Therefore, either the signal peptide was efficiently removed from endogenously expressed PrP protein, or the amount of SP-PrP was below the limit of detection. The specificity of the SP-PrP antibody was verified in BE(2)-M17 cells transfected with 10 μg of WtPrP cDNA (Fig. 1B), as described previously (6Drisaldi B. Stewart R.S. Adles C. Stewart L.R. Quaglio E. Biasini E. Fioriti L. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21732-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The antibody detects a form of PrP that contains the SP in WtPrP-transfected BE(2)-M17 cells. In contrast, neither fractionated cytosolic PrP nor PrP in crude extracts from control or BFA + epoxomycin-treated human neurons were detected with the SP-antibody. The expression of PrP was verified by reprobing the blot with the 3F4 antibody (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the presence of ERAD-PrP in the cytosol of human neurons is as toxic as it is in neuroblastoma N2a cells (9Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), cell death in untreated or BFA + epoxomicin-treated neurons was assessed by TUNEL assay. Accumulation of PrP in the cytosol does not induce cell death (Fig. 1C, Ctl). To test whether toxicity may occur only in conditions of overexpression of PrP, neurons were microinjected with a WtPrP cDNA high expression construct before the incubation with BFA + epoxomicin. Again, no toxicity was observed (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, microinjection of a construct expressing mutant D178NPrP known to enhance PrP trafficking through the ERAD pathway (5Ma J. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) also does not induce toxicity. However, neurons remain sensitive to Bax overexpression in the absence or presence of BFA + epoxomicin. To address more precisely the cytotoxicity of PrP in the cytosol of human neurons, a cytosolic form of PrP (CyPrP, amino acids 23–231) that contains neither the N-terminal ER-targeting peptide nor the C-terminal signal peptide required for the addition of a glycophosphatidylinositol anchor was cloned. This construct expressed stable levels of CyPrP in neuroblastoma BE(2)-M17 cells that lack endogenous PrP expression (Fig. 1D, inset). Microinjection of CyPrP cDNA did not induce neuronal cell death even 72 h after injection (Fig. 1D). In contrast, N2a cells are susceptible to CyPrP expression within 24 h of transfection, as shown by Ma, Wollmann, and Lindquist (9Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). Moreover, attempts to select stable N2a cells expressing CyPrP failed (not shown). This finding prompted us to test the cytotoxicity of CyPrP in other human neuroblastoma cell lines. In contrast to what we observed in N2a murine neuroblastoma cells, expression of CyPrP was toxic to neither BE(2)-M17 nor SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 1E). These cells are all competent to undergo apoptosis, as verified by overexpression of Bax. Therefore, not all neuronal cells are susceptible to CyPrP-mediated toxicity. When it accumulates in the cytosol of N2a cells, ERAD-PrP/SP-PrP is converted to a detergent-insoluble and proteinase K-resistant form reminiscent of the transmissible PrPSc (8Ma J. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1785-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the detergent solubility and proteinase K resistance of PrP in primary neurons or transiently transfected N2a, BE(2)-M17, or SK-N-SH cell lines in the absence and presence of BFA + epoxomicin (Fig. 2). In the absence of BFA + epoxomicin, PrP is completely detergent soluble in all cell types. However, in the presence of BFA + epoxomicin, a small amount of PrP resisted detergent solubility in N2a cells but not in primary neurons and BE(2)-M17 or SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 2A). Similarly, PrP became partially resistant to proteinase K in N2a but not in primary neurons and BE(2)-M17 or SK-N-SH cells treated with BFA + epoxomicin (Fig. 2B). These results show that the conversion of ERAD-PrP does not occur significantly in human primary neurons or neuroblastoma cell lines. To assess whether CyPrP retains its neuroprotective function against Bax in human neurons, we co-microinjected a Bax-expressing construct with CyPrP. Microinjection of Bax cDNA killed about 45% of neurons within 24 h (Fig. 3A). As observed previously, co-expression of WtPrP completely protects against Bax-mediated cell death. Co-injection of CyPrP cDNA also protects against Bax-mediated cell death. To ensure that WtPrP and CyPrP do not inhibit Bax expression, an EGFP-Bax fusion protein cDNA previously shown to behave like WtBax (16Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar) was cloned and microinjected with WtPrP or CyPrP constructs. In the absence of WtPrP and CyPrP co-injection, EGFP was detected in only 25 of the 100 cells injected, indicating that the fusion Bax-EGFP protein may be very toxic and that dying neurons either degrade EGFP-Bax more efficiently or have a lower synthesis rate (Fig. 3B). However, in the presence of WtPrP or CyPrP, 70–80 of 100 cells injected showed EGFP fluorescence, indicating that WtPrP or CyPrP do not inhibit Bax expression but inhibit Bax-mediated cell death. Therefore, not only is expression of PrP in the cytosol not toxic in human neurons, but it also protects against Bax-mediated cytotoxicity. In this paper, we show that endogenously expressed PrP is subject to the ERAD pathway in human primary neurons and that ERAD-PrP does not convert into a PrPSc-like state in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor. In the cytosol, neither ERAD-PrP nor transfected CyPrP is toxic. Moreover, CyPrP inhibits Bax-mediated cell death. PrP Goes through the ERAD Pathway in Human Neurons— Here, we show conclusively that endogenously expressed PrP goes through the ERAD pathway in primary human neurons. Previous studies used immunofluorescence in transfected Chinese hamster ovary, COS, N2a, NIH3T3, and undifferentiated rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell lines to detect PrP in the cytosol of cells treated with proteasome inhibitors (4Yedidia Y. Horonchik L. Tzaban S. Yanai A. Taraboulos A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5383-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 5Ma J. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 6Drisaldi B. Stewart R.S. Adles C. Stewart L.R. Quaglio E. Biasini E. Fioriti L. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21732-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). However, immunofluorescence experiments cannot exclude the possibility that PrP is associated with cytoplasmic structures or organelles. Our observation (obtained by subcellular fractionation) that PrP is detected in the cytosol strongly supports the presence of soluble cytosolic PrP in human neurons. Moreover, expression of PrP under the control of a strong promoter such as cytomegalovirus might artificially produce PrP molecules bearing the N-terminal signal peptide (SP-PrP) that accumulate in the presence of proteasome inhibitors (6Drisaldi B. Stewart R.S. Adles C. Stewart L.R. Quaglio E. Biasini E. Fioriti L. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21732-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In human neurons, ERAD-PrP is made from endogenously expressed PrP, and the N-terminal signal peptide is removed from the protein because an antibody directed against this peptide does not detect PrP in the cytosol of cells treated with epoxomicin. ERAD-PrP is detected in a purified cytosolic fraction but not in a crude extract, indicating that the protein is present at a relatively low level. The shift in molecular weight of ERAD-PrP implies that the molecule has lost its immature glycosylation, as expected in a retro-translocated protein. These results indicate that prior to proteasomal degradation, PrP is first translocated into the ER where the signal peptides are cleaved and immature glycosylation occurs. Then, after undergoing deglycosylation, PrP can be reverse-translocated into the cytosol, leading to the appearance of ERAD-PrP. Conversion of Cytosolically Located PrP into a PrPSc-like Isoform Is Limited to Certain Neuronal Cell Types—When ERAD-PrP/SP-PrP accumulates in the cytosol of N2a cells, it converts into a form reminiscent of PrPSc and is toxic (Ref. 8Ma J. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1785-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar and this study). Therefore, it was important to determine the state and the toxicity of ERAD-PrP in human neurons. Here, we show evidence that in human primary neurons and in two human neuroblastoma cell lines, BE(2)-M17 and SK-N-SH, ERAD-PrP does not convert into a PrPSc-like form. Several hypotheses could explain why ERAD-PrP conversion seems to be cell type-dependent. First, overexpression of PrP in transfected cells may induce PrP aggregation and resistance to proteinase K. Overexpression-induced protein aggregation in transfected cells has already been reported for α-synuclein (involved in Parkinson's disease) (18McLean P.J. Kawamata H. Hyman B.T. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 901-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and tau (involved in tauopathies in transfected cells) (17Hall G.F. Lee V.M. Lee G. Yao J. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As mentioned by Drisaldi et al. (6Drisaldi B. Stewart R.S. Adles C. Stewart L.R. Quaglio E. Biasini E. Fioriti L. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21732-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), proteasome inhibitors may cause a significant increase in PrP expression from the cytomegalovirus promoter, leading to accumulation of large amounts of PrP in cells. The hypothesis that PrP overexpression leads to PrP aggregation in human neurons is supported because they only express endogenous levels of PrP and there is no PrP conversion. However, SK-N-SH cells consistently accumulate more ERAD-PrP than N2a cells, yet they do not produce detergent-insoluble and proteinase K-resistant PrP (Fig. 2A). Second, intracellular redox conditions could affect conversion of PrP into a PrPSc-like form. We have not tested this hypothesis in human neurons and N2a cells, but evidence obtained in yeast and mammalian cells treated with a reducing agent show that cellular PrP is converted into a detergent-insoluble and proteinase K-resistant form (9Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 19Ma J. Lindquist S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is plausible that the reducing conditions in the cytosol vary in different cell types and affect conversion of PrP. Interestingly, recombinant PrP under reducing conditions also forms insoluble aggregates in vitro (20Maiti N.R. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2427-2431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Third, other cellular parameters such as pH may be involved in PrP conversion. Acidic pH favors PrP conversion in vitro, and some in vivo studies suggest that PrP conversion occurs in intracellular acidic compartments (21Zou W.Q. Cashman N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43942-43947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Prusiner S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16188-16199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Ernst D. Race R.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6597-6603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Swietnicki W. Petersen R. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27517-27520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Interestingly, human neurons maintain stable pH, as evidenced by phenol red pH indicator in culture medium, whereas the pH in the culture medium of N2a cells becomes acidic rapidly. Finally, because ERAD-PrP does not convert into a scrapie-like conformation in all cells, it is possible that some cytosolic factors allow or prevent PrP conversion. Chaperones GroEL, a close homolog of mammalian Hsp60, and Hsp104 promote the conversion of PrP into PrPSc-like protein in vitro (25DebBurman S.K. Raymond G.J. Caughey B. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13938-13943Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 26Edenhofer F. Rieger R. Famulok M. Wendler W. Weiss S. Winnacker E.L. J.

Cytosolically Located PrP Is Not Toxic in All Neuronal Cell Types—Our results show that ERAD-PrP is not toxic to human primary neurons even when WtPrP or mutant PrPD178N, known to increase trafficking through the ERAD pathway, are overexpressed (5Ma J. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Similar to ERAD-PrP, CyPrP is clearly not toxic in human primary neurons or in human neuroblastoma BE(2)-M17 and SK-N-SH cells. Based on the observation that CyPrP is toxic to N2a cells but not to fibroblast-derived NIH3T3 cells, it was suggested that CyPrP toxicity is restricted to neuronal cells (9Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Our results show that CyPrP toxicity is, in fact, restricted to few neuronal cells. This conclusion is consistent with the lack of CyPrP toxicity in neuronal cells other than cerebellar granule neurons in transgenic mice, despite the use of the ubiquitously expressed PrP promoter (9Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that ERAD-PrP toxicity in N2a cells depends on its conversion into a detergent-insoluble and proteinase K-resistant form. To address this question, agents that can prevent ERAD-PrP conversion in N2a cells will need to be uncovered and tested. However, the toxicity of detergent-soluble and proteinase K-sensitive CyPrP in N2a but not NIH3T3 cells and the absence of detectable PrPSc-like CyPrP in the dying cerebellar granule neurons of the transgenic mice argue against this mechanism (9Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). To understand fully why CyPrP or ERAD-PrP is toxic to N2a but not to human neurons or human neuroblastoma cell lines, the underlying mechanism of cell death will have to be elucidated in N2a cells. CyPrP Inhibits Bax-mediated Cell Death—In the present work, we observed that CyPrP is capable of preventing Bax from killing human primary neurons, as we have shown previously with WtPrP (10Bounhar Y. Zhang Y. Goodyer C.G. LeBlanc A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39145-39149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Bax has been shown to be critical in several in vitro and in vivo models of neuronal cell death (28Deckwerth T.L. Elliott J.L. Knudson C.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. Snider W.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 401-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 29Harris C.A. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 39145-39149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Various Bax inhibitors have been identified, some of which (Bax inhibitor-1, humanin, and Ku70) interact directly with Bax (31Guo B. Zhai D. Cabezas E. Welsh K. Nouraini S. Satterthwait A.C. Reed J.C. Nature. 2003; 423: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 32Sawada M. Sun W. Hayes P. Leskov K. Boothman D.A. Matsuyama S. Nat. Cell.

PrP should also be considered as a Bax inhibitor. Previously, several studies have reported the neuroprotective effect of PrP (34Kuwahara C. Takeuchi A.M. Nishimura T. Haraguchi K. Kubosaki A.

In some instance, PrP induces neuroprotective signals through the plasma membrane (37Chen S. Mange A. Dong L. Lehmann S. Schachner M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 22: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 38Zanata S.M. Lopes M.H. Mercadante A.F. Hajj G.N. Chiarini L.B. Nomizo R. Freitas A.R. Cabral A.L. Lee K.S.

However, the observations that WtPrP goes through the ERAD pathway (2Zanusso G. Petersen R.B. Jin T. Jing Y. Kanoush R. Ferrari S. Gambetti P. Singh N. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 39145-39149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar and this study), and that four identical N-terminal PrP octapeptide repeats share similarity with the Bcl2 homology domain 2 (39LeBlanc A. Wang S.S. Handbook of the Aging Brain. Academic Press, NY1998: 201-221Crossref Google Scholar) raise the possibility that, in a manner similar to Bcl2, PrP may interact directly with Bax. However, Bax and PrP did not interact in a yeast two-hybrid system experiment (40Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Moreover, PrP is present mainly at the cell surface and in luminal vesicular sites (ER, Golgi, endosomes), whereas only a small proportion is retro-translocated (10% of nascent PrP molecules in a cell culture model) (4Yedidia Y. Horonchik L. Tzaban S. Yanai A. Taraboulos A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5383-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to understand how PrP prevents Bax-mediated cell death. In summary, we have demonstrated that not only is CyPrP not toxic in human primary neurons, it also protects these cells against the major neuronal proapoptotic protein, Bax. Therefore, based on the observation that expression of CyPrP in transgenic mice leads to neurodegeneration, it seems premature to conclude that reverse-translocation of PrP in the cytosol represents a step in the development of prion diseases in humans. This study also highlights the importance of using, in addition to cell lines and animal models, cultured human primary neurons as a cell model of prion diseases. We thank Dr. D. A. Harris (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis) for providing the antibodies directed against the N-terminal signal peptide of PrP."
https://openalex.org/W1974089939,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) exert antagonistic effects on collagen synthesis in human dermal fibroblasts. We have recently shown that Y box-binding protein YB-1 mediates the inhibitory effects of IFN-γ on α2(I) procollagen gene (COL1A2) transcription through the IFN-γ response element located between –161 and –150. Here we report that YB-1 counter-represses TGF-β-stimulated COL1A2 transcription by interfering with Smad3 bound to the upstream sequence around –265 and subsequently by interrupting the Smad3-p300 interaction. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses using inhibitors for Janus kinases or casein kinase II suggested that the casein kinase II-dependent signaling pathway mediates IFN-γ-induced nuclear translocation of YB-1. Down-regulation of endogenous YB-1 expression by double-stranded YB-1-specific RNA abrogated the transcriptional repression of COL1A2 by IFN-γ in the absence and presence of TGF-β. In transient transfection assays, overexpression of YB-1 in human dermal fibroblasts exhibited antagonistic actions against TGF-β and Smad3. Physical interaction between Smad3 and YB-1 was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation-Western blot analyses, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays using the recombinant Smad3 and YB-1 proteins indicated that YB-1 forms a complex with Smad3 bound to the Smad-binding element. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays showed that YB-1 binds to the MH1 domain of Smad3, whereas the central and carboxyl-terminal regions of YB-1 were required for its interaction with Smad3. YB-1 also interferes with the Smad3-p300 interaction by its preferential binding to p300. Altogether, the results provide a novel insight into the mechanism by which IFN-γ/YB-1 counteracts TGF-β/Smad3. They also indicate that IFN-γ/YB-1 inhibits COL1A2 transcription by dual actions: via the IFN-γ response element and through a cross-talk with the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) exert antagonistic effects on collagen synthesis in human dermal fibroblasts. We have recently shown that Y box-binding protein YB-1 mediates the inhibitory effects of IFN-γ on α2(I) procollagen gene (COL1A2) transcription through the IFN-γ response element located between –161 and –150.

Physical interaction between Smad3 and YB-1 was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation-Western blot analyses, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays using the recombinant Smad3 and YB-1 proteins indicated that YB-1 forms a complex with Smad3 bound to the Smad-binding element. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays showed that YB-1 binds to the MH1 domain of Smad3, whereas the central and carboxyl-terminal regions of YB-1 were required for its interaction with Smad3. YB-1 also interferes with the Smad3-p300 interaction by its preferential binding to p300. Altogether, the results provide a novel insight into the mechanism by which IFN-γ/YB-1 counteracts TGF-β/Smad3. They also indicate that IFN-γ/YB-1 inhibits COL1A2 transcription by dual actions: via the IFN-γ response element and through a cross-talk with the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. Regulation of connective tissue metabolism is under rigorous control by growth factors and cytokines, which act in concert to mesenchymal cell recruitment and proliferation, as well as synthesis and degradation of the extracellular matrix components (1Mauviel A. Uitto J. Wounds. 1993; 5: 137-152Google Scholar, 2Mauviel A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Disruption of this equilibrium, leading to excessive collagen deposition, is the common hallmark of interstitial fibrotic diseases in various organs. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms governing the synthesis of type I collagen, the most abundant protein of extracellular matrix components, is essential for understanding not only physiological tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis but also pathological conditions associated with excessive collagen accumulation.Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) 1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; SBE, Smad-binding element; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; Jak, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; IgRE, IFN-γ response element; CK2, casein kinase II; FCS, fetal calf serum; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MHC-II, major histocompatibility complex class II; CIITA, class II transactivator; CBP, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein; CSD, cold shock domain.1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; SBE, Smad-binding element; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; Jak, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; IgRE, IFN-γ response element; CK2, casein kinase II; FCS, fetal calf serum; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MHC-II, major histocompatibility complex class II; CIITA, class II transactivator; CBP, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein; CSD, cold shock domain. is well known to be the principal factor that induces type I collagen gene expression and leads to tissue fibrosis (3Kulozik M.

Recently, a family of proteins, termed Smad, have been identified as intracellular mediators of the signal transduction pathways of TGF-β superfamily members (6Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P.

The critical roles of TGF-β/Smad signaling to stimulate transcription of type I collagen genes in fibroblasts have been supported by the following results: (a) TGF-β treatment initiates the nuclear translocation of receptor Smads (Smad2 and Smad3) and Smad4 (10Mori Y.

Nemoto T. Takehara K. ten Dijke P. Nakao A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), (b) COL1A2 promoter contains a Smad-binding element (SBE) that, together with the adjacent Sp1-binding site, mediates transcriptional up-regulation by TGF-β (12Zhang W.

Furthermore, interaction between Smads and coactivators p300/CBP enhances COL1A2 transcription in dermal fibroblasts (15Ghosh A.K. Yuan W. Mori Y. Varga J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3546-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).The interplay of different signaling pathways is the key to provide cells with an integrated response to total signal inputs. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ), a pleiotropic cytokine produced by T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, is generally antagonistic to TGF-β in the regulation of hematopoietic development and immune cell functions such as inflammation (16Ulloa L. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). The Janus kinase (Jak)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway has been shown to represent the key signal transduction through which IFN-γ regulates gene transcription (17Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). It has recently been suggested that p300/CBP integrates TGF-β-induced Smad and IFN-γ-induced STAT1 signals that positively and negatively regulate collagen gene transcription, respectively (18Ghosh A.K. Yuan W. Mori Y. Chen S.J. Varga J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11041-11048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Involvement of STAT1 in the IFN-γ-elicited inhibition of collagen deposition was also shown in STAT1 knockout mouse fibroblasts (19Eickelberg O. Pansky A. Koehler E. Bihl M. Tamm M. Hildebrand P. Perruchoud A.P. Kashgarian M. Roth M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). On the other hand, several studies have revealed the existence of Jak- or STAT-independent IFN-γ signaling pathways (17Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar, 20Remana C.V. Gill M.P. Han Y. Ransohoff R.M. Schreiber R.D. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 287-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Indeed, several reports have shown that IFN-γ inhibits transcription of collagen genes in human fibroblasts and abrogates the stimulatory effect of TGF-β independent of STAT1-promoter interactions (23Kahari V.M. Chen Y.Q. Su M.W. Ramirez F. Uitto J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 24Yuan W. Yufit T. Li L. Mori Y. Chen S.J. Varga J. J. Cell.

Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).We have previously identified a pyrimidine-rich sequence, entirely different from the IFN-γ activated site, within the human COL1A2 promoter that is critical for transcriptional repression by IFN-γ and designated this region the IFN-γ response element (IgRE) (25Higashi K. Kouba D.J. Song Y.J Uitto J. Mauviel A. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). More recently, we have demonstrated that Y box-binding protein YB-1 binds to the IgRE and mediates IFN-γ-elicited COL1A2 inhibition (26Higashi K. Inagaki Y. Suzuki N. Mitsui S. Mauviel A. Kaneko H. Nakatsuka I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5156-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Norman et al. (27Norman J.T. Lindahl G.E. Shakib K. Nia A.E. Yilmaz E. Mertens P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29880-29890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have reported that YB-1 also binds to the proximal promoter sequence of the coordinately expressed α1(I) collagen gene and suppresses gene transcription. In the present study, a combination of the RNA interference technique and cell transfection assays, showed that YB-1 plays critical roles in mediating transcriptional repression of COL1A2 by IFN-γ through the casein kinase II (CK2)-dependent signaling pathway. We demonstrated the functional and physical interactions between YB-1 and Smad3. YB-1 also binds to p300 and interferes with the Smad3-p300 interaction. These findings provide a novel insight into the control of connective tissue remodeling by TGF-β and IFN-γ in physiologic and pathologic conditions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures, Plasmids, and Reagents—Normal human dermal fibroblasts (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and human embryonic kidney 293 EBNA cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin. Osteosarcoma KHOS-240S cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in minimum essential Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, Earle's salt, nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin. Human COL1A2 promoter sequence spanning from –342 to +58 or four copies of SBE oligonucleotide (GTCTAGAC) linked to a minimal promoter containing only a TATA box was inserted into a firefly luciferase gene vector, pGL3 Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). Smad3 and YB-1 expression vectors were constructed by ligating their coding sequences into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). A FLAG-tagged YB-1 expression plasmid was obtained by subcloning the entire coding sequence into a pcDNA3-FLAG vector. A FLAG-tagged p300 expression vector (28Nishihara A. Hanai J. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28716-28723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and an Sp1 expression plasmid (29Elder G.A. Liang Z. Li C. Lazzarini R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6281-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) were generously provided by Drs. M. Kawabata and G. Elder, respectively. Bacterial expression plasmids were prepared by ligating respective coding sequence into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) or pET28a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI). Jak inhibitors aurintricarboxylic acid and AG490 were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA) and Sigma, respectively, and a CK2 inhibitor, apigenin, was obtained from Calbiochem.Preparation and Transfection of Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)— Twenty-one-base double-stranded RNAs were synthesized and purified by Dharmacon Research Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The siRNA sense sequences used for targeting YB-1 and STAT1 were GGUCAUCGCAACGAAGGUUdTdT and GCUUCUUGGUCCUAACGCCdTdT, respectively. A nonspecific siRNA, scramble (B-Bridge, San Jose, CA), was used as a control. KHOS-240S cells were transfected with 2 μg of siRNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Forty-eight hours later, further transfection with 1 μg of siRNA, and 3 μg of reporter plasmid was carried out. The cells were incubated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) and/or 1 units/ml IFN-γ (Roche Applied Science) in the presence of 2 μg of siRNA for another 36 h. Transfection efficiency of siRNAs was estimated by a Silencer siRNA labeling kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Transient Transfection and Dual Luciferase Assay—Human fibroblasts were transfected using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total amount of DNA in each transfection was kept constant by the addition of appropriate empty vectors. Following incubation with or without 5 ng/ml TGF-β in media with 0.1% FCS, the cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and dual luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Transcriptional activities of reporter constructs were normalized against those of cotransfected pRLCMV (Promega).Real Time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Assay—The amounts of targeting mRNA was quantified as previously described (26Higashi K. Inagaki Y. Suzuki N. Mitsui S. Mauviel A. Kaneko H. Nakatsuka I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5156-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using ImProm-II reverse transcriptase (Promega). The relative mRNA expression levels of COL1A2 gene were normalized against those of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene in the same RNA preparation.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Four copies of SBE oligonucleotide were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and used as probes to examine the binding of recombinant YB-1 to the Smad3-DNA complex (30Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). DNA-protein complexes were separated from unbound oligonucleotide probe on 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE as previously described (25Higashi K. Kouba D.J. Song Y.J Uitto J. Mauviel A. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In some instances, a His6-tagged Smad3 (1–210) was preincubated with anti-pentahistidine antibodies (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C.Bacterially Expressed Recombinant Proteins—The His6-tagged proteins were produced using the pET system (Novagen) as previously described (26Higashi K. Inagaki Y. Suzuki N. Mitsui S. Mauviel A. Kaneko H. Nakatsuka I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5156-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The full-length YB-1 or Smad3 as well as their deletion mutants fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, bacteria were grown in LB medium and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 20 °C. The GST fusion proteins were isolated using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and eluted by 10 mm glutathione. Then the buffer was changed to phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using Centricon Plus-20 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The protein concentration was determined using a commercial assay kit.GST Pull-down Assay—Lysates of 293 EBNA cells transfected with YB-1 or Smad3 expression plasmid were prepared in 600 μl of 1× lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 30 mm Na4P2O7,50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100 at pH 7.1), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and inhibitors (20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm Na3VO4). GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, 30 μl of cell lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, and the bound proteins were detected by Western blotting using either anti-Smad3 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-YB-1 polyclonal antibodies prepared as previously described (31Ohga T. Koike K. Ono M. Makino Y. Itagaki Y. Tanimoto M. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4224-4228PubMed Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis—Nuclear or cytoplasmic proteins and total cell lysates were prepared from KHOS-240S cells or human fibroblasts. Immunoblotting was performed as previous described (26Higashi K. Inagaki Y. Suzuki N. Mitsui S. Mauviel A. Kaneko H. Nakatsuka I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5156-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) using anti-YB-1, anti-STAT1 (Transduction Labs, Lexington, KY), anti-phospho-STAT1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or anti-type I collagen antibodies (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). Filters were deprobed by incubation with 2 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.8) for 1 h. Equal loading of protein was confirmed by anti-lamin A/C antibodies (Santa Cruz) for nuclear proteins or anti-actin antibodies (Santa Cruz) for cytoplasmic proteins or total cell lysates. An ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) was used to detect immunoreactive proteins.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—293 EBNA cells transfected with the indicated expression vectors were lysed in 600 μlof 0.5× lysis buffer as previously described (32Janknecht R. Wells N.J. Hunter T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2114-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were performed using mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma) or anti-p300 monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) and protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The proteins bound to beads were washed with lysis buffer and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Smad3 or anti-YB-1 polyclonal antibodies.Immunofluorescence—Human fibroblasts were fixed with cold methanol, incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz). Intracellular localization of endogenous YB-1 or phospho-STAT1 was examined by fluorescence microscopy.Statistical Analysis—The values are expressed as the means ± S.D. A Student's t test was used to evaluate the statistical differences between groups; a p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSDifferent Signaling Pathways Mediate IFN-γ-induced Nuclear Translocation of YB-1 and STAT1—It has been previously reported that IFN-γ-induced phosphorylated STAT1 antagonizes TGF-β/Smad signaling by interfering with the interaction between Smad3 and p300/CBP transcriptional coactivators. Western blot analyses of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins prepared from IFN-γ-treated human fibroblasts indicated that IFN-γ initiates nuclear translocation of both YB-1 and STAT1 but with different kinetics (Fig. 1A). As previously described, phosphorylated STAT1 was observed in the nucleus as early as 0.5 h after IFN-γ treatment (33Leung S. Qureshi S.A. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1312-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas IFN-γ-induced nuclear translocation of YB-1 was observed 6 h later (26Higashi K. Inagaki Y. Suzuki N. Mitsui S. Mauviel A. Kaneko H. Nakatsuka I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5156-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The amounts of YB-1 and STAT1 present in cytoplasmic extracts were reciprocally decreased (Fig. 1A). It has been recently reported that IFN-γ stimulates CK2 activity and subsequently increases the expression of inducible cyclic AMP early repressor gene (34Mead J.R. Hughes T.R. Irvine S.A. Singh N.N. Ramji D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17741-17751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, YB-1 and other Y box proteins readily undergo phosphorylation by CK2 in a variety of cells (35Skabkin M.A. Evdokimova V. Thomas A.M. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44841-44847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether IFN-γ stimulates nuclear translocation of YB-1 through the CK2 pathway. For this purpose, human fibroblasts were preincubated for 1 h with aurintricarboxylic acid (36Chen C.W. Chao Y. Chang Y.H. Hsu M.J. Lin W.W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 1011-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), AG490 (34Mead J.R. Hughes T.R. Irvine S.A. Singh N.N. Ramji D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17741-17751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), or apigenin (34Mead J.R. Hughes T.R. Irvine S.A. Singh N.N. Ramji D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17741-17751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which inhibits Jak1/Jak2, Jak2, and CK2, respectively. The amount of nuclear phosphorylated STAT1 induced by IFN-γ was markedly decreased by Jak inhibitors aurintricarboxylic acid and AG490 but not by CK2 inhibitor apigenin (Fig. 1B). In contrast, incubation of human fibroblasts with aurintricarboxylic acid or apigenin decreased the amount of nuclear YB-1 induced by IFN-γ, whereas it was not affected by AG490 (Fig. 1B). Differential signaling pathways required for nuclear translocation of STAT1 and YB-1 were further confirmed by immunofluorescence experiments localizing subcellular distribution of endogenous STAT1 and YB-1. Consistent with the results of Western blot analyses, IFN-γ-induced nuclear accumulation of endogenous YB-1 was prevented by aurintricarboxylic acid (Fig. 1C, panel 3) or apigenin (Fig. 1C, panel 5) but not by AG490 (Fig. 1C, panel 4). Although cell cycle-dependent nuclear localization of YB-1 has been shown (37Jurchott K. Bergmann S. Stein U. Walther W. Janz M. Manni I. Piaggio G. Fietze E. Dietel M. Royer H.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27988-27996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), IFN-γ-induced nuclear translocation of YB-1 was observed independently from the cell culture conditions (data not shown). In contrast, the rapid nuclear translocation of STAT1 following IFN-γ treatment was completely abolished by aurintricarboxylic acid (Fig. 1C, panel 8) or AG490 (Fig. 1C, panel 9) but not by apigenin (Fig. 1C, panel 10). Treatment of cells with kinase inhibitors alone did not alter the subcellular distribution of endogenous STAT1 or YB-1 (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggested that IFN-γ initiates nuclear translocation of both STAT1 and YB-1 but through the different signaling pathways.Both YB-1 and STAT1 Are Necessary for COL1A2 Repression by IFN-γ—To examine the functional roles of YB-1 and STAT1, as well as their independence from each other, in mediating the inhibitory effects of IFN-γ on COL1A2 transcription, we employed the RNA interference technique using the YB-1- or STAT1-specific double-stranded RNAs. Those siRNA duplexes were directed against YB-1 (nucleotides 285–303) and STAT1α (nucleotides 1926–1944, STAT1β has same sequence), respectively, and transfected into KHOS-240S cells. Transfection efficiency of siRNA was almost 100%, and down-regulation of YB-1 or STAT1 had no effect on the cell number and morphology under the experimental conditions used (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2A, transfection with YB-1 siRNA, STAT1 siRNA, or both significantly decreased the expression of respective protein. In contrast, those siRNAs had no effect on the expression of each other (Fig. 2A). Treatment of control or YB-1 siRNA-transfected KHOS-240S cells with IFN-γ induced rapid phosphorylation of STAT1 in the nucleus, whereas phosphorylated STAT1 was hardly observed in the nucleus after IFN-γ treatment of STAT1 siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, treatment of control or STAT1 siRNA-transfected cells with IFN-γ for 6 h increased the amount of nuclear YB-1 about 3-fold (Fig. 2B). Under this experimental condition, we examined whether YB-1 and/or STAT1 mediate the inhibitory effects of INF-γ on COL1A2 transcription in the absence or presence of TGF-β. The basal and TGF-β-stimulated promoter activity remained unchanged by knockdown of either YB-1 or STAT1 expression (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the results of previous studies (18Ghosh A.K. Yuan W. Mori Y. Chen S.J. Varga J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11041-11048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 23Kahari V.M. Chen Y.Q. Su M.W. Ramirez F. Uitto J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), IFN-γ significantly inhibits the basal promoter activity and counter-repressed TGF-β-stimulated COL1A2 transcription. Down-regulation of YB-1 or STAT1 significantly suppressed these IFN-γ actions in the absence and presence of TGF-β (Fig. 2C). In addition, a complete diminution of IFN-γ-elicited repression of COL1A2 transcription was observed by knockdown of both YB-1 and STAT1 (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results indicated that IFN-γ induces nuclear translocation of YB-1 and STAT1, both of which are necessary for the full IFN-γ activity to inhibit basal and TGF-β-stimulated COL1A2 transcription.Fig. 2Both YB-1 and STAT1 are necessary to mediate transcriptional repression of COL1A2 by IFN-γ. A, KHOS-240S cells were transfected with 2 μg of double-stranded siRNA and incubated for 48 h. After additional transfection with 2 μg of siRNA for 48 h, the cell lysates were separated and blotted with YB-1 or STAT1 antibodies.

Studies with human embryonic kidney 293 cells indicate that unsaturated fatty acids interfere with oxysterols binding to LXR and antagonize oxysterol-induced LXRα activity. In this report, we evaluated the effects of unsaturated fatty acids on LXR-regulated hepatic gene expression. The LXR agonist, T1317, induced mRNAs encoding sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and two SREBP-1c-regulated lipogenic genes, e.g. fatty-acid synthase and the S14 protein in primary hepatocytes. Treatment of hepatocytes with eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) suppressed these mRNAs in the absence and presence of T1317. The cis-regulatory elements targeted by T1317 were not required for fatty-acid suppression of FAS or S14 promoter activity. In contrast to SREBP-1-regulated lipogenic genes, 20:5n-3 had no effect on the T1317 induction of ABCG5 or ABCG8 in the rat hepatoma cell line, FTO-2B. These two genes require LXR but not SREBP-1c for their expression. Feeding rats a diet supplemented with fish oil suppressed hepatic SREBP-1c-regulated genes and induced PPARα-regulated genes but had no effect on the LXR-regulated transcripts, CYP7A1, ABCG5, or ABCG8. Transfection studies, using either full-length hLXRα or a chimera containing only the LXRα ligand binding domain, indicate that a wide array of unsaturated fatty acids had little effect on LXRα activity in primary hepatocytes or FTO-2B. These studies suggest that LXRα is not a target for unsaturated fatty acid regulation in primary rat hepatocytes or in liver. Thus, oxysterol/LXR-mediated regulation of transcripts involved in bile acid synthesis or sterol efflux appear insensitive to dietary unsaturated fatty acids.

The high carbohydrate fat-free diet (glucose replaces sucrose) was obtained from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Aurora, OH). Meal feeding involved allowing the rats to eat between 8 a.m. and noon daily. Animals were either maintained on this diet or switched to a high carbohydrate diet supplemented with fish oil (10%, w/w) (Dyets, Bethlehem, PA).

Membranes were incubated with antibodies for SREBP-1c (IgG-2A4) obtained from the supernatant of the hybridoma cell line CRL 2121 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). The anti-mouse secondary antibody was obtained from Bio-Rad. The detection system employed the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). Effects of Eicosapentaenoic Acid (20:5n-3) and T1317 on SREBP-1c Expression in Primary Hepatocytes—The LXR agonist, TO901317 (T1317) was used in all studies with primary hepatocytes and FTO-2B cells. The native oxysterols, 22(R)hydroxycholesterol and 24,25-epoxycholesterol, have no effect on LXR activity or LXR-regulated transcripts in these cells, probably because of their rapid metabolism. T1317 at 5 μm was selected as the minimal dose to achieve reliable induction of LXR activity in primary hepatocytes and FTO-2B cells. In HEK293 cells, T1317-induced LXRα activity is attenuated by both 20:4n-6 and 20:5n-3, whereas PPARα activity was induced by these fatty acids. These effects on LXRα and PPARα activity correlated with significant changes in intracellular non-esterified unsaturated fatty acids (5Pawar A. Xu J. Jerks E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39243-39250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the studies reported here, 20:5n-3 was used as the fatty acid for most studies with primary hepatocytes and FTO-2B cells. 20:5n-3 is a very low abundance unsaturated fatty acid in primary hepatocytes and FTO-2B cells. Its addition at 250 μm leads to a >10-fold increase in the mass of 20:5n-3 in the intracellular non-esterified fatty acid pool of these cells. Changes in 20:5n-3 in the NEFA pool correlate with the suppression of SREBP-1c mRNA, as well as the activation of PPARα and PPARα-regulated genes (31Pawar A. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35931-35939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Treating primary hepatocytes with the LXR agonist, T1317 induced mRNASREBP-1c as well as the precursor (pSREBP-1) and nuclear (nSREBP-1) forms by 3- to 4-fold (Fig. 1). Treating cells with 20:5n-3 in the presence or absence of T1317 suppressed mRNASREBP-1c, pSREBP-1, and nSREBP-1 by 50–80%. This same pattern of control is seen for the 20:5n-3 and T1317 regulation of mRNAs encoding FAS and the S14 protein as well as reporter genes driven by the FAS and S14 promoters (Fig. 2, A and B). Whereas L-pyruvate kinase (LPK) mRNA and LPKCAT reporter gene were suppressed by 20:5n-3 treatment, T1317 did not induce this gene.Fig. 220:5n-3 and T1317 regulation of fatty acid synthase, S14 protein, and l-pyruvate kinase expression in rat primary hepatocytes. Primary hepatocytes were treated with 250 μm 20:5n-3 (black bars), 5 μm T1317 (shaded bars), or both compounds (striped bars) for 24 h. Vehicle-treated cells (white bars) received 50 μm BSA.

Results are expressed as relative mRNA abundance; the mRNA levels in the treated cells are normalized to the level of the corresponding RNA in a rat liver standard from a chow-fed male rat. These results are the mean ± S.D.; n = 9 of three separate studies B, primary hepatocytes were transfected with fatty acid synthase, S14, and L-pyruvate kinase reporter genes containing promoter elements fused to the CAT reporter gene. FASCAT contains -2363 to +16 bp of the FAS promoter, S14CAT contains -2800 to +19 bp of the S14 promoter, and LPKCAT contains -4300 to +14 bp of the L-pyruvate kinase promoter. After transfection, hepatocytes were treated with 20:5n-3 and T1317 as described above. After a 24-h treatment, cells were harvested for CAT and protein assays. Results are reported as fold change in CAT activity.

Our goal was to determine whether the T1317 effect on S14 promoter activity is simply caused by T1317/LXR-mediated induction of SREBP-1c. Accordingly, a detail promoter analysis was performed to locate the cis-regulatory target for T1317. Deletion and mutation analyses show that the T1317-RR is located in a region previously identified as a glucose regulatory region (GlRR, -1.6 to -1.4 kb) (Fig. 3A) (34Shih H.M. Towle H.C. J. Biol.

Deletion of the GlRR (-1.6 to -1.4 kb) or mutation of the E-box within (at -1440 bp) has no effect on PUFA suppression of S14CAT activity (Fig. 3B). In the context of the thymidine kinase promoter, neither the GlRR or the thyroid hormone regulatory region (TRR) are sensitive to 20: 5n-3 suppression. Preliminary studies suggest that at least two T1317 elements are located within the GlRR. Studies are underway to define these elements. A similar analysis using FASCAT reporter genes indicted that the FASCAT activity is suppressed 50% by 20:5n-3 treatment. Like the S14 promoter, the presence and absence of the LXRE at -669 bp (3Joseph S.B. Laffitte B.A. Patel P.H. Watson M.A. Matsukuma K.E. Walczak R. Collins J.L. Osborne T.F. Tontonoz P. J. Biol.

These studies show that although S14 and FAS have distinct cis-regulatory elements for T1317/LXR and SREBP-1c, the T1317/LXR-cis regulatory elements are not required for PUFA control of these transcripts in rat primary hepatocytes. 20:5n-3 Effects on LXR-regulated Transcripts in FTO-2B Hepatoma Cells—Although the expression of SREBP-1c and various lipogenic genes are easily examined in primary rat hepatocytes, certain LXR-regulated transcripts (e.g. CYP7A, ABCG5, and ABCG8) decrease to nearly undetectable levels when compared with their expression in liver. The reason for this decline is likely because of the loss of key transcription factors controlling expression of these transcripts. Fortunately, ABCG5 and ABCG8 are well expressed and regulated by T1317 in FTO-2B cells (25Repa J.J. Berge K.E. Pomajzl C. Richardson J.A. Hobbs H. Mangelsdorf D.J. J. Biol.

Upon prion conversion, Ure2p is inactivated, apparently by entering an aggregated filamentous state (6Masison D.C. Wickner R.B.

The filaments partition between daughter cells when an infected yeast cell divides, explaining the non-Mendelian genetics; filaments are introduced to a cell lacking [URE3] by cytoplasmic mixing when it fuses with a [URE3] cell, thus explaining the infectivity. Knowledge of the filament structure is essential for gaining further understanding of prionogenesis in this system. Ure2p consists of a C-terminal functional domain and an N-terminal prion domain (6Masison D.C. Wickner R.B.

The Ure2p functional domain binds to the transcription factor Gln3p, preventing its migration to the nucleus (12Blinder D. Coschigano P.W. Magasanik B. J.

This interaction is prevented in the prion state, probably by steric blocking of the binding site of Ure2p for Gln3p (15Baxa U. Speransky V. Steven A.C. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Asn-rich tract extends to residue 89, but residues 1–65 suffice for prion-forming ability (although 1–80 are more efficient). In native Ure2p, the N-terminal region is highly protease-sensitive and thought to be unstable or even unfolded (2Perrett S. Freeman S.J. Butler P.J. Fersht A.R. J. Mol.

Edskes H.K. Wickner R.B. Steven A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These filaments are similar in thickness (∼25 nm) to those assembled in vitro. (iii) The proteinase K digestion pattern of Ure2p in extracts of [URE3] cells is very similar to that of in vitro formed filaments (1Taylor K.L. Cheng N. Williams R.W. Steven A.C. Wickner R.B.

Backbones of polymerized prion domains have also been envisaged for Sup35p filaments (23Glover J.R. Kowal A.S. Schirmer E.C. Patino M.M. Liu J.J. Lindquist S.

On the other hand, an alternative model has recently been proposed whereby Ure2p molecules are connected to each other by N-terminal to C-terminal interactions, and the filaments do not contain amyloid (26Bousset L.

In this study, we have investigated the overall architecture of in vitro assembled Ure2p filaments and fusion protein filaments by a combination of biophysical and biochemical analyses. After controlled proteolytic digestion, the reaction products were analyzed by Western blotting, mass spectrometry, and conventional negative staining EM. We also visualized intact filaments by a high resolution negative staining technique in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) (28Muller S.A. Engel A. Micron. 2001; 32: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and by cryo-electron microscopy of vitrified specimens, and we measured their values of mass per unit length from dark-field STEM images of freeze-dried filaments (28Muller S.A.

The results of these experiments substantiate our amyloid core model of the filament structure and show that the prion domain residues, ∼1–70 form this core. They further indicate residues ∼71–90, although part of the prion domain by amino acid composition and prion-inducing ability are not in the central core but link it to C-terminal appendages. URE2 was cloned into a pFLAG vector (Kodak) by PCR using the primers 5′-ggaactcatatgcatcaccatcaccatcacatgtatccacgtgggaatatgatgaa-taacaacggc-3′ and 5′-ggaactgtcgacgaattctgtggttggggtaac-3′ and the NdeI and SalI restriction sites. To improve expression levels in Escherichia coli, the AGA codons 253 and 254 for arginine were replaced with CGT using site-directed PCR mutagenesis with the primers 5′-cggatgaggttcgtcgtgtttacggtgtag-3′ and 5′-ctacaccgtaaacacgacgaacctcatccg-3′ as described (31Komar A.A. Guillemet E. Reiss C. Cullin C. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 1295-1300PubMed Google Scholar), yielding plasmid pKT41-1. The N-terminal primer encodes a His6 tag and a thrombin cleavage site, and therefore pKT41-1 codes for a protein with the sequence: MH6MYPRGNUre2p1–354. Overexpression was performed using E. coli BL21 in LB medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C for 4 h after induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactosidase at an A 550 of ∼1.0. After harvesting, the cells were resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, containing protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science), and lysed by high pressure. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (40,000 × g, 1 h). The expressed protein was recovered in one step, using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (Qiagen). The protein was bound to the column in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, washed extensively with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. This protein was either used directly in experiments (His6-Ure2p) or digested with thrombin (Roche Applied Science) at room temperature for 20 h to remove the His6 tag. The sequences of Ure2p1–65, Ure2p1–80, and Ure2p1–89 were cloned in the pFLAG vector (Kodak) using PCR and the NdeI and SalI restriction sites, producing plasmids pKT53, pKT54, and pKT55, respectively. For all, the N-terminal primer included a His6 tag, however, without the thrombin cleavage site. The sequences of the proteins were MH6-Ure2p1–65, MH6-Ure2p1–80, and MH6-Ure2p1–89. Synthesis and purification of Ure2p1–65 was as described previously (1Taylor K.L. Cheng N. Williams R.W. Steven A.C. Wickner R.B. Science. 1999; 283: 1339-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Ure2p1–65-barnase, Ure2p1–65-CA, and Ure2p1–65-GST were prepared as described (15Baxa U. Speransky V. Steven A.C. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5253-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Plasmid pH469 coding for Ure2p1–80-SDDDDKGGRGFP-H6 was kindly supplied by H. Edskes. Ure2p1–65-GFP was cloned by digestion and religation of pH469 with NotI, exploiting the two NotI sites of pH469 after position 65 of Ure2p and in front of GFP, leading to pUB7. Expression from pUB7 yielded Ure2p1–65-GFP-H6. Expression and purification was performed as described for Ure2p1–80-GFP (15Baxa U. Speransky V. Steven A.C. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5253-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To keep numbering of amino acids in the different constructs clear, all proteins and fusion constructs were numbered with 1 being the first Met of Ure2p. Additional sequences at the N terminus (His6 tag and thrombin site) for some constructs were assigned negative numbers. All proteins were frozen in liquid nitrogen shortly after purification and stored at -80 °C to prevent filament formation. Filaments were assembled by incubating protein solutions (at 1–5 mg/ml) at 4 °C, usually in 20 mm Tris/HCl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. For Ure2p1–65-barnase the buffer was 20 mm Tris/HCl, 200 mm KCl, pH 7.5. For some fusion proteins, filament formation was accelerated by continual agitation of the solution. Filaments were purified by centrifugation (25,000 × g, 30 min) and washed at least two times with buffer before use. Rabbit antiserum Ure2-#2 has been described previously (1Taylor K.L. Cheng N.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To refine the specificity to Ure2p90–354, antibodies recognizing the region 64–89 were removed by passage over a 1.0-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (Qiagen) previously loaded with His6-Ure2p1–89 in 6 m GdnHCl (to prevent filament formation) and then changed back to 20 mm Tris/HCl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. 0.5 ml of a protein solution at 4–8 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris/HCl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, was incubated with proteinase K (Promega) (0.1 mg/ml, 30 units/mg) for 16–20 h at 37 °C. The insoluble material was collected by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and washed by resuspension in 20 mm Tris/HCl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, followed by centrifugation as above, three times. The pellet was then dissolved in either 6 m GdnHCl for mass spectrometry or in 10 m urea, 2% SDS with 5 min boiling for SDS-PAGE. For less rigorous digestion, the same protein sample was digested with 10 μg/ml proteinase K and incubated at 37 °C. Small aliquots were taken at various times and analyzed directly on SDS-PAGE gels. Samples were dissolved in 10 m urea, 2% SDS, and the urea concentration was kept as high as possible throughout the subsequent procedures. SDS-PAGE was performed on 10–20% gradient gels (ICN Biomedicals) with Tris-Tricine buffer. Gels were stained with Colloidal Coomassie (ICN Biomedicals) or used in Western blots to transfer proteins to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was treated with 0.2 m NaOH for 30 min before being treated with the standard procedure. This step proved to be necessary for reproducible staining of the proteinase K digests on Western blots (32Schlumpberger M. Wille H. Baldwin M.A. Butler D.A. Herskowitz I. Prusiner S.B. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 440-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). LC-MS was performed on an HP1100 LC-MSD system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA), consisting of a binary pump, a degasser, an autosampler, an absorbance detector, an HP1100 MSD, and a Chem-Station for data acquisition and processing. Mass spectra were acquired in positive-ion mode, scanning from 300 to 1700 m/z every 4 s. A Zorbax SB-C3 reversed phase column (150 mm × 2.1 mm) equipped with a guard column was used for chromatographic separation. The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min. Separation was done with a gradient of 5% acetic acid in water to acetonitrile at 40 °C. Proteins and peptides were detected using absorption at 280 nm and MS signal in the positive mode. However, peptides from the N-terminal domain of Ure2p did not show a signal at 280 nm, because they contain neither tryptophan nor tyrosine. Apomyoglobin was used as a calibration standard. CTEM—For negative staining, samples were adsorbed onto freshly glow-discharged carbon-coated grids, rinsed with water, and stained with 1% uranyl acetate. Micrographs were recorded on a Zeiss EM 902 (Leica, Deerfield, IL). For cryo-EM, drops were adsorbed to holey carbon films, blotted, vitrified, and imaged on a CM200-FEG microscope (FEI, Mahwah, NJ) (33Cheng N. Conway J.F. Watts N.R. Hainfeld J.F. Joshi V. Powell R.D. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.E. Steven A.C. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 127: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). STEM—Dark-field micrographs of freeze-dried specimen were recorded at 1.0 or 2.0 nm/pixel at the Brookhaven STEM resource. Mass measurements were performed by interactive analysis of the micrographs using PIC programs (34Trus B.L. Kocsis E. Conway J.F. Steven A.C. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Tobacco mosaic virus particles served as a mass standard (131.4 kDa/nm) (35Wall J.S. Hainfeld J.F. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 355-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Some samples were stained with 2% methylamine vanadate (Nanoprobes, Stony Brook, NY). Filament Formation Requires a Covalently Attached Prion Domain—Ure2p, Ure2p1–89, and the fusion proteins Ure2p1–65-barnase, Ure2p1–65-carbonic anhydrase (CA), Ure2p1–65-glutathione S-transferase (GST), Ure2p1–65-green fluorescent protein (GFP), and Ure2p1–80-GFP were expressed in E. coli and purified. Under the same conditions of incubation, all constructs formed filaments as detected by negative staining EM (Fig. 1). The filaments were either single (Type A) or paired (Type B) (15Baxa U. Speransky V. Steven A.C. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5253-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The width of single filaments increased with subunit molecular mass from ∼14 nm for Ure2p1–65-barnase (19.6 kDa) to ∼25 nm for Ure2p (41.8 kDa) (Fig. 1, bottom right panel). In no case did the C-terminal moiety, i.e. the appended protein without the Ure2p prion domain, form filaments under these conditions. It has been shown that the prion domain Ure2p1–65 promotes the polymerization of full-length Ure2p to form cofilaments (1Taylor K.L. Cheng N. Williams R.W. Steven A.C. Wickner R.B. Science. 1999; 283: 1339-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we tested whether it has the same effect on the C-terminal domain alone. This experiment was performed with several prion domain constructs (Ure2p1–65, Ure2p1–80, and Ure2p1–89) mixed with C-terminal domain constructs Ure2p81–354 or Ure2p65–354, or with Ure2p as a positive control. By SDS-PAGE, Ure2p was detected in the insoluble fraction with each prion domain construct, and filaments were observed by negative staining. However, neither Ure2p65–354 nor Ure2p81–354 was detected in the insoluble fraction for any prion domain construct. These data show that a covalently attached prion domain is needed for the protein to enter filaments. Filaments of Ure2p and Fusion Constructs All Have Protease-resistant Core Fibers—All filament preparations were subjected to extensive digestion with proteinase K (100 μg/ml at 37 °C for 16 h). In each case, the reaction left sedimentable material consisting of much thinner filaments (Fig. 1). These filaments had the same diameter (4 nm) and tendency to aggregate into bundles (Fig. 1), whether they were derived from Ure2p or any of the fusion protein filaments; in these properties, they resemble polymers of Ure2p1–65 (1Taylor K.L. Cheng N. Williams R.W. Steven A.C. Wickner R.B. Science. 1999; 283: 1339-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and Ure2p1–89 (Fig. 1). Similarly, thin filaments were observed in earlier work after proteinase K digestion of cofilaments of Ure2p and Ure2p1–65 (1Taylor K.L. Cheng N. Williams R.W. Steven A.C. Wickner R.B. Science. 1999; 283: 1339-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), with the qualification that those digestions were less rigorous and some of the resulting filaments had patches of greater width between 4-nm segments. 3K. L. Taylor, N. Cheng, R. B. Wickner, and A. C. Steven, unpublished results. Congo Red staining of the digested material produced apple-green birefringence, indicating that they are amyloid (Supplementary Fig. S1). Again, this is a property that they share with Ure2p1–65 filaments (1Taylor K.L. Cheng N. Williams R.W. Steven A.C. Wickner R.B. Science. 1999; 283: 1339-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 32Schlumpberger M. Wille H. Baldwin M.A. Butler D.A. Herskowitz I. Prusiner S.B. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 440-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The Protease-resistant Core Fibers Consist of N-terminal Peptides—To determine which fragments of Ure2p make up the thin filaments, this material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). With Coomassie Blue staining, all constructs yielded a fuzzy band at ∼10 kDa (Fig. 2). The specific affinity of these bands for the dye is about 2-fold lower than that of intact Ure2p, as determined by quantitative gel analysis. All of these bands reacted positively with a polyclonal antiserum that specifically recognizes Ure2p1–80; conversely, an antibody specific for Ure2p90–354 did not detect this material (Fig. 2). In contrast, digestions of soluble Ure2p with proteinase K for 16 h produced very little insoluble material, and no filaments were detected by EM. Moreover, no band was visible on Coomassie-stained gels or Western blots using either the C- or N-terminal antibody (data not shown). If the proteinase K digestion was less rigorous (10 μg/ml at 37 °C for up to 1 h) and soluble material was not separated from insoluble material, then Ure2p filaments yielded similar digestion patterns to those obtained from soluble Ure2p or C-terminal domain (Ure2p65–354) (Fig. 3). The main bands revealed by Coomassie staining correspond to fragments of the C-terminal domain, as identified by Western blots (Fig. 3). The N-terminal fragments are inconspicuous, because fragments of the C-terminal domain run in the same region of the gel (7–10 kDa) and stain more strongly with Coomassie Blue. We further characterized these earlier stages of proteinase K digestion of Ure2p filaments by mass spectrometry and gel analysis (Fig. 3). The first cut is between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains around residue 95 and produces a C-terminal fragment of ∼30 kDa. This fragment is not stable, however, and a second cut follows around residue 285 in the so-called cap region, a flexible loop that is unique to Ure2p among GST-like proteins (18Bousset L. Belrhali H. Janin J. Melki R. Morera S. Structure. 2001; 9: 39-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), producing relatively stable fragments of ∼20 and ∼8 kDa (Fig. 3). These fragments are subject to fraying at the ends as detected by mass spectrometry and by slight shifts to lower masses on SDS gels. Fraying is observed from residue 95 up to 120 and in the cap region from residue 285 down to 272 and up to 294. Further cleavage then takes place at sites that appear to be protected initially but become exposed as a result of prior cuts and fraying: cutting around residue 150 generates another relatively stable fragment at ∼14 kDa and cutting around residue 230 generates a fragment at ∼9 kDa. When fusion protein filaments were subjected to similar, less rigorous, proteinase K digestion (10 μg/ml at 37 °C for up to 1 h) without separation of insoluble material, each construct gave a characteristic pattern on SDS gels with Coomassie staining, indistinguishable from that obtained from unpolymerized protein (data not shown). Again, because of the weak staining of Ure2p N-domain, these patterns were dominated by fragments of the C-terminal moieties, in this case the appended proteins. GST and CA were digested slightly more slowly than Ure2p but were completely degraded after 16 h. However, GFP and barnase were rather resistant to proteinase K. Most of the GFP was still native and functional but detached from the filaments and found in the soluble fraction (Fig. 2, bottom panel). Some barnase was also found in native and active form in the post-digestion supernatant. These observations indicate that"
https://openalex.org/W2162301522,"We have investigated the conformational transition and aggregation process of recombinant Syrian hamster prion protein (SHaPrP90–232) by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, light scattering, and electron microscopy under equilibrium and kinetic conditions. SHaPrP90–232 showed an infrared absorbance spectrum typical of proteins with a predominant α-helical structure both at pH 7.0 and at pH 4.2 in the absence of guanidine hydrochloride. At pH 4.2 and destabilizing conditions (0.3–2 m guanidine hydrochloride), the secondary structure of SHaPrP90–232 was transformed to a strongly hydrogen-bonded, most probably intermolecularly arranged antiparallel β-sheet structure as indicated by dominant amide I band components at 1620 and 1691 cm-1. Kinetic analysis of the transition process showed that the decrease in α-helical structures and the increase in β-sheet structures occurred concomitantly according to a bimolecular reaction. However, the concentration dependence of the corresponding rate constant pointed to an apparent third order reaction. No β-sheet structure was formed within the dead time (190 ms) of the infrared experiments. Light scattering measurements revealed that the structural transition of SHaPrP90–232 was accompanied by formation of oligomers, whose size was linearly dependent on protein concentration. Extrapolation to zero protein concentration yielded octamers as the smallest oligomers, which are considered as “critical oligomers.” The small oligomers showed spherical and annular shapes in electron micrographs. Critical oligomers seem to play a key role during the transition and aggregation process of SHaPrP90–232.

Amyloid. 1998; 5: 212-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The most important ones among them are bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, scrapie in sheep, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. The crucial step in transmission and manifestation of prion diseases is the conversion of benign monomeric cellular prion protein (PrPC), which has a mainly α-helical secondary structure, to pathogenic multimeric scrapie prion protein (PrPSc), which is predominantly folded into β-sheets (4Caughey B.W.

It is noteworthy that PrPC and PrPSc do not differ in their amino acid sequence. Similar mechanisms play an essential role in a number of other neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. Therefore, the coupled processes of protein misfolding and aggregation, the kinetics of these processes, and the molecular species involved are of fundamental interest. Late products of the conversion are amyloid fibrils and amyloid plaques, which are widely considered to be direct effectors of the above mentioned disorders. However, evidence is accumulating that intermediates or by-products of the assembly process could be the pathogenic form of PrP (6Chiesa R. Harris D.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 743-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 7Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S.

Nature. 2002; 418: 291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). In vitro transition of unglycosylated recombinant fragments of PrPC into aggregated, β-rich, yet not infectious isoforms has been reported for a number of sequences from different species (9Morillas M.

A particularly interesting β-rich oligomer has recently been reported (10Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol.

This oligomer was described as consisting of at least eight monomers and appearing as a transient species under conditions favoring the formation of mature fibrillar structures (acidic pH, 2–4 m urea, incubation at 37 °C, constant agitation) (10Baskakov I.V.

Chem. 2002; 277: 21140-21148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) or as a relatively stable end product under conditions optimized for the formation of the oligomer (pH 4 and 2 m GdnHCl or pH 2 and 5 m urea, incubation at 23 °C) (11Lu B.-Y. Chang J.-Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The structural formation of the β-rich oligomer takes place with PrP exhibiting the intact disulfide bridge and comprises the important initial reorganization of the secondary structure, namely a decrease of α-helical structure and an increase of β-sheet structure. Since the β-rich oligomer could be both an important precursor of later stages of the assembly process and a toxic species in itself, we have studied its formation, structural properties, and subsequent structural transitions in more detail using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, static (SLS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS), CD spectroscopy, and electron microscopy. The combination of all of these techniques provided solid information on secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structural changes and morphological properties of PrP. Since our expression and purification system differed from those published earlier (12Hornemann S. Korth C. Oesch B. Riek R. Wider G. Wüthrich K. Glockshuber R.

It is worth mentioning that it led to a product with >99% high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purity. SHaPrP90–232 was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) transformed by a pET-15b vector (Novagen) in which the sequence corresponding to amino acids 90–232 of the prion protein of the Syrian hamster was cloned. huPrP91–231 was expressed in an equivalent system. The pET-15b vector contains the sequences for a His6 tag and a thrombin cleavage site directly C-terminal to this tag. For cultivation, 100 μl of bacteria suspension were grown for 7–8 h at 37 °C in 10 ml of Luria-Bertoni medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (LB + Amp). This culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB + Amp. After growth for 16 h, the culture was centrifuged for 10 min at 2350 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of LB medium and used to inoculate 1 liter of LB + Amp. After growth for 30 min at 37 °C, the overexpression of PrP was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside. After an additional 5 h at 37 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2350 × g. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na-EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 7.2) and stirred for 30 min. 1 mmol of MgCl2 (final concentration 19 mm) and 500 units of Benzonase (Roche Applied Science) were added. After an additional 5 min, the lysate was centrifuged at 10,240 × g. The pellet was washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. For purification, PrP was extracted from cell lysate equivalent to 2 liters of cell culture and reduced by resuspending the pellet in 40 ml of reduction buffer (50 mm Tris, 6 m GdnHCl, 50 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4). After centrifugation (30 min at 25,280 × g) and vacuum filtration through a 0.45-μm filter, the protein solution was applied to 10 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), which was prewashed in guanidine buffer (50 mm Tris, 6 m GdnHCl, pH 7.4) and incubated for 30 min under shaking. Nonspecifically bound proteins were removed by washing three times with guanidine buffer and once with guanidine buffer plus 1 mm imidazole. The agarose with bound PrP was filled into an “Econo-Pac” column (Bio-Rad). PrP was eluted by 20 ml of guanidine buffer plus 250 mm imidazole. To prevent formation of oligomers, eluted PrP was collected in 50 ml of guanidine buffer. The concentration of PrP was determined by HPLC analysis (ET 250/4 Nucleosil 300–7 C8 column (Macherey-Nagel); HP 1050 device (Hewlett-Packard)). Elution was performed by a linear gradient of 30–60% eluent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) in eluent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) over 12 min. The solution was diluted to 0.25 mg/ml with guanidine buffer and oxidized by adding 2 μm CuSO4 and stirring overnight at room temperature. Completion of oxidation was monitored by HPLC analysis. After concentration to 1–2 mg/ml, the PrP solution was diluted 1:10 into Tris buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0) to allow refolding of the protein. After 1–2 h, precipitated PrP was removed by filtration. The solution was concentrated to a final volume of 100 ml and dialyzed against Tris buffer. During dialysis, 10 units of thrombin per mg PrP were added. Cleavage of the His6 tag was allowed to take place overnight at room temperature. Completion of cleavage was checked by SDS-PAGE. Due to the vector construction, the expressed and cleaved PrP contained N-terminally four additional amino acids (Gly-Ser-His-Met). The PrP solution was filtrated, 10 μl of protease inhibitor (Complete, Mini, EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science) were added, and the solution was concentrated to a final volume of 25 ml. After dialysis overnight against phosphate buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0), PrP was analyzed by HPLC, sterile filtrated, and stored at -20 °C until final purification. For final purification, GdnHCl was added to the prepurified PrP samples to obtain a concentration of 6 m. 10–15 mg of PrP were loaded on an EP 250/16 Nucleosil 300–7 C8 column (Macherey-Nagel). A solvent port had to be used to load the column with the sample. To prevent precipitation of the protein in the pump, the HPLC system was prewashed thoroughly with 6 m GdnHCl at a flow rate of 8 ml/min. Elution was performed by a linear gradient of 30–40% eluent B in eluent A over 20 min at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. PrP-containing fractions were pooled, lyophilized, resuspended in guanidine/phosphate buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4,6 m GdnHCl, pH 7.0), and dialyzed against the same buffer to remove residual trifluoroacetic acid, which has a very intense C=O stretching band at 1680 cm-1 in the amide I region. Afterward, PrP was refolded by diluting 1:10 with phosphate buffer. After 1–2 h, precipitated protein was removed by filtrating. The solution was dialyzed against phosphate buffer. For examination at pH 4.2, PrP was furthermore dialyzed against acetate buffer (20 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.2). The purity of the protein was determined by HPLC and SDS-PAGE; identity of the protein was verified by mass spectroscopic analysis. Stopped Flow Device—All measurements were performed using a novel stopped flow device, linked to an IFS 28/B FTIR spectrometer (Bruker Optics, Germany) equipped with a rapid scan option. The stopped flow device was designed specifically for high precision FTIR kinetic and difference spectroscopy of biological macromolecules in 1H2O and is described in detail elsewhere (17Masuch R. Moss D.A. Appl. Spectroscopy. 2003; 57 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, the principle elements of the system are a two-channel high pressure syringe pump, a microstructured diffusional mixer, and a specially designed thin layer infrared flow cell. HPLC tubing and fittings are used throughout. Samples are injected into a continuous flow of distilled water via HPLC sample injection valves under computer control, and the measurement is triggered after the flow is stopped when the samples have filled the flow cell. For the measurements described in the present work, a flow rate of 3 ml/min and a sample loop volume of 15 μl were used. The dead time of the experiment (i.e. the time delay between mixing the samples and obtaining the first spectrum) was an average value of 190 ms. Kinetic measurements of the transition of PrP were performed by mixing GdnHCl and PrP solutions in the stopped flow device, and the appropriate control experiments were performed with GdnHCl or PrP alone. The particular advantages of this stopped flow device for the present work were the extremely precise and reproducible cell path length, the short time between sample and reference data acquisitions, and the very gentle mixing achieved with the diffusion micromixer. These benefits resulted in the unprecedentedly high quality of the FTIR spectra presented below. FTIR Parameters—The interferograms were recorded double sided (forward-backward) at a mirror frequency of 200 kHz. The upper and lower frequency folding limits were 7899 and 0 cm-1, respectively. A Blackman-Harris three-term function and a zero filling factor of 4 were used for Fourier transformation, resulting in spectra encoding ∼1 data point per 1 cm-1. The path length of the flow cell was ∼8 μm. The nonlinearity of the MCT detector was corrected prior to Fourier transformation. Acquisition of Protein Spectra—The initial PrP concentration was 8 mg/ml. Since all PrP solutions were diluted 1:2 in the stopped flow device, measurements were performed at a concentration of 4 mg/ml (∼0.24 mm). The GdnHCl-containing solutions were buffered by either 20 mm NaH2PO4 or 20 mm sodium acetate to ensure proper pH values of 7.0 or 4.2, respectively. Steady state spectra of either buffer or PrP plus buffer were measured independently five times with 256 scans in each case and finally averaged. Buffer absorbance was subtracted from PrP plus buffer spectra. Time-resolved spectra of buffered GdnHCl solutions and buffered PrP plus GdnHCl mixtures were measured in the rapid scan mode. All spectra were recorded continuously; the time lag between two spectra was determined by the number of scans per spectrum (see below). The acquisition processor of the FTIR spectrometer had a capacity to store 60 spectra. The early ones were recorded with a low number of scans to get spectra with high time resolution but low signal/noise ratio; the later ones were recorded with more scans to obtain spectra with a higher signal/noise ratio. Since the reaction kinetics of the α-β transition was a function of GdnHCl concentration, the distribution pattern of scans per spectrum was adjusted as needed (Table I).Table IDistribution pattern of scans per spectrum for all measured GdnHCl concentrations Since no more than 60 spectra could be stored for each rapid scan measurement, the number of scans and thus the time of measurement (larger numbers of averaged scans result in longer times of measurement) for each of the 60 spectra had to be chosen in order to observe the whole reaction with an appropriate time resolution.Measurement at 0.3 M GdnHClaTotal time of measurement 380 sMeasurement at 0.5, 0.7, and 1.0 M GdnHClbTotal time of measurement 273 sMeasurement at 1.5 and 2.0 M GdnHClcTotal time of measurement 243 sNo. of spectraNo. of scans averaged per spectrumNo. of spectraNo. of scans averaged per spectrumNo. of spectraNo. of scans averaged per spectrum10210215210410410410810810161032103210321012815128101281051255125512a Total time of measurement 380 sb Total time of measurement 273 sc Total time of measurement 243 s Open table in a new tab The pure PrP spectra were obtained by subtracting GdnHCl and buffer spectra. To obtain the time-dependent changes, the difference spectra between each of the 60 single spectra and the last spectrum (i.e. the 60th spectrum) were calculated. Due to small instabilities of the FTIR spectrometer, base-line shifts in the range of ±0.0002 absorbance units were observed between subsequent spectra and were offset corrected using the region from 1900 to 1750 cm-1, which is free of spectral features, as a reference. Second derivatives were calculated by applying the Savitzky and Golay algorithm with nine smoothing points (18Savitzky A. Golay M.J.E. Anal. Chem. 1964; 36: 1627-1639Crossref Scopus (14771) Google Scholar). For evaluation of structural changes of PrP taking place within the experimental dead time, the difference between the first of the 60 spectra obtained after mixing PrP with GdnHCl and a steady state spectrum of PrP in the absence of GdnHCl was calculated. SLS and DLS were measured simultaneously with one and the same instrument at a scattering angle of 90°. The laboratory-built apparatus, presently equipped with a diode-pumped, continuous wave laser Millennia IIs (Spectra-Physics) and a high quantum yield avalanche photodiode, has been described in detail (19Gast K. Nöppert A. Müller-Frohne M. Zirwer D. Damaschun G. Eur. Biophys. J. 1997; 25: 211-219Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Apparent molar masses were estimated from the relative scattering intensities using toluene as a reference sample and applying a refractive index increment (∂n/∂c) = 0.19 ml/g. The translational diffusion coefficients D were obtained from the measured autocorrelation functions using either the program CONTIN (20Provencher S.W. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27: 229-242Crossref Scopus (2520) Google Scholar) or applying the method of cumulants (21Koppel D.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1972; 57: 4814-4820Crossref Scopus (2716) Google Scholar). The diffusion coefficients were converted into Stokes radii via the Stokes-Einstein equation R S = k B T/(6πη0 D), where k B is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature in kelvin, and η0 is the solvent viscosity. For kinetic light scattering experiments, two experimental schemes were used. At high protein concentrations, prefiltered (100-nm pore size) solutions and solvents were rapidly mixed in 100-μl fluorescence cells. At low concentrations, mixing was done before filtration into 30-μl flow-through cells. CD measurements were carried out at protein concentrations between 0.2 and 1.2 mg/ml on a J-720 (JASCO) CD spectrometer, which was calibrated with (+)-camphorsulfonic acid at 290.5 and 192.5 nm (22Johnson Jr., W.C. Proteins. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). 1- and 0.1-mm path length cells were used at low and high protein concentrations, respectively. Mean residue molar ellipticities [θ] were calculated using the mean residue weight of 113.9. Kinetic measurements were done by manually mixing the protein (buffered by 20 mm sodium acetate, 50 mm NaCl, pH 4.2) with a certain amount of GdnHCl-containing buffer to obtain a final concentration of 1 m GdnHCl. The dead time of mixing was about 20 s; the first complete spectrum was obtained 1 min after initiation of the experiment. Before preparation for electron microscopy, samples were diluted to a protein concentration of about 30 μg/ml with the corresponding solvent. Specimens were visualized by negative staining with 1% uranyl formate using a double-carbon film technique. 400 mesh copper grids covered with a carbon-coated Triafol microgrid were used as support. Micrographs were taken with an EM910 electron microscope (LEO) at 80 kV and a magnification of 63,000. The time series of FTIR spectra between 1200 and 1900 cm-1 was analyzed by singular value decomposition using the implemented singular value decomposition routine of the program package “Mathematica” (version 4.2; Wolfram Research). A fundamental question concerning the evaluation of the kinetic data, particularly in the present case, is the reaction order of the process under study. Since aggregation is involved in the transition process, an apparent higher order reaction must be taken into consideration. First order reactions follow exponential functions A(t) = A(0)·e -(k·t), whereas higher order reactions are characterized by a power law of the form, A(t)-(n-1)-A(0)-(n-1)=(n-1)·k·t(Eq. 1) where A represents any physical quantity, n is the reaction order, and k is the intrinsic reaction rate. A good test of the reaction order without explicitly specifying the type of the functional dependence is to plot (A(t) - A(0))/t versus A(t) (23Mauser, H. (1974) Formale Kinetik, Bertelsmann Universitätsverlag, Düsseldorf, GermanyGoogle Scholar). This plot is strictly linear for n = 2, allowing us to estimate k from the slope of the data, and shows characteristic curvatures for n = 1 and higher order reactions. Both FTIR and CD kinetics were treated in this way. In special cases (n > 1), the kinetics were fitted directly by a power law function with arbitrary n. If A(t) is directly the monomer concentration c(t) or is proportional to c(t), the equation below follows from Equation 1. c(t)=c(0)·11+(n-1)·c(0)(n-1)·k·t(Eq. 2) This enables one to calculate the reaction order n from the concentration dependence of the apparent reaction rate τ-1 = (n - 1)·c(0)(n-1)·k by plotting -ln(τ) versus ln(c(0)). Large quantities of recombinant PrP (10–20 mg/liter of E. coli culture) were obtained in >99% purity as proven by SDS-PAGE, HPLC, and mass spectrometry (data not shown) due to the two-step purification procedure. The purified PrP was quantitatively oxidized as proven by HPLC (data not shown). Steady-state FTIR Spectroscopy—The stopped flow device with its sealed flow cell enabled the recording of highly reproducible FTIR spectra of the prion protein in H2O with a high signal/noise ratio of 250 at the amide I peak near 1653 cm-1 as is exemplarily illustrated in Fig. 1A. This figure shows superimposed seven independently measured PrP spectra (note the small absorbance values due to the relatively low PrP concentration and the 8-μm path length of the measurement cell). For band assignment and detailed analysis of spectral features, second derivatives were calculated in order to enhance the apparent spectral resolution (Fig. 1B). Band assignments were made according to the relevant literature (see e.g. Refs. 24Krimm S. Bandekar J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 181-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (2677) Google Scholar, 25Fabian H. Mäntele W. Chalmers J.M. Griffiths P.R. Handbook of Vibrational Spectroscopy. Vol. 5. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., Chichester, UK2002: 3399-3425Google Scholar, 26Barth A. Zscherp C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2002; 35: 369-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Briefly, the prominent band centered at 1653 cm-1 (see Fig. 1A) is due to the amide I mode (essentially comprising the C=O stretching vibration of all backbone amide groups), whereas the band at 1550 cm-1 is due to the amide II mode (essentially due to the N-H in-plane bending and C-N stretching motions of the secondary amide functional groups) (24Krimm S. Bandekar J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 181-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (2677) Google Scholar). Both bands are conformation-sensitive and (particularly the amide I band) are frequently used to describe the secondary structure of proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 25Fabian H. Mäntele W. Chalmers J.M. Griffiths P.R. Handbook of Vibrational Spectroscopy. Vol. 5. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., Chichester, UK2002: 3399-3425Google Scholar, 26Barth A. Zscherp C. Q. Rev.

Calculation of second derivatives (Fig. 1B, curves 1 and 2) revealed a fine structure of several component bands that can be assigned to different secondary structure elements and specific amino acid side chains. The prominent bands at 1652 and 1550 cm-1 are both due to α-helical and the amide I component at 1678 cm-1 to turn and/or loop structures (25Fabian H. Mäntele W. Chalmers J.M. Griffiths P.R. Handbook of Vibrational Spectroscopy. Vol. 5. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., Chichester, UK2002: 3399-3425Google Scholar, 26Barth A. Zscherp C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2002; 35: 369-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Only a very weak band is visible at 1628 cm-1 due to β-sheet structure. The band at 1517 cm-1 is attributed to the amino acid side chain absorbance of tyrosine, and the bands at 1575, 1597, and 1615 cm-1 are tentatively assigned to vibrational modes of aspartate, glutamine, and predominantly tyrosine residues, respectively (28Barth A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 141-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Between pH 7.0 and 4.2, practically no structural changes of PrP could be detected as judged from the second derivative spectra of Fig. 1B (curves 1 and 2) and the difference spectrum between both (Fig. 1B, curve 3). The small difference feature around 1646 cm-1 is possibly due to a small frequency shift and intensity change of the α-helix band between PrP at pH 7.0 and at pH 4.2, indicating some minor differences in helical structure. This finding is in good conformity with our CD and DLS data, which indicated a small decrease in helical content and compactness of PrP on the transition from pH 7.0 to 4.2 (see below). The band at 1415 cm-1 remains unassigned. Only very slight differences were observed between the FTIR spectra of hamster and human PrP at pH 7 (data not shown). This is not surprising, because both proteins have a high sequence homology (87% of the amino acids are identical) and exhibit almost identical three-dimens"
https://openalex.org/W2034673903,"The central event in the pathogenesis of prion diseases, a group of fatal, transmissible neurodegenerative disorders including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, is the conversion of the normal or cellular prion protein (PrPC) into the abnormal or scrapie isoform (PrPSc). The basis of the PrPC to PrPSc conversion is thought to involve the diminution of α-helical domains accompanied by the increase of β structures within the PrP molecule. Consequently, treatment of PrPSc with proteinase K (PK) generates a large PK-resistant C-terminal core fragment termed PrP27-30 that in human prion diseases has a gel mobility of ∼19-21 kDa for the unglycosylated form, and a ragged N terminus between residues 78 and 103. PrP27-30 is considered the pathogenic and infectious core of PrPSc. Here we report the identification of two novel PK-resistant, but much smaller C-terminal fragments of PrP (PrP-CTF 12/13) in brains of subjects with sporadic CJD. PrP-CTF 12/13, like PrP27-30, derive from both glycosylated as well as unglycosylated forms.

Therefore, PrP-CTF12/13 are 64-76 amino acids N-terminally shorter than PrP27-30 and are about half of the size of PrP27-30. PrP-CTF12/13 are likely to originate from a subpopulation of PrPSc distinct from that which generates PrP27-30.

Most of them are characterized by the deposition of an abnormal prion protein, PrPSc, in brain.

It is thought that the PrPC to PrPSc conversion involves the decrease of α-helical domains accompanied by the increase of β structures in the midportion of the PrP molecule (19Caughey B.W. Dong A.

However, the precise location and extent of these structural changes within the PrP molecule and therefore, the tertiary and quaternary structures of PrPSc, are largely a matter of speculation. Full-length PrPSc and PrP27-30 are the only known components of the naturally occurring infectious agent causing prion diseases (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the role of PrPSc in the pathogenesis of these changes is poorly understood. This issue is further compounded by the presence of other derivatives of PrPSc in human and animal prion diseases, particularly the 7- 8-kDa-truncated PrP fragments found in GSS (23Tagliavini F.

We have now characterized two novel C-terminal fragments of PrP in brains of patients with sporadic CJD (sCJD). These PrP fragments migrate at about 12 and 13 kDa on Tris-Tricine gradient gel, and have the N terminus that begins at residues 162/167 and 154/156, respectively, as determined by automated Edman degradation. They are resistant to PK digestion and derive from both glycosylated and unglycosylated forms. We propose that these fragments are distinct from PrP27-30 and derive from a subpopulation of full-length as well as N-terminally truncated PrPSc carrying a different conformation.

All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless specified otherwise. Brain Tissues—Human brain tissues were collected at autopsy or biopsy and were kept frozen at -80 °C until use. Brains from subjects with sporadic CJD were confirmed by histological examination, and by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting to show the presence of PrPSc as described (29Chen S.G. Teplow D.B.

The control human brains were obtained from individuals unaffected by prion disease. Molecular Genetics—Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen brain tissue. The methionine/valine polymorphism at codon 129 was determined as we described previously (33Goldfarb L.G. Petersen R.B. Tabaton M. Brown P. LeBlanc A.C. Montagna P. Cortelli P. Julien J. Vital C.

PK Digestion and Deglycosylation of PrP—Brain homogenates (10%, w/v) were prepared on ice in lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P 40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and samples were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to remove cellular debris. To prepare the detergent-insoluble fraction (P2), brain homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer. For PK digestion of PrP, samples were incubated with PK at 100 μg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C, and the digestion was then terminated by the addition of 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For deglycoyslation of the protein, samples were denatured and incubated in the presence of recombinant peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis, and Immunoblotting— Samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2 × gel loading buffer (6% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 4 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and boiled for 10 min. Proteins were separated by Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE (10-17% gradient gels, 16 × 20 × 0.1 cm), as described previously (29Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19173-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed as described by the supplier with minor modifications using PROTEIN IEF cell (Bio-Rad). For the first dimension isoelectric focusing, P2 fraction boiled in gel loading buffer was precipitated by 9-fold volume of chilled acetone at -20 °C for 1.5 h, followed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 10% trichloroacetic acid for 2 h at room temperature and were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of rehydration buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 0.5% ampholine pH 3-10, and trace amounts of bromphenol blue), and were loaded onto the immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips for rehydration at 50 V for 14 h. The rehydrated IPG strips were focused for about 40 kVh. For the second dimension SDS-PAGE, the focused IPG strips were equilibrated for 15 min each in equilibration buffer 1 (6 m urea, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 2% DTT, and 0.375 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8), and then in equilibration buffer 2 (6 m urea, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 2.5% iodoacetamide and 0.375 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8). The equilibrated strips were loaded onto 16.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad Criterion gels). Electrophoresis was conducted at 120 V. Proteins on the SDS-PAGE gels were electrotransferred onto PVDF membranes at 70 V for 2 h at 4 °C. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) overnight at 4 °C prior to incubation with antibodies. Membrane-bound proteins were probed with either anti-C antibody at 1:3,000 or with 3F4 antibody at 1:50,000. Following washes with TBST, the PVDF membranes were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). The PrP bands were visualized on Kodak X-Omat films by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus kit, Amersham Biosciences). Purification of PK-resistant PrP-CTF 12/13—Brain tissues (5-10 g) were used for purification of PK-resistant PrPSc fragments according to the published method (34Bolton D.C. Bendheim P.E. Marmorstein A.D. Potempska A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), as modified (35Chen S.G. Parchi P. Brown P. Capellari S. Zou W.Q. Cochran E.J.

After the final sedimentation of PK-resistant PrPSc fragments by ultracentrifugation, the pellets were denatured and treated with PNGase F. PrP-CTF 12/13 were purified further by micropreparative continuous elution SDS-PAGE (16% gel, Mini Prep Cell apparatus, Bio-Rad). Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 70 μl/min and collected into 400 μl fractions. The fractions containing PrP-CTF 12/13 were pooled and lyophilized. Immunoblotting with anti-C antibody was used to monitor the purification throughout the procedures. N-terminal Protein Sequencing—Purified proteins were separated by 10-20% mini Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gradient gels (Novex pre-cast gel, Invitrogen), transferred onto Problott membranes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. N-terminal protein sequencing by automated Edman degradation was performed as described previously (18Parchi P. Zou W.Q. Wang W. Brown P. Capellari S. Ghetti B. Kopp N. Schulz-Schaeffer W.J. Kretzschmar H.A. Head M.W. Ironside J.W. Gambetti P. Chen S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

N-terminal sequencing typically proceeded for 10 cycles. Multiple N-terminal sequences were obtained by alignment of the experimentally determined amino acids at each cycle with the translated human PrP sequence (Swiss-Prot accession number: P04156). Triton X-114 Phase Separation—Phase separation of PrP in Triton X-114 was performed as described (37Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Brain tissues were homogenized in 1% Triton X-114 in PBS. 200 μl of brain homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 s at 4 °C. The supernatant (100 μl) was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1 min. A solution of 1% Triton X-114/PBS (600 μl) was added into the detergent phase and samples were split into two parts. The samples were incubated with (+) or without (-) phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC) (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight, and the phase separation repeated. Sandwich Blotting of GPI-anchored PrP with Proaerolysin—GPI-anchored proteins were detected with proaerolysin-mediated sandwich blotting according to the published procedure (38Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12170-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Proteins transferred onto the PVDF membrane were incubated with proaerolysin (Protox Biotech, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) at 0.5 μg/ml in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was incubated with anti-proaerolysin monoclonal antibody (Protox Biotech, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) at 1:8,000 for 1 h. After wash with TBST and incubation with HRP-conjugated IgG (sheep anti-mouse second antibody), the proaerolysin-bound GPI anchored proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus kit, Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation of PrP from P2 fraction was performed as described (39Zou W.Q. Cashman N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43942-43947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies (8B4) at 100 μg were coupled to 7 × 108 tosyl activated magnetic Dynabeads in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5 (PBS) at 37 °C for 20 h, and the beads were then washed twice with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. The antibody-conjugated beads were incubated with 0.1% BSA, 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 at 37 °C for 4 h to block nonspecific binding sites, followed by two washes with 0.1% BSA in PBS. For immunoprecipitation of PrP, 100 μl of antibody-conjugated beads was incubated with 870 μl of lysis buffer in the presence of 30 μl of P2 fraction at room temperature for 3 h. The immune complex-containing beads were washed three times with washing buffer (2% Nonidet P 40 and 2% Tween-20 in PBS, pH 7.5). PK digestion and deglycosylation of PrP were performed as described above. Samples were mixed with 2× gel loading buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. PK-resistant C-terminal Fragments of PrP Are Present in sCJD Brains—We prepared the detergent-insoluble fraction from brains of 29 subjects affected by various subtypes of sCJD, which included five subtypes identified as MM1, VV1, MM2, MV2, and VV2 sCJD, according to the classification of Parchi et al. (40Parchi P. Giese A. Capellari S. Brown P. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Windl O. Zerr I. Budka H. Kopp N. Piccardo P. Poser S. Rojiani A. Streichemberger N. Julien J. Vital C. Ghetti B. Gambetti P. Kretzschmar H. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 224-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). These preparations were treated with PK and analyzed by Tris-Tricine gradient gels and immunoblotting using anti-C, an antibody to the C-terminal domain of PrP. Following this procedure, we observed two sets of PK-resistant PrP fragments (Fig. 1). The first set consisted of the well-known PrP27-30 (16Prusiner S.B. Groth D.F. Bolton D.C. Kent S.B. Hood L.E.

It migrated as three bands of 30-35, 27-28, and 19-21 kDa that correspond to N-terminally truncated forms of diglycosylated, monoglycosylated, and unglycosylated PrPSc, respectively. Unlike the PrP27-30, the second set of PK-resistant fragments migrated at ∼12 and ∼13 kDa, and were designated PrP C-terminal fragments 12/13 kDa (PrP-CTF 12/13) (Fig. 1). They varied considerably in amount and ratio among different subtypes of sCJD (Table I). In 26 of the 29 sCJD brains examined, PrP-CTF 12/13 accounted for up to 24% of all PK-resistant PrP fragments as measured by densitometry. The analysis of the ratio, which was examined in 13 cases, often showed a better representation of PrP-CTF13 than PrP-CTF12 but the opposite was occasionally true (Table I). The presence, amount and ratio varied from case to case and showed no apparent correlation with the amount of PrP27-30 and the sCJD subtype (Fig. 1 and Table I). In three cases, PrP-CTF 12/13 were present only in trace amounts as their detection required longer exposure of the immunoblots. The study of the brain distribution, carried out in 14 cases showed that PrP-CTF 12/13 generally were better represented in the neocortex than in the hippocampal formation and subcortical structures such as putamen, thalamus, and cerebellum.Table IPrP-CTF12/13 in various subtypes of sporadic CJD Shown are the presence and representation of PrP-CTF12/13 in fifteen cases of sporadic CJD, grouped by the status of polymorphism at codon 129 and type of PK-resistant PrPSc according to the classification of Parchi et al.

The relative abundance between the 13 and 12 kDa PrP-CTF is qualitatively indicated by + (less abundant) or ++ (more abundant) as estimated by visual inspection of immunoblots probed with anti-C antibody. Due to the closeness of the PrP-CTF12/13 bands, accurate quantitation became difficult and therefore was not attempted. In some cases, only trace amounts of PrP-CTF12/13 were detected following long exposure of immunoblots.CaseCodon 129PrPSc typeFragment (kDa)13121M/M1+++2M/M1+++3M/M1+++4V/V1+++5V/V1+++6V/V1Trace7M/M2+++8M/M2+++9M/M2Trace10V/V2+++11V/V2+++12V/V2Trace13M/V2+++14M/V2+++15M/V2+++ Open table in a new tab PrP-CTF12/13 Are Truncated Glycoforms of PrPSc—Because PrP contains two consensus sites for N-linked glycans at residues 181 and 197 that contributes to its heterogeneity (6Oesch B.

As shown in Fig. 2, PrP glycoforms were readily detectable in control brains, which upon deglycosylation, shifted mainly to a 27 kDa band corresponding to the full-length PrP and an 18 kDa band corresponding to an N-terminally truncated PrP fragment with an N terminus starting at residue 111/112, as characterized previously (29Chen S.G.

They were invariably sensitive to PK digestion as expected for normal PrPC. PrPCTF12/13 in the molecular mass range of 12 and 13 kDa were not detected in control brains with or without deglycosylation. PrP-CTF12/13 were barely detectable in untreated brain homogenates from sCJD subjects. However, PK treatment and removal of glycans with PNGase F independently resulted in a substantial increase in amount of PrP-CTF12/13 with the same gel mobility of 12 and 13 kDa as that observed following treatment with both PK and PNGase F (Fig. 2). These findings indicate that PrP-CTF12/13, like PrP27-30 (16Prusiner S.B. Groth D.F. Bolton D.C. Kent S.B. Hood L.E.

https://openalex.org/W2092544381,"The role of caspases and calpains in neurodegeneration remains unclear. In this study, we focused on these proteases in a rat model of Huntington's disease using the mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionic acid (3NP). Results showed that 3NP-induced death of striatal neurons was preceded by cytochrome c redistribution, transient caspase-9 processing, and activation of calpain, whereas levels of the active/processed form of caspase-3 remained low and were even reduced as compared with control animals. We evidenced here that this decrease in active caspase-3 levels could be attributed to calpain activation. Several observations supported this conclusion. 1) Pharmacological blockade of calpain in 3NP-treated rats increased the levels of endogenous processed caspase-9 and caspase-3. 2) Cell-free extracts prepared from the striatum of 3NP-treated rats degraded in vitro the p34 and p20 subunits of active recombinant caspase-9 and caspase-3, respectively. 3) This degradation of p34 and p20 could be mimicked by purified μ-calpain and was prevented by calpain inhibitors. 4) μ-Calpain produced a loss of the DEVDase (Asp-Glu-Val-Asp) activity of active caspase-3. 5) Western blot analysis and experiments with 35S-radiolabeled caspase-3 showed that μ-calpain cleaved the p20 subunit of active caspase-3 near its catalytic site. 6) μ-Calpain activity was selectively inhibited (IC50 of 100 μm) by a 12 amino acid peptide corresponding to the C terminus of p20. Our results showed that calpain can down-regulate the caspase-9/caspase-3 cell death pathway during neurodegeneration due to chronic mitochondrial defects in vivo and that this effect may involve, at least in part, direct cleavage of the caspase-3 p20 subunit.

HD is characterized by involuntary choreiform movements and cognitive deficits (3Harper P.S. Huntington's Disease. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1991Google Scholar). The most striking neuropathological characteristic of this disorder is preferential atrophy of the striatum due to death of medium size spiny neurons (3Harper P.S. Huntington's Disease. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1991Google Scholar). The involvement of excitotoxicity in HD was initially supported by observations that several histological and behavioral anomalies of HD can be mimicked in rats and non-human primates by intrastriatal injection of agonists of the glutamate receptors (4DiFiglia M. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 286-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), in particular quinolinate, an agonist of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors (5Beal M.F.

Observations using the mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionic acid (3NP), an irreversible inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase/complex II (16Coles C.J. Edmonson D.E. Singer T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 255: 772-4780Google Scholar), also support the so-called “indirect excitotoxic” hypothesis for HD. Indeed, chronic systemic administration of 3NP in rats and non-human primates produces homogenous blockade of complex II within the brain (17Brouillet E. Guyot M.C. Mittoux V. Altairac S. Condé F. Palfi S. Hantraye P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 794-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), leading to preferential excitotoxic striatal degeneration associated with behavioral abnormalities that are highly reminiscent of HD (18Beal M.F.

Dolan R. Guyot M.C. Peschanski M. Hantraye P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3019-3025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite numerous published studies, the cell death mechanisms underlying 3NP neurotoxicity in vivo are not fully understood (21Brouillet E. Condé F. Beal M.F. Hantraye P. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 59: 427-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). We recently examined the involvement of death proteases of the caspase family and Ca2+-activated neutral protease calpains in 3NP toxicity in rats (22Bizat N. Hermel J.M. Boyer F. Créminon C. Ouary S. Escartin C. Hantraye P. Krajewski S. Brouillet E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5020-5030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that when 3NP was administered to produce a chronic/steady mitochondrial perturbation, caspase-9 was transiently activated but surprisingly without being followed by an increased activation of caspase-3. In contrast, abnormal activation of the Ca2+-activated neutral protease calpain was observed in the striatum of 3NP-treated rats (22Bizat N. Hermel J.M. Boyer F. Créminon C. Ouary S. Escartin C. Hantraye P. Krajewski S. Brouillet E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5020-5030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as seen in the striatum of HD patients (23Gafni J. Ellerby L.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4842-4849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reasons that could account for the predominance of calpain over caspase-3 despite a transient activation of caspase-9 in the 3NP model of degeneration remained speculative assumptions (22Bizat N. Hermel J.M. Boyer F. Créminon C. Ouary S. Escartin C. Hantraye P. Krajewski S. Brouillet E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5020-5030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we further examined the mechanisms involved in the predominance of calpain over caspase-3 activation in the chronic 3NP model of HD. Because elegant experiments recently demonstrated the existence of a complex cross-talk between calpains and caspases (24Blomgren K. Zhu C. Wang X. Karlsson J.O. Leverin A.L. Bahr B.A. Mallard C.

Blood. 1999; 94: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that calpain could play an important role in the stoppage of the mitochondrial caspase pathway in this chronic 3NP lesion model. Using this model, we re-examined the time course of activation of calpain and caspase-9 and caspase-3 and we studied how calpain could modify the caspase-9/caspase-3 pathway in vivo and in vitro. We provide hereforth the biochemical and pharmacological evidences that in this model calpain inactivates the caspase-9/caspase-3 pathway through, at least partly, direct proteolysis of their active forms. In particular, calpain inactivates active caspase-3 by cleaving the C terminus domain of its p20 subunit. Animals—Because 3NP toxicity is age-dependent (28Brouillet E. Jenkins B. Hyman B. Ferrante R.J. Kowall N.W. Srivastava R. Roy D.S. Rosen B. Beal M.F. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 356-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), all of the experiments were carried out in 12-week-old male Lewis rats (IFFA Credo, L'Arbresle, France) weighing 340–370 g. Experimental procedures were performed in strict compliance with the recommendations of the European Community (86/609/EEC) and the French National Committee (87/848) for care and use of laboratory animals. Chemical and Reagents—All of the chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma unless specified. 3NP Treatment and Experimental Design—As described previously, a solution of 3NP was systemically delivered by chronic infusion (54 mg/kg/day) using osmotic mini-pumps (flow rate 10 μl/h, model 2ML1, Alzet Inc, Palo Alto, CA) placed subcutaneously in the back of the rats under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia (22Bizat N.

Brouillet E. Peschanski M. Hantraye P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4478-4486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control rats were sham-operated. Groups of rats (n = 5–8) were killed by decapitation at daily intervals (days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) after osmotic pump implantation (day 0). In one experiment, animals (n = 5/time point) were killed every 6 h from day 2 to 5. Motor Score—Animals were observed daily to detect the occurrence of motor symptoms. Each animal was scored using a neurological scale (normal = 0, very symptomatic = 8) as previously described (29Garcia M. Vanhoutte P. Pages C. Besson M.J. Brouillet E. Caboche J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2174-2184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Mittoux V. Ouary S. Monville C. Lisovoski F. Poyot T. Conde F. Escartin C. Robichon R. Brouillet E. Peschanski M. Hantraye P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4478-4486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calpain Inhibitor I Neuroprotection Experiments in the Chronic Model—The calpain inhibitor I (CI-1, z-Leu-Leu-Norleucinal, Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (40%) and diluted in phosphate-buffered saline was delivered (infusion rate 2.5 μg·μl–1·h–1) by intra-cerebroventricular infusion using an osmotic mini-pump (Model 2001, Alzet) connected to a stereotaxically implanted cannula (antero-posterior = –1.6 mm; lateral = 2.0 mm from Bregma; ventral = 3.5 mm from Dura; “brain infusion kit,” Alzet) (22Bizat N. Hermel J.M. Boyer F. Créminon C. Ouary S. Escartin C. Hantraye P. Krajewski S. Brouillet E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5020-5030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The osmotic pump delivering CI-1 and that delivering 3NP were implanted simultaneously. Biochemical analyses were performed on day 5 of the neurotoxic treatment. Brain Processing, Sample Dissection, and Homogenization—Brains were rapidly removed from the skull and cut vertically along the rostrocaudal axis into two hemispheres. The left hemisphere was fixed in Bouin's solution for 3 days and paraffin-embedded for immunohistochemical evaluation. Striatum samples were dissected from the right hemisphere and processed for biochemical analyses. Tissue dissection and processing were performed at 4 °C. The lateral striatum was dissected out of a 2-mm-thick coronal slice. Tissue samples (10–20 mg) were homogenized using a 1-ml glass Teflon potter (900 rpm, 20 strokes) in 300 μl of buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science). For cytochrome c (cyt c) redistribution studies, homogenization was performed in buffer A preserving mitochondria (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 60 mm sucrose, 210 mm mannitol, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm succinate, and 1 mm ADP). For evaluation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 and calpain activities during the course of the 3NP treatment, homogenization was performed in buffer B containing 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol as previously described (31Qin Z.H. Wang Y. Kikly K.K. Sapp E. Kegel K.B. Aronin N. DiFiglia M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8079-8086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Homogenate was first centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min, the resulting pellet containing the mitochondria fraction. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting high speed supernatant contained the cytosol fraction, whereas the high speed pellet contained the membrane fraction. In cell-free extract studies examining calpain/caspase cross-talk, fractions enriched in cytosol were prepared by homogenization in a buffer C containing 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.3 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA (22Bizat N. Hermel J.M. Boyer F. Créminon C. Ouary S. Escartin C. Hantraye P. Krajewski S. Brouillet E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5020-5030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min, giving a cell-free extract (supernatant) and a membrane-enriched fraction (pellet). This procedure led to essentially similar results in terms of protease activities when compared with the use of buffer B with a three-step centrifugation. All of the fractions were stored at –80 °C until analysis. Histological Studies—Hoechst nuclear staining with bis-benzimide H33258 and histochemistry for cyt c (primary antibody against cyt c, BD Biosciences) were performed on paraffin sections as described previously (22Bizat N. Hermel J.M. Boyer F. Créminon C. Ouary S. Escartin C. Hantraye P. Krajewski S. Brouillet E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5020-5030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Ellerby L.M.

Histochemistry of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) was performed and quantitatively analyzed according to previously published procedures (17Brouillet E. Guyot M.C. Mittoux V. Altairac S. Condé F. Palfi S. Hantraye P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 794-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 22Bizat N. Hermel J.M. Boyer F. Créminon C. Ouary S. Escartin C. Hantraye P. Krajewski S.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2174-2184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA method (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins in striatal samples were separated by SDS-PAGE as described previously (22Bizat N. Hermel J.M. Boyer F. Créminon C. Ouary S. Escartin C. Hantraye P. Krajewski S. Brouillet E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5020-5030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following blot transfer, nitrocellulose membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with one of the antibodies raised against the following: fodrin (1:2000, antibody against non-erythroid α-spectrin, Chemicon, Temecula, CA), cytochrome c (1:2000; BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), calbindin D28k (1:1000, monoclonal, Sigma), caspase-9 (1:1000, rabbit polyclonal Bur 81, Burnham Institute) (32Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Ellerby L.M. Welsh K. Xie Z. Deveraux Q.L. Salvesen G.S. Bredesen D.E. Rosenthal R.E. Fiskum G. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5752-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), and C-terminal domain of active caspase-3 p20 subunit (1:1000, rabbit polyclonal antibody 1797, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). After incubation with the primary antibody, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000, Sigma) and peroxidase activity was detected using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). For detection of active caspase-3 in cytosolic fractions of the striatum of 3NP-treated rats prepared by ultracentrifugation (see time-course study in Fig. 3), secondary antibody was used at 1:5000 dilution and peroxidase activity was detected using Femto-ECL reagent (Pierce). Oligonucleosome Detection—Oligonucleosome contents in soluble fractions (20 μl) were determined using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The results were normalized by the protein concentration in each sample and expressed as mean the optical density values ± S.E. Proteolytic Activity Assay Using Fluorogenic Substrate for Caspase and Calpain—The fluorescent assay of proteases is based on the cleavage of 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin (AMC) or 7-amino-4-trifluoro-methyl-coumarin (AFC) dyes from the C terminus of the peptide substrates (22Bizat N. Hermel J.M. Boyer F. Créminon C. Ouary S. Escartin C. Hantraye P. Krajewski S. Brouillet E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5020-5030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The calpain activity was determined using N-succinyl-Leu-Tyr-(N-succinyl-LY)-AMC, a substrate preferentially cleaved by μ-calpain and m-calpain (33McDonald M.C. Mota-Filipe H. Paul A. Cuzzocrea S. Adbelrahman M. Harwood S. Plevin R. Chatterje P.K. Yaqoob M.M. Thiemermann C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 171-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Calpain activity (Ca2+-dependent cleavage of N-succinyl-LY-AMC) present in cytosol fraction (10 μl containing ∼30 μg of protein) was determined as the difference between the calcium-dependent and the non-calcium-dependent fluorescence. The calcium-dependent fluorescence released was measured after a 30-min incubation at 37 °C in buffer D containing 63 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.3, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm CaCl2 and is attributable to the cleavage of 150 μm N-succinyl-LY-AMC. The non-calcium-dependent fluorescence was measured under the same conditions using buffer D without calcium and containing 1 mm EDTA and 10 mm EGTA. Using the fluorometric assay described above, we performed in vitro concentration-dependent inhibition experiments of calpain activity (purified μ-calpain, 0.2 units/well, Calbiochem) with the synthetic peptide corresponding to the 12 amino acids of the C terminus of caspase-3 p20 (Ct12p20, RGTELDCGIETD), a scramble peptide (ICDLGTEDRTEG), and a peptide with leucine 168 substituted by a lysine (Ct12p20-L168K, RGTEKDCGIETD) solubilized at 10 mm (90% pure) in water. Caspases-3, -8, and -9 activities were tested on peptidic substrates (Biomol) using, respectively, N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-AFC (DEVD-AFC), N-acetyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-AFC (IETD-AFC) and N-acetyl-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-AFC (LEHD-AFC). Soluble fractions (30 μg of protein) were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min in caspase buffer E (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 4 mm dithiothreitol) with 40 μm of the appropriate substrate. The nonspecific activity was measured in the presence of 10 μm of the appropriate caspase inhibitor i.e. the C-terminal aldehyde form (CHO) of the substrate (DEVD-CHO, IETD-CHO, and LEHD-CHO for caspases-3, -8 and –9, respectively). Fluorescence (excitation/emission: 400/505 nm for AFC and 380/460 nm for AMC) was measured in 96-well plates using a “Fusion” fluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Science). Enzyme activity was calculated using standard curves of AFC or AMC and expressed as the mean activity ± S.E. (picomole of AFC-AMC released·min–1·mg–1 protein). Degradation of Recombinant Caspases in Vitro and ex Vivo by Purified Calpain and Striatal Extracts from 3NP-treated Rats—We studied the in vitro proteolysis (1 h at 37 °C) of each recombinant human caspase (-3, -8, and -9) (50 ng for Western blot analysis and 10 ng for proteolysis activity assay, Biomol) by purified μ-calpain (0.2 units) in 100 μl of buffer D (with calcium). Cleavage of recombinant caspases was also studied after a 1-h incubation with cell-free extract of striatal homogenate from control or 3NP-treated rats (20 μg of protein). Digestion products were analyzed by 8–20% gradient SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. In addition, the functional effects of purified calpain and striatal extracts on recombinant caspases were quantitatively assessed by determining DEVDase and IETDase proteolytic activities related to active recombinant caspases-3 and -8, respectively. To detect the cleavage products of caspase-3 by calpain, we produced histidine-tagged and [35S]methionine-labeled procaspase-3 using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (TnT quick coupled transcription/translation system, Promega) and a pET-15b-procaspase-3 construct. The pET-15b-procaspase-3 construct was generated as described previously (34Cryns V.L. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Li H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 49: 31277-31282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (196) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled caspase-3 protein was digested with recombinant caspase-8 (50 ng, Biomol) for maturation into its active form containing the p20 subunit. 35S-Labeled p20 then was subjected to calpain digestion as described above. When stated, the calpain inhibitor CI-1 (10 μm) was added to the reaction. Reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Following treatment with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) and drying of gels, 35S-labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Statistical Analysis—Results were expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis included Student's t test or ANOVA followed by a post hoc Scheffé F-test (StatView, version 5.0, Berkeley, CA). Time Course of Behavioral, Histological, and Biochemical Changes Produced in the Striatum by Chronic 3NP Treatment—In agreement with previously reported experiments (22Bizat N. Hermel J.M. Boyer F.

Hantraye P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4478-4486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the onset of overt motor symptoms (bilateral dystonia, uncoordinated movements, bradykinesia, and gait abnormalities) occurred on day 3 of 3NP treatment (Fig. 1A). In the experiment presented in Fig 1A, symptoms worsened on day 4 and reached their maximal severity on day 5. The analysis of SDH activity in the brain showed that after day 3 constant administration of 3NP produced a partial and constant mitochondrial defect very similar to that observed in HD (Fig. 1B). Histological evaluation of the striatum at various times during 3NP treatment showed overt tissue abnormalities in all of the animals after day 4. The nuclei of striatal cells were often fragmented as seen with Hoechst staining (Fig. 1C). Consistent with this finding, cytosolic fraction of striatal homogenates showed significant elevations in free oligonucleosome levels, indicating DNA fragmentation beginning at day 4 + 12 h and continuing thereafter (Fig. 1D). We analyzed the “mitochondrial” apoptosis pathway in the striatum of 3NP-treated rats. The cellular distribution of cyt c in the striatum was modified during 3NP treatment as it is observed during apoptosis. Cyt c was barely detectable in the cytosolic fraction of striatal homogenates from control rats. In contrast, cytosol fraction from 3NP-treated rats showed a marked and transient increase in cyt c on day 2, i.e. 3 days before the onset of striatal degeneration (Fig. 2A). Consistent with this observation, immunohistochemistry of cyt c with Nissl counterstaining showed accumulation of immunoreactivity in the perikarya of neurons (Fig. 2B). We next assessed the occurrence of caspase-9 and -3 activation in the 3NP model. Striatal cytosolic fractions from animals on days 2 and 3 showed a slight increase in the zymogen (p46) and processed form of caspase-9 (p34) compared with the base-line levels observed in controls (Fig. 2C). Measurement of caspase-9-related LEHDase activity in the striatum of 3NP rats showed significant increase on day 3, consistent with a transient activation of caspase-9 (Fig. 2D). We next examined the status of caspase-3, which is activated downstream of caspase-9. Surprisingly, Western blot analysis showed an apparent loss of the active caspase-3 subunit p20 (seen as 17/19-kDa doublet) in the striatum of 3NP-treated animals on days 4 and 5 (Fig. 3A). In line with this finding, fluorometric measurements of DEVDase proteolytic activity in the striatal cytosolic fraction showed no activation of effector caspase-3 in 3NP-treated rats when compared with sham animals (Fig. 3B). Moreover, caspase-3-related proteolytic activity decreased during treatment (Fig. 3B). As reported previously (22Bizat N. Hermel J.M. Boyer F. Créminon C. Ouary S. Escartin C. Hantraye P. Krajewski S. Brouillet E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5020-5030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Western blot analysis for fodrin (non-erythroid α-spectrin), a known substrate of both caspase-3 and calpain (35Wang K.

J. 1986; 236: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In the mammalian central nervous system, CS-PGs are also expressed as abundant ECM molecules, and their spatiotemporal distributions have been well characterized (3Lander A.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 4Oohira A. Matsui F. Tokita Y. Yamauchi S. Aono S. Arch. Biochem.

Nieto-Sampedro M. Bovolenta P. J. Neurobiol. 1996; 30: 410-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although the biological significance of CS/DS constituents of CS-PGs has attracted little attention until recently, growing evidence suggests that some CS subtypes play crucial roles in various biological events, especially neural network formation (7Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 8Sugahara K. Yamada S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 321-349Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). CS is a linear polysaccharide chain comprised of repeating disaccharide units containing glucuronic acid (GlcUA) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues, whereas DS is a stereoisomeric form of CS with varying proportions of iduronic acid (IdoUA) in place of GlcUA. These polysaccharides are found in divergent organisms from worms to human. CS chains can be divided into several subclasses. Major CS chains found in mammalian tissues contain the monosulfated A disaccharide unit [GlcUA-GalNAc(4S)] and C unit [GlcUA-GalNAc(6S)]. On the other hand, significant and various proportions of the disulfated disaccharide units such as D unit [GlcUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S)] and E unit [GlcUA-GalNAc(4S,6S)], which are characteristic components in shark cartilage CS-D and squid cartilage CS-E, respectively, are detected in the brains of cattle (9Saigo K. Egami F. J. Neurochem. 1970; 17: 633-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), embryonic day 13 (E13) mice (10Zou P. Zou K. Muramatsu H. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Habuchi O. Ohtake S. Ikematsu S.

In addition, we have demonstrated that particular neurotrophic CS-PGs such as DSD-1-PG/6B4-PG/phosphacan purified from neonatal mouse brains (12Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C.

The proportions of these units developmentally change in the chick and mouse brain (16Maeda N. He J. Yajima Y. Mikami T. Sugahara K. Yabe T. J. Biol.

In contrast to CS chains, the presence and the possible functions of DS-type GAG chains containing IdoUA in the mammalian brain are poorly understood. CS-PGs and CS GAGs have been reported to inhibit neurite outgrowth in vitro (5Bandtlow C.E. Zimmermann D.R. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1267-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 19McKeon R.J.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8979-8989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This widely accepted concept is consistent with the recent findings that enzymatic degradation of CS chains permitted the axonal regeneration after a spinal cord injury (24Bradbury E.J. Moon L.D. Popat R.J. King V.R. Bennett G.S. Patel P.N. Fawcett J.W. McMahon S.B. Nature. 2002; 416: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar) and the reactivation of the ocular dominance plasticity in the adult visual cortex (25Pizzorusso T. Medini P. Berardi N. Chierzi S. Fawcett J.W. Maffei L. Science. 2002; 298: 1248-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). In strong contrast, DSD-1-PG stimulates neurite outgrowth of cultured rat hippocampal neurons through its CS side chains containing the unique structure (referred to as DSD-1 epitope), recognized by the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 473HD (12Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The 473HD-reactive epitope is also found in CS-C and oversulfated CS-D from shark cartilage, and the CS-D preparation itself exhibits neurite outgrowth-promoting activity (15Clement A.M. Nadanaka S. Masayama K. Mandl C. Sugahara K. Faissner A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28444-28453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 26Nadanaka S. Clement A.M. Masayama K. Faissner A. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3296-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Interestingly, another oversulfated CS variant, CS-E derived from squid cartilage, also enhances neurite extension but in a DSD-1 epitope-independent manner as revealed by the mAb 473HD-resistant property (27Clement A.M. Sugahara K. Faissner A. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 269: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Because CS-E interacts specifically with several heparin (Hep)-binding growth factors known as neurotrophic factors (28Deepa S.S. Umehara Y. Higashiyama S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43707-43716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), a possibility exists that the neurite outgrowth-promoting activities of such oversulfated CS variants may be elicited through their binding of Hep-binding growth factors. Oversulfated GAG chains, besides CS-D and CS-E, have been found abundantly in marine vertebrates and invertebrates. The oversulfated GAG termed CS-H, isolated from the hagfish notochord, has a unique oversulfated structure characterized by a major disaccharide H unit [IdoUA-GalNAc(4S,6S)] (29Anno K. Seno N. Mathews M.B. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 237: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Ueoka C. Nadanaka S. Seno N. Khoo K.H. Sugahara K. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and therefore is actually DS. The terminologies DS-E for this GAG and iE unit (where “i” stands for IdoUA) for the H disaccharide unit have been proposed (8Sugahara K. Yamada S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 321-349Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The bodies of ascidians (Chordate-Tunicate) from various species are rich sources of oversulfated DS chains with different sulfation profiles. For example, the DS preparations from Ascidia nigra and Styela plicata have high contents of distinctive disaccharide units, [IdoUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S)] (iD unit) (66%) or [IdoUA(2S)-GalNAc(4S)] (B unit) (90%), respectively (31Pavão M.S.

Recent studies have demonstrated that embryonic sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus produces oversulfated DS chains composed primarily of the iE disaccharide unit [IdoUA-GalNAc(4S,6S)] (74%), and the degree of the 4-O-sulfation is decreased markedly in the adult sea urchin (33Vilela-Silva A.C. Werneck C.C. Valente A.P. Vacquier V.D. Mourão P.A. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (see Table I). Although some of these DS preparations exert anticoagulant activity (31Pavão M.S. Mourão P.A. Mulloy B. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol.

J. 1988; 254: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we have shown that DS-E/CS-H derived from hagfish notochord interacts significantly with a Hep-binding neuroregulatory factor midkine (MK) in vitro and inhibits MK-mediated neural adhesion similarly to CS-E (11Ueoka C.

Thus, various above-mentioned oversulfated DS preparations may exert neurite outgrowth-promoting activity as in the case of oversulfated CS variants. Here, we assessed neurite outgrowth-promoting activities of these DS variants toward cultured E16 mouse hippocampal neurons and investigated the involvement of IdoUA-containing DS-type structures in the neuritogenic properties. The preliminary findings were reported in abstract form (35Hikino M. Mikami T. Faissner A. Vilela-Silva A.C. Pavão M.S. Sugahara K.

The purified DSD-1-PG was prepared from postnatal day 1 and postnatal day 15 mouse brains as described previously (12Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Enzymatic Treatment—Enzymatic digestion with chondroitinases ABC, AC-I, AC-II, or B was carried out using 5 μg of each CS/DS polymer or 5 μg (as GAG polysaccharide) of DSD-1-PG and 7 mIU of each chondroitinase in a total volume of 50 μl of the appropriate buffer at 37 °C (or 30 °C for digestion with chondroitinase B) for 60 min as described previously (36Sugahara K. Ohkita Y. Shibata Y. Yoshida K. Ikegami A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7204-7212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A highly purified preparation of chondroitinase ABC was used only for a digestion of DSD-1-PG in place of the conventional preparation. After incubation, the reaction mixture was boiled at 100 °C for 1 min. The two-fifths volume (corresponding to 2 μg of GAG) of each mixture was used for a cell culture substrate described below. Preparation of Substrates—Plastic coverslips (10 × 10 mm) were precoated with 1.5 μg/ml poly-dl-ornithine (P-ORN) (molecular weight > 30,000; catalog number P-0671; Sigma) in 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 8.1, for 2 h at room temperature and then coated with various CS/DS polysaccharides (2 μg/coverslip) or their enzymatic digests diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C overnight unless indicated elsewhere (see “Results”). Laminin (2–10 μg/coverslip), DSD-1-PG (2 μg/coverslip as GAG polysaccharide), and its preparations pretreated with chondroitinases in PBS were also coated on the P-ORN-precoated substratum. Cell Culture—Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were established from E16 mouse brains as described previously (15Clement A.M. Nadanaka S. Masayama K. Mandl C. Sugahara K. Faissner A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28444-28453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The hippocampi were dissected from E16 mouse embryos, and the hippocampal blocks were washed 10 times with Hanks' balanced salt solution and dissociated with 0.25% (w/v) trypsin in the same Hanks' solution for 10 min at 37 °C followed by a series of gentle triturations. The single cells were resuspended with the culture medium, Eagle's minimum essential medium containing N2 supplements (Invitrogen, Tokyo, Japan), 0.1 mm pyruvate, 0.1% (w/v) ovalbumin, 0.029% l-glutamine, 0.2% sodium hydrogen carbonate, and 5 mm HEPES and plated at a cell density of 10,000 cells/cm2 on coverslips precoated with a defined substrate. Such cultures were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a tissue culture incubator. After 24 h in culture, the cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 30 min, washed three times with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were immunostained with anti-microtuble-associated protein 2 after 100-fold dilution (Leico Technologies Inc., St. Louis, MO) (37Caceres A. Banker G.A. Binder L. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 714-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and anti-neurofilament after 250-fold dilution (Sigma) (38Debus E. Weber K. Osborn M.

At least three independent experiments were carried out for each culture condition. Analysis of Neuronal Morphology—The immunostained cells on each coverslip were scanned and digitalized with a ×20 objective on an optical microscope (BH-2; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a digital camera (HC-300Z/OL; Olympus). The photographs were analyzed using morphological analysis software (Mac SCOPE; Mitani Corp., Tokyo, Japan). In morphometric analysis, only the clearly isolated neurons with at least one process being longer than a cell body diameter were chosen at random. The length of the longest neurite and the number of the primary neurites were determined by drawing and counting the corresponding neurite(s), respectively, of at least 100 neurons on duplicate coverslips of each substrate condition per experiment. The surface area of neuronal soma (μm2) was also measured as the criterion of cell adhesion. Analysis of the 2AB Derivatives of Chondroitinase Digests Prepared from the CS Chains of DSD-1-PG—DSD-1-PG (2 μg as GlcUA) was incubated with 6 mIU of chondroitinase B (a native or heat-inactivated preparation) in a total volume of 60 μl at 30 °C for 60 min as described above. The samples were dried in a vacuum concentrator and derivatized with 2AB, and the excess 2AB reagent was removed by paper chromatography (39Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The three-fifths volume of the 2AB derivative was subsequently digested with 5 mIU of chondroitinase AC-I in a total volume of 20 μl at 37 °C for 60 min. Each 2AB derivative corresponding to a one-eighth volume of the starting material was analyzed using anion exchange HPLC on an amine-bound silica PA-03 column (4.6 × 250 mm; YMC Co., Kyoto, Japan) with a linear gradient of NaH2PO4 from 16 to 530 mm over 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (39Kinoshita A.

Oversulfated DS-E/CS-H Stimulates Neurite Outgrowth of Cultured Mouse Hippocampal Neurons—Previous observations suggested that oversulfated CS variants such as CS-D and CS-E can promote neurite outgrowth of E18 rat hippocampal neurons (15Clement A.M.

https://openalex.org/W2030209853,"Lack of Cdk4 expression in mice leads to insulin-deficient diabetes and female infertility owing to a reduced number of pancreatic β cells and prolactin-producing pituitary lactotrophs, respectively. Cdk4 null mice display also reduced body and organ size. Here, we show that Cdk4 is essential for the postnatal proliferation of pancreatic β cells but not for embryonic neogenesis from ductal epithelial cells. Re-expression of endogenous Cdk4 in β cells and in the pituitary gland of Cdk4 null mice restores cell proliferation and results in fertile and normoglycemic animals, thus, demonstrating that the proliferation defects in these cellular populations are cell autonomous because of the lack of Cdk4 expression. However, these mice remain small in size, indicating that this phenotype is not because of pancreatic- or pituitary-mediated endocrine defects. This phenotype is a consequence of reduced cell numbers rather than reduced cell size. Thus, mammalian Cdk4 is not only involved in controlling proliferation of specific cell types but may play a wider role in establishing homeostatic cell numbers."

Signal from the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) 1The abbreviations used are: TGFβ, transforming growth factor-β; NLS, nuclear localization signal; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; HA, hemagglutinin; MBP, maltose-binding protein. cytokines originates at the cell surface upon engagement of TGFβ ligands with their corresponding Type I/Type II receptor complexes and is transduced into the nucleus by the family of Smad proteins (1Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar). Smad proteins are phosphorylated by the corresponding receptor kinases activated upon ligand binding: Smad2 and Smad 3 by TGFβ and activin receptors; Smads 1, 5, and 8 by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptors. One key event accompanying ligand binding is the rapid movement of Smads, including the unphosphorylated Smad4, into the nucleus. As transcription factors, these nuclear-bound Smads activate or repress gene expression leading to diverse cellular responses to TGFβ cytokines (2Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 3Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2092) Google Scholar). Translocation of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope occurs via the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which consists of over 20 nucleoporins and many of them contain multiple phenylalanine-glycine (FG) dipeptide repeats (4Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 5Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

In many cases, movement of cargo molecules through the NPC is mediated by the importin β family of transport receptors, which bind cargo molecules and the FG dipeptide repeats simultaneously through separate domains (7Weis K. Cell. 2003; 112: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). In the case of classical nuclear localization signal (NLS)-containing proteins, importin α bridges the interaction between the NLS motif and importin β (4Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 5Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 6Nakielny S.

Cell. 2003; 112: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Another common element in importin β-mediated nuclear import is the small GTPase Ran in its GTP-bound form (RanGTP), whose binding to importin β disrupts all characterized association between importin β and their cargoes (4Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 5Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Cell. 2003; 112: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Ran is mostly in its GTP-bound form in the nucleus and a GDP-bound form in the cytoplasm. Such Ran-GTP gradient across the nuclear envelope prompts release of cargo only in the nucleoplasm, ensuring that the cargoes will accumulate in the nucleus (4Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev.

Since elucidation of the mechanism of importin β-mediated nuclear import, there have been efforts to investigate if similar principles apply to Smads. In Smad3, the N-terminal or MH1 domain contains a lysine-rich α-helix, which was suggested to interact with importin β and act as a NLS (8Xiao Z. Liu X. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23425-23428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9Kurisaki A. Kose S. Yoneda Y. Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This interaction between importin β and the Smad3 MH1 domain appeared to be dependent on phosphorylation of the Smad3 C terminus in response to TGFβ (8Xiao Z. Liu X. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23425-23428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9Kurisaki A. Kose S. Yoneda Y. Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Nuclear entry of Smad4 occurs in response to TGFβ signals, yet unlike Smad2 and Smad3 it is not phosphorylated (10Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massaguè J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Smad4 contains a typical NES motif and is subject to strong nuclear export by the export receptor CRM-1 (11Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 12Pierreux C.E. Nicolas F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9041-9054Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 13Watanabe M. Masuyama N. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A lysine-rich motif present in the Smad4 MH1 domain was recently proposed to function as a bipartite NLS motif for interaction with importin α and facilitating nuclear import of Smad4 (14Xiao Z. Latek R. Lodish H.F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1057-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast to the proposed involvement of importins in nuclear import of Smad3 and Smad4, studies on Smad2 have shown that its behavior in nuclear import assays is distinct from that of a classical NLS-containing substrate as it depends on direct interaction with FG-repeat containing nucleoporins without importin α or importin β as the bridging factor (15Xu L. Chen Y.G. Massague J. Nat Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 16Xu L. Kang Y. Col S. Massague J. Mol Cell. 2002; 10: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). TGFβ promotes Smad2 nuclear import by attenuating its association with cytoplasmic retention factors while enhancing its affinity for nuclear retention factors, without affecting Smad2 affinity for nucleoporins (16Xu L. Kang Y. Col S. Massague J. Mol Cell. 2002; 10: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigate the nuclear import mechanisms of Smad3 and Smad4, using an in vitro nuclear import assay. Our observations using this assay suggest that nuclear import of Smad3 and Smad4 is mediated by mechanisms independent of importin β or importin α. The nuclear import capability of Smad3 is intrinsic, and does not require its phosphorylation by TGFβ receptors. Similar to Smad2, it is the C-terminal MH2 domain of Smad3 that contains the major nuclear import activity, owing to the presence of a series of hydrophobic surface structures (referred to as the hydrophobic corridor) that allow direct contact with FG-repeat containing nucleoporins including CAN/Nup214 and Nup153. While full-length Smad4 is also capable of interaction with nucleoporins and undergoes importin-independent nuclear import, neither its MH1 nor MH2 domain in isolation is sufficient for robust nucleoporin contact and nuclear import. We conclude that distinct structural entities in Smad3 and Smad4 mediate contact with the NPC and drive nuclear import. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Reporter Assays—Hela, HaCaT, and COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and L17 cells were cultured in MEM. In all cases, the media was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin and fungizone. All transient transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine following the manufacturer's manual (Invitrogen). Luciferase reporter assays were carried out as previously described, with constitutively active Renilla reporter as the internal control (16Xu L. Kang Y. Col S. Massague J. Mol Cell. 2002; 10: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Plasmids and Mutagenesis—Full-length Smad3 with FLAG tag at its N terminus was cloned into the pQE80 vector to generate His-Flag-Smad3 (Qiagen). His-Smad4 was constructed by inserting full-length Smad4 into the pQE30 vector (Qiagen). Fragments corresponding to amino acids 1-155 and 146-425 of Smad3 were inserted into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of pGEX 4T1 (Amersham Biosciences) to create GST-S3MH1 and GST-S3(L-MH2), respectively. GST-S4MH1 and GST-S4(L-MH2) contain amino acids 1-145 and 145-552 of Smad4, respectively, and were cloned into the pGEX 4T1 vector. GST-GFP-S3MH1 was described previously (9Kurisaki A. Kose S. Yoneda Y. Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The L-MH2 fragment of Smad3 was inserted into pC2EGFP (Clontech) by PCR cloning to generate GFP-S3(L-MH2). Plasmids encoding importin α, importin β, Ran, RanQ69L, were gifts from Dr. Dirk Gorlich (ZMBH, Heidelberg, Germany), and plasmids for NLS-GST-GFP and His-NTF2 were obtained from Dr. Gunter Blobel (Rockefeller University). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) Protein Labeling—Purified recombinant proteins were labeled with fluoresceince-5-maleimid or Texas Red C2 maleimide (Molecular Probes), using protocols recommended by the manufacturer. The labeled proteins were exchanged into the desired buffer using Econo-Pac 10 DG columns (Bio-Rad). Nuclear Import Assay—Permeabilization of Hela cells using digitonin, and the in vitro nuclear import assays were carried out as previously described (17Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In cases where cytosol was needed, rabbit reticulocyte lysate or Hela cytosol at 5-10 mg/ml were used as the source of importin α and importin β (17Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 18Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). In assays where SARA-SBD was used, the procedure was as described previously (15Xu L. Chen Y.G. Massague J. Nat Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In import reactions reconstituted with recombinant factors, purified importin α and importin β at indicated concentrations were used, together with RanGDP (5 μm) and NTF2 (2.5 μm). An ATP-regenerating system containing 0.02 unit/μl creatine kinase (Sigma), 1 mm ATP (Sigma), and 5 mm phosphocreatine was present in all import reactions. Immunostaining after the nuclear import assays was conducted as described previously (15Xu L. Chen Y.G. Massague J. Nat Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Protein-Protein Interaction Assays—GST pull-down experiments were performed as described previously (16Xu L. Kang Y. Col S. Massague J. Mol Cell. 2002; 10: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To test Smad2-Smad4 interactions, L17 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-Smad2 and HA-Smad4. As indicated, the cells were also transfected with the constitutively active TβRI(T204D) or the kinase-defective TβRI(K232R) (19Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massaguè J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and whole cell lysate was prepared by sonication in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.15% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation was done using agarose beads conjugated with the M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Generating Smad3-depleted HaCaT Cell Line by RNA Interference—To generate pSUPER-Smad3, the pSUPER vector (Dr. R. Agami, the Netherlands Cancer Institute) was digested with BglII and HindIII and the annealed oligos (5′-gatccccCGTCAACACCAAGTGCATC ttcaagagaGATGCACTTGGTGTTGACGtttttggaaa-3′ and 5′-agcttttccaaaaaCGTCAACACCAAGTGCATCtctcttgaa GATGCACTTGGTGTTGACGggg-3′) were ligated into the vector (20Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). The 19-nt Smad3 target sequence corresponds to amino acids 175-196. HaCaT cells were co-transfected with pSUPER-Smad3 and pPur (Clontech) vectors at the ratio of 5:1 using Lipofectamine as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). At 24-h post-transfection, the medium was changed with addition of 1 μg/ml puromycin to start selection. Extract prepared from selected clones was examined by immunoblotting using anti-Smad2/3, antiSmad3 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and anti-tubulin (Santa Cruz) antibodies. Nuclear Import of Smad3 and Smad4 Is Independent of Added Cytosol—We evaluated nuclear import of recombinant full-length Smad3 and Smad4 using the in vitro nuclear import assay (17Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Cytosol-independent nuclear accumulation of purified His-FLAG-Smad3 and His-Smad4 was observed, and inclusion of cytosol did not further enhance the efficiency of nuclear import (Fig. 1, A and B). In fact, there was a slight decrease in Smad4 nuclear import when cytosol was present (Fig. 1B). This could be due to the presence in cytosol of Smad4 retention factors or CRM-1, which exports Smad4 out of the nucleus (12Pierreux C.E. Nicolas F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9041-9054Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 13Watanabe M. Masuyama N. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Results in Fig. 1, A and B are in complete contrast to the cytosol-dependent nuclear import of the classical NLS-containing protein NLS-GST-GFP (Fig. 1C). Like all known active nuclear transport events, import of Smad3 and Smad4 in this assay was completely blocked by wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) regardless of the presence or absence of cytosol, suggesting that the observed nuclear import was an active process involving contact with nucleoporins (Fig. 1, A and B and data not shown) (17Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This observation also supports the conclusion that for both Smad3 and Smad4, nuclear import in the presence or absence of cytosol is mechanistically similar. The Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) protein is a cytoplasmic Smad retention factor that specifically binds to Smad2 and Smad3 by contacting the hydrophobic corridor on the MH2 domain (21Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 22Wu G. Chen Y.G. Ozdamar B. Gyuricza C.A. Chong P.A. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Shi Y. Science. 2000; 287: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Nuclear import of Smad3 was greatly diminished in the presence of the Smad-binding domain of SARA (SARA-SBD, amino acids 665-750 of SARA) (Fig. 1A). In contrast, SARA-SBD did not interfere with nuclear import of Smad4 (Fig. 1B), which is consistent with the fact that Smad4 does not interact with SARA (21Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). In the control experiment, NLS-driven nuclear import of NLS-GST-GFP was not affected by SARA-SBD (Fig. 1C), further supporting the specificity of SARA in blocking Smad3 nuclear import. The L-MH2 Domain Harbors the Major Nuclear Import Activity of Smad3—GST fusion of the L-MH2 domain of Smad3 (amino acids 146-425), but not the MH1 domain (amino acids 1-155), displayed cytosol-independent nuclear import activity (Fig. 2A). Since the MH2 domain mediates SARA-SBD interaction, this observation suggested that SARA-SBD may inhibit Smad3 nuclear import by occluding the MH2 domain (Fig. 1A). However, neither the MH1 (amino acids 1-145) nor the L-MH2 (amino acids 145-552) domain of Smad4 exhibited significant nuclear import activity (Fig. 2B). The lack of nuclear import of Smad4 MH1 domain is not due to the presence of an NES in this construct, since inhibition of the NES by leptomycin B (LMB) did not enable nuclear accumulation of Smad4 MH1 (data not shown). We tested additional Smad4 L-MH2 constructs (amino acids 251-552 and 285-552), and the results were all negative (data not shown). Thus it appears that although the MH2 domain of Smad4 is similar to that of Smad2 and Smad3 (∼40% sequence identity), different structural elements are responsible for Smad4 nuclear import. The observation that the nuclear import activity of Smad3 resides in its L-MH2 domain differs from a previous report (9Kurisaki A. Kose S. Yoneda Y. Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We sought to clarify this issue by examining the exact constructs used in the study by Kurisaki et al. (9Kurisaki A. Kose S. Yoneda Y. Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In contrast to that report, only a very small proportion of nuclei imported the MH1-containing construct GST-GFP-S3MH1 in the import assay, even with cytosol present (Fig. 3A). We also observed only weak import activity in the MH2-containing construct GST-S3 (231-425) (Fig. 3A), which is similar to previously described observation using this construct (9Kurisaki A. Kose S. Yoneda Y. Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, a much stronger import was seen with the GST-S3(L-MH2) (amino acids 145-425) construct (Fig. 3A), which included the complete MH2 domain (amino acids 219-425) as defined by crystal structure, not sequence homology (23Qin B.Y. Lam S.S. Correia J.J. Lin K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1950-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This conclusion is further substantiated by the observation in HaCaT and Hela cells that the L-MH2 domain of Smad3 can drive the heterologous protein GFP into the nucleus in the absence of TGFβ stimulation (Fig. 3B). Moreover, when tested simultaneously on the same cells, GST-S3(L-MH2) was imported very efficiently, whereas GST-GFP-S3MH1 was mostly excluded from the same nuclei (Fig. 3C). Consistent with these results, excess amount of the L-MH2 domain but not the MH1 domain inhibited the import of full-length Smad3 (Fig. 3D), supporting the conclusion that the major nuclear import activity in Smad3 is located in its C-terminal L-MH2 domain. Furthermore, just like full-length Smad3, nuclear import of GST-S3(L-MH2) is also blocked by SARA-SBD (data not shown), suggesting that L-MH2 is the domain through which full-length Smad3 gets imported into the nucleus. Nuclear Import of Smad2, -3, and -4 Is Independent of the Importin β Family—Our observations in Fig. 1 implied that cytosol, which is used as the source of importin β in these assays (17Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), was not essential for nuclear import of Smad3 and Smad4. This behavior is similar to that of Smad2 in previous reports (15Xu L. Chen Y.G. Massague J. Nat Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, residual importin β factors may still be present after digitonin treatment and contribute to nuclear import. Therefore, we decided to investigate this possibility. RanQ69L, a RanGTPase mutant defective in GTPase activity and therefore remains stably bound to GTP, effectively blocks importin β-dependent nuclear import by dissociating importin β family members from their cargoes (24Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 25Gorlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). This provides a rigorous test of whether nuclear import of Smad2, -3, and -4 is independent of importin β. Indeed, the presence of excess RanQ69L-GTP did not interfere with nuclear import of the l-MH2 domain of both Smad2 and Smad3, either in the presence or absence of cytosol (Fig. 4). Nuclear import of Smad4 was also not affected by RanQ69L (Fig. 4). The efficacy of the RanQ69L protein was confirmed, as it substantially inhibited nuclear import of importin α, which is an importin β-dependent process (Fig. 4) (25Gorlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). These results further validate our conclusion that nuclear import of Smad2, -3, and -4 does not require importin β family of transport receptors. Artificially High Concentration of Importins Are Required for the Nuclear Import of MH1 Domains of Smads—Previous reports have suggested that the MH1 domain of Smad3 interacts with importin β1 (8Xiao Z. Liu X. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23425-23428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9Kurisaki A. Kose S. Yoneda Y. Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It was also reported that the Smad4 MH1 domain is able to interact with importin α (14Xiao Z. Latek R. Lodish H.F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1057-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether such interactions would result in nuclear import of Smad3 and Smad4 respectively, we compared their behavior in the nuclear import assay with importin α as a typical cargo of importin β, and NLS-GST-GFP as a typical cargo of importin α. The amount of endogenous importin β in the Hela cytosol we used was sufficient to support nuclear entry of importin α, but not enough to import the MH1 domain of Smad3 (Fig. 5A). In order to achieve higher relative concentration of importin β in the import reaction, instead of cytosol, we used purified recombinant importin β, RanGDP, and NTF2 to reconstitute nuclear import as described previously (9Kurisaki A. Kose S. Yoneda Y. Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 26Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Only under these conditions, with concentration of importin β in the micromolar range and a high ratio of importin β to Smad3MH1(up to 2 importin β molecules per GST-GFP-S3MH1), did we observe nuclear import of the Smad3 MH1 domain (Fig. 5A, lower). In contrast, at the lowest importin β concentration, nuclear import of importin α already reached the plateau (Fig. 5A, upper). Similarly, endogenous importin α in cytosol allowed efficient nuclear import of NLS-GST-GFP, but was not sufficient for import of the MH1 domain of Smad4 (Fig. 5B). In the reconstituted import assay with recombinant import factors, at the lowest concentration of importin α, nuclear import of NLS-GST-GFP already reached the maximum (Fig. 5B, upper), while we detected little import of Smad4 MH1 domain (Fig. 5B, lower). Only when importin α was increased to micromolar range in the reconstituted assay did the MH1 domain of Smad4 start to be imported into the nucleus (Fig. 5B, lower). The higher the importin α concentration we used, the higher the percentage of nuclei that imported the Smad4 MH1 domain (Fig. 5B, lower). These observations suggest that while the Smad3 MH1 domain can interact with recombinant importin β and the Smad4 MH1 domain with recombinant importin α, the nature of such interactions is such that an artificially high concentration of the importins is required for nuclear import of these proteins in the nuclear import assays. Smad3 and Smad4 Interact with FG-containing Nucleoporins—A series of hydrophobic surface elements on the MH2 domain of Smad2 mediate the interaction with SARA-SBD, as revealed by the crystal structure of the SARA-SBD bound to this MH2 domain (22Wu G. Chen Y.G. Ozdamar B. Gyuricza C.A. Chong P.A. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Shi Y. Science. 2000; 287: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). These surface elements of Smad2, referred to as the hydrophobic corridor, were shown to interact with the FG-repeat region of both CAN/Nup214 and Nup153, and such interaction is critical for nuclear import of Smad2 (16Xu L. Kang Y. Col S. Massague J. Mol Cell. 2002; 10: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The MH2 domain of Smad2 and Smad3 share 92% amino acid sequence identity and a very similar structure as revealed by x-ray crystal analyses (22Wu G. Chen Y.G. Ozdamar B. Gyuricza C.A. Chong P.A. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Shi Y. Science. 2000; 287: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 23Qin B.Y. Lam S.S. Correia J.J. Lin K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1950-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic corridor is highly conserved in Smad3, but not Smad4, which is more divergent from Smad2 and Smad3 (Fig. 6A) (23Qin B.Y. Lam S.S. Correia J.J. Lin K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1950-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 27Qin B. Lam S.S. Lin K. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 1493-1503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The results from our import assays raised the possibility that similar to Smad2, direct contact with nucleoporins facilitates the importin-independent nuclear import of Smad3 and Smad4. Indeed, recombinant MBP-fused FG-repeat domain of CAN/Nup214 (amino acids 1805-2091) (MBP-CAN) interacted with the full-length Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4, with comparable affinity in a pull-down assay (Fig. 6B). We tested GST fusions of the MH1 and L-MH2 domains of Smad2, -3, and -4 for their ability to interact with the FG-repeats of CAN/Nup214 (HA-CAN1600, amino acids 1600-2091). The L-MH2 domain of Smad3, which is nearly identical to that of Smad2, was able to bind HA-CAN1600 (Fig. 6C). Only weak binding to HA-CAN1600 was detected with the L-MH2 domains of Smad4, and almost no binding with any of the MH1 domains (Fig. 6C). Therefore for all the tested constructs, their affinity for CAN/Nup214 correlates well with their activity in nuclear import assays. Two point mutations in the hydrophobic corridor of Smad3, V356R and W406A, resulted in much decreased affinity for FG-repeat region of CAN/Nup214 (HA-CAN1600) and Nup153 (HA-Nup153C, aa1156-1476) (Fig. 7A). More importantly, these mutations also resulted in compromised nuclear import activity (Fig. 7B). As a comparison, the P403H mutation, which is located outside of the hydrophobic corridor (Fig. 6A), did not affect Smad3 interaction with the nucleoporins and did not weaken Smad3 nuclear import either (Fig. 7, A and B). These effects are similar to those of the corresponding mutations in Smad2 (16Xu L. Kang Y. Col S. Massague J. Mol Cell. 2002; 10: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus ("
https://openalex.org/W2074970823,"The BRAF gene, encoding a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, is mutated in several human cancers, with the highest incidence occurring in cutaneous melanoma. The activating V599E mutation accounted for 80% of all mutations detected in cutaneous melanoma cell lines. Reconstitution experiments have shown that this mutation increases ectopically expressed B-Raf kinase activity and induces NIH3T3 cell transformation. Here we used tumor-derived cell lines to characterize the activity of endogenous mutated B-Raf protein and assess its specific role in transformation. We show that three cell lines (OCM-1, MKT-BR, and SP-6.5) derived from human choroidal melanoma, the most frequent primary ocular neoplasm in humans, express B-Raf containing the V599E mutation. These melanoma cells showed a 10-fold increase in endogenous B-RafV599E kinase activity and a constitutive activation of the MEK/ERK pathway that is independent of Ras. This, as well as melanoma cell proliferation, was strongly diminished by siRNA-mediated depletion of the mutant B-Raf protein. Moreover, blocking B-RafV599E-induced ERK activation by different experimental approaches significantly reduced cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of melanoma cells. Finally, quantitative immunoblot analysis allowed us to identify signaling and cell cycle proteins that are differentially expressed between normal melanocytes and melanoma cells. Although the expression of signaling molecules was not sensitive to U0126 in melanoma cells, the expression of a cluster of cell cycle proteins remained regulated by the B-RafV599E/MEK/ERK pathway. Our results pinpoint this pathway as an important component in choroidal melanoma cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1982260888,"The replication of most positive-strand RNA viruses and retroviruses is regulated by proteolytic processing. Alphavirus replicase proteins are synthesized as a polyprotein, called P1234, which is cleaved into nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4 by the carboxyl-terminal protease domain of nsP2. The cleavage intermediate P123+nsP4 synthesizes minus-strand copies of the viral RNA genome, whereas the completely processed complex is required for plus-strand synthesis. To understand the mechanisms responsible for this sequential proteolysis, we analyzed <i>in vitro</i> translated Semliki Forest virus polyproteins containing noncleavable processing sites or various deletions. Processing of each of the three sites <i>in vitro</i> required a different type of activity. Site 3/4 was cleaved <i>in trans</i> by nsP2, its carboxyl-terminal fragment Pro39, and by all polyprotein proteases. Site 1/2 was cleaved <i>in cis</i> with a half-life of about 20–30 min. <i>S</i>ite 2/3 was cleaved rapidly <i>in trans</i> but only after release of nsP1 from the polyprotein exposing an ""activator"" sequence present in the amino terminus of nsP2. Deletion of amino-terminal amino acids of nsP2 or addition of extra amino acid residues to its amino terminus specifically inhibited the protease activity that processes the 2/3 site. This sequence of delayed processing of P1234 would explain the accumulation of P123 plus nsP4, the early short-lived minus-strand replicase. The polyprotein stage would allow correct assembly and membrane association of the RNA-polymerase complex. Late in infection free nsP2 would cleave at site 2/3 yielding P12 and P34, the products of which, nsP1–4, are distributed to the plasma membrane, nucleus, cytoplasmic aggregates, and proteasomes, respectively."

The tumor cells interact with the ECM through the integrin family of cell surface adhesion receptors. The integrins provide direct links with the ECM, functioning as bidirectional transducers of extra- and intracellular signals, and thus potentially modulating tumor cell invasion (1Akiyama S.K. Olden K. Yamada K.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 173-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Integrins recognize the surrounding ECM and transmit messages to tumor cells, leading to degradation of ECM barriers and promoting tumor invasion.Changes in the expression of integrins have been observed in different malignant cell types (2Plantefaber L.C. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1989; 56: 281-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). For example, Rhabdomyosarcoma cells that express increased levels of integrin α2β1 have increased metastatic potential (3Chan B.M. Matsuura N. Takada Y. Zetter B.R. Hemler M.E. Science. 1991; 251: 1600-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Rodent cells transformed by Rous sarcoma virus express reduced levels of α5β1 (2Plantefaber L.C. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1989; 56: 281-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), and highly metastatic murine melanoma cells express increased levels of αvβ3 (4Li X. Chen B. Blystone S.D. McHugh K.P. Ross F.P. Ramos D.M. Invasion Metastasis. 1998; 18: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).

Virology. 1997; 239: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). More recently, a number of pathological studies have shown that αvβ6 expression is correlated with the progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumor (6Regezi J.A. Ramos D.M. Pytela R.

Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Two possible mechanisms by which integrins activate SFKs have been proposed (10Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar, 11Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 12Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5501-5509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). One proposed mechanism is FAK-dependent. In this model, the activation of FAK at Tyr-397 by some integrins creates a binding site for the Src homology 2 domain of SFKs and subsequently activates the bound SFKs (13Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). The activated SFKs in turn phosphorylate FAK at Tyr-576, Tyr-577, and Tyr-925, which ultimately leads to activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway. Another proposed mechanism of SFK activation is FAK-independent. Upon activation of integrins, Src is activated by dephosphorylation of Tyr-527 and thus phosphorylates many signaling proteins, including FAK, Cas, and Paxillin (14Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C.

Each experiment was repeated in triplicate wells, and within each well counting was done in four randomly selected microscopic fields (×300 magnification).Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and in Vitro Kinase Assay—The cells were serum-starved overnight and harvested with 0.25% trypsin and 2 mm EDTA. Cells were kept in suspension at 37 °C for 30–60 min. Alternatively cells were seeded on fibronectin without serum for the indicated time and lysed in Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF) or Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF). Protein concentrations were determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).For separating cytosol and membrane fractions of the cells, the cells were lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA) by using a Dounce homogenizer and subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected as the cytosol fraction. The membrane fraction in the pellets was further separated by centrifugation through a sucrose gradient. The membranes were collected from the 15%/45% sucrose interface and lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected as the membrane fraction.Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating the primary antibodies with the cell lysates for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C. The immunocomplex was captured by adding protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and analyzed by Western blotting or kinase assay.In vitro autophosphorylation assays were performed as described previously (56Kanazawa S. Ilic D. Hashiyama M. Noumura T. Yamamoto T. Suda T. Aizawa S. Blood. 1996; 87: 865-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Src, Fyn, or Yes immunoprecipitates were washed once with kinase reaction buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2) and labeled by addition of 0.5 ml of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) in kinase buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. The labeled protein, separated by SDS-PAGE, was transferred to a nylon membrane. The amount of Src protein on the membrane was visualized with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate (Invitrogen). The membrane was then dried and exposed to x-ray film to detect incorporated radioactivity. The blotting was quantified using an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager.Assays for Luciferase and β-Galactosidase Activity—The cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates coated with fibronectin in DMEM. After 3 h in culture, the cells were subjected to luciferase and β-galactosidase activity analysis by using a luciferase assay kit and β-galactosidase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and analyzed with a luminometer (Turner, model TD-20/20) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The luciferase activities were normalized by β-galactosidase activities to give relative luciferase units.Tumorigenicity and Experimental Metastasis Assays—For each experimental group, we used 12 nude mice (BALB/c, BLK). 4 × 105 viable tumor cells were inoculated using two separate approaches: the transoral approach in which the cells were injected into the floor of the mouth and the tail vein approach (experimental metastasis) in which the cells were injected directly into the circulatory system. Tumor growth was followed for 4–6 weeks. The mice were sacrificed and analyzed for the weight of tumors and the presence of lung metastases.For the transoral tumor invasion assay, oral SCC cells (SCC9, SCC9β6, and SCC9β6KD-Fyn) were injected into the floor of the mouth of the athymic mice using a 30-gauge syringe. The athymic mice were anesthetized peritoneally with Avertin® (0.015 ml of a 2.5% solution/g of body weight). 4 × 105 tumor cells in 50 μl of DMEM were injected transorally into the floor of the mouth. When the tumors became palpable, the mice were monitored three times weekly to assure their ability to take food. After 4–6 weeks, the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the extent of the primary tumor was evaluated. The lesions were weighed and embedded for micrographic studies.For experimental metastasis assays, oral SCC cells, in a volume of 100 μl (4 × 105 cells/mouse), were injected intravenously into the lateral tail vein of nude mice. The mice included in each experiment were sacrificed at a predetermined time and examined for the presence of lung metastases. The lung, liver, and abdominal cavity were inspected. The total number of visible surface tumor colonies was scored with the aid of a dissecting microscope.Statistical Analysis—The differences in the frequency of mice carrying lung metastases were evaluated by Fisher's exact test. The differences in the mean weight of primary tumors were evaluated by Student's t test.RESULTSFyn Is Specifically Activated by Interaction of the Integrin β 6 with Fibronectin (FN)—Src family PTKs have been shown to be downstream effectors in response to integrin activation. To determine whether αvβ6 signaling activates Src family PTKs, we analyzed the activities of Src, Fyn, and Yes, the three main members of Src family PTKs, in β6-transfected SCC9 cells (SCC9β6). Cells were serum-starved for 24 h, detached, and suspended for 30 min. The cells were then activated by being replated onto FN-coated dishes for 2 h to let the cells completely spread onto FN. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Src, anti-Fyn, and anti-Yes. The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to an in vitro kinase assay to determine the activity of Src family PTKs. We found that, upon FN stimulation, 32P incorporation into Fyn was significantly greater in SCC9β6 cells than in mock-transfected SCC9SN cells (Fig. 1A, top panel). In contrast, 32P incorporation into Src (Fig. 1B, top panel) and Yes (Fig. 1C, top panel) was equivalent in SCC9β6 cells and SCC9SN cells. Equivalent levels of all three of these proteins were expressed in SCC9β6 cells and SCC9SN cells (Fig. 1, A–C, bottom panels). These results indicate that β6 signaling activates the Src family PTK Fyn.To confirm that Fyn is activated via interaction of the integrin β6 with FN, we used two approaches. First we seeded SCC cells on collagen I, a β6 non-relevant matrix, where the cells adhere independently of integrin β6 activation and then observed the activation of Fyn by in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 1D, when SCC cells were plated on collagen I, Fyn was not activated. Next we applied the function-blocking antibodies 10D5 and BIIG2 to suppress activation of fibronectin receptors αvβ6 and α5β1, respectively, and then observed the activation of Fyn in SCC cells plated on FN. Our previous study showed that 100 μg/ml 10D5 and 10 μg/ml BIIG2 were the optimal conditions for the functional inhibition of αvβ6 and α5β1, respectively. In this study, we found that the β6 function-blocking antibody 10D5 completely suppressed the activation of Fyn in SCC9β6 cells plated on FN (Fig. 1E, top panel, lane 4). However, BIIG2 did not suppress the activation of Fyn in SCC9β6 cells (Fig. 1E, top panel, lane 6). These results indicate that Fyn is specifically activated by the interaction of the integrin β6 with FN.Fyn Activation by β 6 Is Correlated with SCC Cell Migration—We have previously reported that the initial adhesion to FN is not the primary function of αvβ6 in SCC cells but rather promoting secondary events such as cell migration (30Ramos D.M. But M. Regezi J. Schmidt B.L. Atakilit A. Dang D. Ellis D. Jordan R. Li X. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the current study, we also noticed that the activation of Fyn was detected at 2 h, the relatively later stages of cell adhesion to FN. To detect whether activation of Fyn by the interaction of β6 with FN is correlated with cell migration after adhesion of SCC cells to FN, we plated SCC cells on FN and performed a time course experiment to observe Fyn activation and cell migration. Fyn activity was not observed within the first 60 min of SCC cell adhesion to FN (Fig. 2A). In contrast, after cells had been plated on FN for 60 min, Fyn activity was increased and reached its maximum by 120 min in SCC9β6 cells but not in SCC9SN cells (Fig. 2A). Additionally cell migration was increased after 60 min following FN plating (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that activation of Fyn by the interaction of β6 with FN is correlated with SCC cell migration.Fig. 2Fyn activation by interaction of β6 with FN is correlated with SCC cell migration. A, time course activation of Fyn after plating SCC cells on FN. SCC cells were serum-starved overnight and then replated on FN for the times indicated. Immunoprecipitates (i.p.) were made from ∼500 μg of whole cell lysates with anti-Fyn and subjected to in vitro kinase assays (IVK). The activities of Fyn were determined by 32P incorporation into these proteins. B, SCC cell migration on FN. Cell migration was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 5 × 104 cells were plated on Transwell membranes, both sides of which were coated with FN (10 mg/ml). Cells that migrated onto the bottom side of the membrane for the times indicated were stained and counted by light microscopy at ×40. The data, calculated from three fields of three individual experiments, are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Sus, suspension.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Integrin β 6 Recruits Fyn to Form a β 6-Fyn Complex—To determine whether the integrin β6 directly recruits Fyn to form a β6-Fyn complex, we performed a β6 co-immunoprecipitation analysis with SCC9β6 cells, which express both FAK and Fyn. The β6 immunocomplexes were then probed with anti-Fyn and anti-FAK antibodies. We previously showed that overexpression of the β6 subunit does not alter the expression of other FN-binding integrins (α5β1 and αvβ1) in SCC9β6 cells (30Ramos D.M. But M. Regezi J. Schmidt B.L. Atakilit A. Dang D. Ellis D. Jordan R. Li X. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), so we used the integrin β1 immunoprecipitates as a control. We found that, in response to stimulation with FN, β6 complexed with both Fyn and FAK (Fig. 3A, lane 3). In contrast, β1 formed a complex with FAK but not with Fyn (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2), indicating that activation of the integrin β6 recruits FAK and Fyn to form a β6-Fyn-FAK complex.Fig. 3Fyn is recruited to the integrin β6 to form a β6-Fyn complex. A, formation of a β6-Fyn-FAK complex in SCC9β6 cells. SCC cells were serum-starved overnight and then replated on FN for 2 h. The cells were extracted in Nonidet P-40 buffer. The β6 immunoprecipitates (i.p.) (R6G9) or β1 (AIIB2) were made from 2 mg of whole cell lysates and analyzed by anti-FAK blotting and anti-Fyn blotting (Fyn3). B, the requirement of Fyn for FAK binding to the integrin β6 in the SYF cells. SYF cells, the β6-transfected SYF cells, and the β6-Fyn double-transfected SYF cells were serum-starved overnight and then replated on FN for 2 h. After extraction in Nonidet P-40 buffer, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-β6 antibody (R6G9) and probed by immunoblotting with anti-FAK and anti-Fyn (Fyn3) antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To explore the relationship among the integrin β6, FAK, and Fyn, we used SYF fibroblasts, which lack Src, Fyn, and Yes (14Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). We transfected the SYF fibroblasts with β6 or Fyn and then performed β6 co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Expression of β6 in the SYF cells did not result in FAK-β6 immunocomplexes (Fig. 3B, lane 2). However, when β6 and Fyn were co-expressed in SYF cells, a complex of the integrin β6 with Fyn and FAK was formed (lane 3). These results suggest that recruiting FAK to the integrin β6 complex is dependent on Fyn activation.Catalytic Fyn Increases the Activation of FAK—After we found that Fyn can recruit FAK to the integrin β6-Fyn complex, we asked whether the activity of Fyn is required to activate FAK. To answer this question, we expressed KD-Fyn, a specific competitor for endogenous Fyn, in SCC9β6 cells to inhibit Fyn activity (34Takeuchi M. Kuramochi S. Fusaki N. Nada S. Kawamura-Tsuzuku J. Matsuda S. Semba K. Toyoshima K. Okada M. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27413-27419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We retrovirally transfected SCC9β6 cells with KD-Fyn. The expression levels and the activities of Fyn in these transfected cells were determined by Western blot and densitometry. We found that the expression of Fyn was almost 3 times higher in SCC9β6KD-Fyn cells than in SCC9β6 cells (Fig. 4A, bottom panel, lane 3) (relative value units, 2.8 and 1). However, Fyn activity was significantly less in SCC9β6KD-Fyn cells than in SCC9β6 cells (Fig. 4A, upper panel, lane 3) (relative value units, 1 and 2.2). We next evaluated the effect of KD-Fyn on FAK phosphorylation using the panphosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 or site-specific antibodies to phosphorylated FAK397, FAK576, and FAK925. When the cells were plated on FN, the panphosphorylation of FAK as well as site phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-576 and Tyr-925 were more significantly increased in SCC9β6 cells than in SCC9SN (Fig. 4B, panels 1–4, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, after expression of KD-Fyn in SCC9β6 cells, the panphosphorylation was significantly decreased (Fig. 4B, panel 4, lane 3). Similarly the phosphorylation of FAK576 and FAK925 was decreased, but the phosphorylation"

To understand the molecular basis for the different lipoprotein distributions of these isoforms in human plasma, we examined the lipid-binding properties of the apoE isoforms and some mutants using lipid emulsions. With both large (120 nm) and small (35 nm) emulsion particles, the binding affinity of apoE4 was much higher than that of apoE2 and apoE3, whereas the maximal binding capacities were similar among the three isoforms. The 22-kDa N-terminal fragment of apoE4 displayed a much higher binding capacity than did apoE2 and apoE3. The apoE4(E255A) mutant, which has no electrostatic interaction between Arg61 and Glu255, showed binding behavior similar to that of apoE3, indicating that N- and C-terminal domain interaction in apoE4 is responsible for its high affinity for lipid. In addition, the apoE3(P267A) mutant, which is postulated to contain a long α-helix in the C-terminal domain, had significantly decreased binding capacities for both sizes of emulsion particle, suggesting that the apoE4 preference for VLDL is not due to a stabilized long α-helical structure. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements showed that there is no significant difference in thermodynamic parameters for emulsion binding among the apoE isoforms. However, fluorescence measurements of 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid binding to apoE indicated that apoE4 has more exposed hydrophobic surface compared with apoE3 mainly due to the different tertiary organization of the C-terminal domain. The less organized structure in the C-terminal domain of apoE4 leads to the higher affinity for lipid, contributing to its preferential association with VLDL. In fact, we found that apoE4 binds to VLDL with higher affinity compared with apoE3.

ApoE3, the most common form, contains cysteine and arginine at these positions, respectively, whereas apoE2 contains cysteine and apoE4 contains arginine at both sites (5Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9077-9083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These differences have profound effects on the biological functions of apoE. Both apoE3 and apoE4 bind to the LDL receptor with high affinity, whereas apoE2 exhibits defective binding to the LDL receptor and is associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemia (6Mahley R.W. Huang Y. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1933-1949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoE4 is associated with high plasma cholesterol level and an increased risk for both coronary heart disease and Alzheimer's disease (7Davignon J. Gregg R.E. Sing C.F.

J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1503-1511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoE contains two independently folded functional domains: a 22-kDa N-terminal domain (residues 1–191) and a 10-kDa C-terminal domain (residues 222–299) (11Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Rall Jr., S.C.

The N-terminal domain exists in the lipid-free state as a four-helix bundle of amphipathic α-helices and contains the LDL receptor-binding region (residues 136–150 in helix 4) (13Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar).

In apoE4, these two domains interact in a unique manner unlike in the other isoforms: Arg112 causes a rearrangement of the Arg61 side chain in the N-terminal domain of apoE4, allowing it to interact with Glu255 in the C-terminal domain (15Dong L.M.

This domain interaction in human apoE4 is responsible for the preferential association with VLDL and has been suggested to contribute to the accelerated catabolism of this isoform and, consequently, the increased cholesterol and LDL levels in plasma (9Weisgraber K.H.

A number of recent studies carried out to understand the molecular basis for this phenomenon indicated that the four-helix bundle in the N-terminal domain undergoes a conformational opening upon lipid binding, leading to the receptor-active conformation of apoE (18Raussens V.

In addition, we have recently shown that the two domains in apoE4 lead to two different lipid-bound conformations (open or closed four-helix bundle) on emulsion particles (24Saito H. Dhanasekaran P.

Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Because the three isoforms of apoE exhibit different thermal and chemical stabilities (apoE4 < apoE3 < apoE2) (12Morrow J.A. Segall M.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Knapp M. Rupp B. Weisgraber K.H.

Indeed, the reactivity to dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes of the 22-kDa N-terminal fragments of the three isoforms tends to vary inversely with the stabilities of these fragments (27Segall M.L.

In this study, we examined further the lipid interaction of the three isoforms of apoE using lipoprotein-like emulsion particles to understand the molecular basis for the different lipoprotein distribution of apoE isoforms.

Lipoprotein and Apolipoproteins—VLDL was isolated from fasting normolipidemic human plasma by ultracentrifugation at a density cut of 1.006 g/ml. Examination by agarose gel electrophoresis showed that the VLDL had pre-β mobility and that it was not contaminated with either chylomicrons or LDL. SDS-PAGE showed the expected presence of apoB-100, apoC, and apoE. Gel filtration chromatography (29Boyle K.E. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. Biochim. Biophys.

Full-length human apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4 and their 22- and 10-kDa fragments were expressed and purified as described (24Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Weisgraber K.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C.

The purity of the proteins was monitored by SDS-PAGE (8–25% gradient) with an Amersham Biosciences Phast electrophoresis system. Protein concentrations were determined by the procedure of Lowry et al. (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

The average particle diameter determined by quasi-elastic light scattering measurements was 120 ± 10 nm for large emulsions and 35 ± 5 nm for small emulsions.

In VLDL binding experiments, the incubation mixtures of 14C-labeled apoE and human VLDL (0.3 mg/ml phospholipid) were centrifuged under the same conditions as in the case of small emulsions. Binding data were fitted by nonlinear regression to a one-binding site model with the GraphPAD Prism program. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) Measurements—Heats of apoE binding to emulsions were measured with a MicroCal MCS isothermal titration calorimeter at 25 °C as described (24Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Weisgraber K.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40949-40954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The reactant was placed in the sample cell (1.35 ml) and titrated with 8–10-μl aliquots of the injectant with continual stirring at 400 rpm. To measure the enthalpy of binding at a low surface concentration, apoE solutions were injected into emulsions in the cell at a PC/protein molar ratio of >10,000, at which the injected protein binds completely to the emulsion surface (normal injection). For reverse injection, emulsions were injected into excess apoE (PC/protein ratio < 40), where the emulsion surface appears to be saturated with apoE. Heats of dilution were determined in control experiments by injecting either apoE solution or emulsions into buffer, and these heats were subtracted from the heats determined in the corresponding apoE/emulsion binding experiments. The decay rate constants for the heats of binding were obtained by fitting the titration curves to a one- or two-phase exponential decay model. ANS Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence measurements were obtained with a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer at 25 °C. The apoE sample was freshly dialyzed from 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 1% β-mercaptoethanol solution into Tris buffer (pH 7.4) before use. ANS fluorescence spectra were collected from 400 to 600 nm at an excitation wavelength of 395 nm in the presence of 50 μg/ml protein and 250 μm ANS. Under these conditions, ANS was in at least 100-fold excess to the protein (mol/mol). Binding of ApoE Isoforms to Emulsion Particles—Previously, we determined the parameters for binding of apoE4 and its 22- and 10-kDa fragments to emulsion particles using an ultracentrifugal separation (24Saito H.

In this study, we applied this method to compare the lipid-binding properties of the three isoforms. As shown in Fig. 1, both full-length apoE2 and apoE3 displayed saturable binding to large emulsions, similar to the behavior of full-length apoE4, whereas the 22-kDa fragments of apoE2 and apoE3 hardly bound to the emulsion surface. The dissociation constant (K d) and the maximal binding capacity (B max) for small and large emulsion particles are listed in Table I. In the case of the full-length proteins, apoE2 and apoE3 displayed much lower binding affinity for both emulsions compared with apoE4, whereas the binding capacities of the three isoforms were similar for both emulsion particle sizes. The binding parameters for full-length apoE3 were comparable to the previously reported data for human apoE3 (34Yokoyama S. Kawai Y. Tajima S. Yamamoto A. J. Biol.

In contrast to the 22-kDa fragment of apoE4, the 22-kDa fragments of apoE2 and apoE3 displayed negligible binding capacities for both emulsions.Table IBinding parameters of apoE isoforms and their fragments for emulsion particles35-nm emulsion120-nm emulsionK dBmaxK dBmaxμg/mlamino acids/mol PCμg/mlamino acids/mol PCApoE221.8 ± 4.50.84 ± 0.0718.8 ± 2.90.74 ± 0.05ApoE317.3 ± 2.50.88 ± 0.0519.3 ± 2.30.79 ± 0.04ApoE4aData are from Saito et al.

Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19053-19057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To explore whether this hypothesis can be applied to the different lipid-binding behaviors of apoE3 and apoE4, we examined the lipid-binding properties of two apoE mutants, apoE3(P267A) and apoE4(E255A). ApoE3(P267A) is postulated to have a long α-helix in its C terminus because the mutation P267A is likely to remove the interruption or kink between predicted helices 225–266 and 268–289 (28Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation E255A in apoE4 is known to alter the apoE4 preference from VLDL to HDL by disrupting the domain interaction (16Dong L.M. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19053-19057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the binding isotherms of these mutants for small emulsions in comparison with the isotherms of the respective wild-type proteins; the binding parameters for both sizes of emulsion particles are summarized in Fig. 3. The mutation E255A in apoE4 reduced the lipid affinity without changing the binding capacity for both emulsions; and, as a result, the apoE4(E255A) mutant bound in a similar manner compared with wild-type apoE3 rather than apoE4, indicating that the domain interaction in apoE4 is responsible for its high affinity for lipid. In contrast, the apoE3(P267A) mutant displayed a much lower binding capacity compared with wild-type apoE3 regardless of the emulsion particle size, suggesting that helical length in the C terminus is not responsible for the different lipid-binding behavior of apoE3 and apoE4.Fig. 3Comparison of binding parameters among full-length apoE variants.

These parameters were derived from binding isotherms shown in Figs. 1 and 2. a.a., amino acids.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ITC Measurements—To obtain thermodynamic information about the lipid interaction of apoE isoforms, we performed ITC measurements of apoE binding to emulsions (24Saito H.

Fig. 4 shows the injections of full-length proteins and the 22-kDa fragments of apoE isoforms into large emulsions. Using the binding constants given in Table I and Fig. 3, the thermodynamic parameters for binding of apoE isoforms and mutants to small and large emulsions were obtained (Table II). As previously reported for apoE4 (24Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Weisgraber K.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40949-40954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), binding of apoE isoforms and mutants to large particles was an exothermic process, but binding to small particles was much less exothermic or rather endothermic. As a result, the binding to large particles is enthalpically driven, whereas that to small particles is entropically driven. There was no significant difference in the thermodynamic binding parameters among the full-length apoE isoforms. In contrast, the enthalpies of binding of the 22-kDa fragments of apoE2 and apoE3 to large emulsions were much less exothermic than that of the apoE4 22-kDa fragment. In addition, the slow decay of ITC curves for full-length proteins and the apoE4 22-kDa fragment (half-life = 1.6–2.0 min) that appears to reflect opening of the N-terminal four-helix bundle (24Saito H.

These results suggest that the 22-kDa fragments of apoE2 and apoE3 cannot bind to the emulsion surface with the four-helix bundle in an open conformation (20Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol.

Interestingly, the enthalpies of binding of mutants apoE3(P267A) and apoE4(E255A) to large emulsions were much reduced compared with the wild-type proteins, suggesting that proper arrangements of charged or helical residues in the C-terminal domain are critical to the favorable enthalpy of binding to large particles.Table IIThermodynamic parameters of binding of apoE isoforms and variants to emulsion particles at 25 °C35-nm emulsion120-nm emulsionΔHΔG aFree energy was calculated according to ΔG = —RT ln 55.5(1/Kd) using the binding constants given in Table I and Fig. 3.ΔS bThe entropy of binding was calculated from ΔG = ΔH— TΔS.ΔHΔG aFree energy was calculated according to ΔG = —RT ln 55.5(1/Kd) using the binding constants given in Table I and Fig. 3.ΔS bThe entropy of binding was calculated from ΔG = ΔH— TΔS.kcal/molkcal/molcal/mol Kkcal/molkcal/molcal/mol KApoE25.2 ± 1.9—10.8 ± 0.254 ± 7—64.3 ± 5.5—10.9 ± 0.1—177 ± 19ApoE3—0.9 ± 0.5—11.0 ± 0.134 ± 2—66.6 ± 7.1—10.9 ± 0.1—187 ± 23ApoE4cData are from Saito et al.

In the nucleus, ligand-activated AhR binds to the xenobiotic response elements, initiating chromatin remodeling and recruitment of coregulators, leading to the formation of preinitiation complex followed by elongation.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylated CTD is associated with active elongating RNA PII, while inactive RNA PII is hypophosphorylated. It is recognized that after formation of the preinitiation complex, RNA PII is subjected to negative regulation by the negative transcription elongation factor (N-TEF) (17Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Watanabe D. Takagi T. Hasegawa J. Handa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8085-8092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The N-TEF is composed of the DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) and the negative elongation factor (NELF). NELF is a transcription factor complex that cooperates with DSIF/hSpt4-hSpt5 to repress elongation by RNA PII (19Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). In order for RNA PII to overcome the negative regulation and engage in processive transcription, P-TEFb is required. P-TEFb consists of a regulatory subunit (either cyclin T1, T2, or K) and an enzymatic subunit (CDK9) (18Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). CDK9 phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA PII (20Schroeder S.C. Schwer B. Shuman S. Bentley D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2435-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Hypophosphorylated CTD is associated with RNA PII paused at the initiation stage and is inactive in transcript elongation. P-TEFb phosphorylates CTD to release RNA PII from the arrested state. Thus, CTD-specific kinases and phosphatases can function as transcriptional activators or repressors regulating the activity of RNA Pol II at different stages of transcription.Phosphorylation status of specific serine residues, especially serine 2 and serine 5, are associated with different isoforms of RNA PII engaging at different stages of transcription cycle (20Schroeder S.C. Schwer B. Shuman S. Bentley D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2435-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 21Rodriguez C.R. Cho E.J. Keogh M.C. Moore C.L. Greenleaf A.L. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell.

Serine 2 has been shown to be phosphorylated by P-TEFb (23Zhou M. Halanski M.A. Radonovich M.F. Kashanchi F. Peng J. Price D.H. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell.

NF-κB activation antagonizes TCDD-induced serine 2 phosphorylation. Futhermore, we demonstrated that cyclinT1 directly interacts with AhR in vitro as well as in vivo. Our results suggest that elongation control is an important point of regulation of cyp1a1 expression.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid Constructs and Vectors—pCyclin T1 and pCDK9 were kindly provided by D. Price (University of Iowa). For yeast two hybrid and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays, Cyclin T1 expression plasmids were made by inserting the PCR-generated cyclin T1 fragments into the pGAD424 (Clontech) and pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Biosciences). The PCR primers used are: fragment 1–726: OL1, GCGGATCCCCACCATGGAGGGAGAGAGGAAG and OL726, ACGCGTCGACTTACTTAGGAAGGGGTGGAAG; for fragment 1–250: OL 1 and OL250, ACGCGTCGACTTAGTTGGGAGTTTTCTCCAAAA; for fragment 233–726: OL233, GCGGATCCCCACCATGTTTAGATGAACTGACACATG and OL726. The PCR products were modified with restriction enzymes BamH1 and SalI for insertion into the plasmid vectors. Plasmid pGL3-CYP1A1-Luc was created by inserting the PCR product of the mouse cyp1a1 upstream regulatory region (–1395 to + 1) into the pGL3 basic vector (Promega). PCR primers used were: TTGAGTTAGACACGCCAAGTTCAG and AGTGAAGGAAGAGGGTTAGGGTGAAGGCACCACCAC. In the PCR reaction, mouse genomic DNA was used as the template. The PCR product was cloned into the TA cloning vector (pCR2.1, Invitrogen) and restricted with HindIII and XhoI and then inserted into pGL3 basic vector. Plasmid DNAs used for transfection were purified using the Qiagen Maxi-Prep DNA Isolation system (Qiagen).Antibodies—Antibodies against cyclin T1 (sc-10750), CDK9 (sc-8338) and RNA PII (sc-899) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies Inc. Antibodies against phosphoserine 5 of CTD (H14) and phosphoserine 2 of CTD (H5) were from BabCO (Berkeley, CA). Anti-AhR antibody (SA-210) was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Antibody against ARNT was kindly provided by R. Pollenz (University of South Florida).Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Cells were maintained in αMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B (Invitrogen), 5% CO2 and 37 °C. For transient transfection, Hepa1c1c7 cells were seeded in 12-well plates on day –1 and transfection performed using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) when cell density reached 70% confluence. pSV-β-galactosidase control plasmid (Promega) was used for normalization of transfection efficiency. Six hours after transfection, cells were treated with TCDD or Me2SO (solvent control) for 18 h before harvest for determination of luciferase activity.RNA Isolation and Ribonuclease Protection Assay for Determination of cyp1a1 Transcripts—Hepa1c1c7 cells were seeded into 100-mm in diameter Petri dishes. When growth reached 80% confluence, cells were treated with TCDD (10 nm), DRB (30 μm) + TCDD (10 nm) for 2 h. Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions.The proximal promoter probe was generated by PCR amplification of mouse genomic DNA with PCR primers: TTGAGTTAGACACGCCAAGTTCAG and GAAGTGAAGAGTGTTCTCTAGGAC. PCR products were cloned into a TA cloning vector (pCR2.1, Invitrogen). The DNA template was linearized with Msc1 and used as the template for generation of riboprobe corresponding to the proximal promoter region (–52 to +65). The riboprobe for the cyp1a1 distal region was generated by PCR using plasmid DNA containing cloned distal region of mouse cyp1a1. The PCR primers used were: CAGAAACACAGATCCTGG and TATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAATCAAAGTAACCAGACACATCC, which contains the Sp6 promoter. Antisense probes were prepared using MAXIscript In Vitro Transcription Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ribonuclease protection assays were performed on 20 μg of total RNA and 20,000 cpm of antisense probes using RPA III Ribonuclease Protection Assay Kit (Ambion) according to manufacturer's recommendations.Northern Blot—Total RNA from Hepa1c1c7 cells was isolated using TRIzol reagent. Twenty micrograms of total RNA from each sample were separated on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred overnight onto a nylon membrane. After UV-cross-linking, membrane was prehybridized for 4 h at 42 °C in prehybridization buffer (6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA), and then probed overnight at 42 °C with cyp1a1 cDNA probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Radprime labeling systems (Invitrogen) at 1 × 106 cpm/ml hybridization buffer (6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured fragmented salmon sperm DNA, 50% formamide). After hybridization, the membrane was washed 3 × 5 min in buffer I (2× SSC, 0.5% SDS), 1 × 15 min in buffer II (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS), and then washed with buffer III (0.1% SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 65 °C until the background is low. The wet membrane was exposed at –80 °C overnight using Kodak film. As a control, the blot was stripped and re-probed with α-32P-labeled cDNA for rat GAPDH. Plasmid that contained rat GAPDH cDNA (pBSSKII+) was obtained from Binas (Texas A&M University). Mouse cyp1a1 cDNA was obtained using RT-PCR using total RNA from Hepa1c1c7 cells. The PCR primers were: CCCACAGCACCACAAGAGATA and AAGTAGGAGGCAGGCACAATGTC. The PCR product was inserted to pGEM-T easy vector (Promega). The BamH1- HindIII fragment of GAPDH and PstI fragment of cyp1a1 were used as templates for labeling, respectively.In Vivo Coimmunoprecipitation Assay—The coimmunoprecipitation assays were based on a published procedure with modifications (26Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar, 27Tian Y. Ke S. Denison M.S. Rabson A.B. Gallo M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 510-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Hepa1c1c7 cells were maintained in 100-mm cell culture plates and when growth reached 80% confluence, the cells were treated with TCDD (10 nm) or Me2SO (vehicle control) for 60 min. Before harvest, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and collected by centrifugation at 600 × g. Nuclei of the cells (two plates from each treatment) were isolated based on a published procedure (26Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). The isolated nuclei were lysed in buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 20 mm ZnCl2, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) and centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g, and supernatant fractions were collected. For coimmunoprecipitation assays, the antisera were added to the lysate, and the binding reactions were performed at 4 °C for 2 h on a rotary shaker. 30 μl of GammaBind Plus Sepharose slurry (50% beads) (Amersham Biosciences) were added to precipitate the antibody-antigen complexes. The beads were washed three times in lysis buffer and then boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer. The proteins were separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins on the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad) and the membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 0.05% Tween 20), and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies at 37 °C for 60 min. Blots were washed three times with TBST, then incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of immunoaffinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG linked to alkaline phosphatase. Blots were washed three times with TBST and subsequently developed using NBT/BCIP (Sigma) as the substrate.Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction Assays—Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed according to the Match Maker Gal4 two-hybrid user manual (Clontech). Human AhR cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification of pSport huAhR and the product was cloned into the trp + yeast expression vector pGBT9 (Clontech) in-frame with the DNA binding domain of GAL4, resulting in the pGBT9AhR plasmid. Similarly, cyclin T1 cDNA fragments were cloned into the leu + yeast vector pGAD424 (Clontech) in-frame with the GAL4 transactivation domain, resulting in plasmid pGAD424CycT1 (1–726), pGAD424CycT1 (1–250), and pGAD424CycT1 (233–726). As a positive control the human ARNT cDNA without the activation domain was also cloned into pGAD424 to yield pGAD424 ARNT. The primers used for generation of the cDNA fragment were: GGGCGGATCCCCATGGCGGCGACTACTGCCAAC and GGGCGTCGACGGGAAATCTGGGCCAACATC. Assays for the interactions between AhR and cyclin T1 were performed as follow: Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain SFY526 was grown in YPD medium and transformed by electroporation with pGBT9AhR and pGAD424Cyc T1 plasmids. The transformation mixtures were plated on synthetic drop-out medium minus leucine and tryptophan. For β-galactosidase assays, minimal medium minus leucine and tryptophan was inoculated with single yeast colonies and grown overnight at 30 °C to saturation. To activate the Ah receptor, β-naphthoflavone was added to fresh medium to a final concentration of 5 μm, and the medium was inoculated with an aliquot of the saturated yeast cultures to an OD600 around 0.2. Control cultures were treated with an equivalent amount of dimethyl sulfoxide. All cultures were grown 8–12 h and harvested by centrifugation when OD600 reached 1.0–1.3. The cells were washed in Z buffer and after centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 300 μl of Z buffer and lysed by freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at 37 °C. Z buffer (0.7 ml) and β-mercaptoethanol (0.27 ml) were added to the cells. β-Galactosidase activity was determined by adding 0.16 ml o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml in Z buffer), and reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and the absorbance of supernatants was measured at 420 nm. Each determination was performed in triplicate.GST Pull-down Analysis—[35S]methionine-labeled full-length AhR protein was generated with a TnT-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) using the SP6 promoter-driven cDNA plasmid (phuAhR) as the template. PCR-generated cDNA fragments of cyclin T1 corresponding to amino acids 1–726, 1–250, and 233–726 were inserted in-frame into pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Biosciences), yielding the expression plasmids for GST-cyclin T1 fusion proteins. The plasmids were expressed in E. coli (BL21), and fusion polypeptides were purified with the Bulk GST Purification Module (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Twenty micrograms of each fusion polypeptides (estimated by comparison with bovine serum albumin in an SDS-PAGE gel with Coomassie staining) was incubated with 10 μl of radiolabeled AhR in a total of 100 μl binding reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm DTT, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 100 mm KCl) for 3 h at 4 °C. After incubation, glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were added and washed with the same buffer without bovine serum albumin three times. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in the SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. The signals were detected by autoradiography.Luciferase Reporter Gene Activity Assay—Luciferase assays were performed using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Briefly, the transfected cells were lysed in the culture plates with Reporter Lysis Buffer and the lysates centrifuged at maximum speed for 10 min in an Eppendorf microfuge. 10 μl of the supernatant fraction were incubated with 50 μl of luciferase substrate and relative luciferase activity determined with a luminometer (Turner Designs).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assay was performed based on published protocols (14Ke S. Rabson A.B. Germino J.F. Gallo M.A. Tian Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39638-39644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 34Nissen R.M. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2314-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) with modifications. Hepa1c1c7 cells were maintained in 10-cm plates under standard cell culture conditions. At 80% confluence, formaldehyde was added directed to the media to a final concentration of 1.0% for cross-linking, and the plates were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with gentle rocking. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. The plates were then rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were scraped off the plates and collected into 50-ml conical tubes by centrifugation (600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). Pellets were washed once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm PMSF, resuspended in 2 ml of cell lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES, (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin), and incubated for on ice for 10 min. Cells were homogenized on ice using an A type Dounce homogenizer several times to aid the release of nuclei. The crude nuclei were collected by centrifugation (600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and then resuspended in nuclei lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1% SDS, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin) and incubated again on ice for 10 min. The samples were then sonicated into DNA fragments of 0.5–1.5 kb and microcentrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was precleared by incubation with Staph A cells (2.5 μg/per sample, Roche Applied Science) for 15 min at 4 °C on a rotating platform and after centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min the supernatant was transferred to a clean tube. Appropriate antibodies (1 μg) were added to the supernatant and then 25 μl of precleared 50% protein A/G beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to each tube. Final volume of each sample was adjusted to 400 μl with IP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Trition X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA). The mixtures were incubated on the rotating platform at 4 °C overnight. After incubation, the beads were collected by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 1 min in a microcentrifuge, and pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of 1× Dialysis buffer (2 mm EDTA; 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0; 100 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA) and 5 times with 1 ml of IP Wash buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 9.0, 500 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid) for 10 min with rotation. After the wash, 200 μl of digestion buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml proteinase K) was added to each tube, and tubes were incubated at 55 °C for 3 h and followed by 6 h at 65 °C to reverse the cross-linking. The samples were extracted once with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol and once with chloroform and then ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 20 μg of glycogen overnight. The precipitated pellets were collected by centrifugation at top speed and the pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of TE buffer. Aliquots from each tube were used for PCR amplification. The PCR products were either separated on 1.2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining or separated by 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In later cases, one of the PCR primers was end-labeled by 32P, and signals of the PCR products were visualized by autoradiography. The primer pairs for PCR of the cyp1a1 promoter region were: –1100 to –770, TTAAGAGCCTCACCCACGG and GCGGGTGCAGAGCTATCTAAG; –285 to +66, TTTCCTCAAACCCCTCCCTC and GAAGTGAAGAGTGTTCTCTAGGAC.RESULTSLigand-activated AhR Recruits Cyclin T1, CDK9, and RNA Pol II to the cyp1a1 Promoter with Concomitant Phosphorylation of RNA PII CTD—To investigate the elongation control of cyp1a1 transcription, we used in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to analyze the recruitment of the cyclin T1, CDK9, and RNA PII to the cyp1a1 promoter and the residue-specific phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA PII in response to AhR activation. In Hepa1c1c7 cells, 30 min after TCDD treatment, AhR and ARNT began to associate with the cyp1a1 regulatory region followed by the recruitment of RNA PII at the promoter region (30–60 min after TCDD treatment) (Fig. 1). P-TEFb complex was recruited to the promoter region at 60 min and coincided with strong phosphorylation of serine 2 of the CTD. Interestingly, although the strongest phosphorylation of serine 2 of RNA PII CTD was detectable at 60 min, strongest phosphorylation of serine 5 was detected after serine 2 phosphorylation. In addition, the increases of serine 5 phosphorylation correlated with decreases of serine 2 phosphorylation, suggesting that phosphorylations of serine 2 and serine 5 are controlled by separate mechanisms (Fig. 1).Inhibition of Kinase Activity of P-TEFb Selectively Blocks cyp1a1 Transcript Elongation by RNA Pol II but Not the Assembly of the Preinitiation Complex—Phosphorylation of the CTD of RNA PII is associated with transition from the initiation to elongation stage of transcription (16Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of P-TEFb in cyp1a1 elongation control, we used the specific P-TEFb inhibitor DRB, to test the involvement of P-TEFb in cyp1a1 elongation. DRB treatment (30 μm, 2 h) inhibited phosphorylation of serine 2 and reduced serine 5 phosphorylation of CTD and prevented the RNA Pol II from transcribing the cyp1a1 distal region as determined by ChIP assay (compare lanes 5 and 6 in Fig. 2A).

In the MUTYH-null cells carrying no adenine DNA glycosylase activity, the spontaneous mutation rate increased 2-fold in comparison with wild type cells. The expression of wild type mMUTYH or mutant mMUTYH protein with amino acid substitutions at the proliferating cell nuclear antigen binding motif restored the increased spontaneous mutation rates of the MUTYH-null ES cells to the wild type level.

Cellular DNA is at high risk of being oxidized by reactive oxygen species, which are inevitably generated by normal metabolic functions such as mitochondrial respiration or by environmental exposure to ionizing radiation and chemicals. The oxidation of DNA appears to result in either spontaneous mutagenesis or cell death, thus being implicated in various age-related diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration (1Ames B. Shigenaga M. Hagen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7915-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (5415) Google Scholar). Among the various types of oxidized damage in DNA, 8-oxo-G, 1The abbreviations used are: 8-oxo-G, 8-oxoguanine; mMUTYH, mouse MUTYH; hMUTYH, human MUTYH; BER, base excision repair; ES, embryonic stem; neo, neomycin resistance gene; HSV, herpes simplex virus; tk, thymidine kinase; RT, reverse transcriptase; Trx, thioredoxin; 6-TG, 6-thioguanine; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HAT, hypoxanthine, aminopterine, and thymidine; FAM, N-(3-fluoranthyl)maleimide. an oxidized form of guanine, can pair with adenine as well as cytosine during DNA replication and is thus considered to be one of the spontaneous causes of G:C to T:A transversion mutation (2Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar). Mutator mutants in Escherichia coli revealed that the mutM (fpg) gene encoding 8-oxo-G DNA glycosylase, which excises 8-oxo-G opposite cytosine in DNA, and the mutY gene encoding the adenine DNA glycosylase, which removes adenine incorporated opposite 8-oxo-G in template DNA, play important roles in the prevention of such spontaneous mutagenesis (3Tajiri T. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Mutat. Res. 1995; 336: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). It has been established that most eukaryotic cells also possess either a MutM homolog or its functional homolog, OGG1 for the repair of 8-oxo-G, and a MutY homolog (MUTYH or MYH) for the repair of adenine opposite 8-oxo-G (4Nakabeppu Y. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 75-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli and fission yeast, the absence of these repair enzymes resulted in significant increases in the spontaneous mutation rate, especially of G:C to T:A transversion mutation (3Tajiri T.

Recently, familial alterations in the human MUTYH gene have been reported to be possible causative mutations for certain types of familial colorectal tumors without a germ-line mutation in the APC gene, thus suggesting that the absence of the MUTYH function in human cells might also result in a mutator phenotype (6Al-Tassan N.

Generation of the MUTYH-null ES Cell Lines—Genomic fragments spanning the sequence encoding exons 3–17 of murine Mutyh was isolated from a 129/Sv mouse genomic library, using a mouse Mutyh cDNA probe (8Hayashi H. Tominaga Y. Hirano S. McKenna A.E. Nakabeppu Y. Matsumoto Y. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 335-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Genomic fragments of 4.3 and 3 kb flanked by exons 8–15 of Mutyh gene were used to generate a targeting construct in which exons 8–15 were replaced by a RNA polymerase II-neo-poly(A) cassette (9Ide Y. Tsuchimoto D. Tominaga Y. Iwamoto Y. Nakabeppu Y. Genomics. 2003; 81: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To increase the frequency of gene targeting, a pair of HSV-1 and HSV-2 tk cassettes (tk1 and tk2) was placed flanking the Mutyh genomic sequence in the targeting vector (9Ide Y. Tsuchimoto D. Tominaga Y. Iwamoto Y. Nakabeppu Y. Genomics. 2003; 81: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). CCE28 ES cells were electroporated with the SalI-linearized targeting vector, and then Mutyh +/– clones were selected in the presence of 0.25 mg/ml G418 (Sigma) and 5 μm ganciclovir (Japan Syntechs). Among the 89 ES cell colonies, 23 correctly targeted clones were identified by a Southern blot analysis. Subsequently, two Mutyh –/– clones (YDK15, YDK32) were independently obtained by the selection of two Mutyh +/– cells (YSK25, YSK38) in higher concentrations of G418 (2.0 mg/ml). For mutagenesis assay, we used YDK15 and YDK32 cells at the passage number 7 to 8 after single colony isolation of each line, and wild type CCE28 cells were similarly passaged before the experiment. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from the cultured cells using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences) as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, PCR was performed with primers mY5-2 (5′-CCTGGTGCAAAGGCCTGA-3′) corresponding to nucleotides 1071–1088 of Mutyh mRNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_133250) and mY3-4A (5′-ATTCCTCCCAGGTCAGCCAT-3′) corresponding to nucleotides 1345–1326 of the Mutyh mRNA to confirm the deletion of Mutyh. A RT-PCR analysis of GAPDH mRNA was also performed as a control with primers mGA5–1 (5′-CTGCCATTTGCAGTGGCAAAG-3′) corresponding to nucleotides 126–146 of GAPDH mRNA (GenBank™ accession number XM_194302) and mGA3–1 (5′-TGGTATTCAAGAGAGTAGGGA-3′) corresponding to nucleotides 1230–1210 of the GAPDH mRNA. These oligonucleotides were obtained from the Hokkaido System Science Co. Ltd. Western Analysis—Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and then were transferred onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore Inc.), and Western blotting analyses were performed as described previously by Tsuchimoto et al. (10Tsuchimoto D. Sakai Y. Sakumi K. Nishioka K. Sasaki M. Fujiwara T. Nakabeppu Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), using anti-hMUTYH (11Ohtsubo T.

Nicking Assay—Double-stranded oligonucleotide substrates for a nicking assay were prepared and then the standard nicking assay was performed, as described previously (11Ohtsubo T. Nishioka K. Imaiso Y. Iwai S. Shimokawa H. Oda H. Fujiwara T. Nakabeppu Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1355-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Mutation Analysis—A fluctuation assay was performed as follows. Initially, 100 cells of each cell line were plated onto a well of a 24-well plate with feeder cells, and each culture was expanded onto one 60-mm dish, and finally onto one 100-mm dish (∼5.0 × 106 cells per dish) with ES medium containing 6-TG (1 μg/ml) (Sigma). The number of 6-TG-resistant colonies was counted after 14 days of selection with 6-TG. The mutation rate was calculated using the equation of Luria and Delbrück (12Luria S.E. Delbruck M. Genetics. 1943; 28: 491-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the table of Capizzi and Jameson (13Capizzi R.L. Jameson J.W. Mutat. Res. 1973; 17: 147-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A mutation analysis utilizing HAT-cleansed cells was also performed according to Rossman et al. (14Rossman T.G. Goncharova E.I. Nadas A. Mutat. Res. 1995; 328: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Rossman T.G. Goncharova E.I. Nadas A. Dolzhanskaya N. Mutat. Res. 1997; 373: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). HAT-cleansed cells were subcultured at 1 × 106 cells/10 cm dish (six dishes) for 2 days in ES medium, and then the cells were subjected to 6-TG selection to obtain the mutant frequency (F). The number of the generations (g) was calculated by the following equation: g = (ln[total number of cells] – ln[number of cells plated × plating efficiency])/ln2. The mutation rate p is estimated according to the formula: p = 2F/g. Expression of mMUTYH Protein—For expression of mMUTYH in E. coli, mouse Mutyh cDNA was subcloned into pET32a(+) (Novagen). A fusion protein with thioredoxin (Trx-mMUTYH) was expressed and purified using cobalt beads (TALON™ Superflow™ metal affinity resin, Clontech) followed by gel filtration on Superose 12/30 (Amersham Biosciences), as described previously (9Ide Y. Tsuchimoto D. Tominaga Y. Iwamoto Y. Nakabeppu Y. Genomics. 2003; 81: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 10Tsuchimoto D. Sakai Y. Sakumi K. Nishioka K. Sasaki M. Fujiwara T. Nakabeppu Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For the expression of MUTYH protein in mouse cells, mouse Mutyh cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Hygro(+) (Invitrogen), and plasmid was electroporated into YDK15 cells, and stable transfectants grown in the presence of hygromycin B (140 and 160 μg/ml, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) were established. YDK15 cells expressing wild type mMUTYH were designated as YDKWT cells. YDK15 cells expressing a mutant mMUTYH(AA) with amino acid substitutions (500/501FF to 500/501AA) in the PCNA binding motif of mMUTYH, or mutant mMUTYH(G356D) with an amino acid substitution of Gly365 to Asp365 were designated as YDKAA and YDKG365D cells, respectively. YDK15 cells, which received only pcDNA3.1/Hygro(+), were designated as YDKV cells. All cell lines, YDKWT, YDKAA, YDKG365D, and YDKV, were used for the mutagenesis assay at the passage number 7 to 8 after single colony isolation of each line. PCNA Pull-down Assay—Trx-mMUTYH fusion proteins or Trx protein immobilized on S-protein-agarose (Novagen) were used for PCNA pull-down assay as described previously by Tsuchimoto et al. (10Tsuchimoto D. Sakai Y. Sakumi K. Nishioka K. Sasaki M. Fujiwara T. Nakabeppu Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To understand the physiological role of MUTYH in vivo, we disrupted the Mutyh gene in mouse ES cells (Fig. 1A). Mutyh +/– ES cell lines were obtained by homologous recombination, and subsequently two independent Mutyh –/– ES cell lines (YDK15, YDK32) were established (Fig. 1, B and C). As shown in Fig. 1D, several bands were detected in the whole cell extract prepared from parental CCE28 cells by Western blotting with anti-hMUTYH, and a major 50-kDa and minor 47-kDa band disappeared in the Mutyh –/– ES cells (YDK15, YDK32). A MUTYH activity introducing alkaline-labile site opposite 8-oxo-G, namely DNA glycosylase activity excising adenine opposite 8-oxo-G, was detected in the extract from CCE 28, but such activity was not detected in the extracts from YDK15 and YDK32 cells. All extracts examined contained comparable levels of nicking activity toward 8-oxo-G opposite cytosine in oligonucleotide (Fig. 2B), thus confirming that YDK15 and YDK32 cells are MUTYH-null mutants. The MUTYH-null cells grew normally in ES medium, and their average doubling times (9.2 h) at 37 °C were essentially the same as that of CCE28 cells. We did not observe any hypersensitivity to H2O2 or menadione challenge in the MUTYH-null ES cells. Chimeric mice were generated from the Mutyh +/– ES cells to establish MUTYH-null mice. The MUTYH-null mice were viable and fertile, and those are now under long term observation for carcinogenesis (data not shown). The mutation rates toward 6-TG resistance were determined by a fluctuation test using three cell lines, CCE28, YDK15 and YDK32. A 2-fold higher mutation rate was observed in the two independently isolated MUTYH-null cells, compared with the value of parental CCE28 cells (Table I). Essentially the same levels of spontaneous mutation rates were obtained by a mutation analysis utilizing HAT-cleansed cultures: CCE28, 2.99 × 10–8; YDK15, 6.20 × 10–8 mutations/locus/generation, respectively.Table IIncreased spontaneous mutation rate in MUTYH-null ES cellsCCE28CCE28YDK15YDK15YDK32YDK32Number of samples (C)212121212121Final cell number (Nt) (×106)4.836.137.997.205.184.14Average number of mutant cells (r)0.240.140.951.190.710.43Cr5.042.9419.9524.9914.919.03CaNt aDerived by linear interpolation from the table of CaNt as a function of Cr (13).3.772.839.0510.597.435.47Variance0.290.133.6513.55.313.86Mutation rate (a)bMutation rate, a = CaNt/CNt.

Open table in a new tab We introduced an expression vector carrying Mutyh cDNA into the YDK15 cells and established a stable cell line (YDKWT). The levels of adenine DNA glycosylase activity as well as the 50-kDa mMUTYH protein in the cells were comparable with the levels seen in CCE28 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). The spontaneous mutation rate of YDKWT cells determined by using HAT-cleansed cells was as low as that of CCE28 cells, but YDKV cells, in which only the vector plasmid was introduced, exhibited a 2-fold higher mutation rate than YDKWT cells (Fig. 3). We introduced amino acid substitutions (500/501FF to 500/501AA) in the PCNA binding motif of mMUTYH, and an expression vector encoding the mutant mMUTYH(AA) protein was introduced into YDK15 cells. An established cell line (YDKAA) expressed mutant mMUTYH(AA) protein with a substantial level of adenine DNA glycosylase activity (Fig. 2, A and B). YDKAA cells exhibited a slightly lower level of spontaneous mutation rate in comparison with YDKWT cells (Fig. 3). Recombinant Trx-mMUTYH efficiently bound to PCNA in vitro, while no binding of Trx-mMUTYH(AA) to PCNA was observed (data not shown). Finally, we examined the effect of a G365D mutation in mMUTYH, which corresponds to a germ-line mutation (G382D) of the human MUTYH gene found in patients with multiple colorectal adenomas (6Al-Tassan N. Chmiel N.H. Maynard J. Fleming N. Livingston A.L. Williams G.T. Hodges A.K. Davies D.R. David S.S. Sampson J.R. Cheadle J.P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 7Sieber O.M. Lipton L. Crabtree M. Heinimann K. Fidalgo P. Phillips R.K. Bisgaard M.L. Orntoft T.F. Aaltonen L.A. Hodgson S.V. Thomas H.J. Tomlinson I.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Recombinant Trx-mMUTYH(G365D) had a closely similar level of adenine DNA glycosylase activity to that of wild type Trx-mMUTYH (Fig. 2, C and D). The mutant mMUTYH(G365D) was stably expressed in the MUTYH-null ES cells; however, no adenine DNA glycosylase activity was detected in the cell-free extract prepared from the established cell line (YDKG365D) (Fig. 2, A and B), and the cells exhibited an increased spontaneous mutation rate which was as high as that of MUTYH-null cells (YDKV) (Fig. 3), thus indicating that the G365D mutation indeed causes a loss of the mMUTYH function in vivo. The spontaneous mutation rate in the Hprt locus increased 2-fold in MUTYH-null ES cells in comparison with wild type CCE28 ES cells. We previously reported that MTH1-null ES cells also exhibited a 2-fold increase in the spontaneous mutation rate (16Tsuzuki T. Egashira A. Igarashi H. Iwakuma T. Nakatsuru Y. Tominaga Y. Kawate H. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Ide F. Kura S. Nakabeppu Y. Katsuki M. Ishikawa T. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11456-11461Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Mice lacking MTH1 spontaneously develop cancer more frequently in the liver, lung, or stomach than do wild type, thus suggesting that these proteins play a tissue-specific role in the suppression of tumorogensis (16Tsuzuki T. Egashira A. Igarashi H. Iwakuma T. Nakatsuru Y. Tominaga Y. Kawate H. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Ide F. Kura S. Nakabeppu Y. Katsuki M. Ishikawa T. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11456-11461Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Mice lacking MUTYH protein are now under long term observation for spontaneous carcinogenesis, and the moderate mutator phenotype of MUTYH-null ES cells suggests that such mice are also mildly predisposed to certain types of tumors. The increased spontaneous mutation rate in the MUTYH-null ES cells was completely suppressed by the expression of a mouse Mutyh cDNA encoding a 50-kDa mMUTYH protein with the restoration of adenine DNA glycosylase activity, thus confirming that the 50-kDa mMUTYH protein is a functional form of mouse MUTYH. Based on this finding, we examined exogenously expressed mutant mMUTYH proteins to determine whether or not they can suppress the increased spontaneous mutagenesis in MUTYH-null ES cells. We and others (8Hayashi H. Tominaga Y. Hirano S. McKenna A.E. Nakabeppu Y. Matsumoto Y. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 335-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Parker A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11853-11858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) showed that MUTYH may interact with PCNA to exert post-replicative BER for adenine opposite 8-oxo-G. After introduction of a plasmid containing the A:8-oxo-G pair into differentiated MUTYH-null ES cells with a plasmid encoding wild type but not the mutant mMUTYH(AA) protein, which had amino acid substitutions at the PCNA binding motif, the A:8-oxo-G pair was efficiently repaired to C:G pair (8Hayashi H. Tominaga Y. Hirano S. McKenna A.E. Nakabeppu Y. Matsumoto Y. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 335-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), thus indicating that mMUTYH requires an interaction with PCNA to exert the post-replicative BER. In the present study, the mutant mMUTYH(AA) significantly suppressed the increased spontaneous mutation rate in the MUTYH-null ES cells, and we concluded that MUTYH may not require PCNA to exert its repair function. In the previous study (8Hayashi H. Tominaga Y. Hirano S. McKenna A.E. Nakabeppu Y. Matsumoto Y. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 335-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), only the post-replicative BER for A:8-oxo-G pair was assayed using a replication-competent plasmid. In contrast, the spontaneous mutagenesis analyzed in the present study reflects all existing mechanisms involved in the process, including both the pre-replicative and post-replicative BER, as well as the mismatch repair. This may be a reason that the contribution of PCNA-dependent BER is very low in the endogenous target gene, Hprt, or it is still possible that the transient transfection experiment of the reporter plasmid may not fully reproduce the chromosomal context of endogenous genes, thus exhibiting only a part of facts. If mMUTYH(AA) protein without its PCNA interaction can excise adenine in the template DNA to which 8-oxo-G was inserted from nucleotide pool, A:T to C:G transversion mutation might be highly induced. Our results suggest that mMUTYH(AA) or wild type mMUTYH can also interact with other components of post-replicative BER, as reported previously (19Gu Y. Parker A. Wilson T.M. Bai H. Chang D.Y. Lu A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11135-11142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), thus ensuring the strand recognition. Alternatively, 8-oxo-dGTP produced in the nucleotide pool is efficiently sanitized by MTH1, thus preventing the incorporation of 8-oxo-G opposite adenine in the template DNA. As a result, mMUTYH(AA) could efficiently suppress spontaneous mutagenesis by simply excising adenine opposite 8-oxo-G. If this is the case, then MUTYH-null cells expressing mMUTYH(AA) might increase their spontaneous mutation rate in the absence of the MTH1 function. A germ-line mutation (G382D) of the human MUTYH gene found in patients with multiple colorectal adenomas (6Al-Tassan N. Chmiel N.H. Maynard J. Fleming N. Livingston A.L. Williams G.T. Hodges A.K.

Med. 2003; 348: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar) is expected to have some sort of functional abnormality. E. coli MutY mutant with a corresponding amino acid substitution (G253D) was reported to possess a substantial level of adenine DNA glycosylase (6Al-Tassan N. Chmiel N.H. Maynard J. Fleming N. Livingston A.L. Williams G.T. Hodges A.K. Davies D.R. David S.S. Sampson J.R. Cheadle J.P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). We confirmed that it is also true for mMUTYH mutant with G365D substitution. In contrast, MUTYH-null cells expressing the mMUTYH(G365D) mutant exhibited no adenine DNA glycosylase activity in the cell-free extract, and their spontaneous mutation rate was as high as that of MUTYH-null cells, thus indicating that the mMUTYH(G365D) expressed in mouse ES cells could not demonstrate repair capacity either in vivo or in the cell-free extract. Currently, it is not clear why the mutant protein expressed in mouse ES cells was not active as adenine DNA glycosylase. The mMUTYH(G365D) protein exhibited a slightly decreased mobility on SDS-PAGE in comparison with wild type or mMUTYH(AA) mutant proteins (Fig. 2A), indicating that there may be a difference in post-translational modifications of these proteins. Since a serine residue in the amino acid sequence containing the G365 residue, RPDSGLL was predicted as a possible phosphorylation site by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II or protein kinase A using a software program PhosphoBase V 2.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/databases/PhosphoBase/) (20Kreegipuu A. Blom N. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), it may be likely that the G365D substitution alters such a modification in vivo, thus resulting in both the decreased mobility on SDS-PAGE and the loss of its catalytic activity. This is the first observation of a functional abnormality in the mMUTYH protein with an amino acid substitution corresponding to the germ-line mutation (G382D) of the human MUTYH gene in patients with multiple colorectal adenomas. Our findings and MUTYH-null cells are thus considered to provide a clue to elucidate the molecular basis of mutagenesis and carcinogenesis which can be suppressed by MUTYH.

https://openalex.org/W2035474317,"Snail family genes are conserved among species during evolution and encode transcription factors expressed at different stages of development in different tissues. These genes are involved in a broad spectrum of biological functions: cell differentiation, cell motility, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. However, little is known about the target genes involved in these functions. Here we show that mouse Snail family members, Snail (Sna) and Slug (Slugh), are involved in chondrocyte differentiation by controlling the expression of type II collagen (Col2a1) and aggrecan. In situ hybridization analysis of developing mouse limb demonstrated that Snail and Slug mRNAs were highly expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes. Inversely, the expression of collagen type II mRNA disappeared during hypertrophic differentiation. Snail and Slug mRNA expression was down-regulated during differentiation of the mouse chondrogenic cell line ATDC5 and overexpression of exogenous Snail or Slug in ATDC5 cells inhibited expression of collagen type II and aggrecan mRNA. Reporter analysis revealed Snail and Slug suppressed the promoter activity of Col2a1, and the E-boxes in the promoter region were the responsible element. Gel shift assay demonstrated the binding of Snail to the E-box.

During skeletal development, condensed mesenchymal cells give rise to chondrocytes and form cartilage primordia, which serve as templates for endochondral bone formation. In cartilage primordia, chondrocytes undergo further differentiation, starting as proliferating chondrocytes, becoming prehypertrophic chondrocytes and ending as hypertrophic chondrocytes. Chondrocytes secrete abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; PTH, parathyroid hormone; PTHrP, parathyroid hormone-related protein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; HA, hemagglutinin. into the extracellular space, and the composition of ECM changes during the sequential differentiation steps. Type II collagen and aggrecan are major components of the cartilage extracellular matrix produced by proliferating and prehypertrophic chondrocytes, and type X collagen is a major collagen type produced by hypertrophic chondrocytes. The differentiation into hypertrophic chondrocytes is accompanied with changes in ECM; switching of collagen types from type II to type X and the disappearance of aggrecan and link protein (1Chen Q.

Dennefeld C. Alberga A. Nature. 1987; 330: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Snail family members have been evolutionarily conserved among many species. They share highly conserved C2H2 type zinc finger domains, which bind to the E-box and repress the transcription of target genes (reviewed in Ref. 15Hemavathy K. Ashraf S.I. Ip Y.T. Gene. 2000; 257: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Snail-related transcription repressors were shown to play roles in a broad spectrum of biological functions such as cell differentiation, cell adhesion, cell movement, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis (16Ashraf S.I.

Expression patterns of mouse Snail and Slug in the early developmental stage suggest involvement of Snail and Slug in chondrogenesis (24Nieto M.A. Bennett M.F. Sargent M.G. Wilkinson D.G.

Mouse Snail mRNA is expressed in condensed precartilage mesenchyme but not detected in chondrocytes at 14.5 days except in the distal phalanges of the hind limbs, which are the only sites of precartilage in the limbs at this stage (24Nieto M.A. Bennett M.F. Sargent M.G. Wilkinson D.G. Development. 1992; 116: 227-237PubMed Google Scholar). In the 3-day-old rat, mRNA of rat Slug is detected in condensing mesenchymal cells corresponding to cartilage precursors, and at 5 days, the cartilage primordium itself was negative for the expression (29Savagner P. Karavanova I. Perantoni A. Thiery J.P. Yamada K.M. Dev Dyn. 1998; 213: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this study we found an inverse correlation between the gene expression of Snail and Slug and type II collagen and aggrecan in vivo and in vitro during chondrocyte differentiation in the growth plate of mouse embryos. For the experiments in vitro, we have used well characterized chondrogenic cell line, ATDC5, which is derived from embryonal teratocarcinoma and recapitulate the sequential steps of chondrocyte differentiation (29Savagner P. Karavanova I. Perantoni A. Thiery J.P. Yamada K.M. Dev Dyn. 1998; 213: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Smith D.E. del Amo F.F. Gridley T.

Grant M.E. Wallis G.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Using ATDC5 cells we found that overexpression of Snail or Slug reduced the expression level of type II collagen mRNA and aggrecan mRNA. Reporter analysis using the Col2a1 promoter revealed that Snail and Slug suppress the activity. We found that E-boxes, which are binding motifs for the Snail family, are involved in the negative regulation of Col2a1 transcription (13Murray D. Precht P. Balakir R. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 5: 3610-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Reporter analysis showed Snail suppressed the transcriptional activity of Col2a1 through the E-boxes. Gel shift assay demonstrated the binding of Snail to the E-box. These results suggest that Snail and Slug regulate chondrocyte differentiation by repressing the genes, the Col2a1 gene and possibly the aggrecan gene, that encode major ECM molecules in cartilage. Cell Culture—ATDC5 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics in plastic dishes at 37 °C under 5% CO2. For the induction of chondrocyte differentiation in three-dimension culture, the cells were trypsinized and embedded in alginate beads in a differentiation medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12, 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml human insulin, 10 μg/ml human transferrin, 10 ng/ml sodium selenite (Roche Applied Science), and antibiotics. To embed the cells into beads, trypsinized cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 1,500 rpm, washed once with a 150 mm NaCl solution, and suspended in a alginate solution (1.2% alginate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm HEPES) at a cell density of 1.0 × 106 cells/ml. This mixture was poured into a plastic syringe and dropped through a 22-gauge needle into 40 ml of a 50 mm CaCl2 solution. The CaCl2 solution was decanted and the beads were washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium. Beads were placed at 37 °C in 100 mm dishes with 20 ml of the differentiation medium. For the cell recovery, the culture medium was discarded and the beads were washed once with PBS and dissociated in 150 mm NaCl. The cells were pelleted from the suspension. Transfection Assay—ATDC5 cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). First, 250,000 cells were seeded per 100 mm dish. Then after 16 h of culture, they were transfected with 12 μg of plasmid mixture. The medium was renewed 24 h after the transfection. For Northern blotting, the cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Stable transfectants of ATDC5 expressing exogenous Snail or Slug were established following transfection with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). At 16 h after the seeding of 80,000 cells per well onto 24-well plates, cells were transfected with 0.9 μg of plasmid. Stable transfectants were selected in 400 μg/ml of G418 for 10 days. pcDNA3 mSna was kindly provided by A. Cano (18Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barro M.G. Portillo F.M. Nieto A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar) and pcDTet-mtmSna by J. Cross. PCR3 Mslug S was previously described (26Savagner P. Yamada K.M. Thiery J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1403-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). For tetracycline-induced exogenous Snail expression, ATDC5 cells transfected with pcDTet-mtmSna were cultured in beads for 48 h with 3 ng/ml of doxycyclin in the differentiation medium. At this concentration, doxycyclin was not toxic to cells undergoing chondrogenic differentiation in the three-dimension culture or in monolayer culture. In Situ Hybridization—Templates for 35S-labeled riboprobes for type II collagen, type X collagen, Snail, and Slug mRNAs were used as described previously (18Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I.

Antisense [35S]cRNAs were synthesized using the Gemini Transcription kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and [35S]UTP (1289 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (33Lee K. Lanseke B. Karaplis A.C. Deeds J.D. Kohno H. Nissenson R.A. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5109-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Slides were dipped into NTB-2 (Eastman Kodak Co.) and stored at 4 °C for 3 to 4 days to visualize signals. After development, sections were counter-stained with hematoxylin and eosin and mounted. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from ATDC5 cells using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). The 8 μg RNA was applied to an agarose gel for electrophoresis, then transferred onto a Hybond N membrane (Amersham Biosciences). cDNAs were labeled with [32P]dCTP using a Random Primed DNA Labeling kit (Promega) and used for probes. The membranes were hybridized with the labeled probe at 68 °C, washed first at room temperature in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS and then at 65 °C in 0.2X SSC and 0.1% SDS, and analyzed with a Cyclone Phosphorimager (Packard). Probes for type II collagen, type X collagen, and the PTH/PTHrP receptor were prepared from plasmids described previously (33Lee K. Lanseke B. Karaplis A.C. Deeds J.D. Kohno H. Nissenson R.A. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5109-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Probes for Snail and Slug were prepared from fragments of the plasmids used for in situ hybridization. Sox9 probes were made from mouse cDNA (1070–1324). Reporter Assays—The plasmid constructs pCII-312, pCII 977, pCII-312E, and pCII-977E have been described previously (34Savagner P. Miyashita T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6669-6674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, these constructs contain the 5′-flanking sequence from the rat Col2a1 gene upstream of the CAT coding sequence. pCII-312E and pCII-977 also contain a 1,500-bp region from the first intron that has enhancer activity. For CAT assays, ATDC5 cells were transfected in 100 mm dishes using LipofectAMINE 2000 or FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were co-transfected with Snail or Slug expression plasmid, 2.5 μg of reporter plasmid (pCII-312, pCII-977, pCII-312E, or pCII-977E), 2.5 μg of β-galactosidase expression plasmid (CMV β-gal) and pcDNA3.1. For LipofectAMINE 2000, the total amount of DNA was kept at 20 μg with pcDNA3.1, and cells were exposed to the DNA solution for 2 h and then cultured in fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. For FuGENE 6, the total amount of DNA was kept 12 μg with pcDNA3.1, and the DNA solution was added to the culture medium and left for 24 h. The medium was then renewed. For three-dimension culture, the cells were embedded in alginate beads 24 h after transfection and cultured in the differentiation medium for 48 h. For monolayer cultures, the cells were cultured in the maintaining medium for 48 h after transfection. Nuclear extracts were prepared for the analysis of CAT activity (35Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of cellular proteins were incubated in the reaction buffer (2.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm acetyl-CoA (Roche Applied Science), and 2μCi/ml [14C]chloramphenicol (PerkinElmer Life Science)) for2hat37 °C. The level of acetylation was examined by TLC followed by quantitation using a Cyclone phosphorimaging device (Packard). CAT activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity with a Galacto-Light Plus system (Tropix). For luciferase assays, ATDC5 cells were transfected in six-well plates using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The EBx1 Luc construct was generated by inserting a PCR-amplified 283-bp promoter region into pE1b-luc (previously described by A. Hata) and was verified by sequencing. mutEBx1 Luc was generated by PCR using a mismatch primer. 977-luc reporter was generated by inserting a PCR-amplified 977-bp sequence from pCII-977 into pE1b-luc, and the E-box mutant series was made by introducing mutations in each E-box using a mismatch primer to CATGCG. All plasmids were verified by sequencing. Luciferase assays were carried out with a Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and Berthold luminometer. A β-galactosidase expression vector was co-transfected for normalization and assayed with a Galacto-Light Plus kit (Tropix). pCR3 Mslug S and antisense Slug plasmid were previously described (26Savagner P. Yamada K.M. Thiery J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1403-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) Electromobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The expression plasmid for HA-tagged Snail (17Batlle E. Sancho E. Franci C. Dominguez D. Monfar M. Baulida J. Garcia de Hereros A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar) was transfected into ATDC5 cells and nuclear extracts were prepared 48 h after the transfection. We used double-stranded oligonucleotide probes, which contained Snail-related transcription factor binding sites (E-box 4) plus unique flanking sequences. In addition, we used oligonucleotide competitors with either an intact or mutated E-box 4 site in competition EMSA experiments. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in all binding reactions are as follows: wild type probe (sense strand), 5′-GGCCTTGGCAGGTGTGGGCTCTGG-3′; wild type probe (antisense strand), 5′-CCAGAGCCCACACCTGCCAAGG-3′; competitor probe (sense strand), 5′-CCTTGGCAGGTGTGGGCTCTGG-3′; competitor probe (antisense strand), 5′-CCAGAGCCCACACCTGCCAAGG-3′; mutant probe (sense strand), 5′-GGCCTTGGAAAAAATGGGCTCTGG-3′; mutant probe (antisense strand), 5′-CCAGAGCCCATTTTTTCCAAGG-3′. The single-stranded sense and antisense oligonucleotides were annealed in equimolar amounts. The double-stranded wild type probe and mutant probe were subsequently labeled using Klenow DNA polymerase and [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Science). The labeled oligonucleotides were separated from the unincorporated nucleotides using a Sephadex G-50 gravity flow column (Amersham Biosciences). Aliquots of 10,000 cpm of the probe were incubated with 2 μg of nuclear protein for 30 min on ice in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 150 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ZnCl2, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 100 ng of poly(dI-dC) (Roche Applied Science). Subsequently, 1.0 μl of the probe (100,000 cpm) was added and incubated for 30 min on ice. For supershift experiments, 200 ng of the anti-HA antibody (Y-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or the rabbit IgG was incubated with the nuclear extract for an additional 20 min prior to the addition of the labeled probe. HA-Snail plasmid was kindly provided by A. G. Herreros. For competition assay, a 50-fold molar excess of the indicated unlabeled double-stranded competitor oligonucleotides was preincubated with the nuclear extracts in the binding reaction prior to the addition of the probe. In all cases, the final binding reaction mixture was loaded onto a 5% non-denaturing acrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-borate/EDTA electrophoresis buffer and electrophoresed at 150 V. Gels were dried and analyzed using a phosphorimaging device (Packard). Western Blotting—ATDC5 cells were transfected with 12 μg of DNA in a 10-cm dish or 2 μg of DNA in a 6-well plate using FuGENE 6. At 48 h after the transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed in sample buffer and sheared by passing through a 22-gauge needle. Samples were mixed with loading buffer and separated on a SDS 10% polyacrylamide gel, then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by electro-blotting. Detection was performed using a polyclonal anti-HA antibody (Y-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) against HA epitope and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The bands were visualized with the enhancer chemiluminescence protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of Snail, Slug, and Type II Collagen mRNAs During Chondrocyte Differentiation in the Growth Plate—We examined the mRNA expression of Snail, Slug, and collagen type II during chondrocyte differentiation by in situ hybridization. In the growth plate, the sequential steps in differentiation of chondrocytes are easily distinguished in sections stained with Hematoxylin-Eosin. The chondrocytes are categorized into four types, resting, proliferating, prehypertrophic, and hypertrophic chondrocyte. In situ hybridization revealed that both Snail and Slug were highly expressed in the hypertrophic chondrocytes in the limb of day 16 mouse embryos, whereas the expression level was low in resting and proliferating chondrocytes (Fig. 1, A, B, D, and E). The profile of expression in the hypertrophic chondrocyte differed slightly between Snail and Slug in that Slug expression is confined to a narrower zone of early hypertrophic chondrocytes. Smuc mRNA was expressed not only in hypertrophic chondrocytes but also in skeletal muscles (data not shown). In the spinal cord and mesodermal tissues in the early stages, Snail and Slug riboprobes showed signals, which did not overlap, indicating the specificity of the probes (data not shown). Type II collagen mRNA was expressed in proliferating and prehypertrophic chondrocytes but not in hypertrophic chondrocytes (Fig. 1, H–I, and Ref. 44Mayor R. Guerrero N. Young R.M. Gomez-Skarmeta J.L. Cuellar C. Mech. Dev. 2000; 97: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The expression of aggrecan mRNA has been also reported to disappear in hypertrophic chondrocytes (1Chen Q. Johnson D.M. Haudenschild D.R. Goetinck P.F. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The Expresson Levels of Snail/Slug and Type II Collagen Are Inversely Changed during Chondrocyte Differentiation in ATDC5 Cells—To explore the function of Snail/Slug transcription repressors during chondrocyte differentiation, we used the mouse chondrogenic cell line ATDC5. This cell line has been well characterized and shown to be a model for studying gene expression and morphological changes during the normal differentiation of precursor mesenchymal cells into terminally differentiated chondrocytes (31Atsumi T. Miwa Y. Ikawa Y. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 30: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 32Newman B. Gigout L.I. Sundre L. Grant M.E. Wallis G.A. J.

With insulin supplementation, the ATDC cells form discrete condensations and express type II collagen in confluent monolayer culture. The condensed cells further differentiate to form cartilage nodules and to express type X collagen, a marker for fully differentiated chondrocytes. In three-dimension culture systems, once dedifferentiated primary chondrocytes cultured in monolayers recover the chondrocyte phenotype. Therefore three-dimension culture is thought to mimic the situation in vivo better than monolayer culture. We used an alginate beads culture system (38Bonaventure J. Kadhom N. Cohen-Solal L. Ng K.H.

Cell Res. 1996; 225: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) in which the ATDC5 cells are embedded in alginate beads and cultured with insulin. After 2 days in the three-dimension culture, ATDC5 cells started to express type II collagen mRNA, which is a hallmark of chondrocyte differentiation (Fig. 2A). In monolayer cultures of ATDC5 cells, chondrocytes form few condensations and only a minor expression of type II collagen mRNA was detected 4 days after confluence (32Newman B. Gigout L.I. Sundre L. Grant M.E. Wallis G.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 37Shukunami C. Ishizeki K. Atsumi T. Ohta Y. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Bone Mine Res. 1997; 12: 1174-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Therefore, this three-dimension culture system using ATDC5 cells is a useful in vitro system with which to study chondrocyte differentiation. We examined the expression of Snail family transcription repressor mRNAs by Northern hybridization during the differentiation of ATDC5 cells. In subconfluent monolayer cultures, mRNAs of chondrocyte differentiation markers, type II collagen, PTH/PTHrP receptor, and Sox9, were undetectable (36Shukunami C. Shigeno C. Atsumi T. Ishizeki K. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 133: 457-468Google Scholar, 37Shukunami C. Ishizeki K. Atsumi T. Ohta Y. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J.

Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). Two days after initiating the three-dimension culture, chondrocyte differentiation markers were detected (Fig. 2A). After 4 days of culture, the level of type II collagen and PTH/PTHrP receptor mRNA were enforced, whereas the levels of Snail and Slug mRNA were reduced to 60 and 50%, respectively, when quantified with phosphorimaging. These results show inverse correlation of expression levels between Snail/Slug mRNA and type II collagen mRNA during chondrocyte differentiation in vitro. Smuc mRNA was not detected in ATDC5 cells by Northern blotting.

Most secretory and membrane proteins are synthesized as preproteins with an N-terminal signal peptide (SP) 1The abbreviations used are: SP, signal peptide; SPP, signal peptide peptidase; pGP-C, pre-glycoprotein C; pGP-C-HA, C-terminal HA-tagged pGP-C; pGP-C142, truncated (amino acid residues 1–142) pGP-C; SPGP-C, signal peptide of pGP-C; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HA, hemagglutinin; HCMV, human cytomegalovirus; LCMV (WE), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus strain WE; gp, glycoprotein; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; HIV-1 gp160, glycoprotein 160 of HIV-1; PNGase F, protein N-glycanase F; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.1The abbreviations used are: SP, signal peptide; SPP, signal peptide peptidase; pGP-C, pre-glycoprotein C; pGP-C-HA, C-terminal HA-tagged pGP-C; pGP-C142, truncated (amino acid residues 1–142) pGP-C; SPGP-C, signal peptide of pGP-C; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HA, hemagglutinin; HCMV, human cytomegalovirus; LCMV (WE), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus strain WE; gp, glycoprotein; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; HIV-1 gp160, glycoprotein 160 of HIV-1; PNGase F, protein N-glycanase F; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.

Membrane Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Signal peptides are usually 15–25 amino acid residues in length and are typically comprised of three distinct regions: a central hydrophobic core of 7–10 residues (h-region), a polar N-terminal region that can be very variable in length and is usually positively charged, and a C-terminal region that contains the cleavage site for the signal peptidase (3von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, SPs target nascent secretory and membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mediate insertion of the nascent polypeptides into the translocon (4Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Membrane insertion is thought to occur in a loop-like fashion such that the N terminus of the SP is exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Signal peptidase then cleaves the SP on the lumenal side of the membrane (5Blobel G. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 835-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar, 6Martoglio B. Dobberstein B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 410-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Cleavage usually occurs cotranslationally; however in some cases, SP cleavage is delayed or does not occur at all. Delayed cleavage is observed for the US11 SP (7Rehm A. Stern P. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and the SP of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) glycoprotein 160 (gp160) (8Li Y. Bergeron J.J. Luo L. Ou W.J. Thomas D.Y. Kang C.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9606-9611Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The SP of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) US2 gene product is not even cleaved at all (9Gewurz B.E. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11306-11313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses of several preproteins revealed that the efficiency and fidelity of SP cleavage can be influenced by mutations within the signal sequence itself but also by mutations in the mature protein (10Russel M. Model P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11von Heijne G. Eur. J.

Chem. 1988; 263: 15791-15798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After cleavage from the preprotein, SPs are thought to be either directly degraded or processed by signal peptide peptidase (SPP) into distinct fragments that are released from the membrane (13Lyko F. Martoglio B. Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Dobberstein B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19873-19878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Klappa P. Dierks T. Zimmermann R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). SPP has recently been shown to be a presenilin-type intramembrane-cleaving protease (15Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Several determinants for processing by SPP have been identified: the SP has to be cleaved from the preprotein and the hydrophobic core region has to contain helix-breaking residues. Moreover, as yet ill-defined features of the SP flanking regions can affect SP processing (16Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). SP fragments resulting from processing by SPP can be functionally active. In the case of the hormone preprolactin and the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) gp160, the N-terminal portion of the respective SP is released into the cytosol and binds to calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner (17Martoglio B. Graf R. Dobberstein B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6636-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This implies that these SP-derived fragments may influence signal transduction pathways in the cell (17Martoglio B. Graf R. Dobberstein B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6636-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). SPs can also play a role in immunorecognition. SPs of the polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules contain a highly conserved sequence that is capable of binding to nonpolymorphic MHC class I molecules (HLA-E in human) (18Braud V. Jones E.Y. McMichael A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1164-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The peptide-HLA-E complex interacts at the cell surface with an inhibitory receptor on natural killer cells and thereby monitors the level of MHC class I molecule expression (19Braud V.M. Allan D.S. O'Callaghan C.A. Soderstrom K. D'Andrea A. Ogg G.S. Lazetic S. Young N.T. Bell J.I. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. McMichael A.J. Nature. 1998; 391: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1750) Google Scholar). Presentation of the SP-derived epitope is dependent on the transporter associated with antigen processing that transports peptides generated by the proteasome into the ER lumen (20Bai A. Forman J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2139-2146PubMed Google Scholar). The glycoproteins (GP-1 and GP-2) of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) are synthesized as a type I precursor glycoprotein C (pGP-C) that is processed during intracellular transport into GP-1 and GP-2 (21Burns J.W. Buchmeier M.J. Salvato M.S. The Arenaviridae. Plenum Press, New York1993: 17-35Crossref Google Scholar). The predicted SP of LCMV pGP-C (SPGP-C) is rather unusual: it is longer than average SPs, comprising 58 amino acid residues, and has two hydrophobic regions separated by a lysine residue. An epitope derived from the core region, amino acid residues 33–41/43 of the SPGP-C (gp33), is presented by MHC class I molecules to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (21Burns J.W. Buchmeier M.J. Salvato M.S. The Arenaviridae. Plenum Press, New York1993: 17-35Crossref Google Scholar, 22Klavinskis L.S. Whitton J.L. Joly E. Oldstone M.B.

Pircher H. Tonegawa S. Zinkernagel R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1615-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and proteasome activity (26Gallimore A. Schwarz K. van den Broek M. Hengartner H. Groettrup M. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We have investigated the cleavage and fate of the SPGP-C in transfected and LCMV-infected cells. Plasmids—The expression plasmid pSV51l/pGP-C was derived from the widely used original cDNA of LCMV (WE) S RNA (27Romanowski V. Matsuura Y. Bishop D.H. Virus Res. 1985; 3: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and the pSV51l expression vector (28Huylebroeck D. Maertens G. Verhoeyen M. Lopez C. Raeymakers A. Jou W.M. Fiers W. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 163-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment including the entire coding region for LCMV (WE) pGP-C (GenBank™ accession number M22138: base pairs 17–1,579) was cloned into pSV51l using an additionally introduced BamHI site (pSV51l/pGP-C). A DNA fragment encoding pGP-C-HA was generated by polymerase chain reaction using the forward primer 5′-GGA TCT CTA GAG TCG ACC CC-3′ and the backward primer 5′-CTG GAT CCT CAA GCG TAA TCT GGA ACA TCG TAT GGG TAG CGT CTT TTC CAG ATA G-3′. The PCR product was inserted into the BamHI site of pSV51l (pSV51l/pGP-C-HA). Cells and Virus—HeLa and L929 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). MC57 cells have been described previously (29Aden D.P. Knowles B.B. Immunogenetics. 1976; 3: 209Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). HeLa, MC57, and L929 cells were grown under recommended conditions. The LCMV (WE) strain was originally obtained from F. Lehmann-Grube (30Lehmann-Grube F. Virol. Monogr. 1971; 10: 1Google Scholar). Peptides and Antibodies—Synthetic peptides deduced from the SPGP-C and including amino acid residues 7–18 (MFEALPHIIDEV, SP7), 30–41 (TSIKAVYNFATC, SP30), and 48–57 (SFLFLAGRSC, SP48) were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into rabbits to raise anti-SP7, -SP30, and -SP48 antibodies. Antisera were immunopurified. KL25 is a mouse monoclonal antibody reactive with the LCMV glycoprotein GP-1 (31Bruns M. Cihak J. Muller G. Lehmann-Grube F. Virology. 1983; 130: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Transfection, Infection, and LCMV Particle Preparation—Expression vectors were transfected into HeLa cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method for 20–24 h (32Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The cells were grown for an additional 48 h. MC57 cells were infected for 24 h with LCMV (WE) (multiplicity of infection, 0.05). LCMV particles were prepared as described (33Buchmeier M.J. Elder J.H. Oldstone M.B. Virology. 1978; 89: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) without using a continuous sucrose gradient. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—After transfection, about 1 × 106 cells were starved in Met/Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum for 150 min at 37 °C and labeled with 0.15 mCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys for 30 min. Labeling medium was removed, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and either directly analyzed or chased in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for the indicated time periods. Cells were harvested and lysed for 15 min on ice in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.3), 5 mm MgCl2, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin. Equal aliquots were used for immunoprecipitation (34Lipp J. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1986; 46: 1103-1112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). After infection 2 × 106 confluent cells were starved in Met/Cys-free RPMI 1640 plus 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum for 45 min at 37 °C and labeled with 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys for 60 min. Labeling medium was removed, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and chased in complete medium for the indicated time periods. Cells were harvested and lysed for 45 min on ice in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.85 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 2.8 μm pepstatin, 0.75 μm aprotinin, and 2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. Equal aliquots were used for immunoprecipitation. The beads were boiled in the appropriate sample buffer (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207139) Google Scholar, 36Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10475) Google Scholar), and proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by phosphorimaging using a BAS 1500 (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). Protein amounts have been quantified using MacBas2.0 program. Cell Fractionation and Treatments of Isolated Membranes—Transfected HeLa cells were harvested, resuspended in 20 volumes of hypotonic buffer (5 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin), incubated on ice for 10 min, and broken up by using a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was adjusted to 0.25 m sucrose and centrifuged at 4 °C, 13,800 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was loaded on a high salt sucrose cushion (500 mm sucrose, 500 mm KOAc, 50 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.6), 2 mm MgOAc, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 4 °C, 100,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellet (membranes) was resuspended in hypotonic buffer, adjusted to 100 mm NaCl and 0.25 m sucrose, and aliquots were treated on ice with different combinations of 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K, 0.5 mg/ml trypsin, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, or increasing concentrations of SDS (0.2, 0.5, and 1.0%) as indicated in the legend for Fig. 4. For carbonate extraction, one aliquot of membranes was treated with 1/10 volume of 1 m Na2CO3 (pH 11) for 15 min on ice and loaded on a sucrose cushion (250 mm sucrose, 100 mm Na2CO3, pH 11). After centrifugation (4 °C, 130,000 × g, 10 min), the supernatant was taken off, and the pellet was resuspended in hypotonic buffer adjusted to 100 mm NaCl and 0.25 m sucrose. PNGase F Treatment of Immunoprecipitated Proteins—Immunoprecipitated proteins bound to resin were incubated with 100 units of PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Schwalbach, Germany) in a final volume of 30 μl as specified by the supplier and incubated for 12 h at 37 °C. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins of total cell lysates, fractions of membranes, cytosol, or LCMV particles were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and identified using anti-SP7, anti-Sec61β, or anti-α-tubulin antibodies by standard Western blot analysis technique (32Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Characterization of Antibodies Directed against the pGP-C Signal Peptide (SPGP-C)—To characterize the SP of the LCMV glycoprotein pGP-C (SPGP-C) (Fig. 1A), antibodies against three different segments of the SPGP-C were raised in rabbits. The peptides used for immunization comprised amino acid residues 7–18 (SP7), 30–41 (SP30), and 48–57 (SP48) (Fig. 1B). Antibodies were affinity-purified and used to immunoprecipitate a fragment of pGP-C, comprising amino acid residues 1–142 (pGP-C142) (Fig. 1A), which was synthesized in vitro. An aliquot of the translation reaction (Fig. 1C, lane 1) and the immunoprecipitates (lanes 2–13) were separated by SDS-PAGE, and pGP-C142 was visualized by phosphorimaging. Only the anti-SP7 antibody was able to immunoprecipitate pGP-C142 (Fig. 1C, lane 2). The specificity of the reaction was demonstrated by the addition of the SP7 or an unrelated (control) peptide. No immunoprecipitation is seen when the specific peptide SP7 is included in the reaction (lane 3), whereas a control peptide had no effect (lane 4). The preimmune serum did not immunoprecipitate pGP-C142 (lane 5). Antibodies raised against the other two SP peptides, SP30 and SP48, did not immunoprecipitate pGP-C142 (lanes 6–13). Anti-SP7 antibody was used for the further studies. Identification of (p)GP-C-HA and SP Cleavage from pGP-C— SPs are usually cleaved very rapidly after their membrane insertion from the nascent or just completed secretory or membrane protein. To follow cleavage of the SPGP-C from pGP-C, we initially used a cell-free system in which pGP-C142 was synthesized in the presence of rough microsomal membranes (13Lyko F. Martoglio B. Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Dobberstein B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19873-19878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the SPGP-C from pGP-C142 was very inefficient as compared with SP cleavage from the secretory protein preprolactin (data not shown). We therefore reasoned that SPGP-C cleavage from pGP-C might be inherently inefficient. To test this hypothesis, we transfected HeLa cells with a plasmid expressing HA epitope-tagged LCMV pGP-C (pGP-C-HA) (Fig. 1A). Cells were labeled with [35S]Met/Cys for 30 min. The extract was treated with PNGase F to remove N-linked carbohydrates from pGP-C-HA and thereby obtain a more distinct banding pattern. Unglycosylated (p)GP-C-HA ((p)GP-C-HA*) was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA or anti-SP7 antibodies (Fig. 2A). Both antibodies immunoprecipitated a major band of about 55 kDa, the expected molecular mass of unglycosylated (p)GP-C-HA, (p)GP-C-HA* (lanes 3 and 4). In the anti-HA immunoprecipitates, we cannot detect a smaller form representing mature GP-C-HA*, suggesting either that pGP-C-HA* and GP-C-HA* are not resolved by the gel system used or that GP-C-HA* is degraded. In addition, the anti-SP7 antibody immunoprecipitates a peptide of about 6 kDa. The 6-kDa peptide comigrates with in vitro synthesized SPGP-C comprising the N-terminal 58 amino acid residues of pGP-C (SP58) (Fig. 2B, lane 2). This suggests that the complete SPGP-C accumulates. To investigate whether the SPGP-C is stable enough to be detected under steady state conditions, we used Western blotting. A cell extract from transfected HeLa cells was separated on an SDS-PAGE Tricine gel that separates peptides with high resolution, and a Western blot was probed with the anti-SP7 antibody. As can be seen in Fig. 2C, the SPGP-C can be detected in cells expressing pGP-C-HA (lane 2) but not in cells transfected with the empty vector (lane 1). Stability of the Cleaved SPGP-C—To follow cleavage of the SPGP-C from pGP-C-HA, we pulse-labeled transfected HeLa cells for 30 min and chased them with medium containing unlabelled amino acids for 3 and 6 h (Fig. 3A). Aliquots of the samples were treated with PNGase F as indicated in the figure. The anti-SP7 antibody was used to immunoprecipitate pGP-C-HA and the cleaved SPGP-C. SP7 or control peptides were added to the samples as indicated. After the labeling and PNGase F treatment, the 55-kDa pGP-C-HA* and a prominent small peptide are immunoprecipitated with the anti-SP7 antibody (Fig. 3A, lane 4). Both, the 55-kDa protein and the 6-kDa peptide (SPGP-C) are no longer immunoprecipitated when the SP7 peptide is included in the immunoprecipitation (lanes 7 and 8). During the 3- and 6-h chase period, the amount of the 55-kDa protein is substantially reduced, whereas the amount of SPGP-C is not markedly altered (lanes 4, 10, and 16). To expand the chase times and see whether the HA tag affects the stability of pGP-C or the SPGP-C, we expressed pGP-C as described above but used chase times of 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. To rule out the possibility that SPGP-C migrates at the gel front, we again used the SDS-PAGE Tricine gel system that separates peptides with high resolution. SPGP-C immunoprecipitated by the anti-SP7 antibody is still detectable after 24 h of chase labeling (Fig. 3B). From a quantification of the amount of SPGP-C detectable at the chase times, we calculated a half-life of more than 6 h for SPGP-C (Fig. 3C). Membrane Association and Protease Sensitivity of SPGP-C— To investigate the membrane association of SPGP-C, we pulse-labeled transfected cells and prepared a cytoplasmic and membrane fraction by centrifugation of a cell homogenate. As markers for cytosol and ER membranes, antibodies against α-tubulin and Sec61β were used, respectively (see supplementary data, Fig. 1S). SPGP-C was exclusively found in the membrane fraction (Fig. 4, cf. lanes 2 and 3). Carbonate (pH 11) extraction was also not able to remove SPGP-C from the membrane fraction (cf. lanes 10 and 11). To test whether the SPGP-C was accessible on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, proteinase K was added to the membrane and cytoplasmic fractions. Neither proteinase K (lanes 4 and 5) nor trypsin (data not shown) were able to cleave the SPGP-C. To see whether the resistance against protease digestion was due to the membrane barrier or is an intrinsic property of the SPGP-C, we solubilized the membranes with either the nondenaturing detergent Triton X-100 or increasing concentrations (0.2, 0.5, and 1.0%) of SDS (30 min on ice). Although pGP-C-HA was digested under these conditions, SPGP-C was not (lanes 6–9). SPGP-C after Infection with LCMV—To investigate the cleavage and fate of SPGP-C during viral biogenesis and maturation, we infected MC57 mouse fibroblasts with LCMV. 24 h after infection, cells were labeled with [35S]Met/Cys for 60 min and chased for 3 or 6 h with medium containing nonlabeled amino acids. An antibody recognizing an epitope in the mature GP-1 protein (KL25) and the anti-SP7 antibody were used in immunoprecipitations. As compared with the noninfected cells (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2), an intensively labeled protein of about 70 kDa was immunoprecipitated with the KL25 antibody as well as the anti-SP7 antibody (lanes 3–8). The amount of this protein was reduced at the 3 and 6 h chase times. The size of this protein (70 kDa) and the fact that the protein is immunoprecipitated by KL25 as well as the SP7 antibody suggests that it is mainly pGP-C. Cleaved SPGP-C is clearly detectable in anti-SP7 immunoprecipitates even after 6 h of chase (lanes 6–8). Thus the high stability of the SPGP-C is not restricted to transfected cells but is also a property of the SPGP-C during virus infection. To see whether the cleaved SPGP-C also accumulates in the virus, we purified LCMV particles from culture supernatants of acute infected L929 cells and identified the SPGP-C by using the anti-SP7 antibody and Western blot analysis. As can be seen in Fig. 6, the SPGP-C is detected in the infected cells (lane 2) as well as in the purified LCMV particles (lanes 4 and 5). The SPGP-C comigrates with in vitro synthesized SPGP-C (SP58), indicating that the entire SP accumulates (cf. lanes 3 and 4). The purity of the virus particle preparation is indicated by the absence of the cellular 50-kDa protein cross-reacting with the anti-SP7 antibody (cf. Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2 with lane 5). Furthermore, a marker protein for the ER, Sec61β, could not be detected in the LCMV particle preparation (see supplementary data, Fig. 2S). In infected cells, the anti-SP7 antibody recognized a peptide smaller than SPGP-C by about 1–2 kDa. This peptide might represent an SPP processing product of the SPGP-C (15Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Signal peptides are usually cleaved from their preprotein shortly after membrane insertion and are then rapidly proteolytically processed and/or degraded (3von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar, 6Martoglio B. Dobberstein B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 410-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The SP of LCMV pGP-C is different with respect to cleavage from the preprotein and its processing and degradation (for a schematic representation, see Fig. 7). The SPGP-C is not cleaved from all glycoprotein molecules, and pGP-C accumulates for several hours in transfected and infected cells. More unexpected is that the cleaved SPGP-C is unusually stable, having a half-life of more than 6 h, and accumulates in LCMV particles. SPGP-C Cleavage from pGP-C—We raised an antibody (anti-SP7) that specifically recognizes the signal peptide of LCMV pGP-C. Specificity was demonstrated by using competing and control peptides in immunoprecipitations. In transfected and LCMV-infected cells, pGP-C and the cleaved signal peptide SPGP-C could be detected and found to be rather long-lived. We were unable to resolve or detect mature GP-C. This may be due to the gel system used or may indicate degradation of GP-C. The recombinant LCMV (WE) pGP-C we used in this study is derived from persistent infected cells. During progression from acute to persistent infection, pGP-C accumulates 12 point mutations (between amino acids 94 and 457), which are exclusively found in the mature part of the glycoprotein but not in its signal peptide (amino acids 1–58). One (L110P) of these point mutations prevents processing into GP-1 and GP-2 (37Beyer W.R. Miletic H. Ostertag W. von Laer D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1061-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, accumulation of pGP-C and SPGP-C is also seen in acute infected cells and therefore reflects an intrinsic property of pGP-C and is not due to the mutations accumulating in GP-C in persistent infected cells. Inefficient SP cleavage has also been found for some other viral membrane proteins. A fraction of newly synthesized HCMV US11 molecules retains the SP after the US11 has been completed (7Rehm A. Stern P. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Delayed cleavage is caused by amino acid residues in the N-terminal part of the US11 SP. A second region that affects the rate and extent of SP cleavage is the transmembrane region of US11 (7Rehm A. Stern P. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A precursor form of the HIV-1 gp160 has also been found to accumulate. In this case, the SP cleavage has been shown to be a prerequisite for intracellular transport of gp160. The SP of pre-gp160 interferes with gp160 folding and surface expression (8Li Y. Bergeron J.J. Luo L. Ou W.J. Thomas D.Y. Kang C.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9606-9611Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 38Li Y. Luo L. Thomas D.Y. Kang C.Y. Virology. 2000; 272: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Whether similar functions can be assigned to the SPGP-C awaits further experimentation. SPGP-C Accumulation in Infected Cells and in LCMV Particles—In contrast to other SPs, the cleaved SPGP-C is not rapidly processed and degraded. It accumulates in transfected cells expressing pGP-C as well as in LCMV-infected cells producing virus particles. Stability is thus not dependent on other factors encoded by the viral genome. The basis for the high stability of the SPGP-C probably lies in the structural features of SPGP-C. Although an average signal peptide comprises about 20 amino acid residues, the SPGP-C extends over 58 amino acid residues and is characterized by two hydrophobic regions separated by a lysine residue (Fig. 1B). The N-terminal h1 region includes 15 uncharged amino acid residues, of which 11 are hydrophobic. The h2 region contains 20 uncharged amino acid residues. Membrane insertion of signal peptides of a secretory or type I membrane protein is thought to occur in a loop-like fashion such that the N terminus is exposed on the cytoplasmic side, and the cleavage site for signal peptidase is exposed on the lumenal side (Fig. 7). Given that the two hydrophobic regions of SPGP-C are both of sufficient length and hydrophobicity to span the membrane, it is well conceivable that SPGP-C spans the membrane twice. We have demonstrated using carbonate extraction that all SPGP-C peptides are integrated in the membrane. As cleavage sites of signal peptidase are usually in proximity to the hydrophobic segment of a signal peptide, we consider it very likely that the h2 region spans the membrane during membrane insertion such that signal peptidase has access to the cleavage site on the lumenal side of the ER. The h1 region is also of sufficient hydrophobicity to span the membrane. If this is true, the N terminus would have to translocate across the membrane, and the h1 and h2 regions would span the membrane in antiparallel configuration (Fig. 7). Several observations argue for such a configuration: 1) Protease added to membrane vesicles does not cleave the SPGP-C. If only the h2 region would span the membrane, the more than 30 amino acid residues of the N terminus would be exposed on the cytoplasmic side accessible to the added protease. 2) The SPGP-C is very resistant to proteolysis even in the presence of detergents, suggesting a compact structure as formed in the suggested antiparallel configuration of the two h regions. 3) The N-terminal hydrophilic region contains an excess of acidic amino acid residues over basic ones. A statistical analysis has revealed that clusters of positively charged amino acid residues are mostly found on the cytoplasmic side of membrane-spanning proteins (39Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). As judged by this criterion, the slightly negatively charged N-terminal region of the SPGP-C would be compatible with translocation across the ER membrane. An unusually long and stable SP has also been found for the foamy virus envelope glycoprotein (Env) (40Lindemann D. Pietschmann T. Picard-Maureau M. Berg A. Heinkelein M. Thurow J. Knaus P. Zentgraf H. Rethwilm A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5762-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The foamy virus SPEnv is 148 amino acid residues in length and contains a single hydrophobic region located between residues 70 and 90. This SP becomes glycosylated and is found in virus particles. What structural features of this SP prevent proteolytic processing and rapid degradation is not yet known. Possible Implications of SPGP-C Cleavage and Stability— What relevance could the accumulation of pGP-C and the rather stable SPGP-C have for the LCMV life cycle? pGP-C might represent a biosynthetic intermediate that could be converted posttranslationally to transport competent GP-C by cleavage of the SP. Alternatively, pGP-C might be a substrate for the ER-associated degradation system. Clearly, further work is required to distinguish between these two or other possibilities. LCMV is the prototype of the arenaviridae. Glycoproteins of other arenaviridae are synthesized with SPs of similar length. In addition, these SPs show sequence similarity and also contain two hydrophobic segments separated by one or two positively charged amino acid residues (see supplementary data, Fig. 3S). Cleavage of Lassa virus signal peptide was recently shown to be necessary for GP-C processing into GP-1 and GP-2 and maturation in the secretory pathway (41Eichler R. Lenz O. Strecker T. Garten W. FEBS Lett. 2003; 538: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The unusual stability and accumulation of SPGP-C strongly argues for functions besides targeting to the ER membrane. An attractive hypothesis would be that SPGP-C plays a role for virus assembly or formation and stabilization of the virus particle itself. Our finding that SPGP-C is present in purified virus particles in substantial amounts supports such a notion. A striking biosynthetic and structural similarity can be found between the SPGP-C and the 6K peptide of Semliki Forest virus and Sindbis virus (42Garoff H. Kondor-Koch C. Riedel H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1982; 99: 1-50PubMed Google Scholar). The 6K peptides of these viruses are synthesized as part of a polyprotein between the two glycoproteins P62 and E1 and are excised by two proteases to give the final 6K products. The 6K peptides comprise 55–58 amino acid residues and have an acidic, hydrophilic N-terminal region and two hydrophobic segments interrupted by 1 or 2 basic amino acid residues. 6K, like SPGP-C, is thought to be cleaved at its C-terminal side by signal peptidase (42Garoff H. Kondor-Koch C. Riedel H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1982; 99: 1-50PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that Semliki Forest virus 6K is required for efficient virus budding and is found in the virus in submolar amounts (43Gaedigk-Nitschko K. Ding M.X. Levy M.A. Schlesinger M.J. Virology. 1990; 175: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 44Liljestrom P. Lusa S. Huylebroeck D. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4107-4113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Lusa S.

A function in virus budding and integration into virus particles has also been shown for the SP of foamy virus Env protein (40Lindemann D. Pietschmann T. Picard-Maureau M. Berg A. Heinkelein M. Thurow J. Knaus P. Zentgraf H. Rethwilm A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5762-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, this SP does not share many structural similarities with the SPGP-C. The signal peptide of pGP-C contains the immunodominant MHC class I restricted T cell epitope (gp33) comprising amino acid residues 33–41/43 (23Buchmeier M.J. Zinkernagel R.M. Science. 1992; 257: 1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 24Hudrisier D. Oldstone M.B. Gairin J.E. Virology. 1997; 234: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A quite obvious consequence of SPGP-C stability is that the T cell epitope will not directly be released, and thus the T cell response will be delayed. Generation of the SPGP-C-derived T cell epitope requires a functional proteasome, suggesting that the SPGP-C is eventually released from the membrane into the cytosol, where it becomes proteolytically processed (26Gallimore A. Schwarz K. van den Broek M. Hengartner H. Groettrup M. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Whether processing of cleaved SPGP-C is relevant for generating the gp33 T cell epitope is unclear. Alternatively, mistargeted pGP-C accumulating during biosynthesis in the cytosol may be degraded by the proteasome and generate the gp33 T cell epitope. Work described here strongly suggests that the SP of pGP-C is more than a targeting device to the ER. It may function at further stages of the LCMV life cycle.

https://openalex.org/W2016853351,"We have studied the topogenesis of a class of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins that expose a hydrophilic domain to the cytosol and are anchored to the membrane by a single transmembrane domain in the N-terminal region. To determine the role of these latter sequences in the targeting and insertion of such proteins we took two approaches. First, a functional complementation assay was used to define the structural elements that together with the anchor domain make up the topogenic signal. Moderate hydrophobicity of the transmembrane domain was found to be the most important requirement. Variants with a scrambled sequence of the membrane-spanning segment were only partially functional suggesting that specificity in the amino acid sequence is also of considerable importance. A net positive charge at both flanking regions of the transmembrane domain contributes to the efficiency of targeting and membrane integration but is not an essential structural feature of this signal. Second, chimeras of Tom20, Tom70, and OM45 were generated that contained the cytosolic domain of Tom20 or Tom70 and the anchor domain of one of the other members of the class. These hybrid proteins were able to rescue the growth of cells lacking Tom20 or Tom70. Thus, anchor domains of outer membrane proteins are functionally interchangeable. They play only a minor role in the specific function of these proteins, but have a decisive role in topogenic signaling.

They play only a minor role in the specific function of these proteins, but have a decisive role in topogenic signaling. The targeting of most mitochondrial preproteins is mediated by cleavable N-terminal extensions of about 20–50 amino acid residues (the presequences or matrix-targeting signals), which are necessary and sufficient to direct them into the mitochondria (1Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 2Pfanner N. Geissler A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Yet, all preproteins of the mitochondrial outer membrane are devoid of a typical N-terminal presequence. The targeting information is rather contained in the protein sequence itself. A special class of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins includes those containing a single transmembrane segment at their N-terminal. The three known members of this class are Tom20, Tom70, and OM45 (Fig. 1) (3Shore G.C. McBride H.M. Millar D.G. Steenaart N.A.E. Nguyen M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These proteins are present in the outer membrane in an orientation, where the bulk of the polypeptide is exposed to the cytosol and only a small N-terminal segment crosses the outer membrane. They are called “signal-anchored” proteins since their TMD 1The abbreviations used are: TMD, transmembrane domain; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein. together with its flanking regions serve both as an intracellular sorting signal and as an anchor to the membrane. Tom20 and Tom70 are examples of this class of proteins. They function as receptor proteins that mediate the import of preproteins. Tom20 is involved in the translocation of most protein precursors, in particular those with N-terminal targeting signals (4Harkness T.A. Nargang F.E. van der Klei I. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 5Lithgow T. Glick B.S. Schatz G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 98-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), whereas Tom70 forms a binding site for a more restricted set of preproteins, most notably the mitochondrial carrier family (6Schlossmann J. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11893-11901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Brix J. Rudiger S. Bukau B. Schneider-Mergener J. Pfanner N. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). OM45, another member of this class, is a very abundant protein in the yeast mitochondrial outer membrane whose function, however, is unknown (9Yaffe M.P. Jensen R.E. Guido E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21091-21096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The contribution of the signal-anchor domain to the function of each member of this class of proteins and the structural features that allow it to make this contribution are poorly understood. At present, valuable information is available on the targeting signals of Tom components mainly with mammalian mitochondria (10Suzuki H. Maeda M. Mihara K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1895-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 11Kanaji S. Iwahashi J. Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Despite this progress, however, basic questions remain to be answered. In particular, is the sole task of the membrane anchors and their flanking regions to target the cytosolic moieties to and hold them at the mitochondrial outer membrane, or have these domains also a sequencespecific role in the particular task of the respective protein? What is the nature of the targeting signal? In this study we have used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to obtain a detailed view on the roles of the various structural motifs in the signal-anchor domains. This model organism allows a combination of genetic and cell biological approaches and takes advantage of the extensive existing knowledge on the molecular biology of mitochondrial biogenesis. We have employed an in vivo functional complementation assay which can not only provide information on the correct intracellular sorting of the protein of interest, but can also reveal whether the protein acquired the native topology and is functional. Our results imply that moderate hydrophobicity is the important structural characteristic of a mitochondrial signal-anchor domain. Positively charged amino acid residues in the flanking regions of the membrane-spanning segment enhance targeting and function but are not essential. Remarkably, the signal-anchor domains of Tom20, Tom70, and OM45 are functionally interchangeable. Thus, they appear to play only a limited role, if any, in the distinctive function of these proteins. Their main task seems to be targeting the functional domain of the protein to the mitochondria and placing them on the surface of the outer membrane. These results imply that Tom20 and Tom70 are recruited to the TOM complex via their cytosolic domains. Yeast Strains and Growth Methods—Standard genetic techniques were used for growth and manipulation of yeast strains (12Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1986Google Scholar). Transformation of yeast was carried out using the lithium acetate method. Yeast cells were grown under aerobic conditions on YPD (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bactopeptone, 2% glucose) or on YPG (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bactopeptone, 3% glycerol) medium. For plate tests cells were grown to log phase in synthetic medium or synthetic medium lacking uracil (SD-Ura) and diluted in SD-Ura medium to an OD600 of 0.5. Cells were then diluted in 10-fold increments, and 5 μl of each was spotted onto the indicated solid media. The tom20-null strain YTJB64 and its corresponding parental strain YTJB4 were used (kind gift of Drs. G. Schatz and C. Koehler) (13Lithgow T. Junne T. Wachter C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15325-15330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For checking functionality of Tom70 variants the JY009 strain was used (14Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.-U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Recombinant DNA Techniques—For in vitro transcription and translation of OM45, the OM45 open reading frame was amplified by PCR from genomic yeast DNA. The resulting product was digested with BamHI and PstI and cloned into the BamHI/PstI sites of pGEM4 vector (Promega, Madison, WI). For expression of OM45-(1–32)-GFP in yeast cells, the sequence encoding the N-terminal 32 amino acid residues of OM45 was amplified by PCR, treated with EcoRI and BamHI, and subcloned into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pYX232-mtGFP (15Westermann B. Neupert W. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Tom20 variants were constructed by standard molecular biology techniques and were introduced into the multicopy plasmid, pRS426xTPIp-URA3 (kind gift of Dr. K. Dietmeier). The scrambled variants of Tom20 were constructed by PCR using a primer encoding the scrambled sequence. Few variants were also cloned into the yeast expression vector pRS416 where the protein was expressed under the endogenous promoter of TOM20. In those cases similar results were obtained with both types of plasmids. Tom70 variants were introduced into the multicopy plasmid, pYX142 (Invitrogene). Wild-type TOM70 in pRS315 vector was a kind gift of Dr. Jason Young (14Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.-U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Biochemical Methods—Mitochondria for in vitro import experiments were prepared by differential centrifugation as described (16Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequential isolation of mitochondria and ER from yeast cells was performed according to published procedure (17Meisinger C. Sommer T. Pfanner N. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Lysate of yeast cells was centrifuged twice at 1500 × g to remove cell debris and nuclei. The clarified lysate was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g yielding crude mitochondria in the pellet. The supernatant of this step was centrifuged at 100,000 × g resulting in a pellet enriched in ER and a supernatant containing cytosolic proteins. Crude mitochondria were resuspended in sucrose containing buffer and another centrifugation step (2000 × g) was performed to remove residual impurities. The supernatant of this latter step was further treated as described. Radiolabeled precursor proteins were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) after in vitro transcription by SP6 polymerase from pGEM4 vectors containing the gene of interest. Import experiments were performed in a buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, 2 mm NADH, 2 mm ATP, pH 7.2. In some cases carbonate extraction was performed to determine whether imported precursor proteins were inserted into membranes. This extraction was done in combination with sucrose flotation gradients to avoid the possibility of having non-integrated protein aggregates pelleting with membranes (18Rapaport D. Taylor R.D. Käser M. Langer T. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1189-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation, samples after import of radiolabeled precursors were dissolved in lysis buffer (3% bovine serum albumin, 1% digitonin, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2). After a clarifying spin (20 min, 36,700 × g), the supernatants were incubated with antibodies that were precoupled to protein A-Sepharose beads. Blue Native Gel Electrophoresis (BNGE)—Mitochondria (50 μg) were lysed in 50 μl of detergent-containing buffer (0.7% digitonin or 0.2% dodecylmaltoside in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4). After incubation at 4 °C for 10 min and a clarifying spin (20 min, 36,700 × g), 5 μl of sample buffer (5% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, 100 mm Bis-Tris, 500 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, pH 7.0) were added, and the mixture was analyzed on a 6–13% gradient blue native gel (19Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Characterization of the Targeting Signal of Tom20 —To characterize the targeting and membrane-integration information within signal-anchored proteins we used an in vivo functional complementation assay. Deletion of the gene encoding Tom20 in yeast was reported to result in cells that cannot grow on a non-fermentable carbon source (20Ramage L. Junne T. Hahne K. Lithgow T. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4115-4123Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 21Iwahashi J. Yamazaki S. Komiya T. Nomura N. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18467-18472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We observed slight growth of tom20-null strain on glycerol at 30 °C (not shown), but no growth was observed at 15 °C (Fig. 2A). Therefore, we used the ability of Tom20 variants to complement the growth phenotype at 15 °C as a measure of correct targeting to and function in the TOM complex. First, we verified that transforming tom20-null strain with yeast expression vector containing the gene encoding Tom20 can rescue the tom20-null phenotype (Fig. 2A). This result shows that pre-existing Tom20 is not absolutely required for the correct import of newly synthesized Tom20 precursors. In agreement with this, import in vitro of newly synthesized Tom20 was found not to be dependent on the presence of cytosolic domains of import receptors (22Schneider H. Sollner T. Dietmeier K. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Trulzsch B. Neupert W. Pfanner N. Science. 1991; 254: 1659-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Expression of a Tom20 variant that lacked the signal-anchor domain (residues 1–36) did not restore growth on a non-fermentable carbon source (Fig. 2A, Tom20(cyt)). Thus, the signal-anchor domain is essential for the function of Tom20. Do specific amino acid residues in the N-terminal flanking region of the transmembrane domain contribute to targeting and anchoring to the mitochondrial outer membrane? The N-terminal flanking region of Tom20 contains two hydroxylated amino acid residues, Ser-2 and Ser-4. Hydroxylated residues are also found in the N-terminal flanking region of other signalanchored proteins like OM45 and Tom70 (Fig. 1). To determine the importance of these residues we constructed a protein where the first six amino acid residues were deleted, Tom20(Δ1–6). This variant facilitated growth on glycerol (Fig. 2A). Hence, residues 1–6 are not essential for targeting to and function within mitochondria. The importance of the positive charge of Arg-9 was tested by introducing a negatively charged residue in this position and thereby changing the net charge at the N-terminal flanking region from +1 to -1. This mutation did not interfere with targeting and function of Tom20 when present either in the native protein (Tom20R9E) or in the variant lacking the first six amino acid residues (Tom20Δ1–6, R9D)(Fig. 2A). It appears that specific residues in the N-terminal flanking region are not essential for targeting and function. Are the positively charged residues at the C-terminal flanking region crucial for targeting and function? The two arginine residues, Arg-33 and Arg-34, were replaced by glutamine residues resulting in a net one negative charge in this region. The resulting Tom20 variant (Tom20-R33Q/R34Q) supported growth on glycerol, although to a much lesser extent (Fig. 2B). Faster growth, as compared with the latter strain, was observed when the net charge in the C-terminal flanking region was made neutral by mutating, in addition to Arg-33 and Arg-34, also Asp-30 to a glutamine residue (Tom20-D30Q/R33Q/R34Q) (Fig. 2B). In contrast, no growth was seen when the net charge at the C-terminal flanking region was changed to -3 upon replacing both Arg-33 and Arg-34 by glutamic acid residues (Tom20-R33E/R34E) (Fig. 2B). Is the growth of the cells correlated with the amounts of Tom20 variants in the mitochondria? Crude mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation from wild-type and transformed cells and the levels of Tom20 were determined by immunodecoration (Fig. 2C). Tom20-R9E that supports growth was present at wild-type level in the isolated mitochondria (Fig. 2C). In contrast, hardly any Tom20-R33E/R34E was detected in the mitochondria and most of the protein was found in the supernatant (Fig. 2C). The total level of Tom20-R33E/R34E was very low. A clear correlation between the level of growth and the amount of Tom20 in the mitochondria was also found with other strains. The Tom20 variant that could not support growth, Tom20-R9E/R33Q/R34Q was completely absent from the mitochondria. Tom20-D30Q/R33Q/R34Q, on the other hand, could support growth much better than Tom20-R33Q/R34Q and indeed higher amounts of the former variant were found in mitochondria (Fig. 2C). This correlation suggests that most likely the lack of function is due to a defect in proper targeting resulting in degradation of the protein, rather than defects in the function after proper sorting and insertion into mitochondria. Growth of a TOM20 deletion strain harboring the different Tom20 variants (including further variants with altered net charge) are summarized in Table I. From these data we conclude that a positive charge in both C- and N-terminal flanking regions is not an absolute requirement for targeting and membrane insertion. Remarkably, a Tom20 variant lacking any positively charged residues at both flanking regions promoted efficient growth of the yeast cells (Tom20-R9Q/D30Q/R33Q/R34Q, Table I). A major fraction of Tom20 variants with a neutral or even negative charge in one of the flanking regions was targeted to mitochondria as long as the opposite flanking region had positive charge. None of the variants with an overall negative charge at both flanking regions could support growth to a significant extent.Table ITom20 variants and their ability to support growth on YPGPlasmid transformed into Δtom20 strainCharges at N- and C-terminal flanking regionsaNine amino acid residues were taken into account at the N- and ten at the C-terminal flanking region.

Hydrophobicity and/or the length of the membrane-spanning segment could be important. To test this possibility we constructed hybrid proteins composed of various parts of the signal anchor domains of Cue1 and Tom20. Cue1 is a signal-anchored protein embedded in the membrane of the ER (23Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. Science. 1997; 278: 1806-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Its single TMD is shorter and more hydrophobic than that of Tom20 (Fig. 3A). When the entire signal-anchor domain of Cue1 (amino acid residues 1–33) was fused in front of the cytosolic domain of Tom20, rescue of growth was not observed (Fig. 3B, variant 1). Likewise, a construct in which only the membrane-spanning segment of the two proteins was exchanged leaving the flanking regions of Tom20 unaltered, did not support growth (Fig. 3B, variant 3). To exclude the possibility that the lack of rescue is due to the shorter length of the TMD of Cue1, this latter segment was introduced to replace the first 15 amino acid residues of the transmembrane segment of Tom20 (Fig. 3, A and B, variant 2). Although the resulting transmembrane segment had a similar length as the authentic Tom20 segment it did not support growth. Thus, moderate hydrophobicity rather than length seems to be crucial for mitochondrial targeting. This view is supported by the observation that exchange of four residues in the transmembrane domain of Tom20 by the hydrophobic residues, Ile or Leu, resulted in reduced growth (Fig. 3, A and B, variant 4). We further determined the location of the various Tom20 variants by subcellular fractionation. The vast majority of wild-type Tom20 and a Tom20 variant lacking charges at the flanking regions (Tom20–4Q(R9Q/D30Q/R33Q/R34Q)) was found in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 3C). In contrast, those variants containing the TMD of Cue1 were located mainly to the ER. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the TMD of Cue1 contains a yet unidentified dominant ER targeting signal, we propose the elevated hydrophobicity of the transmembrane domain to promote targeting of the protein to the ER. Is there specificity in the amino acid sequence of the TMD or is only modest average hydrophobicity important? To answer this question we generated two variants of Tom20 where the sequence of the TMD was scrambled (Fig. 3D). Although the average hydrophobicity of the TMD is retained in these variants they were able to rescue the growth phenotype of tom20-null strain only partially (Fig. 3D). Thus, the specific sequence of the span is also important. Since the signal anchor domains of other outer membrane proteins can successfully replace the signal of Tom20 (see below), we do not believe that the specific order of the amino acids is required for sequence-specific interactions with other proteins. Rather, the specific sequence of a native signal was probably optimized during evolution for the formation of a helical secondary structure required for targeting and insertion. As expected, the scrambled sequences cannot promote the formation of such a structure with a similar efficiency. OM45 Is a Signal-anchored Protein—Tom20 and Tom70 as subunits of the TOM complex itself could follow a special import pathway. Therefore, we wanted to extend our study to an outer membrane protein, which is unrelated to the TOM complex. OM45 was suggested to be a signal-anchored protein but experimental evidence for this assumption was not presented (9Yaffe M.P. Jensen R.E. Guido E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21091-21096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether the transmembrane segment of OM45 and its flanking regions are sufficient for mitochondrial targeting. A hybrid protein containing the first 32 amino acid residues of OM45 in front of GFP was transformed into yeast cells. The OM45-(1–32)-GFP protein co-localized with a mitochondrial-specific dye (Fig. 4A). Cells transformed with full-length OM45 fused to GFP exhibited a similar fluorescence pattern (not shown, see Ref. 24Cerveny K.L. McCaffery J.M. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, amino acid residues 1–32 of OM45 are sufficient to target a passenger protein to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Next, we verified that the signal-anchor domain is indeed necessary for import into mitochondria. Radiolabeled precursor of OM45 was imported in vitro into mitochondria and its insertion into the mitochondrial outer membrane was assessed by carbonate extraction followed by analyzing the extraction products on sucrose gradients (Fig. 4B). Full-length precursor of OM45 and the endogenous OM45 were found in the upper zone of the gradient, whereas soluble proteins like aconitase are in the lower part of the gradient. A precursor lacking most of the TMD due to initiation of translation at Met-21 fractionated at the bottom of the gradient (Fig. 4B). Thus, in a cell free import system OM45 can be targeted to and become anchored in the mitochondrial outer membrane in a process that requires its TMD. The Signal-Anchor Domains of OM45 and Tom70 Can Functionally Replace That of Tom20 —Does the signal-anchor domain of Tom20 have a specific role in the function of the protein? To address this question we investigated whether a signal-anchor domain of another outer membrane protein, like Tom70 or OM45, can functionally replace the one of Tom20. Chimeric proteins containing the signal-anchor domain of either OM45 (residues 1–32) or Tom70 (residues 1–41) fused to the cytosolic domain of Tom20 were constructed. Both proteins, OM45-(1–32)-Tom20(cyt) and Tom70-(1–41)-Tom20(cyt) could rescue the growth phenotype of tom20-null strain (Fig. 5A). Hence, targeting and anchoring of Tom20 cytosolic domain to the mitochondrial outer membrane can be mediated by signalanchor domains of other mitochondrial outer membrane proteins but not by a signal-anchor of a protein residing in the ER. We further investigated whether a hybrid protein composed of the signal-anchor domain of Tom20 in front of the passenger protein DHFR is able to assemble into the TOM complex. The radiolabeled hybrid protein was observed to associate with mitochondria upon incubation in vitro (Fig. 5B). However, only negligible amounts of the precursor were precipitated by antibodies against Tom40 and Tom22, whereas imported Tom20 precursor was efficiently immunoprecipitated with the TOM complex (Fig. 5B). We conclude that the signal-anchor domain of Tom20 plays a minor role, if any, in the assembly of this protein into the TOM complex. The Signal-Anchor Domain of Tom70 —Does the signal-anchor domain of Tom70 contain specific information for the function of the protein? A tom70-null strain was transformed with a plasmid encoding a chimeric protein composed of the signal-anchor domain of OM45 fused to the cytosolic domain of Tom70, OM45-(1–32)-Tom70(Δ1–35). Mitochondria were isolated from this and from the wild-type strain and the oligomeric structures and the folding states of Tom70 and its variant were analyzed. Both proteins migrated as dimers when analyzed by blue native gel electrophoresis (BNGE) (Fig. 6A). A purified cytosolic domain of Tom70 also migrated as a dimer under these conditions (not shown) or when analyzed in size exclusion chromatography (14Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.-U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). A previous study had suggested that dimerization of Tom70 is mediated by specific alanine residues in its membrane-spanning segment (25Millar D.G. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12229-12232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, our current results suggest that dimerization of Tom70 can be mediated by both the cytosolic domain and the transmembrane segment. To test whether the hybrid protein folds properly mitochondria were treated with low concentration of trypsin to cleave off the characteristic 60 kDa cytosolic domain of Tom70 (6Schlossmann J. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11893-11901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 60-kDa fragment was generated with wild-type and hybrid Tom70, although in the latter case with somewhat reduced efficiency (Fig. 6B). Hence, the signal-anchor domain of OM45 can direct the cytosolic domain of Tom70 to the mitochondrial outer membrane where homodimerization occurs and the protein folds into its native conformation. Is this hybrid protein functional in vivo? Whereas the deletion of Tom70 alone does not result in any significant growth phenotype, deletion of both import receptors, Tom20 and Tom70, was reported to lead to inviability (20Ramage L. Junne T. Hahne K. Lithgow T. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4115-4123Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Such a double-deletion mutant could be rescued by expression of functional Tom70 (Ref. 14Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.-U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar and Fig. 6C). Expression of OM45-(1–32)Tom70(Δ1–35) or Tom20-(1–36)-Tom70(Δ1–35) instead of wild-type Tom70 did also restore growth (Fig. 6C). When a nonfunctional signal-anchor domain (OM45–(1-32)R4E) or Tom20-(1–36)R9E/R33E/R34E) was fused to the cytosolic domain of Tom70, restoration of growth was not seen (Fig. 6C and not shown). Taken together, our results demonstrate that the signal-anchor domains from all three outer membrane proteins tested (Tom20, Tom70, and OM45) are functionally interchangeable. The Targeting Signal of OM45—The deletion of OM45 did not result in a significant growth phenotype under all conditions tested (Ref. 9Yaffe M.P. Jensen R.E. Guido E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21091-21096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2D. Rapaport and T. Waizenegger, unpublished observations. Nevertheless, the ability of the signalanchor domain of OM45 to target the cytosolic domain of Tom20 to the outer membrane enabled us to use the functional complementation assay described above to characterize the signal-anchor domain of OM45. Charge variants of the targeting signal of OM45 were constructed and fused in front of the cytosolic domain of Tom20. When Arg-4 was replaced by a serine residue targeting and function were not impaired (Fig. 7A). In contrast, hardly any rescue of growth was observed upon introducing a glutamate residue in this position (Fig. 7A). We verified that the observed growth phenotypes were correlated with the amount of the respective protein embedded in the mitochondrial outer membrane (Fig. 7B). The variant OM45-(1–32)R4E-Tom20(cyt) was associated with the mitochondria but only a small fraction was properly inserted in the outer membrane (Fig. 7B). This explains its poor ability to restore growth. The segment comprising residues 1–26 of OM45 was also sufficient for targeting the cytosolic domain of Tom20 to the outer membrane (Table II). Growth was observed even upon replacing the positively charged Lys-26 by either glutamine or glutamate residue (OM45-(1–26)K26Q-Tom20(cyt) and OM45-(1–26)K26E-Tom20(cyt), respectively) (Table II). A construct that contained a net neutral charge at both flanking regions, OM45-(1–26)R4S/K26E-Tom20(cyt), did support growth, whereas mutating both Arg-4 and Lys-26 to glutamate resulted in marginal growth (Table II). In conclusion, a net positive charge in the N- or C-terminal flanking region of the anchor segment of either OM45 or Tom20 is not crucial for targeting to mitochondria and membrane integration.Table IIOM45-Tom20 hybrid proteins and their ability to support growth on YPGPlasmid transformed to Δtom20 strainCharges at N- and C-terminal flanking regionsbFour amino acid residues were taken into account at the N- and ten at the C-terminal flanking region.

The dash represents the transmembrane domain Open table in a new tab Proteins of the outer membrane of mitochondria play important and essential roles in the life of these organelles, and thereby of cells. So far, however, little is known about their molecular structures, functions and topogenesis. We have investigated here a class of proteins located at the surface of mitochondria, which expose a hydrophilic domain to the cytosol and are anchored to the outer membrane by an N-terminal transmembrane segment. We show that N-terminal domains of diverse mitochondrial proteins are functionally interchangeable. Considering the lack of sequence similarity in these regions this observation is rather surprising. Our results imply that the specific assembly of Tom20 and Tom70 into the TOM complex is mediated mainly by the cytosolic domains of these receptor proteins. In agreement with this view the cytosolic domain of Tom20 was found to interact with the cytosolic domains of Tom70 and Tom22 (10Suzuki H. Maeda M. Mihara K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1895-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 26van Wilpe S. Ryan M.T. Hill K. Maarse A.C. Meisinger C. Brix J. Dekker P.J. Moczko M. Wagner R. Meijer M. Guiard B. Honlinger A. Pfanner N. Nature. 1999; 401: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The lack of interactions between the membrane-spanning domains of Tom20 and Tom70 and membrane-embedded elements of the TOM complex would also explain why Tom20 and Tom70 are only peripheral members of the TOM complex (27Dekker P.J.T. Ryan M.T. Brix J. Müller H. Hönlinger A. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6515-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 28Ahting U. Thun C. Hegerl R. Typke D. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Nussberger S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We propose that the main function of the N-terminal signal-anchor domains of Tom20 and Tom70 is not in their recruitment to the TOM complex but rather to keep these proteins in the plane of the outer membrane so that they can collect precursor proteins at the whole mitochondrial surface. As shown here, a Tom20 without its signal-anchor domain cannot function as a receptor. At the same time, the TMDs with their flanking sequences contain the signals for targeting to and insertion into the mitochondrial outer membrane. What are the structural elements of such signal-anchor sequences? We analyzed two characteristics: the charges of residues in the regions flanking the TMD, and the average hydrophobicity of the TMD itself. The C-terminal flanking regions of the TMDs have a net positive charge in all yeast mitochondrial proteins known to adopt the N-terminal anchor topology. In addition, at least two hydroxylated and one to three positively charged amino acids occur in the N-terminal flanking regions. We observed a net neutral charge of the C-terminal flanking regions to be tolerated; even a net negative charge resulted in correct targeting, though only with rather low efficiency. The hydroxylated residues in the N-terminal region could be removed without any effect. Similarly, replacing the positively charged residues in these segments by neutral ones did not affect targeting. Thus, positively charged residues in both flanking regions enhance targeting and membrane integration but are not absolutely required. Previous observations that import of Tom70 into isolated mitochondria did occur even when the positive charges in the N-terminal flanking region were removed would support this proposal (29McBride H.M. Millar D.G. Li J.M. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In mammalian systems a net positive charge at the C-terminal flanking region was reported to be critical for mitochondrial targeting (10Suzuki H. Maeda M. Mihara K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1895-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 11Kanaji S. Iwahashi J. Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the apparently different situation in yeast and rat is the different lipid composition of the outer membrane in these two organisms. Whereas phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) makes up only 28% of the total lipids in mitochondrial outer membranes of rat, outer membranes from yeast have a higher percentage of 36% PE (30De Kroon A.I.P.M. Dolis D. Mayer A. Lill R. De Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1325: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 31De Kroon A.I.P.M. Koorengevel M.C. Goerdayal S.S. Mulders P.C. Janssen M.J. De Kruijff B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Such “nonbilayer lipids” were proposed to create insertion sites for proteins (32van den Brink-van der Laan E. Dalbey R.E. Demel R.A. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9677-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The higher PE content in yeast may promote insertion of the transmembrane domain, even when not all structural parameters are optimal. Another possibility is that yet unknown protein(s) that decode(s) the targeting signal at the surface of mitochondria have a somewhat less stringent requirement for the presence of positive charges in yeast as compared with mammals. Moderate hydrophobicity of the TMD appears to be the key parameter for signal-anchor domain carrying preprotein to mitochondria. Introducing a more hydrophobic TMD without altering the flanking regions prevented correct targeting to and function in the mitochondrial outer membrane. Even mutating only four residues in the Tom20 TMD to more hydrophobic ones resulted in growth retardation. These results are in line with a previous report, which describes targeting of mammalian Tom20 to the ER/secretory pathway if its transmembrane domain was mutated to become more hydrophobic (11Kanaji S. Iwahashi J. Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The importance of hydrophobicity is emphasized by the finding that a negative charge at the N-terminal flanking region is much better tolerated in the context of the signal-anchor domain of Tom20 as compared with that of OM45. We propose that this difference is related to the higher hydrophobicity of the transmembrane domain of OM45 (Fig. 1). In the case of Tom20 the deviation from the optimal charge distribution is compensated by a favorable hydrophobicity (a relative low one). In contrast, the high hydrophobicity of the transmembrane domain of OM45 does not allow a further deviation in the direction of a more negative charge. Modest hydrophobicity however is not the only structural requirement. Since Tom20 variants with scrambled sequence of the TMD can only partially the function of the protein, it is apparent that the native sequence better supports the formation of a favored structural element, most probably an α-helix. In conclusion, we suggest that the signal for mitochondrial targeting and insertion in N-terminal anchor proteins is composed of two elements with a clear hierarchy. The most important criterion is moderate hydrophobicity of the transmembrane domain, while positively charged residues in the flanking regions cooperate with the transmembrane domain to improve targeting and anchoring in the outer membrane. Anchor domains that fulfill these structural requirements are functionally interchangeable. They play only a minor role in the specific function of these proteins, but have a decisive role in topogenic signaling. We thank P. Heckmeyer, T. Rückrich, and S.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5411) Google Scholar). In plants, cytosine methylation has been proven to be essential for inactivation of transposable elements (3Miura A. Yonebayashi S. Watanabe K. Toyama T. Shimada H. Kakutani T. Nature. 2001; 411: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Also, methylated cytosines are often seen in inactivated transgenes (4Wassenegger M. Plant Mol.

Methylation of cytosine residues in DNA is enzymatically catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases, which transfer a methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to the 5-position. In mammals, two types of DNA methyltransferase, which differ in DNA substrate preference, have been reported. Those belonging to the Dnmt1 group prefer cytosines in hemimethylated CpG sites, i.e. CpG with m5C in only one strand (1Yoder J.A. Walsh C.P. Bestor T.H. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 335-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar), and are considered to be associated with the DNA replication complex in vivo (6Chuang L.S.-H. Ian H.-I.

For example, in Arabidopsis, MET1, chromomethylase (CMT), and domains rearranged methyltransfease (DRM) are distinct (8Finnegan E.J. Kovac K.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 43: 189-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MET1 is homologous to mammalian Dnmt1 (9Finnegan E.J. Dennis E.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2383-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and its suppression results in a drastic reduction of global methylation in transgenic Arabidopsis (10Finnegan E.J.

The other two types are unique to plants; putative proteins belonging to the CMT group have a chromodomain in catalytic motifs and are reported to be responsible for maintenance of cytosine methylation at CpNpG sites in, for example, retrotransposons (where N is A, T, or C) (13Lindroth A.M. Cao X. Jackson J.P. Zilberman D. McCallum C.M. Henikoff S. Jacobsen S.E. Science. 2001; 292: 2077-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 14Tompa R. MaCallum C.M. Delrow J. Henikoff J.G. van Steensel B. Henikoff S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 65-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that the DRM type has catalytic motifs, thus resembling mammalian de novo enzymes such as Dnmt3 (15Cao X. Springer N.M. Muszynski M.G. Phillips R.L. Kaeppler S. Jacobsen S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4979-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), although they differ in possessing a characteristic rearrangement in catalytic motifs, between I-V and VI-X. A recent genetic analysis with mutant lines suggested that Arabidopsis DRMs might be responsible for the methylation of cytosines in CpNpG and asymmetric sequences of transgenes (16Cao X. Jacobsen S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1138-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Asymmetric cytosine methylation was also seen in epigenetically silenced loci, with DRMs further suggested to function in epigenetic gene silencing (15Cao X. Springer N.M. Muszynski M.G. Phillips R.L. Kaeppler S. Jacobsen S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4979-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 16Cao X. Jacobsen S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1138-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). However, no studies on biochemical properties of these proteins have been reported so far. In this article, we describe isolation of tobacco DRM. The enzyme expressed in insect cells could be shown to preferentially methylate cytosine residues in CpNpN and also CpNpG, providing concrete evidence for the predicted function of DRMs. Plant Materials—Tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi) were grown in a greenhouse under natural day length conditions. Tobacco BY2 cells (N. tabacum cv. Bright Yellow 2) were maintained in suspension culture using modified Linsmaier and Skoog medium (LS medium) (17Nagata T. Takabe I. Matsui C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 184: 161-165Crossref Scopus (258) Google Scholar) at 23 °C continuously in the dark. The synchronization of BY2 cells was performed as described (12Nakano Y. Steward N. Kusano T. Sano H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with modification. After culture in a modified LS medium containing 5 μg ml-1 aphidicolin (Wako, Tokyo) for 24 h, cells were collected and washed with 3% sucrose solution, transferred to fresh medium. and cultured further. They were then harvested by centrifugation and stained with 1% orcein to allow determination of the mitotic index. Isolation of NtDRM1 cDNA—Initially, a DNA fragment encoding NtDRM1 was obtained by differential display of a cDNA population derived from wounded tobacco leaves (18Hara K. Yagi M. Koizumi N. Kusano T. Sano H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A full-length 2.4-kb cDNA of NtDRM1 was isolated by colony hybridization of a tobacco (N. tabacum) cDNA library using the NtDRM1 fragment as a probe and sequenced for both strands using a Big Dye terminator sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Motif prediction was performed using the on-line data bases PROSITE (tw.expasy.org/prosite/) and ISREC motif scan (hits.isb-sib.ch/cgi-bin/PFSCAN). Phylogenetic analysis was accomplished with ClustalW (clustalw.genome.ad.jp/). Transformation of BY2 Cells and Histochemical Analysis—The NtDRM1 coding region (1824 bp) was fused in-frame via an engineered NcoI site to the N terminus of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) open reading frame. The construct was then cloned into the SmaI and EcoRI sites of pBI121 (19Bevan M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8711-8721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar) and transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 (20Hood E.E. Gelvin S.B. Melchers L.S. Hoekema A. Transgenic Res. 1993; 2: 208-218Crossref Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) by the heat-shock method. Following a 2-day co-cultivation of the individually transformed A. tumefaciens with 5 ml of 4-day-old cultured tobacco BY-2 cells in the dark, transformed calli were selected using 100 μg/ml kanamycin and 250 μg/ml calbenicyrin over a 4-week period (21An G. Plant Physiol. 1985; 79: 568-570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA staining was performed with an aliquot of MS medium containing 1 mg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). GFP fluorescence was observed using an AX70 fluorescence microscope equipped with UV- and B-excitation filters (Olympus, Tokyo) and standard fluorescein isothiocyanate filters. Digital images were captured with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (CoolSNAP-HQ, Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). Expression and Purification of a GST::NtDRM1 Fusion Protein—Full-length NtDRM1 was fused to the C terminus of a glutathione S-transferase (GST) and expressed in insect cells using the GATEWAY cloning system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amplification with a set of primers (forward, 5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTTTATGGACAACAATCTTTCTGGAGAAGAC-3′; reverse, 5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTACTAATGTTTATGTCTGGACATTATGGACTT-3′) was achieved, and the resulting fragment was subjected to a second PCR with another set of primers (forward, 5-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGC-3; reverse, 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGT-3′). The final fragment was cloned into the pDEST20 vector plasmid and transformed into Escherichia coli together with bacumid (genome of a baculovirus) to allow in vivo recombination, and resulting single plaques were picked up and further propagated. Sf9 cells (6 × 109), maintained in Grace's insect medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 500 μg/ml gentamycin, were infected with the recombinant baculovirus (500 μl) and incubated at 27 °C for 4 days. Cells from one dish were suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 25% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml aprotinin) and sonicated twice for 10 s. GST-fused NtDRM1 with 77 kDa was purified through a glutathione-Sepharose column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentrations were estimated by the Bradford method, and immunoblot analysis was performed as described (22Steward N. Kusano T. Sano H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3250-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). DNA Methyltransferase Assay—DNA methyltransferase activity was monitored by incorporation of the 3H-labeled methyl group of AdoMet into recipient DNA substrate. For the initial assay, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) (Sigma) was used as the substrate. For methylation of native DNA, samples from pGEX propagated in E. coli and Sf9 cells were used. For sequence specificity assays, the synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-ACGATCGTACGATCGTACGATCGT-3′ (for CpG), 5′-ACTGCAGTACTGCAGTACTGCAGT-3′ (for CpNpG, where N is A or T), and 5′-AGCATGCTAGCATGCTAGCATGCT-3′ (for CpNpN) were prepared. All these sequences are palindromic, which form duplexes. For hemimethylation analysis, synthetic 28-mer oligonucleotides containing five m5Cs and its complementary strand without m5C were independently prepared and annealed to form duplexes. The substrates for CpG were 5′-ATTCGATCGAATCGTATACGTACGTATT-3′ and 3′-TAAGCTAGCTTAGCATATGCATGCATAA-5′ (m5C is underlined), and those for CpNpG were 5′-ATTCAGTCAGATCTGATCAGTACTGATT-3′ and 3′-TAAGTCAGTCTAGACTAGTCATGACTAA-5′. The 100-μl reaction mixture contained 20 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.0), 5 mm EDTA, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml RNase A. 2 μm AdoMet (methyl-3H, specific activity 307.1 GBq/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and appropriate amounts of substrate DNA and enzyme preparation were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated period. To the reaction mixture was added 1 mg/ml of proteinase K (Invitrogen) in 500 μl of proteinase K-SDS buffer, containing 1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 125 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. After further incubation at 50 °C for 1 h, substrate DNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform treatment, precipitated with ethanol, and spotted onto DEAE paper, which was washed with 0.5 m sodium phosphate, dried, and assessed for radioactivity. Under these experimental conditions, the background level of 3H radioactivity was ∼50 cpm per assay, indicating the quenching to be suppressed to a minimum. Kinetic parameters were calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation with the Anemona program (23Hernandez A. Ruiz M.T. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 227-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Quantitative Analysis of m5C—Identification of m5C by HPLC was performed using substrate DNA isolated from Sf9 cells. A 200-μl reaction mixture, containing 100 μg of DNA, 2 mm AdoMet (Sigma), and the appropriate amounts of NtDRM1 in the methylation buffer as described above, was incubated at 37 °C for 16 h and then further with 110 ng of RNase A (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) at 37 °C for 2 h. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and digested with 2 units of nuclease P1 (Sigma) in 100-μl buffer containing 3 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.4) and 0.5 mm ZnSO4 at 37 °C for 20 h. The resultant nucleotides were dephosphorylated with 20 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Takara, Otsu, Japan) at 37 °C for 2 h. Samples were then fractionated by ultrafiltration (Ultrafree-MC PL-10 microcentrifuge tubes, Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the permeate was injected into a Supelcosil LC-18-S column (Supelco, Bellafonte, PA). Separation was performed with a 2.5-20% methanol gradient in the presence of 50 mm KH2PO4 (pH 4.3). DNA Methylation Mapping—Substrate DNA was prepared by PCR-amplifying a 962-bp fragment of pGEX-4T-1 (positions 4521-513, containing the position 1) then methylated in vitro in a reaction mixture containing 25 μg of DNA, 2 mm AdoMet (Sigma), and 93.75 μg of NtDRM1 in methylation buffer, as described above, at 37 °C for 16 h. After phenol extraction and precipitation with ethanol, DNA was subjected to bisulfite modification (24Raizis A.M. Schmitt F. Jost J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The method was developed to identify m5C in arbitrary sequences, based on the resistance of m5C to bisulfite, which changes C into U. After bisulfite treatment, the modified DNA can be amplified by PCR, cloned, and directly sequenced, the C and m5C in the initial sequence being replaced with T and C, respectively. Experimentally, modified DNA was subjected to first PCR using ExTaq™ enzyme (Takara) and specific forward, 5′-GTTGTGTAGTTTGAATGGTGAATGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAACCACCCAACATATTATACTTATCAAC-3′ primers. Both were designed for predicted sequences after modification, in which C was assumed to be converted into T in the former and G into A in the latter. The resulting product was subjected to subsequent second PCR with the same forward primer and another reverse primer, 5′-CACAAAACCCTTAATTTTCCAATAACC-3′ (G was replaced with A). Amplified 594-bp DNA samples were ligated to the pGEM-T easy vector™ (Promega, Madison, WI) and cloned in DH5α (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Sequences were determined with an ABI PRISM BigDye™ Terminator DNA sequencing kit and a 3100 Genetic Analyzer automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Fifteen clones were sequenced, and the average methylation at each site was calculated. DNA and RNA Isolation and Gel Blot Hybridization—Genomic DNA was extracted by the cetyl-trimethylammonium bromide method (25Murray M.G. Thompson W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 4321-4325Crossref PubMed Scopus (9347) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from indicated tissues or from BY2 cells by the acid guanidinium/phenol/chloroform method (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar), and hybridization analyses were performed as described (27Yoda H. Ogawa M. Yamaguchi Y. Koizumi N. Sano H. Mol. Genet. Genom. 2002; 267: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) with probes synthesized with a pair of primers specific for each gene. Identification of NtDRM1—During screening for genes whose transcripts accumulate in the early stage after wounding of tobacco leaves by the modified differential display, a particular fragment of 1.6 kb was identified. Although the clone was found later not necessarily to be specific to the wound response by Northern hybridization, it was further characterized because homology searches indicated resemblance to genes for DNA methyltransferases. Subsequent screening of a tobacco cDNA library yielded a full length of 2,540-bp cDNA, encoding a protein of 608 amino acids. Sequence analysis showed it to contain at least six highly conserved motifs found in DNA methyltransferases, but their order was unusual. In contrast to the majority of eukaryotic DNA methyltransferases, having conserved motifs that are arranged in the order of I-IV-VIII-X in the C terminus, the present putative protein was found to possess motifs in the rearranged order of VI-VIII-IX-X-I-IV (Fig. 1A). A homology search indicated high homology to DRMs from Arabidopsis (DRM1 and DRM2) and maize (Zmet3) (15Cao X. Springer N.M. Muszynski M.G. Phillips R.L. Kaeppler S. Jacobsen S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4979-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Consequently, we concluded that the isolated gene encodes a DRM, and we designated it as NtDRM1 ( N. tabacum domains rearranged methyltransferase 1). In the N-terminal region, two domains (amino acid positions 61-97 and 166-204) were found that resembled the ubiquitin association (UBA) domains of human p62 and yeast RAD23 (Fig. 1A). UBA domains, considered to function in protein-protein interactions, have also been identified in DRMs of Arabidopsis and maize (15Cao X. Springer N.M. Muszynski M.G. Phillips R.L. Kaeppler S. Jacobsen S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4979-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A nuclear localization signal is present at amino acid positions 234-237 (Fig. 1A). A phylogenetic tree generated with the conserved catalytic motifs I-IV indicated that DRMs are more closely related to the de novo methyltransferases from mammals (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) than to other plant DNA methyltransferases (Fig. 1B). A similar tree was also obtained when motifs VI-X were aligned (data not shown). Subcellular Localization—To identify the cellular localization, a reporter gene encoding GFP was selected, and a plasmid expressing the NtDRM1-GFP fusion protein under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter was constructed. As the control, a plasmid expressing only GFP was used. Each plasmid was introduced into onion epidermis cells by biolistic bombardment, and interference contrast images for whole cell structures (Fig. 2, A and C) and GFP fluorescence for localization of GFP proteins (Fig. 2, B and D) were examined. Although CaMV 35S::GFP control construct showed GFP signals in both cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 2B), with CaMV 35S::NtDRM1-GFP they were predominantly in the nucleus (Fig. 2D). To confirm the nuclear localization of NtDRM1 in planta, tobacco BY-2 cells were stably transformed with the same plasmids, and GFP fluorescence was detected in living cells (Fig. 2, E-H). As in onion cells, fluorescence of NtDRM1-GFP was observed only in the nucleus (Fig. 2, F and H). This pattern was identical with that of DAPI, which stains the nucleus (Fig. 2G). A nuclear localization of NtDRM1 was ubiquitously observed in transformed cells (Fig. 2, E and F). It is evident from these results that NtDRM1 is exclusively localized in nuclei. Purification and Enzymatic Analysis—NtDRM1 cDNA was fused in-frame to the GST gene and expressed using the baculovirus-mediated insect cell (Sf9) expression system, which lacks endogenous DNA methyltransferase activity. After three cycles of propagation of infected Sf9 cells, crude proteins were recovered and further purified through a glutathione-Sepharose column. SDS-PAGE indicated the product to be almost homogeneous (Fig. 3A), and this was confirmed to be the recombinant protein by immunoblot staining with anti-GST antibodies (Fig. 3A). By using the crude protein preparation, methylation activity was preliminarily assayed by measuring 3H-labeled methyl group transfer from AdoMet into the synthetic oligonucleotide, poly(dI-dC)-poly (dI-dC). As positive and negative controls, mammalian Dnmt3a, a de novo DNA methyltransferase, and bacterial β-glucuronidase (GUS), respectively, were similarly expressed and subjected to the same assay. The amounts of enzyme protein in the crude samples were estimated by densitometric quantitation of immunostaining after gel electrophoresis, and activity was normalized. Methyl group incorporation was clear in the reaction mixture containing GST-NtDRM1 or GST-Dnmt3a proteins, whereas it was undetectable with the GST-GUS preparation (Fig. 3B). The activity of NtDRM1 was 10-fold higher than that of Dnmt3a, suggesting an identity as a de novo DNA methyltransferase. The optimal pH for the reaction was found to be 7.0 (data not shown). To obtain kinetic information, the activity was further assayed using purified GST-NtDRM1 and varying concentrations of poly(dG-dC)-poly(dG-dC) and also poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), because the former frequently forms multistranded structures and even nonspecific aggregation, whereas the latter does not (Fig. 3C). Methylation activity increased in a substrate-dependent manner and poly(dI-dC) proved to be a better substrate for the enzyme than poly(dG-dC), probably reflecting the structural features. The apparent K m values for poly(dI-dC) and poly(dG-dC) were 2.58 ± 0.03 and 6.36 ± 0.53 μm (in methylatable cytosine mononucleotides), respectively, and the V max values were calculated to be 718.9 ± 10.5 and 312.0 ± 58.9 fmol/min/nmol protein, respectively (Fig. 3C). The ratio of methyl incorporation to the substrate cytosines in poly(dI-dC) was estimated to be around 1/105 under the experimental conditions with low concentrations of enzyme and AdoMet and a reaction time of only 30 min. The results indicate de novo cytosine methylation by NtDRM1. Sequence Specificity—In order to determine the sequence specificity for NtDRM1-mediated methylation, three synthetic oligonucleotides, with different sequences but the same base composition, were prepared. Each palindromic 24-mer contained 6 sites for CpG, CpNpG, or CpNpN, respectively, where N is A or T. The highest methylation was seen with the CpNpN substrate, 3H incorporation increasing almost linearly with incubation period up to 1.5 h, whereas methyl transfer efficiency was lower with CpNpG than CpNpN and almost null with the CpG substrate (data not shown). The effect of substrate concentration on enzymatic activity was then examined with a fixed concentration of the enzyme and varying concentrations of DNA (Fig. 4A). The best substrate was CpNpN, with a substrate-dependent hyperbolic increase in the reaction velocity (Fig. 4A). The apparent K m and V max values were 45.9 ± 3.04 nm and 224.4 ± 4.12 fmol/min/nmol protein (based on the methylatable cytosine mononucleotides), respectively. The molar ratio of methyl group incorporated to the substrate was ∼1/103. The transfer rate of the methyl group into CpNpG was 2/3 of that into CpNpN and almost zero into CpG (Fig. 4A). The apparent K m and V max values were 78.3 ± 5.26 nm and 192.2 ± 4.62 fmol/min/nmol protein (based on the methylatable cytosine mononucleotides), respectively. These kinetic experiments suggested NtDRM1 to preferentially methylate cytosines in non-CpG sequences. Effects of hemimethylation were then analyzed. A synthetic 28-mer oligonucleotide containing either CpG or CpNpG was prepared, in which all cytosines were substituted with m5C. A non-methylated complementary strand was also generated and annealed to form a double-stranded substrate. Methyl transfer activity was then assayed with a fixed concentration of the enzyme and varying concentrations of the substrate (Fig. 4B). These kinetic analyses showed the enzyme to be active on the hemimethylated CpNpG at a lower velocity than on the unmethylated CpNpG substrate. By taking account of the fact that the number of available cytosines in the former is only half that in the latter, the K m and V max values were calculated to be 21.2 ± 2.37 nm (based on the methylatable cytosine mononucleotides) and 90.9 ± 10.8 fmol/min/nmol protein, respectively, for the hemimethylated substrate. The K m and V max values for the unmethylated substrate were 10.9 ± 1.50 nm (based on the methylatable cytosine mononucleotides) and 136.1 ± 13.4 fmol/min/nmol protein, respectively. These values indicate that the specificity of the enzyme is lower toward the hemimethylated CpNpG than toward the unmethylated CpNpG. The methylation patterns of both hemimethylated and unmethylated CpG substrates were similar to but lower than that of CpNpG, showing apparent K m values of 37.0 ± 8.54 and 27.3 ± 3.34 nm, respectively (Fig. 4B). The results suggested that the enzyme does not recognize the hemimethylated state of CpG and CpNpG and therefore confirmed its non-maintenance, de novo properties. Direct Methylation Mapping—The sequence specificity was directly determined by methylation mapping. Native DNA was intensively methylated in vitro with excess AdoMet and the enzyme, modified by the bisulfite method, amplified with PCR, cloned, and directly sequenced. The conversion efficiency of cytosine (C) into uracil (U) was directly estimated by aligning sequences and found to be nearly complete as all cytosines in the untreated sequence were converted into thymine (T) (Fig. 5A). The methylation frequencies were estimated for 15 clones, assigned to each cytosine, and expressed as percentages (Fig. 5B). The enzyme showed the highest methylation of cytosines in CpNpN followed by CpNpG and least in CpG. The percentages of methylated sites in the total in 15 clones were ∼75% for CpNpN and 60% for CpNpG, in sharp contrast with the 10% for CpG"

In situations of peripheral fat and cholesterol accumulation, such as obesity, these pathways may be overloaded, contributing to increased cholesterol deposition. Leptin has an important role in obesity, suppressing food intake and increasing energy expenditure. This hormone, which is absent in genetically obese ob/ob mice, is also thought to be involved in the coordination of lipid excretion pathways, although available data are somewhat inconsistent. We therefore studied the expression of the hepatic HDL receptor, scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), and the LDL receptor as well as the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1), in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice and their wild-type controls. In ob/ob mice, protein levels of both LDL receptor and SR-BI were reduced, whereas LDL receptor mRNA levels were increased and those of SR-BI were reduced, regardless of challenge with a 2% cholesterol diet. In ob/ob mice, the enzymatic activity and mRNA for Cyp7a1 were reduced, and the increase in response to dietary cholesterol was blunted. Upon short-term (2 days) treatment with leptin, a dose-dependent increase was seen in the SR-BI protein and mRNA, whereas the Cyp7a1 protein and mRNA were reduced. Our findings indicate that leptin is an important regulator of hepatic SR-BI expression and, thus, HDL cholesterol levels, whereas it does not stimulate Cyp7a1 and bile acid synthesis.

Our findings indicate that leptin is an important regulator of hepatic SR-BI expression and, thus, HDL cholesterol levels, whereas it does not stimulate Cyp7a1 and bile acid synthesis. Leptin is a circulating cytokine-like protein secreted mainly from adipose tissue. It acts to reduce food intake and increase energy expenditure by binding to its receptor in hypothalamic nuclei in the brain (1Friedman J.M. Nutr.

The increased level of plasma cholesterol in this mouse model is mainly attributed to higher plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) 1The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein; Cyp7a1, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase; SR-BI, scavenger receptor class B type I; LDL, low density lipoprotein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; C4, 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one.1The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein; Cyp7a1, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase; SR-BI, scavenger receptor class B type I; LDL, low density lipoprotein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; C4, 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one. cholesterol (4Nishina P.M.

Detailed metabolic studies have shown that ob/ob mice have defective HDL plasma clearance and disturbances in the intracellular distribution of cholesterol and its processing in the hepatocyte (5Silver D.L.

Invest. 2000; 105: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These abnormalities in HDL metabolism are normalized upon treatment with leptin. An increase in plasma apoA-I was found concomitant with a reduced hepatic apoA-I mRNA, further supporting the concept of a reduced hepatic metabolism of HDL in leptin deficiency. A major pathway for the excretion of body cholesterol is through the hepatic conversion of this sterol into bile acids, which is controlled by the activity of the microsomal enzyme cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1). Abnormalities of hepatic cholesterol metabolism in ob/ob mice have been reported (7Hyogo H. Roy S. Paigen B. Cohen D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34117-34124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), but the results are not consistent. Thus, increased Cyp7a1 mRNA levels were reported after 2 days of leptin treatment using transcriptional profiling (8Liang C.P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49066-49076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), whereas treatment for 2 weeks did not alter Cyp7a1 enzyme activity or bile acid synthesis (7Hyogo H. Roy S. Paigen B. Cohen D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34117-34124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The leptin deficiency in ob/ob mice promotes overeating, leading to weight gain which can be counteracted by prolonged leptin substitution (9Campfield L.A. Smith F.J. Guisez Y. Devos R. Burn P. Science. 1995; 269: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3063) Google Scholar, 10Halaas J.L. Gajiwala K.S. Maffei M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Rabinowitz D. Lallone R.L. Burley S.K. Friedman J.M.

Science. 1995; 269: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar). Prolonged leptin treatment of ob/ob mice may therefore reflect the effects of weight reduction and the consequences thereof, such as e.g. increased insulin sensitivity and reduced hepatic fat accumulation. The present study was undertaken to investigate hepatic cholesterol metabolism in ob/ob mice. We evaluated the effects on cholesterol and bile acid metabolism following challenge with a diet rich in cholesterol, and we assessed the responsiveness to short term leptin treatment at increasing doses. We have found that the hepatic HDL receptor, scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), and the LDL receptor are suppressed in ob/ob mice. The activity and mRNA for Cyp7a1 were reduced and showed an attenuated response to cholesterol feeding. With leptin treatment, the SR-BI protein and mRNA increased dose-dependently, whereas the Cyp7a1 protein and mRNA were reduced. Animals—C57BL/6J-ob/ob male mice and littermate controls were purchased from Taconic, Ry, Denmark. The animals were allowed to adapt to the animal housing for approximately 2 weeks and fed a standard mouse chow (R36, Lactamin, Kimstad, Sweden). All experiments were started when animals were 10 weeks old. The lights were on between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. The experiments were approved by the regional animal care and use committee. Treatments—For cholesterol feeding experiments, ob/ob and their wild-type controls were given either standard mouse chow or standard mouse chow supplemented with 2% cholesterol plus 10% oil (w/w) for 7 days. Each of the four groups consisted of four animals. At 9 a.m. the animals were anesthetized by ether inhalation, and blood was collected by cardiac puncture, after which they were killed by cervical dislocation. Livers were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For the leptin treatment experiments, leptin (Peprotech, London, UK) was dissolved in sodium citrate buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Leptin was administrated intraperitoneally in a volume of 200 μl at 6 p.m. for 2 days at the indicated doses. Controls received sodium citrate buffer. The experiment was ended on the third day by sacrificing the animals at 10 a.m., 16 h after the last injection. Each group in the leptin treatment experiment consisted of five ob/ob mice, except the control group, which consisted of six ob/ob mice. Plasma Lipids and Lipoproteins—Blood was centrifuged, and the plasma was analyzed for total cholesterol and triglycerides using the IL Test™ cholesterol 181618-10 and triglyceride 181610-60 kits (IL Scandinavia, Gothenburg, Sweden) on the Monark 2000 system (IL Scandinavia, Gothenburg, Sweden). Lipoprotein cholesterol profiles were obtained by separation of 10 μl of plasma using a micro fast protein liquid chromatography system for the generation of lipoprotein profiles as described elsewhere (12Gullberg H. Rudling M. Forrest D. Angelin B. Vennstrom B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma Leptin and Insulin—Plasma leptin levels were determined by a mouse leptin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems, Oxon, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasma insulin levels were analyzed using a rodent insulin RIA kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Linco, St. Charles, MI). Plasma 7α-Hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one Assay—As an indirect measurement of cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase activity, the plasma levels of 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) were analyzed from pooled plasma samples by high pressure liquid chromatography as described elsewhere (13Galman C. Arvidsson I. Angelin B. Rudling M. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 859-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Liver Preparations—Pooled livers (0.5 g) were homogenized in 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm leupeptin. Samples were sonicated for 15 s and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged in an Airfuge® (Beckman Coulter AB, Bromma, Sweden) for 7 min, aliquoted, and stored at –80 °C until further analysis. Protein concentrations were determined with Lowry DC kit (Bio-Rad). All work was performed on ice. Protein Blot Analysis—LDL receptor expression was assayed using liver membrane proteins that were electrophoresed under non-reducing conditions on 6% SDS-PAGE (14Rudling M. Norstedt G. Olivecrona H. Reihner E. Gustafsson J.A. Angelin B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6983-6987Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with 125I-labeled rabbit β-VLDL. The LDL receptor bands (≈120 kDa) were analyzed and quantified using a Fuji BAS 1800 analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co.) and Image Gauge software (Science Lab, 98, version 3.12, Fuji Photo Film Co.). SR-BI was assayed by immunoblot using liver membrane proteins and a rodent polyclonal antibody (Novus Biologicals Inc., Littleton, CO), as described previously (15Galman C. Angelin B. Rudling M. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1809-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The Cyp7a1 antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with the peptide NH2-KLH-Cys-Tyr-Lys-Leu-Lys-His-COOH, as used previously (16Brassil P.J. Edwards R.J. Davies D.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), corresponding to the last five amino acids in the mouse and rat Cyp7a1 proteins. The peptide was coupled to an affinity column to purify Cyp7a1 antibodies from rabbit serum. A Cyp7a1 Western blot was performed on hepatic microsomal proteins prepared as described previously (17Einarsson K. Angelin B. Ewerth S. Nilsell K. Bjorkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 82-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 25 μg of microsomal protein was electrophoresed on a 10% Criterion Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad) and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature in blocking solution (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% Tween, and 5% fat-free dry milk powder) and thereafter probed with the Cyp7a1 antibody (2 μg/ml) in blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, the membrane was incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit antibody (The Binding Site Ltd., Birmingham, UK) in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.2% Tween for 1 h at room temperature followed by washing in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.2% Tween. Supersignal (Pierce) was used to develop the membrane. Enzymatic Activities—Cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase activity was assayed in hepatic microsomal membranes as described previously (17Einarsson K. Angelin B. Ewerth S. Nilsell K. Bjorkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 82-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from snap frozen livers with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was DNase-treated with RQ1 DNase (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, 40 μg of total RNA was incubated with RQ1 DNase for 20 min at 37 °C; the enzyme was then inactivated at 70 °C for 15 min, and, after the addition of stop solution (Promega, Madison, WI), at 25 °C for 10 min. For cDNA synthesis, 4 μg of DNase treated total RNA was used. cDNA synthesis was carried out with Superscript II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, employing 200-ng random hexamers (Promega) per 20-μl cDNA reaction. Quantitative real time PCR was performed with the Taq-Man™ assay on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) following the guidelines in the user bulletin 2 (Applied Biosystems) on the “comparative Ct method.” An 18 S rRNA TaqMan™ assay reagent (Applied Biosystems) was used as endogenous control. The TaqMan™ primers and probes used were as follows: Cyp7a_FWD primer, 5′-CCATGATGCAAAACCTCCAAT-3′; Cyp7a_REV primer, 5′-ACCCAGACAGCGCTCTTTGA-3′; Cyp7a_TaqMan probe, 5′-TGTCATGAGACCTCCGGGCCTTCCTA-3′; SR-BI_FWD primer, 5′-GGGAGCGTGGACCCTATGT-3′; SR-BI_REV primer, 5′-ACACGGTGTCGTTGTCATTGA-3′; SR-BI_TaqMan probe, 5′-CAGGGAGTTCAGACAAAAGGTCAACATCACC-3′; LDL-R_FWD primer, 5′-CAAGGCTGTGGGCTCCATA-3′; LDL-R_REV primer, 5′-CGGTCCAGGGTCATCTTC-3′; and LDL-R_TaqMan probe, 5′-CTATCTGCTCTTCACCAACCGCC-3′. Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. The statistical significances of differences were evaluated using Student's t test. Plasma Lipids and Lipoprotein Profiles of Cholesterol-challenged ob/ob Mice— Table I displays plasma total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations together with body weights at the end of the experiment when ob/ob mice and controls were fed either a normal diet or 2% cholesterol for 7 days. As expected (4Nishina P.M. Lowe S. Wang J. Paigen B. Metabolism. 1994; 43: 549-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Silver D.L. Jiang X.C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4140-4146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the ob/ob mice were markedly hypercholesterolemic, which was due to increased LDL and HDL levels (Fig. 1A).Table IEffect of cholesterol feeding on total cholesterol and triglycerides in plasma of ob/ob mice compared to their controlsGroupBody weightCholesterolTriglyceridesgmmmmControls28 ± 0.82.8 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.1Controls + 2% cholesterol29 ± 0.72.4 ± 0.40.7 ± 0.1ob/ob45 ± 1.65.0 ± 0.4aSignificantly different from control, p < 0.01.1.1 ± 0.1ob/ob + 2% cholesterol45 ± 1.26.6 ± 0.2aSignificantly different from control, p < 0.01.1.1 ± 0.1a Significantly different from control, p < 0.01. Open table in a new tab As expected (12Gullberg H. Rudling M. Forrest D. Angelin B. Vennstrom B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cholesterol feeding to control mice increased VLDL and intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol but reduced HDL cholesterol. However, when ob/ob mice were fed the high-cholesterol diet they responded with a general elevation of cholesterol in all fractions (Fig. 1A). Decreased Expression of Hepatic LDL Receptors and SR-BI in ob/ob Mice—Because the increased LDL and HDL cholesterol seen in ob/ob mice could be due, at least in part, to a reduced expression of the hepatic receptors for LDL and HDL (18Krieger M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 523-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 19Trigatti B. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 20Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4348) Google Scholar), we next examined the expression of the LDL receptor in the liver by ligand blot assay with 125I-labeled rabbit β-VLDL on liver membranes from ob/ob and control mice (Fig. 1B). The LDL receptor expression was clearly reduced in both groups of ob/ob mice as compared with controls (Fig. 1B). In both controls and ob/ob mice, the expression of LDL receptors tended to increase in response to cholesterol feeding. Analysis of the mRNA expression of the LDL receptor with quantitative real time PCR revealed that the transcripts were more abundant in the ob/ob mice (p < 0.01), although both groups responded with a reduction when fed cholesterol (Fig. 1C). The expression of the hepatic HDL receptor, SR-BI, was thereafter analyzed by Western blot of liver membranes (Fig. 1D). There was a marked reduction of the SR-BI protein in the livers of ob/ob mice compared with the control mice, and cholesterol feeding did not alter this (Fig. 1, D and E). Also, the hepatic mRNA levels of SR-BI were reduced in ob/ob mice (p < 0.01), both on the normal and the cholesterol-enriched diet (Fig. 1E). Reduced Cyp7a1 Response to Cholesterol Challenge in ob/ob Mice—Because the formation of bile acids from hepatic cholesterol greatly influences cholesterol metabolism, we examined the rate-limiting enzyme in the bile acid synthesis pathway, Cyp7a1. Fig. 2 shows the enzyme activities for control and ob/ob mice on normal and 2% cholesterol diet, respectively. A normal Cyp7a1 response could be found in the control animals, wherein the activity increased by 3-fold following dietary cholesterol. Notably, in the ob/ob livers this response of Cyp7a1 to cholesterol was weaker (Fig. 2). Both ob/ob groups also displayed markedly lower activities than their respective control group (p < 0.05). This pattern was indeed similar when the mRNA levels of Cyp7a1 were measured, suggesting that this alteration in the ob/ob mice is at the transcriptional level. Short Term Treatment with Leptin of ob/ob Mice—We then wanted to investigate the metabolic effects of leptin treatment in the absence of leptin-induced weight changes of the animals. For this purpose, we set up a dose-response experiment in which ob/ob animals received one injection per day for 2 days, with doses ranging from 0.25 to 7.2 μg per gram of body weight per injection. During the course of the experiment, animal body weights did not differ significantly between the vehicle-treated and the leptin-treated groups. Plasma total cholesterol or triglycerides were not affected by leptin treatment, which was verified with fast protein liquid chromatography analysis in which no change was found in any of the lipoprotein fractions (not shown). The plasma levels of leptin in the treated animals increased with increasing doses of recombinant leptin administered (Fig. 3A). To monitor the biological activity of the injected leptin, we then analyzed plasma insulin levels, because previous studies have shown that leptin rapidly increases the peripheral insulin sensitivity in ob/ob mice, thereby leading to lowered plasma insulin levels (1Friedman J.M. Nutr. Rev. 2002; 60: S1-S14Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 9Campfield L.A. Smith F.J. Guisez Y. Devos R. Burn P. Science. 1995; 269: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3063) Google Scholar, 10Halaas J.L. Gajiwala K.S. Maffei M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Rabinowitz D. Lallone R.L. Burley S.K. Friedman J.M.

Science. 1995; 269: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar). It was found that plasma insulin levels decreased with increasing leptin dosage (Fig. 3A). However, at higher plasma levels of leptin, there were no effects on plasma insulin levels. Short Term Treatment with Leptin Enhances Hepatic Expression of SR-BI but Not Cyp7a1— Fig. 3B displays a representative Western blot of SR-BI on liver membranes from the ob/ob mice injected with increasing amounts of leptin. The hepatic SR-BI protein expression pattern correlated strikingly well to the plasma insulin levels (Fig. 3, A and B). Quantitative real time PCR analysis confirmed that the mRNA levels of liver SR-BI were also changed to a similar extent as the SR-BI protein levels (Fig. 3, B and C). Hence, short-term treatment with leptin up-regulates the hepatic SR-BI expression in ob/ob mice under non-weight-reducing conditions. From the cholesterol feeding experiments, it was evident that ob/ob mice have a lower Cyp7a1 activity, presumably due to a reduced transcription of the cyp7a1 gene. Because leptin treatment has been reported to increase the Cyp7a1 mRNA levels in ob/ob mice (8Liang C.P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49066-49076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we characterized the effects of leptin on bile acid synthesis in this experiment. First, we analyzed the plasma levels of C4, which is a sensitive marker of hepatic Cyp7a1 activity (13Galman C. Arvidsson I. Angelin B. Rudling M. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 859-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we could not observe any increased C4 levels, but rather a reduced concentration in all groups treated with leptin (Fig. 4A). A similar pattern was observed when the hepatic microsomal Cyp7a1 protein was assayed by Western blot (Fig. 4B). The highest level of Cyp7a1 protein expression was observed in the vehicle-treated ob/ob mice. Quantitative real time PCR analysis of hepatic mRNA from these ob/ob animals showed a clear reduction (p < 0.05 or better) of the mRNA levels of Cyp7a1 (Fig. 4C). Thus, it is evident that leptin treatment does not induce but instead reduces Cyp7a1 when administered to ob/ob mice in a short-term, non-weight-modifying regimen. The regulation of cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism in animal models of obesity is complex. The contribution of abnormalities occurring in response to insulin resistance, fat accumulation in the liver, and increased food intake through interaction with the nuclear receptors controlling genes responsible for lipogenesis and lipolysis make the interpretation of studies in obesity models difficult. The leptin-deficient ob/ob mouse is a suitable model for characterizing the influence of leptin. The present work describes abnormalities in hepatic cholesterol metabolism in ob/ob mice, some of which are reversed by leptin. The ob/ob mice displayed increased plasma cholesterol as the result mainly of an increase in HDL-size particles but also in larger LDL-like particles. Compared with controls, the ob/ob mice had a reduced expression of hepatic LDL receptors. Similar findings have been seen in Zucker rats (21Liao W. Angelin B. Rudling M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3276-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and db/db mice, 2W. Liao, T. Lundåsen, B. Angelin, and M. Rudling, unpublished results. which display abnormal leptin receptor function (22Chua Jr., S.C. Chung W.K. Wu-Peng X.S. Zhang Y. Liu S.M. Tartaglia L. Leibel R.L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30028-30032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the induction of LDL receptor observed in rodents following dietary cholesterol challenge (26Roach P.D. Balasubramaniam S. Hirata F. Abbey M. Szanto A. Simons L.A. Nestel P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1170: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 27Rudling M. Angelin B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8851-8855Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was less pronounced in ob/ob mice, whereas mRNA levels for the LDL receptor were higher in ob/ob mice and reduced by cholesterol challenge to a similar degree as that found in wild-type controls. The amount of the transcription factor called steroid regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) has been shown to be increased in ob/ob mice compared with wild type controls, whereas that of SREBP-2 is not changed (25Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30028-30032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Our finding of a moderate increase in LDL receptor mRNA levels is consistent with the report of Shimomura et al. (25Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30028-30032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) and may indicate a discrepancy between mRNA levels and protein expression for the LDL receptor, suggestive of posttranscriptional regulation of the LDL receptor (28Rudling M. Angelin B. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2796-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Sharkey M.F. Miyanohara A. Elam R.L. Friedmann T. Witztum J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 2167-2178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both by Western blot analysis and quantitative real time PCR analysis of hepatic SR-BI expression we found a clear decrease in ob/ob mice compared with wild-type animals. This finding is in line with the observed increase in plasma HDL cholesterol and is also in concert with the results reported by Silver et al. (6Silver D.L. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) describing decreased recycling, degradation, and selective lipid uptake from HDL particles in ob/ob hepatocytes. In a previous publication (5Silver D.L. Jiang X.C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4140-4146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), these authors were not able to demonstrate any difference in hepatic SR-BI expression between ob/ob and wild-type livers using Western and Northern blot analysis. We have no explanation for this discrepancy but have confirmed our results in repeated experiments. Also, in db/db mice we have found that the hepatic expression of SR-BI is reduced. 3T. Lundåsen, W. Liao, B. Angelin, and M. Rudling, unpublished results. After 2 days of leptin treatment there was a very clear dose-dependent increase in hepatic SR-BI expression, both measured as protein and as mRNA. The decrease in plasma insulin, indicating improvement of insulin sensitivity, paralleled the increase in SR-BI. This experiment further strengthens the concept that SR-BI is indeed sensitive to leptin deficiency. Although we cannot exclude that there is direct stimulation by insulin, we would interpret the data as further support for the concept that SR-BI down-regulation is an important explanatory mechanism for the increased HDL cholesterol in ob/ob mice. It is worth mentioning that the changes in SR-BI expression were observed at an earlier stage than when the changes in HDL cholesterol could be observed. Thus, in an additional experiment (not shown) wherein a new set of five ob/ob mice were leptin-treated (1.2 μg per gram of body weight per day) for 8 days, a 30% reduction of total plasma cholesterol was observed (from 4.4 ± 0.3 to 3.0 ± 0.2 mm, p < 0.01), which is in line with the results of Silver et al. (5Silver D.L. Jiang X.C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4140-4146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cyp7a1 enzyme activity and mRNA were reduced in ob/ob mice, and there was a blunted Cyp7a1 response to dietary cholesterol. Surprisingly, we found that Cyp7a1 was reduced in response to leptin treatment in ob/ob mice by using three different methods of assay, i.e. Cyp7a1 protein, mRNA, and plasma C4. These experiments were performed at a stage where when there was no difference in body weight between the treated and untreated animals, so the degree of obesity was not different. By using suppression-subtractive hybridization in combination with microarray analysis followed by Northern blot, Liang and Tall have reported an increase in Cyp7a1 mRNA after 2 days of leptin treatment of ob/ob mice (8Liang C.P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49066-49076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in line with our results, Cyp7a1 activity and fecal bile acid excretion were not stimulated by leptin treatment for 14 days, when partial weight reduction was present. Thus, it appears unlikely that leptin is a direct regulator of Cyp7a1. Increased insulin sensitivity induced by leptin could be an explanation to our finding, because insulin has been shown to down-regulate Cyp7a1 (30Wang D.P. Stroup D. Marrapodi M. Crestani M. Galli G. Chiang J.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1831-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Twisk J. Hoekman M.F. Lehmann E.M. Meijer P. Mager W.H. Princen H.M. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 501-510PubMed Google Scholar). The hormonal regulation of Cyp7a1 in vivo appears to be complex, and further studies on the influence of leptin on bile acid metabolism are warranted."

In the present study, we examined the possible functional relationship between the parkin and α-synuclein genes in a conditionally immortalized embryonic hippocampal cell (H19-7) line. Whereas transient transfection of α-synuclein into neuronal H19-7 cells caused the formation of its intracytoplasmic inclusions and a significant cell death, the combined overexpression of parkin restored the α-synuclein-induced decrease in cell viability to control levels. In addition, the overexpression of parkin was found to generate selective cleavage of α-synuclein. Furthermore, the cytoprotective effect of parkin on α-synuclein-induced cell death was not inhibited in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor. Interestingly, the overexpression of parkin induced the activation of an intracellular cysteine protease, calpain, but not caspase, and the cytoprotective effect of parkin on α-synuclein cytotoxicity was significantly inhibited by the presence of calpain-specific inhibitors. In conclusion, our results suggest that parkin accelerates the degradation of α-synuclein via the activation of the nonproteasomal protease, calpain, leading to the prevention of α-synuclein-induced cell death in embryonic hippocampal progenitor cells.

Lozano A.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 1130-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). PD patients suffer from rigidity, slowness of movement, tremor, and lack of balance. The etiology of PD is poorly understood, but genetic factors are believed to play an important role in its pathophysiology (2Golbe L.I. Neurology. 1990; 40: 7-14PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gasser T. Adv. Neurol. 2001; 86: 23-32PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that familial PD involves mutations in three different genes. First, two missense mutations of the α-synuclein gene have been linked to familial PD (4Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R. Stenroos E.S. Chandrasekharappa S. Athanassiadou A. Papapetropoulos T. Johnson W.G. Lazzarini A.M. Duvoisin R.C. Di Iorio G. Golbe L.I. Nussbaum R.L. Science. 1997; 276: 2045-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (6556) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies (LBs), the pathological hallmark of PD and dementia with LBs (5Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (6037) Google Scholar). Second, the ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1) gene has also been linked to some cases of familial PD. A missense mutation in UCH-L1 was identified in two members of the same kin having early onset autosomal dominant and typical PD (6Leroy E. Boyer R. Auburger G. Leube B. Ulm G. Mezey E. Harta G. Brownstein M.J. Jonnalagada S. Chernova T. Dehejia A. Lavedan C. Gasser T. Steinbach P.J. Wilkinson K.D. Polymeropoulos M.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 451-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). UCH-L1 appears to be involved in scavenging the ubiquitin peptide after the ubiquitin molecule has tagged the damaged molecules for proteasomal degradation. Third, parkin is the causative gene of early onset autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism (AR-JP) (7Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4140) Google Scholar, 8Saito M. Maruyama M. Ikeuchi K. Kondo H. Ishukawa A. Yuasa T. Tsuji S. Brain Dev. 2000; 22: 115-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Recently, parkin has been reported to be an ubiquitin-protein ligase E3 (9Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar, 10Zhang Y. Gao J. Chung K.K. Huang H. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Various mutations of parkin have been reported in AR-JP patients, including exon deletion, exon multiplication and point mutation (11Hattori N. Shimura H. Kubo S. Kitada T. Wang M. Asakawa S. Minashima S. Shimizu N. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Mizuno Y. Neuropathology. 2000; 20: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Parkin consists of two functionally different domains: the C-terminal RING box, which recruits a specific E2 enzyme, and the N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain required for the recognition of the target protein, which is to be ubiquitinated before proteasomal degradation. Various mutations of parkin are believed to be involved in the impairment of the normal metabolism of target proteins by proteasome, and the accumulations of unknown protein may cause AR-JP. Whereas missense mutations in α-synuclein or UCH-L1 cause rare autosomal dominant forms of PD, mutations of parkin are a relatively common cause of AR-JP. As is the case in conventional idiopathic PD, the neuropathologic changes of parkin-linked AR-JP are largely confined to the brain stem and include the loss of selected neurons and local gliosis. However, α-synuclein- and ubiquitin-positive neuronal inclusions, LBs, are generally absent in parkin-linked AR-JP (11Hattori N. Shimura H. Kubo S. Kitada T. Wang M. Asakawa S. Minashima S. Shimizu N. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Mizuno Y. Neuropathology. 2000; 20: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Yoshikawa M. Kitada T. Matsumine H. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Yamamura Y. Shimizu N. Mizuno Y. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 45: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 13Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Based on the mutation in UCH-L1 and parkin, it is suggested that the impaired proteasomal degradation of abnormal proteins seems to underlie the pathogenesis of PD. In addition, the previous report that the mRNA expression patterns of parkin and α-synuclein are remarkably similar (14Solano S.M. Miller D.W. Augood S.J. Young A.B. Penney J.B. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) suggested that these two proteins may be involved in common pathways, which contribute to the pathophysiology of PD. The substrate proteins for parkin remain largely unknown, with the exception of CDCrel-1 (15Peng X.R. Jia Z. Zhang Y. Ware J. Trimble W.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and the Pael receptor (16Imai Y. Soda M. Inoue H. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Takahashi R. Cell. 2001; 105: 891-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). In PD, parkin is co-localized in some LBs (17Schlossmacher M.G. Frosch M.P. Gai W.P. Medina M. Sharma N. Forno L. Ochiishi T. Shimura H. Sharon R. Hattori N. Langston J.W. Mizuno Y. Hyman B.T. Selkoe D.J. Kosik K.S. Am. J.

Cochran E. Lee J.M. Wolozin B. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 2839-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which contain aggregated α-synuclein. The association between parkin and α-synuclein in LB suggests that parkin interacts with α-synuclein, and this interaction may play a role in the pathogenesis of PD. On the basis of the above reports, the objective of the present study was to investigate the functional relationship between parkin and α-synuclein in immortalized hippocampal progenitor cells. Materials—Fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), and Geneticin were purchased from Invitrogen. Plasmids encoding epitope-tagged human wild type parkin (pcDNA3.1Myc-parkin) and its serial deletion mutants, amino acids 77–465, 217–465, 295–465, 1–415, and 1–310 of parkin, cloned in pcDNA3.1-Myc vectors were prepared, as described elsewhere (9Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). Plasmid, used to express jellyfish green fluorescent protein, fused with a noncleavable mutant ubiquitin (Ub) moiety as a substrate for ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent proteolysis, UbG76VGFP, was a gift from M. Masucci (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden). Clastolactacystin β-lactone and N-succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Suc-LLVY-AMC) were purchased from Biomol; a colorimetric caspase substrate, acetyl-DEVD-p-nitroaniline, calpastatin peptide, and calpeptin were from Calbiochem; and monoclonal antibody against β-O-linked N-acetylglucosamine was purchased from Babco. Rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma, and polyclonal anti-Myc and anti-PARP antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). All other chemicals used were commercial products of analytical grade obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—The rat neuronal hippocampal progenitor cell line (H19-7) was generated by transduction with retroviral vectors containing a temperature-sensitive SV40 large T antigen, which is functionally active at 33 °C and inactive at 39 °C (19Eves E.M. Tucker M.S. Roback J.D. Downen M. Rosner M.R. Wainer B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4373-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The undifferentiated and proliferating H19-7 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 33 °C and maintained under the selection of 200 g/ml G418. The cells were transfected with various expression vectors using LipofectAMINE plus reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total amount of DNA in each individual transfection experiment was adjusted by using parental empty vector DNA. The cells were cultured for at least 24 h after transfection and used in the subsequent immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis, and cell viability assay experiments. Assessment of Cell Viability by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) Extraction Assay—Quantitation of cell survival was performed using the tetrazolium salt extraction method (20Chung K.C. Park J.H. Kim C.H. Ahn Y.S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 62.5 μl of the 5 mg/ml stock solution of MTT was added to each well containing 250 μl of medium in a 24-well plate. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, 250 μl of extraction buffer containing 20% SDS and 50% N,N-dimethylformamide, at pH 7.4, was added. After incubating the reagents overnight at 37 °C, the optical density was measured at 570 nm using a SpectraMAX340 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), with extraction buffer used as a standard. Statistical analyses were completed with the aid of the StatView II program for Macintosh computers (Abacus Concepts). All data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and preplanned comparisons with the control were performed by Dunnett's T-statistic. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—The H19-7 cells were transfected with a mammalian expression vector using LipofectAMINE. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were washed with cold PBS buffer and harvested in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm NaF. The supernatant was then preincubated at 4 °C overnight with anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The supernatant was combined with 30 μl of Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and left at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by being washed thoroughly three times with lysis buffer. The precipitate was resolved on SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to Western blot analysis. Pulse-chasing Analysis of α-Synuclein—After H19-7 cells were transiently transfected with the plasmids encoding α-synuclein or/and parkin in H19-7 cells for 24 h, the cells were washed in PBS and incubated with methionine-free DMEM and labeled with [35S]methionine (10 μCi/ml) for 8 h and washed in PBS. Next the cells were washed extensively with DMEM, incubated with DMEM, and lysed in TLB. Primary antibody against α-synuclein was added to the cell lysates, and the Protein A-Sepharose bead samples were added to cell lysate mixtures and incubated for 1 h. Immunoprecipitated samples were washed three times in lysis buffer and solubilized by boiling the sample for 5 min. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue dye, dried, and analyzed by autoradiography. Measurement of Calpain and Caspase-3 Activity Using a Fluorescent Substrate Peptide—The activities of calpain and caspase-3 can be determined using the highly fluorescent peptide substrate, Suc-LLVY-AMC, for calpain and a colorimetric acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroaniline (Ac-DEVD-pNA) for caspase. After either Suc-LLVY-AMC (80 μm) or Ac-DEVD-pNA (10 μm) was added to the cells, the cell culture medium was harvested for assay of cleaved AMC and pNA. The formation of AMC was detected at λEX = 380/λEM = 460 by spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), whereas cleavage of pNA was monitored colorimetrically at 405 nm by spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad). To measure the in situ calpain activity in individual neuronal cells using Boc-Leu-Met-7-amino-4-chloromethylcoumarin (Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC), the H19-7 cells were mounted on fluorescence microscopy (excitation 380 nm; a dichronic cut-off of 430 nm with emission wavelength of 510 nm). Then cell-permeable calpain substrate, Boc-Leu-Met conjugated to the fluorophore CMAC (Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in Me2SO, was added to the cells at a final concentration of 20 μm. Whereas the change in fluorescence over time intervals of 30–60 s was measured to minimize photobleaching, the average calpain activity in the cells to express Myc-parkin (minimum of five cells) was measured. Where specified, either calpain inhibitor or ionomycin was added to the cells, and the calpain activity was assessed in each individual cell. Indirect Fluorescence Microscopy—To assess the individual cells to overexpress parkin, H19-7 cells grown in 6-well plates on coverslips were transiently transfected with the Myc-parkin construct. Cells were then incubated with primary anti-Myc antibody for 1 h at 4 °C in DMEM supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and washed twice with PBS. The cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS for 15 min, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was blocked with blocking solution (0.05% Triton X-100/PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk) for 30 min at 37 °C. Goat anti-mouse rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody was then added for1hat37 °C. The cells were then washed seven times with 0.05% Triton X-100/PBS. Finally, the cells were fixed again with 3.7% formaldehyde. Coverslips were observed under Olympus epifluorescence microscope equipped with a fluorescence filter. Digital images of cells were recorded using a Leica DC200 camera. Parkin Selectively Binds to α-Synuclein in Hippocampal Progenitor H19-7 Cells—The parkin gene has been reported to be expressed in various stages of the central nervous system developmental process (21D'Agata V. Zhao W. Cavallaro S. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 75: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In both the rat and the mouse, parkin begins to be expressed at embryonic 15 days, and this continues until the late stage of fetal life in a manner parallel to that of central nervous system neural development. First, we examined whether parkin was expressed in our model system, a conditionally immortalized embryonic hippocampal progenitor cell line (H19-7). After the cell lysates were prepared from undifferentiated and proliferating H19-7 cells, the presence of the parkin protein was determined by Western blot analysis using polyclonal anti-parkin antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1A, the expression of parkin, corresponding to a molecular size of 52 kDa, was identified with an additional, unknown 50-kDa band, indicating that parkin is endogenously and significantly expressed in H19-7 cells. To detect the epitope-tagging parkin protein after the transient transfection of its construct into H19-7 cells, Western blot analysis was performed with anti-Myc antibodies. Compared with the mock-transfected control cells, the expression of the recombinant fusion proteins of parkin with the Myc peptide was identified (Fig. 1A). However, we had previously observed that the endogenous protein level of α-synuclein is too low to be detected in H19-7 cells (22Sung J.Y. Kim J. Paik S.R. Park J.H. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27441-27448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Second, in order to clarify the relationship between parkin and α-synuclein, we checked whether parkin binds to α-synuclein in a specific way in H19-7 cells. In a previous study, we observed that the exogenous addition of bacterially recombinant α-synuclein proteins leads to their intracellular transport, subsequently causing a significant necrotic-like cell death in the H19-7 cell (22Sung J.Y. Kim J. Paik S.R. Park J.H. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27441-27448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The neuronal cell death appeared to be correlated with the Rab5A-specific endocytosis of α-synuclein that subsequently caused the formation of Lewy body-like intracytoplasmic inclusions. This was further supported by the fact that the expression of GTPase-deficient Rab5A resulted in a significant decrease of its cytotoxicity as a result of incomplete endocytosis of α-synuclein (22Sung J.Y. Kim J. Paik S.R. Park J.H. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27441-27448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To determine whether exogenous α-synuclein interacts with parkin, 10 μm α-synuclein was added to the cells for 1 h, and then immunoprecipitation was performed using the anti-parkin antibody. Western blot analysis with anti-α-synuclein antibodies showed evidence of the expression of α-synuclein with an approximate 19-kDa molecular size in the immunoprecipitated protein complexes, indicating that intracellular parkin binds to α-synuclein (Fig. 1B). In order to determine whether intracellular transfected α-synuclein also binds to parkin, two mammalian expression vectors encoding α-synuclein and Myc-tagged parkin (pcDNA3.1-Myc/His), respectively, were cotransfected into the H19-7 cells in a transient manner. After 48 h, immunoprecipitation was performed with an anti-Myc antibody, and the precipitates were analyzed by Western blot analysis using the anti-α-synuclein antibody. As shown in Fig. 1C, parkin selectively binds to α-synuclein. These findings suggest that parkin is functionally linked to α-synuclein in the embryonic hippocampal cell lines. Parkin Binds to α-Synuclein through Its Ubl Domain—To explore the domain in parkin that is associated with its interaction with α-synuclein, binding assays were performed using several deletion mutants of parkin (Fig. 2A). Plasmids, encoding a series of deletion parkin mutants with Myc tag, were co-transfected into H19-7 cells using a plasmid to express wild type α-synuclein, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-α-synuclein IgG. Apart from the whole complete protein, only the peptide, with its N-terminal portion of parkin remaining intact, still retained the binding activity to α-synuclein, whereas the peptide with its C-terminal part intact did not retain this binding activity (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the loss of the N-terminal Ubl domain of parkin resulted in the complete failure of the specific interaction with α-synuclein, indicating that the Ubl domain of parkin is essential for its binding to α-synuclein. Parkin Suppresses the α-Synuclein-induced Cytotoxicity via the Selective Degradation of Its Intracytoplasmic Inclusions— Next, to examine the physiological relevance of the specific binding between α-synuclein and parkin, the effect of intracellular overexpression of α-synuclein on cell viability was assessed. Following the transient transfection of a plasmid encoding α-synuclein into H19-7 cells, the change of cell viability was measured after 24 h by means of the MTT extraction method. As shown in Fig. 3, the overexpression of α-synuclein decreased cell viability in H19-7 cells. Interestingly, when α-synuclein was co-expressed with parkin, simultaneously, parkin significantly suppressed α-synuclein-induced cell death (Fig. 3). Meanwhile, the overexpression of parkin alone has no remarkable effect on cell viability. These data indicated that the overexpression of α-synuclein leads to neuronal cell death, whereas parkin selectively blocks the cytotoxicity of α-synuclein. Based on the previous findings that α-synuclein is degraded by 26 S proteasome (22Sung J.Y. Kim J. Paik S.R. Park J.H. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27441-27448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and parkin acts as ubiquitinprotein ligase E3 (9Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar, 10Zhang Y. Gao J. Chung K.K. Huang H. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 23Imai Y. Soda M. Takahashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35661-35664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), the protective effect of parkin on α-synuclein toxicity could be exerted by means of the removal of α-synuclein, by parkin-mediated ubiquitination of α-synuclein and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. Previously, we have shown that the H19-7 cells were not found to contain any significant levels of α-synuclein (22Sung J.Y. Kim J. Paik S.R. Park J.H. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27441-27448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), which is consistent with a previous report in which α-synuclein only begins to be expressed after the post-natal period in the rat central nervous system (24Hsu L.J. Mallory M. Xia Y. Veinbergs I. Hashimoto M. Yoshimoto M. Thal L.J. Saitoh T. Masliah E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether parkin controls the degradation of intracellular α-synuclein, H19-7 cells were transiently transfected with either a plasmid encoding α-synuclein or parkin. Western blot analysis with anti-Myc or anti-α-synuclein antibodies confirmed that α-synuclein and parkin were properly expressed inside the cells (Fig. 4A). However, when the plasmids of both α-synuclein and parkin were cotransfected into H19-7 cells, the levels of intracellular α-synuclein were significantly diminished in proportion to the amount of parkin DNA to be transfected (Fig. 4B). In addition to the measurement of steady state levels of α-synuclein, a pulse-chase experiment was performed to determine the rate of α-synuclein degradation. After H19-7 cells were transfected with either an expression vector encoding α-synuclein alone or with parkin plasmid in a transient manner, both cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-α-synuclein antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4C, co-transfection of parkin plus α-synuclein led to a significant increase in the rate of α-synuclein degradation in a dose-dependent way of the amount of parkin-encoding construct, compared with control cells transfected with α-synuclein alone (Fig. 4C). These findings suggested that parkin promotes the degradation of α-synuclein in H19-7 cells. In addition, the cytoprotective effect of parkin on α-synuclein-induced neurotoxicity was found to be proportional to the amount of parkin plasmids to be transfected (data not shown).Fig. 4Parkin enhances the degradation of nonglycosylated α-synuclein in H19-7 cells. A, where specified, H19-7 cells were mock-transfected (Con) or transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding α-synuclein (Syn) or parkin (PRK), separately. After 48 h of incubation, total cell lysates were obtained in 1× lysis buffer containing Triton X-100, and the expression of each protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis with either anti-Myc or anti-α-synuclein antibodies (α-Syn), as indicated. B. Where specified, H19-7 cells were mock-transfected or transiently transfected with either a plasmid encoding 1 μg of α-synuclein (pSyn) alone or with the same plasmid plus a cDNA construct (1 or 5 μg) to express wild type parkin (pPRK) for 48 h, as indicated. After the cell lysates were isolated, Western blot analysis was performed with monoclonal anti-α-synuclein antibodies. C, H19-7 cells were transiently transfected with the plasmids encoding α-synuclein (pSyn, α-S) and/or parkin (pPRK), as indicated. After 24 h, the cells were washed in PBS, incubated with methionine-free DMEM plus [35S]methionine (10 μCi/ml) for 8 h and washed in PBS. Next the cells were washed extensively with DMEM, incubated for the indicated times, and lysed in TLB. Primary antibody against α-synuclein was added to the cell lysates, and protein A-Sepharose bead mixtures were added and incubated for an additional 1 h. Immunoprecipitated samples were washed three times in lysis buffer and solubilized by boiling samples for 5 min. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue dye, dried, and analyzed by autoradiagraphy. D, H19-7 cells were untreated (C) or transiently transfected with plasmids to express wild type α-synuclein (S, α-S, or α-Syn) and/or parkin (P), as indicated. The cell lysates were incubated with monoclonal anti-α-synuclein antibody or anti-p53 IgG at 4 °C overnight, and protein A-Sepharose beads were added to the cell lysates for2hat4 °C with gentle rotation. Bound proteins were dissociated by boiling, and the protein samples were separated through a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted with either monoclonal antibody against α-synuclein or monoclonal anti-O-GlcNAc antibody, as indicated.

Other γ-secretase components include presenilin-1 (PS1), APH-1, and PEN-2, all of which span the membrane multiple times. The mechanism by which NCT associates with the γ-secretase complex and regulates its activity is unclear. To avoid the misfolding phenotype often associated with introducing deletions or mutations into heavily glycosylated and disulfide-bonded proteins such as NCT, we produced chimeras between human (hNCT) and Caenorhabditis elegans NCT (ceNCT). Although ceNCT did not associate with human γ-secretase components, all of the ceNCT/hNCT chimeras interacted with γ-secretase components from human, C. elegans, or both, indicating that they folded correctly. A region at the C-terminal end of hNCT, encompassing the last 50 residues of its ectodomain, the transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic domain was important for mediating interactions with human PS1, APH-1, and PEN-2. This finding is consistent with the fact that the bulk of the γ-secretase complex proteins resides within the membrane, with relatively small extramembranous domains. Finally, hNCT associated with hAPH-1 in the absence of PS, consistent with NCT and APH-1 forming a subcomplex prior to association with PS1 and PEN-2 and indicating that the interactions between NCT with PS1 may be indirect or stabilized by the presence of APH-1.

The Aβ peptide is generated from proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a type I transmembrane glycoprotein (3Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P.

APP is cleaved by two distinct enzymatic activities, which result in the production of an array of Aβ species that differ only slightly in length but vary greatly in their abilities to aggregate (4Wang R.

In the amyloidogenic pathway, APP is first cleaved by β-site APP cleaving enzyme, which cuts at a luminal site generating C-terminal APP fragments, and subsequently within its transmembrane domain by γ-secretase to generate Aβ peptides and an intracellular APP C-terminal domain (5Xia W.

PEN-2 is a protein of 101-amino acid length that traverses the membrane twice, with both its C- and N-terminal domains facing the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (22Crystal A.S. Morais V.A.

Studies performed in Drosophila melanogaster have shown that NCT appears to stabilize PS1 and to be critical for trafficking of PS1 to the cell surface (14Chung H.M. Struhl G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Conversely, PS1 is required for the maturation and trafficking of NCT (27Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 28Kaether C. Lammich S. Edbauer D. Ertl M. Rietdorf J. Capell A. Steiner H. Haass C. J.

Relatively little is known about the role of NCT in the γ-secretase complex, except that it is a required component (30Li T. Ma G. Cai H. Price D.L. Wong P.C. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Formally, it is not even known if NCT interacts directly with PS1, because coimmunoprecipitation results could be due to indirect PS1-NCT interactions mediated by APH-1, PEN-2, or other molecules. Studies designed to investigate how NCT associates with γ-secretase have largely relied on the introduction of deletions within NCT. Deletion of a 29- or a 58-residue region in the NCT ectodomain that encompasses a conserved DYIGS sequence reduced Aβ secretion, whereas a double-point mutation within this sequence (D336A/Y337A) increased Aβ production (17Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T. Supala A. Levesque L. Yu H. Yang D.S. Holmes E. Milman P. Liang Y. Zhang D.M. Xu D.H. Sato C. Rogaev E.

A recent study found that multiple deletions within the ectodomain of NCT, each encompassing at least 50 amino acids, prevented its association with PS1 (31Shirotani K. Edbauer D. Capell A. Schmitz J. Steiner H. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16474-16477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, large deletions within the ectodomains of extensively disulfide-bonded proteins that bear multiple N-linked glycosylation sites frequently result in misfolding (43Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). Failure of a misfolded protein to associate with its normal assembly partners may not reflect the loss of a region or sequence that is in fact important for mediating relevant protein-protein interactions. In the absence of evidence that modified proteins fold normally, it is difficult to draw conclusions about domains that are important for function. To investigate determinants in human NCT (hNCT) that mediate its interaction with PS1, APH-1, and PEN-2, we developed a strategy in which we produced chimeras by exchanging domains between hNCT and Caenorhabditis elegans NCT (ceNCT), and examined their ability to interact with human γ-secretase complex components as judged by coimmunoprecipitation. Importantly, we found that each chimera folded correctly, because each colocalized in part with the Golgi marker GM130, and each associated with γ-secretase components derived from human, C. elegans, or both. We found that a chimera containing amino acids 628–721 of hNCT in a ceNCT background could be efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with the human γ-secretase complex components, whereas the reciprocal chimera failed to stably associate with hPS1. This region contains 50 amino acids of ectodomain adjacent to the transmembrane domain (TMD), the TMD, and the C-terminal domain of hNCT. We note that this region is likely to be relevant for mediating interactions with PS-1, APH-1, and PEN-2, because the bulk of these three proteins resides within the membrane, with relatively small ecto- and cytoplasmic domains. Finally, studies performed in PS1/PS2-negative (PS–/–) mouse cells showed that hNCT associated with APH-1 in the absence of PS, raising the possibility that hNCT interactions with PS1 within the complex may be indirect, and indicating that APH-1 and NCT can form a subcomplex prior to association with PS. Generation of NCT Chimera Constructs—The cDNA encoding hNCT was a kind gift from Dr. Sangram Sisodia (University of Chicago, IL) and was cloned into pcDNA3.1D/V5 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with and without the V5 tag epitope at the C terminus of the protein. C. elegans γ-secretase components (cePS1 or Sel-12, ceAPH-1, cePEN-2, ceNCT, or APH-2) were cloned from C. elegans cDNA, a kind gift from Dr. Meera Sundaram (University of Pennsylvania, PA). Primers were synthesized according to published sequences, and standard PCR technology was used to clone into pcDNA3.1/V5. cePS1, ceAPH-1, cePEN-2, and ceNCT constructs contained either the C-terminal influenza hemagglutinin epitope tag (HA tag) or the C-terminal V5 tag (Invitrogen). The construction of the PS1 (32Kovacs D.M. Fausett H.J. Page K.J. Kim T.W. Moir R.D. Merriam D.E. Hollister R.D. Hallmark O.G. Mancini R. Felsenstein K.M. Hyman B.T. Tanzi R.E. Wasco W. Nat.

Chimeras between hNCT and ceNCT were built using standard overlapping PCR technology. Regions of ceNCT were replaced with the corresponding regions of hNCT as follows: for ceNCT-h(35–152) amino acids (aa) 35–152 were replaced by aa 50–159 of hNCT, for ceNCT-h(152–305) aa 152–305 were replaced by aa 159–301, for ce-NCT-h(305–400) aa 305–400 were replaced by aa 301–379, for ceNCT-h(400–521) aa 400–521 were replaced by aa 379–514, for ceNCT-h(521–628) aa 521–628 were replaced by aa 514–620, for ceNCT-h(628–721) aa 628–721 were replaced by aa 620–709, for ceNCT-h(1–628) aa 1–628 were replaced by aa 1–620, for ceNCT-h(628–680) aa 628–680 were replaced by aa 620–669, for ceNCT-h(680–701) aa 680–701 were replaced by aa 669–689, and for ceNCT-h(701–721) aa 701–721 were replaced by aa 688–709. hNCT, ceNCT, and the chimeras were detected through the introduction of the V5 tag epitope at the C terminus of each protein. Antibodies for Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For the immunoprecipitation studies, anti-PS1M an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against amino acids 295–380 of hPS1 was used (22Crystal A.S. Morais V.A. Pierson T.C. Pijak D.S. Carlin D. Lee V.M.-Y. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20117-20123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The HA epitope tag was detected with monoclonal or rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Covance, Richmond, CA) for Western blot and immunoprecipitation studies, respectively. The V5 epitope tag was likewise detected with monoclonal (Invitrogen) or rabbit polyclonal (Sigma, Milwaukee, WI) antibodies. For immunofluorescence studies, a monoclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal region of the Golgi marker GM130 (BD Transductions Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ) was used. Cell Culture and Protein Expression—HEK293T and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, either wild-type (PS+/+) or deficient for both PS1 and PS2 (PS–/–), were described previously (21Zhang Z. Nadeau P. Song W. Donoviel D. Yuan M. Bernstein A. Yankner B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 463-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The PS–/– ES cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% FBS, nonessential amino acids, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 105 units/liter murine leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). For transient expression, quadruple transfections with PS1, APH-1-HA, PEN-2-HA, and hNCT or ceNCT or chimeras were performed in 10-cm2 dishes of HEK293T cells or ES cells (1 × 106 cell), and 2-cm2 dishes of HeLa cells. Transfections were performed with Gene Porter I Lipid transfection reagent (Gene Therapy System, San Diego, CA) according to the supplier's protocol. Protein Analysis—For protein analysis, 24-h post-transfection cell extracts were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Cell lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. SDS-PAGE was carried out using 4–15% Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), followed by Western blot analysis using horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody followed by visualization with ECL-Plus Western blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Coimmunoprecipitation—Coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed as previously described (22Crystal A.S. Morais V.A. Pierson T.C. Pijak D.S. Carlin D. Lee V.M.-Y. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20117-20123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T and ES PS–/– cells (1 × 106 cell) overexpressing combinations of hPS1, hAPH-1-HA, hPEN-2-HA, and epitope-tagged hNCT or NCT chimeras were lysed with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPSO, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture. Pre-cleared lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-PS1M antibody, anti-HA tag, or anti-V5 tag antibodies previously coupled to protein A/G Plus-agarose beads. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted at 100 °C for 5 min with 20 μl of Sample Buffer (0.08 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% bromphenol blue). Samples were analyzed by Western blot as described above. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HeLa cells grown to 50% confluency on glass coverslips were transfected with pcDNA3.1/PS1, pcDNA3.1/APH-1-HA, pcDNA3.1/PEN-2-HA, and hNCT-V5- or V5-tagged chimeras. 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 5 μg/ml cyclohexamide for 3 h. Cells were washed with PBS containing 0.5 mm MgCl2 and were fixed for 10 min with 2% (w/v) formaldehyde in PBS. Cells were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the primary antibodies, anti-V5 tag (Sigma) and anti-GM130 (BD Transduction Laboratories) in PBS containing 4% FBS and 0.02% saponin. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 (goat anti-rabbit) and Alexa Fluor 594 (goat anti-mouse) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) diluted 1:500 in 4% FBS in PBS with 0.02% saponin. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole was added to the secondary antibody mixture at a dilution of 1:1000. Cells were washed in PBS, mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL), and examined on a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal microscope. Lack of Association of ceNCT with Human γ-Secretase Complex Components—To identify domains in hNCT that mediate interactions with γ-secretase components, we sought to identify a nonhuman homolog that, although failing to associate with human PS1 (hPS1), would allow the generation of correctly folded NCT chimeras due to generally conserved structural elements. Such an approach would likely avoid the misfolding problems that typically arise when large deletions are introduced into a heavily glycosylated and disulfide bonded protein such as NCT. Studies performed in C. elegans have shown that ceNCT, also named APH-2, has a genetic interaction with cePS1 (also known as Sel-12) and that ceNCT is an essential component of many Notch-mediated interactions (11Kopan R. Goate A. Neuron. 2002; 33: 321-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Overall, ceNCT and hNCT exhibit 41% amino acid homology and 20% amino acid identity, including the conservation of 9 of 12 ectodomain Cys residues. In addition, hNCT can partially rescue the genetic phenotype caused by ablation of ceNCT in C. elegans, confirming that the two proteins are functionally related (26Levitan D. Yu G. St George Hyslop P. Goutte C. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 654-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To determine if ceNCT could associate with human γ-secretase complex components, we transiently expressed ceNCT or hNCT in HEK293T cells along with hPS1, hAPH-1, and hPEN-2. Transfection efficiencies were monitored by the use of a green fluorescent protein expression plasmid in this and subsequent experiments to ensure comparable transfection efficiencies. Cells were lysed in 1% CHAPSO, and immunoprecipitations were performed with an antibody against PS1. As expected, hNCT migrated as a doublet, representing endoglycosidase H-sensitive immature (∼110 kDa) and partially resistant mature (∼150 kDa) forms. Western blot analysis revealed that transiently expressed ceNCT did not stably interact with hPS1 as judged by coimmunoprecipitation, whereas hNCT did (Fig. 1). ceNCT expression was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with an antibody against the V5 epitope tag present at the C terminus of ceNCT. Transient expression levels of hPS1 were confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1, bottom panel). Interestingly, we observed that ceNCT did not become endoglycosidase H-resistant in HEK293T cells, even when coexpressed with ceAPH-1, cePEN-2, and cePS1 (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Our results suggest that, although hNCT is capable of at least partially rescuing the ceNCT-negative phenotype in C. elegans cells, the reverse situation may not occur due to the failure of ceNCT to stably associate with hPS1. Expression of Chimeras between hNCT and ceNCT—To identify regions in hNCT that mediate interactions with γ-secretase complex components, chimeras between hNCT and ceNCT were constructed in which regions of ceNCT were replaced with the corresponding hNCT domains (Fig. 2). Chimeras were designed so that cysteine residues were conserved and, to normalize detection, a V5 epitope tag was added at the C terminus of each construct. The chimeras were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells along with hPS1, hAPH-1, and hPEN-2. Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3) of cell lysates showed that the chimeras were well expressed and that their electrophoretic mobilities were consistent with their predicted molecular weights, although chimera ceNCT-h(521–628) sometimes exhibited a lower molecular weight fragment. Mass differences were largely due to different numbers of N-linked glycosylation sites in the various chimeras (Fig. 2).Fig. 3Analysis of chimeras between hNCT and ceNCT. HEK293T cells transiently overexpressing hPS1, hAPH-1, hPEN-2, and NCT or the indicated NCT chimera were lysed in CHAPSO and immunoprecipitated with an antibody to the V5 epitope tag present at the C terminus of each NCT construct. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot with an antibody to the V5-epitope tag to monitor expression of NCT and the NCT chimeras.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Association of Chimeras with Human γ-Secretase Complex Components—To determine if the chimeras were able to interact with γ-secretase components, coimmunoprecipitation studies with HEK293T cells overexpressing hPS1, hAPH-1, hPEN-2, and the indicated chimeras were performed (Fig. 4). The efficiency of the immunoprecipitation assay conditions used throughout this report were ∼90% (data not shown). Only chimera ceNCT-h(628–721) was coimmunoprecipitated with an antibody to PS1 (Fig. 4A). This chimera could also be coimmunoprecipitated with antibodies to either PEN-2 or APH-1 (Fig. 4, B and C). Transient expression levels of hPS1, hPEN-2, hAPH-1, and corresponding NCT chimeras (Fig. 4, A–D; bottom portion of each panel) were monitored by Western blot. These results suggest that ceNCT is capable of establishing a stable interaction with human γ-secretase complex components when amino acids 628–721 were replaced with the corresponding hNCT (620–709) region. This region contains a 50-amino acid stem region adjacent to the TMD, the TMD itself, and the entire intracellular C-terminal domain. Chimeras That Fail to Associate with Human γ-Secretase Complex Components Bind to C. elegans γ-Secretase—The failure of most chimeras to associate with hPS1, hAPH-1, and hPEN-2 could be due to the absence of important hNCT sequences in a largely ceNCT background. Alternatively, some chimeras may not fold correctly, making their failure to associate with γ-secretase components largely irrelevant. To investigate this possibility, we monitored the transport of each chimera by immunofluorescence microscopy and measured their ability to interact with cePS1, ceAPH-1, and cePEN-2. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy studies of HeLa cells overexpressing each chimera showed that each partially colocalized with GM130, a cis-Golgi marker (Fig. 5). This result suggests that all of the chimeras folded sufficiently well so that they were able to pass the quality control mechanisms resident in the ER that prevent transport of misfolded proteins (43Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). To more directly monitor protein folding, we determined if the chimeras interacted with C. elegans γ-secretase components cePS1, ceAPH-1, and cePEN-2. HEK293T cells overexpressing these components (Fig. 6A) and the indicated chimeras were lysed and either subjected to Western blot analysis against the V5 epitope tag present on the chimeras to monitor expression (Fig. 6B) or coimmunoprecipitation using the HA epitope tag present on the C. elegans γ-secretase components (Fig. 6C). All of the chimeras could be efficiently coimmunoprecipitated, indicating that each folded correctly and could stably interact with C. elegans γ-secretase complex components. Chimera ceNCT-h(521–628) was coimmunoprecipitated inefficiently in the experiment shown, but was also expressed at relatively low levels. In other experiments, this chimera was coimmunoprecipitated as efficiently as the other chimeras. To confirm that the coimmunoprecipitations were specific, we also performed coimmunoprecipitations with the anti-HA tag antibody using cell lysates overexpressing V5-tagged cePS1, ceAPH-1, and cePEN-2. None of the chimeras were detected under these conditions (data not shown). Taken together, our results show that all of the chimeras folded sufficiently well to allow exit from the ER and for the specific association with human γ-secretase, C. elegans γ-secretase, or both"

A subset of these detergent-resistant membranes (DRM-H) exhibits a higher buoyant density (∼1.16 g/ml) because of association with membrane skeleton proteins, including actin, myosin II, myosin 1G, fodrin, and an actin- and membrane-binding protein called supervillin (Nebl, T., Pestonjamasp, K. N., Leszyk, J. D., Crowley, J. L., Oh, S. W., and Luna, E. J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 43399-43409). To characterize interactions among DRM-H cytoskeletal proteins, we investigated the binding partners of the novel supervillin N terminus, specifically amino acids 1-830. We find that the supervillin N terminus binds directly to myosin II, as well as to F-actin. Three F-actin-binding sites were mapped to sequences within amino acids ∼280-342, ∼344-422, and ∼700-830. Sequences with combinations of these sites promote F-actin cross-linking and/or bundling. Supervillin amino acids 1-174 specifically interact with the S2 domain in chicken gizzard myosin and nonmuscle myosin IIA (MYH-9) but exhibit little binding to skeletal muscle myosin II. Direct or indirect binding to filamin also was observed. Overexpression of supervillin amino acids 1-174 in COS7 cells disrupted the localization of myosin IIB without obviously affecting actin filaments. Taken together, these results suggest that supervillin may mediate actin and myosin II filament organization at cholesterol-rich membrane domains.

Compartmentalized signaling involving cholesterol-rich, liquid-ordered membrane domains occurs during cell activation triggered by receptor cross-linking, growth factors, or other extracellular stimuli (1Anderson R.G.

Although we do not know the precise molecular mechanisms by which the redistributions of plasma membrane domains occur, an active role of the actin-based membrane skeleton has long been postulated (reviewed in Ref. 9Bourguignon L.Y. Bourguignon G.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1984; 87: 195-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Redistributions of activated or cross-linked receptors are accompanied by corresponding changes in the localizations of actin, nonmuscle myosin II, spectrin, and associated cytoskeletal proteins (9Bourguignon L.Y. Bourguignon G.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1984; 87: 195-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Furthermore, disruption of actin filament integrity inhibits many lipid raft-mediated processes, including epidermal growth factor receptor capping in A431 cells (10Khrebtukova I.A. Kwiatkowska K.

Taken together, these observations suggest that actin filaments, perhaps as components of a spectrin-based membrane skeleton, are required for the anchorage of many receptors to lipid rafts, or as tracks for myosin-driven lateral movements of membrane proteins during signaling, or as part of both processes. Lipid raft components may be isolated by flotation into low buoyant density sucrose fractions after treatment of cells or membranes with cold Triton X-100 (3Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5164) Google Scholar). During this procedure, the ∼50-nm liquid-ordered domains present in unactivated cells (22Pralle A. Keller P. Florin E.L. Simons K. Horber J.K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 997-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 23Varma M. Leavitt J. Mutat.

J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 655-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 3Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5164) Google Scholar). Both lipid rafts and DRMs contain resident integral membrane proteins, such as caveolin, stomatin, and flotillin, and signaling proteins, including heterotrimeric G proteins and members of the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases (24Galbiati F. Razani B. Lisanti M.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 403-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Raft-associated integral membrane and signaling proteins in bovine neutrophil plasma membranes sediment in sucrose gradients as both “light” (DRM-L) and “heavy” (DRM-H) fractions with buoyant densities of ∼1.09-1.13 and ∼1.15-1.18 g/ml, respectively (25Nebl T. Pestonjamasp K.N. Leszyk J.D. Crowley J.L. Oh S.W. Luna E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43399-43409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The neutrophil DRM-H fraction also contains a subset of cytoskeletal proteins, including actin, myosin II, fodrin, α-actinins 1 and 4, vimentin, myosin 1G, and the actin-binding protein supervillin. Most of the integral, signaling, and cytoskeletal proteins in the DRM-H fraction continue to co-sediment with each other after solubilization of raft lipids with octylglucoside, indicating that these proteins are associated through interactions exclusive of those with the bilayer. Supervillin, myosin II, and myosin 1G remain bound to the bilayer after a high pH carbonate extraction, suggesting that these proteins are more proximal to the membrane than are the other DRM-H cytoskeletal proteins. Thus, the DRM-H fraction consists of an actin- and fodrin-based membrane skeleton that is associated with a subset of lipid raft signaling domains, possibly through interactions with supervillin and myosin. Similar raft-associated membrane skeletons may be present in many cell types. Supervillin is a constituent of total lipid rafts from Jurkat T cells (26von Haller P.D. Donohoe S. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Watts J.D. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1010-1021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is purified from HEK293 cells as part of a dodecyl maltoside-insoluble complex that also includes integrin β2, α-actinin, β-actin, P2X7 ATP receptors, laminin α3, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, and receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase-β (27Kim M. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6347-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). A muscle-specific isoform of supervillin, called archvillin, co-isolates with dystrophin and the raft-organizing protein, caveolin 3, in a low buoyant density fraction from skeletal muscle (28Oh S.W. Pope R.K. Smith K.P. Crowley J.L. Nebl T. Lawrence J.B. Luna E.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2261-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Supervillin, so-named because of C-terminal similarities to the microvillar protein villin, binds directly and specifically to F-actin (29Pestonjamasp K. Amieva M.R. Strassel C.P. Nauseef W.M. Furthmayr H. Luna E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 30Pestonjamasp K.N. Pope R.K. Wulfkuhle J.D. Luna E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1255-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and localizes to sites of cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion in epithelial cells (30Pestonjamasp K.N. Pope R.K.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2125-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Archvillin localizes at costameres, specialized adhesion sites in muscle (28Oh S.W. Pope R.K. Smith K.P. Crowley J.L. Nebl T. Lawrence J.B. Luna E.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2261-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The shared N terminus of supervillin and archvillin is novel, lacking any similarity to the S1 domain in villin and gelsolin that is involved in actin filament severing activity (32Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Allen P.G. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R81-R85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 33Kwiatkowski D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 34Way M. Gooch J. Pope B. Weeds A.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Instead, the supervillin N terminus contains functional nuclear localization sequences and F-actin binding and bundling activities (31Wulfkuhle J.D. Donina I.E. Stark N.H. Pope R.K. Pestonjamasp K.N. Niswonger M.L. Luna E.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2125-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of supervillin or its N terminus disrupts stress fibers and vinculin-containing focal adhesions (31Wulfkuhle J.D. Donina I.E. Stark N.H. Pope R.K. Pestonjamasp K.N. Niswonger M.L. Luna E.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2125-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a role in the regulation of cell-substratum interactions. Dysfunction caused by overexpression of supervillin is supported by the increased levels of this protein found in many carcinoma cell lines (35Pope R.K. Pestonjamasp K.N. Smith K.P. Wulfkuhle J.D. Strassel C.P. Lawrence J.B. Luna E.J. Genomics. 1998; 52: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and by the demonstration that increased levels of supervillin can activate signaling through the androgen receptor (36Ting H.J. Yeh S. Nishimura K. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To understand better the role of supervillin at the membrane, we are mapping functional domains. Here we report the presence and localizations of a binding site for myosin II and three binding sites for filamentous actin within the supervillin N terminus. These F-actin-binding sites support filament bundling and cross-linking in vitro and thus can account for the observed aberrations in F-actin distributions documented in vivo (31Wulfkuhle J.D. Donina I.E. Stark N.H. Pope R.K. Pestonjamasp K.N. Niswonger M.L. Luna E.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2125-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The myosin II-binding site, which is also present in archvillin, selectively recognizes nonmuscle and smooth muscle myosin II isoforms, as opposed to skeletal muscle myosin II. This selectivity is consistent with the co-localization of archvillin with nonmuscle myosin II at the sarcolemma in differentiating and mature skeletal muscle (28Oh S.W. Pope R.K. Smith K.P. Crowley J.L. Nebl T. Lawrence J.B. Luna E.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2261-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the myosin II-binding sequence disrupts the co-localization of nonmuscle myosin IIB with actin filament bundles in COS7 cells, suggesting a role for supervillin, and by extension, archvillin, in the organization of actin and myosin II at liquid-ordered membrane domains. Glutathione-Sepharose™, PreScission™ Protease, and DEAE-Sephacryl™ were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Chicken gizzards were from Pel-Freez Biologicals (Rogers, AR).

EGFP-Supervillin—Bovine supervillin cDNA (NCBI Nucleotide Database accession number AF025996) was used as a template to generate by PCR chimeric cDNAs from forward and reverse primers with 5′ restriction enzyme sites for cloning into pGEM-T (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), pGEM-T Easy (Promega), or pCR2.1-TOPO® (Invitrogen) TA vectors. Primer and/or vector cloning sites were used to transfer supervillin sequences into the pGEX-6P-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) for expression as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST) and into pEGFP vectors (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) for mammalian cell expression (Table I).

DNA Sequencing—All PCR products in TA vectors were verified by sequencing at the Iowa State University DNA Sequencing and Synthesis Facility (Ames, IA) or at the University of Massachusetts Nucleic Acid Facility (Worcester, MA). Expression constructs were checked by sequencing through the cloning sites.

After cleavage of GST with PreScission™ Protease, the proteins were further purified by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacryl™ and elution with 0-0.2 m NaCl. The supervillin fragments were dialyzed against dialysis buffer (100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT in either 40 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, or 40 mm MOPS, pH 7.5). Dialyzed proteins were frozen quickly in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use. Muscle Proteins—G-actin was prepared from an acetone powder of rabbit skeletal muscle (38Spudich J.A. Watt S.

Smooth muscle myosin II was isolated from frozen turkey gizzards (44Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13146-13153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Smooth muscle myosin rod domain and light meromyosin (LMM) were generated by papain digestion (45Seidel J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4355-4361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and chymotryptic digestion (46Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2380-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), respectively. Smooth muscle HMM (Met1-Ser1110) and myosin subfragment-1 (S1, Met1-Gln856) were expressed from recombinant baculoviruses and purified (47Sata M. Ikebe M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2866-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Constructs encoding HMM C-terminal deletions (HMMΔ1, Met1-Glu1058; HMMΔ2, Met1-Asn1030), and myosin subfragment-2 (S2, Leu851-Glu1106) also were made, and the recombinant proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells. Essential and regulatory light chains were co-expressed and co-purified in association with HMM, HMMΔ1, HMMΔ2, and S1. COS7-2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transfected by electroporation (48Takizawa N. Schmidt D.J. Mabuchi K.

Leinwand L.A. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 86.2-86.3Google Scholar). For analysis of EGFP-tagged supervillin sequences by F-actin blot overlay and anti-EGFP staining, transfected cells were washed with PBS (pH 7.4) and harvested from 10-cm plates using 0.5 ml/plate of M-PER® Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent, 3 μm pepstatin, 2 μm leupeptin, 0.2 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), as described by the manufacturer (Pierce). Proteins were denatured by heating for 5 min at 95 °C in 2× SDS sample buffer and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (50Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA Protein Assays™ (Pierce). Gels were stained for protein with Coomassie Blue or electrotransferred to nitrocellulose (0.45-μm pore size; Schleicher & Schuell) for immunoblot analyses. Nitrocellulose blots were blocked with 5% nonfat powdered milk and probed with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies used in this study were diluted as follows: affinity-purified anti-supervillin (α-H340 (25Nebl T. Pestonjamasp K.N. Leszyk J.D. Crowley J.L. Oh S.W. Luna E.J. J. Biol.

Interacting antibodies were visualized using anti-mouse IgG, mouse IgM, or rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, an ECL substrate kit (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD), and Biomax-MS x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For double labeling with radioactively labeled F-actin, anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was used with a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate kit (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) for colorimetric detection. F-actin—125I-Labeled actin was prepared, polymerized in the presence of rabbit gelsolin, stabilized with phalloidin, and used at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml in 5% nonfat powered milk (41Luna E.J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In some experiments, actin was labeled with [α-32P]ATP (51Mackay D.J.G. Esch F. Furthmayr H. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), using 1 mg of actin and 1 mCi of [α-32P]ATP. Nitrocellulose blots were exposed to film, or the signal was visualized with a Phosphor Imager SI™ optical scanner and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). 35S-SV-(1-174)—In vitro transcription and translation of SV-(1-174) was carried out with the TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega Corp.) in the presence of ∼20 μCi of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 35S-Labeled SV-(1-174) was stored in 50-μl aliquots at -80 °C until use. For blot overlays with 35S-labeled SV-(1-174), proteins resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE gels were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose and blocked for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with 5% nonfat milk and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 in hybridization buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.7, 25 mm NaCl, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) (52Cavaillès V. Dauvois S. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10009-10013Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were denatured and renatured by a series of 10-min incubations at room temperature in hybridization buffer, 0.05% Nonidet P-40 plus the following concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride: 6, 6, 3, 1.5, 0.75, 0.375, and 0.187 m. After two additional 10-min washes with hybridization buffer, nonspecific sites on the filter were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% milk, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, hybridization buffer and for another hour at room temperature with 1% milk, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm methionine, hybridization buffer. Filters were incubated with 35S-labeled SV-(1-174) (25-50 μl) for 2.5 h at room temperature in 1 ml of H Buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.7, 75 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm methionine). Filters were washed five times for 1-2 min per wash with H Buffer and then exposed to film or a PhosphorImager screen. Proteins specifically bound to GST-SV-(1-174) were identified from tryptic digests of Coomassie Blue-stained polypeptides (53Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar) by Dr. John D. Leszyk, Proteomic Mass Spectrometry Laboratory of the University of Massachusetts Medical School (Shrewsbury, MA). PSD fragment ions were fitted to a generated curve, which was calibrated with PSD fragments from the synthetic peptide, P14R. Data base searches were performed using Protein Prospector (prospector.ucsf.edu). Average peptide masses were searched against the NCBI nonredundant data base using the MS-Fit program and 250-500 ppm mass tolerances with 1 or 2 missed cleavages. PSD fragments were searched against the NCBI nonredundant data base using MS-Tag and 0.5 Da as the parent tolerance and 1.0 Da as the fragment tolerance. Co-sedimentation binding assays were performed either by adding supervillin fragments cleaved from purified GST fusion proteins to pre-polymerized F-actin (Fig. 2A) or by co-polymerizing actin with GST fusion proteins (Fig. 2C). All proteins and G-actin in Buffer A were clarified by centrifugation at 250,000 × g for 21 min at 4 °C immediately before use. In co-polymerization experiments, G-actin, GST, or GST fusion proteins were mixed on ice and co-assembled in a final volume of 250 μl of an actin polymerization buffer (100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The final concentrations of actin, GST fusion proteins, and GST were 2.3, ∼2, and 3.5 μm, respectively. Assay mixtures were incubated on ice for 1 h and then for 1 h at 18-20 °C. Actin filaments in 150 μl of each assay mixture were centrifuged as above through 50 μl of 10% sucrose in actin polymerizing buffer. Supernatants were collected as the top 100 μl in each tube, the rest of the liquid was carefully removed, and pellets were resuspended to 150 μl with Buffer A. Equal volumes (30 μl) of supernatant and pellet fractions were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted with anti-GST antibody or stained with Coomassie Blue. Co-sedimentation experiments with pre-polymerized F-actin (1 mg/ml) and cleaved supervillin fragments (0.18 mg/ml) were performed similarly, except that the polymerization buffer contained 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, instead of Tris-HCl. Actin (1.25 mg/ml) was pre-polymerized for 30 min at 28 °C before addition of the supervillin fragments and continued incubation for 10 min at 28 °C. Actin viscosity was measured using a low shear falling ball viscometer (54Fowler V. Taylor D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 361-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 55Fowler V.M. Luna E.J.

These actions are mediated by the IGF-I receptor. How activation of the same receptor by the same ligand leads to these diverse cellular responses is not well understood. Here we describe a novel mechanism specifying VSMC responses to IGF-I stimulation, distinctive for the pivotal roles of local IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). The role of local IGFBPs was indicated by comparing the activities of IGF-I and des-1–3-IGF-I, an IGF-I analog with reduced binding affinity to IGFBPs. Compared with IGF-I, des-1–3-IGF-I was more potent in stimulating DNA synthesis but much less potent in inducing directed migration of VSMCs. When the effects of individual IGFBPs were tested, IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4 were found to inhibit IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis and migration. IGFBP-5 had an inhibitory effect on IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis, but it strongly potentiated IGF-I-induced VSMC migration. By using a non-IGF-binding IGFBP-5 mutant and an IGF-I-neutralizing antibody, it was demonstrated that IGFBP-5 also stimulates VSMC migration in an IGF-independent manner. This effect of IGFBP-5 was inhibited by soluble heparin and by treating cells with heparinase. Mutation of the heparin-binding motif of IGFBP-5 reduced its migration promoting activity. These findings suggest that local IGFBPs are important determinants of cellular responses to IGF-I stimulation, and a key player in this paradigm is IGFBP-5. IGFBP-5 not only modulates IGF-I actions, but it also stimulates cell migration by interacting with cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans.

In addition, IGFs have been shown to regulate VSMC differentiation, glucose uptake, protein synthesis, and contractility (10Sowers J.R. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These diverse actions of IGFs are mediated through the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) and its downstream signaling transducers, including mitogen-activated protein kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and protein kinase C (7Bai H.Z. Pollman M.J. Inishi Y. Gibbons G.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Duan C. Bauchat J.R. Hsieh T. Circ.

However, it remains poorly understood how activation of the same receptor by the same ligand(s) leads to these diverse, sometimes even mutually exclusive, cellular responses. It is now understood that most, if not all, IGFs in the extra-cellular environment are bound to specific, high affinity IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). IGFBPs are a family of secreted proteins that specifically bind IGF-I and IGF-II with affinities that are equal to or greater than those of the IGF-IR. Six distinct IGFBPs, designated as IGFBP-1–6, have been isolated and characterized from a variety of vertebrate species, ranging from humans to teleost fish (14Baxter R.C. Am. J.

The circulating IGF·IGFBP complexes prolong the half-lives of IGFs and inhibit the potential hypoglycemic effects of high concentrations of circulating IGFs. Locally expressed IGFBPs are thought to provide a means of localizing IGFs to specific cells and regulating their local availability and biological activity (14Baxter R.C. Am. J.

These IGFBPs, when added exogenously to cultured VSMCs in combination with IGF-I, can either inhibit or potentiate IGF-I-induced DNA synthesis and migration (6Duan C. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol.

Recent studies have also revealed that the abundance of these local IGFBPs vary significantly under different pathophysiological conditions and different cellular contexts. For example, higher levels of IGFBP-5 were found in atherosclerotic plaques compared with tissue from the normal vessel wall (27Zheng B. Duan C. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8994-9000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In vitro, synthetic VSMCs maintained on fibronectin synthesize and release more IGFBP-5 compared with differentiated contractile cells grown on laminin and type IV collagen (27Zheng B. Duan C. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8994-9000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Likewise, the biosynthesis and secretion of IGFBP-5 by porcine VSMCs decreased by 18-fold when cell density increases from 30 to 100% confluence, whereas the concentrations of IGFBP-4 increased up to 15-fold (6Duan C. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16836-16842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because different IGFBPs have different biological effects (14Baxter R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E967-E976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 800-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and because the availability of IGFBPs is differentially regulated by the cellular context, we hypothesized that locally produced IGFBPs may be important in determining specific responses to the IGF signal. The goals of this study were to determine whether IGFBPs regulate the chemotactic and mitogenic responses of VSMCs to IGF stimulation, and to elucidate the individual role(s) and underlying mechanisms of local IGFBPs in regulating VSMC migration and proliferation. Materials—All chemicals and reagents were purchased from Fisher unless noted otherwise. The neutralizing IGF-I antibody (Sm1.2) was a gift from Dr. Judson VanWyk at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The rainbow molecular weight marker and [3H]thymidine were obtained from ICN Biomedicals Inc. (Irvine, CA). Human IGF-I, des-1–3-IGF-I, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-4 were purchased from GroPep (Adelaide, Australia). Recombinant human IGFBP-5 was purchased from IBT-Immunological and Biochemical Testsystems GmbH (Reutlingen, Germany). The non-IGF-binding human IGFBP-5 mutant and heparin-binding deficient human IGFBP-5 mutant (K202A/R206N/R207A) were prepared as described previously (28Imai Y. Moralez A. Andag U. Clarke J.B.

Chondroitinase, heparin, and various chondroitin sulfates were purchased from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum (FBS), Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM), penicillin/streptomycin, and trypsin were purchased from Invitrogen. Cell Culture and Transfection—Porcine VSMCs were isolated from thoracic aorta of 3-week-old piglets (22Duan C. Hawes S.B. Prevette T. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 4280-4288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in 10-cm dishes (Falcon, BD Biosciences) in DMEM supplemented with glutamine (4 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% FBS. The medium was changed every 4th day until the cells became confluent. Before stimulation experiments, medium was changed to serum-free DMEM (SFM) for 20–24 h. This SFM was then replaced with fresh SFM plus the indicated growth factors for various times. Cultured porcine VSMCs were transfected with the pMEP4/IGFBP-5 construct or empty pMEP4 following a procedure published previously (30Parker A. Rees C. Clarke J. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2383-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were trypsinized, plated on three 10-cm plates, and grown in DMEM plus 10% FBS with 120 μg/ml hygromycin B. Medium was analyzed for secretion of IGFBP-5 as described below. Western Immunoblot, Immunoprecipitation, and Ligand Blot Analysis—In order to identify the forms of IGFBPs secreted by VSMCs, conditioned media were concentrated 20 times through a Centricon-10 microconcentrator (Amicon) by centrifugation (22Duan C. Hawes S.B. Prevette T. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 4280-4288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, and they were transferred to filters (Immobilon P, 0.45-μm pore size, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and subjected to immunoblot and ligand blot analysis following standard procedures (6Duan C. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16836-16842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Biological Assays—The effects of IGF-I and/or IGFBPs on VSMC DNA synthesis and growth was examined by direct cell counting, [3H]thymidine incorporation, and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling assays as reported previously (8Duan C. Bauchat J.R. Hsieh T. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The effects of IGF-I, IGFBPs, and selected soluble glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on VSMC migration were investigated using the trans-well migration assay and gold particle cell motility assay. The trans-well migration assay measures the directional movements of VSMCs across a porous membrane, as described previously (8Duan C. Bauchat J.R. Hsieh T. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The gold particle cell motility assay measures cell motility in the absence of a concentration gradient (31Alberch-Buehler G. Cell. 1977; 11: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 32Cheng H.-L. Steinway M. Russell J.W. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27197-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a uniform carpet of gold particles was prepared on BSA-coated glass coverslips placed in 6-well plates. Colloidal gold-coated coverslips were rinsed and then seeded with 1 × 104 VSMCs in 2 ml of DMEM or DMEM + 100 ng/ml IGF-I. After 6 h, cells were fixed with 3.5% glutaraldehyde, air-dried, and mounted on glass slides. The gold particle-free clear zone surrounding the cells was photographed, and VSMC motility was represented as the average area of at least 60 pericellular clear zones, quantitated using Scion Image software (Frederick, MD). Removal of Cell-surface GAGs by GAG Lyase Treatment—Enzymatic treatment with GAG lyases was performed following published methods (33Tyagi M. Rusnati M. Presta M. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3254-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Briefly, VSMCs cells were incubated with the GAG lyases in 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% BSA, 0.2% gelatin, and 0.1% glucose for 40 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Cells were then washed 3 times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, washed again with SFM, and used for migration assays. Statistical Analysis—Values are means ± S.E. Differences among groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Fisher's protected least significance difference test using StatView (Abacus Concept, Berkeley, CA). Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. The Local Repertoire of IGFBPs Is Critical in Determining Whether VSMCs Migrate or Proliferate in Response to IGF-I Stimulation—To test the hypothesis that the local repertoire of IGFBPs may affect the cellular responses to IGF-I stimulation, we examined the effects of IGF-I and des-1–3-IGF-I on VSMC growth and migration. Des-1–3-IGF-I is an IGF-I analog that binds to IGF-IR with normal affinity but has greatly reduced affinity for IGFBPs (34Francis G.L. Ross M. Ballard F.J. Milner S.J. Senn C. McNeil K.A. Wallace J.C. King R. Wells J.R.E. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 8: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, both IGF-I and des-1–3-IGF-I stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in a dose-dependent fashion. Compared with IGF-I, however, des-1–3-IGF-I was more potent at concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 ng/ml. At 10 ng/ml, des-1–3-IGF-I and IGF-I induced a 362.6 ± 10 and a 221.3 ± 15.7% increase over the control, respectively. The difference between these two groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05, n = 4). Similarly, 20 ng/ml of des-1–3-IGF-I caused a 444.2 ± 37.7% increase which is significantly higher than the 304.7 ± 31.4% increase induced by IGF-I at the same concentration (p < 0.05, n = 4). When the peptide concentration was increased to 50 ng/ml and higher, the difference between the two peptides disappeared, indicating saturation of endogenous IGFBPs by excess IGF-I added. When the chemotactic activities of IGF-I and des-1–3-IGF-I were examined, an opposite relationship was observed, i.e. IGF-I was a much stronger chemoattractant (Fig. 1B). At 20 ng/ml, IGF-I caused 833 ± 182% increase over the control group (p < 0.01, n = 3), whereas des-1–3-IGF-I only caused a 450 ± 113% increase over the control group (p < 0.05, n = 3). The difference between the IGF-I and des-1–3-IGF-I groups at this concentration was also statistically significant (p < 0.05). At 50 ng/ml, des-1–3-IGF-I induced migration was 441.7 ± 71.2%. This value was significantly lower than that of the IGF-I group (1183 ± 176.4%, p < 0.01). Similarly, IGF-I at a higher concentration (100 ng/ml) caused a significantly greater increase in VSMC migration than that of des-1–3-IGF-I (1216.7 ± 154.3% versus 208.3 ± 109.3%, p < 0.05). These data suggest that the endogenous IGFBPs strongly promote VSMC migration toward IGF-I, but they inhibit IGF-I-induced DNA synthesis. The distinct dose-response curves of IGF-I and des-1–3-IGF-I on cell migration are also suggestive of different mechanisms underlying their actions. Different IGFBPs Exhibit Different Biological Effects in Regulating Mitogenic and Chemotactic Actions of IGF-I—Cultured porcine VSMCs synthesize and secrete IGFBP-2, IGFBP-4, and IGFBP-5 (22Duan C. Hawes S.B. Prevette T. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 4280-4288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To determine the individual effects of these IGFBPs, we tested the ability of each IGFBP to modulate the mitogenic and chemotactic actions of IGF-I. IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4, when added together with IGF-I at an equal molar concentration, significantly inhibited IGF-I-stimulated BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 2A). Neither IGFBP-2 nor IGFBP-4 alone caused any significant change. In migration assays, IGF-I (50 ng/ml) alone induced a 642 ± 181% increase (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). The addition of IGFBP-2, at an equal molar concentration (200 ng/ml), reduced IGF-I-induced migration to 133 ± 28% of the control; this was significantly less than that observed in the IGF-I alone group (p < 0.01). IGFBP-4 (150 ng/ml) had a similar, but more modest, inhibitory effect; it caused a 52% reduction in IGF-I-induced migration (p < 0.05). When either IGFBP-2 or IGFBP-4 was added in the absence of IGF-I, no significant change was observed (Fig. 2B). When added with IGF-I, IGFBP-5 caused a statistically insignificant 21% increase in IGF-I-induced DNA synthesis (Fig. 2A). In contrast, addition of IGFBP-5 together with IGF-I at the same concentrations resulted in a 1393 ± 372% increase in directed migration toward IGF-I (Fig. 2B). This value was significantly higher than that of the IGF-I alone group (642 ± 181%, p < 0.05). Intriguingly, addition of IGFBP-5 alone resulted in a statistically significant increase as compared with the control group (216 ± 32%, p < 0.05). IGFBP-5 alone had no effect on DNA synthesis in these cells. To examine further the effect of IGFBP-5, cells were subjected to different concentrations of IGFBP-5 in the presence and absence of IGF-I (20 ng/ml). As shown in Fig. 2C, addition of IGFBP-5 stimulated VSMC migration in a dose-dependent fashion with or without IGF-I. These results suggest that IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4 act as inhibitors of IGF-I actions, whereas IGFBP-5 potentiates IGF-induced VSMC migration. The data also suggest that IGFBP-5 may alter the VSMC motility by itself. Expression of IGFBP-5 in VSMCs Increases the Basal and the IGF-I Induced Cell Migration but Decreases Cell Growth— Earlier studies showed that porcine VSMCs secrete a protease that specifically degrades IGFBP-5, but this protease does not cleave IGFBP-2 or IGFBP-4 (22Duan C. Hawes S.B. Prevette T. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 4280-4288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 35Busby Jr., W.H. Nam T.-J. Moralez A. Smith C. Jennings M. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37638-37644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The presence of this potent IGFBP-5 protease complicates the interpretation of the data obtained with the use of exogenous IGFBP-5. To define further the role of IGFBP-5, porcine VSMCs were transfected with an IGFBP-5 expression construct, and three independent groups of cells that stably expressed the transgene (+BP5) were obtained. The three +BP5 clones secreted considerably more IGFBP-5 (250, 345, and 180% compared with the wild-type control (WT), respectively). The empty expression vector (Mock)-transfected cells had low levels of IGFBP-5, comparable with those of WT. No significant variation in the IGFBP-2 levels was detected among +BP5, Mock, and WT cells (data not shown). The growth curves of three independent clones of Mock cells were similar to that of WT (Fig. 3A). In contrast, all three +BP5 clones had significantly reduced growth rate when compared with WT and Mock throughout the period. The difference was highly significant at 288 h (p < 0.01). Next, the IGF-I-induced DNA synthesis in these cells was examined by [3H]thymidine incorporation assays. As shown in Fig. 3B, IGF-I stimulated DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner in all groups. However, the basal levels of [3H]thymidine incorporation in the +BP5 clones were only 26 ± 7% of those observed in WT and Mock cells, and the level remained significantly lower even in the presence of increasing concentrations of IGF-I. Together, these data indicate that overexpression of IGFBP-5 inhibits IGF-I-stimulated porcine VSMC growth. The effect of IGFBP-5 expression on cell migration is shown in Fig. 4. In the absence of IGF-I, Mock-transfected cells were similar to the WT group in the basal migration rate (4.8 ± 0.2 versus 3.7 ± 1.2 cells/well). IGF-I caused a similar degree of chemotactic response in the WT and Mock cells (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the +BP-5 cells showed significantly higher levels of migration at all the concentrations of IGF-I tested (p < 0.01). Even in the absence of IGF-I, these cells showed an 8-fold increase over the WT control (29.6 versus 3.7 cells/well, p < 0.01, n = 3). Closer observation of the response curves revealed that IGFBP-5 overexpression caused a left shift in the dose-response curve to IGF-I. The maximum response was detected at 5 ng/ml of IGF-I in the +BP5 cells, which is much lower than the maximal response concentrations seen in WT and Mock cells (50 ng/ml), suggesting that IGFBP-5 enhances the cellular responsiveness to the IGF-I stimulation. To examine further the effect of IGFBP-5, cells from +BP5, Mock, and WT groups were analyzed using the gold particle cell motility assay. As shown in Fig. 4B, WT and Mock cells showed a similar degree of motility. The +BP5 clones showed a mean increase of 264 ± 52% compared with WT cells. To determine whether the effect of IGFBP-5 on basal cell motility was IGF-dependent, an IGF-I-neutralizing antibody (Sm1.2) was added. This antibody has been shown to neutralize IGF-I actions in porcine VSMCs (6Duan C. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16836-16842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Addition of Sm1.2 did not cause any significant change in basal or IGFBP-5-induced motility. These results suggest that overexpression of IGFBP-5 in VSMCs not only potentiates IGF-I-induced chemotaxis but also stimulates basal cell motility rate through a ligand-independent mechanism(s). IGFBP-5 Stimulates VSMC Migration via an IGF-independent Mechanism—Further evidence for IGF-independent action of IGFBP-5 came from the check board analysis. IGF-I is a chemoattractant for VSMCs. It stimulated VSMC migration when added to the lower chamber (Fig. 5A). When the IGF-I concentration gradient was eliminated by adding the same concentration of IGF-I to both lower and upper chambers, it did not stimulate VSMCs migration. In contrast, addition of IGFBP-5 to both chambers resulted in an increase that was comparable with that in the lower chamber alone (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the effect of IGFBP-5 on VSMC migration is not chemotactic. Because it is known that cultured porcine VSMCs synthesize and secrete IGF-I (6Duan C. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16836-16842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), it is possible that the exogenously added IGFBP-5 influences VSMC migration by interacting with the endogenous IGF-I. To clarify this issue, migration assays were performed in the presence and absence of the IGF-I-neutralizing antibody (Sm1.2). As shown in Fig. 5B, Sm1.2 completely abolished the chemotactic action of IGF-I (50 ng/ml) without affecting the level of basal migration. The addition of Sm1.2, however, did not change the higher basal migration rate of the IGFBP-5 group. To ascertain that the action of IGFBP-5 is independent from its IGF binding, we next examined the activity of a non-IGF binding IGFBP-5 mutant. This mutant has a 1000-fold reduced affinity for IGF-I (28Imai Y. Moralez A. Andag U. Clarke J.B. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and has been used to determine IGF-I-independent effects of IGFBP-5 on cellular physiologic processes in cell types that secrete IGF-I (36Perks C.M. McCaig C. Clarke J.B. Clemmons D.R. Holly J.M.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5C, wild-type IGFBP-5 and the non-IGF-binding IGFBP-5 mutant both caused a significant increase. The mutant caused a 565% increase (32.7 ± 4.1 versus 5.8 ± 1.4 cells/well, p < 0.01 compared with the BSA control). This value was even higher than that of the wild-type IGFBP-5 group (21.8 ± 3.9 cells/well, a 376% increase over the BSA control) although the difference was not statistically significant. Taken together, these data indicate that IGFBP-5 stimulates VSMC migration through an IGF-I-independent mechanism. IGFBP-5 Stimulates VSM Migration by Interacting with Cell-surface GAGs—Because IGFBP-5 binds to heparin and GAG-containing proteoglycans located on VSMC surface (29Arai T. Clarke J. Parker A.J. Busby W.H. Nam T.J. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6099-6106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 37Arai T. Parker A.J. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20388-20393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and because a peptide derived from the heparin-binding motif of IGFBP-5 has been shown to stimulate mesangial cell migration (38Abrass C.K. Berfield A.K. Andress D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F899-F906PubMed Google Scholar), we postulated that IGFBP-5 may regulate VSMC motility by interacting with GAGs containing proteoglycans on the cell surface. If this were correct, then one or more of the four groups of GAGs found on membrane-associated proteoglycans should act as competitive inhibitors of IGFBP-5 actions. We therefore tested the impact of the 4 major GAGs found on membranes, i.e. heparin/heparan sulfate (HS), chondroitin A, chondroitin B, and chondroitin C. Of the four GAGs, heparin at t"
https://openalex.org/W2068160448,"Acute myeloid leukemia 1 (AML1) belongs to a family of DNA-binding proteins highly conserved through evolution. AML1 regulates the expression of several hematopoietic genes and is essential for murine fetal liver hematopoiesis. We report here that the histone methyltransferase SUV39H1, a mammalian ortholog of the Drosophila melanogaster SU(VAR) 3-9, forms complex with AML1. SUV39H1 methylates lysine 9 of the histone protein H3 leading to the formation of the high-affinity binding site on chromatin for proteins of the heterochromatin protein 1 family (HP1). The interaction of AML1 with SUV39H1 requires the N-terminus of AML1 where the Runt domain is located. Binding of AML1 to SUV39H1 abrogates the transactivating and DNA-binding properties of AML1 and dissociates the net-like nuclear structure of AML1. It has been reported that AML1 is capable of interaction with histone acetyl transferases (CBP, p300, and MOZ) and with component of the histone deacetylase complex (Sin3), and that the interaction with these coregulators affects the strength of AML1 in promoter regulation. Our data suggest that other enzymes are also involved in gene regulation by AML1 activity by modulating the affinity of AML1 for DNA."

Because telomerase activity is involved in estrogen-induced carcinogenesis, we examined the effect of raloxifene on estrogen-induced up-regulation of telomerase activity in MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line. Raloxifene inhibited the induction of cell growth and telomerase activity by 17β-estradiol (E2). Raloxifene inhibited the E2-induced expression of the human telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT), and transient expression assays using luciferase reporter plasmids containing various fragments of the hTERT promoter showed that the estrogen-responsive element appeared to be partially responsible for the action of raloxifene. E2 induced the phosphorylation of Akt, and pretreatment with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002, attenuated the E2-induced increases of the telomerase activity and hTERT promoter activity. Raloxifene inhibited the E2-induced Akt phosphorylation. In addition, raloxifene also inhibited the E2-induced hTERT expression via the PI3K/Akt/NFκB cascade. Moreover, raloxifene also inhibited the E2-induced phosphorylation of hTERT, association of NFκB with hTERT, and nuclear accumulation of hTERT. These results show that raloxifene inhibited the E2-induced up-regulation of telomerase activity not only by transcriptional regulation of hTERT via an estrogen-responsive element-dependent mechanism and the PI3K/Akt/NFκB cascade but also by post-translational regulation via phosphorylation of hTERT and association with NFκB.

However, the mechanism by which raloxifene acts to prevent breast cancer remains unclear.Telomerase is a cellular reverse transcriptase that catalyzes the synthesis and extension of telomeric DNA (13Greider C.W.

Thus, it is possible that estrogen enhances the transcription of hTERT via the PI3K/Akt/NFκB cascade.It was reported that the region surrounding Ser-824 in hTERT conforms to a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by Akt and that Akt kinase enhances human telomerase activity through phosphorylation of hTERT (21Kang S.S.

In addition, it was reported that an Akt cascade mediates the estrogen-induced S phase entry and cyclin D1 promoter activity in MCF-7 cells (22Castoria G. Migliaccio A. Bilancio A.

Thus, it is possible that estrogen enhances human telomerase activity through an Akt cascade. Another possible mechanism for post-translational modulation of telomerase activity is via the interaction of hTERT with accessory proteins. Recently, it was reported that 14-3-3 proteins (23Yang J.

In addition, we attempted to clarify the mechanism by which raloxifene inhibits the induction of telomerase activity by estrogen.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Raloxifene analog LY117018 was a kind gift from Eli Lilly Research Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). 17β-Estradiol, TPA, and rabbit IgG were purchased from Sigma.

The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate in the presence of 5% CO2 at 37 °C.Cell Proliferation Assay—The cells were plated at a density of 10 × 103 cells/well in 12-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. The cells were growth-arrested by phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% charcoal-stripped serum (CSS) for 48 h and were then treated with vehicle, E2, raloxifene, or E2 + raloxifene by exchanging the culture medium containing these agent(s) with fresh medium every 48 h for 8 days. A Neubauer chamber was used to count the cell number, and a trypan blue exclusion test was carried out to determine the cell viability. All of the experiments were carried out in quadruplicate. The values shown are the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments performed in quadruplicate at three different passages of the cell lines.Stretch PCR Assay—For quantitative analysis of telomerase activity, stretch PCR assays were performed using the Telochaser system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (18Kyo S. Takakura M. Kanaya T. Zhuo W. Fujimoto K. Nishio Y. Orimo A. Inoue M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5917-5921PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 7% polyacrylamide gel and visualized with SYBR green I nucleic acid gel stain (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME). To monitor the efficacy of PCR amplification, 10 ng of a internal control consisting of phage DNA (Toyobo) together with 50 pmol of specific primers (Toyobo) were added to the PCR mixture per reaction. Band intensity was measured using NIH Image software.RT-PCR Analysis—Total cellular RNA was isolated using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.). The expression of hTERT mRNA and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR amplification as described previously (18Kyo S. Takakura M. Kanaya T. Zhuo W. Fujimoto K. Nishio Y. Orimo A. Inoue M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5917-5921PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hTERT mRNAs were amplified using the primer pair 5′-CGGAAGAGTGTCTGGAGCAA-3′ and 5′-GGATGAAGCGGAGTCTGGA-3′. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using an RNA PCR kit version 2 (TaKaRa, Ohtsu, Japan) with random primers. Serially diluted cDNA reverse-transcribed from 1 μg of RNA was first amplified by RT-PCR to generate standard curves. The correlation between the band intensity and dose of cDNA template was linear under the conditions described below. Typically, 2-μl aliquots of the reverse-transcribed cDNA were amplified by 28 cycles of PCR in 50 μl of 1× buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm KCl) containing 1 mm each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa), and each specific primer at 0.2 μm. Each cycle consisted of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45s. PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel. The efficiency of cDNA synthesis from each sample was estimated by PCR with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific primers as described previously (18Kyo S. Takakura M. Kanaya T. Zhuo W. Fujimoto K. Nishio Y. Orimo A. Inoue M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5917-5921PubMed Google Scholar).Luciferase Assay—Plasmids pGL3–3328 and pGL3–2000 are hTERT promoter-luciferase reporters in which full-length or 5′-deleted promoters including a 77-bp 5′-untranslated region are cloned upstream of the luciferase gene in pGL3-Basic at MluI and BglII sites (18Kyo S. Takakura M. Kanaya T. Zhuo W. Fujimoto K. Nishio Y. Orimo A. Inoue M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5917-5921PubMed Google Scholar). pGL3-ERE-promoter was constructed by inserting head-in-tail tetramers of the ERE located at –2677 in the hTERT promoter, into the enhancer-less vector pGL3-promoter (18Kyo S. Takakura M. Kanaya T. Zhuo W. Fujimoto K. Nishio Y. Orimo A. Inoue M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5917-5921PubMed Google Scholar). pGL2-HPV31URR-luc vector is an HPV-31 enhancer and promoter-luciferase reporter containing the whole up-stream regulatory region (URR) of HPV-31 cloned upstream of the luciferase gene in pGL2-Basic (27Kyo S. Klumpp D.J. Inoue M. Kanaya T. Laimins L.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These reporter plasmids were transiently transfected into cells for 24 h using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were harvested and subjected to luciferase assays using a luciferase assay system (Promega) as described previously (18Kyo S. Takakura M. Kanaya T. Zhuo W. Fujimoto K. Nishio Y. Orimo A. Inoue M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5917-5921PubMed Google Scholar). A plasmid expressing the bacterial β-galactosidase gene was also cotransfected in each experiment to serve as an internal control for transfection efficiency.Western Blot Analysis—The cells were incubated in phenol red-free medium without serum for 16 h and then treated with various agents. They were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold HNTG buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 100 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (28Mabuchi S.

The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and the protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blocking was done in 10% bovine serum albumin in 1× Tris-buffered saline. Western blot analyses were performed with various specific primary antibodies. For detection of phosphorylated hTERT or association of hTERT with NFκB p65, cell lysates were prepared using HNTG buffer. The lysates were incubated with anti-hTERT antibody overnight and then immunoprecipitated for 2 h with protein A-Sepharose. Immune complexes were washed with ice-cold HNTG buffer, electrophoresed, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Akt substrate antibody or anti-NFκB p65 antibody. Immunoreacted bands in the immunoblots were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse immunoglobulin by using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting system.Fluorescence Microscopy—MCF-7 cells were grown on glass coverslips in six-well dishes. The cells were transfected with the pCR3-hTERT plasmid for 24 h and then incubated with various reagents. The cells were fixed with 10% formalin for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Anti-HA antibody and Alexa Fluor secondary antibody were used at 2 μg/μl in blocking solution. The cells were counterstained with 10 mmol/liter Hoechst 33258 to visualize the nucleus. The samples were mounted on glass slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and the cells were examined using fluorescence microscopy. For quantification experiments, 100 cells were scored according to whether hTERT was higher in the nucleus (N), evenly distributed between nucleus and cytoplasm (N+C), or higher in the cytoplasm (C). The data represent the mean of three independent experiments.Statistics—Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test, and p < 0.01 was considered significant. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E.RESULTSRaloxifene Attenuates the E2-induced Up-regulation of Telomerase Activity and hTERT Expression—We first examined whether or not raloxifene regulates the proliferation of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells (Fig. 1A). E2 significantly induced cell growth at 10 nm. Although 10 nm raloxifene had no effect on the basal cell growth, it did significantly inhibit the E2-induced cell growth. To examine the effects of raloxifene on the estrogen-induced telomerase activity, MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were treated with 10 nm E2, 10 nm raloxifene, 10 nm E2 + 10 nm raloxifene, or 10 nm E2 + 1 μm ICI 182,780 (a highly selective ER antagonist) for 24 h (Fig. 1B). ICI 182,780 (positive control) attenuated the E2-induced telomerase activity (Fig. 1B, lane 5). Although raloxifene had no effect on basal telomerase activity (Fig. 1B, lane 3), it attenuated the E2-induced increase in telomerase activity (Fig. 1B, lane 4). Semiquantitative RT-PCR assays were performed to examine whether the attenuation of estrogen-induced telomerase activity by raloxifene was due to the attenuation by raloxifene of the estrogen-induced up-regulation of the expression of hTERT (Fig. 2A). As we previously reported (29Wang Z. Kyo S. Maida Y. Takakura M. Tanaka M. Yatabe N. Kanaya T. Nakamura M. Koike K. Hisamoto K. Ohmichi M. Inoue M. Oncogene. 2002; 22: 3517-3524Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), treatment of MCF-7 cells with 1 μm tamoxifen for 24 h attenuated the up-regulation of hTERT mRNA induced by 10 nm E2 (Fig. 2A, lane 5). Treatment of MCF-7 cells with 10 nm raloxifene for 24 h also attenuated the up-regulation of hTERT mRNA induced by 10 nm E2 (Fig. 2A, lane 6).Fig. 2Raloxifene attenuates the E2-induced hTERT expression. A, MCF-7 cells were treated with 10 nm E2 (lane 2), 1 μm tamoxifen (lane 3), 10 nm raloxifene (lane 4), 10 nm E2 + 1 μm tamoxifen (lane 5), or 10 nm E2 + 10 nm raloxifene (lane 6). Twenty-four hours later, RNA was extracted, and RT-PCR assays were performed to detect hTERT mRNA. TAM, tamoxifen; RAL, raloxifene; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. A representative example of an experiment that was repeated three times is shown. B, MCF-7 cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids containing full-length (–3328) or 5′-deleted hTERT promoter (–2000) and treated with 10 nm E2 (lane 2), 10 nm raloxifene (lane 3), 10 nm E2 + 10 nm raloxifene (lane 4), 10 nm E2 + 1 μm ICI 182,780 (lane 5), or 10 nm E2 + 20 μm LY294002 (lane 6). Twenty-four hours later, the cells were collected, and luciferase assays were performed. The transcriptional activity of each reporter plasmid was normalized relative to β-galactosidase activity, and the activity in cells treated with vehicle was set at 1.0. The data are expressed as the mean fold activation ± S.E. of six transfections. C, MCF-7 cells were transfected with pGL3-ERE-promoter (pGL3-ERE-P) containing head-to-tail tetramers of ERE in the hTERT promoter or enhancer-less pGL3-promoter, and treated with 10 nm E2 (lane 2), 10 nm raloxifene (lane 3), 10 nm E2 + 10 nm raloxifene (lane 4), or 10 nm E2 + 1 μm ICI 182,780 (lane 5). Twenty-four hours later, the cell pellets were collected, and the luciferase assays were performed. The transcriptional activity was normalized relative to β-galactosidase activity, and the activity in cells treated with vehicle was set at 1.0. The data are expressed as the mean fold activation ± S.E. of six transfections. D, MCF-7 cells were transfected with 5′-deleted hTERT promoter (–2000) and treated with phenol red-free medium without serum (Serum free, lane 1), or with 10% CSS (lane 2), or 10% CSS + 10 nm raloxifene (lane 3). Twelve hours later, the cell pellets were collected, and the luciferase assays were performed. The transcriptional activity was normalized relative to β-galactosidase activity, and the activity in cells treated without serum was set at 1.0. The data are expressed as the mean fold activation ± S.E. of six transfections. E, MCF-7 cells were transfected with HPV31URR-luc and treated with 10 nm raloxifene (lane 2), 100 nm TPA (lane 3), or 100 nm TPA + 10 nm raloxifene (lane 4). Twenty-four hours later, the cell pellets were collected, and the luciferase assays were performed. The transcriptional activity was normalized relative to β-galactosidase activity, and the activity in cells treated with vehicle was set at 1.0. The data are expressed as the mean fold activation ± S.E. of six transfections.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine the effect of raloxifene on the estrogen-induced transcriptional activity of the hTERT promoter, luciferase assays of cells into which hTERT-promoter reporter plasmids were transfected were performed (Fig. 2B). We have previously reported that an imperfect palindromic ERE is located at –2677 in the hTERT promoter and is capable of direct association with ER (18Kyo S. Takakura M. Kanaya T. Zhuo W. Fujimoto K. Nishio Y. Orimo A. Inoue M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5917-5921PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter plasmids containing the full-length hTERT 5′ regulatory region (pGL3–3328) or a deletion mutant lacking the imperfect palindromic ERE (pGL3–2000) were transfected into MCF-7 cells. ICI 182,780 attenuated the E2-induced transcriptional activation of pGL3–3328 (Fig. 2B, lane 5). Raloxifene also attenuated the E2-induced transcriptional activation of pGL3–3328 (Fig. 2B, lane 4). To examine whether the ERE at –2677 is involved in the E2-induced up-regulation of the hTERT promoter activity and the inhibitory effect of raloxifene, this putative ERE was cloned upstream of the SV40 promoter in a luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3-ERE-promoter) and used for transfection. Although E2 had no effect on transcriptional activation of enhancer-less pGL3-promoter containing only SV40 promoter (data not shown), E2 treatment caused transcriptional activation of pGL3-ERE-promoter (Fig. 2C, lane 2), as we reported previously (28Mabuchi S. Ohmichi M. Kimura A. Hisamoto K. Hayakawa J. Nishio Y. Adachi K. Takahashi K. Arimoto-Ishida E. Nakatsuji Y. Tasaka K. Murata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33490-33500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Treatment with raloxifene (Fig. 2C, lane 4) or ICI 182,780 (Fig. 2C, lane 5) attenuated the E2-induced transcriptional activation of the pGL3-ERE-promoter. E2 did activate the transcriptional activity of pGL3–2000 to some extent (Fig. 2B, lane 2), and raloxifene (Fig. 2B, lane 4) or ICI (Fig. 2B, lane 5) attenuated the E2-induced transcriptional activation of pGL3–2000. These results suggest that the ERE at –2677 is partially responsible for the E2-induced activation of the hTERT promoter and the inhibitory effect of raloxifene.We examined whether raloxifene has a general inhibitory effect on transcription. Raloxifene did not have an inhibitory effect on 10% CSS-induced hTERT promoter activity using a deletion mutant of the imperfect palindromic ERE (pGL3–2000) (Fig. 2D). In addition, we used HPV31URR-luc, which is a well characterized reporter for examining the AP-1 activity (27Kyo S. Klumpp D.J. Inoue M. Kanaya T. Laimins L.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Raloxifene did not have an inhibitory effect on TPA-induced HPV31 promoter activity (Fig. 2E). These results suggest that raloxifene does not have an inhibitory effect on the induction of AP-1 or SRE activity in promoter"

In this study, we have shown for the first time that sperm gangliosides are ligands for the intact glycosylated SBP. Using recombinant fragments of the SBP, the N-terminal heat shock protein 110-like domain was shown to be responsible for the binding. The intact SBP could bind various gangliosides, and the binding was sialidase-sensitive and inhibited by sialyllactose, thus indicating that it is the sialic acid-binding protein. Calcium and magnesium ions were not required but they did enhance the binding activity of SBP. The observation that bacterially expressed recombinant SBP and the sialidase-treated intact glycosylated SBP lost divalent cation-dependent enhancement of binding activity suggests that the sialylated carbohydrate moieties of the SBP may be involved in this property. Furthermore, the SBP was shown to bind sperm lipid rafts, in which gangliosides are enriched, and this binding was lost upon sialidase treatment of the lipid rafts. Finally, liposomes containing the ganglioside specifically inhibited fertilization. Taken together, these results allow us to identify SBP as a member of a new class of sialic acid-binding lectin belonging to the Hsp110 family, and indicate that SBP may be involved in interaction of sperm with the vitelline layer of the egg.

Kitajima K. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that two different anti-sperm ganglioside antibodies specifically inhibit sea urchin fertilization. 2E. Maehashi, K. Ohta, C. Sato, N. Hirohashi, M. Toriyama, and K. Kitajima, manuscript in preparation.2E. Maehashi, K. Ohta, C. Sato, N. Hirohashi, M. Toriyama, and K. Kitajima, manuscript in preparation. These results strongly suggest that sperm gangliosides participate in the sperm-egg interaction in sea urchin. However, despite the suggested importance of the gangliosides, a ganglioside-binding protein has not been identified in sea urchin eggs. Therefore, we began searching for an egg component that can bind sperm gangliosides. In our efforts to do so, we have recently made a preliminary observation that the 350-kDa sperm-binding protein (SBP) could bind the major egg ganglioside (5Ohta K. Sato C. Matsuda T. Hirohashi N. Lennarz W.J. Kitajima K. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: S63Google Scholar). SBP was first identified and cloned as the species-specific binding molecule for sperm, and sperm can bind SBP after acrosome reaction (14Foltz K.R. Partin J.S. Lennarz W.J. Science. 1993; 259: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 15Ohlendieck K. Dhume S.T. Partin J.S. Lennarz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16Ohlendieck K. Partin J.S. Lennarz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 17Just M.L. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 184: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). SBP is a heavily glycosylated glycoprotein and is largely localized in the vitelline layer (18Hirohashi N. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), an egg extracellular matrix corresponding to the mammalian zona pellucida. SBP is known to be involved in interaction with sperm through interactions with the polypeptide itself as well as interactions with the acidic O-linked oligosaccharide chains (19Dhume S.T. Lennarz W.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Stears R.L. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Based on sperm binding experiments using recombinant fragments of SBP, two distinct sperm binding domains (SBD), a genus-specific and a genus-nonspecific SBD, were mapped on the glycoprotein (20Stears R.L. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The genus-specific SBD was shown to interact with bindin, an acrosome-derived protein that is exposed on the surface of acrosome-reacted sperm (21Cameron R.A. Walkup T.S. Rood K. Moore J.G. Davidson E.H. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, no binding counterpart on the sperm surface for the genus-nonspecific SBD has been so far identified. Interestingly, the genus-nonspecific SBD in SBP contains a homologous sequence (about 60% identity) to the heat shock protein (Hsp) 110 subfamily (14Foltz K.R. Partin J.S. Lennarz W.J. Science. 1993; 259: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 17Just M.L. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 184: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein for the genusnonspecific SBD (named GST 45A) has also been suggested to bind sulfated galactose (22Mamelak D. Mylvaganam M. Whetstone H. Hartmann E. Lennarz W.J. Wyrick P.B. Raulston J. Han H. Hoffman P. Lingwood C.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3572-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These results, together with our observation that the SBP binds the sperm gangliosides (5Ohta K. Sato C. Matsuda T. Hirohashi N. Lennarz W.J. Kitajima K. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: S63Google Scholar), suggest that SBP has the ability to bind either sulfated galactose-containing glycolipid or the gangliosides on sea urchin sperm through the genus-nonspecific SBD. In this study, we have characterized the binding properties of SBP to sperm gangliosides using both native and recombinant SBP. We have shown that SBP can bind sialic acid residues in gangliosides through the genus-nonspecific SBD and that sialylated carbohydrate moieties of the SBP are important for strong binding to the gangliosides that is enhanced in a divalent cation-dependent manner. There are several sialic acid-binding lectin families, such as the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (siglecs) and selectins. This study shows that SBP is a sialic acid binding lectin that belongs to the Hsp family, a Hsp-like lectin. Therefore, Hsp-like lectin can be regarded as a new member of the sialic acid-binding lectin families. We have also tested if the SBP binds sperm lipid rafts, because gangliosides are enriched in the lipid rafts (6Ohta K. Sato C. Matsuda T. Toriyama M. Lennarz W.J. Kitajima K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 616-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our results show that SBP binds lipid rafts through sialic acid residues. Finally, we have shown that liposomes containing sperm ganglioside specifically inhibit sea urchin fertilization. Thus, it is concluded that this sialic acid-mediated interaction is important in the sperm-egg binding at sea urchin fertilization.

This antibody recognizes a polypeptide part (amino acids 343-586) of theSBP, as determined using a series of the recombinant fragments as antigens. 2E. Maehashi, K. Ohta, C. Sato, N. Hirohashi, M. Toriyama, and K. Kitajima, manuscript in preparation. Anti-GST antibody (rabbit polyclonal IgG) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (Santa Cruz, CA). Peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies against rabbit IgG and mouse (IgG+IgM) were purchased from ICN/Cappel (Costa Mesa, CA) and American Qualex (San Clemente, CA), respectively. Preparation of the Low Density, Detergent-insoluble Membrane (LDDIM) Fraction—The LD-DIM) fraction from sperm (sperm LD-DIM) was prepared as described (6Ohta K. Sato C. Matsuda T. Toriyama M. Lennarz W.J. Kitajima K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 616-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, the amount of LD-DIM is expressed as the protein weight that is determined by the BCA assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Preparation of Liposomes—For preparation of liposome with or without the sperm ganglioside, phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and (Neu5Ac)2GlcCer(H) in a ratio of 7:4:3 (w/w/w) or phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol in a ratio of 7:3 (w/w) were dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). The mixtures were dried by rotary evaporator and subsequently in a desiccator under reduced pressure. Several glass beads and 5 ml of PBS were added and mixed. Vesicles of 100 nm in diameter were prepared by extruding these mixture through a filter (pore size, 100 nm) mounted in the extruder (Lipex Biomembranes, Vancouver, Canada) as described (24Okumura Y. Ishitobi M. Sobel M. Akiyoshi K. Sunamoto J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The diameters of liposomes with and without the ganglioside were both 100 nm, as measured by Dynamic Light Scattering Spectrophotometer Photal DLS-7000 (Hirakata, Japan). (a) Assay for Binding Activity of the SBP Binding of the SBP to Glycolipids—Binding activity of SBP was assayed based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Various glycolipids dissolved in ethanol at varying concentrations (50 μl) were added to the wells, incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and washed three times with PBS. Blocking was carried out by incubating the wells with 100 μl of 1% BSA/PBS at room temperature for 2 h. After washing three times with PBS and once with ASW or CMF-ASW, to the wells were added the SBP dissolved in ASW or CMF-ASW (1.8 μg/50 μl/well) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. After washing three times with ASW or CMF-ASW, the bound SBP was quantitated as follows. The wells were incubated with 50 μl of m35.9 of 1:500 dilution with 1% BSA/PBS at 4 °C for 12 h. After washing four times with PBST, the wells were incubated with 50 μl of the peroxidase-conjugated goat antibody against mouse (IgG+IgM) of 1:500 dilution with 1% BSA/PBS at room temperature for 2 h. After washing five times with PBST, color development was carried out by incubating with 100 μl of 0.05% o-phenylenediamine, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.006% H2O2, followed by addition of 100 μl of 1 m H2SO4. Absorbance at 492 nm was measured on Bio-Rad Microplate Reader Model 450. (b) Binding of SBP to the Sialidase-treated Sperm Gangliosides—The wells were coated with the ganglioside (Neu5Ac)2GlcCer at 250 ng of sialic acid/well, and blocked. After washing three times with PBS, the wells were incubated with or without a mixture of 2 milliunits/well each of A. ureafaciens and C. perfringens sialidases in 50 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) at room temperature for 3 h. After washing twice with ASW containing 0.1 mm Neu5Ac2en and twice with ASW, SBP was added and the binding was assayed as described in (a), except that m35.9 was used at 1:100 dilution. (c) Effect of Divalent Cations—After the glycolipid-coating and blocking, the wells were washed three times with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA, and the SBP that had been dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl containing CaCl2 (1, 5, or 10 mm), MgSO4 (1, 10, or 50 mm), or both 10 mm CaCl2 and 50 mm MgSO4 was added (50 μl, 150 ng/well). The SBP dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA was also added to the wells, and the binding was assayed as described in (a). (d) Binding of the Recombinant Fragments of SBP to Glycolipids— The recombinant fragments of SBP (at indicated amounts in the figures) was used instead of SBP. Incubation with a GST fusion protein (GST-hyosophorin) that was kindly provided by Mr. J. Taniguchi in our laboratory (Nagoya University) was also run as a negative control. The bound recombinant SBP was also quantitated as described in (a) except that rabbit anti-GST antibody (1:1500 dilution) and the peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000 dilution) were used instead of m35.9 and the peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (IgG+IgM), respectively. (e) Binding of the Sialidase-treated SBP to the Sperm Ganglioside— SBP (270 μg) was incubated with a mixture of 0.125 unit each of A. ureafaciens and C. perfringens sialidases in 640 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) at 25 °C for 3 h. The digest was ultrafiltered through Microcon YM-10. To the concentrated SBP, 500 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) were added, followed by the ultrafiltration again. The resultant SBP was used for the ELISA-based binding assay after diluting with ASW or CMF-ASW. The combined filtrates were analyzed for the presence of released sialic acid by the fluorometric analysis (25Hara S. Yamaguchi M. Takemori Y. Nakamura M. Ohkura Y. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 377: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 26Sato C. Inoue S. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For quantitating content of sialic acid, the SBP (1.9 μg) was hydrolyzed in 0.1 n trifluoroacetic acid at 80 °C for 2 h, and the released sialic acid was fluorometrically quantitated. The sialidase activity was assayed as described (27Fuchizawa S. Furuhata K. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). For binding assay, coating, and blocking of the wells were described in (a). To the coated wells, 5.5 μl of 1 mm Neu5Ac2en or water and 50 μl of the SBP or the sialidase-treated SBP in ASW or CMF-ASW (1.8 μg/50 μl/well) were added and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The bound SBP or sialidase-treated SBP was quantitated as described in (a). (f) Binding of the SBP to the Sperm LD-DIM and the Sialidase-treated One—The wells were coated with 50 μl of the sperm LD-DIM (0-400 ng/well) in PBS at room temperature for 2 h. For sialidase treatment, the wells coated with the sperm LD-DIM at 200 ng of sialic acid/well were incubated with or without a mixture of 0-2 milliunits/well each of A. ureafaciens and C. perfringens sialidases in 50 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) at room temperature for 3 h. After washing twice with ASW containing 0.1 mm Neu5Ac2en and twice with ASW, blocking and other procedures were done as described in (a). Inhibition of the SBP Binding to (Neu5Ac) 2 GlcCer by Sialyllactose— Inhibition experiment of SBP binding to the ganglioside by sialyllactose was based on inhibition ELISA procedures as follows. The wells were coated with (Neu5Ac)2GlcCer at 250 ng of sialic acid/well and blocked. After washing three times with PBS and once with ASW, SBP (1.8 μg/50 μl) that had been mixed with 0-1 mm sialyllactose in ASW for 5 min was added to the wells and incubated at 4 °C for overnight. The bound SBP was quantitated as described in (a) of the above section. Fertilization Experiments—Unfertilized eggs were washed several times with ASW and dejellied by passing through 70-μm mesh 10 times. The extent of dejellying was checked by observing the distance between eggs under the microscope (18Hirohashi N. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Dry sperm were diluted 50-fold into ASW (pH 8.0), and stored on ice within 3 h. Prior to use, sperm motility and the ability of sperm to aggregate with jelly were checked (18Hirohashi N. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The sperm suspension was adjusted at appropriate density with ASW (pH 8.0) and a 10-μl aliquot was added to 100 μl of about 10% (v/v) egg suspension that had been kept at 14 °C, and incubated at 14 °C for 10 min. More than 200 eggs were observed under the microscope, and the number of eggs whose fertilization envelopes were elevated was counted as fertilized eggs. Two independent experiments were carried out. For testing effects of the liposome with or without the ganglioside on fertilization, 90 μl of the egg suspension (10% v/v) was pre-incubated with each liposome at 0-50 ng/ml at 14 °C for 30 min. Then, a 10-μl aliquot of the sperm suspension was added to the egg suspension. SBP binds sperm gangliosides. It was previously shown that acrosome-reacted sperm binds to SBP of sea urchin eggs (15Ohlendieck K. Dhume S.T. Partin J.S. Lennarz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16Ohlendieck K. Partin J.S. Lennarz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28Ohlendieck K. Partin J.S. Stears R.L. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Since SBP is mainly localized in the vitelline layer (18Hirohashi N. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), sperm surface gangliosides could interact with it during sperm penetration of the vitelline layer. In a search for molecules that could bind to sperm gangliosides, we found that SBP from S. purpuratus eggs could bind the sperm ganglioside, (Neu5Ac)2GlcCer (5Ohta K. Sato C. Matsuda T. Hirohashi N. Lennarz W.J. Kitajima K. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: S63Google Scholar). Following this finding, we have now further characterized binding activity of the SBP to sperm gangliosides. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, SBP bound not only (Neu5Ac)2GlcCer but also Neu5AcGlcCer, in a concentration-dependent manner. (Neu5Ac)2GlcCer is a major ganglioside and Neu5AcGlcCer is a minor ganglioside (13Ijuin T. Kitajima K. Yu S. Kitazume S. Inoue S. Haslam S.M. Morris H.R. Dell A. Inoue Y. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results indicate that SBP has the ability to bind sea urchin sperm gangliosides. When (Neu5Ac)2GlcCer was pretreated with sialidase, no binding was observed (Fig. 1C). Moreover, the binding of SBP to (Neu5Ac)2GlcCer was inhibited by co-incubation with sialyllactose in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). At 1 mm of sialyllactose, the binding was inhibited by 21%. These results clearly indicate that the sialic acid residue is necessary for SBP binding. Binding of SBP to sperm gangliosides was observed in the absence of Ca2+ and Mg2+, showing that the binding does not require divalent cations. However, greater binding was observed in the presence of divalent cations than in their absence (Fig. 1, A and B), indicating that divalent cations enhance the binding activity of SBP. SBP was also shown to be present in H. pulcherrimus eggs, 2E. Maehashi, K. Ohta, C. Sato, N. Hirohashi, M. Toriyama, and K. Kitajima, manuscript in preparation. and similar binding ability to the sperm gangliosides was observed (data not shown). Binding Properties of SBP to Various Gangliosides—To gain further insight into the binding properties of SBP, various glycolipids were tested as ligands. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, SBP had the ability to bind gangliosides GM3, GM1, GD3, and GD1a, which do not exist in sea urchin sperm. No binding to GlcCer or LacCer was observed. These results indicate that SBP recognizes sialic acid residues of the gangliosides. GD1a was a poor ligand for the SBP, compared with other gangliosides. This result suggests that not only sialic acid residues themselves, but also the underlying structures appear to affect SBP binding. The SBP also bound sulfatide, but this binding was not strong relative to other gangliosides. These results suggest that SBP recognizes sialic acid rather than sulfate residues in these acidic glycolipids. The results confirming that GD1a and sulfatide were poorer ligands than GM3, GM1, or GD3 were highly reproducible. However, quanitative evaluation of binding strength of SBP to gangliosides by static and kinetic analyses are necessary for better understanding of the binding specificity of SBP. Binding of SBP to GM3 was also observed in the absence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ and enhanced by the presence of these cations (Fig. 2A), as was observed for the sperm gangliosides (Fig. 1, A and B). Effects of Divalent Cations on Binding of Gangliosides by SBP—Effects of divalent cations on binding of gangliosides to SBP were examined using the sperm ganglioside, (Neu5Ac)2GlcCer (Fig. 3). In these experiments, ranges of Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations were 0-10 mm and 0-50 mm, respectively, similar to concentration ranges occurring in sea water where fertilization occurs. SBP was shown to bind ganglioside in the absence of Mg2+ and Ca2+ When either Ca2+ or Mg2+ alone was added to the incubation solution, binding activity of the SBP to the ganglioside was dose-dependently enhanced. Ca2+ was more effective than Mg2+. These results indicate that the binding activity of SBP to ganglioside does not require divalent cations, although it is effectively enhanced by Ca2+. Binding Properties of Recombinant Fragments of SBP to Various Glycolipids—It was previously shown that SBP contains two sperm binding domains (SBD), the genus-nonspecific SBD (amino acids 96-342), and the genus-specific SBD (amino acids 380-411), respectively (20Stears R.L. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested which SBD is responsible for binding to the sperm ganglioside. The recombinant fragments, G-(96-586) containing both the genus-specific and genus-nonspecific SBDs, G-(96-342) corresponding to the genus-"

In bacteria, PriA is essential for restoration of stalled replication forks and recombinational repair of double-stranded DNA breaks and is a candidate sensor protein that may recognize arrested forks. Here, we report that PriA protein specifically recognizes 3′ termini of arrested nascent DNA chains at model stalled replication forks in vitro. Mutations in the putative “3′ terminus binding pocket” present in the N-terminal segment of PriA result in reduced binding to stalled replication fork structures and loss of its biological functions.

Progression of replication forks is stalled by a variety of internal and external causes, including DNA damage and depletion of precursors for DNA synthesis. The arrested replication forks elicit checkpoint responses that enable cells to repair damage, restore replication forks, and restart DNA replication (1Cox M.M. Goodman M.F. Kreuzer K.N.

The initial phase of this response is the recognition of the arrested forks by a sensor protein, which may be recruited to the site of the fork arrest and transduce various signals for further downstream cellular responses. However, the nature of the protein that detects the stalled replication forks and the mechanism by which they are recognized are still unclear. In Escherichia coli, PriA, a DEXH-type DNA helicase originally discovered as a protein essential for replication of a small single-stranded phage DNA, ϕX174, is believed to play a key role in rescuing the stalled replication forks (1Cox M.M.

A. 1991; 88: 3029-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 7Nurse P. Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6686-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Masai H. Asai T. Kubota Y.

These defects may reflect a critical role played by PriA in resumption of DNA replication after arrest of ongoing replication forks (11Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In E. coli, in fact, arrest of ongoing replication forks induces a recombination-dependent mode of DNA replication, known as inducible or constitutive stable DNA replication (iSDR 1The abbreviations used are: iSDR, inducible stable DNA replication; cSDR, constitutive stable DNA replication; A-fork, arrested fork; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence.1The abbreviations used are: iSDR, inducible stable DNA replication; cSDR, constitutive stable DNA replication; A-fork, arrested fork; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence. or cSDR, respectively), which requires PriA protein (8Masai H. Asai T. Kubota Y. Arai K. Kogoma T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5338-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It was shown that the ϕX174-type primosome could be assembled on a model D-loop structure in vitro (12Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25033-25041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 13Liu J. Xu L. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that PriA may recognize recombination intermediates generated as a result of fork arrest as well as the arrested replication fork per se and facilitate reassembly of replication forks (8Masai H. Asai T. Kubota Y. Arai K. Kogoma T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5338-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 14Jones J.M. Nakai H. Mol.

Cell. 2002; 9: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, PriA recognizes and binds specifically to DNA structures such as those mimicking D-loop (intermediates of homologous recombination reactions) or arrested replication forks (16McGlynn P. Al-Deib A.A. Liu J. Marians K.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 17Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, it has not been known what structural features of D-loop or arrested DNA replication fork structures are recognized by PriA. In this report, we show that PriA recognizes the 3′-end of DNA and have identified critical residues for this recognition within the N-terminal DNA binding domain. We propose the presence of a 3′ terminus binding pocket on PriA protein, which plays a critical role in detecting stalled replication forks. Purification of Protein Samples—Wild-type PriA-(1-181) and mutant PriA-(1-181) were expressed and purified as previously described (19Tanaka T. Mizukoshi T. Taniyama C. Kohda D. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38062-38071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PriA-(1-105) was prepared in the same manner as PriA-(1-181). The N-terminal histidine tag of these proteins was removed by thrombin treatment (1/100, w/w) for BIAcore and NMR analyses. Uniformly 15N-labeled PriA-(1-105) was prepared from E. coli cells carrying an expression plasmid grown in M9 minimal medium containing 1 g/liter of 15NH4Cl. Uniformly 15N,13C,2H-labeled PriA-(1-105) was prepared using M9 minimal medium containing 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl, 2.5 g/liter U-13C glucose in 99% 2H2O. To exchange the amide deuteriums to protons, the purified protein was denatured in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, followed by dialysis against a buffer solution (25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.5), 150 mm KCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol) for refolding. The protein was repurified by HT-heparin-agarose column (Amersham Biosciences). The level of deuterium incorporation for non-exchangable hydrogens was determined to be about 83% by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis. RecG protein was purified from a strain bearing pAF201, as described previously (20Fukuoh A. Iwasaki H. Ishioka K. Shinagawa H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). BIAcore Analyses of DNA Binding—The streptavidin (SA) sensor chips with less nonspecific interaction were prepared as follows. A CM5 sensor chip (BIACORE) was activated by N-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (NHS/EDC) solution for 40 min. SA (50 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.3)) was injected onto the activated CM5 surface. The remaining N-hydroxysuccinimide ester groups were inactivated by treatment in 1 m ethanolamine solution for another 40 min, and SA non-specifically adsorbed on the chip was removed by three 1-min washes in 50 mm NaOH and 1 m NaCl, resulting in reduced level of undesired free carboxyl groups. The HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20) was run at 37 °C at a flow rate of 8 μl/min for immobilization. A 17-mer oligonucleotide with/without terminal phosphate modification was immobilized on an SA-coated sensor chip via a biotin moiety attached on either its 5′- or 3′-end. See Fig. 1A for details. The amount of the immobilized oligonucleotide was adjusted to about 150 resonance unit (RU). HBS-EP buffer was used at a flow rate of 30 μl/min at 20 °C for measurement of protein binding. Regeneration of the sensor surface was achieved by three 5-s washes with 10 mm NaOH. The sensorgrams obtained were corrected by subtraction of those recorded by injection of the buffer alone. The dissociation constants were determined by a global fitting method using the BIAevaluation software 3.1 on the basis of the BIAcore experiments using the sensor chips prepared as above which show low nonspecific interactions. NMR Spectroscopy—The PriA-(1-105) was dissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 150 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% 2H2O (v/v). 1H-15N HSQC spectra were measured on a Bruker DMX600 spectrometer at 25 °C. For the assignment of cross-peaks, a series of three-dimensional spectra were recorded using 2H,15N,13C-labeled PriA-(1-105). Gel Shift Assays for DNA Binding of PriA and ATPase Assays—The D-loop and arrested fork-like substrates were prepared by annealing of oligonucleotides using oligonucleotides listed in the table (Table S1) of the Supplementary Materials, followed by isolation from polyacrylamide gel, as described previously (18Masai H. Deneke J. Furui Y. Tanaka T. Arai K. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The gel shift assays were conducted as described previously (19Tanaka T. Mizukoshi T. Taniyama C. Kohda D. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38062-38071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) except that the concentration of the salt (potassium glutatmate) was reduced to 40 mm in all the experiments other than Fig. 1B. ATPase assays were conducted as described previously (19Tanaka T. Mizukoshi T. Taniyama C. Kohda D. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38062-38071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), except that D-loop DNA was included as an effector DNA at 4 nm. E. coli Strains—AQ634 (priA +) and AQ8851 (priA1::kan) were previously described (8Masai H. Asai T. Kubota Y. Arai K. Kogoma T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5338-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). E. coli cells were maintained on LB, M9 containing casaamino acids (0.5%; M9-CAA), or M9 containing required amino acids (M9-AA). Transformation of plasmid DNA was conducted by the Inoue method (21Inoue H. Nojima H. Okayama H. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). SDR was measured as described before (8Masai H. Asai T. Kubota Y. Arai K. Kogoma T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5338-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 9Kogoma T. Cadwell G.W. Barnard K.G. Asai T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown via gel shift assays that the N-terminal 181 residue polypeptide of PriA can bind to a D-loop mimic DNA in vitro (19Tanaka T. Mizukoshi T. Taniyama C. Kohda D. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38062-38071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To determine the affinity of PriA and its truncated polypeptides with various forms of DNA, we developed a BIAcore assay system where the biotin-labeled substrate DNA was immobilized on a sensor chip through streptoavidin (Fig. 1A). The PriA N-terminal polypeptide exhibited binding not only to structured DNA mimicking D-loop (data not shown), but also to single-stranded oligonucleotide (17-mer) immobilized to a sensor chip through its 5′-end with K d = 4.9 μm. In contrast, the same oligonucleotide immobilized through its 3′-end did not serve as a ligand. This suggested a possibility that the 3′ terminus may play a crucial role in recognition of DNA by PriA protein. Therefore, we next generated an oligonucleotide whose 3′-end was phosphorylated and immobilized it on a sensor chip through its 5′-end (Fig. 1A). PriA interacted with this 3′-phosphorylated oligonucleotide only very weakly, supporting our hypothesis that a 3′ terminus is a critical determinant for DNA binding of PriA. The above results suggest a possibility that PriA recognizes the ends of non-elongated DNA chains resulting from arrested replication forks or recombination intermediates. To directly test this hypothesis, we conducted gel shift assays with structured DNA mimicking these structures. First, we generated a D-loop-like structure bearing either a 3′-invading or a 5′-invading strand at the fork and examined the binding of PriA by gel shift assays (16McGlynn P. Al-Deib A.A. Liu J. Marians K.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 19Tanaka T. Mizukoshi T. Taniyama C. Kohda D. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38062-38071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PriA bound to the 3′-invading substrate with much higher affinity (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lanes 1-6 and 13-18). PriA does not form a stable complex with a single-stranded oligonucleotide with a free 3′-end in gel shift assays, and therefore, the presence or absence of a free 3′-end of the invading strand in the 5′-invading D-loop does not affect the gel shift pattern (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lanes 13-18 and 19-24). We then generated a similar D-loop substrate with a 3′-invading strand whose 3′-end was phosphorylated. PriA formed rather smeared complexes on this substrate, and the K d was estimated to be more than one order of magnitude lower than that for the non-phosphorylated substrate (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lanes 7-12). DNA substrates more closely mimicking arrested fork-like structures were tested next. They were 105-nucleotide-long Y-fork structures carrying either a nascent leading strand or a nascent lagging strand or both at the fork (A-fork[3′], A-fork[5′], or A-fork[3′, 5′], respectively). PriA generated a specific complex in gel shift assays with A-fork[3′] or A-fork[3′, 5′] with high affinity (K d = ∼1.2 and ∼1.6 nm, respectively; Fig. 1C, lanes 1-5 and 16-20). It bound to A-fork[5′] with less affinity (with K d of 8 nm; Fig. 1C, lanes 11-15). Notably, when the 3′ terminus of the lagging strand was blocked by phosphorylation (A-fork[3′-P]), affinity was reduced to the level similar to that of A-fork[5′] (K d = ∼8 nm; Fig. 1C, lanes 6-10). Inhibitory effect of 3′-phosphorylation of the leading strand was further enhanced when shorter A-fork substrates (41 nucleotides long) were used (Fig. 1D; K d = ∼3 and ∼32 nm, respectively, for A-fork 41 [3′] and A-fork 41 [3′-P]). Furthermore, PriA bound to a 5′-extension structure with K d = 16 nm and phosphorylation of the 3′ terminus at the single-strand to double-strand junction reduced the affinity (Supplementary Fig. S1). These results indicate that the 3′ terminus of DNA present at the double-strand to single-strand junction is important for high affinity binding of PriA to fork structures and support our hypothesis that PriA protein specifically recognizes the 3′ terminus of the nascent leading strand at the fork, expected to be generated from arrest of replication fork progression. RecG has been implicated in the processing of stalled replication forks in collaboration with PriA (15Gregg A.V. McGlynn P. Jaktaji R.P. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 22McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8227-8234Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 23Singleton M.R. Scaife S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2001; 107: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). It is also a DEXH-type DNA helicase and is highly conserved in eubacteria (24Sharples G.J. Ingleston S.M. Lloyd R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5543-5550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RecG was shown to bind to structured DNAs including the Holliday junction and D-loop-like structures (16McGlynn P. Al-Deib A.A. Liu J. Marians K.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 25Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19729-19739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To examine whether the recognition of a 3′ terminus in an arrested fork-like structure is unique to PriA, we have purified RecG and examined its binding to the above substrates. RecG protein bound more efficiently to the 5′-invading D-loop (regardless of the presence or absence of 3′-phosphorylation) than to the 3′-invading D-loop (Fig. 1B, lower panel, lanes 1-6 and 13-24). Furthermore, it bound to the 3′-invading D-loop with a phosphorylated 3′-end as efficiently as that with a 3′-hydroxyl group (Fig. 1B, lower panel, lanes 7-12). Thus, specific recognition of a 3′ terminus appears to be unique to PriA. This is consistent with the absence of similarity in the N-terminal segments of PriA and RecG. Previous report on quantitative measurement of interaction of E. coli PriA protein with single-stranded DNA showed that this interaction is independent of DNA size from 8-mer to 24-mer (26Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27865-27873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which is expected if PriA primarily recognizes an end of DNA. We have further truncated the N-terminal 181 residue DNA binding segment and showed by BIAcore measurement that the N-terminal 105 residue segment (PriA-(1-105)) could bind to the 17-mer oligonucleotide in a manner dependent on the presence of a free 3′ terminus, although its binding affinity was lower than PriA-(1-181) (K d = 20 μm and data not shown), and D-loop binding could not be detected in gel shift assays. We then analyzed binding of PriA-(1-105) to an 8-mer oligonucleotide, carrying a free 3′-hydroxyl terminus or a phosphorylated 3′ terminus, by NMR. The 3′-hydroxyl DNA, but not the 3′-phosphorylated DNA, induced significant changes in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled PriA-(1-105) (Fig. 2A). In particular, we have identified Asp17, Tyr18, and Gly37 as residues whose cross-peaks disappeared during the titration due to the exchange broadening mechanism, indicative of the largest chemical shift changes. Comparison of PriA-related sequences in various bacteria indicated that these residues are among a set of well conserved residues present very near the N terminus (Fig. 2B). Particularly, FDY (16-18), GCRVRVPFG (29-37), and WAADYY (83-88) are well conserved. The conservation of the WAADYY motif was noted previously (19Tanaka T. Mizukoshi T. Taniyama C. Kohda D. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38062-38071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The selective effects of the 3′-free DNA on the subset of the cross-peaks suggest the specific recognition of the 3′-terminal end of single-stranded DNA by the N-terminal segment of the PriA protein through a defined binding pocket. The three amino acids identified are most likely candidate residues in this putative binding pocket. We mutagenized Phe36 and Gly37 (to alanine or leucine and alanine or asparagine, respectively) and purified the mutant N-terminal fragments (residue 1-181). Phe36 was also selected for mutagenesis, since it is a conserved aromatic residue that we predicted may interact with nucleotide bases through stacking. We could not obtain Asp17 and Tyr18 mutant polypeptides due to formation of inclusion bodies. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra indicated that the folding of the purified mutant proteins was maintained (data not shown). All the mutant polypeptides lost binding (F36A, G37A, and G37N) or showed reduced binding (F36L) to the 17-mer DNA in the BIAcore measurements (Fig. 2C). This result suggests that these residues constitute a part of a putative “3′ terminus binding pocket” of PriA protein. We then tried to generate full-length PriA carrying mutations in the putative 3′ terminus binding pocket. We constructed four mutants and purified two of them (F36G,V46G(#2) and L12G,F16G,Y18G(#4)). We have shown that, by gel filtration analyses, the purified wild-type as well as these mutant proteins exist as monomers and exhibit similar cleavage pattern upon partial tryptic digestion (data not shown), indicating that the overall structures are not altered by these mutations. They bound to D-loop and A-fork with affinity 2-3-fold lower than that of the wild type (Fig. 3A). We also examined ATPase activity of the mutant protein. PriA displays ATP hydrolysis activity in the presence of its target sequence such as n′-pas (primosome assembly site) or D-loop (27Tanaka T. Taniyama C. Arai K. Masai H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Consistent with low affinity of PriA to D-loop with a 3′-phosphorylated 3′-invading strand, PriA hydrolyzed ATP rather inefficiently in the presence of this effector DNA compared with the regular D-loop. In contrast, F36G,V46G(#2) and L12G,F16G,Y18G(#4) showed low ATPase activity even in the presence of a normal D-loop structure (Fig. 3B). This also indicates the importance of the 3′ terminus binding pocket for productive interaction of PriA with its target sequences. We propose that binding of PriA to arrested forks or related structures may be triggered by recognition of the 3′ terminus of the leading strand or invading strand of an arrested fork or D-loop, respectively, with its putative 3′ terminus binding pocket. This interaction, which is rather unstable in E. coli, will be further stabilized by the residues 106-181 (as indicated by the fact that PriA-(1-181), but not PriA-(1-105), is able to form a complex with D-loop in gel shift assays) and DNA helicase domain, which will make contact with other structures of arrested forks (19Tanaka T. Mizukoshi T. Taniyama C. Kohda D. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38062-38071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). More stable interaction with single-stranded DNA was reported for Bacillus subtilis PriA protein (28Polard P. Marsin S. McGovern S. Velten M. Wigley D.B. Ehrlich S.D. Bruand C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1593-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We expressed the mutant PriA proteins in the priA1::kan strain and examined their biological activities. The priA1::kan strain grows very slowly, exhibits low viability, and is sensitive to DNA damaging agents such as UV or γ-ray, and subsets of the cells are highly filamentous (6Lee E.H. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3029-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 7Nurse P. Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6686-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kogoma T. Cadwell G.W. Barnard K.G. Asai T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This strain is completely deficient in iSDR and cSDR (8Masai H. Asai T. Kubota Y. Arai K. Kogoma T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5338-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The wild-type PriA protein expressed from a miniR1-based vector, pHM6050, can completely correct these deficiencies. However, G29L,G37L,G44L(#1), R31A,V32A,V34A,P35A,F36A(#3), and L12G,F16G,Y18G(#4), expressed on the same vector, did not restore growth, morphology, and SDR (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S2). F36G,V46G(#2), which bound to an arrested fork structure with affinity about half the wild-type level, could restore most of these functions but restored iSDR to the level 70% of the wild type. The 3′ terminus binding pockets of these mutant proteins may interact with an end of DNA with different affinity and stability, which may not be obvious in gel shift assays using the full-length proteins carrying other DNA binding surfaces, and this may result in differential biological activities of these mutants. Sensitivity to UV of the priA null mutant was corrected by #2 mutant, but only partially by other mutants (data not shown). Residual resistance to UV with the pocket mutants may suggest that the forks arrested by UV could be recognized by these mutants to certain extent. We also showed that #1, #3, and #4 mutants could not rescue the extreme growth defect of priA1::kan gyrB(ts) double mutant (Ref. 29Grompone G. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar and data not shown), in agreement with an essential role of the 3′ terminus binding pocket of PriA in recovery of replication forks arrested during the course of DNA replication. Thus, proper and efficient recognition of the 3′ terminus of an arrested replication fork or that of the invading strand within D-loop by the PriA N-terminal segment is critical for various biological responses induced by unscheduled arrest of ongoing replication forks. Our results suggest that PriA specifically recognizes the replication forks with an arrested leading strand. When the lagging strand polymerase encounters a lesion, the leading strand synthesis may continue for a while in the absence of lagging strand synthesis. This sort of uncoupled leading strand synthesis was previously observed in plasmid DNA replication (30Staudenbauer W.L. Scherzinger E. Lanka E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 177: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It may be arrested due to constraint on the fork architecture, thus generating a non-elongated DNA end of the nascent leading strand. If double-stranded breaks are generated at the site of arrested forks, actions of recombination proteins would process them into recombination intermediates, which would also contain an end derived from the invading assimilated strand (15Gregg A.V. McGlynn P. Jaktaji R.P. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The ability of PriA to recognize the 3′ terminus of a hybridizing strand would be highly suitable for efficient and specific recognition of stalled replication forks, processed replication forks, or D-loop. Our results can explain the lack of binding of PriA to the Holliday junction or three-way junction structures which do not possess a 3′ terminus at the junction (16McGlynn P. Al-Deib A.A. Liu J. Marians K.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 17Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). They can also explain the increased helicase activity on the lagging strand arm by the presence of a leading strand fragment without a gap (15Gregg A.V. McGlynn P. Jaktaji R.P. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Monitoring the state of DNA replication is crucial for successful completion of DNA replication of the entire genome. The recognition of the stalled replication forks is the initial step for DNA damage or DNA replication checkpoint responses. It would be of interest if eukaryotic sensor proteins similarly recognize the end of DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2078954800,"The acrosome reaction (i.e. the exocytosis of the sperm vesicle) is a prerequisite for fertilization, but its molecular mechanism is largely unknown. We have identified a cDNA clone for a gene named haprin, which encodes a haploid germ cell-specific RING finger protein. This protein is a novel member of the RBCC (RING finger, B-box type zinc finger, and coiled-coil domain) motif family that has roles in several cellular processes, such as exocytosis. It is transcribed exclusively in testicular germ cells after meiotic division. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses showed the molecular weight of Haprin protein to be Mr approximately 82,000. It was localized in the acrosomal region of elongated spermatids and mature sperm and was not present in acrosome-reacted sperm. The specific antibody against the RING finger domain of Haprin inhibited the acrosome reaction in permeabilized sperm. These results indicated that the novel RBCC protein Haprin plays a key role in the acrosome reaction and fertilization."

Purification of either recombinant Bacillus megaterium or Synechocystis CbiXL in Escherichia coli, which is facilitated by the presence of a naturally occurring histidine-rich region of the protein, results in the isolation of a dark brown protein solution. The UV/visible spectrum of the protein is consistent with the presence of a redox group, and the lack of definition within the spectrum is suggestive of a 4Fe-4S center. The presence of an iron-sulfur center was confirmed by EPR analysis of the proteins, which produces a pseudoaxial spectrum with g values at 2.04, 1.94, and 1.90. The EPR spectrum was absent at 70 K, an observation that is diagnostic of a 4Fe-4S center. Redox potentiometry coupled with optical spectroscopy allowed the midpoint potential of the redox center to be determined for the CbiXL from both B. megaterium and Synechocystis. Sequence analysis of CbiXL proteins reveals only two conserved cysteine residues within the CbiXL proteins, which are part of an MXCXXC motif. Mutagenesis of the two cysteines leads to loss of both the EPR spectrum and UV/visible spectral features of the Fe-S center in the protein, clearly indicating that these residues are involved in ligating the cofactor to the apoprotein possibly in a butterfly arrangement.

The potential physiological role of the iron-sulfur center is discussed. Modified tetrapyrroles such as heme, chlorophyll, siroheme, and vitamin B12 (cobalamin) (1Warren M.J. Scott A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 486-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) are synthesized along a branched biosynthetic pathway, where each branch has a specific metal ion chelatase for the insertion of the particular metal ion found in the center of the tetrapyrrole-derived macrocycle. CbiX is a cobaltochelatase that inserts cobalt into sirohydrochlorin during the biosynthesis of cobalamin (vitamin B12) (Fig. 1) (2Raux E. Lanois A. Rambach A. Warren M.J. Thermes C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the Archaea, CbiX is found as a comparatively small enzyme containing between 120 and 145 amino acids and is termed CbiXS 1The abbreviations used are: CbiXS, short version of CbiX-type of cobaltochelatase; CbiXL, long version of CbiX-type of cobaltochelatase; DSM, Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany); IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside.

Chem. 2003; 278: 22388-22395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), whereas in bacteria the enzyme is approximately twice the size containing around 320 amino acids, and this long version of the protein is termed CbiXL (Fig. 2) (4Raux E. Leech H.K. Beck R. Schubert H.L. Santander P.J. Roessner C.A. Scott A.I. Martens J.H. Jahn D. Thermes C. Rambach A. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 505-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CbiXS displays similarity with both the N and C termini of CbiXL, indicating that CbiXL has probably arisen from a gene duplication and subsequent fusion of cbiXS (3Brindley A.A. Raux E. Leech H.K. Schubert H.L. Warren M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22388-22395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Alignment of CbiX sequences. A number of CbiXL sequences from Synechocystis sp., Trichodesmium erythraeum, B. megaterium, Streptomyces coelicolor, Magnetococcus sp., and Halobacterium sp. have been aligned with a CbiXS (Methanosarcina barkeri) and SirB (B. megaterium) sequence. Amino acids that share a high degree of similarity between the sequences are highlighted in gray, whereas conserved amino acids are highlighted in black. The longer CbiX sequences are characterized by a histidine-rich region in their C terminus and the presence of an MXCXXC motif. The residues within the motif that were subject to mutagenesis are marked. The C terminus of the CbiXL from Halobacterium sp. contains a further extension that displays similarity to the B. megaterium CbiW, and this alignment is also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CbiXL was first described in Bacillus megaterium and was shown to consist of 306 amino acids with a very unusual histidine-rich region toward the C terminus of the protein (2Raux E. Lanois A. Rambach A. Warren M.J. Thermes C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). More recently, a similar protein named SirB, found within a small siroheme biosynthetic operon, has been described that is capable of inserting ferrous iron into sirohydrochlorin during the biosynthesis of siroheme (4Raux E. Leech H.K. Beck R. Schubert H.L. Santander P.J. Roessner C.A. Scott A.I. Martens J.H. Jahn D. Thermes C. Rambach A. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 505-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SirB contains 266 amino acids and shares 40% identity with CbiXL. The difference in length between SirB and CbiXL is largely due to the presence of a C-terminal histidine-rich region that is found on CbiXL. Similar histidine-rich regions have been observed in proteins associated with nickel delivery to enzymes such as the hydrogenase (5Rey L. Imperial J. Palacios J.M. Ruiz-Argueso T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6066-6073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Fu C. Olson J.W. Maier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2333-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (7Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that the histidine-rich region observed in CbiXL may also be involved in metal ion storage and delivery (4Raux E. Leech H.K. Beck R. Schubert H.L. Santander P.J. Roessner C.A. Scott A.I. Martens J.H. Jahn D. Thermes C. Rambach A. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 505-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this respect, CbiXL may have its own built-in chaperone. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that this histidine-rich region is not required for catalytic activity of the chelatase (4Raux E. Leech H.K. Beck R. Schubert H.L. Santander P.J. Roessner C.A. Scott A.I. Martens J.H. Jahn D. Thermes C. Rambach A. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 505-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with the view that this region of the protein has a separate function from that of metal insertion. The CbiX family of enzymes are part of the class II group of chelatases, which are defined as homomeric monofunctional chelatases that do not require ATP for catalysis (3Brindley A.A. Raux E. Leech H.K. Schubert H.L. Warren M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22388-22395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The class II chelatases encompass another cobaltochelatase called CbiK (8Schubert H.L. Raux E. Wilson K.S. Warren M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10660-10669Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and the protoporphyrin ferrochelatase HemH (9Al-Karadaghi S. Hansson M. Nikonov S. Jonsson B. Hederstedt L. Structure. 1997; 5: 1501-1510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) as well as the siroheme-synthesizing SirB (4Raux E. Leech H.K. Beck R. Schubert H.L. Santander P.J. Roessner C.A. Scott A.I. Martens J.H. Jahn D. Thermes C. Rambach A. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 505-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has already been established that CbiK and HemH share a similar overall topology (8Schubert H.L. Raux E. Wilson K.S. Warren M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10660-10669Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and it is likely that CbiXS and CbiXL also adopt a similar fold (3Brindley A.A. Raux E. Leech H.K. Schubert H.L. Warren M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22388-22395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Indeed, it is possible that this whole class of chelatase may have evolved from a primordial CbiXS-type of enzyme. Somewhat surprisingly, a number of protoporphyrin (heme) ferrochelatases are known to contain 2Fe-2S centers (10Dailey H.A. Dailey T.A. Wu C.K. Medlock A.E. Wang K.F. Rose J.P. Wang B.C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1909-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This redox center, for which no physiological role has been firmly established, is found in most, although not all, eukaryotic protoporphyrin ferrochelatases but only in some bacterial versions of the enzyme (11Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2460-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). No redox center has yet been reported on any chelatase other than the protoporphyrin ferrochelatases. In this paper we reveal that CbiXL from both B. megaterium and Synechocystis PCC 6803 also harbors a metal cluster. EPR suggests that this is a 4Fe-4S center, and the potential role that this cluster plays in the biochemistry associated with chelation is discussed.

This was generated by PCR using B. megaterium genomic DNA as the template. The 5′ primer was designed to incorporate an NdeI restriction site (in boldface) (CG-CATATGGGAGGACATTATATGAAATCAG). The 3′ primer was designed to substitute the first histidine of the tail for a stop codon (underlined) as well as to introduce a BamHI (in boldface) site (CGGGATCCTCAATCAATATGCTCCATAATGCC). The resulting CbiX0H fragment was then cloned into pET14b to attach an N-terminal His tag, to allow purification on a chelating Sepharose column. Mutagenesis of the B. megaterium CbiXL MXCXXC Motif—The following point mutations were introduced into the CbiXpKK (pAR8882) plasmid to allow the 3 conserved residues in the MXCXXC motif to be individually converted into leucine (M257L), serine (C259S), and serine (C262S), respectively, following the instructions of the Quikchange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. All mutations were verified through DNA sequencing. Overexpression and Purification of B. megaterium CbiXL, Truncations and Mutations—The pKK223.3 constructs (pAR8882 encoding wild type CbiXL, pRBKX6 encoding CbiX6H, pHL122 encoding CbiXL M257L, pHL123 encoding CbiXL C259S, and pHL124 encoding CbiXL C262S) were transformed into the Escherichia coli cysG strain ER171. This E. coli strain was initially used to eliminate the possibility that the brown color observed when the protein was purified was due to unbound tetrapyrrole and also because it contains a plasmid harboring lacIq , which represses the tac promoter of pKK223.3. Protein production was induced by the addition of IPTG at a final concentration of 0.4 mm, when the cells reached an A 600 of 0.6, the cells were then left to grow overnight at 16 °C. The pET vector constructs pHL120 (CbiX0H pET14b) and pHL121 (Synechocystis CbiXL pET3a) were transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS- and BL21star(DE3)pLysS-competent cells, respectively. Cultures were grown, and the protein production was induced as above. Due to the presence of a naturally occurring histidine-rich region within CbiXL, the truncated and mutant proteins could be purified by passing through a His-bind column charged with NiSO4 (except that encoded by pHL120, which has an engineered N-terminal His tag). The purification was performed as described in the pET system manual instructions. The proteins were further purified by gel filtration (G-75) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl. All proteins were purified in the glove-box, which was maintained under a nitrogen environment with an oxygen concentration of less than 2 ppm. Cloning of Synechocystis PCC 6803 cbiX into pET3a—The Synechocystis PCC 6803 cbiXL gene was generated by PCR using Synechocystis PCC 6803 cells as a template. The 5′ primer was designed to incorporate an NdeI restriction site (in boldface) (CTCATATGACCTTAACCAGTGTGCCCG), whereas the 3′ primer incorporated a BamHI (in boldface) site, (CTGGATCCTAGGGAGCCTGCCAAATTTTTTCGTG). The resulting fragment was then cloned into pET3a. E. coli BL21Star(DE3)pLysS cells were transformed with this plasmid, and the resulting protein was purified as above. CbiXL Expression in B. megaterium—In order to clone the B. megaterium cbiXL to allow overproduction of the protein within B. megaterium, the gene was amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into the expression vector pWH1520 (12Rygus T. Hillen W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1991; 35: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The 5′ primer was designed to incorporate a SpeI restriction site (in boldface) so that the SpeI site is in-frame with the ATG upstream of the SpeI site in pWH1520, to make a fusion protein inducible by the addition of xylose, (GCACTAGTCGTATGGGAGGACATTATATGAAATCAG). The 3′ primer was designed to incorporate a BamHI restriction site (in boldface), (CGCATGCAAAGGATCCATCATTTTAGCTCGCCGACC). The resulting SpeI-BamHI fragment was cloned directly into pWH1520 to produce pWH1520CbiX. B. megaterium DSM 509, obtained from the German strain collection DSMZ in Braunschweig, Germany, was grown to an absorbance of 1 at 578 nm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in SMMP buffer (17.5 g/liter Antibiotic Medium No. 3 from Difco, 500 mm saccharose, 20 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm sodium maleinate, pH 6.5) including 10 mg/liter lysozyme. Formed protoplasts were washed twice in SMMP, and 10% (v/v) glycerol was added. For the transformation 2 μg of plasmid DNA in SMMP were mixed with 500 μl of protoplast solution and 1.5 ml of 40% (w/v) PEG 6000 in 500 mm saccharose, 20 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm sodium maleinate, pH 6.5. After incubation for 2 min at 20 °C, 5 ml of SMMP solution were added and the cells harvested by a short and careful centrifugation. After resuspension of the cell pellet in 500 μl of SMMP, the solution was slowly shaken for 90 min at 37 °C. The cell suspension (200 μl) was mixed and plated with 2.5 ml of cR5 top agar (300 mm saccharose, 30 mm MOPS, pH 7.3, 15 mm NaOH, 52 mm proline, 50 mm glucose, 1.3 mm K2SO4, 45 mm MgCl2, 313 μm KH2PO4, 13.8 mm CaCl2, 4% (w/v) agar, 0.2% (w/v) casamino acids, 10% (w/v) yeast extract) including 68 μm tetracycline. The resulting strain was grown in Super-LB/Tetracycline (10 mg/liter final concentration) and induced with 0.05% (w/v) xylose when the A 600 reached 0.6. The cells were then left to grow overnight at 16 °C. Purification of the resulting CbiXL protein was carried out as above. In Vitro Chelatase Assay—For CbiXL (from B. megaterium and Synechocystis), the truncations and mutants were overproduced and purified as described above and were diluted to 1.0 mg ml–1 for the assay in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl. Chelatase assays were performed as described previously (13Schubert H.L. Raux E. Brindley A.A. Leech H.K. Wilson K.S. Hill C.P. Warren M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) by monitoring the conversion of sirohydrochlorin into cobalt-sirohydrochlorin. Sirohydrochlorin was generated in situ under an atmosphere of nitrogen in a glove-box, with less than 2 ppm oxygen. This was accomplished by incubating 2.5 mg of porphobilinogen in a total volume of 40 ml containing 5 mg of purified PBG deaminase, 1 mg of purified uroporphyrinogen III synthase, 5 mg of purified uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase, 15 mg of S-adenosyl-l-methionine, 5 mg of a precorrin-2 dehydrogenase (SirC), and 10 mg of NAD+. The reaction was left overnight at room temperature to allow it to reach completion, and the mixture was filtered prior to use. The rate of the chelatase reaction was calculated by measuring the rate of disappearance of sirohydrochlorin, using the extinction coefficient of 2.4 × 105m–1 cm–1. The chelatase activity was measured with sirohydrochlorin (2.5 μm), Co2+ (20 μm), and varying amounts of CbiXL, truncations, and mutant variants in a 1-ml reaction volume in 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8. For all reactions, initial rates were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard 8452A photodiode array spectrophotometer, and assays were performed in triplicate in the glove-box. Atomic Absorption—To determine iron content of B. megaterium CbiXL, purified protein samples were analyzed using a Varian Spectra AA220FS Atomic Absorption Spectrometer, using Spectrosol Fe2+ as the standard. EPR—Dithionite-reduced protein samples (11.5 mm sodium dithionite, final concentration) were prepared from both purified CbiXL proteins, the truncations, and two of the mutants. All samples were prepared in the glove-box ([O2] < 2 ppm), loaded into EPR tubes, sealed with a cap, and then transferred to a liquid nitrogen Dewar. EPR spectra were obtained at X-band using a Bruker ELEXSYS E500 spectrometer, equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR900 liquid helium cryostat. Redox Potentiometry—Redox titrations were performed in a Belle Technology glove-box under a nitrogen atmosphere, essentially as described previously (14Munro A.W. Noble M.A. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). All solutions were degassed under vacuum with argon. Oxygen levels were maintained at less than 2 ppm. The protein solution, ∼200 μm in 8 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, was titrated electrochemically according to the method of Dutton (15Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) using sodium dithionite as reductant and potassium ferricyanide as oxidant. Mediators (2 μm phenazine methosulfate, 5 μm 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, 0.5 μm methyl viologen, and 1 μm benzyl viologen) were included to mediate in the range between +100 and –480 mV, as described previously (14Munro A.W. Noble M.A. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 16Ost T.W.B. Miles C.S. Munro A.W. Murdoch J. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13421-13429Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). At least 15 min was allowed to elapse between each addition of reductant or oxidant to allow stabilization of the electrode. Spectra (300–800 nm) were recorded using a Cary UV-50 Bio UV/visible scanning spectrophotometer via a fiber optic absorption probe (Cary) immersed in the enzyme solution and connected to the external spectrophotometer. The electrochemical potential of the solution was measured using a Hanna pH 211 meter coupled to a platinum/Calomel electrode (ThermoRussell Ltd.) at 25 °C. The electrode was calibrated using the Fe3+/Fe2+ EDTA couple as a standard (+108 mV). A factor of +244 mV was used to correct relative to the standard hydrogen electrode. Generation of Bacterial Two-hybrid Constructs Containing CoaTN and CbiXL—In order to clone cbiXL from Synechocystis PCC 6803 into the pBT Bait vector for use in the BacterioMatch™ Two-hybrid System, a PCR fragment was generated using Synechocystis PCC 6803 cells. The 5′ primer was designed to incorporate a NotI restriction site (in boldface) so that the cloned gene was in frame with the λcl open reading frame of the pBT Bait plasmid (GAGCGGCCGCTATGACCTTAACCAGTGTGC). The same 3′ primer (as above) was used again. PCR products were ligated to pGEM-T prior to subcloning into NotI/BamHI sites of pBT creating pBTCbiX. pTRGCoaTN, pBTATX1, and pTRG-PACSN were generated as described previously (17Tottey S.

CbiXL Contains a Fe-S Center—The B. megaterium CbiXL protein is overproduced to a level of about 20 mg/liter as a recombinant protein in E. coli cells transformed with pAR8882. The presence of the naturally occurring histidine-rich region on the C terminus of the protein allows it to be purified easily by metal chelate chromatography, and the isolated protein migrates as a 35-kDa band when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). However, when CbiXL is purified in this way we observed that the protein is isolated as a brown solution with an absorbance in its UV/visible spectrum around 420 nm (Fig. 3B). Further repeated purification steps on a gel filtration column led to a gradual loss of the color, which also coincided with a greater tendency of the protein to form inactive multimers, as judged by non-denaturing electrophoresis (data not shown). When these gel filtration studies were performed under anaerobic conditions, in a glove-box, the protein retained its coloration, and aggregation was not observed. One interpretation of these observations is that the protein contains a Fe-S center, which dissociates from the protein in the presence of oxygen allowing the protein to form aggregates through the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. On the basis of the UV/visible spectrum, if the protein does contain a Fe-S center, it is more likely to be a 4Fe-4S center because these redox centers tend to have broad, less featured UV/visible spectra than the 2Fe-2S centers. To confirm that the recombinant B. megaterium CbiXL harbors a Fe-S center, the protein was purified and concentrated to about 10 mg/ml, reduced with dithionite, and analyzed by EPR spectrometry. When reduced with dithionite, a pseudo-axial spectrum (Fig. 3C) was recorded at 15 K, which is characteristic of a reduced 4Fe-4S center, with g values at 2.04, 1.94, and 1.90. In keeping with this assignment, the spectrum was not observed at 70 K. More detailed pulsed electron nuclear double resonance analysis (data not shown) of the purified protein did not reveal anything significant in terms of the presence of nitrogen ligands, so it seems likely that the Fe-S center is held via four cysteine residues. Fe-S Cluster Is Not an Artifact—There are examples in the literature of Fe-S centers being formed erroneously in recombinant proteins in E. coli, especially those containing zinc finger motifs (see for example Refs. 19Li P.M. Reichert J. Freyd G. Horvitz H.R. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9210-9213Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar and 20Archer V.E.V. Breton J. Sanchez-Garcia I. Osada H. Forster A. Thomson A.J. Rabbitts T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). CbiXL contains an MXCXXC motif (see Fig. 2) in close proximity to the histidinerich region of the protein, and this means that CbiXL may also be classified as a zinc finger protein. In order to demonstrate that the Fe-S center on CbiXL has not formed due to some serendipitous arrangement of cysteine groups within the tertiary structure of the protein and an artifact of recombinant expression, we overproduced the Synechocystis PCC 6803 CbiXL as a recombinant protein in E. coli and also overproduced the B. megaterium CbiXL within B. megaterium. Overproduction of the Synechocystis CbiXL was achieved by cloning the cbiXL gene into pET3a and transforming it into E. coli BL21(DE3) pLys. Induction with IPTG resulted in the large scale overproduction of CbiXL, which could be easily purified using metal chelate chromatography due to the presence of the naturally occurring histidine-rich region found also on this protein. The protein ran with a molecular mass of 38 kDa by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). The recombinant purified protein had a low specific activity, which was only 5% of the activity observed in the B. megaterium enzyme (Table II). This low activity may be due to a number of reasons including the fact that no attempt was made t"

Interaction between R735 in TM7 of subunit a and the glutamic acid residue in the middle of TM4 of subunits c and c′ or TM2 of subunit c″ has been proposed to be essential for proton release to the luminal compartment. In order to determine whether the helical face of TM7 of subunit a containing R735 is capable of interacting with the helical face of TM4 of subunit c′ containing the essential glutamic acid residue (Glu-145), cysteine-mediated cross-linking between these subunits in yeast has been performed. Cys-less forms of subunits a and c′ as well as forms containing unique cysteine residues were constructed, introduced together into a strain disrupted in both endogenous subunits, and tested for growth at neutral pH, for assembly competence and for cross-linking in the presence of cupric-phenanthroline by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Four different cysteine mutants of subunit a were each tested pairwise with ten different unique cysteine mutants of subunit c′. Strong cross-linking was observed for the pairs aS728C/c′I142C, aA731C/c′E145C, aA738C/c′F143C, aA738C/c′L147C, and aL739C/c′L147C. Partial cross-linking was observed for an additional 13 of 40 pairs analyzed. When arrayed on a helical wheel diagram, the results suggest that the helical face of TM7 of subunit a containing Arg-735 interacts with the helical face of TM4 of subunit c′ centered on Val-146 and bounded by Glu-145 and Leu-147.

Thus the V-ATPases also appear to operate by a rotational mechanism. Because proton translocation through the V0 domain is thought to be critically dependent upon the interaction between subunit a and the ring of proteolipid subunits, it is important to define the nature of the helical interactions that occur between these proteins. In order to obtain information about these interactions, we have carried disulfide-mediated cross-linking between subunit a and subunit c′ of the yeast V-ATPase.

Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase and other molecular biology reagents were from Invitrogen, Promega, and New England Biolabs. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and most other chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Yeast strains lacking the VMA11, VPH1, and STV1 genes were constructed by replacing the entire coding region of VMA11 with the TRP gene and insertion of the LEU gene into the VPH1 gene and the LYS gene STV1 gene at the positions indicated by Manolson et al. (50Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the YPH500 yeast strain. YEPD buffered to pH 5.5 or pH 7.5 was used for selection of strains showing a vma– phenotype. Transformation and Selection—Yeast cells lacking functional endogenous Vph1p, Stv1p, and Vma11p were transformed using the lithium acetate method (51Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). The transformants were selected on histidine minus and uracil minus plates and growth phenotypes of the mutants were assessed on YEPD plates buffered with 50 mm KH2PO4 or 50 mm succinic acid to either pH 7.5 or pH 5.5. Site directed mutants of Vph1p and Vma11p were constructed using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega). Isolation of Vacuolar-enriched Membrane Fractions—Vacuolar-enriched membrane fractions were isolated using a subcellular fractionation protocol described previously (52Horazdovsky B.F. Emr S.D. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), to facilitate analysis of the large number of double mutants constructed. Yeast cells were cultured in S.D.-HIS-URA medium to an OD600 of 1. Cells (3 × 109) were converted to spheroplasts by treatment with 150 μg/ml Zymolyase 100T in YEPD containing 0.7 m sorbitol, 0.1 m Tris-Mes (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol followed by lysis in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) 0.2 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA) and sedimentation for 5 min at 500 × g to remove unbroken cells. The supernatant was centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g to generate the vacuole membrane-enriched fraction. Pelleted membranes were suspended in cross-linking buffer and used for the cross-linking experiments described below. Protein concentrations were measured by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Analysis of Subunit Expression and V-ATPase Assembly—Whole cell lysates and vacuolar membrane enriched fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% acrylamide gels. The presence of Vma11p on vacuolar membranes was detected by Western blotting using the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody 3F10 against HA, while Vph1p was detected using the monoclonal antibodies 10D7 (Molecular Probes, OR), followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). Blots were developed using a chemiluminescent detection method obtained from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). Detection of Cross-linking of Subunits a and c′—Direct cross-linking of cysteine residues introduced into subunits a and c′ was performed using a modification of the protocol described previously by Jiang and Fillingame (54Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, vacuolar membrane vesicles were washed using labeling buffer (5 mm Tris-Mes, pH 7.5, 0.25 mm MgCl2 and 1.1 m glycerol) and divided into two tubes. 2.5 mm of Cu(1,10-phenanthroline)2SO4 was added to one tube, and both samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by addition of EDTA and N-ethylmaleimide to a final concentration of 15 mm and 20 mm, respectively. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on 7.5% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody 3F10 against the HA epitope tag. Blots were developed using the Supersignal ULTRA chemiluminescent system (Pierce). Other Procedures—Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce, IL). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out as described by Laemmli (55Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar).

The VMA11 gene was then expressed in this strain using the pRS413 plasmid containing the HIS marker whereas the VPH1 gene was expressed using the pRS316 plasmid containing the URA marker. We had previously shown that a Cys-less form of Vph1p supported wild-type growth of cells at pH 7.5 (58Leng X.H. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14655-14661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that complexes retaining >20% of wild-type activity in vitro generally display a wild-type growth phenotype (59Liu J. Kane P.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10938-10948Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 60MacLeod K.J. Vasilyeva E. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol.

Cells expressing Cys-less Vph1p were next transformed with a Cys-less form of Vma11p and were found to also show wild-type growth at pH 7.5. These results indicate that there are no endogenous cysteine residues in either Vph1p or Vma11p that are absolutely required for V-ATPase activity. We had previously demonstrated that Arg-735 in TM7 of Vph1p is essential for proton transport activity and suggested that this residue interacts with the buried carboxyl groups present in TM4 of subunits c and c′ and TM2 of subunit c″ (19Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12397-12402Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Using a helical wheel diagram, four a subunit residues that were predicted to lie on the same helical face of TM7 as Arg-735 were chosen for replacement with cysteine, including Ser-728, Ala-731, Ala-738, and Leu-739. When transformed into yeast expressing the Cys-less form of Vma11p, all four single cysteine-containing mutants of Vph1p gave wild-type growth at pH 7.5. We next constructed a series of ten single cysteine-containing mutants of Vma11p in which each of the residues in TM4 between Ile-140 and Leu-149 was replaced with cysteine. Because TM4 of Vma11p is predicted to extend from Val-135 to Ile-157 (56Nishi T. Kawasaki-Nishi S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5821-5827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the region subjected to cysteine mutagenesis corresponds to approximately the central half of this transmembrane segment surrounding Glu-145. Yeast strains were then constructed containing one of the four single cysteine-containing mutants of Vph1p and the Cys-less form or one of the ten single cysteine-containing mutants of Vma11p. The growth phenotype of each of the 44 resultant double mutant strains at pH 7.5 is shown in Table I. As can be seen, all of the double mutants containing the E145C mutation of subunit c′ failed to grow at pH 7.5, as predicted from previous results demonstrating that Glu-145 is an essential residue for proton transport by the V-ATPase (21Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition, several of the double mutants containing the a subunit mutation L739C showed severely defective growth at neutral pH. The majority of the double mutants, however, showed normal (or near normal) growth at pH 7.5.Table ISummary of growth phenotype of cysteine-substituted mutants at neutral pHac′Ile-140Leu-141Ile-142Phe-143Ser-144Glu-145Val-146Leu-147Gly-148Leu-149Cys-lessSer-728+++++++++++++++-+++++++++++++++Ala-731+++++++++++++-+++++++++++++++Ala-738+++++++++++++-++++++++++++++Ile-739++++++++-+++--+++++++ Open table in a new tab Assembly of V0 Complexes Containing Cysteine Mutations in Subunits a and c′—To test the assembly competence of the V0 complexes present in the double mutant strains, partially purified vacuolar membranes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses using antibodies against Vph1p and the HA-tagged Vma11p were performed. The presence of subunit a and the proteolipid subunits in isolated vacuoles indicates normal assembly of the V0 domain (49Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 1, all of the double mutants tested showed normal levels of both Vph1p and Vma11p relative to the wild-type strain, indicating normal assembly and targeting of the V0 domain to the vacuole. Cysteine-mediated Cross-linking of Subunits a and c′ by Disulfide Bond Formation—To test the proximity of the cysteine residues introduced into TM7 of subunit a and TM4 of subunit c′, vacuolar membrane vesicles were incubated in the absence or presence of cupric-phenanthroline for 30 min at room temperature to catalyze disulfide bond formation. The reaction was terminated by addition of EDTA and N-ethylmaleimide and the samples separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody against the HA epitope tag present on Vma11p. The results obtained for vacuolar membranes isolated from the strains expressing the S728C mutant of subunit a and each of the ten single cysteine-containing forms of subunit c′ (together with the Cys-less form) are shown in Fig. 2, panel a. As can be seen, a band reactive with the HA antibody is observed at a molecular weight of 120 kDa for the double mutant containing the S728C form of subunit a and the I142C form of subunit c′. A weaker band can also be observed for the aS728C/c′V146C double mutant. These results suggest that the cysteine residue at position 728 of subunit a is sufficiently close to the cysteine residue at position 142 of subunit c′ to be able to form a disulfide bond. The weaker cross-linked band observed for the aS728C/c′V146C double mutant may be due either to a lower proximity of these two residues or to a smaller fraction of the population having these residues in proximity (see “Discussion”). These results are summarized in the helical wheel diagram shown in Fig. 3, panel a.Fig. 3Helical wheel diagram depicting the location of the major and minor cross-linked products obtained using cysteine-substituted mutants of subunits a and c′. Each panel corresponds to the cross-linked products obtained with one of the single cysteine-containing mutants of subunit a, S728C (panel a), A731C (panel b), A738C (panel c), and L739C (panel d). The major cross-linked bands are depicted with a heavy dashed line (i.e. AS728C/c′I142C) whereas the lower yield cross-linked products are shown with a thin dashed line (i.e. aS728C/c′V146C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The cross-linking results obtained for the double mutants containing aA731C, aA738C, or aL739C and each of the single cysteine-containing forms of subunit c′ are shown in Fig. 2, panels b–d and depicted diagrammatically in Fig. 3, panels b–d. The cross-linking results obtained for all of the double mutants analyzed are summarized in Table II. As can be seen, the strongest cross-linked bands were observed for the double mutants aS728C/c′I142C, aA731C/c′E145C, aA738C/c′F143C, aA738C/c′L147C, and aL739C/c′L147C. Additional weaker cross-linked bands were observed for 13 of 40 double mutants analyzed. Particularly frequent as a participant in cross-linking to subunit a were cysteine residues at positions Ile-142, Phe-143, Glu-145, Val-146, and Leu-147 of subunit c′. All of these residues are present on the same helical face of TM4 of subunit c′ that, in cross-section, is centered on Val-146 and bordered by Leu-147 and Glu-145 (see Fig. 3). These results suggest that this helical face of TM4 of subunit c′ is in proximity to the helical face of TM7 of subunit a containing Arg-735. There is, nevertheless, considerable variation in the radial distribution of the c′ residues capable of cross-linking to subunit a. The possible significance of this variation in cross-linking sites is discussed below.Table IISummary of disulfide-mediated cross-linking of cysteine-substituted mutants of subunits a and c′ac′Ile-140Leu-141Ile-142Phe-143Ser-144Glu-145Val-146Leu-147Gly-148Leu-149Cys-lessSer-728--+++---+----Ala-731--+++-++++++---Ala-738-+++++-+++++++--Leu-739--+++--n.d.+++++-- Open table in a new tab The integral V0 domain of the V-ATPase contains three different proteolipid subunits (c, c′, and c″) that are required for activity (21Hirata R.

https://openalex.org/W2012196658,"We identified two splice variants of lipophorin receptor (LpR) gene products specific to the mosquito fat body (AaLpRfb) and ovary (AaLpRov) with respective molecular masses of 99.3 and 128.9 kDa. Each LpR variant encodes a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family with five characteristic domains: 1) ligand recognition, 2) epidermal growth factor precursor, 3) putative O-linked sugar, 4) single membrane-spanning domains, and 5) the cytoplasmic tail with a highly conserved internalization signal FDNPVY. Proposed phylogenetic relationships among low density lipoprotein receptor superfamily members suggest that the LpRs of insects are more closely related to vertebrate low density lipoprotein receptors and very low density lipoprotein receptor/vitellogenin receptor than to insect vitellogenin receptor/yolk protein receptors. Two mosquito LpR isoforms differ in their amino termini, the ligand-binding domains, and O-linked sugar domains, which are generated by differential splicing. Polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot hybridization analyses show that these two transcripts originated from a single gene. Significantly, the putative ligand-binding domain consists of seven and eight complement-type, cysteine-rich repeats in AaLpRfb and AaLRov, respectively. Seven cysteine-rich repeats in AaLpRfb are identical to the second through eighth repeats of AaLpRov. Previous analyses (1) have indicated that the AaLpRov transcript is present exclusively in ovarian germ-line cells, nurse cells, and oocytes throughout the previtellogenic and vitellogenic stages, with the peak at 24-30 h after blood meal, coincident with the peak of yolk protein uptake. In contrast, the fat body-specific AaLpRfb transcript expression is restricted to the postvitellogenic period, during which yolk protein production is terminated and the fat body is transformed to a storage depot of lipid, carbohydrate, and protein."
https://openalex.org/W2064329399,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is genetically linked to the processing of amyloid β protein precursor (AβPP). Aside from being the precursor of the amyloid β (Aβ) found in plaques in the brains of patients with AD, little is known regarding the functional role of AβPP. We have recently reported biochemical evidence linking AβPP to the JNK signaling cascade by finding that JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP-1) binds AβPP. In order to study the functional implications of this interaction we assayed the carboxyl-terminal of AβPP for phosphorylation. We found that the threonine 668 within the AβPP intracellular domain (AID or elsewhere AICD) is indeed phosphorylated by JNK1. We surprisingly found that although JIP-1 can facilitate this phosphorylation, it is not required for this process. We also found that JIP-1 only facilitated phosphorylation of AβPP but not of the two other family members APLP1 (amyloid precursor-like protein 1) and APLP2. Understanding the connection between AβPP phosphorylation and the JNK signaling pathway, which mediates cell response to stress may have important implications in understanding the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease."

Here we compared wild type and AZT-resistant (D67N/K70R/T215Y/K219Q) RTs for their ability to unblock the AZTMP-terminated primer by phosphorolysis in the presence of physiological concentrations of pyrophosphate or ATP. The AZT-resistant enzyme, as it has been previously described, showed an increased ability to unblock the AZTMP-terminated primer by an ATP-dependent mechanism. We found that only mutations in the p66 subunit were responsible for this ability. We also found that three structurally divergent non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), nevirapine, TIBO, and a 4-arylmethylpyridinone derivative, were able to inhibit the phosphorolytic activity of the enzyme, rendering the AZT-resistant RT sensitive to AZTTP. The 4-arylmethylpyridinone derivative proved to be about 1000-fold more potent in inhibiting phosphorolysis than nevirapine or TIBO. Moreover, combinations of AZTTP with NNRTIs exhibited an exceptionally high degree of synergy in the inhibition of AZT-resistant enzyme only when ATP or PPi were present, indicating that inhibition of phosphorolysis was responsible for the synergy found in the combination. Our results not only demonstrate the importance of phosphorolysis concerning HIV-1 RT resistance to AZT but also point to the implication of this activity in the strong synergy found in some combinations of NNRTIs with AZT.

Numerous compounds that inhibit the DNA polymerase activity of RT have been described. They can be divided into two broad classes. The first group, that of nucleoside analogs, includes dideoxynucleoside compounds, such as 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine and AZT, that inhibit viral replication by acting as chain terminators of DNA synthesis (1Parker W.B. White E.L. Shaddix S.C. Ross L.J. Buckheit Jr., R.W. Germany J.M. Secrist J.A.d. Vince R. Shannon W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1754-1762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second group, the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), includes a large number of structurally dissimilar hydrophobic compounds that bind to a site on the RT palm subdomain adjacent to but distinct from the polymerase active site (2Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar). The FDA-approved HIV-1 therapies involve drugs that inhibit two viral enzymes, reverse transcriptase and protease. AZT was the first drug approved against HIV-1 and is still widely used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. The prolonged clinical use of this nucleoside analog in monotherapy gives rise to highly resistant viruses containing mutations in the RT enzyme, D67N, K70R, T215F/Y, K219E/Q (3Larder B.A. Kemp S.D. Science. 1989; 246: 1155-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar), and, in some cases, M41L and L210W. Viruses carrying at least four mutations are more than 100-fold less sensitive to AZT than wild type virus in cell culture. Although the genotype for AZT resistance is well characterized, it has been impossible to detect resistance to AZT 5′-triphosphate (AZTTP) in polymerization assays using recombinant RTs carrying these mutations. Recently, it has been demonstrated that HIV-1 RT can remove some 3′-terminal chain-terminating residues from blocked DNA using either pyrophosphate or ATP as substrate (4Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 5Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. So A.G. Scott W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13471-13476Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The prevailing hypothesis nowadays is that mutations conferring resistance to AZT do not interfere with the incorporation of the inhibitor but increase the excision rate of AZTMP from the 3′-end of the nascent DNA (4Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 6Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Schinazi R.F. So A.G. Scott W.A. Antimicrob.

Virol. 2001; 75: 4832-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the thiocarboxanilide non-nucleoside inhibitor UC781, in combination with AZTTP, synergistically inhibits the replication of AZT-resistant HIV-1 virus (8Borkow G. Arion D. Wainberg M.A. Parniak M.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 259-263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because UC781 was also able to block the pyrophosphorolytic reaction, it has been suggested that this inhibition could enhance the effect of AZT and might be a relevant mechanism for the delayed development of resistance to combinations of AZT plus UC781 in antiviral assays. Our work was aimed to find the biochemical mechanism mediating the synergy between AZT and NNRTIs obtained with the AZT-resistant RT. At present it is not known whether the inhibition of the pyrophosphorolytic activity is specific for UC781, because no other NNRTI has been reported to block this activity. Moreover, the effect of NNRTIs on ATP-dependent phosphorolysis has not been tested. We therefore analyzed the effect of two structurally dissimilar compounds, nevirapine and TIBO 82913 (9Merluzzi V.J. Hargrave K.D. Labadia M. Grozinger K. Skoog M. Wu J.C. Shih C.K. Eckner K.

We found that all NNRTI were able to inhibit the phosphorolytic activity of the enzyme, although with different potencies. Furthermore, we analyzed the interaction between AZTTP and NNRTIs with the AZT-resistant enzyme. Because both groups of inhibitors bind to different sites on RT in a nonexclusive manner (12Spence R.A. Kati W.M. Anderson K.S. Johnson K.A. Science. 1995; 267: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), combinations of nucleoside analogs and non-nucleoside inhibitors might have a potential synergistic inhibitory effect on HIV-1 RT.

In this report we show that combinations of AZTTP with NNRTIs show an exceptionally high degree of synergy in inhibiting AZT-resistant enzyme only when ATP or PPi are present, showing that inhibition of phosphorolysis may be implicated in the mechanism of this interaction in vivo.

Both clones were grown and induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside separately, and the cell pellets were mixed maintaining an excess of the p51 subunit. The cells were disrupted in a French press and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography as described (20Villahermosa M.L. Martinez-Irujo J.J. Cabodevilla F. Santiago E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13223-13231Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Excess of monomeric p51 was removed by gel filtration through a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) (23Cabodevilla J.F. Odriozola L. Santiago E. Martinez-Irujo J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). AZT-resistant RT (AZTr-RT) contained four amino acid substitutions, D67N, K70R, T215Y, and K219Q, introduced in the genes of both subunits using the same mutagenesis kit. The presence of expected mutations was verified by the complete sequencing of all RT clones. All of the enzyme preparations were homogeneous as judged by gel filtration and SDS-PAGE. PAGE Analysis of Polymerization Assay—The DNA oligonucleotide termed d21 (5′-GGGGATCCTCTAGAGTCGACC-3′) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP at the 5′-end and then annealed to a 36-nucleotide RNA template called r36 (5′-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGUCGACUCUAGAGGAUCCCC-3′). This primer-template was incubated with the enzyme in the presence of 10 μm dTTP in buffer A (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1.25 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40 at pH 8) and started by adding 10 mm MgCl2 (pH 8) in a final volume of 25 μl. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of 25 μl of loading buffer (90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanol). The samples were analyzed by denaturing PAGE using 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. The electrophoretically resolved products were visualized by autoradiography, and the amount of total product obtained was calculated by densitometric quantification of all oligonucleotides longer than 35 nucleotides using Imagemaster software (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of AZTMP-terminated Primer—Oligonucleotide d21 (1 nmol) annealed with r36 (2 nmol) was incubated with 10 nm RT and 100 μm AZTTP in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 4 mm MgCl2 (pH 8) for 4 h at 37 °C in a final volume of 200 μl. The chain-terminated primer-template was precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in 90% formamide and 10 mm EDTA, and finally purified by denaturing PAGE using a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. The bands were visualized on a TLC silica gel plate under UV light, and the band corresponding to the terminated primer was cut out. The oligonucleotide was eluted from the gel in 0.3 m sodium acetate and 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in 25 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8). Phosphorolysis Assay—The d21-AZTMP oligonucleotide was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP at the 5′-end and then annealed to a 39-nucleotide RNA template called r39 (5′-AAAAAAAAUAAAAGAACAGGUCGACUCUAGAGGAUCCCC-3′). This primer-template was incubated with the enzyme in the presence of the indicated concentrations of PPi or ATP in Buffer B (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, pH 8), and the reaction was started by adding 10 mm MgCl2 (pH 8) in a final volume of 25 μl. After incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by the addition of the same volume of loading buffer (90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanol). The samples were analyzed by denaturing PAGE using 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. The bands were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by densitometry as before. Because RT eliminates several nucleotides from the terminated primer, the amount of total product obtained was calculated by densitometric quantification of all oligonucleotides smaller than 22 nucleotides. Combination Assays—The enzyme was incubated in Buffer A with 3 nm poly(rA)-dT20, 10 μm [α-33P]dTTP in the presence or absence of 3 mm ATP or 250 μm PPi in a final volume of 50 μl. The reactions were started with 10 mm MgCl2, and after 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were quenched by adding 5 μl of EDTA 0.5 m. Fifteen μl of the mixture were spotted onto a DE81 (Whatman), washed three times with 0.5 m Na2HPO4 (pH 7.5), dried, and counted. The interaction index was calculated as explained previously (20Villahermosa M.L. Martinez-Irujo J.J. Cabodevilla F. Santiago E.

Briefly, dose-response curves for each inhibitor alone were obtained within a wide range of effects by fitting experimental data to Equation 1 by unweighted nonlinear regression. f=11+IC50Dm(Eq. 1) where f is the fractional inhibition, D represents the concentration (dose) of the inhibitor when tested alone, IC50 is the concentration of the inhibitor giving 50% of inhibition, and m is a parameter giving the sigmoidicity of the dose-response curve, using the commercial available fitting program Grafit (Erithacus software). Interaction between inhibitors was evaluated by means of the interaction index (I). I=d1D1+d2D2(Eq. 2) where D 1 and D 2 are the concentrations of inhibitors 1 and 2 individually producing the same effect as the combination (d 1 + d 2) (24Martinez-Irujo J.J. Villahermosa M.L.

When I = 1, agents in the combination do not interact; if I > 1, the combination is antagonistic, and if I < 1 the combination is synergistic. Rate of Phosphorolysis by wt RT and Mutant AZTr-RT—AZT resistance has been related to an increased phosphorolytic activity of the mutant RT, leading to the removal of AZTMP from a chain-terminated primer (4Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 5Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. So A.G. Scott W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

We measured the rate of phosphorolysis for wt and resistant RTs (Fig. 1A). At saturating RT concentrations, excision of AZT followed apparent first order kinetics. The addition of 150 μm PPi resulted in a similar rate of pyrophosphorolysis for both wt and resistant enzymes, with rate constants of 0.081 ± 0.009 and 0.074 ± 0.007 min-1, respectively (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, when 3 mm ATP was used as substrate instead of PPi, wt RT showed a very slow removal of the chain terminator, with a rate constant of 0.001 ± 0.0002 min-1. Under these conditions, this reaction was more efficient for resistant RT, which showed a rate constant of 0.011 ± 0.001 min-1. The experimental procedure employed to purify the heterodimeric RT (see “Experimental Procedures”) allowed us to obtain a nonphysiological RT chimera, containing the four mutations (D67N, K70R, T215Y, and K219Q) only in the p66 subunit, whereas the p51 subunit contained the wild type sequence. This hybrid RT showed a rate of pyrophosphorolysis similar to the wild type and AZT-resistant enzymes (k app = 0.065 ± 0.004 min-1). Unlike wild type enzyme, the chimeric RT efficiently catalyzed ATP-dependent phosphorolysis (k app = 0.020 ± 0.005 min-1). These data clearly show that only mutations in the p66 subunit were responsible for the increased ability of the mutant enzyme to unblock the AZTMP-terminated primer by an ATP-dependent mechanism. Inhibition of Phosphorolysis by NNRTIs—Non-nucleoside compounds are well known inhibitors of HIV-1 RT DNA polymerase. We tested whether these compounds could also inhibit the phosphorolysis catalyzed by wt and AZT-resistant RTs, using a primer blocked at its 3′-end by AZTMP at saturating RT concentrations. As shown in Fig. 2 and Table I, nevirapine, 9-Cl-TIBO, and 4-arylmethylpyridinone inhibit the phosphorolytic activity, although with a different efficiency. 9-Cl-TIBO was the weakest inhibitor, whereas the 4-arylmethylpyridinone was the most efficient. The latter compound was about 1000-fold more potent to block pyrophosphorolysis than nevirapine and inhibited both ATP- and PPi-dependent phosphorolysis in the nanomolar range.Table IInhibition of polymerization and phosphorolysis catalyzed by wt RT and AZT r-RTIC50Nevirapine9-Cl-TIBO4-Arylmethylpyridinoneμ mwt RTPolymerizationa25 nM of RT was incubated with 2 nm [32P]d21-r36 and the NNRTI in the presence of 10 μm dTTP in buffer A and started by adding 10 mm MgCl2.

Open table in a new tab We analyzed whether the inhibition by 4-arylmethylpyridinone was due to the impaired binding of the template-primer or ATP upon binding of the NNRTI. In previous work, we found that 4-arylmethylpyridinone was a linear noncompetitive inhibitor against dGTP in polymerization reactions, with a K i of 35 nm (11Dolle V. Nguyen C.H. Legraverend M. Aubertin A.M. Kirn A. Andreola M.L. Ventura M. Tarrago-Litvak L. Bisagni E. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 3949-3962Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetics analysis of inhibition by 4-arylmethylpyridinone against template-primer was examined by varying the concentration of poly(rA)-dT20 while maintaining [α-33P]dTTP at a fixed concentration of 10 μm. 4-Arylmethylpyridinone displayed a complex inhibition pattern with respect to template-primer. At low concentrations of template-primer (<10 nm), the pattern was essentially uncompetitive, indicating that this compound preferentially binds to the RT/template-primer complex. Above this value the pattern changed to mixed noncompetitive (data not shown). To confirm that this compound preferentially binds to the DNA-RT complex, 2 nm poly(rA)-dT20 was incubated for 2 min with 10 μm [α-33P]dTTP, variable concentrations of 4-arylmethylpyridinone and 2, 5, 10, or 25 nm of AZTr-RT. Under these conditions, IC50 values for 4-arylmethylpyridinone were 72, 59, 47, and 24 nm, respectively. In the same experiment, IC50 values for nevirapine were 0.87, 0.85, 2.2, and 2.8 μm. As a control, inhibition by 4-arylmethylpyridinone was measured under the same conditions except than a fixed concentration of AZTr-RT was used (50 nm), and increasing concentrations of poly(rA)-dT20 were added (2-25 nm). In this case, the IC50 values for 4-arylmethylpyridinone increased from 87 to 250 nm. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that 4-arylmethylpyridinone preferentially binds to the RT-template-primer complex rather than to the free enzyme. In fact, the concentration of this compound needed to half-inhibit the ATP-dependent phosphorolysis reaction using 2 nm r39-d21-AZTMP, 3 mm ATP, and 5-50 nm of RT is about 1-2 nm, irrespective of the total enzyme concentration added. The effect of NNRTIs on ATP binding is difficult to determine. Direct binding assays using labeled ATP are not possible, because millimolar concentrations of the nucleotide are needed, whereas the RT concentration is in the nanomolar to low micromolar range. We tested by an indirect approach whether the concentration of ATP or PPi affects the inhibition caused by 4-arylmethylpyridinone. Useful ATP concentrations were 1-9 mm, because higher concentrations result in substrate inhibition of the phosphorolytic reaction. In the range 0-9 mm ATP, the IC50 for 4-arylmethylpyridinone in the RT-catalyzed phosphorolysis reaction only increased about 1.5-fold. The inhibition of DNA polymerization by NNRTI in the absence of AZTTP was also slightly sensitive to the presence of ATP, with the IC50 values increasing about 1.5-2-fold. These results suggest that NNRTIs do not exert their activity by impacting on ATP binding, although some interference with ATP may be present. Effect of ATP and PP i on the Rescue of AZTMP-terminated Primer—Because ATP lysis is sensitive to the presence of the next incoming nucleotide (6Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Schinazi R.F. So A.G.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18611-18618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we measured the sensitivity of RT to AZTTP in the polymerization reaction. These assays were performed with an adenine-rich template to allow the incorporation of AZTTP and the subsequent excision of the incorporated AZT during reaction. When AZTTP was not added to the reaction medium, RT was able to add bases in the absence of template once the primer was completely polymerized. (Fig. 3A). In agreement with earlier observations (3Larder B.A. Kemp S.D. Science. 1989; 246: 1155-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar), in the absence of pyrophosphorolysis, AZTTP was equally potent in the inhibition of DNA synthesis catalyzed by both wt and AZTr-RT enzymes, with IC50 values of 0.20 and 0.26 μm, respectively. Inhibition by AZTTP was lower in the presence of PPi. This effect was similar for both the wt and the mutant RTs (IC50 values were 0.93 and 1.1 μm, respectively). Inhibition by AZTTP was also reduced in the presence of ATP. The reduction was less pronounced for the wt RT than for the AZTr-RT (Fig. 3B). These results were consistent with the observed rates of phosphorolysis for the enzymes with ATP and PPi. Effect of the NNRTIs on the Sensitivity of Resistant RT to AZTTP in the Presence of ATP or PP i—We have demonstrated that the presence of physiological concentrations of PPi or ATP reduces the sensitivity of RT to AZTTP. This decrease was due to the phosphorolysis-mediated rescue of the AZTMP-terminated chain. On the other hand, we also found that NNRTIs can inhibit the phosphorolysis catalyzed by AZT-resistant RT. Because resistance toward AZTTP is due to the increased unblocking capacity of AZT-terminated primer by mutant RT, it should be expected that inhibition of phosphorolysis by a NNRTI would resensitize the AZTr-RT to AZTTP. To test this hypothesis we measured the effect of several combinations of AZTTP and different NNRTIs in the presence and absence of PPi or ATP. Fig. 4 (A and B) shows the combination of AZTTP with nevirapine in the presence of PPi. When different concentrations of nevirapine were added, the IC50 values decreased (Fig. 4C). Under these conditions, the inhibition of AZTTP was similar to that obtained in the absence of PPi and nevirapine (0.20 ± 0.01 μm). It should be noted that this reduction was effectively due to a resensitization of the AZTr-RT, because the inhibition values of the polymerase activity obtained with 0.1 and 1 μm nevirapine in the presence of PPi were 1 and 15%, respectively. Furthermore, the addition of 0.1 μm nevirapine in the absence of PPi had no effect on the sensitivity of AZTr-RT to AZTTP (0.24 ± 0.01 μm), whereas 1 μm nevirapine only decreased the IC50 value to 0.16 ± 0.01 μm. These results confirm that the enhancement of the effect of AZTTP by nevirapine was not due to the additive inhibition of DNA synthesis but to the fact that nevirapine resensitizes the mutant enzyme by inhibiting the phosphorolytic reaction. This effect was not exclusive of nevirapine, because similar results were obtained with other NNRTIs, although the concentration needed to obtain this effect varied considerably. For example, in the presence of PPi, 50 nm 4-arylmethylpyridinone decreased the IC50 of AZTTP for the mutant RT from 2.3 ± 0.2 to 0.20 ± 0.02 μm. In the absence of pyrophosphate, the addition of 50 nm 4-arylmethylpyridinone had no effect on the IC50 of AZTTP (0.2 ± 0.02 μm). On the other hand, 9-Cl-TIBO was a weak inhibitor because 20 μm was needed to increase 5-fold the effect of AZT. This concentration of 9-Cl-TIBO inhibited the polymerization reaction by 15% in the presence of PPi. The Synergy of AZTTP and NNRTIs in the Inhibition of the AZT-resistant Enzyme—Because NNRTIs were able to resensitize the AZT-resistant RT to AZTTP, it was expected that their combination with AZTTP would be synergistic in the presence of ATP or PPi. To analyze the interaction of these inhibitors, we measured the inhibition"
https://openalex.org/W1972697674,"The repressive and activating states of nuclear hormone receptors are achieved through the recruitment of cofactor proteins. The binding of co-repressors and co-activators is believed to be mutually exclusive and principally regulated by ligand binding. To understand the molecular determinants of the switch induced by ligand in the retinoic acid receptor and in particular the intrinsic role of the ligand binding domain (LBD) in cofactor binding and release, we carried out extensive mutational analysis of surface residues of the LBD. As seen previously we found that co-repressor and co-activator molecules bind to overlapping docking sites on the surface of the retinoic acid receptor α LBD. Perturbation of this surface impaired both co-activator and co-repressor association resulting in a transcriptionally inert receptor. Unexpectedly mutation of two residues, Trp-225 and Ala-392, which lie outside the docking site, had opposite effects on co-activator and co-repressor binding. W225A was a constitutive repressor that failed to bind co-activator and exhibited an increased, and ligand-insensitive, interaction with co-repressor. A392R, on the other hand, had reduced affinity for co-repressors and increased affinity for co-activators and behaved as a constitutive, but still ligand-inducible, activator. Analysis of known structures showed that these mutations lie in the proximity of helix 12 (H12), and their effects are likely to be the result of perturbations in the behavior of H12. These data suggest that residues in the close vicinity of H12 regulate cofactor affinity and determine the basal activity of receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2157035384,"Porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) is a rate-limiting enzyme of the heme biosynthesis pathway, whose level is elevated in various human tumors. PBGD was observed in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of C6 glioma cells by immunostaining. During mitosis, chromatids were intensely stained for PBGD in comparison to the interphase chromatin. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified RanBPM, the nuclear Ran-binding protein, as an interacting partner of PBGD. During butyrate-induced differentiation of C6, both nuclear and cytoplasmic PBGD levels declined as did Ran protein and its nucleotide exchange factor RCC1. N,N'-hexamethylene bis-acetamide-dependent differentiation resulted in an increase of the cytoplasmic PBGD, whereas nuclear PBGD, Ran protein and RCC1 remained unchanged. mRNA levels of PBGD remained unchanged during stimulation with both butyrate and N,N'-hexamethylene bis-acetamide. The enzymatic activity of PBGD and protoporphyrin IX synthesis in C6 cells were dependent on the differentiation induction agent. We conclude that PBGD possibly has a nuclear role in addition to its cytosolic enzymatic activity required for heme synthesis, which is related to cell transformation and differentiation."

Hybrid peptides with the strongest affinity for binding to Aβ were the most effective at protecting against Aβ toxicity (24Cairo C.W. Strzelec A. Murphy R.M. Kiessling L.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8620-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We identified hybrid peptides that, when mixed with Aβ, inhibit Aβ toxicity while promoting more rapid formation of larger Aβ aggregates (21Ghanta J. Shen C.-L. Kiessling L.L. Murphy R.M. J. Biol.

If it proves to be true that intermediate oligomeric species in the Aβ aggregation pathway are the toxic species, the cytoprotection afforded by these compounds might result from their ability to reduce the concentration of toxic intermediate species. The objective of the work reported here is to identify a plausible physicochemical basis for the action of hybrid peptides in accelerating Aβ aggregation. We demonstrate a strong positive correlation between the surface tension of aqueous solutions of active compounds and the ability of these compounds to increase the rate of Aβ aggregation. This concept is used to rationally design a modified peptide with markedly enhanced activity. Peptides—Aβ-(1-40) was purchased from Anaspec, Inc. (San Jose, CA). Protected amino acids, resin, and HBTU were purchased from Novabiochem. Betaine, ethyl acetate, and piperidine were purchased from Sigma. Diisopropylethylamine was purchased from Advanced Chemtech (Louisville, KY). KKKK was purchased from Bachem, Inc. (King of Prussia, PA). All other materials were purchased from Fisher Scientific or Sigma. KLVFFKKKKKK was synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis using Fmoc-protected amino acids and purified by HPLC as described previously (26Lowe T.L. Strzelec A. Kiessling L.L. Murphy R.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7882-7889Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The dicyclohexamine salt of double Boc-protected lysine was converted to the free acid form using sulfuric acid and ethyl acetate extraction. To make the betaine-modified peptide, LVFFKKKKKK was synthesized on a Wang resin but with Mtt protection on the 6 C-terminal lysines. While still on the resin, the free acid form of double Boc-protected lysine was coupled at the N terminus in the presence of HBTU and diisopropylethylamine activators. Mttprotecting groups were cleaved using 1% trifluoroacetic acid followed by addition of piperidine. Betaine was coupled to the free amines to form an amide linkage in the presence of HBTU and diisopropylethylamine. 95% trifluoroacetic acid was added to cleave the resulting peptide from the resin and remove the Boc-protecting groups. The cleaved peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC (C4 column) using an acetonitrile/water gradient. Fractions were collected and analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry. Purified peptides were stored as lyophilized powders at -70 °C. Surface Tension—The equilibrium surface tension of peptide solutions was measured using an FTÅ200 pendant drop tensiometer (First Ten Angstroms, Portsmouth, VA). A droplet of inhibitor solution was formed at the end of a blunt, 22-gauge stainless steel needle, and the shape of the droplet was imaged. The surface tension was measured by fitting the Young-Laplace equation to the contour of drop shape once equilibrium was reached. Light Scattering—Peptide or betaine solutions were prepared by dissolving the compounds in double-filtered (0.22 μm) PBSA. Aβ was dissolved in double-filtered (0.22 μm) 8 m urea at a concentration of 2.8 mm for 10 min and then diluted into double-filtered PBSA or PBSA containing test compound, to 140 μm Aβ. All samples were at pH 7.4 and contained 0.4 m urea. Samples were quickly filtered through 0.45-μm filters directly into clean light scattering cuvettes. Dynamic light scattering data as well as average scattered intensity at 90° scattering angle were collected using a Coherent argon ion laser at 488 nm and a Malvern 4700 system, as described in more detail elsewhere (26Lowe T.L. Strzelec A. Kiessling L.L. Murphy R.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7882-7889Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Previously, we proposed a strategy for generating hybrid peptide compounds that modulate Aβ aggregation and inhibit Aβ toxicity (21Ghanta J. Shen C.-L. Kiessling L.L. Murphy R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29525-29528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Effective hybrid peptides contain an N-terminal recognition domain, KLVFF, homologous to residues 16-20 of Aβ, and a C-terminal disrupting domain, a repeat sequence of non-homologous amino acids. We observed that KLVFFKKKKKK and KLVFFEEEE, but not KLVFF or KLVFFSSSS, protected cells from Aβ toxicity (25Pallitto M.M. Ghanta J. Heinzelman P. Kiessling L.L. Murphy R.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3570-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 26Lowe T.L. Strzelec A. Kiessling L.L. Murphy R.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7882-7889Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Interestingly, protection from toxicity was accompanied invariably with an increase in the rate of aggregation of Aβ. Given that both cationic and anionic, but not polar uncharged, disrupting domains were capable of accelerating Aβ aggregation, we hypothesized that the disrupting domain acted by altering physical properties of the solvent. To test this, the surface tension of aqueous solutions of hybrid peptides (without Aβ) was measured using a pendant drop method. Compounds with charged disrupting domains increased surface tension in a concentration-dependent manner, but compounds with polar uncharged disrupting domains, or the recognition element alone with no disrupting domain, had little effect on surface tension (Table I). Increased surface tension of aqueous solutions of the hybrid peptide correlated strongly with an increased rate of aggregation of mixtures of Aβ + hybrid peptide (Fig. 1).Table IConcentration-dependent surface tension (dyne/cm) of aqueous solutions of hybrid peptides Hybrid peptides were dissolved in PBSA/0.4 m urea.

KKKK at 140 and 280 μm increased solvent surface tension to 53.9 ± 0.8 and 57 ± 1 dyne/cm, respectively, similar to that of KLVFFKKKKKK at the same concentrations (Table I), but even 420 μm KKKK had no effect on Aβ aggregation, whereas 140 μm KLVFFKKKKKK greatly accelerated Aβ aggregation (Fig. 2). These results indicate that modest increases in surface tension alone are insufficient to cause acceleration of aggregation and provide further support for the notion that the Aβ binding ability of the KLVFF recognition domain is required for activity. We reasoned that even greater acceleration of Aβ aggregation could be obtained with a KLVFF recognition element coupled to a disrupting domain that produced a greater solvent surface tension effect. To identify an appropriate candidate, we turned to the Hofmeister series, which lists ions in the order of their ability to stabilize protein folded structure (27Cacace M.G. Landau E.M. Ramsden J.J. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1997; 30: 241-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Protein structure stabilization by co-solutes correlates strongly with the ability of the co-solute to increase the surface tension of water (28Lin T.-Y. Timasheff S.N. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The Hofmeister cation series is N(CH3)4+x003E;NH2(CH3)2+x003E;NH4+x003E;K+x003E;Na+x003E;Cs+x003E;Li+x003E;Mg2+x003E;Ca2+x003E;Ba2+ , with the cations on the left classified as kosmotropes (protein structure-stabilizing, or “salting-out”) and those on the right as chaotropes (protein structure-destabilizing, or “salting-in”) (27Cacace M.G. Landau E.M. Ramsden J.J. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1997; 30: 241-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). The lysine hexamer disrupting domain of our most effective hybrid peptide reported to date, KLVFFKKKKKK, contains terminal amines that are protonated at neutral pH (- (CH2)4 -NH 3+ . We reasoned by analogy to the Hofmeister series that a side chain with a methyl-substituted terminal amine group might have enhanced activity as compared with lysine. Betaine ((CH3)3N+CH2COO-) is a naturally occurring compound that contains the requisite methyl-substituted amino group and also contains a free carboxyl group allowing facile coupling to a lysine side chain. We modified the lysine side chains in the disrupting domain using the following strategy. KLVFFKKKKKK was synthesized using standard Fmoc solid-phase synthesis techniques but with Mtt protection of the 6 C-terminal lysines and Boc protection of the N-terminal lysine. While maintaining the peptide on the resin, the Mtt groups were cleaved, and betaine was coupled to the lysine side chains via an amide linkage (Fig. 3). Cleavage from the resin produced a mixture of KLVFFKKKKKK derivatized with four, five, or six betaines, as confirmed by mass spectroscopy analysis (Fig. 3). A fraction highly enriched in the fully derivatized peptide, compound 1, was isolated by reverse-phase HPLC for further study (Fig. 3). Compound 1 was extremely water-soluble. Size-exclusion chromatographic analysis confirmed that it was monomeric in PBSA (data not shown). Pendant drop measurements of aqueous solutions of the purified compound demonstrated greatly increased surface tension as compared with KLVFFKKKKKK (Table II).Table IIComparison of concentration-dependent surface tension, (dyne/cm) of aqueous solutions of KLVFFKKKKKK and compound 1 Hybrid peptides were dissolved in PBSA/0.4 m urea.

After 4 h of aggregation, the hydrodynamic diameter of Aβ in the presence of compound 1 was more than 100-fold greater than Aβ alone(∼2300 versus ∼20 nm) and nearly 50 times greater than Aβ with KLVFFKKKKKK, which was our most active compound prior to the discovery of compound 1. Betaine at 1700 μm increased the surface tension of an aqueous solution to 61.4 ± 0.9 dyne/cm, equivalent to 140 μm compound 1, but betaine at 3400 μm had no measurable effect on Aβ aggregation kinetics (Fig. 4). These results show that surface tension can be used as a design strategy for improving activity of the disrupting domain of hybrid peptides and confirm that a specific recognition domain is required for activity. Self-association of protein into large aggregates of β-sheet structure and fibrillar morphology is a feature of a number of diseases, including the primary amyloidoses and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Many, perhaps even most, proteins and peptides can be coaxed into forming β-sheet fibrils under appropriate conditions of solvent, pH, and temperature (29Bucciantini M. Giamoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F.

Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar), Alarmingly, fibril-forming peptides and proteins appear to be toxic to a wide number of cell types (29Bucciantini M.

The end product of aggregation, the fully formed amyloid fibril, may be the primary toxic species, but recent evidence suggests that instead, it is a structured kinetic intermediate that is killing cells (2Pallitto M.M.

Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar). Indeed, our earliest studies provided the first published data, to our knowledge, linking accelerated aggregation with inhibition of toxicity (21Ghanta J. Shen C.-L. Kiessling L.L. Murphy R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29525-29528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Our observations that hybrid peptides with either anionic or cationic disrupting domains accelerate Aβ aggregation (26Lowe T.L. Strzelec A. Kiessling L.L. Murphy R.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7882-7889Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) led to the hypothesis that disrupting domains act by affecting solvent properties. In particular, an increase in surface tension of aqueous solutions by addition of co-solutes is strongly linked to changes in protein stability and protein aggregation (28Lin T.-Y. Timasheff S.N. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed that those hybrid peptides that accelerated Aβ aggregation also measurably increased the surface tension of aqueous solutions (Fig. 1). The increase in surface tension was mediated solely through the disrupting domain (Table I). We tested whether the disrupting domain alone was capable of affecting solvent properties and/or Aβ aggregation. Although a lysine tetramer at 420 μm increased the surface tension, it failed to alter Aβ aggregation kinetics. This is not surprising, given that molar concentrations (>0.1-1 m or higher) of co-solute are generally required for a sufficient change in solvent properties to produce measurable changes in protein folding and aggregation (27Cacace M.G. Landau E.M. Ramsden J.J. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1997; 30: 241-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 30Kim Y.-S. Cape S.P. Chi E. Raffen R. Wilkins-Stevens P. Stevens F.J. Manning M.C.

Chem. 2001; 382: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These encouraging results served as a basis for rational design of novel compounds with greater efficacy. We used the Hofmeister series as a guide toward selecting functional groups with strong surface tension activity. The Hofmeister series has proven to be a reasonably reliable predictor of co-solute effects on protein structure, aggregation, and activity (e.g. Ref. 32Ahmad A. Akhtar M.S. Bhakuni V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1945-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The strongest salting-out (kosmotropic) cations in the Hofmeister series are methylammonium ions (27Cacace M.G. Landau E.M. Ramsden J.J. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1997; 30: 241-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Several related compounds, such as betaine ((CH3) 3N+CH2COO-), sarcosine (CH3)H2N+CH2COO-), and trimethylamine N-oxide ((CH3)3NO), are naturally occurring intracellular solutes that regulate osmotic pressure and modulate protein folding and enzyme function (e.g. Ref. 33Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 34Ratnaparkhi G.S. Varadarajan R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1050-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These compounds also affect protein aggregation. For example, sarcosine stabilized the native conformation of the serpin α1-antitrypsin and protected against thermal inactivation and aggregation (30Kim Y.-S. Cape S.P. Chi E. Raffen R. Wilkins-Stevens P. Stevens F.J. Manning M.C. Randolph T.W. Solomon A. Carpenter J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1626-1633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Similarly, betaine partially inhibited light chain amyloid fibril formation from immunoglobulin light chain (29Bucciantini M. Giamoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddie N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar). In contrast, trimethylamine N-oxide accelerated fibril assembly from Aβ (36Yang D.-S. Yip C.M. Huang T.H.J. Chakrabartty A. Fraser P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32970-32974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This apparent contradiction can be resolved by noting that kosmotropes, through a preferential exclusion mechanism, increase the surface tension (interfacial energy per unit area) of aqueous solutions, thereby producing a thermodynamic driving force to reduce surface area to minimize interfacial energy. Thus, kosmotropes drive the system toward more compact protein structures. For α1-antitrypsin and immunoglobulin light chain, the most compact structure is the natively folded monomer, but since Aβ monomer is random coil, its most compact and folded structure is the β-sheet fibril. Given these clues, we developed a method for synthesizing hybrid peptides with terminal trimethylammonium groups in the disrupting domain. The betaine-derivatized KLVFFKKKKKK was remarkably active at increasing surface tension and was dramatically more effective at accelerating Aβ aggregation than KLVFFKKKKKK. Although betaine alone increased surface tension of aqueous solutions, the osmolyte did not measurably affect Aβ aggregation. These results indicate the specificity of the action of compound 1. It is well established that co-solutes that increase solvent surface tension favor compact folded and/or aggregated protein structures. What is unique about the compounds described here is that the increase in surface tension is apparently localized via the recognition element to the solvent near the aggregating peptides. We hypothesize that this leads to a much greater localized change in solvent surface tension than that experienced in the bulk solvent or in the absence of the recognition element. This localized change in solvent properties then drives further growth of highly aggregated species. It is interesting to speculate that similar strategies could be used as novel mechanism of targeting interfacial changes to individual proteins to influence protein folding, stability, and aggregation in a highly specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2013773716,"Glucose stimulation of pancreatic β-cells causes oscillatory influx of Ca2+, leading to pulsatile insulin secretion. We have proposed that this is due to oscillations of glycolysis and the ATP/ADP ratio, which modulate the activity of ATP-sensitive K+ channels. We show here that dihydroxyacetone, a secretagogue that feeds into glycolysis below the putative oscillator phosphofructokinase, could cause a single initial peak in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) but did not by itself cause repeated oscillations in [Ca2+]i in mouse pancreatic β-cells. However, in the presence of a substimulatory concentration of glucose (4 mm), dihydroxyacetone induced [Ca2+]i oscillations. Furthermore, these oscillations correlated with oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio, as seen previously with glucose stimulation. Insulin secretion in response to dihydroxyacetone was transient in the absence of glucose but was considerably enhanced and somewhat prolonged in the presence of a substimulatory concentration of glucose, in accordance with the enhanced [Ca2+]i response. These results are consistent with the hypothesized role of phosphofructokinase as the generator of the oscillations. Dihydroxyacetone may affect phosphofructokinase by raising the free concentration of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to a critical level at which it activates the enzyme autocatalytically, thereby inducing the pulses of phosphofructokinase activity that cause the metabolic oscillations.

Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, we have proposed that the basis of these oscillations in the pancreatic β-cell is the spontaneous oscillations of glycolysis and the ATP/ADP ratio due to pulsed action of the muscle isoform of phosphofructokinase (PFK-M), which is present in β-cells (13Yaney G.C Schultz V. Cunningham B.A. Dunaway G.A. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1285-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As demonstrated previously in muscle extracts, such oscillatory behavior can result from autocatalytic activation of PFK-M by its product, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2) (14Tornheim K. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6304-6314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Andrés V. Schultz V. Tornheim K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21441-21447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The occurrence of glycolytic oscillations in the β-cell is supported by observations of similar oscillations in [Ca2+]i, glucose 6-phosphate, and the ATP/ADP ratio (16Nilsson T. Schultz V. Berggren P.-O. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 17Deeney J.T. Köhler M. Kubik K. Brown G. Schultz V. Tornheim K. Corkey B.E. Berggren P.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36946-36950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), as well as oscillatory release of lactate from perifused islets (18Chou H.-F. Berman N. Ipp E. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: E800-E805PubMed Google Scholar). As a further test of this hypothesized role of glycolytic oscillations, we examined the actions of the trioses dihydroxyacetone (DHA) and glyceraldehyde (GA) that on phosphorylation feed into glycolysis downstream of the phosphofructokinase reaction. The trioses can also serve as secretagogues (19Hellman B. Idahl L.-Å. Lernmark Å. Sehlin J. Täljedal I.-B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 162: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Zawalich W.S. Dye E.S. Rognstad R. Matschinsky F.M. Endocrinology. 1978; 103: 2027-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Zawalich W.S. Diabetes. 1979; 28: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), though they have not been shown to cause oscillations in [Ca2+]i or insulin secretion. Of the two, GA is the more potent and the more widely studied. However, there is concern that it may not be a suitable glucose mimic in that it causes strong cellular acidification, most likely because of direct metabolism by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and perhaps phosphoglycerate kinase to produce glyceric acid (22MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We therefore focused on DHA, although some experiments were also performed with GA for comparison. Furthermore, we previously showed in the glycolyzing muscle extract system that the addition of DHA-P could trigger a pulse of PFK activity by raising the concentration of Fru-1,6-P2 into the autocatalytic range (14Tornheim K. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6304-6314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show in mouse pancreatic β-cells that DHA by itself caused only a transient rise in [Ca2+]i, if any, but not oscillations. However, in the presence of a substimulatory concentration of glucose, the addition of DHA induced oscillations in [Ca2+]i as well as corresponding oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio. The glucose dependence suggests an effect of DHA to modulate glucose metabolism as in the muscle extract system and is consistent with the proposed role of PFK-M as the generator of the oscillations in the pancreatic β-cell. Isolation and Culture of Islet Cells—Pancreatic islets were isolated from pancreata of 10–12 months old ob/ob mice (23Hellman B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1965; 131: 541-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), using a collagenase technique (24Lacy P.E. Kostianovsky M. Diabetes. 1967; 16: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar). Dispersed islet cells were prepared as described previously (25Lernmark Å. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The cell suspensions, consisting of more than 90% β-cells (26Nilsson T. Arkhammar P. Hallberg A. Hellman B. Berggren P.-O. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), were seeded onto glass coverslips. Cells were allowed to attach for about 1 h, and thereafter were submerged in RPMI 1640 medium (11 mm glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin. They were then cultured for 1–2 days. The solution used for isolation of islets and experiments contained 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the indicated concentrations of glucose. Fluorescence Measurements—With the exception of the experiments for measuring ATP/ADP ratio, which needed larger numbers of cells in suspension (see below), all fluorescence measurements were made on single small-cell aggregates consisting of about 4–10 cells each, using a Spex Fluorolog spectrofluorometer coupled to a Zeiss Axiovert 35M microscope, with a Zeiss Fluar 40×/1.2 objective and a small open perifusion chamber mounted on a thermostatically controlled stage (27Juntti-Berggren L. Civelek V.N. Berggren P.-O. Schulz V. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14391-14395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For measurements of [Ca2+]i, cells were loaded with fura-2/AM (28Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), 1 μm, for 30 min at 37 °C. When rhodamine 123 fluorescence was used as a qualitative measure of mitochondrial membrane potential (29Duchen M.R. Smith P.A. Ashcroft F.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) simultaneously with fura-2 measurements of [Ca2+]i, this probe was added at 10 μg/ml during the last 5 min of the fura-2/AM incubation. When monitoring [Ca2+]i and pHi simultaneously, the cells were loaded with fura-2/AM and BCECF/AM concomitantly for 30 min, each at a concentration of 1 μm (27Juntti-Berggren L. Civelek V.N. Berggren P.-O. Schulz V. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14391-14395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells destined for NAD(P)H measurements were preincubated 30 min in the same medium without the probes. A fura-2/BCECF filter combination (dichroic mirror 505 nm and emission bandpass 515–565 nm) was used to monitor fura-2 fluorescence separately or in combination with BCECF or rhodamine 123 fluorescence. Excitation wavelengths for fura-2 were 340/380 nm or just 380 in combination with the other probes. Both BCECF and rhodamine 123 were excited at 490 nm (29Duchen M.R. Smith P.A. Ashcroft F.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 30Juntti-Berggren L. Rorsman P. Siffert W. Berggren P-O. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The excitation intensity levels were adjusted individually at 380 and 490 nm when fura-2 was used in combination with BCECF or rhodamine 123. NAD(P)H fluorescence was monitored with an excitation wavelength of 366 nm, a dichroic mirror at 400 nm, and an emission bandpass filter at 450–470 nm (31Panten U. Ishida H. Diabetologia. 1975; 11: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Pralong W.-F. Bartley C. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Despite the resulting poor emission levels, the excitation intensity level in the NAD(P)H measurements was held similar to that used for fura-2 measurements in order to minimize phototoxicity. Some [Ca2+]i measurements were made with an attached CCD camera, which allowed the recording and scoring of individual cells in the cell clusters. ATP/ADP Ratio and [Ca2 + ] i Measurements in Cell Suspensions— These measurements were performed essentially as described previously (16Nilsson T. Schultz V. Berggren P.-O. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were loaded with fura-2 as described above and the cell suspension placed in a stirred cuvette in a Spex Fluorolog-2 system to monitor [Ca2+]i. Samples were taken and deproteinized and assayed for ATP and ADP by a bioluminometric method (33Schultz V. Sussman I. Bokvist K. Tornheim K. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 215: 302-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fru-1,6-P 2 and Triose-P Levels—Samples equivalent to 40–90 dispersed islets in 0.2 ml were deproteinized with 40 μl of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, neutralized by ether extraction, and freeze-dried (16Nilsson T. Schultz V. Berggren P.-O. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The samples were redissolved in 0.6 ml of water and assayed by enzymatic cycling methods (34Lowry O.H. Passonneau J.V. A Flexible System of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, NY1972: 168-172Google Scholar) for triose-P with and without Fru-1,6-P2 (with and without aldolase included in the initial reaction), and Fru-1,6-P2 was calculated from the difference. Because DHA was found to interfere with the assay, it was removed by anion exchange chromatography as follows. Bio-Rad AG1-X8 anion exchange resin (10 mg) in a 1-ml pipette tip was prewashed sequentially with 1 ml of H2O, 2 ml 0.1 n HCl, 1 ml H2O, 2 ml of 0.1 m triethanolamine-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, and 2 ml of 5 mm NaCl. The sample was brought to pH 8 with 1 n NaOH and diluted 4-fold with water; 2 ml was loaded on the column at a flow rate of 2 drops/min, and the DHA was washed through with 1.5 ml 5 mm NaCl. Fru-1,6-P2 and triose-P were then eluted with 0.6 ml of 0.1 n HCl, brought to pH 5–6 with 1 m triethanolamine base, and fast frozen for subsequent assay. Insulin Secretion—Secretion was measured by perifusing β-cell aggregates mixed with Bio-Gel P4 polyacrylamide beads (Bio-Rad) in a 0.5-ml column at 37 °C (35Kanatsuna T. Lernmark A. Rubenstein A.H. Steiner D.F. Diabetes. 1981; 30: 213-234Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min, and 2-min fractions were collected and analyzed for insulin by radioimmunoassay using a rat insulin standard (Novo Nordisk). Materials—Mouse collagen type IV, dihydroxyacetone, and d-glyceraldehyde were purchased from Sigma. Fura-2/AM, BCECF/AM, and rhodamine 123 were from Molecular Probes Inc. Effects of DHA and GA on [Ca2 + ] i —The ability of DHA and GA to initiate β-cell stimulation was first tested in the absence of glucose. As shown in Fig. 1, 11 mm glucose, 10 mm DHA, or 10 mm GA all produced a biphasic change in [Ca2+]i, with an initial small decrease followed immediately by a pronounced increase. Whereas GA always produced an increase in [Ca2+]i, DHA was less potent and in 30% of the experiments produced only a decrease or no change in [Ca2+]i (see also Fig. 2). Glucose (11 mm) caused an increase in [Ca2+]i that was sustained for some minutes. GA produced a similar effect in 20% of the experiments and a transient effect in the rest, whereas DHA produced only a transient increase in [Ca2+]i, if any.Fig. 2Effect of 10 mm DHA on [Ca2+]i in the absence and presence of 4 mm glucose. The substances were introduced and discontinued as indicated by the horizontal bars. The combined presence of 4 mm glucose (G) and 10 mm DHA resulted in regular oscillations in 17 of 19 cell preparations. With respect to the initial effect of DHA alone, the trace in panel A is a representative of 16 of 23 experiments, and the trace in panel B of 7 of 23 experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) With regard to the ability of glucose to produce regular oscillations in [Ca2+]i during prolonged β-cell stimulation, neither DHA nor GA alone was observed to have this effect. However, the combined presence of 4 mm glucose and 10 mm DHA produced regular oscillations in [Ca2+]i that disappeared when DHA or glucose was omitted from the perifusion medium (Fig. 2) or when mannoheptulose was added to prevent glucose metabolism (data not shown). The frequency of the oscillations was 0.23 ± 0.015 min-1 (n = 11, three peaks or more in sequence, mean ± S.E.), similar to that seen with glucose stimulation (36Larsson O. Kindmark H. Brändström R. Fredholm B. Berggren P.-O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5161-5165Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The oscillations were observed in 90% of the cell preparations in the simultaneous presence of 4 mm glucose and 10 mm DHA, and a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i was seen in the remaining preparations. GA (10 mm) could also produce oscillations in [Ca2+]i in the presence of 4 mm glucose, but this was seen less consistently, in only about 25% of the preparations (data not shown), and a sustained increase was observed in the remaining preparations. Because neither DHA nor GA by themselves evoked oscillations in [Ca2+]i, but perhaps only a single rise in [Ca2+]i, these findings may suggest that the actual mechanism responsible for the slow glucose-induced oscillations in [Ca2+]i is located upstream of the triose level, most likely at phosphofructokinase, which is a known generator of oscillations of glycolysis and the ATP/ADP ratio (12Tornheim K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a separate set of experiments, [Ca2+]i measurements were performed using CCD imaging to monitor individual cells and also to test a higher concentration of 20 mm DHA. Cells in the absence of glucose were first stimulated with DHA (20 mm) alone for 15 min, returned to a base line at 4 mm glucose, then stimulated with 10 mm DHA plus 4 mm glucose for 15 min, again returned to 4 mm glucose alone, and finally stimulated with 8 mm glucose (see Fig. 3). Of the 139 cells recorded, 27% responded to 20 mm DHA in the absence of glucose, but with only one exception, none displayed oscillations (less than 1%). We suspect this single case may have been an unusual spontaneous oscillation, which is occasionally seen in such recordings. By marked contrast, 70% of these same cells responded to 10 mm DHA in the presence of 4 mm glucose and 35% displayed clearly discernable oscillations. For comparison, 84% of the cells responded to 8 mm glucose and 65% displayed oscillations. In general, when glucose stimulated oscillations and multiple cells in a cluster were monitored, all or most (e.g. 7 of 9 and 5 of 7) of the cells oscillated. There was only a single case where just 1 cell (of 3) oscillated. The pattern of the Ca2+ response appeared similar in cells from the same cluster, more so than for cells from different clusters. Similarly, DHA plus 4 mm glucose also generally caused oscillations in all cells monitored within a cluster (9 cases), with the exception of one case where only 2 of 6 cells oscillated. When oscillations were induced by 10 mm DHA plus 4 mm glucose, then usually oscillations were subsequently exhibited in response to 8 mm glucose. These experiments further demonstrated that DHA was ineffective in causing [Ca2+]i oscillations by itself but induced oscillations when added in the presence of substimulatory glucose. DHA-induced Oscillations in the ATP/ADP Ratio—When suspensions of mouse islet cells were stimulated with 10 mm DHA in the presence of 4 mm glucose, the ATP/ADP ratio increased (Fig. 4), although to a considerably smaller extent than seen previously with high glucose (16Nilsson T. Schultz V. Berggren P.-O. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although of lower amplitude than with glucose, there were oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio corresponding to the [Ca2+]i oscillations. We attempted to measure the accumulation of Fru-1,6-P2 and triose-P using enzymatic cycling assays (34Lowry O.H. Passonneau J.V. A Flexible System of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, NY1972: 168-172Google Scholar). However, this was initially found not to be practical because of interference from the high level of DHA from the incubation medium. DHA was a poor, but nevertheless overwhelming, substrate for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in comparison with the cellular levels of DHAP and Fru-1,6-P2 in these samples. We subsequently tried batch incubations of larger amounts of material in 4 or 8 mm glucose for 10 min or 4 mm glucose plus 10 mm DHA for 10 or 13 min, utilizing anion exchange chromatography to remove the interfering DHA. At 4 mm glucose, the Fru-1,6-P2 level was 0.55 ± 0.11 pmol/islet (mean ± S.E., n = 3), or 50 μm, calculated assuming 1.1 pl/cell and 10,000 cells in an ob/ob mouse islet (37Webb D.L. Islam M.S. Efanov A.M. Brown B. Köhler M. Larsson O. Berggren P.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19074-19079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). With DHA, the Fru-1,6-P2 concentration if anything may have decreased somewhat, to 28 ± 8 μm at 10 min and about the same at 13 min; this was similar to the concentration in the presence of 8 mm glucose, 32 ± 12 μm. These Fru-1,6-P2 concentrations would probably be nearly saturating for activation of PFK-M (13Yaney G.C Schultz V. Cunningham B.A. Dunaway G.A. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1285-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 38Tornheim K. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7322-7328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the triose-P concentration of 41 ± 5 μm at 4 mm glucose most likely indicates a much lower free concentration of Fru-1,6-P2 of 0.7 ± 0.2 μm, based on equilibration of the triose-phosphate isomerase and aldolase reactions (see “Discussion”). Calculated free concentrations of Fru-1,6-P2 varied considerably after 10 or 13 min of incubation with DHA, ranging from 26 to 364% of the values in 4 mm glucose alone. Effects of DHA ± Substimulatory Glucose on Insulin Secretion—The addition of 10 mm DHA to perifused islets in the absence of glucose caused a small transient release of insulin (Fig. 5). However, the addition of DHA in the presence of 4 mm glucose, which in itself was not stimulatory, caused substantially more insulin release. Most of this was in the initial peak, which was about five times greater than in the absence of glucose. The initial peak was followed by a slightly elevated plateau. When high (11 mm) glucose (without DHA) was added after DHA at 0 mm glucose, there was a large initial peak and an elevated plateau (Fig. 5) similar to the behavior seen in other experiments without an intervening interval of DHA (data not shown). Interestingly, when high glucose was added after DHA at 4 mm glucose, the initial peak response was lost, although a similar elevated plateau was maintained. Effects of DHA and GA on Mitochondrial Membrane Potential, NAD(P)H Fluorescence and pH i —To examine the effects of the trioses on mitochondrial energetics, rhodamine 123 and fura-2 were used simultaneously to monitor mitochondrial membrane potential and [Ca2+]i. A decrease in rhodamine 123 fluorescence, indicative of mitochondrial hyperpolarization (29Duchen M.R. Smith P.A. Ashcroft F.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), preceded the glucose-induced increase in [Ca2+]i by 51 ± 9 s (mean ± S.E., n = 7) (Fig. 6A). DHA and GA, in the absence of glucose, also caused mitochondrial hyperpolarization (Fig. 6, B and C). In the case of GA the time delay between mitochondrial hyperpolarization and the increase in [Ca2+]i was 52 ± 7 s (mean ± S.E., n = 5). However, in these experiments with DHA, no increase in [Ca2+]i was detected in four of five attempts, and the lag time from mitochondrial hyperpolarization to the Ca2+ increase in the remaining experiment was prolonged (252 s). In the four experiments in which DHA by itself did not cause an increase in [Ca2+]i, subsequent introduction of 4 mm glucose gave a further small mitochondrial hyperpolarization, and 40 ± 8 s (mean ± S.E., n = 4) later an increase in [Ca2+]i was observed. The reason for observing no increase, or a much delayed increase, in [Ca2+]i by DHA in these experiments is not clear but is consistent with the fact that 10 mm DHA alone, in the previous experiments, did not always cause a rise in [Ca2+]i. NAD(P)H fluorescence largely reflects mitochondrial NADH, because of the enhancement by mitochondrial enzymes (39Avi-Dor Y. Olson J.M. Doherty M.D. Kaplan N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 2377-2383Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). β-Cell NAD(P)H fluorescence was found to increase by about 20% subsequent to stimulation with 11 mm glucose, an effect similar to that described previously (31Panten U. Ishida H. Diabetologia. 1975; 11: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Both 10 mm DHA and 10 mm GA failed to produce a detectable increase in NAD(P)H fluorescence (Fig. 7). When pHi was monitored simultaneously with [Ca2+]i, glucose and DHA both produced a biphasic change in pHi with an initial increase preceding the increase in [Ca2+]i followed by a decrease (Fig. 8, A and B). The time delays between the pH decrease and the preceding [Ca2+]i increase were 48 ± 7 s (mean ± S.E., n = 5) for glucose and 44 ± 5 s (n = 6) for DHA. It can be noted that DHA by itself produced an increase in [Ca2+]i in all experiments in this series. In the case of GA (Fig. 8C), only a major decrease in pHi was observed. In contradistinction to the effects of glucose and DHA, this decrease in pHi preceded the increase in [Ca2+]i by 45 ± 22 s (n = 6). The studies presented here show that DHA, which feeds into glycolysis downstream of the phosphofructokinase step, did not by itself cause oscillations in [Ca2+]i in mouse β-cells. However, it could induce [Ca2+]i oscillations when added in the presence of a substimulatory concentration of glucose. These [Ca2+]i oscillations correlated with oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio (Fig. 4), as shown previously for glucose stimulation (16Nilsson T. Schultz V. Berggren P.-O. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting a similar metabolic basis. A likely explanation for this action of DHA is suggested by earlier experiments with the glycolyzing muscle extract system. We demonstrated that oscillations in the muscle extract were caused by repeated bursts of PFK-M activity and that a burst began when Fru-1,6-P2 accumulated to a critical level of about 1 μm and began to activate the enzyme autocatalytically (14Tornheim K. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6304-6314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, because DHA-P is in equilibrium with Fru-1,6-P2 through the triose-phosphate isomerase and aldolase reactions, it was found that the addition of DHA-P could trigger an early oscillation if the amount added was sufficient to raise the Fru-1,6-P2 concentration to that critical level (14Tornheim K. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6304-6314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiments with β-cells presented here, addition of DHA may have had a similarβ effect after phosphorylation to DHA-P, by raising the concentration of Fru-1,6-P2 to the critical level to trigger bursts of PFK activity and thus oscillations of glycolysis and the ATP/ADP ratio. This, of course, would occur only in the presence of some glucose to provide substrate for PFK. We were unable to demonstrate a rise in Fru-1,6-P2 with DHA added in the presence of 4 mm glucose. Furthermore, the assayed concentrations of 30–50 μm Fru-1,6-P2 are well above the level necessary to begin to activate PFK-M. However, this does not negate the above explanation, because of several practical considerations. First, it is the free concentration of Fru-1,6-P2 that would be important in the regulation of PFK-M, but it is the total concentration that is assayed. In other tissues studied previously, up to 99% of the Fru-1,6-P2 appeared to be bound (14Tornheim K. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6304-6314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Tornheim K. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7322-7328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, in the islet cells, the free Fru-1,6-P2 concentration that would be in equilibrium with the assayed triose-P levels may be calculated to be about 0.7 μm in the presence of 4 mm glucose, using values of 28 and 90 μm for the triose-phosphate isomerase and aldolase equilibrium constants, respectively (40Lowry O.H. Passonneau J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 31-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second complicating factor is that the level of a metabolite varies in an oscillating system, sometimes upward and sometimes downward. This may be part of the reason that the level of Fru-1,6-P2 appeared to decrease sometimes in these samples taken 10 or 13 min after stimulation with DHA or glucose. Furthermore, as shown in the muscle extract system, the average Fru-1,6-P2 concentration may be much larger than the trigger level of Fru-1,6-P2 needed to start autocatalytic activation (14Tornheim K. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6304-6314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DHA added in the presence of substimulatory (4 mm) glucose caused substantially more insulin secretion than when added in the absence of glucose (Fig. 5). The oscillations in [Ca2+]i induced by DHA in the presence of substimulatory glucose (Figs. 2 and 3) amounted to a prolonged increase in average [Ca2+]i, similar to that seen with high glucose, and this probably accounted for the increase in insulin secretion under these conditions. Nevertheless, DHA was still less effective than high glucose, which suggests that the magnitude of the secretory response is in part dependent on other factors normally produced by high glucose, such as lipid signaling molecules (11Prentki M. Tornheim K. Corkey B.E. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: S32-S41Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of DHA in the presence of 4 mm glucose appeared to prevent the initial high peak of insulin release on subsequent stimulation with high glucose, which perhaps indicates that DHA may be less effective than glucose in replenishing the releasable pool of granules. There have been few previous studies of DHA stimulation of secretion, with somewhat differing results. Zawalich et al. (20Zawalich W.S. Dye E.S. Rognstad R. Matschinsky F.M.

Diabetes. 1979; 28: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) reported maximal stimulation of second phase secretion in perifused rat islets at 20 mm DHA, with half-maximal stimulation at 5 mm and near maximal by 10 mm, similar to the results of Hellman et al. (19Hellman B. Idahl L.-Å. Lernmark Å. Sehlin J. Täljedal I.-B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 162: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) for batch incubated ob/ob mouse islets. Some stimulation by DHA of human islets (41Grant A.M. Christie M.R. Ashcroft S.J.H. Diabetologia. 1980; 19: 114-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and clonal β-cells (HIT) (42Meglasson M.D. Manning C.D. Najafi H. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1987; 36: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) has also been observed. On the other hand, several groups have reported no stimulation by DHA of batch-incubated rat islets in the absence of glucose (43Malaisse W.J. Herchuelz A. Levy J. Sener A. Pipeleers D.G. Devis G. Somers G. Obberghen E.V. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1975; 4: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 44Tsuura Y. Ishida H. Okamoto Y. Kato S. Horie M. Ikeda H. Seino Y.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, one of these studies (44Tsuura Y. Ishida H. Okamoto Y. Kato S. Horie M. Ikeda H. Seino Y. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) reported a doubling of basal secretion when DHA (5–10 mm) was added together with low (2.8 mm) glucose. These latter reports seem more similar to our observations. As noted by Zawalich (21Zawalich W.S. Diabetes. 1979; 28: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), differences in the metabolic state of the animal and in the islet preparation and study protocols may be responsible for some of these differing results. Glucose, DHA, and GA could all cause marked effects on mitochondrial metabolism, as indicated by the measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential, before the appearance of an increase in [Ca2+]i. This has previously been inferred for glucose from parallel measurements of [Ca2+]i and rhodamine 123 fluorescence (29Duchen M.R. Smith P.A. Ashcroft F.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and was demonstrated recently with simultaneous measurements (46Kindmark H. Köhler M. Brown G. Bränström R. Larsson O. Berggren P.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34530-34536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but it not shown previously for DHA and GA. However, in contrast to glucose, neither DHA nor GA produced a detectable increase in NAD(P)H. A possible explanation in the case of GA comes from the suggestion that GA may be oxidized directly by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to produce cytosolic NADH, which is reoxidized via the glycerol phosphate shuttle, feeding into the electron transport chain downstream from mitochondrial NADH (22MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As noted above, NAD(P)H fluorescence measurements largely reflect mitochondrial NADH. The presently observed timing and sequence of changes in pHi and [Ca2+]i upon the addition of glucose are similar to previous reports in which both parameters were measured simultaneously (27Juntti-Berggren L. Civelek V.N. Berggren P.-O. Schulz V. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14391-14395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or in parallel (47Salgado A.P. Silva A.M. Santos R.M. Rosario L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8738-8746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The glucose-induced changes in pHi may affect various components of the stimulus-secretion coupling mechanism (27Juntti-Berggren L. Civelek V.N. Berggren P.-O. Schulz V. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14391-14395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but they can also serve as indicators of underlying metabolic or ionic fluxes. We showed previously that the initial rise in pHi could be blocked by the mitochondrial pyruvate transport inhibitor 3-hydroxycyanocinnamate, without affecting the subsequent Ca2+ signal (27Juntti-Berggren L. Civelek V.N. Berggren P.-O. Schulz V. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14391-14395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This indicated that the alkalinization was most likely due to enhanced mitochondrial metabolism of pyruvate, probably in response to the ATP usage in the initial glucose phosphorylation(s). The alkalinization seen here with DHA may therefore be a reflection of its phosphorylation. Glucose and DHA caused a subsequent decrease in pHi, perhaps due to glycolytic acid (pyruvate) production or activation of H+/Ca2+ exchange by the increase in [Ca2+]i (47Salgado A.P. Silva A.M. Santos R.M. Rosario L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8738-8746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In contrast to the actions of glucose and DHA, GA caused only a strong and early acidification. It is clear from the present data that the mechanism behind the decrease in pHi induced by GA is different from the one caused by glucose and DHA and not secondary to Ca2+ influx because it preceded the increase in [Ca2+]i. The lowering effect of GA on pHi may be due to the accumulation of acidic metabolites such as glycerate, a property that could explain its cytotoxic effects in pancreatic islets after overnight culture (22MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For these reasons and other possible interfering effects of the acidification (see below), GA may be less suitable for metabolic studies of fuel stimulus-secretion coupling. The acidification by GA and alkalinization by DHA have been reported previously (30Juntti-Berggren L. Rorsman P. Siffert W. Berggren P-O. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 48Arkhammar P. Berggren P.-O. Rorsman P. Biosci. Rep. 1986; 6: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 49Davies J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7915-7921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but here the changes in pHi and [Ca2+]i have been measured simultaneously for the trioses. In these studies GA was much less consistent than DHA in inducing oscillations in [Ca2+]i in the presence of glucose. This may be due to the GA-induced drop in pHi, which may have effects such as closure of KATP channels (48Arkhammar P. Berggren P.-O. Rorsman P. Biosci. Rep. 1986; 6: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 51Cook D.L. Hales C.N. Nature. 1984; 311: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 52Misler S. Gillis K. Tabcharani J. J.

Physiol. 1986; 48: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) (which may be important for electrical coupling to promote oscillatory behavior), and inhibition of PFK-M, the putative generator of the oscillations, because the enzyme has been shown to be extremely pH-sensitive (53Busa W.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 54Trivedi B. Danforth W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 4110-4112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, we previously showed in the glycolyzing muscle extract system that differences in the initial pH of 0.1 unit or less could greatly affect the time of initiation and the period of the oscillations (55Tornheim K. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2670-2677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, since the present studies were done, Lenzen et al. (56Lenzen S. Lerch M. Peckmann T. Tiedge M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1523: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have reported the induction of [Ca2+]i oscillations in mouse islets by GA in the presence but not in the absence of 5 mm glucose. The results of these studies are consistent with our hypothesis that PFK-M is the generator of the oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W2007619482,"Viral infection modulates the regulation of apoptosis in host cells. Here, we report a novel mechanism by which human cells infected with mumps virus become susceptible to apoptosis caused by extracellular stresses. Mumps virus stimulates proteasome-dependent degradation of STAT-1 by action of viral accessory protein V, resulting in a severe decrease in STAT-1 protein in infected cells. We exposed mumps virus-infected and uninfected cells to heat and chemical stress. The infected cells failed to acquire resistance to apoptotic stimuli (thermotolerance) after exposure to these mild stresses. The induction of HSP27 by stress exposure was dramatically suppressed in the infected cells, but HSP70 induction was not affected. STAT-1 was required for transcriptional activation of the HSP27 gene, but not for the HSP70 gene, and cDNA transfection of STAT-1 in mumps virus-infected cells restored thermotolerance. Phosphorylated heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1) and STAT-1 phosphorylated on neither tyrosine nor serine residues were co-transported to the nucleus in response to stress. Furthermore, overexpression of unphosphorylatable mutants of STAT-1 also restored thermotolerance in mumps virus-infected cells. These lines of evidence indicate that the induction of HSP27 by stress requires STAT-1 in addition to the activated HSF-1. Furthermore, STAT-1 required for the induction of HSP27 worked independent to its phosphorylation. Thus, HSP27-dependent thermotolerance is suppressed by mumps virus infection through the destruction of STAT-1. The lack of thermotolerance should allow the infected cells to be eliminated by apoptosis and might be a host defense against viral infection.

To protect against viral infection, the host makes every effort to prevent viral replication and dissemination. The induction of cell death in virus-infected cells represents an effective host defense mechanism to eliminate the infected cells.

One is the establishment of an antiviral state, which is achieved through translational suppression of protein synthesis by the action of 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase and double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) (1Fujii N. Müller W.E.G. Schröder H.C. Progress in Molecular and Subcellular Biology. Vol. 14. Springer-Verlag, Berlin-Heidelberg1994: 150-175Google Scholar, 2Samuel C.E.

Another role is the facilitation of cell death (4Barber G.N. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Many IFN-induced gene products, such as PKR, TRAIL (tumor-necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), Fas (CD95/APO1), and IRFs (interferon regulatory factors), are also known to be mediators of apoptosis (4Barber G.N. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 5Battle T.E. Frank D.A. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells infected with virus are rapidly eliminated by phagocytes such as macrophage and dendritic cells, and the phagocytosed virus is digested and carried into antigen presentation (6Albert M.L. Sauter B. Bhardwaj N. Nature. 1998; 392: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2032) Google Scholar, 7Fujimoto I. Pan J. Takizawa T. Nakanishi Y. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3399-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). On the other hand, viruses suppress host defense mechanisms including the action of IFN by various strategies (8Alcami A. Koszinowski U.H. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 447-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 9Goodbourn S. Didcock L. Randall R.E. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2341-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). The IFN signaling pathways have been well characterized as have those of various cytokines (10Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5014) Google Scholar, 11Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). Janus kinases (JAKs), which associate with certain IFN receptors, are activated when IFN binds to the specific receptors. The activated JAKs Tyr-phosphorylate and thereby activate a family of transcription factors named signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT). After stimulation with type I IFN, namely IFN-α or IFN-β, the transcription factor forms a complex called ISGF3, which consists of Tyr-phosphorylated STAT-1, Tyr-phosphorylated STAT-2, and IRF9/p48/ISGF3γ. This complex then binds to the IFN-stimulated response element in the IFN-inducible gene promoter. After stimulation with IFN-γ, γ-activated factor, which is a dimer of phosphorylated STAT-1, binds to the γ activation sequence. Many viruses, for example those belonging to family Paramyxoviridae (12Gotoh B. Komatsu T. Takeuchi K. Yokoo J. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 45: 787-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 13Gotoh B. Komatsu T. Takeuchi K. Yokoo J. Rev. Med. Virol. 2002; 12: 337-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), are reported to shut off or suppress the IFN signaling pathway (8Alcami A. Koszinowski U.H. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 447-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 9Goodbourn S. Didcock L. Randall R.E. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2341-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Viruses belonging to the genus Respirovirus within the family Paramyxoviridae, such as Sendai virus and human parainfluenza virus type 3, reduce the Tyr phosphorylation of STAT-1 (14Gao J. De B.P. Han Y. Choudhary S. Ransohoff R. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1124-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 15Garcin D. Latorre P. Kolakofsky D. J.

More recently, we showed that the measles virus, a Morbillivirus, inhibits the Tyr phosphorylation of Jak1 induced by IFN-α, but not that induced by IFN-γ (18Yokota S. Saito H. Kubota T. Yokosawa N. Amano K. Fujii N. Virology. 2003; 306: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Viruses belonging to the genus Rubulavirus have been shown to dramatically reduce the basal level of STAT proteins. Mumps virus and simian virus 5 accelerate the degradation of STAT-1 protein in a proteasome-dependent manner (19Didcock L. Young D.F. Goodbourn S. Randall R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9928-9933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kubota T. Yokosawa N. Yokota S. Fujii N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Human parainfluenza virus type 2 reduces STAT-2 protein levels (22Nishio M. Tsurudome M. Ito M. Kawano M. Komada H. Ito Y. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9165-9176Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 23Parisien J.P. Lau J.F. Rodriguez J.J. Sullivan B.M. Moscona A. Parks G.D. Lamb R.A. Horvath C.M. Virology. 2001; 283: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Accelerated degradation of STAT-1 by mumps virus is necessary and sufficient for the expression of viral accessory protein V (20Kubota T. Yokosawa N. Yokota S. Fujii N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 21Yokosawa N. Yokota S. Kubota T. Fujii N. J.

These STAT proteins act as transcription factors for IFN-inducible genes, so that the decrease in the proteins leads not only to a reduction of the antiviral state but also to other IFN-induced cellular responses. In fact, we reported that augmentation of apoptosis by IFN is diminished in mumps virus-infected cells (25Hariya Y. Shirakawa S. Yonekura N. Yokosawa N. Kohama G. Fujii N. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 26Hariya Y. Yokosawa N. Yonekura N. Kohama G. Fuji N. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 44: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This suppression of apoptosis is also considered to be a mechanism by which the virus can escape from the host defense, because induction of apoptosis is a strategy that host cells use to eliminate infected virus. In this report, we show a novel mechanism that mumps virus-infected cells use to fight infection. Infected cells do not acquire thermotolerance and easily undergo apoptosis by stress. This phenomenon probably developed as a measure to counteract the inhibition of IFN-induced apoptosis by the action of the virus. Thermotolerance is a form of resistance to cell death acquired after exposure to mild, nonlethal, extracellular stresses (27Gerner E.W. Schneider M.J. Nature. 1975; 256: 500-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 28Henle K.J. Dethlefsen L.A. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 1843-1851PubMed Google Scholar). On the molecular level, the induction of a series of heat shock proteins (HSPs) is involved in the development of thermotorlerance (29Landry J. Bernier D. Chretien P. Nicole L.M. Tanguay R.M. Marceau N. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 2457-2461PubMed Google Scholar, 30Li G.C. Li L.G. Liu Y.K. Mak J.Y. Chen L.L. Lee W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Radiol. 1982; 55: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Most HSPs, also called stress proteins, act as molecular chaperones, which assist in folding newly synthesized proteins and denatured proteins formed by stress. HSPs consume ATP as an energy source to fold proteins (33Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3116) Google Scholar). Some HSPs, such as HSP70 and HSP27, are also known to be suppressors of cell death including apoptosis (34Creagh E.M. Sheehan D. Cotter T.G. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1161-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 35Samali A. Orrenius S. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 36Xanthoudakis S. Nicholson D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E163-E165Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The suppressive activity of the stress-induced HSPs give rise to thermotolerance. Here, we investigated whether the lack of thermotolerance in mumps-virus infected cells is related to HSP27 induction. We found that expression of HSP27 was STAT-1-dependent, so that the induction of HSP27 disappeared in mumps virus-infected cells lacking STAT-1. Cells and Viruses—The human oral squamous cell carcinoma lines, OSC19 and OSC70, and the stable transformant clones of OSC70 overexpressing human HSP27 were described previously (37Yonekura N. Yokosawa N. Hariya Y. Dehari H. Kohama G. Fujii N. Tumor Res. 2000; 35: 25-33Google Scholar, 38Yonekura N. Yokota S. Yonekura K. Dehari H. Arata S. Kohama G. Fujii N.

Stark (The Cleveland Clinic Foundation). These cells were maintained as described elsewhere (39McKendry R. John J. Flavell D. Muller M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, OSC19 and OSC70 cells, infected with mumps virus vaccine strain Torii at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1, were cultured and passaged every 5 or 7 days. Persistent infection in cells was confirmed by virus titer in the culture supernatant, and viral V protein expression in cells was determined by Western blotting. Antibodies and Reagents—Mouse monoclonal antibodies against HSP27 (clone G3.1) and HSP70 (C92F3A-5) were purchased from StressGen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Rabbit antibodies against HSF-1, STAT-1, phospho-STAT-1 (Tyr-701) and phospho-STAT-1 (Ser-727) were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem, Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), and Upstate (Charlottesville, VA), respectively. The rabbit anti-mumps virus V protein antibody was kindly donated by Dr Atsushi Kato (National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan). Human recombinant IFN-γ was purchased from Genzyme-Techne (Minneapolis, MN) and used at a concentration of 1000 IU/ml. The rabbit anti-FLAG tag antibody, (S)-(+)-camptothecin, and l-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (AZC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Unless otherwise mentioned, camptothecin was used at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. Cell Viability—Cell viability was determined by a gentian violet dye binding assay as previously described (20Kubota T. Yokosawa N. Yokota S. Fujii N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The binding dye was solubilized by 2-methoxyethanol, and absorbance at 595 nm was measured. Viability was also measured with a modified 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay using a Cell Counting Kit 8 (Dojin Chemical, Kumamoto, Japan) Stress Experiments—Cells were exposed to stress by two methods, exposure to heat shock and treatment with a proline analogue, AZC. For heat shock experiments, the culture flasks were exposed to 42 °C for 1 h, and then the cells were cultured under normal conditions for recovery from stress. For chemical stress experiments, cells were treated with 10 mm AZC for 2 h (43Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. Kubota H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1658-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). After the removal of AZC, the cells were cultured under normal conditions for recovery. Transient Transfection of STAT-1 and Its Unphosphorylatable Mutants—The expression plasmid for STAT-1 (pCI-neo-Flag-STAT-1) was described previously (21Yokosawa N. Yokota S. Kubota T. Fujii N. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12683-12690Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids containing mutants STAT-1 (STAT-1-Y701F, STAT-1-Y701E, and STAT-1-S727A) were prepared using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmids (0.3 or 1 μg/105 cells) were transfected using Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were exposed to 10 mm AZC for 2 h and then cultured for 5 h under normal conditions. The resulting cells were treated with 5 μg/ml camptothecin for 16 h, and then cell viability was measured as described above. Western Blotting—SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were carried out as described previously (44Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. Kubota H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37070-37078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 45Yokota S. Yokosawa N. Kubota T. Suzutani T. Yoshida I. Miura S. Jimbow K. Fujii N. Virology. 2001; 286: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Reporter Assay with Luciferase—The human hsp27 promoter was kindly donated by Dr. L. A. Weber (University of Nevada). The human hsp27 promoter (–762 to –12), which was obtained from pKSm vector (38Yonekura N. Yokota S. Yonekura K. Dehari H. Arata S. Kohama G. Fujii N. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and the human hsp70b promoter, which was obtained from the pD3SX vector (StressGen), were inserted into pGL3-basic luciferase reporter vectors harboring firefly luciferase (Promega). The luciferase plasmid and reference plasmid pRL-SV40 (Promega), which was used as a control for transfection efficacy, were co-transfected into cells using the Superfect reagent. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were further incubated with 1 h under heat shock (42 °C) and then 4 h under normal conditions, 1 h normal conditions and then 4 h of IFN-γ treatment, or 1 h heat shock and then 4 h of IFN-γ treatment. The experiments were carried out in triplicate. The cells were lysed, and luciferase activity in the lysate was assessed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Reporter activity was calculated as the ratio of firefly luciferase activity to Renilla luciferase activity. The results are expressed as -fold induction relative to the value of the untreated control. Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (18Yokota S. Saito H. Kubota T. Yokosawa N. Amano K. Fujii N. Virology. 2003; 306: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 45Yokota S. Yokosawa N. Kubota T. Suzutani T. Yoshida I. Miura S. Jimbow K. Fujii N. Virology. 2001; 286: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5). The cell lysate and appropriate antibody (1 μg) were incubated together, and then the complex containing the antibody was precipitated by protein G-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The resin was washed with radioimmune precipitation buffer three times, and the bound materials were eluted by boiling with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Extraction of Nuclear Fraction—Nuclear fractions were prepared using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Pierce). Stress Does Not Induce Thermotolerance or HSP27 Expression in Mumps Virus-infected Cells—We examined the ability of stress to induce an anti-apoptotic state in cells infected with mumps virus (Fig. 1). The heat shock response was induced by incubation at 42 °C for 1 h followed by recovery cultivation at 37 °C for 5 h. The chemical stress response was induced by treatment with 10 mm AZC for 2 h followed by recovery cultivation at 37 °C for 5 h. OSC19 and OSC70 cells were significantly (p < 0.01) resistant to camptothecin-induced apoptosis after recovery from stress. However, mumps virus-infected OSC19 (OSC19-MP) and OSC70 (OSC70-MP) cells did not show altered sensitivity to camptothecin after stress (Fig. 1, A and C). Protein levels of HSPs during the stress response in the cells with or without mumps virus infection were determined by Western blotting. HSP70 was faintly induced after chemical stress in both infected and uninfected OSC19 cells. On the other hand, HSP27 was induced by chemical stress with AZC in the uninfected OSC19 cells but not in the mumps virus-infected cells (Fig. 1B). Both HSP27 and HSP70 were induced in OSC70 cells during the recovery period after heat shock. However, the level of HSP27 did not change significantly in mumps virus-infected cells (OSC70-MP) (Fig. 1D), whereas the level of HSP70 was increased by heat shock in the infected cells. These results suggest that the response of HSP27 to stress is suppressed in mumps-virus infected cells, but that of HSP70 is not. The lack of thermotolerance should be due to suppression of HSP27 inducibility. Recombinant OSC70 clones stably overexpressing HSP27 were resistant to camptothecin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1, E and F). Not only the HSP27 levels but also cell viability after camptothecin treatment in the clones were similar to those in OSC70 cells after heat shock (Fig. 1, C to F). The results support the induction of HSP27 as a main contributor to thermotolerance in OSC19 and OSC70 cells. Exogenous STAT-1 Expression Restores Thermotolerance and HSP27 Induction—Previously, we reported that STAT-1 protein expression diminishes or dramatically decreases in mumps virus-infected cells (21Yokosawa N. Yokota S. Kubota T. Fujii N. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12683-12690Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 46Yokosawa N. Kubota T. Fujii N. Arch. Virol. 1998; 143: 1985-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Mumps virus accessory protein V accelerates the proteasome-dependent degradation of STAT-1 (21Yokosawa N. Yokota S. Kubota T. Fujii N. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12683-12690Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 21Yokosawa N. Yokota S. Kubota T. Fujii N. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12683-12690Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the contribution of STAT-1 to the lack of thermotolerance and HSP27 induction in infected cells. OSC19-MP cells transfected with a STAT-1 expression plasmid expressed about 50% of the amount of STAT-1 protein in uninfected OSC19 cells (Fig. 2A). The STAT-1 expression in OSC19-MP also restored the stress-induced resistance to apoptosis (Fig. 2B) and the inducibility of HSP27 (Fig. 2C). The induction of HSP70 was not affected. Uninfected OSC19 cells overexpressing STAT-1 showed similar inducibility of HSP27 and HSP70 by the stress compared with OSC19 cells transfected with plasmids. The mumps virus may therefore suppress HSP27-related thermotolerance through degradation of STAT-1. STAT-1 Is Necessary for Transcriptional Activation of HSP27—To reveal the contribution of STAT-1 to HSP27 expression, a luciferase reporter assay was carried out using 2fTGH cells and the STAT-1-deficient mutant U3A cells derived from them. Although the hsp27 promoter was activated about 4-fold by heat shock in 2fTGH cells, its activation was dramatically suppressed in the STAT-1-deficient U3A cells (Fig. 3). IFN-γ treatment did not affect basal or heat shock-induced hsp27 promoter activity in either cell type. In contrast, the hsp70 promoter was strongly activated by heat shock in both cell types. However, there was ∼30% less hsp70 promoter activity in response to heat shock induction in U3A cells than in 2fTGH cells. The hsp70 promoter was activated by IFN-γ treatment compared with basal activity in both cell types; however, the promoter activity induced by heat shock was significantly suppressed by IFN-γ treatment. Neither Tyr nor Ser Phosphorylation of STAT-1 Is Necessary for HSP27 Induction—STAT-1 and HSF-1 are activated by Tyr phosphorylation induced by IFN and stress, respectively. We determined the activation status of STAT-1 by Western blotting using specific antibodies against the phosphorylated forms of STAT-1. The phosphorylated forms of HSF-1 were detected as slower migrating bands compared with unphosphorylated HSF-1. HSF-1 was phosphorylated by heat shock but not by IFN-γ in OSC19, OSC19-MP, and OSC19-MP expressing STAT-1 (Fig. 4A). STAT-1 was phosphorylated on the Tyr-701 residue by IFN-γ but not by heat shock in OSC19 cells and OSC19-MP expressing STAT-1. STAT-1 that was Tyr-phosphorylated by IFN-γ treatment translocated into the nucleus (Fig. 4C). STAT-1 phosphorylation on the Ser-727 residue occurred strongly following heat shock and weakly following IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 4A); and the Ser-phosphorylated STAT-1 was retained in the cytosol but did not translocate into the nucleus (Fig. 4C). Immunoprecipitation analysis using an anti-HSF-1 antibody revealed that STAT-1 interacted with HSF-1 in OSC19 cells (Fig. 4B). However, neither Tyr- nor Ser-phosphorylated STAT-1 was observed in the precipitates obtained with the anti-HSF-1 antibody. The interaction with STAT-1 was not affected by heat shock (and therefore by phosphorylation of HSF-1) or IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, Western blotting of nuclear extracts showed that the phosphorylated HSF-1 clearly translocated into the nucleus in OSC19 and OSC19-MP cells (Fig. 4, C and D). Interestingly, unphosphorylated STAT-1 co-translocated with phosphorylated HSF-1 into the nucleus in OSC19 cells. These lines of evidence suggest that STAT-1, but neither the Tyr- nor the Ser-phosphorylated form, is necessary for the transcriptional induction of HSP27 by stress. We then examined whether phosphorylation of STAT-1 would affect the induction of thermotolerance by using STAT-1-unphosphorylatable mutants. Expression plasmids encoding wild-type STAT-1, the unphosphorylatable dominant-negative mutants Y701F and S727A, or the constitutively active mutant Y710E were transfected into OSC19 and OSC19-MP. Induction of thermotolerance in OSC19 cells was not affected by expression of exogenous wild-type STAT-1, the unphosphorylatable dominant negative mutants, or the constitutively active mutant (Fig. 5, upper panel). Protein levels of HSP27 and HSP70 were increased 2.2–3.5-fold and 1.1–1.3-fold, respectively, after recovery from the AZC stress. OSC19-MP cells transfected with a control plasmid did not display thermotolerance or HSP27 induction during recovery culture from stress. However, overexpression of the unphosphorylatable STAT-1 mutants in OSC19-MP cells restored up-regulation of HSP27 (1.9–2.8-fold compared with untreated cells) and thermotolerance after recovery from AZC stress to a similar extent as OSC19 cells and wild-type STAT-1-overexpressing OSC19-MP cells (Fig. 5, lower panel). On the other hand, HSP70 upregulated by stress in OSC19-MP cells transfected with plasmid containing STAT-1 and its unphosphorylatable mutants (1.3–1.7-fold) did not show a significant difference compared with cells transfected with the control plasmid (1.4-fold). These findings suggest that phosphorylation on neither the Tyr nor Ser residues of STAT-1 is necessary for the induction of HSP27 as a stress response.Fig. 5Induction of thermotolerance in OSC19 and OSC19-MP cells transfected with expression vectors encoding wild-type STAT-1 or STAT-1 Tyr-701 and Ser-727 unphosphorylatable mutants. Plasmids expressing wild-type STAT-1 (wt), STAT-1-Y701F, STAT-1-Y701E, or STAT-1-S727A (0.3 or 1 μg/105 cells), or control plasmids (mock) were transfected into OSC19 and OSC19-MP cells. The STAT-1 plasmid and its mutants carry FLAG tags. After transfection for 24 h, cells were treated with 10 mm AZC for 2 h and then cultured in normal medium for 5 h. The treated cells were treated with 5 μg/ml camptothecin for 16 h. Cell viability was determined by gentian violet dye staining. The HSP protein levels were determined by Western blotting. The expression of STAT-1 and its mutants was determined by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG tag antibody. Actin levels were determined as a control for protein loading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the present study, we found that oral squamous carcinoma cells infected with mumps virus lacked thermotolerance. Mild, namely nonlethal, stress induces HSPs, which act as cell death suppressors. The cells exposed to mild stress become resistant to more severe, potentially lethal stress (29Landry J. Bernier D.

This indicates that transcriptional regulation of HSP27 is different from that of HSP70. Expression of these HSPs is commonly transcriptionally regulated by HSFs, especially HSF-1 (51Gaestel M. Gotthardt R. Müller T. Gene. 1993; 128: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 52Hickey E. Brandon S.E. Potter R. Stein G. Stein J. Weber L.A.

Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). HSF-1 is activated, through phosphorylation, by extracellular stress. Phosphorylated HSF-1 forms trimers, translocates to the nucleus, and binds to conserved regulatory sequences known as heat shock elements (HSEs) on the promoter region of HSP genes (53Morimoto R.I. Science. 1993; 259: 1409-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar, 54Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). In addition, an imperfect estrogen response element has also been identified in the hsp27 promoter (51Gaestel M. Gotthardt R. Müller T. Gene. 1993; 128: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 52Hickey E. Brandon S.E. Potter R. Stein G. Stein J. Weber L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4127-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We found that transcriptional activation of HSP27 was dependent on STAT-1. HSP27 was not induced by stress in mumps virus-infected cells, which have a defect in the STAT-1 protein, and exogenous expression of STAT-1 restored the inducibility of HSP27. STAT-1 is an essential component of a transcriptional activator complex that is induced by both IFN-α and IFN-γ (10Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5014) Google Scholar, 11Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). STAT-1 is activated by phosphorylation on its Tyr-701 and/or Ser-727 residues. Tyr-701 is phosphorylated by Jak1, which is associated with the cytoplasmic domain of IFN receptors, in response to IFN stimulation (10Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5014) Google Scholar, 11Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). Ser is phosphorylated mainly by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (55Goh K.C. Haque S.J. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5601-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 56Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Eyers P.A. Menghini R. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Cohen P. Decker T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13956-13961Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We observed that the Ser residue, but not the Tyr residue, was phosphorylated after heat shock and chemical stress. However, data from the transfection of STAT-1 unphosphorylatable mutants, including dominant-negative and constitutively active mutants, indicated that phosphorylation of STAT-1 is not required for the transcriptional activation of HSP27. How then does STAT-1 work to increase HSP27 expression? One possibility is that STAT-1 is a direct transcriptional activator that is associated with an unknown element of the hsp27 promoter. However, the STAT-1 phosphorylation status of both Tyr and Ser seems to be unrelated to the up-regulation of HSP27. It is possible that another activation mechanism of STAT-1, such as methylation on Arg (57Mowen K.A. Tang J. Zhu W. Schurter B.T. Shuai K. Herschman H.R. David M. Cell. 2001; 104: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), contributes to the stress response. The most probable mechanism is that the activated HSF-1 and STAT-1 complex binds to the HSE(s) of the hsp27 promoter (Fig. 6). In contrast, this complex is likely not to be required for activation of hsp70 promoter. Supporting this idea, STAT-1 associates with HSF-1 in cells, and Tyr- or Ser-unphosphorylated STAT-1 cotranslocates with phosphorylated HSF-1. However, we have tried and failed in observing the interaction of STAT-1 with HSF-1 bound to HSE, for example, by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (data not shown). Alternatively, some negative regulators that are usually kept in check by STAT-1 could be predominantly activated in mumps virus-infected cells in the absence of STAT-1. The relationship between HSF-1 and STAT-1 is very interesting because it indicates cross-talk between the stress response and cytokine signaling. However, only a few studies describing such a relationship have been reported. Stephanou et al. (58Stephanou A. Isenberg D.A. Nakajima K. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1723-1728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 59Stephanou A. Latchman D.S. Latchman D.S. Stress Proteins. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Vol. 136. Springer-Verlag, Berlin-Heidelberg1999: 153-171Google Scholar) reported that the HSEs of HSP70 and HSP90β share a STAT-binding motif, so that STAT-1 synergistically activates the HSF-1-dependent induction of HSP70 and HSP90β and STAT-3 antagonizes it (60Stephanou A. Isenberg D.A. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Latchman D.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 58Stephanou A. Isenberg D.A. Nakajima K. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1723-1728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). They used IFN-γ for STAT-1 activation (58Stephanou A. Isenberg D.A. Nakajima K. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1723-1728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and interleukin-6 for STAT-3 activation (60Stephanou A. Isenberg D.A. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Latchman D.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and clearly showed the contribution of STAT-1 to this system by using 2fTGH cells and STAT-1-deficient U3A mutant cell (58Stephanou A. Isenberg D.A. Nakajima K. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1723-1728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). They also indicated that STAT-1 and HSF-1 directly interact in Hep-G2 cells (58Stephanou A. Isenberg D.A. Nakajima K. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1723-1728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We also have observed an interaction between STAT-1 and HSF-1 in OSC19 cells (Fig. 4). In addition, the hsp70 promoter was less efficiently activated by heat shock in STAT-1-deficient U3A cells compared with 2fTGH cells (Fig. 3). The STAT-1 could have some roles in not only in HSP27 induction but also HSP70 induction. However, we have not observed a synergistic effect of IFN-γ treatment and stress exposure on HSP70 expression, despite our use of several cell types and several techniques such as Western blotting (data not shown) and reporter gene assay (Fig. 3). Conversely, the stress induction of HSP70 tended to be suppressed by treatment with IFN-γ. The reason for this contradiction is not clear. From our results, the interaction between HSF-1 and STAT-1 is important for the stress-related induction of HSP27 but not HSP70. Furthermore, IFN-γ does not affect induction of HSPs by stress exposure. This is supported by the observation that the contribution of STAT-1 to HSP27 expression does not require its phosphorylation on either the Tyr or Ser residues. Host cells produce various immune responses to prevent viral replication and dissemination. Activation of the IFN system is one such major response. Conversely, the virus tries to suppress the host IFN system (8Alcami A. Koszinowski U.H. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 447-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 9Goodbourn S. Didcock L. Randall R.E. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2341-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). The most effective route to global suppression would be to shut off the IFN signal transduction pathway through adjacent IFN receptors, such as the JAK/STAT pathway, rather than to inhibit effector molecules such as 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase and double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase, which are induced by IFN. For example, the measles virus suppresses IFN-α-induced Jak1 phosphorylation but not IFN-γ-induced Tyr phosphorylation (18Yokota S. Saito H. Kubota T. Yokosawa N. Amano K. Fujii N. Virology. 2003; 306: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which seems to have a mild effect on host cells. In contrast, the accelerated degradation of STAT1 proteins by the mumps virus seems to have a very severe effect to host cells, causing almost complete suppression of both IFN-α and IFN-γ signal transduction. Through this strategy, the mumps virus escapes from an IFN-induced antiviral state and apoptosis; in response, the host cell fails to induce thermotolerance, namely resistant to stress (Fig. 6). The lack of thermotolerance could be a by-product of mumps virus infection, or it could be a viral strategy for establishing infection by suppressing the stress response. However, we propose that host cells severely affected by mumps virus should be eliminated easily by apoptosis induced by fever and other stresses in infectious diseases. Therefore, a lack of thermotolerance can be regarded as a host defense mechanism for viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W2044583569,"Mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene are involved in the VHL family cancer syndrome and sporadic renal cell carcinoma. Previous studies indicated that VHL-induced growth arrest required high cell density and growth on extracellular matrix. In the present study, VHL protein (pVHL) levels were observed to be dramatically increased in cells grown to high cell density compared to cells grown at low cell density. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot analysis indicated that VHL mRNA levels were equivalent in sparse and dense cells. The pVHL was rapidly degraded when cell-cell contact was disturbed by trypsinization or EDTA release. Treatment of cells with a proteasome inhibitor blocked the degradation of pVHL. Using a set of VHL deletions fused to GFP, a cell density-dependent region (CDDR) was identified and localized to the c-terminus of pVHL. In addition, other members of the VBC protein complex also showed a cell density-dependent regulation similar to pVHL. Cell density regulation of VHL did not require elongin binding and density-dependent regulation of other VBC components was not dependent on pVHL. In addition, hypoxia inducible factor-2alpha protein levels were elevated in sparse cells with low levels of pVHL and reduced or absent in confluent cells containing abundant VHL. These results indicate that pVHL levels and thus function are tightly regulated by cell-cell signaling. In addition, care must be taken when interpreting studies of VHL function and subcellular localization of cells grown at subconfluent conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2004533883,"Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is a negative regulator of c-Kit and interleukin-3 (IL-3) receptor signaling. We examined the role of SOCS1 in regulating IL-3-induced cell growth of primary bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) from SOCS1 –/– mice. Instead of showing increased proliferation, SOCS1-deficient BMMCs responded poorly to IL-3 and stem cell factor. SOCS1 –/– BMMCs showed increased apoptosis and defective cell cycle entry. We show that the growth retardation of SOCS1 –/– BMMCs was due to a cell intrinsic defect. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation following IL-3 stimulation was markedly diminished in SOCS1 –/– BMMCs. Intriguingly, JAK2 and STAT5 proteins were selectively diminished in SOCS1 –/– BMMCs, which also showed lower molecular mass products of p85 and Vav suggesting proteolytic degradation. Incubation of the SOCS1 –/– BMMC lysate with STAT5, p85, and Vav immunoprecipitated from SOCS1 + / + cells directly demonstrated the dysregulated proteolytic activity in SOCS1 –/– BMMCs. The proteolytic activity in SOCS1 –/– BMMCs was selectively inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and soybean trypsin inhibitor, suggesting that the protease regulated by SOCS1 is a tryptase. The dysregulated tryptase in SOCS1 –/– BMMCs is unlikely to be mMCP6 or mMCP7, because the enzyme activity was not inhibited by Polybrene but was inhibited by normal mouse plasma. SOCS1 + / + BMMC lysate inhibited the proteolytic activity present in SOCS1 –/– BMMC lysate, indicating that SOCS1 –/– BMMCs lack an endogenous protease inhibitor. These results show that SOCS1 is required for the expression and/or stability of an endogenous protease inhibitor, which protects mast cells from their own proteolytic enzymes. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is a negative regulator of c-Kit and interleukin-3 (IL-3) receptor signaling. We examined the role of SOCS1 in regulating IL-3-induced cell growth of primary bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) from SOCS1 –/– mice. Instead of showing increased proliferation, SOCS1-deficient BMMCs responded poorly to IL-3 and stem cell factor. SOCS1 –/– BMMCs showed increased apoptosis and defective cell cycle entry. We show that the growth retardation of SOCS1 –/– BMMCs was due to a cell intrinsic defect. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation following IL-3 stimulation was markedly diminished in SOCS1 –/– BMMCs. Intriguingly, JAK2 and STAT5 proteins were selectively diminished in SOCS1 –/– BMMCs, which also showed lower molecular mass products of p85 and Vav suggesting proteolytic degradation. Incubation of the SOCS1 –/– BMMC lysate with STAT5, p85, and Vav immunoprecipitated from SOCS1 + / + cells directly demonstrated the dysregulated proteolytic activity in SOCS1 –/– BMMCs. The proteolytic activity in SOCS1 –/– BMMCs was selectively inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and soybean trypsin inhibitor, suggesting that the protease regulated by SOCS1 is a tryptase. The dysregulated tryptase in SOCS1 –/– BMMCs is unlikely to be mMCP6 or mMCP7, because the enzyme activity was not inhibited by Polybrene but was inhibited by normal mouse plasma. SOCS1 + / + BMMC lysate inhibited the proteolytic activity present in SOCS1 –/– BMMC lysate, indicating that SOCS1 –/– BMMCs lack an endogenous protease inhibitor. These results show that SOCS1 is required for the expression and/or stability of an endogenous protease inhibitor, which protects mast cells from their own proteolytic enzymes. The generation, survival, proliferation, and functions of most hematopoietic cells critically depend on cytokines (1Watowich S.S. Wu H. Socolovsky M. Klingmuller U. Constantinescu S.N. Lodish H.F.

A majority of the growth-promoting cytokines transduce signals by activating intracellular Janus family of protein-tyrosine kinases (JAKs) 1The abbreviations used are: JAK, Janus tyrosine kinase; BMMCs, bone marrow-derived mast cells; SCF, stem cell factor; SOCS1, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; IL, interleukin; FBS, fetal bovine serum; CS, culture supernatant; CFSE, 5-(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester; IFN, interferon; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; STI, soybean tryptase inhibitor; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; TLCK, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcriptase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; TNP, trinitrophenyl. non-covalently associated with the cytokine receptor subunits (see Refs. 3Leonard W.J.

Cell. 2002; 109: S121-S131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar for reviews). The catalytic activity of JAK kinases is low in the absence of cytokine stimulation. Upon ligand binding, receptor oligomerization allows trans-autophosphorylation of the JAKs in their activation loop tyrosine, which stimulates their kinase activity. This leads to phosphorylation of the receptor chains and recruitment of adaptor proteins and second messengers to the receptor complex. The primary mediators of cytokine receptor signaling downstream of JAKs are signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) (5Ihle J.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), which become tyrosine-phosphorylated, dimerize, translocate into the nucleus, and induce transcription of specific sets of genes to mediate the cellular responses of cytokine stimulation. The cytokine stimulated JAK-STAT pathway is highly regulated so that the activating signals of appropriate magnitude are delivered for only the required duration (reviewed in Refs. 6Starr R. Hilton D.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar and 7Yasukawa H. Sasaki A. Yoshimura A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 143-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). These signals are promptly attenuated to prevent excessive signaling and uncontrolled cellular stimulation. This is achieved by several mechanisms regulating the JAK kinase activity and the functioning of the STAT molecules. Proteintyrosine phosphatases recruited to the cytokine receptor complex dephosphorylate the JAK kinases at their activation loop tyrosine thereby attenuating their enzymatic activity. Protein inhibitor of activated STAT family proteins bind to activated STAT molecules preventing their DNA-binding activity (8Shuai K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2638-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). However, the major regulatory pathway attenuating cytokine receptor signal transduction is mediated by the SOCS family of negative feedback regulators (9Alexander W.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 1-7Crossref Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The SOCS family contains at least eight known members. Genes encoding CIS1, SOCS1, SOCS2, and SOCS3 are rapidly induced following cytokine stimulation, and many cytokines induce the expression of several SOCS family members. All SOCS proteins have a conserved C-terminal motif called the SOCS box, which is also present in many other proteins of diverse functions (10Kile B.T. Schulman B.A. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Martin H.M. Hilton D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 235-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). A central SH2 domain is also a feature of the SOCS family members, whereas the N-terminal end is quite variable in sequence and length. The regulatory function of SOCS molecules is mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain to the activation loop tyrosine of the JAK kinases (11Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). A stretch of amino acids N-terminal to the SH2 domain of SOCS1 is required for its inhibitory function. After the binding of the SH2 domain to phosphotyrosine, the pre-SH2 region is believed to occlude the substrate binding pocket of the kinase. In this manner, SOCS1 functions as a competitive inhibitor of JAK kinase substrates. This physical interaction subsequently leads to the destruction of the JAK kinase via ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation (17Frantsve J. Schwaller J. Sternberg D.W. Kutok J. Gilliland D.G. Mol.

Dubreuil P. de Sepulveda P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4351-4362Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This latter function of SOCS1 requires the SOCS box, which interacts with components of an E3-ubiquitin protein ligase that ubiquitinates the JAKs and targets them for proteasomal degradation (10Kile B.T.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12230-12232Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Several other proteins also interact with SOCS1 via its SH2 domain and the N-terminal proline-rich sequences, and some of these proteins are also ubiquitinated and targeted for proteasomal degradation (16De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. Rose J.L. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 22De Sepulveda P. Ilangumaran S. Rottapel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14005-14008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We have shown that SOCS1 is rapidly induced in mast cells following stimulation with stem cell factor (SCF) and IL-3 (16De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. Rose J.L. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Mast cells play diverse roles in inflammation and anti-parasitic immunity and are the central effector cells in allergic reactions (23Stevens R.L. Austen K.F. Immunol. Today. 1989; 10: 381-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Gurish M.F. Austen K.F. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: F1-F5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They differentiate from hematopoietic stem cells into committed progenitor cells, which circulate in the blood before migrating to mucosal and connective tissues of peripheral organs where they mature into phenotypically distinct mucosal or connective tissue mast cells (25Galli S.J. Hammel I. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1994; 1: 33-39PubMed Google Scholar). Development of mast cells and their survival in the peripheral tissues are critically dependent on SCF. In addition to SCF, IL-3 also stimulates mast cell differentiation and proliferation. Mast cells are unique among hematopoietic cells in that they can be cultured from bone marrow progenitors using either SCF or IL-3 alone (26Metcalfe D.D. Baram D. Mekori Y.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1033-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) from SOCS1 –/– mice to address whether SOCS1 is a critical regulator of IL-3 signaling. To our surprise, we observed that SOCS1-deficient BMMCs showed a poor proliferative response to IL-3 and SCF, because SOCS1 deficiency dysregulated mast cell proteolytic enzymes leading to selective degradation of several signaling molecules. Mast Cell Cultures from SOCS1 – / – Mice—SOCS1 +/– mice were generous gifts from Dr. J. Ihle. The SOCS1 –/– were bred in our animal care facility from SOCS1 heterozygous parents, because SOCS1 –/– mice die within 2–3 weeks after birth. Mast cell cultures were established from the bone marrow of femurs obtained from SOCS1 –/– mice as soon as they were phenotypically detectable, usually around 8–14 days. All animal work was performed following institutional guidelines. BMMCs were cultured in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and IL-3. Culture supernatants (CS) from the X630/mIL-3 cell line (27Karasuyama H. Melchers F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) and BHK/mKL (a gift from S. Tsai) were used at 1:100 dilution as sources of IL-3 and SCF, respectively. Non-adherent cells were subcultured every 3–4 days at 0.5 × 106/ml concentration. After 4 weeks, the cultures were highly enriched for mast cells, representing more than 95% of all cells based on toluidine blue staining (data not shown). The cultures were maintained in culture for up to 6 months, and the cells were used for experiments from 4 weeks onward. Antibodies and Reagents—Antibodies against mouse IgE, CD16/CD32 (FcγRIII/II) CD45 (Ly5.2), CD117 (c-Kit), and IL-3Rα conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate, phycoerythrin, or biotin were purchased from BD Pharmingen (Palo Alto, CA). Streptavidin-spectral red was from Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc. (Birmingham, AL). Mouse monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine (4G10) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p85, JAK2, and phospho-JAK2 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against phospho-STAT5 (pSTAT5) was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against STAT5, Vav, and p85 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to Bax and p27Kip were from BD Transduction Laboratories. 5-(6)-Carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Mouse monoclonal IgE against TNP (clone C38 –2) and anti-actin antibody (clone AC-15) were from Sigma. Anti-HSP70 monoclonal antibody was a kind gift from R. Miller (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto). Complete® protease inhibitor mixture, AEBSF, leupeptin, and aprotinin were from Roche Applied Science. Protease inhibitors PMSF, soybean tryptase inhibitor (STI), benzamidine, TPCK, TLCK, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, (2S,3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester (E-64), EDTA, and STI-conjugated agarose beads were from Sigma. Proteasome inhibitors MG132, proteasome inhibitor I (ZAL), and lactacystin were from Calbiochem. N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (calpain inhibitor I), N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Met-al (calpain inhibitor II), and Ala-Ala-Phe chloromethyl ketone were from Sigma. Epoxomycin was from Affinity (Exeter, UK). Neutralizing anti-IFNγ antibody was from BD Pharmingen. Mouse fibrinogen was purchased from Sigma. Flow Cytometry—Single cell suspensions in PBS containing 5% FBS and 0.05% sodium azide were incubated with indicated fluorochrome- or biotin-conjugated antibodies for 15 min. After washing twice in PBS/FBS, biotin-conjugated primary antibodies were followed by streptavidin-spectral red. Washed cells were analyzed in a FACSCalibur® using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, Mountainview, CA). To detect FcϵRI, mast cells were incubated first with IgE monoclonal antibody against TNP followed by anti-mouse IgE. For detecting cells undergoing apoptotic death, cells in steady-state growth were washed and resuspended in Annexin-V binding buffer followed by Annexin-V staining and flow cytometric analysis. Cell Proliferation Assays and Cell Cycle Analysis—1 × 105 BMMCs were stimulated with indicated concentrations of IL-3 or SCF for 48 h in 96-well U bottom plates. 1 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) was added per well during the last 8 h. Neutralizing antibodies were added at the initiation of the culture. The cells were harvested onto glass fiber filter mats, and the incorporated radioactivity was measured in a TopCount® liquid scintillation counter (Canberra/Packard, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The CFSE dye dilution assay for cell proliferation was used to address whether SOCS1-deficient BMMCs can cross-inhibit wild type BMMCs. Wild type BMMCs were labeled with CFSE by incubating them at 2 × 107 cells/ml in PBS containing 5 μm CFSE for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with an equal volume of FBS. The cells were washed twice and stimulated with IL-3 (at 1:100 dilution of the CS), in the presence of unlabeled SOCS1-deficient or wild type cells. At indicated time points, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry to evaluate the dilution of CFSE fluorescence intensity, which is indicative of cell division. Cell cycle analysis was done on BMMCs in steady-state growth or on cells starved overnight in Opti-MEM containing 0.5% FBS and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Following stimulation with IL-3 for indicated periods of time, 1 × 106 cells were pelleted and chilled on ice. The cells were resuspended directly in low salt Vindelov's solution containing propidium iodide (100 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 700 units/ml RNase, 7.5 μm propidium iodide) with continuous mixing. The cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the proportions of cells in G1, S, M, and G2 phases were estimated using ModFit™ (Verity Software House). RT-PCR—For RT-PCR analysis of cytokine gene expression in mast cells, total RNA was isolated from 1 × 106 BMMCs in steady-state growth using 1 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Equivalent amount of RNA was primed with oligo(dT), and first strand cDNA was synthesized using Thermoscript™ reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed on equivalent amounts of cDNA using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermocycler (PE Applied Biosystems). The sense and antisense primers used for PCR detection of specific mRNA are as follows: IFNγ, AACGCTACACACTGCATCT and TGCTCATTGTAATGCTTGG; TNFα, GAAAGCATGATCCGCGACGTGGA and TACGACGTGGGCTACAGGCTTG; TGFβ, CGGGGCGACCTGGGCACCATCCATGAC and CTGCTCCACCTTGGGCTTGCGACCCAC; lymphotoxin, TCAGAAGCACTTGACCCAT and AAGTCCCGGATACACAGACT; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, TGATGGGTGTGAACCACGAG and TCAGTGTAGCCCAAGATGCC; mMCP-2 (mouse mast cell protease-2), ATTTCATTGCCTAGTTCCTCTGAC and CAGGATGAGAACAGGCTGGGAT; mMCP-4, GTAATTCCTCTGCCTCGTCCTTC and TGACAGGATGGACACATGCTTT; mMCP-5, GGCAGAACAAACGTGAATGAGCC and AAGAACCTTCTGGAAGCTCAGGG; mMCP-6, GCACATCAAAAGCCACAGC and TAGACAGGGGAGACAGAGGAC; mMCP-7, GCACTACTCCTCACTGTG and CGCATTTTATTGAGGCATAGCAGA; mouse β-actin, GGCATTGTTACCAACTGGGAC and ACCAGAGGCATACAGGGACAG. Western Blot—Cytokine-stimulated and unstimulated control BMMCs were pelleted and lysed either directly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1% w/v SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) by boiling, or in TNN lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% v/v Nonidet P-40) by incubating on ice for 30 min. Lysates containing equivalent amounts of total proteins, quantitated by BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL), were electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to PVDF membranes, and probed with phospho-STAT5 antibody following the manufacturer's instructions. The blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). The blots were stripped by incubating in stripping solution (2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 55 °C, blocked and reprobed for STAT5. A similar protocol was followed for other phosphospecific antibodies. Fibrinolysis Assay—BMMCs were lysed in TNN lysis buffer containing the Complete® protease inhibitor mixture at 10 × 106 cells per ml. Mouse fibrinogen was dissolved in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA at 1 mg/ml concentration. 15 μg of fibrinogen was incubated with BMMC lysates containing 20 μg of total proteins at 37 °C for 1 h in a total volume of 30 μl. To inhibit the fibrinolytic activity of the proteolytic enzymes, PMSF or normal mouse plasma was added to a final concentration of 1 mm and 1%, respectively, to the BMMC lysate and incubated for 10 min at room temperature before adding to fibrinogen. At the end of the reaction, the protein content of the reaction mixture was denatured by boiling in sample buffer. The proteins were separated in SDS-PAGE gels and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. SOCS1-deficient Mast Cells Exhibit Retarded Growth Due to Decreased Proliferative Response to IL-3 and Stem Cell Factor—We have previously shown that SOCS1 is rapidly induced in primary BMMCs following stimulation with IL-3 or SCF, and forced expression of SOCS1 inhibits SCF-mediated cell proliferation without interfering with cell survival signals delivered via the c-Kit receptor (16De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. Rose J.L. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In addition to SCF, IL-3 also stimulates mast cell differentiation and proliferation. To address whether SOCS1 is a critical regulator of IL-3 signaling, we established BMMCs from SOCS1 –/– mice using IL-3. Flow cytometric analysis of the mast cells for surface markers showed comparable levels of CD45 and FcγRIII/II (CD16/32) on SOCS1-deficient and control cells (Fig. 1A). Even though the expression of FcϵRI was slightly lower in SOCS1 –/– cells (Fig. 1A), these cells did not significantly differ from SOCS1-sufficient cells in IgE-mediated degranulation (data not shown). Surprisingly, SOCS1-deficient BMMCs exhibited a very slow growth rate compared with that of wild type BMMCs in response to IL-3 or SCF (Fig. 1B and data not shown), despite expressing comparable levels of the receptors for IL-3 and c-Kit (Fig. 1A). The decreased proliferative response of SOCS1-deficient BMMCs remained unchanged over a wide concentration range of IL-3 or SCF (Fig. 1C). These results show that SOCS1 is essential for normal growth response of mast cells to cytokines. SOCS1-deficient Mast Cells Show Defective Cell Cycle Entry and Increased Apoptosis—To examine whether the decreased proliferative response of SOCS1-deficient BMMCs to IL-3 was due to increased cell death, we stained the SOCS1 –/– BMMCs with Annexin V. IL-3-stimulated SOCS1-deficient mast cell cultures contained at least three times more apoptotic cells than the wild type cultures (Fig. 2A). To investigate whether the increased cell death in SOCS1-deficient mast cell cultures arises from a cell cycle defect, we carried out a cell cycle analysis of these cells at different time points after IL-3 stimulation and in steady-state growth. At all time points after IL-3 stimulation, the proportion of cells in the S phase was 5- to 10-fold less in SOCS1 –/– cultures compared with wild type cultures (Fig. 2B). In steady-state cultures, SOCS1-deficient BMMCs did not accumulate at the G2/M phase (Fig. 2B). These results suggested that the decreased proliferative response of SOCS1-deficient BMMCs and their increased apoptosis could result either from active growth suppression or from an intrinsic inability of these cells to pass through the cell cycle restriction point. Decreased Proliferation of SOCS1-deficient Mast Cells Results from a Cell Autonomous Defect—SOCS1 –/– mice die from unbridled IFNγ signaling (28Alexander W.S. Starr R. Fenner J.E. Scott C.L.

Cell. 1999; 98: 609-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), and SOCS1-deficient fibroblasts are hypersensitive to growth inhibition by IFNγ (30Ilangumaran S. Finan D. La Rose J. Raine J. Silverstein A. De Sepulveda P. Rottapel R. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5010-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because IFNγ is cytostatic for several cell types, and IL-3-dependent mast cell lines are reported to express IFNγ mRNA and other growth inhibitory cytokines such as TGFβ (see Ref. 31Gordon J.R. Burd P.R. Galli S.J. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 458-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar for review), we examined the cytokine profile of SOCS1-deficient BMMCs by RT-PCR. Whereas the mitogen-stimulated lymph node cells showed the induction of the IFNγ gene, we could not detect IFNγ message in wild type BMMCs or in SOCS1-deficient BMMCs (Fig. 3A). Moreover, neutralizing IFNγ antibody, which blocked IFNγ-induced STAT1 phosphorylation in fibroblasts (data not shown), failed to restore the proliferation of SOCS1-deficient BMMCs to IL-3 or SCF (Fig. 3B). Moreover, addition of exogenous IFNγ did not decrease the growth response of wild mast cells to IL-3 or SCF (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that endogenous IFNγ is unlikely to be responsible for the retarded growth of SOCS1-deficient BMMCs. Expression of TNFα, lymphotoxin (TNFβ), and TGFβ mRNA showed no appreciable difference between SOCS1-deficient and SOCS1-sufficient BMMCs (Fig. 3A), however, we do not rule out the possibility that SOCS1-deficient BMMCs may be more susceptible to the growth inhibitory effects of these cytokines. To investigate whether SOCS1-deficient BMMCs may be secreting an unknown growth inhibitory factor, we cultured wild type BMMCs in conditioned media from SOCS1-deficient BMMCs. Proliferation of wild type BMMCs was unaffected by conditioned media from SOCS1-deficient BMMCs generated with or without IL-3 stimulation (Fig. 3C). To further explore whether SOCS1-deficient BMMCs may be expressing on their surface a hitherto unidentified growth inhibitory molecule, we labeled wild type BMMCs with CFSE, a green fluorescent dye that labels cellular proteins and gets equally partitioned into daughter cells upon cell division. Co-culture with unlabeled SOCS1-deficient BMMCs did not alter the cell division profile of the CFSE-labeled wild type BMMCs (Fig. 3D). These results showed that SOCS1-deficient BMMCs are not expressing any growth inhibitory molecule that may act on the adjacent cells and strongly suggested that the retarded growth of SOCS1-deficient BMMCs is due to a cell intrinsic defect. Cytokine-stimulated Protein-tyrosine Phosphorylation Is Defective in SOCS1-deficient Mast Cells—IL-3 signals through a receptor complex composed of the IL-3Rα chain and the βc chain. Upon IL-3 binding, the βc-associated JAK2 is activated and phosphorylates the receptor chains and several signaling proteins, including STAT5 (32Reddy E.P. Korapati A. Chaturvedi P. Rane S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2532-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To examine whether these membrane proximal signaling pathways are intact in SOCS1-deficient BMMCs, we first evaluated the profile of Tyr-phosphorylated proteins in mast cells stimulated with IL-3. An equivalent number of cells were lysed directly in denaturing lysis buffer and blotted with 4G10 anti-P-Tyr antibody. Strikingly, SOCS1-deficient BMMCs showed a less pronounced protein-tyrosine phosphorylation following cytokine stimulation compared with wild type cells (Fig. 4, left panels). Stimulation with SCF also elicited weaker tyrosine phosphorylation in SOCS1-deficient BMMCs than in wild type cells (data not shown). Probing the blots with phospho-specific antibodies showed negligible quantities of phospho-JAK2 and phosphoSTAT5 in SOCS1-deficient BMMCs (Fig. 4, right panels). Strikingly, reprobing the blots revealed that the total amounts of JAK2 and STAT5 were markedly lower in SOCS1-deficient BMMCs, whereas the levels of other control proteins such as Bax, p27 kip , or actin were comparable between SOCS1-deficient and SOCS1-sufficient BMMCs (Fig. 4, right panels). Because the cells were lysed by boiling in SDS containing lysis buffer immediately after stimulation, these results suggested that SOCS1 deficiency impaired cytokine receptor signaling as a result of decreased steady-state levels of critical signal transduction molecules. SOCS1 Deficiency Causes a Selective Loss of Several Signaling Proteins in Mast Cells—To further investigate the selective loss of certain signaling proteins in SOCS1-deficient BMMCs, we examined other signaling molecules known to be phosphorylated by IL-3R signaling.
