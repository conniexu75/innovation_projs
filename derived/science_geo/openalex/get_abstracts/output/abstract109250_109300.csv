https://openalex.org/W1598676150,"We have constructed stable cell lines expressing transporters for dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT) by transfection with cloned cDNAs. The parental LLC-PK1 cell does not express any of these neurotransmitter transporters. Therefore, monoamine transport activities in each of these cell lines are due to the transfected DNA only, allowing comparison in the same background. Drug inhibition profiles for each cell line are distinct and as expected for each transporter. LLC-NET and LLC-DAT cells transported both NE and DA and both cell types exhibited a lower KM for DA transport than for NE transport. Analysis of Vmax data for LLC-NET cells suggests that substrate is bound to the NE transporter during the rate-limiting step(s) in transport. The cocaine analog 2-beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-[125I]iodophenyl)tropane binds to each cell type, and is displaced by transport substrate in each case. Binding and transport measurements on parallel cell cultures allowed estimation of turnover numbers for norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin transporters. All three transporters require external Na+ and Cl-. The Na+ concentration dependence suggests that a single Na+ ion is involved in transport catalyzed by norepinephrine and serotonin transporters while more than one Na+ ion participate in transport mediated by the dopamine transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1576763630,"Bone is a target tissue of androgens, but the mechanisms by which they act on bone are still unclear. This study examines the early (5-60 s) effects of 1 pM to 1 microM testosterone on cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and diacyglycerol (DAG) formation in confluent male rat osteoblasts. 10 pM to 10 nM testosterone increased [Ca2+]i within 5 s via Ca2+ influx as shown by the effects of EGTA and the Ca2+ channel blockers nifedipine and verapamil and via Ca2+ mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum as shown by the effects of thapsigargin and neomycin. 10 pM to 10 nM testosterone increased InsP3 and DAG formation within 10 s. Testosterone immobilized on bovine serum albumin (testosterone (O-carboxymethyl)oxime/bovine serum albumin) and its derivative, (O-carboxymethyl)oxime, rapidly increased [Ca2+]i and InsP3 and DAG formation and were full agonists, although they were less potent than the free steroid. Cyproterone acetate, a nuclear antagonist, did not block the increase in [Ca2+]i and InsP3 and DAG formation induced by testosterone. Finally, neomycin and pertussis toxin totally abolished the effects of testosterone on InsP3 and DAG. These results suggest that male rat osteoblasts bear nongenomic unconventional cell-surface receptors for testosterone that belong to the class of the membrane receptors coupled to a phospholipase C via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein."
https://openalex.org/W1552189630,"Classical studies using bovine chromaffin granules have defined the physiologic and pharmacologic properties of the vesicular amine transporter that packages monoamine transmitters into intracellular vesicles for subsequent regulated release. The recent isolation of two distinct but closely related cDNA clones encoding vesicular amine transport suggests that the activity expressed in the brain (synaptic vesicle amine transporter or SVAT) may differ significantly from the previously described adrenal gland activity (chromaffin granule amine transporter or CGAT). A direct comparison of the two transporters now shows that SVAT has a higher affinity than CGAT for monoamine substrates, in particular for histamine. In addition, SVAT shows approximately 10-fold greater sensitivity to tetrabenazine than CGAT. [3H]Dihydrotetrabenazine shows no detectable binding to CGAT but does bind to SVAT, accounting for the differential sensitivity. Furthermore, methamphetamine preferentially inhibits transport by SVAT relative to CGAT, apparently by competing at the site of amine recognition rather than by disrupting the vesicular pH gradient. These previously unsuspected differences in the storage of monoamine transmitter in the central nervous system and the adrenal gland may help to account for several classic pharmacological observations."
https://openalex.org/W1531796828,"The regulatory volume decrease (RVD) of a renal cortical collecting duct cell line (RCCT-28A) exposed to a hypotonic solution was studied using electronic cell sizing to measure cell volume and the patch clamp technique to measure Cl- channel activity. Results demonstrate that RVD was mediated in part by KCl loss through separate K+ and Cl- channels. The Cl- channel had a conductance of 305 pS and was activated by cell swelling, membrane stretch, and disruption of F-actin by dihydrocytochalasins. In contrast, stabilizing F-actin with phalloidin prevented swelling and stretch activation of the Cl- channel and inhibited the RVD. Thus, the state of actin polymerization regulates the probability of the 305 pS Cl- channel being open. Short actin filaments activate whereas long actin filaments inactivate the channel. Taken together, our studies suggest that RVD in this renal collecting duct cell line cell is mediated in part by a 305 pS Cl- channel, which is activated, during cell swelling, by a signaling pathway that includes disruption of F-actin."
https://openalex.org/W1486244460,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is metabolized by a Gram-negative aerobic bacterium via a novel pathway involving oxidative skeletal rearrangement of the BPA. Oxidation of the aliphatic methyl group of BPA leads to coproduction of the methyl-hyroxylated 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propanol and a skeletally rearranged triol 1,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propanol. The major route of metabolism (> 80%) is through the rearrangement. The 1,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propanol is dehydrated to 4,4'-dihydroxy-alpha-methylstilbene, which is rapidly cleaved by oxidation to 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 4-hydroxyacetophenone. 4-Hydroxybenzaldehyde is oxidized to 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. Both 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-hydroxyacetophenone are mineralized. The minor product of BPA hydroxylation, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propanol, is further oxidized to form both 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid and a skeletally rearranged tetraol, 2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,2-propanediol. As is the case in the hydroxylation of BPA, the major product is skeletally rearranged. 2,3-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,2-propanediol is slowly transformed to 4-hydroxyphenacyl alcohol."
https://openalex.org/W1506594192,"The complete amino acid sequence of the selenoprotein phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPX) from pig heart has been deduced from the corresponding genomic DNA, the cDNA covering the coding region, and by sequencing the N terminus of the protein. The maximum length of the peptide chain derived from the cDNA amounts to 170 amino acid residues. By protein sequencing the N-terminal residues methionine and cysteine of the deduced sequence were found to be cleaved. The molecular mass of 19,671 Da obtained by laser desorption mass spectroscopy, however, significantly exceeds the mean molecular mass of 19,257.09 calculated for the sequence 3-170 of PHGPX, thus indicating posttranscriptional modification. In contrast to glutathione peroxidase (GPX) the coding area of the PHGPX gene is composed of seven exons. Only the amino acid sequences encoded by the third and fifth exon are highly homologous to GPX sequences. The amino acid residues selenocysteine, tryptophan, and glutamine forming the catalytic site in bovine GPX are conserved in homologous positions of PHGPX, whereas the arginine residues presumed to bind GSH in GPX are not. Gaps in the PHGPX sequence correspond to subunit interaction sites of the tetrameric GPX. The data suggest an identical catalytic mechanism of the selenoperoxidases, a less stringent substrate specificity of PHGPX, and explain the monomeric nature of PHGPX. As in other selenoproteins, the selenocysteine residue of PHGPX is encoded by UGA. The 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the PHGPX shows a limited consensus with that of GPX and 5'-deiodinase, where it was shown to be responsible for the decoding of UGA as selenocysteine. The 3'-UTR of PHGPX can form a stem/loop as in other mammalian selenoprotein genes. The 5'-UTR and the first intron of the PHGPX gene contain a variety of putative regulatory elements indicating hormonal control."
https://openalex.org/W177621860,"The role of vacuolar Ca2+ transport systems in regulating cellular Ca2+ was investigated by measuring the vacuolar Ca2+ transport rate, the free energy available to drive vacuolar Ca2+ transport, the ability of the vacuole to buffer lumenal Ca2+, and the vacuolar Ca2+ efflux rate. The magnitude of the Ca2+ gradient generated by the vacuolar H+ gradient best supports a 1 Ca2+:2 H+ coupling ratio for the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger. This coupling ratio along with a cytosolic Ca2+ concentration of 125 nM would give a vacuolar free Ca2+ concentration of approximately 30 microM. The total vacuolar Ca2+ concentration is approximately 2 mM due to Ca2+ binding to vacuolar polyphosphate. The Ca2+ efflux rate from the vacuole is less than the growth rate indicating that the steady-state Ca2+ loading level of the vacuole is dependent mainly on the Ca2+ transport rate and the rate that vacuolar Ca2+ is diluted by growth. Based on the kinetic parameters of vacuolar Ca2+ accumulation in vitro, the maximum rate of Ca2+ accumulation in vivo is expected to be approximately 0.2 nmol of Ca2+ min-1 mg protein-1, a rate that is similar to the cellular Ca2+ accumulation rate. The cytosolic Ca2+ concentration increases from 0.1 microM to 1-2 microM as the extracellular Ca2+ concentration is raised from 0.3 mM to 50 mM. The rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration increases cellular Ca2+ from 10 to 300 nmol Ca2+/mg by increasing the rate of vacuolar Ca2+ accumulation but does not significantly alter the cellular growth rate."
https://openalex.org/W1540308607,"Class A amphipathic helixes present in exchangeable plasma apolipoproteins are characterized by the location of positively charged amino acid residues at the non-polar-polar interface and negatively charged amino acid residues at the center of the polar face. The objectives of the present study were: (i) to investigate the role of hydrocarbon side chain length of the interfacial positively charged amino acid residues in the lipid affinity of class A amphipathic helixes, and (ii) to investigate the importance of the nature of interfacial charge in the lipid affinity of class A amphipathic helixes. Toward this end, lipid interactions of the following two analogs of the class A amphipathic helix, Ac-18A-NH2 (acetyl-Asp-Trp-Leu-Lys-Ala-Phe-Tyr- Asp-Lys-Val-Ala-Glu-Lys-Leu-Lys-Glu-Ala-Phe-NH2), and Ac-18A(Lys > Haa)-NH2 (acetyl-Asp-Trp-Leu-Haa-Ala-Phe-Tyr-Asp-Haa-Val-Ala-Glu-Haa-Leu-Haa-Glu- Ala-Phe-NH2) (Haa = homoaminoalanine), were studied. The side chain of Haa has two CH2 groups less than that of lysine. The lipid affinities of these two peptide analogs were compared with that of Ac-18R-NH2, an analog of Ac-18A-NH2 with positions of the charged amino acid residues reversed. The techniques used in these studies were circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, right-angle light scattering measurements, and differential scanning calorimetry. The results of these studies indicated the following rank order of lipid affinity: Ac-18A-NH2 > Ac-18A(Lys > Haa)-NH2 > Ac-18R-NH2. These results are in agreement with the snorkel model proposed earlier to explain the higher lipid affinity of class A amphipathic helixes (Segrest, J. P., Loof, H. D., Dohlman, J. G., Brouillette, C. G., and Anantharamaiah, G. M. (1990) Proteins Struct. Funct. Genetics 8, 103-117). In addition, it was observed from the differential scanning calorimetry studies that Ac-18A-NH2 and Ac-18A(Lys > Haa)-NH2 interact more strongly than Ac-18R-NH2 with negatively charged dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol. The weaker interaction of Ac-18R-NH2 with dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol is suggested to be due to electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged lipid and the interfacial negative charges of the peptide."
https://openalex.org/W72493355,"The interaction between human factor IXa and factor VIII or its constituent units was investigated. Equilibrium binding studies were performed employing factor VIII light chain that was immobilized on a monoclonal antibody. Factor VIII light chain was observed to bind factor IXa with high affinity (Kd = 14.8 +/- 3.2 nM) and approximately 1:1 stoichiometry. Optimal interaction required NaCl concentrations below 0.2 M and the presence of Ca2+ ions. Factor VIII light chain in solution effectively inhibited binding of factor IXa to the immobilized light chain (Ki = 10.9 +/- 1.9 nM). The isolated factor VIII light chain and the factor VIII heterodimer were equally effective in factor IXa binding, demonstrating that this interaction did not require the factor VIII heavy chain. Factor Xa and activated Protein C were found to be inefficient (Ki > or = 1.2 microM) in competing with factor IXa, indicating that the high affinity for factor VIII light chain was unique for factor IXa. The factor IXa-factor VIII light chain interaction was inhibited by von Willebrand factor, but this effect was abolished by cleavage of the factor VIII light chain by thrombin. An antibody that inhibits von Willebrand factor-factor VIII complex formation did not compete for factor IXa binding. In contrast, association of factor IXa with the factor VIII light chain was inhibited by an antibody directed against the factor VIII region Gln1778-Asp1840. We propose that this sequence provides a factor IXa binding site and that its exposure requires dissociation of the factor VIII-von Willebrand factor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1528752221,"Although a pathway that requires sequential activation of Ras, Raf, and MAP kinase kinase has been proposed as the major mechanism for stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase), alternative pathways also exist. A wide variety of extracellular stimuli have been shown to activate MAP kinase; however, the precise mechanisms by which these stimuli mediate the signaling events have not been elucidated. Using a Balb/c-derived cell line expressing a dominant-negative mutant of Raf, we determined whether Raf is required for the activation of MAP kinase by growth factors, phorbol esters, and calcium. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate activated Ras in both mutant and control cells. However, stimulation of MAP kinase by IGF-I was nearly abolished in the dominant-negative Raf mutant. Stimulation of MAP kinase by the Ca2+ mobilizer thapsigargin was also inhibited in the presence of the Raf mutant. In contrast, EGF and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate remained potent stimulators of MAP kinase in the dominant-negative Raf cells. The activation of MAP kinase by these stimuli can be further distinguished by differential requirements for Ca2+ and protein kinase C. These results suggest that Raf is required for the activation of MAP kinase by IGF-I and calcium, whereas EGF and possibly phorbol esters may employ alternative Raf-independent pathways for MAP kinase activation."
https://openalex.org/W1563052800,"The flavohemoprotein (FHP) encoding gene of the strictly respiratory Gram-negative bacterium Alcaligenes eutrophus was isolated from a megaplasmid library by using FHP-specific antibodies and oligonucleotide probes based on the amino-terminal polypeptide sequence of FHP, determined previously (Zhu, H., and Riggs, A. F. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 5015-5019). The fhp gene codes for a monomeric polypeptide of 403 amino acids (M(r) 44,796) whose structure is highly homologous to the proteins of the two-domain flavohemoglobin family, comprising the hemoproteins from Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. FHP consists of an amino-terminal-located O2-binding hemoglobin domain and a carboxyl-terminal-located redoxactive domain with potential binding sites for NAD(P)H and FAD. Two potential binding motifs for NARL and FNR upstream of fhp suggest a role of FHP in the anaerobic metabolism of A. eutrophus. Isogenic Fhp-negative mutants showed no significant delay in aerobic or anaerobic growth. Compared with the wild type, however, the mutant did not accumulate nitrous oxide during denitrification with nitrite as electron acceptor. This property was restored by complementation. The result suggests that FHP interacts directly or indirectly with the gas metabolism during denitrification in A. eutrophus."
https://openalex.org/W2107902741,"Nineteen mutants that lost the ability to grow in 100 mM Ca2+ (but remained insensitive to 50 mM Sr2+) were identified in a screen of approximately 60,000 mutagenized yeast colonies. Cells carrying mutations in the CSG2 gene grow normally in low Ca2+ medium but have decreased growth rates when the Ca2+ concentration is above 10 mM. The csg2 mutant cells accumulate much higher levels of Ca2+ in a compartment that is exchangeable with extracellular Ca2+ but the nonexchangeable Ca2+ pool which predominates in wild-type cells is not influenced. Sr2+ influx is not increased in the csg2 mutant cells. Mg2+ decreases the amount of Ca2+ in the non-exchangeable pool without influencing the csg2-induced exchangeable Ca2+ pool. The data indicate that the csg2 mutation causes a selective increase in Ca2+ accumulation into a pool which is distinct from the vacuolar pool. The CSG2 protein consists of 410 amino acids, contains nine putative transmembrane segments, four potential sites for N-linked glycosylation, and a sequence with homology to the EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1587665145,"In this study, we have examined the relationship between epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC-gamma 1) and its translocation from the cytosol to the Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeleton fraction in rat hepatocytes. The translocation of PLC-gamma 1 was specific for EGF stimulation, because a similar effect was not observed with insulin or vasopressin. EGF caused a transient increase of PLC activity in the cytoskeleton fraction which could be abolished by immunoprecipitating PLC-gamma 1. Tyrosine phosphorylated PLC-gamma 1 was seen only in the cytoskeleton fraction, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation is required for PLC-gamma 1 translocation to the cytoskeleton. This process may involve binding of PLC-gamma 1 to actin filaments, since actin was immunoprecipitated together with PLC-gamma 1 in the cytoskeleton after EGF treatment. EGF-induced translocation of PLC-gamma 1 to the cytoskeleton was not inhibited by pertussis toxin, but Gi alpha was translocated in an EGF-dependent manner, suggesting that the interaction of PLC-gamma 1 with its activated Gi-protein is downstream from both PLC-gamma 1 tyrosine phosphorylation and its translocation to the cytoskeleton. Taken together, the present studies indicate that EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1, its association with the cytoskeleton, and its interaction with activated Gi alpha protein are all obligatory for PLC-gamma 1 activation in hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1517617657,"Linoleic (9(Z),12(Z)-octadecadienoic) acid is oxidized by sperm whale myoglobin and H2O2 to an 84:16 (9S):(9R) enantiomer mixture of 9-hydroperoxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid. Neither the 9,10- nor 12,13-epoxide of linoleic acid, nor 9-hydroxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic nor 13-hydroperoxy-9(Z),11(E)-octadeca-dienoic acids, is detectably formed. Incubations with [(11R)-2H]- and [(11S)-2H]linoleic acids indicate that the pro-R hydrogen is abstracted 76% of the time. An H64V mutant in which access to the heme crevice is increased oxidizes linoleic acid exclusively by abstraction of the pro-R hydrogen to give the (9S)-hydroperoxide. Spectroscopic studies show that the Kd value for binding of linoleic acid to myoglobin is similar to the Km value for its oxidation and indicate that linoleic acid reduces the ferryl species to the ferric state. The stereochemical results, supported by 18O-labeling studies, definitively rule out a significant role for singlet oxygen in the myoglobin-catalyzed, H2O2-dependent oxidation of linoleic acid. The myoglobin protein radical formed with H2O2 also plays no part in the reaction because the Km and Vmax values for the oxidation of linoleic acid are similar for native myoglobin and two mutants (K102Q/Y103F/Y146F/Y151F and H64V/K102Q/Y103F/Y146F/Y151F) with no tyrosine residues. Furthermore, the rate of formation of the 9-hydroperoxide is not changed if the protein radical is allowed to decay before linoleic acid is added. The results establish that linoleic acid is oxidized within the heme crevice by reaction with the ferryl oxygen rather than a protein radical. They indicate, furthermore, that hydrogen abstraction and oxygen addition occur in an antarafacial manner and suggest a specific model for binding of linoleic acid within the myoglobin active site."
https://openalex.org/W2140409570,"Luminal and cytosolic Ca2+ control the sensitivity of the intracellular Ca2+ stores to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). In this work, we have characterized how luminal Ca2+ interfered with the stimulation of the InsP3 receptor by cytosolic Ca2+ in permeabilized A7r5 smooth muscle cells. InsP3-induced Ca2+ release from stores containing 34 pmol of Ca2+/10(6) cells absolutely depended on a simultaneous rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in the submicromolar range. This stimulation by cytosolic Ca2+ was more pronounced when the stores were preincubated with Ca2+. In contrast, fully loaded stores containing 3400 pmol of Ca2+/10(6) cells already responded to InsP3 in the absence of cytosolic Ca2+ and the release from these stores was much less stimulated by increasing the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. The loading dependence of the release was not due to a higher cytosolic Ca2+ concentration around more loaded stores sensitizing the InsP3 receptor by binding at a cytoplasmic site. Luminal Ca2+ was therefore found to functionally substitute for cytosolic Ca2+ in triggering Ca2+ release in the presence of a constant InsP3 concentration. These findings are relevant for explaining base-line Ca2+ spiking in non-excitable cells."
https://openalex.org/W1553797204,"Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis proceeds via the formation and degradation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates. Ubiquitin (Ub)-activating enzyme (E1) catalyzes the first, MgATP-dependent step in the conjugative reaction sequence. With wild type ubiquitin, the product of the E1 reaction is a ternary complex (E1-Ub-AMP-Ub) containing one thiol-linked ubiquitin (via the Ub COOH terminus, Gly-76) and one tightly bound ubiquitin adenylate. The thiol-linked ubiquitin is subsequently transferred to the thiol of a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2 protein); the latter adduct is the proximal donor of ubiquitin to the target protein. A mutant ubiquitin, bearing a Gly to Ala substitution at the COOH terminus (G76A-ubiquitin), was characterized as a substrate for E1. G76A-ubiquitin 1) supported PPi-ATP exchange poorly (500-fold decrease in kcat/K(m); 2) did not produce detectable AMP-Ub with native E1; 3) produced stoichiometric AMP-Ub with thiol-blocked E1; 4) gave a stoichiometric burst of ATP consumption (1 mol/mol E1) with either native or thiol-blocked E1; 5) supported E1-ubiquitin thiol ester formation with native E1; 6) supported several downstream reactions of the proteolytic pathway at approximately 20% of the rate of wild type ubiquitin. These results indicate that G76A-ubiquitin gives a binary E1 thiol ester complex with native E1, due to the failure of the E1-ubiquitin thiol ester to undergo another round of adenylate synthesis; thus AMP-Ub is detected only if adenylate to thiol transfer is prevented by alkylating E1. The inability of G76A-ubiquitin to support ternary complex formation has implications for E1 active site structure. In other experiments, occupancy of the nucleotide/adenylate site of E1, by either MgATP or AMP-Ub, was found to stimulate ubiquitin transthiolation between E1 and E2 proteins. The intermediacy of ubiquitin adenylate thus provides a previously unrecognized catalytic advantage in the E1 mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2151358879,"Two size forms of the class B N-type calcium channel alpha 1 subunit were recently identified with CNB1, an antipeptide antibody directed against an intracellular loop of this channel (Westenbroek, R.E., Hell, J.W., Warner, C., Dubel, S.J., Snutch, T.P., and Catterall, W.A. (1992) Neuron 9, 1099-1115). To investigate the biochemical differences between these two size forms, the antibodies CNB3 and CNB4 were raised against peptides with sequences corresponding to the COOH-terminal end of the full-length form. Immunoblot experiments demonstrated that both antibodies specifically recognize the longer form of 250 kDa, indicating that the COOH-terminal regions of the two size forms of the class B N-type channel alpha 1 subunit are different. Phosphorylation experiments with immunopurified calcium channels and different second messenger-activated protein kinases revealed that both the 220- and 250-kDa forms of the class B N-type calcium channel alpha 1 subunit are substrates for cAMP-dependent protein kinase, cGMP-dependent protein kinase, and protein kinase C. These three kinases incorporated approximately 1 mol of phosphate/mol of binding sites for omega-conotoxin (omega-CgTx) GVIA, a ligand specific for the N-type calcium channel, and may regulate the activity of both forms in vivo. In contrast, calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) phosphorylated only the long form of the class B N-type calcium channel alpha 1 subunit, with a stoichiometry of 0.5 mol of phosphate/mol of total omega-CgTx GVIA binding sites. Specific phosphorylation of the long form of the class B alpha 1 subunit by CaM kinase II may differentially regulate the function of N-type calcium channels containing different size forms of their alpha 1 subunits in vivo."

Four compounds were obtained which were analyzed by monosaccharide analysis, one- and two-dimensional 500 and 600 MHz 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, methylation analysis, gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. For all glycopeptides we propose the following glycan structure with galactose as the linkage sugar. [formula: see text] The isolated glycopeptides resulted from Pronase cleavage at the glycosylated tyrosine residues. Tyrosine was found as the linkage amino acid in all fractions but the remaining amino acid sequences varied, indicating the presence of different glycosylation sites in the intact S-layer glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W2120399350,"The calmodulin binding domain of the type I adenylyl cyclase has recently been identified as an amino acid sequence (residues 495-522) that contains 2 cysteine residues. Therefore, we examined the effect of several sulfhydryl reagents on the calmodulin sensitivity of the enzyme. Treatment of membranes containing the type I adenylyl cyclase with N-ethylmaleimide rapidly inhibited basal, calcium/calmodulin-stimulated, and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. When the enzyme was treated with limiting amounts of o-iodosobenzoate, which oxidizes vicinal sulfhydryls to disulfides, stimulation by Ca2+ and calmodulin was eliminated at concentrations which did not affect basal adenylyl cyclase activity. Calmodulin stimulation of the enzyme was restored by treatment with dithiothreitol or glutathione which reduce disulfides to free thiols. NO and sodium nitroprusside also reversible inhibited calmodulin stimulation of the enzyme. We propose that the loss in calmodulin sensitivity caused by these reagents may be due to the oxidation one or more sets of vicinal thiols present in the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1566146550,"To search for peptides which serve as substrates for protein kinases, an approach based on peptide libraries has been developed. These peptide libraries are chemically synthesized by a modified divide-couple-recombine strategy. After reaction with the kinase of interest, the most highly phosphorylated substrate (selected from the library) is identified using on-line liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ESMS). Negative ion LC-ESMS with stepped collision energy is used to identify phosphorylated peptides in the enzyme reactions. As predicted, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase is shown to preferentially phosphorylate Kemptide (Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly) in a library consisting of 19 variants of Kemptide substituted at position 2. Additional experiments have been carried out on the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase v-Abl using a peptide library based on the v-Src autophosphorylation site (Arg-Arg-Leu-Ile-Glu-Asp-Ala-Glu-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Arg-Gly). These results indicate that Ile is the optimal residue at the position N-terminal to tyrosine. Individual peptides containing the Glu-Asp-Ala-Ile-Tyr motif have Vmax/Km values 6-fold higher than the peptide based on the autophosphorylation site itself, confirming the results of the library experiments. This motif has been identified in several tyrosine kinases at a position in the sequence not previously reported to serve as a phosphorylation or autophosphorylation site."
https://openalex.org/W1483516617,"The INO2 locus encodes a novel product showing structural similarity to the basic helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) family of regulatory proteins (Nikoloff, D.M., McGraw, P., and Henry, S.A. (1992) Nucleic Acids Res. 20, 3253). The ino2 mutants exhibit pleiotropic defects in phospholipid metabolism including inability to derepress the biosynthetic enzyme inositol-1-phosphate synthase. Localization of mutations in ino2 strains has demonstrated that the b-HLH domain is required for biological activity and is sensitive to perturbation, thereby establishing a correlation between the structure and function of Ino2p. Defects in the b-HLH domain of Ino2p resulted in reduced DNA binding activity. In addition, the absence of a specific DNA-protein complex correlated with a reduction or loss of INO1 transcription. Studies using Ino2p-specific antibody revealed that Ino2p participates in the formation of specific DNA-protein complexes. Ino2p-dependent binding activity overlapped with a region of the INO1 promoter that contains two potential HLH consensus binding sites. Furthermore, Ino2p showed single base pair discrimination in a putative binding site, establishing a relationship between Ino2p and its target binding site."
https://openalex.org/W204263419,"A 37-year-old man was found to have an inherited abnormal factor VII (FVII) (designated FVIINagoya) that has a lower FVII procoagulant activity when tested in a one-stage assay using rabbit, simian, or human tissue factor (TF), but surprisingly has a nearly normal activity using bovine TF. DNA sequence analysis of the propositus' FVII gene revealed a C to T mutation that results in a novel amino acid substitution of Arg304 to Trp. Restriction enzyme analysis of the amplified fragment obtained from each family member demonstrated that the patient is homozygous for the point mutation, and the mother and sister of the patient are heterozygous for this mutation. To elucidate the abnormality in FVIINagoya, we compared the recombinant mutant FVII with normal FVII. In the presence of human TF, kinetic analyses demonstrated that the apparent Km values of FVIINagoya for factor Xa-mediated FVII activation and for FVIIa-mediated factor X (FX) activation were 3.6- and 4.5-fold higher than those of normal FVII, respectively. The ligand binding assay to human TF also showed that FVIINagoya had a 5.2-fold larger apparent Kd than normal. In the presence of bovine TF, however, these values showed no difference between normal and mutant FVII. These findings indicate that the major abnormality in FVIINagoya is not a catalytic dysfunction but an impaired complex-formation of human TF.FVII.FX, suggesting the importance of Arg304 in the interaction with human TF."
https://openalex.org/W1538224260,"The role of the transferrin receptor in capturing and conveying transferrin through the cell during the iron-donating cycle of receptor-mediated endocytosis has been studied extensively. Nevertheless, almost nothing is known of how human transferrin binds to its receptor. In an initial approach toward delineating the receptor-recognition site(s) of human transferrin, we have studied the interactions of proteolytically-cleaved, single-sited fragments of transferrin, representing the N- and C-lobes of the molecule respectively, with cells expressing the transferrin receptor on their plasma membranes. Only the C-fragment was found capable of donating iron to hepatoma-derived HuH-7 cells or of binding to surface receptors of HuH-7 and leukemic K562 cells. Although no association of N- and C-fragments could be demonstrated by gel chromatography, the presence of excess N-fragment strengthened the binding of C-fragment by an order of magnitude. An explanation of these observations is that the primary receptor recognition site of human transferrin is on the C-lobe of the protein, but that prior binding of this lobe to receptor enables the N-lobe to respond to receptor as well, either directly or by interaction with the bound C-lobe."
https://openalex.org/W1656503843,"The catalytic domain of Schizosaccharomyces pombe casein kinase-1 (the product of the cki1 gene) has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified by chromatographic methods, characterized in vitro, and crystallized in the presence and absence of nucleotide substrate. The best crystals belong to the trigonal space group P3(1)21 or its enantiomorph, have unit cell parameters a = b = 79 A, c = 121 A, and diffract x-rays to 2.0-A resolution. Kinetic characterization of the purified catalytic domain and other C-terminal deletion mutants of Cki1 suggests that it is subject to two forms of regulation. One mechanism involves autophosphorylation, and results in a 4-fold decrease in the affinity for protein substrate. In contrast, truncation of intact Cki1 results in a 3-fold activation in its catalytic rate. This activation may arise from the removal of an inhibitory domain present in the intact enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1808103229,"Chlorella pyrenoidosa was grown in steady-state continuous cultures in either high or low light. Samples of these cultures were incubated in darkness (violaxanthin state) or in saturating light (zeaxanthin state). These samples were kept in the respective preadapted states throughout the entire photodamage treatment. Photodamage involved exposure to single-turnover flashes fired at a low (non-actinic) frequency. The damage caused by the light stress thus applied was monitored by changes in photosynthetic properties and pigment composition. Cells preadapted in the light resisted photodamage better than those kept in darkness. The low light grown cells were more vulnerable to photodamage than the high light grown cells. Our experimental approach permitted the equilibria between the components that participate in the xanthophyll cycle to be set without addition of inhibitors. Regardless of the total amount of violaxanthin being present, its conversion to anthera- and zeaxanthin is a prerequisite for protection. The protection is most effective for photosystem II. It appeared that antheraxanthin accumulates as a result of photodamaging flashes provided that these are fired in the presence of background light, i.e. with zeaxanthin present. From this, it is newly derived that the xanthophyll cycle operates in full in the light, including epoxidation of zeaxanthin. The latter conversion was also demonstrated in vitro, via nonenzymatic oxygen-dependent turnover of zeaxanthin into violaxanthin."
https://openalex.org/W1531270254,"Abstract In order to elucidate the role of the aromatic ring in recognition of the sugar ring, Trp-62 of hen egg white lysozyme, which is proposed on the basis of x-ray crystallography data to make contact with a sugar ring through van der Waals interaction, was replaced with aliphatic amino acids (Leu, Ile, Val, and Ala) and Gly by site-directed mutagenesis. In spite of the loss of the aromatic effect, these mutant lysozymes, except for the Trp-62-->Gly mutant, showed higher bacteriolytic activity than the wild-type lysozyme. Furthermore, the Trp-62-->Gly mutant still retained appreciable bacteriolytic activity. On the other hand, by these replacements, the enzymatic activities toward non-charged substrates were markedly reduced. Additionally, the side-chain structure of position 62 was found to be largely responsible for recognition of a saccharide ring in its active site cleft. NMR analysis of the Trp-62-->Leu and Trp-62-->Gly mutants indicated that the structural effects of Trp-62 replacements were localized in the loop region around position 62 and the part of the beta-sheet containing the hydrogen bonding network important for enzymatic activity. Thus, we conclude that Trp-62 not only interacts with oligosaccharide through van der Waals contact, but also maintains the local structural conformation to produce the lysozyme-oligosaccharide interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1561342323,"The reaction of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) with high density lipoproteins (HDL) is of critical importance in reverse cholesterol transport. We studied the relationship between LCAT binding and HDL composition using two assays to determine LCAT binding affinity for discoidal reconstituted HDL (rHDL). We prepared rHDL with egg phosphatidylcholine (egg-PC), cholesterol, and either apolipoprotein (apo) A-I or apoA-II. The rHDL, identical in lipid content, had sizes of 96 and 100 A, respectively. Binding constants (Kd) determined by the activity-inhibition method were 2.2 +/- 0.3 x 10(-7) and 1.1 +/- 0.3 x 10(-16) M, whereas those determined by a solid-phase method were 3.3 +/- 0.9 x 10(-7) and 3.7 +/- 0.9 x 10(-7) M for apoA-I and apoA-II rHDL, respectively. The stoichiometry was 1 LCAT bound/rHDL. The appVmax/appKm for apoA-I was 80-fold higher than for apoA-II rHDL. The large difference between LCAT-binding constants and enzymatic activity measurements for the two particles suggests that LCAT binding and activation by apolipoproteins are independent events. To determine the effects of phospholipid headgroup on LCAT binding affinity, we tested rHDL containing up to 16 mol % of egg phosphatidylethanolamine (egg-PE), egg phosphatidic acid (egg-PA), or bovine phosphatidylserine (PS). Kd was unchanged for PS rHDL, but increased 6-fold with increasing PE content. AppVmax increased with PE content, but decreased with PS or PA relative to egg-PC controls. AppKm increased in PE rHDL, but remained unchanged in rHDL with PA or PS. Fluorescence characterization of the lipid domains of rHDL shows small differences in the polarity of the headgroup region of PE rHDL. Thus, LCAT binding is influenced by the lipid, but not the protein composition of rHDL. AppVmax values reflect active site preferences, while appKm values reflect interfacial binding affinity."
https://openalex.org/W2109364945,"The short chain dehydrogenase gene ltdh, which is derived from the H locus of Leishmania, confers high level resistance to the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor methotrexate via a novel mechanism. Resistance is correlated with LTDH overproduction. High level resistance of ltdh transfectants was observed even in poor media where reduced folates are essential for the synthesis of thymidylate precursors. The ltdh transfectants were also capable of growing for several passages, at slightly reduced rates, in unsupplemented folate-deficient medium (fdDME-L), unlike the wild-type cells that could grow only in fdDME-L if supplemented with various folates or pterins. An homozygous ltdh mutant was obtained by gene targeting. This mutant became hypersensitive to methotrexate, but unlike wild-type cells, methotrexate toxicity could not be circumvented by the addition of thymidine. Although the homozygous mutant was capable of growing in fdDME-L supplemented with folate derivatives, it lost its ability to thrive in fdDME-L supplemented with pterins. Our results support the model in which LTDH is a key enzyme responsible for the conversion of a pterin derivative into an essential cofactor. This essential cofactor can also be converted into reduced folates at sufficient levels for growth when LTDH is overproduced, rendering dihydrofolate reductase dispensable. The novelty and uniqueness of LTDH opens the possibility of developing parasite-specific inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1586137038,"The thermodynamics of the nitrogenase reactions are discussed in terms of chemical equations and biochemical equations. Chemical equations balance all elements and electric charge. Biochemical equations represent changes at specified pH and specified free concentrations of metal ions that are bound by reactants, but they do not balance hydrogen or metal ions that have specified free concentrations. At a specified pH, it takes three separate biochemical equations to represent the changes catalyzed by nitrogenase. [formula; see text] The first two equations are required because the nitrogenase and hydrogenase activities of the enzyme have not been separated. The hydrolysis of ATP is necessary, but it is not coupled stoichiometrically to the first two equations. The function of the hydrolysis of ATP by nitrogenase may be to provide the 10 H+ required per mol of N2 consumed. However, reactions cannot generally be coupled stoichiometrically through H+ because H+ is potentially available by dissociation of protein, buffer, and H2O. The standard Gibbs energies of formation of the reactant species are calculated for 25 degrees C, 1 bar, and ionic strengths of 0 and 0.25 M. The standard transformed Gibbs energies of formation of the reactants are calculated at 25 degrees C, 1 bar, pH 7, and ionic strengths of 0 and 0.25 M."
https://openalex.org/W1526309719,"Are 5-methylcytosine residues in DNA hot spots for transition mutagenesis? Numerous studies identify 1) structural changes induced by DNA methylation, 2) high percentages of human mutations that result from GC to AT transition pathways, and 3) differences between G.C and G.mC base pairs in susceptibility to nonenzymatic deamination. However, investigations of chemical stability necessarily involve non-physiological conditions for chemical analysis of deamination. Here we describe an experiment that compares rates of deamination-induced mutagenesis between a G.C and G.mC base pair, when both are present in duplex DNA, incubated at 37 degrees C and pH 7.4, within identical sequence contexts, in a natural mutational target (the Escherichia coli lacZ alpha gene) that selects for mutagenesis at the specific site under investigation. Under these conditions the rate of spontaneous deamination at G.mC exceeds that at G.C by more than 21-fold. Our data implicate differences in chemical stability toward deamination as a major causal factor releasing DNA cytosine methylation to spontaneous mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1603453266,"A transferrin-independent iron transport system in cells containing transferrin receptors was described previously by several investigators. Prior studies did not identify the proteins involved in this alternate iron transport pathway. Using a human-derived erythroleukemia tissue culture line, iron-binding proteins were isolated from cytosol and cell membranes. The cytosol protein was soluble in 60% ammonium sulfate, had a molecular mass similar to mobilferrin (56 kDa), and reacted with anti-mobilferrin antibodies. The water-insoluble radiolabeled protein was solubilized with Nonidet P-40 and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody against beta 3 human integrin. Pulse-chase studies suggested sequential passage of iron to integrin, mobilferrin, and ferritin, respectively. Thus, the alternate iron transport pathway contained proteins similar to those observed in intestinal cells which did not possess transferrin receptors on their absorptive surface. The alternate iron transport pathway is only partially shared with zinc and cadmium. Mobilferrin bound zinc and iron competitively, but the two metals were not transported competitively into K562 cells. Immunoprecipitates of integrin containing radiozinc were obtained with a monoclonal antibody against beta 1 human integrin. This suggested iron and zinc may utilize different integrins to passage the cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2002788937,"NF1 is a family of polypeptides that binds to discrete DNA motifs and plays varying roles in the regulation of gene expression. These polypeptides are also thought to mediate the expression of differentiation-specific markers such as adipocyte and mammary cell type-specific genes. The expression of a number of cellular differentiation-specific markers is down-regulated during neoplastic transformation. We therefore investigated whether oncogenic transformation interferes with the action of NF1. Stable transfection of activated Ha-ras into a number of murine cells correlated with a down-regulation of the expression of the NF1 genes NF1/CTF and NF1/X. The down-regulation was not at the transcriptional level but at the level of stability of the NF1 mRNAs. The level of the DNA binding activity of the NF1 proteins was also reduced in Ha-v-ras-transformed cells, and the expression of a gene that depends on this family of transcription factors was specifically repressed. These results demonstrate that an activated Ha-ras-induced pathway destabilizes the half-life of mRNAs encoding specific members in the NF1 family of transcription factors, which leads to a decrease in NF1-dependent gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1594354817,"Angiotensin II has been shown to induce hypertrophy of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). To understand the mechanisms of induction of the hypertrophy, we studied its effect on the phosphorylation state of eIF-4E, a rate-limiting eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor whose activity has been shown to be regulated by phosphorylation. Angiotensin II induced a 2-3-fold increase in the phosphorylation of eIF-4E in VSMC. The stimulation of phosphorylation was apparent at 20 min and persisted for at least 12 h. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that serine is the major residue of eIF-4E phosphorylated by angiotensin II. Staurosporine and calphostin C, two potent inhibitors of the serine/threonine protein kinase, protein kinase C, significantly attenuated the angiotensin II-induced eIF-4E phosphorylation. Staurosporine and calphostin C also blunted the angiotensin II-stimulated protein synthesis. Together, these observations indicate that angiotensin II induces phosphorylation of eIF-4E in a protein kinase C-dependent manner and suggest that this pathway may play an important role in the mechanism by which angiotensin II causes hypertrophy of VSMC."
https://openalex.org/W1807013767,"TGN38 and TGN41 are isoforms of an integral membrane protein (TGN38/41) which is predominantly located in the trans-Golgi network of mammalian cells, but which constitutively recycles between the TGN and the plasma membrane. The cytoplasmic domain tetrapeptide sequence YQRL is responsible for the internalization of TGN38/41 from the plasma membrane. This sequence conforms to the tyrosine containing internalization motif (YXXhydro, where X is any amino acid and hydro is any large bulky hydrophobic amino acid) found in other integral membrane proteins which are internalized from the plasma membrane via clathrin-coated vesicles. Structural predictions have suggested that the YXXhydro motif might adopt a tight turn structure in solution, a prediction supported previously by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies on short synthetic peptides corresponding to variants of the generic YXXhydro motif. We have synthesized a 21-amino acid peptide which encompasses the TGN38/41 internalization motif and used it as template for two-dimensional NMR analysis. The data from these experiments demonstrate that the internalization motif in the cytoplasmic domain of TGN38/41 lies within a nascent helix, not a tight turn. This is the first study to show that tyrosine containing internalization motifs do not necessarily adopt a beta-turn conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1488194248,"The uncoupling protein is one of a family of mitochondrial transport proteins involved in energy metabolism. It dissipates oxidative energy to generate heat, either by catalyzing proton transport directly or by catalyzing fatty acid anion transport, thus enabling fatty acids to act as cycling protonophores. This transport process is tightly regulated by purine nucleotides. We have expressed uncoupling protein in yeast and examined its proton transport activity after its reconstitution into proteoliposomes. A directed change of Arg276 to Leu or Gln completely abolished nucleotide inhibition of protonophoretic action of the reconstituted mutant uncoupling proteins without affecting the transport process. Arg276 is the first residue of functional importance to be identified in uncoupling protein. Mutation of the homologous residue in the yeast ADP/ATP translocator prevented the growth of yeast on a nonfermentable carbon source, presumably by interfering with nucleotide exchange (Nelson, D. R., Lawson, J. E., Klingenberg, M., and Douglas, M. G. (1993) J. Mol. Biol. 230, 1159-1170). Demonstration of the essential role of a single homologous residue in protein-nucleotide interaction within these two transporters is the first direct evidence that uncoupling protein and the ADP/ATP translocator belong to the same gene family."
https://openalex.org/W1654164439,"The catalytic subunit of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) reductase, DmsA, contains six blocks of sequence that are homologous to other members of the superfamily of prokaryotic molybdoenzymes. The amino-terminal block contains 5 conserved residues (Cys38, Cys42, Cys75, Lys28, and Arg77). Site-directed mutagenesis of these residues did not alter membrane localization but in some cases less enzyme accumulated. The activity of Me2SO reductase was monitored by measuring Me2SO-dependent anaerobic growth, benzyl viologen, or dimethylnaphthoquinol oxidase activity, and using a quinol pool-coupling assay. Only Cys75 and Lys28 mutant enzymes were able to support anaerobic growth with Me2SO suggesting a critical role for Cys38, Cys42, and Arg77. Benzyl viologen oxidase activity was retained in the mutants although with reduced efficiency in Cys42-Ser. Electron transport with dimethylnaphthoquinol was reduced in Cys38-Ser, Cys42-Ser, and Cys75-Ser and almost totally eliminated in the Arg77-Ser mutant. Cys38-Ser, Cys42-Ser, and Arg77-Ser were unable to support quinol oxidation although electron transfer from the quinol pool to the [Fe-S] centers in DmsB was normal. These results indicate that the amino-terminal region is involved in functional electron transfer from the quinol pool to Me2SO and that electrons from benzyl viologen, dimethylnaphthoquinol, and menaquinol may follow different paths within the catalytic subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1485731909,"Results are presented demonstrating that the backbone of the active site lysine of bacteriorhodopsin undergoes light-induced structural alterations during bacteriorhodopsin-mediated light-induced proton pumping. This conclusion is based on difference Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of isotopically labeled bacteriorhodopsin. The data demonstrate that the backbone carbonyl of lysine achieves an extremely low vibrational frequency during M412 intermediate formation. This is preceded by a structural transition in the lysine backbone that leads to an active site lysine carbonyl with the observed low vibrational frequency, probably due to a high degree of solvation."
https://openalex.org/W1520427079,"Single turnover experiments were performed on myosin-bound ADP by measuring the time course of incorporation of [3H]ADP following rapid formation of [3H]ATP by photolysis of caged [3H]ATP. Permeabilized rabbit portal veins were incubated in a solution at 20 degrees C with 1 mM MgATP, 20 mM phosphocreatine, 1 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and containing [14C]ATP and high specific activity caged [3H]ATP. At variable times following a UV flash, the muscle was frozen, nucleotides were extracted, and the ratio 3H:14C in ADP was compared to that in ATP. At rest, the exchange of bound ADP occurred with a rate constant of 0.004 s-1. When the myosin light chain was about 80% thiophosphorylated, and the muscle was generating maximum isometric force, there appeared a fast phase of ADP exchange (44% of the total) which had a rate constant of 0.2 s-1. The change in rate of ADP exchange on myosin is sufficient to explain the measured increase in ATPase activity upon thiophosphorylation of the myosin light chain. A simple analysis of the data suggests that there is a 50-fold increase in the cycling rate of cross-bridges in the muscle upon phosphorylation under isometric conditions. The fraction of ADP exchanged at 10 s following photolytic release of [3H]ATP was found to be approximately linearly related to the degree of thiophosphorylation of the myosin light chain. This supports the idea that phosphorylation of the light chain causes the transition of myosin from the resting (slow ATPase) cycle into the activated (fast ATPase) cycle, and that the fraction of myosin in the fast cycle is directly determined by the degree of light chain phosphorylation. The data are also consistent with the cooperativity model described previously by Vyas et al."
https://openalex.org/W1560026359,"In the presence of plasma, the osmotic differential required to trigger lysis of large unilamellar vesicles is significantly decreased with the membrane tension at rupture being reduced from about 36 to about 12 dynes/cm for vesicles composed of palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine: cholesterol (55:45). Despite increasing vesicle sensitivity, however, plasma does not alter the characteristics of osmotically induced lysis. As in the absence of plasma, lysis is not an all-or-nothing event but instead results in only partial loss of intravesicular solute, so that following membrane resealing the vesicle interior remains hyperosmotic with respect to the external medium. To identify the component responsible for the observed increase in vesicle osmotic sensitivity, plasma was fractionated by density centrifugation. Albumin and other soluble plasma proteins, including those associated with the complement system, were found to exert only a modest influence on vesicle osmotic behavior. In contrast all of the lipoprotein fractions lowered vesicle tolerance to osmotic pressure, with high density lipoprotein exerting an effect comparable to whole plasma."
https://openalex.org/W181922276,"Macrophage-like RAW 264 and H35 hepatoma cells grown under serum-free conditions exported putrescine and an unidentified diamine into the culture medium. Unlike putrescine, the unknown compound could be detected only extracellularly. Analyses of dansylated polyamine standards and mass spectroscopy confirmed that the unknown compound was cadaverine (1,5-diaminopentane). The cells were free of mycoplasma as evidenced by a negative result using a probe specific for prokaryotic rRNA. After prophylactic treatments with two different mycoplasmacidal agents, the cells continued to export cadaverine. Attempts to infect a noncadaverine-exporting cell line with culture medium and cell-free lysates proved unsuccessful, establishing that cadaverine was in fact a bona fide product of these mammalian cells. Cadaverine export by RAW 264 and H35 cells was stimulated by lipopolysaccharide and insulin, respectively. However, administration of exogenous ornithine caused cadaverine export to decrease significantly with concomitant increases in putrescine export. alpha-Difluoromethylornithine, a selective inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, inhibited both cadaverine and putrescine export. When cells were labeled with [3H]lysine, the great majority of the radioactivity recovered in exported polyamines was found in cadaverine. The cumulative data suggested that cadaverine formation may be caused by the action of intracellular ornithine decarboxylase upon lysine to produce cadaverine, which is then effluxed from the cell with a high degree of efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1571324325,"Serum starvation and readdition of serum, insulin, or mitogens result in changes in phosphorylation of several eukaryotic initiation factors that correlate with a decrease or stimulation in translation, respectively. We have introduced in vitro synthesized reporter mRNAs into exponentially growing and serum-deprived 3T3-L1 cells to examine whether serum deprivation affects cap-dependent translation. In serum-fed control cells, addition of a cap to poly(A)- or poly(A)+ mRNA increased translational efficiency by 43- and 460-fold, respectively. In serum-deprived cells, the relative rate of translational efficiency of capped mRNA was reduced 2.6-fold relative from that observed in serum-fed cells with little change in the relative functional half-life. The effect of serum deprivation on translation was rapid and occurred within 90 min, and cap function was restored upon addition of serum or insulin to starved cells. Analysis of the dose dependence for reversal of the effects of serum starvation on cap-dependent translation indicated that 10 nM insulin was optimal. Little change in the function of the poly(A) tail was observed during serum starvation or hormone treatment. However, a decrease in the synergism between the cap and a poly(A) tail was observed upon starvation which was reversed by serum, and in part, by insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1505899335,"The Lys-480 in the alpha-subunits of Na+,K(+)-ATPase from pig kidneys was specifically modified with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) or pyridoxal 5'-diphospho-5'-adenosine (AP2PL) probes in the presence of NaCl. The site was shown to be the same as the ATP-protectable binding of these probes (Hinz, H.R., and Kirley, T.L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10260-10265). Modifications strongly reduced both Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity and the amount of Na(+)-dependent phosphoenzyme from [32P]ATP but not from [32P]acetyl-phosphate (AcP). Addition of AcP to the enzyme induced a slight decrease in the fluorescence of the PLP probe in the presence of 2 M NaCl and 4 mM MgCl2 but a single exponential increase in the presence of 16 mM NaCl and 4 mM MgCl2. The addition of ATP induced single exponential fluorescence increases at both Na+ concentrations. The data show that these probes can sense molecular events related to the formation of phosphoenzymes induced by AcP and presumably to the formation of Mg-Na-ATP-enzyme complex. The data also suggest that PLP or AP2PL probes at Lys-480 in the presence of Na+ and Mg2+ do not affect the transphosphorylation from AcP to Asp-369 to form phosphoenzymes but that they inhibit the transphosphorylation from the gamma-phosphoryl group of ATP and also ATP binding in the absence of Mg2+."
https://openalex.org/W1545362265,"L-Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) catalyzes the one-step biosynthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is widely accepted as the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. In this paper, we report the identification and purification of a new and novel form of peripheral membrane GAD (MGAD) referred to as MGADIII, using a combination of chromatography on DE52, AcA 34, hydroxylapatite and Sephadex G-200, and native gel electrophoresis. The purified MGADIII migrated as a single protein band on a native 5-25% gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent molecular mass of 118 +/- 6 and 60 +/- 4 kDa, respectively, suggesting that it is a homodimer of 60 kDa. MGADIII was established as a Ca(2+)-dependent peripheral membrane protein based on Triton X-114 phase partitioning assay, liposome binding experiment, and membrane extraction studies. Several lines of evidence are presented to show that the association of MGADIII with membranes occurs during depolarization of nerve terminal and that this is a reversible process. Based on these results and previous findings that GAD associates with synaptic vesicles and is regulated by phosphorylation, a model for regulation of GAD in the nerve terminal is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1543116608,"The human interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) was differentially expressed on IL-6-dependent (U266 and SKO-007) and -independent (RPMI8226) myeloma cells as well as melanoma cells (A375-C6) that are growth-inhibited by IL-6. U266 and SKO-007 cells expressed four distinct IL-6R complexes (molecular masses of 100, 120, 145, and 165 kDa) as revealed by affinity cross-linking of iodinated IL-6. RPMI8226 and A375-C6 cells primarily expressed the 165-kDa complex relative to the others. Immunoprecipitation and antibody competition studies showed that the 100- and 120-kDa complexes contained the gp80 subunit, whereas the 145- and 165-kDa complexes contained the gp130 subunit of the IL-6R. Assaying solubilized U266 plasma membrane proteins by affinity cross-linking or ligand blotting revealed that only gp80 bound IL-6 specifically. Induction of an IL-6 response was associated with ligand-induced down-regulation of gp130 and was inhibited by neutralizing anti-IL-6 antibodies. Furthermore, the relative ratios of gp80 to gp130 determined the binding kinetics of the IL-6R, yielding high- and low-affinity binding sites by Scatchard plots. Our data imply that distinct IL-6 bioactivities are based upon the differential expression and regulation by IL-6 of its ligand-binding (gp80) and signal-transducing (gp130) receptor subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1593499821,"The specificity and active site properties of vitamin B6 phosphatase purified from human erythrocytes were studied by kinetic analyses with vitamin B6 compounds and derivatives and chemical modification with group-specific reagents. The kinetic constants for pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), 4-pyridoxic acid phosphate, pyridoxine phosphate, and pyridoxamine phosphate were determined from pH 5 to 9. The values of Vmax/Km and pKm were highest for PLP and 4-pyridoxic acid phosphate and lowest for pyridoxamine phosphate. Vmax/Km and pKm for the four substrates were maximum between pH 6 and 8. Ionizable groups with pKa values about 6 and 8 affected substrate binding to the enzyme. Vmax values for all the substrates gradually decreased with increasing pH. The enzyme also catalyzed the dephosphorylation of 4'-secondary amine derivatives of vitamin B6-phosphate. The phosphatase had greatest catalytic efficiency with substrates that contained a negatively charged group on the 4'-position of the pyridine ring. It is concluded that there are one or two positively charged groups at the active site of the enzyme that interact with the substrate's phosphate ester and 4'-substituent. The phosphatase was inactivated by phenylglyoxal, and PLP protected the enzyme against this inactivation. Phenylglyoxal did not modify Lys or Cys residues or an alpha-amino group since the enzyme's NH2 terminus is blocked, and it did not affect the quaternary structure of the phosphatase. The enzyme was inactivated by the incorporation of 1 mol of phenylglyoxal/subunit. Diethylpyrocarbonate inactivated the enzyme by reacting with a group with a pKa of 6.7, and pyridoxine phosphate protected the enzyme against this inactivation. These data suggest that Arg and His residues are at or near the active site and may play roles in substrate binding and/or catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2163349034,"Lysine 68 of Bacillus stearothermophilus leucine dehydrogenase is highly conserved in the corresponding regions of NAD(P)+-dependent amino acid dehydrogenase sequences. To elucidate its functional role, the lysyl residue of the recombinant enzyme has been replaced with alanine or arginine by site-directed mutagenesis. Either mutation resulted in nearly complete loss of activity in the oxidative deamination, whereas only the mutation to alanine led to a marked increase in Michaelis constants for both amino and keto acid substrates. On the other hand, an ionizable group in the wild-type enzyme with a pKa value of 10.1-10.7, which must be protonated for binding of substrate and competitive inhibitor with an alpha-carboxyl group, was unobservable in both mutant enzymes. These results altogether led to the conclusion that Lys-68 is located at the active site of the enzyme and involved in binding of the alpha-carboxyl group of substrate through an ionic interaction. In addition, the alanine mutant enzyme that is almost inactive in the deamination but significantly active in the amination was greatly stimulated by exogenously added ammonia, suggesting that proper binding of the substrate alpha-carboxyl group at Lys-68 is essential for catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1585668627,"To better understand the early events of the mitochondrial protein import process, we purified the precursor of the F1-ATPase beta subunit (pre-F1 beta) and examined its import into isolated mitochondria. Import of purified urea-denatured pre-F1 beta did not require cytosolic factors. However, the period of productive import was prolonged by the addition of reticulocyte lysate, suggesting that cytosolic factors such as molecular chaperones were acting to extend the period of import competence of pre-F1 beta. Purified pre-F1 beta bound extensively to both cardiolipin-containing liposomes and to intact mitochondria, indicating that a direct interaction between mitochondrial precursors and the mitochondrial outer membrane surface can occur. The ability to chase this surface-bound pre-F1 beta into mitochondria suggests that precursors bound to the mitochondrial surface can be maintained in an import competent conformation. Finally, our defined mitochondrial import system was used to characterize the ATP requirements of pre-F1 beta import in the absence of cytosol. We found a strong requirement for ATP on both sides of the mitochondrial inner membrane, suggesting that one or more previously undetected mitochondrial proteins outside the inner membrane utilize ATP to promote efficient pre-F1 beta import."
https://openalex.org/W1585770833,"Abstract A conserved architectural feature of ribosomes is a protuberance (the stalk) in the large subunit, essential for ribosomal interactions with translational factors and GTP hydrolysis and generated by two dimers of L12, the only multicopy protein in ribosomes. In higher plants, the rpl12 gene for chloroplast L12 is located in the nucleus. We report here the cloning and sequencing of this nuclear gene from Arabidopsis thaliana, revealing the first gene family for a chloroplast ribosomal protein (RP). A single cluster/haploid genome of three rpl12 genes is located in the sequenced 9.1-kilobase region of the Arabidopsis genome. Two of the rpl12 genes encode identical mature proteins, and the third encodes a 25% divergent RP, although the chloroplast-targeting transit peptide in each is distinct. The rpl12 genes encoding identical RPs are closely linked at their 5' ends to identical cytosolic tRNA(Pro) genes with a < 250-base pair spacer. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction experiments with total RNA isolated from Arabidopsis (and characterization of several L12 cDNA clones) show that only the tRNA-linked rpl12 genes are expressed. We also show (by polymerase chain reaction experiments with isolated total DNA) that this tRNA(Pro)-rpl12 gene linkage is conserved in spinach (inferred to contain a single gene copy) indicating its importance. The previously described enhanced translation of spinach L12 mRNA from its two tandem AUG codons and the two functional rpl12 genes in Arabidopsis probably provide two mechanisms for generating the four copies of L12/chloroplast ribosome, qualitatively different from those attempted in eubacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1588315862,"Abstract All-trans-retinoic acid mediates cell growth and differentiation by binding to and then activating nuclear retinoid receptor proteins that regulate gene transcription. Recombinant human retinoic acid receptor beta was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein rMBP-RAR beta with maltose-binding protein to facilitate purification. After isolation from bacterial lysates, rMBP-RAR beta was used for binding with selected retinoids. Scatchard analysis with [11,12-3H2]all-trans-retinoic acid gave a Kd of 0.34 nM. Competitive binding studies with a series of conformationally restricted aromatic retinoids indicated that the Ki values for binding to rMBP-RAR beta correlated with the logs of the EC50 values for gene transcriptional activation (p < or = 0.05) and with those for the relative activation compared to that of all-trans-retinoic acid (p < or = 0.01). Inspection of binding-activation correlation diagrams indicates candidate structures for improved retinoid agonists or antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W1510980063,"The promoter region and the first four genes of the Escherichia coli proton-translocating ATPase (unc) operon, uncIBEF, were cloned into bacteriophage lambda, enabling this region to be recombined into an unc-deleted E. coli chromosome at the lambda att site. The resultant E. coli strain, carrying single-copy F0 genes, was tested for synthesis and assembly of functional F0 proton channels. Membranes isolated from this strain contained all three F0 subunits and were capable of binding purified F1 and reconstituting F1F0-dependent energy coupling activities. The presence of these F0 sectors did not affect cell growth or membrane proton permeability assayed by fluorescence quenching. When compared with wild type membranes, membranes from the single-copy F0 strain contained less a and b subunits. When the single-copy lambda F0 strain was transformed with an F1 plasmid, the cells became phenotypically and biochemically Unc+, with membrane-bound ATPase and ATP synthase activities that were 50-60% of wild type. The results demonstrate that F0 produced from single-copy genes in the absence of F1 is membrane-bound and functional (i.e. reconstitutable) but not freely permeable to protons. The presence of F1 genes and/or subunits during F0 synthesis and assembly both increases the relative amounts of membrane-bound a and b subunits and produces an F0 sector more like that found in wild type cells than is produced from the single-copy F0 genes alone."
