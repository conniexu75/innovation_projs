https://openalex.org/W1972009259,"The molecular mechanism by which the L1 cell adhesion molecule mediates neurite outgrowth has been examined. Purified L1 from mouse and L1 from chick brain were attached to nitrocellulose dishes. Both chick and mouse neurons were able to adhere to purified mouse L1 and chick L1. Both molecules promoted neurite extension from chick and mouse neurons. Addition of Fabs specific for chick L1 to the cultures inhibited chick neurite outgrowth on both mouse L1 and chick L1. These findings suggest that L1-like molecules support neurite outgrowth via a ""homophilic"" binding mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2072449837,"Using a laser microbeam to kill specific subsets of the pharyngeal nervous system of C. elegans, we found that feeding was accomplished by two separately controlled muscle motions, isthmus peristalsis and pumping. The single neuron M4 was necessary and sufficient for isthmus peristalsis. The MC neurons were necessary for normal stimulation of pumping in response to food, but pumping continued and was functional in MC- worms. The remaining 12 neuron types were also unnecessary for functional pumping. No operation we did, including destruction of the entire pharyngeal nervous system, abolished pumping altogether. When we killed all pharyngeal neurons except M4, the worms were viable and fertile, although retarded and starved. Since feeding is one of the few known essential actions controlled by the nervous system, we suggest that most of the C. elegans nervous system is dispensable in hermaphrodites under laboratory conditions. This may explain the ease with which nervous system mutants are isolated and handled in C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W2058986020,"A new nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit, β4 was identified by screening a rat genomic library. In situ hybridization histochemistry revealed expression of the β4 gene in the medial habenula of adult rat brains. The primary structure of this subunit was deduced from a cDNA clone isolated from a PC12 cDNA library. Functional nAChRs were detected in Xenopus oocytes injected in pairwise combinations with in vitro synthesized RNAs encoding β4 and either the α2, 0, or α4 subunit. Unlike the a3β2 receptor, the α3β4 receptor is not blocked by bungarotoxin 3.1, indicating that the β subunit can affect the sensitivity of neuronal nAChRs to this toxin. These results extend the functional diversity of nicotinic receptors in the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2018490550,"We have stably expressed in fibroblasts different pairs of alpha and non-alpha subunits of the mouse muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The gamma and delta, but not the beta, subunits associated efficiently with the alpha subunit, and they extensively modified its binding characteristics. The alpha gamma and alpha delta complexes formed distinctly different high affinity binding sites for the competitive antagonist d-tubocurarine that, together, completely accounted for the two nonequivalent antagonist binding sites in native AChR. The alpha delta complex and native AChR had similar affinities for the agonist carbamylcholine. In contrast, although the alpha gamma complex contains the higher affinity competitive antagonist binding site, it had an affinity for carbamylcholine that was an order of magnitude less than that of the alpha delta complex or the AChR. The comparatively low agonist affinity of the alpha gamma complex may represent an allosterically regulated binding site in the native AChR. These data support a model of two nonequivalent binding sites within the AChR and imply that the basis for this nonequivalence is the association of the alpha subunit with the gamma or delta subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1560182594,"Ricin, Shiga toxin, and Shiga-like toxin II (SLT-II, Vero toxin 2) exhibit an RNA N-glycosidase activity which specifically removes a single base near the 3′ end of 28 S rRNA in isolated rat liver ribosomes and deproteinized 28 S rRNA (Endo Y., Mitsui, K., Moti-zuki, M., & Tsurugi, K. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5908–5912; Endo Y. & Tsurugi, K. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 8128–8130, Endo, Y., Tsurugi, K., Yut-sudo, T., Takeda, Y., Ogasawara, K. & Igarashi, K. (1988) Eur. J. Biochem. 171, 45–50). These workers identified the single base removed, A-4324, by examining a 28 S rRNA degradation product which was generated by contaminating ribonucleases associated with the ribosomes. To determine whether this N-glycosidase activity applies in living cells, we microinjected ricin into Xenopus oocytes. We also microinjected Shiga toxin and a variant of Shiga-like toxin II (SLT-IIv). All three toxins specifically removed A-3732, located 378 nucleotides from the 3′ end of 28 S rRNA. This base is analogous to the site observed in rat 28 S rRNA for ricin, Shiga toxin, and SLT-II. Purified, glycosylated, ricin A chain contains this RNA N-glycosidase activity in oocytes. We also demonstrated that the nonglycosylated A subunit of recombinant ricin exhibits this RNA N-glycosidase activity when injected into Xenopus oocytes. Ricin, Shiga toxin, and SLT-IIv also caused a rapid decline in oocyte protein synthesis for nonsecretory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2016314596,"Lineage tracing techniques and pulse labeling experiments were used to reveal the lineages and the pattern of proliferation of neural precursors in the Xenopus neural plate. After gastrulation there is a wave of mitosis; most cells of the neural plate undergo a single division during this wave. After this first division, many cells leave the cell cycle and differentiate as primary neurons. In the stage hatching larvae, clones of primary neurons usually contain only two cells. The remainder, most of which arise from the superficial layer, are predominantly the precursors of secondary neurons. They are mitotically quiescent until stage 20, and then undergo another one to two rounds of division during embryonic life. Secondary precursors and primary neurons are never part of the same clone, although, in individual clones, primary neurons are frequently of different types. By the neural plate stage, separate precursors seem to exist for primary and secondary neurons, but the precursors of primary neurons themselves are pluripotent."
https://openalex.org/W2021497992,"Our objective was to investigate whether localized tissue injury induces expression of a gene encoding the major 70 kd heat shock protein (hsp70) in the mammalian nervous system. A small surgical cut was made in the rat cerebral cortex. By 2 hr postsurgery a dramatic and highly localized induction of hsp70 mRNA was detected at the lesion site using in situ hybridization with labeled riboprobe. By 12 hr the intensity of the signal had diminished, and by 24 hr only a few cells along the walls of the cut demonstrated a high level of hsp70 mRNA. Both neurons and glial cells at the site of the surgical cut responded to tissue injury by induction of hsp70 mRNA. Induction was not observed in other brain regions, nor was the pattern of constitutive expression affected by the surgical procedure."
https://openalex.org/W2009464647,"An FMRFamide-like neuropeptide, named AF1, was isolated from head extracts of the nematode Ascaris suum using five steps of HPLC. AF1 is a heptapeptide with the amino acid sequence Lys-Asn-Glu-Phe-Ile-Arg-Phe-NH2. Synthetic AF1 (10(-9) to 10(-7) M) rapidly and reversibly abolished slow membrane potential oscillations of identified ventral and dorsal inhibitory motoneurons and selectively reduced their input resistances. Synaptic transmission was not blocked. In intact Ascaris, AF1 inhibited locomotory movements. This study indicates a potential physiological role for an endogenous neuropeptide in nematodes."
https://openalex.org/W2011947862,"Long-term, but not short-term, facilitation induced by 5-HT in Aplysia sensory neurons is blocked by application of inhibitors of protein synthesis or RNA synthesis during the 1.5 hr training period. These findings suggest that genes and proteins not needed for the short-term process are required for long-term facilitation. To identify these proteins, we examined changes in overall and specific protein synthesis in sensory neurons. During the 1.5 hr period of stimulation, 5-HT initiated three temporally distinct changes in total protein synthesis: a small decrease at 0.5 hr, a small increase at 1 hr, and a second and larger increase at 3 hr. 5-HT also produced three temporally distinct changes in the synthesis of individual proteins that could be resolved on 2-D gels. First, there was an increase at 30 min in the rate of synthesis of 10 proteins and a decrease in the synthesis of 5 proteins. These changes in protein expression are rapid and transient, subsiding within 1–3 hr, and are transcription-dependent. Second, at 3 hr, there is a transient increase in 4 different proteins that also is transcription-dependent and lasts ∼5 hr. Finally, at 24 hr, during the retention phase of facilitation, there was a sustained increase in the expression of two proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1576025480,"A biochemical, molecular, and genetic analysis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae INO1 gene and its product, L-myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (EC 5.5.1.4) has been carried out. The sequence of the entire INO1 gene and surrounding regions has been determined. Computer analysis of the DNA sequence revealed four potential peptides. The largest open reading frame of 553 amino acids predicted a peptide with a molecular weight of 62,842. The amino acid composition and amino terminus of purified L-myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase were chemically determined and compared to the amino acid composition and amino terminus of the protein predicted from the DNA sequence of the large open reading frame. This analysis established that the large open reading frame encodes L-myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase. The largest of several small open reading frames adjacent to INO1 predicted a protein of 133 amino acids with a molecular weight of 15,182 and features which suggested that the encoded protein may be membrane-associated. A gene disruption was constructed at INO1 by eliminating a portion of the coding sequence and replacing it with another sequence. Strains carrying the gene disruption failed to express any protein cross-reactive to antibody directed against L-myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase. Although auxotrophic for inositol, strains carrying the gene disruption were completely viable when supplemented with inositol. In a similar fashion, a gene disruption was constructed in the chromosomal locus of the 133-amino acid open reading frame. This mutation did not affect viability but did cause inositol to be excreted from the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1917335220,"The methionine analog norleucine was produced during the synthesis of bovine somatotropin by Escherichia coli strain W3110G containing the recombinant plasmid pBGH1. Norleucine was generated by the leucine biosynthetic pathway from pyruvate or alpha-ketobutyrate in place of alpha-ketoisovalerate as the initial substrate. The intracellular level of norleucine was high enough to permit the analog to compete successfully with methionine for incorporation into protein. Two ways were found to prevent either the formation of norleucine or its incorporation into protein. The endogenous synthesis of norleucine was eliminated by deleting the leucine operon. The addition of sufficient methionine or 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutanoic acid, a precursor of methionine, to the culture medium prevented any norleucine from being incorporated into protein."
https://openalex.org/W1717856000,"Mercury (Hg) vapor is released from dental “silver” tooth fillings into human mouth air after chewing, but its possible uptake routes and distribution among body tissues are unknown. This investigation demonstrates that when radioactive 203Hg is mixed with dental Hg/silver fillings (amalgam) and placed in teeth of adult sheep, the isotope will appear in various organs and tissues within 29 days. Evidence of Hg uptake, as determined by whole-body scanning and measurement of isotope in specific tissues, revealed three uptake sites: lung, gastrointestinal, and jaw tissue absorption. Once absorbed, high concentrations of dental amalgam Hg rapidly localize in kidneys and liver. Results are discussed in view of potential health consequences from long-term exposure to Hg from this dental material.—Hahn, L. J.; Kloiber, R.; Vimy, M. J.; Takahashi, Y.; Lorscheider, F. L.

https://openalex.org/W1990335273,"In this study a K+ current, IKx, in isolated salamander rod photoreceptors was characterized and its role in shaping small photovoltages was examined. IKx is a standing outward current of about 40 pA at -30 mV that deactivates slowly when the cell is hyperpolarized (tau max = 0.25 s). The voltage and time dependence of IKx are similar to that of M-current, but IKx can be distinguished from M-current because it is not suppressed by acetylcholine and is ""blocked"" by external Ba2+ in a surprising manner: the activation range of IKx is shifted strongly in the positive direction. Using current-clamp recordings and a computer simulation of the photo-response, we show that IKx figures prominently in setting the dark resting potential and accelerates the voltage response to small photocurrents."
https://openalex.org/W2034685321,"To determine the influence that an appropriate target cell has on the axonal structure of a presynaptic neuron in vivo, we examined the morphologies of individual Aplysia sensory neurons in dissociated cell culture in the presence or absence of identified target motor neurons. We find that an appropriate target, the motor cell L7, regulates the morphological differentiation of the presynaptic sensory neurons in two ways: the target induces the axons of the sensory neurons to develop a more elaborate structure and to form active zones, and the target guides the outgrowth of the sensory neurons. The influence of the appropriate target, L7, on the morphological differentiation of sensory neurons appears to be related to the formation of chemical synaptic connections between the sensory neurons and L7, since sensory neurons co-cultured with an inappropriate target motor neuron do not exhibit a comparable elaboration of their axonal processes."
https://openalex.org/W2069757660,"To search for genes involved in determining the morphology of individual neuronal types, a cDNA library was constructed from postnatal day 13 mouse cerebellum. From this library, 2 clones, L7 and L19, were isolated by a differential hybridization procedure and shown by in situ hybridization to be Purkinje cell-specific within the cerebellum. Both RNAs appear between postnatal days 4 and 8 and continue into adulthood, coinciding with terminal differentiation of the Purkinje cells. L7 seems to be expressed exclusively in the cerebellum, whereas L19 is expressed throughout the brain. Consistent with the RNA localization, L7 protein is found only in the cerebellum and is confined to the Purkinje cells. The L7 amino acid sequence has been deduced from the cDNA sequence, and a pseudo-repeat within the L7 protein sequence is homologous to the amino acids sequence in the primary translation product of the gene for human sis/PDGF."
https://openalex.org/W1975551084,"GAP-43 (a.k.a. B-50, F1, pp46, or neuromodulin) is a major growth cone membrane protein whose expression is widely correlated with successful axon elongation, but whose function remains unknown. To distinguish the structural features of GAP-43 most relevant to its cellular functions, we have determined features of the protein that are most highly conserved in vertebrate evolution. Comparison of fish and mammalian GAP-43 distinguishes two domains of the protein. A strictly conserved amino-terminal domain contains the putative site for fatty acylation and membrane attachment, a calmodulin binding domain, and a proposed phosphorylation site. In the much larger carboxy-terminal domain, amino acid composition is strongly conserved without extensive sequence conservation. This amino acid composition predicts an extended, negatively charged rod conformation with some similarity to the side arms of neurofilaments. The results suggest that the biological roles of GAP-43 may depend on an ability to form a dynamic membrane-cytoskeleton-calmodulin complex."
https://openalex.org/W2043048773,"The weaver mutation (wv) causes a near total loss of midline granule cells in the mouse cerebellum. The cellular site of mutant locus action leading to the granuloprival phenotype was examined with experimental intraspecific and interspecific homozygous weaver chimeras. It was found that the granule cells which survived and successfully migrated to the internal granular layer of the chimeric cerebellum were all of the wild-type (non-wv) genotype. Using interspecies chimeras, it was determined that the genotype of Purkinje cells and Bergmann glia cells was apparently irrelevant to the survival of granule cells. It is concluded that granule cell death is most likely due to the wv locus acting intrinsically to the weaver granule cells, and not to another cellular site of gene action."
https://openalex.org/W1569409459,"The amino acid sequence of rat brain prostaglandin D synthetase (Urade, Y., Fujimoto, N., and Hayaishi, O. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 12410-12415) was determined by a combination of cDNA and protein sequencing. cDNA clones specific for this enzyme were isolated from a lambda gt11 rat brain cDNA expression library. Nucleotide sequence analyses of cloned cDNA inserts revealed that this enzyme consisted of a 564- or 549-base pair open reading frame coding for a 188- or 183-amino acid polypeptide with a Mr of 21,232 or 20,749 starting at the first or second ATG. About 60% of the deduced amino acid sequence was confirmed by partial amino acid sequencing of tryptic peptides of the purified enzyme. The recognition sequence for N-glycosylation was seen at two positions of amino acid residues 51-53 (-Asn-Ser-Ser-) and 78-80 (-Asn-Leu-Thr-) counted from the first Met. Both sites were considered to be glycosylated with carbohydrate chains of Mr 3,000, since two smaller proteins with Mr 23,000 and 20,000 were found during deglycosylation of the purified enzyme (Mr 26,000) with N-glycanase. The prostaglandin D synthetase activity was detected in fusion proteins obtained from lysogens with recombinants coding from 34 and 19 nucleotides upstream and 47 and 77 downstream from the first ATG, indicating that the glycosyl chain and about 20 amino acid residues of N terminus were not essential for the enzyme activity. The amino acid composition of the purified enzyme indicated that about 20 residues of hydrophobic amino acids of the N terminus are post-translationally deleted, probably as a signal peptide. These results, together with the immunocytochemical localization of this enzyme to rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum and other nuclear membrane of oligodendrocytes (Urade, Y., Fujimoto, N., Kaneko, T., Konishi, A., Mizuno, N., and Hayaishi, O. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 15132-15136) suggest that this enzyme is a membrane-associated protein."
https://openalex.org/W2031259962,"We have used biochemical and immunocytochemical techniques to investigate the possible involvement of membrane cytoskeletal elements such as α-actinin, calspectin (brain spectrin or fodrin), and actin in growth cone activities. During NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells, α-actinin increased in association with neurite outgrowth and was predominantly distributed throughout the entire growth cone and the distal portion of neurites. Filopodial movements were sensitive to Ca2+ flux. Two types of α-actinin, with Ca2+ sensitive and -insensitive actin binding abilities, were identified in the differentiated cells. Ca2+-sensitive α-actinin and actin filaments were concentrated in filopodia. The Ca2+-insensitive protein was distributed from the body of the growth cone to the distal portion of neurites, corresponding to the substratum-adhesive sites. The location of calspectin in growth cones was similar to that of the Ca2+-insensitive α-actinin. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that Ca2+ sensitive α-actinin and actin filaments are involved in Ca2+-dependent filopodial movement and Ca2+-insensitive α-actinin and calspectin are associated with adhesion of growth cones."
https://openalex.org/W1566307023,"Abstract Synthetic peptides (32 residues in length) were synthesized with amino acid sequences identical to, or related to, the long (alanine + proline)-rich region of polypeptide chain that links the innermost lipoyl domain to the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase-binding domain in the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex of Escherichia coli. The 400-MHz 1H NMR spectra of the peptide (Mr approximately 2800) closely resembled the sharp resonances in the spectrum of the intact complex (Mr approximately 5 x 10(6], and the apparent pKa (6.4) of the side chain of a histidine residue in one of the peptides was found to be identical to that previously observed for a histidine residue inserted by site-directed mutagenesis into the corresponding position in the same (alanine + proline)-rich region of a genetically reconstructed enzyme complex. These results strongly support the view that the three long (alanine + proline)-rich regions of the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase chains are exposed to solvent and enjoy substantial conformational flexibility in the enzyme complex. More detailed analysis of the peptides by circular dichroism and by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy revealed that they were disordered in structure but were not random coils. In particular, all the Ala-Pro peptide bonds were greater than 95% in the trans configuration, consistent with a stiffening of the peptide structure. Differences in the sequences of the three long (alanine + proline)-rich segments may reflect structural tuning of these segments to optimize lipoyl domain movement in enzyme catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2003952837,"The ability of a neuronal surface glycoprotein to mediate the formation of neuronal connections was tested in an explant culture system. A monoclonal antibody against the limbic system-associated membrane protein (LAMP) was used in co-cultures containing cholinergic neurons of the septum and their hippocampal target neurons. Antibody treatment had no effect on general axon outgrowth, but significantly diminished the ability of septal cholinergic axons to invade and collateralize in the hippocampus. The results suggest that factors regulating general axon outgrowth may be distinct from those regulating the patterns of outgrowth that define the formation of neural circuits."
https://openalex.org/W1964618518,"In Aplysia mechanosensory neurons, the neuropeptide FMRFamide increases the opening of the background S-K+ channel. This action is mediated by activation of arachidonic acid metabolism. Arachidonic acid in Aplysia nervous tissue is transformed through the 12-lipoxygenase pathway to 12-HPETE, which undergoes further metabolism. In intact sensory cells, 12-HPETE simulates the FMRFamide response, raising the question of whether 12-HPETE is the messenger molecule ultimately acting on the S-K+ channel. Here we show that in cell-free (inside-out) patches from sensory cells, 12-HPETE fails to modulate the S-K+ channel, but in the presence of hematin (which catalyzes 12-HPETE metabolism), it triggers sharp increases in the channel opening probability. We also found that SKF-525A, an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450, reduces the response to FMRFamide, arachidonic acid, and 12-HPETE in intact cells. We conclude that a heme-catalyzed transformation of 12-HPETE is necessary and sufficient to promote the opening of the S-K+ channel and a heme-containing enzyme such as cytochrome P450 might play this key role."
https://openalex.org/W1999454445,"Toxins from spider venom, originally purified for their ability to block synaptic transmission in Drosophila, are potent and specific blockers of Ca2+ currents measured in cultured embryonic Drosophila neurons using the whole-cell, patch-clamp technique. Differential actions of toxins from two species of spiders indicate that different types of Drosophila neuronal Ca2+ currents can be pharmacologically distinguished. Hololena toxin preferentially blocks a non-inactivating component of the current, whereas Plectreurys toxin blocks both inactivating and non-inactivating components. These results suggest that block of a non-inactivating Ca2+ current is sufficient to block neurotransmitter release at Drosophila neuromuscular junction."
https://openalex.org/W1993998305,"The fate of nerve terminals following elimination of postsynaptic target cells was studied in living mouse muscle. Several days after muscle fiber damage, observations of previously identified neuromuscular junctions showed that motor nerve terminal branches had rapidly disappeared from degenerating muscle fibers. Following muscle fiber regeneration, loss of terminal branches ceased and nerve terminals regrew, reestablishing some of the original sites and adding new branches. The distribution of acetylcholine receptors reorganized in the regenerated muscle so that perfect alignment was reestablished with the newly configured nerve terminals. These results argue that the maintenance of the full complement of nerve terminal branches at a neuromuscular junction is dependent on the presence of a healthy muscle fiber. Similarly, regenerating muscle is dependent on the nerve terminal for the organization and maintenance of postsynaptic receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2019163178,"Measurement of acetylcholine (ACh)-induced currents indicates that the sensitivity of embryonic sympathetic neurons increases following innervation in vivo and in vitro. We have used single-channel recording to assess the contribution of changes in ACh receptor properties to this increase. Early in development (before synaptogenesis), we detect three classes of ACh-activated channels that differ in their conductance and kinetics. Molecular studies indicating a variety of neuronal receptor subunit clones suggest a similar diversity. Later in development (after innervation), changes in functional properties include increases in conductance and apparent mean open time, the addition of a new conductance class, as well as apparent clustering and segregation of channel types. These changes in channel function are compatible with the developmental increase in ACh sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1675708121,"Abstract A fragment comprising the DNA-binding domain of the human glucocorticoid receptor has been expressed in a functional form in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with protein A from Staphylococcus aureus. The DNA-binding domain was purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity chromatography on IgG-Sepharose and DNA-cellulose, a purification scheme which does not involve denaturation of the protein at any step. The DNA-binding domain was separated from the protein A part of the fusion protein by domain-specific enzymatic cleavage with chymotrypsin while immobilized on IgG-Sepharose. The recombinant protein has been characterized by amino acid analysis, NH2- and COOH-terminal sequence analysis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and reactivity to iodoacetate and was found to correspond to the primary structure derived from the cDNA sequence. DNase I footprinting showed that the purified recombinant protein bound to the same DNA sequences on the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat as glucocorticoid receptor purified from rat liver does. About 10 times more recombinant protein, on a molar basis, was needed to obtain the same level of protection. However, the protection of the three different footprints (1.3, 1.4, and 1.5') by the recombinant protein differed greatly from that of the natural receptor, with virtually no protection of footprint 1.4. This indicates cooperative binding of the natural receptor to adjacent footprints, dependent on other regions of the receptor than the DNA-binding domain."

The phase-modulated rotating frame imaging technique, incorporating magnetization transfer and inversion recovery, has been used to produce a 1-dimensional rate profile map of steady-state enzyme activity. Large differences in the flux from phosphocreatine (PCr) to ATP have been discovered between volumes of human brain consisting of predominantly gray (2.0 cm) and white (4.5 cm) matter. The concentration of PCr changes slightly (2.0 cm = 5.20 ± 0.45 mmol ·1−1, 4.5 cm = 4.63 ± 0.31 mmol·1−1), while the ATP concentration remains within limits (3.30 ± 0.4 mmol · 1−1). No change in pHi was detected between the two regions in normal volunteers (n = 6).

https://openalex.org/W1498454438,"Treatment of the dihydrolipoyl transacetylase-protein X-kinase subcomplex (E2-X-KcKb) with protease Arg C selectively converted protein X into an inner domain fragment (Mr ≌ 35,000) and an outer (lipoylbearing) domain fragment (Mr ≌ 15,500). These fragments were larger and much smaller, respectively, than the inner domain and outer domain fragments derived from the E2 component, supporting the conclusion that protein X is distinct from the E2 component. Protease Arg C cleaved the Kb subunit more slowly than protein X. An increase in kinase activity correlated with this cleavage of the Kb subunits. An even slower cleavage of E2 subunits generated an inner domain fragment (Mr ≌ 31,500) and a lipoyl-bearing domain fragment (Mr ≌ 49,000) which had Mr values at least 3,000 and 10,000 larger, respectively, than the corresponding E2 fragments generated by trypsin treatment of the subcomplex. Following various extents of cleavage with protease Arg C or trypsin, residual oligomeric subcomplexes were isolated and characterized. We found that selective removal of the lipoyl-bearing domain of protein X did not alter lipoyl-mediated regulation of the kinase indicating that the lipoyl residues bound to E2 subunits are effective, that the inner domain of protein X remained associated with the inner domain of E2 subunits following the complete removal of the outer domains of both E2 and protein X, that, with only 10% of the E2 subunits intact, nearly half of the catalytic (Kc) subunits of the kinase were bound by the residual subcomplex, and that removal of the remaining outer domains from E2 subunits released the Kc subunits. Thus, protein X is unique among the subunits of the complex in binding tightly to the oligomeric inner domain of the transacetylase, and the outer domain of the transacetylase serves to bind to and facilitate the regulation of the catalytic subunit of the kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2008665846,"Leech sensory afferents change their growth behavior as they enter the CNS. Arriving from the periphery in fasciculated tracts, they abruptly defasciculate and expand into diffuse trees before reassembling into four distinct central tracts. In the organ-cultured germinal plate, growing sensory afferents were incubated with monovalent Fab fragments of the Lan3-2 antibody, which recognizes a 130 kd sensory neuron protein by its mannose epitope. Very low concentrations of Lan3-2 (6 and 12 nM) specifically inhibited the central defasciculation of sensory afferents, which then continued growing as a single tract. In contrast, monoclonal antibody Lan3–6, which binds to an internal sensory antigen, failed to yield the same effect. These observations suggest that this sensory neuron 130 kd surface glycoprotein participates in a developmentally significant heterophilic interaction specific for the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2069134576,"A compartmented culture system in which distal neurites from newborn rat sympathetic neurons entered a fluid environment separate from that bathing the cell bodies and proximal neurites was used to investigate effects of extracellular Ca2+ deprivation on nerve fiber growth. Neurites readily grew into, elongated for many days within, and regenerated after neuritotomy within distal compartments substantially deprived of Ca2+ (0 added Ca2+, 0.5-5 mM EGTA), provided Ca2+ was supplied to the cell bodies. The Ca2(+)-deprived neurites generally extended at rates 20%-35% slower than controls. Growth of neurites did, however, cease within 2 days when the cell bodies were deprived of Ca2+, and the neurites and cell bodies eventually degenerated. These results show that neither extracellular Ca2+ nor the influx of Ca2+ at or near the growth cone is required for sustained neurite growth. They also rule out the possibility that the promotion of neurite growth by nerve growth factor is mediated, by the influx of extracellular Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1520029968,"Protease nexin-1 is a protein proteinase inhibitor that is secreted by a variety of cultured cells and rapidly forms complexes with thrombin, urokinase, and plasmin; the complexes then bind back to the cells and are internalized and degraded. In fibroblast cultures, protease nexin-1 is localized to the extracellular matrix. Here we report that protease nexin-1, which is bound to the surface of fibroblasts, forms complexes with thrombin, but not urokinase or plasmin. Experiments were conducted to determine directly if protease nexin-1 binding to the fibroblast surface alters its proteinase specificity. To do this, cell surface protease nexin-1 was inhibited using anti-protease nexin-1 monoclonal antibodies that stoichiometrically block its ability to form complexes with target proteinases. Then, purified protease nexin-1 was added to these cells; the cell-bound molecule formed complexes with thrombin, but not urokinase or plasmin. Similar experiments showed that protease nexin-1 bound to preparations of fibroblast extracellular matrix also formed complexes with thrombin, but not urokinase or plasmin. Components of the extracellular matrix other than heparin-like glycosaminoglycans are required for this regulation since heparin did not block the formation of complexes between protease nexin-1 and urokinase or plasmin. These results suggest that protease nexin-1 is primarily a thrombin inhibitor in interstitial fluids where much of it would be bound to cell surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1536684588,"We have investigated the formation of D-aspartyl and L-isoaspartyl (beta-aspartyl) residues and their subsequent methylation in bovine brain calmodulin by the type II protein carboxyl methyltransferase. Based on the results of studies with unstructured peptides and denatured proteins, it has been proposed that the major sites of carboxyl methylation in calmodulin are at L-isoaspartyl residues that originate from two Asn-Gly sequences. To test this hypothesis, we directly identified the sites of methylation in affinity-purified preparations of calmodulin by peptide mapping using the proteases trypsin, endoproteinase Lys-C, clostripain, chymotrypsin, and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. We found, however, that the major high-affinity sites of methylation originate from aspartyl residues at position 2 and at positions 78 and/or 80. The methylatable residue in the first case was shown to be L-isoaspartate by comparison of the properties of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 13 residues substituted with an L-iso-Asp residue at position 2. The second methylatable residue, probably derived from Asp78, also appears to be an L-isoaspartyl residue. These sites appear to be readily accessible to the methyltransferase and are present in relatively flexible regions of calmodulin that may allow the spontaneous degradation reactions to occur that generate L-isoaspartyl residues via succinimide intermediates. Interestingly, the four calcium binding regions, each containing 3-4 aspartyl and asparaginyl residues (including the two Asn-Gly sequences), do not appear to contribute to the high-affinity methyl acceptor sites, even when calcium is removed prior to the methylation reaction. We propose that methylatable residues do not form at these sites because of the inflexibility of these regions when calcium is bound."
https://openalex.org/W1582239215,"Four synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides of the sequence 5'-CCG1TG2G3G4ATATGGGCTG-3' were constructed with a 1',2'-[3H]deoxyguanosine located at one of the four sites indicated (1, 2, 3, or 4). This sequence was derived from a region of the Escherichia coli xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene where position 4 is a site frequently mutated by N-methyl-N'-nitrosourea as compared to sites 1-3. These four oligomers were alkylated in both single- and double-stranded form with N-methyl-N'-nitrosourea, and the relative amount of O6-methyldeoxyguanosine (O6-MedGuo) formed at each position was quantitated. Up to a 5-6-fold greater formation of O6-MedGuo was observed at positions 3 and 4 as compared to positions 1 and 2. This uneven distribution was only observed in oligomers in the double-stranded form, suggesting that secondary structure was an important determinant in generating the uneven distribution of O6-MedGuo. Comparisons between the extent of O6-MedGuo formation and mutation frequency at the four positions suggest that a difference in the formation of promutagenic adducts at specific sites is just one of the factors involved in the generation of mutagenic hotspots. The novel method developed was applied to the study of formation of O6-MedGuo at specific sites; however, it should be suitable for studying the formation and repair of DNA adducts generated by a variety of chemicals in a wide variety of DNA sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1484354452,"Abstract Prostacyclin (PGI2) receptors have been identified on platelets and other tissues but their physicochemical properties remain unknown due to difficulties in obtaining active solubilized receptors. We evaluated the ability of several detergents to release the receptors from platelet membrane preparations. In contrast to the results of Dutta-Roy and Sinha (Dutta-Roy, A. K., and Sinha, A. K. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 12685-12691) which revealed selective solubilization of PGE1/PGI2 receptors by 0.05% Triton X-100, we found that CHAPS (3-[(3-chlamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid) (10 mM) was far superior in releasing the PGI2 receptors. In fact, Triton X-100 failed to release detectable PGI2 binding activity into the supernatant. The CHAPS-solubilized receptor degraded rapidly unless 30% glycerol was added which greatly enhanced its stability. By employing an improved binding assay using [3H]iloprost as the ligand and selective membrane filters (AP-15 or GF/B) pretreated with polyethyleneimine for achieving a higher trapping efficiency, we showed by equilibrium binding measurements that the solubilized receptors exhibited a single class of binding sites with a KD of 18.5 nM and Bmax 0.5 pmol/mg. These values were similar to those of the membrane receptors, i.e. KD of 16.6 nM and Bmax 1.0 pmol/mg. Kinetic binding measurements of the solubilized receptors revealed an association rate constant of 0.51 x 10(6) M-1 s-1 and dissociation rate constant of 0.0041 s-1 yielding a calculated KD of 8.0 nM. Displacement of [3H]iloprost (Ki values) from the solubilized and the membrane receptors by diversified eicosanoids was parallel. Our data demonstrate for the first time a successful solubilization of platelet PGI2 receptors. The solubilized receptors retained almost identical binding characteristics as the native membrane receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2040388036,"The central nervous system of murine intraspecies chimeras generally consists of an apparently random mixture of neurons derived from each of the parental genotypes. In this study, interspecies mouse chimeras were examined, and an analysis of the parental genotype donation to the chimeric CNS revealed large clusters of like-genotype neurons in small regions as well as in major subdivisions of the CNS. This coherent clustering of like-genotype neurons is proposed to be due to an autonomous developmental clock that is sufficiently mismatched between species to create preferential cell allotment in the chimeric brain."
https://openalex.org/W1575820936,"Abstract We have evaluated, by use of isolated canine hepatocytes, the importance of intramolecular hormone cross-linking (and of concomitant changes in molecular flexibility) to the interaction of insulin with its plasma membrane receptor. Cross-linked hormone analogs were prepared by reacting porcine insulin, N alpha A1-t-butyloxycarbonyl insulin or N alpha A1-t-butyloxycarbonyl [D-LysA1]insulin with various dicarboxylic acid active esters to obtain alpha-GlyA1/epsilon-LysB29-, alpha-PheB1/epsilon-LysB29-, and epsilon-D-LysA1/epsilon-LysB29-cross-linked insulins, respectively. In the aggregate, insulin analogs cross-linked by groups containing 2-12 atoms retained 1.4-35% of the receptor binding potency of native insulin. Analysis of our results suggests that: (a) loss of chemical functionality, steric interference, and restriction of potential intramolecular movement can all play roles in determining the receptor binding potencies of cross-linked insulin analogs; (b) restriction of intramolecular movement between residues A1 and B29 affects negatively the binding of insulin to its receptor (but accounts for only a fraction of the conformational change which insulin must undergo to achieve a high affinity state of ligand-receptor interaction); and (c) introduction of a cross-link between residues B1 and B29 (residues that are in fact in proximity in one crystalline form of the hormone) decreases markedly the receptor binding potencies of the corresponding analogs. The importance of these findings is discussed in relation to the potential structure of insulin when it is bound to its plasma membrane receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2029642748,"The contribution of the basal lamina to Ti1 pioneer axon guidance in grasshopper limb buds was investigated by allowing growth cones to migrate in 30%-31% stage limbs from which the basal lamina had been removed by enzymatic treatment. When the Ti1 axons extended from their normal location, the pathways established in the absence of basal lamina were normal. This indicates that the basal lamina is not required for initial proximal axon outgrowth, recognition of limb segment boundaries, or selective interaction with neuronal somata. Removal of the basal lamina from slightly older (32% stage) embryos resulted in displacement of the Ti1 somata to ectopic locations in approximately 50% of the limbs. Pathfinding from ectopic locations was aberrant in 45% of the cases observed. This demonstrates that if orienting information is present in the basal lamina-free epithelium at this stage, it is not the predominant factor in determining growth cone orientation from ectopic locations."
https://openalex.org/W1555737394,"Abstract It is unclear how transit peptides target nuclear-encoded precursor proteins to the chloroplast. This study establishes the feasibility of using synthetic peptides as competitive inhibitors of chloroplast protein import and as probes for the function of domains within transit peptides. We show that peptide pL(1-20), MAASTMALSSPAFAGKAVNY, an analog of the NH2 terminus of a pre-light harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein II from Arabidopsis, inhibits the import of several Arabidopsis and pea precursor proteins into pea chloroplasts. Inhibition occurs at a step between the initial binding of precursors to the chloroplast and the first proteolytic cleavage event and is not due to interference with ATP availability or chloroplast integrity. Presumably this reflects specific binding of the peptide to the import machinery in the chloroplast envelope. Our data are consistent with the suggestion (Karlin-Neumann, G. A., and Tobin, E. M. (1986) EMBO J. 5, 9-13) that two conserved blocks of amino acids near the NH2-terminus of transit peptides (spanned by peptide pL(1-20] participate in protein targeting. Computer analysis also shows peptide pL(1-20) lacks the amphiphilic properties characteristic of pre-sequences of many nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. This shows a difference in the mechanisms for targeting proteins to chloroplasts and mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2092676628,"Adrenal medullary chromaffin cells have the capacity to transdifferentiate into sympathetic neurons. We show here that SCG10, a neural-specific gene that is induced during this transdifferentiation, is maintained in mature chromaffin cells in a potentially active chromatin conformation marked by two DNAase I hypersensitive sites (HSS). A low level of transcription is associated with this conformation. The HSS are also present in neurons expressing high levels of SCG10, but not in nonneuronal cells. Experiments using transgenic mice suggest that these HSS can in principle form in any cell type expressing the gene, but that a cis-repression mechanism normally prevents their assembly in nonneuronal cells. We suggest that the SCG10 HSS may represent a molecular marker of the lineage and phenotypic plasticity of chromaffin cells."
https://openalex.org/W1491214821,"Abstract Previous studies in this laboratory have demonstrated that a 174-base pair (bp) rat rDNA spacer region located more than 2 kilobase pairs upstream of the initiation site, can enhance rat rDNA transcription in vitro independent of its orientation or distance or when inserted downstream of the initiation site. Further dissection of this region showed that transcription of a rDNA fragment containing just 37 bp of the spacer sequence, located between -2.183 and -2.219 kilobase pairs upstream of the initiation site, is 8-fold greater than that of the rDNA fragment devoid of the spacer element. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated specific interaction of the 37-bp DNA fragment with a cellular protein(s). The spacer DNA competed for essential transcription factors as demonstrated by the absence of transcription following preincubation of the extract with the 37-bp fragment. Similar competition was also observed when a 58-bp PolI promoter was substituted for the enhancer fragment. The binding of the factor(s) to the enhancer element was not altered when coding and noncoding strands of the 37-bp oligodeoxynucleotide were used separately in the competition assay. Since the 37-bp enhancer region and the core promoter do not exhibit any significant sequence homology, the factor(s) appears to interact with these cis-acting elements in a sequence-independent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1500375651,"Abstract The rat mast cell protease gene, RMCP II, is specifically expressed in the mucosal subclass of rat mast cells. We show here that the 5'-flanking region of this gene contains a mast cell-specific enhancer that directs preferential expression of a linked reporter gene (human growth hormone) transfected into rat basophilic leukemia cells. A DNA fragment containing the enhancer sequence is capable of binding specifically to mast cell nuclear trans-acting factors. The sequence of this enhancer element contains a region of homology to a consensus core sequence present in the enhancer region of the pancreatic protease genes."
https://openalex.org/W1585590566,"Abstract The influence of nucleotides and pyrophosphate on phospholipase C from rabbit thymocytes was investigated by using two different methods for the determination of phospholipase C activity. In a first approach the release of radiolabeled inositol phosphates from [3H]inositol-labeled membranes was examined. By a second type of experiment the cleavage of exogenously added radiolabeled phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2) was measured. Using internally labeled membranes only guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) exhibited a stimulatory effect on the phospholipase C suggesting the involvement of a G-protein. When exogenous [3H]PtdIns-4,5-P2 was used as substrate, cleavage of PtdIns-4,5-P2 was stimulated by all nucleotides investigated; in addition pyrophosphate showed a stimulatory effect. From these data we conclude that the increased cleavage of exogenous PtdIns-4,5-P2 induced by GTP analogues is not conclusive in terms of the involvement of a G-protein. Rather than induced by a G-protein this activation may be caused by an increased substrate accessibility. Our experiments with endogenous substrate clearly established the regulatory role of G-proteins for membrane-bound phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W1596819796,"Lactose permease of Escherichia coli was reconstituted into vesicles of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and the rate of galactoside counterflow was measured in the millisecond time range. The turnover number and the half-saturation constant for transport agree with the values known for cells. This result demonstrates that lactose permease is the sole protein necessary for galactoside transport. Furthermore, lactose permease seems not to require a high level of negatively charged lipids or a certain degree of unsaturation of the lipid hydrocarbon chains. However, the lipids must be in the fluid state, because the transport rate drastically decreases below the lipid ordered fluid phase transition."
https://openalex.org/W1532772595,"Abstract Hepatocyte stimulating factor (HSF, a polypeptide cytokine) is a major regulatory hormone responsible for hepatic acute-phase reactant (APR) induction following acute systemic injury. The mechanisms by which HSF regulates APR synthesis in the liver are unknown. Microtubules are involved in a number of polypeptide hormone-mediated events which can be modified, either positively or negatively, by microtubule depolymerizing agents. In this study we have used colchicine (a microtubule depolymerizing drug) to assess whether or not HSF-mediated changes in rat hepatic alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) or albumin mRNA levels require an intact microtubule cytoskeletal system. Cultured rat hepatocytes were pretreated for 30 min with either colchicine (10(-6) M), or the inactive isomer lumicolchicine (10(-6) M), or fresh medium. Following pretreatment, purified murine macrophage HSF (10 units/ml) was added and the cells were incubated for an additional 12 h. Colchicine, but not lumicolchicine, significantly inhibited the HSF-dependent regulation of mRNA for the positive APR, AGP, but had no effect on the mRNA levels of albumin, a negative APR. Furthermore, removal of colchicine from previously inhibited cultures allowed HSF to restimulate AGP mRNA expression. These data suggest that microtubules may play a regulatory role in controlling the expression of the genes for positive acute-phase proteins and may explain the temporal differences found in vivo between positive and negative APR expression."
https://openalex.org/W2140464683,"The time course of synaptic currents is significantly longer in slow than in fast twitch muscle fibers. To examine the underlying basis for these slow synaptic currents, single-channel recordings were made from the synapses of slow muscle fibers. Our analysis indicates that low conductance acetylcholine receptor (AChR) channels predominate in innervated slow fibers. The high level of expression of low conductance channels is in contrast to fast twitch fibers, in which these channels are expressed in significant numbers only in embryonic or denervated muscle. Analysis of the distribution of open durations for the low conductance channel class suggests that the open time of this AChR class is the major determinant in shaping the slow time course of synaptic current decay. The predominant contribution of low conductance channel openings to synaptic currents of slow muscle fibers indicates a well-defined physiological role for this class of AChRs."
https://openalex.org/W1491616008,"The ilvY gene of Escherichia coli is transcribed in a direction opposite to the ilvGMEDA operon, and the translational stop codons of the ilvA and ilvY genes are only 52 base pairs (bp) apart. We have employed galK transcriptional analyses, in vitro transcription assays, and S1 nuclease mapping to show that the converging transcripts of the ilvGMEDA operon and the ilvY gene overlap. The ilvGMEDA transcript terminates at two sites in the distal amino acid coding region of the ilvY gene: a rho-independent termination site 116 bp downstream of the ilvA translational stop codon, ilvA t, and a 62-bp-long rho-dependent termination site, ilvA t', beginning 70 bp beyond the ilvA t site. This tt' termination pattern at the distal end of the ilvGMEDA operon is similar to that of the trp operon of E. coli and the leu operon of Salmonella typhimurium. Termination of ilvY transcription occurs over a broad stretch of DNA several hundred base pairs downstream of the ilvY translational stop codon in the middle of the amino acid coding region of the ilvA gene. These experiments demonstrate that the converging transcripts from the ilvA and ilvY genes terminate in the coding region of the opposing gene."
https://openalex.org/W1510235494,"Psoralen cross-linking was used to produce intramolecular cross-links in the Escherichia coli 16 S ribosomal RNA in the inactive and active forms of the 30 S subunit. A number of psoralen cross-links were made in the inactive form that were not made in the active form. The most frequent of these cross-links was sequenced by a series of techniques and identified as C-924 to U-1532. In this region, a three-base complementary, (921–923)•(1532–1534), forms a site where psoralen can stack and produce a cross-link between C-924 and U-1532. When psoralen monoadducts were placed on inactive subunits and the conformation was switched to the active form before cross-linking, a new cross-link involving U-1393 was detected. U-1393 is part of the complementarity, (923–925)•(1391–1393), that has previously been proposed as being an element of the functional secondary structure on the basis of sequence comparison. The complementarity between (921–923•(1532–1534) occurs in most nonmitochondrial small subunit RNAs; however, there are several counter examples in which it does not occur. This suggests that this alternate secondary structure interaction is not necessary for the function of the 30 S subunit."

https://openalex.org/W1603594368,"Abstract Incorporation of Glc and Fru into glycogen was measured in perfused livers from 24-h fasted rats using [6-3H]Glc and [U-14C]Fru. For the initial 20 min, livers were perfused with low Glc (2 mM) to deplete hepatic glycogen and were perfused for the following 30 min with various combinations of Glc and Fru. With constant Fru (2 mM), increasing perfusate Glc increased the relative contribution of Glc carbons to glycogen (7.2 +/- 0.4, 34.9 +/- 2.8, and 59.1 +/- 2.7% at 2, 10, and 20 mM Glc, respectively; n = 5 for each). During perfusion with substrate levels seen during refeeding (10 mM Glc, 1.8 mumol/g/min gluconeogenic flux from 2 mM Fru), Fru provided 54.7 +/- 2.7% of the carbons for glycogen, while Glc provided only 34.9 +/- 2.8%, consistent with in vivo estimations. However, the estimated rate of Glc phosphorylation was at least 1.10 +/- 0.11 mumol/g/min, which exceeded by at least 4-fold the glycogen accumulation rate (0.28 +/- 0.04 mumol of glucose/g/min). The total rate of glucose 6-phosphate supply via Glc phosphorylation and gluconeogenesis (2.9 mumol/g/min) exceeded reported in vivo rates of glycogen accumulation during refeeding. Thus, in perfused livers of 24-h fasted rats there is an apparent redundancy in glucose 6-phosphate supply. These results suggest that the rate-limiting step for hepatic glycogen accumulation during refeeding is located between glucose 6-phosphate and glycogen, rather than at the step of Glc phosphorylation or in the gluconeogenic pathway."
