https://openalex.org/W2164269528,"Rabbit liver DNA was cleaved with the restriction endonucleases Eco RI, Pst I or Kpn I. Resulting DNA fragments were denatured, separated by electrophoresis in agarose gels and subsequently transferred by blotting onto nitrocellulose filters. Filters were then hybridized with a plasmid containing a DNA copy of rabbit beta-globin messenger RNA (plasmid PbetaG1; Maniatis et al., 1976) which had been labeled by nick translation to a high specific activity with 32P. A very limited number of discrete rabbit DNA fragments was found which could form well matched hybrids with PbetaG1 DNA. Endonuclease Eco RI, which cleaves the rabbit beta-globin gene, produced two beta-globin DNA fragments, whereas endonucleases Pst I and Kpn I, which do not cut the gene, each generated only one fragment. Using double digests, these fragments could be ordered into a physical map of restriction endonuclease cleavage sites around the beta-globin gene on the rabbit genome. This map is consistent with the presence of a single copy of the beta-globin gene per haploid genome. The direction of transcription of the beta-globin gene within the physical map was determined."

Investigations showed that he had circadian rhythms of body temperature, alertness, performance, cortisol secretion, and urinary electrolyte excretion which were desynchronized from the 24-hour societal schedule. These rhythms all had periods which were longer than 24 hours and indistinguishable from the period of the lunar day."

Strains induced fluid accumulation in rabbit ileal loops and positive activity in Y-1 adrenal cells. Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and related vibrios show a spatial and temporal distribution characteristic of Vibrio species in an estuary. The Vibrio cholerae strains isolated from Chesapeake Bay represent serotypes other than O-group I--that is, so-called nonagglutinable vibrios--and are not recognized as a serious epidemic threat, although they have caused cholera-like diarrhea sporadically."
https://openalex.org/W2047222380,"The release of [3H]dopamine in vivo was estimated in the left and right caudate nuclei of the cat during the continuous superfusion of the two structures with L-[3,5-3H]tyrosine by means of two ""push-pull"" cannulas. A lesion made in the left substantia nigra interrupted the release of [3H]dopamine in the ipsilateral caudate nucleus and was associated with a simultaneous increase in the release of [3H]dopamine on the contralateral side. The release of [3H]dopamine also decreased in the left caudate nucleus and increased in the right structure when dopamine was applied to the left substantia nigra which reduces the activity of the left dopaminergic pathway. A total of 120 estimations of the spontaneous release of [3H]dopamine were made simultaneously in the left and right caudate nuclei during periods characterized by a stable physiological state of the animals, and 76% of the estimations showed that an increase in the release of [3H]dopamine on one side corresponded to a decrease in the release of [3H]dopamine on the other side, and vice versa. These results demonstrate a close relation between the two nigrostriatal dopaminergic systems."

https://openalex.org/W2082794671,"The perceived duration of a photopically illuminated, fixated grating presented for 50 milliseconds increased (from 300 to 500 milliseconds) with spatial frequency (0.9 to 15 cycles per degree). This suggests a sustained neural channel contribution to short-term visual storage, and argues against a pure photoreceptor, especially a rod, locus for such storage."
https://openalex.org/W1963599622,"Carcinogenic risk assessment involves a mixture of statistical, scientific, and public policy considerations. Concepts in current use, such as ""no observed effect levels"" and ""virtual safety,"" and the problems in implementing them by means of dose-response models, particularly the probit-log dose and linear models are reviewed. The upper limits to risk provided by some conservative procedures are inconsistent with coherent balancing of risks and benefits. A common basis to the dose-response curves describing both carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic effects is to be found in deactivating reactions. A simplified model in which a toxic substance is activated and deactivated in separate and simultaneous reactions is presented and the dose response curve implied by the model is deduced. This curve has the general form of a hockey stick, with the striking part flat or nearly flat until the dose administered saturates the deactivation system, after which the probability of a response rises rapidly. Such a curve describes the Bryan-Shimkin methylcholanthrene-tumor incidence dose response curve as well as the probit log-dose model. The concept of a saturation dose is relevant to risk assessments for carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic substances alike."
https://openalex.org/W1968228992,"The commitment theory may explain both the finite lifespan of diploid fibroblasts and the apparent immortality of transformed lines. Potentially immortal cells are assumed on division to generate with some fixed probability cells committed to senesce after a specific number of divisions. During the period between commitment and senescence, cells are assumed to maintain normal growth so that the uncommitted cells are diluted by committed ones and may ultimately be lost in subculturing. A number of predictions of this model are described and experiments strongly supporting the theory are reported. We conclude that the limited growth of diploid fibroblasts is, in effect, an artifact of normal culturing procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2038709703,Transitional cell carcinoma was induced in the bladders of male Fischer rats by 12 oral doses of the carcinogen N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine. Feeding of 13-cis-retinoic acid after completion of carcinogen treatment diminished the number and severity of cancers and other proliferative lesions of the bladder.
https://openalex.org/W2087288687,"About one-half of on-off ganglion cells have inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSP's) which are blocked by strychnine, while the remainder have IPSP's which are blocked by picrotoxin or bicuculline. These antagonists do not abolish light activity of the presynaptic inhibitory neuron, the amacrine cell. The existence of separate gamma-aminobutyric acid- and glycine-releasing amacrine cells is implied by these results."
https://openalex.org/W2007226200,"Synthesis of the two filament proteins (flagellin A and flagellin B) of the Caulobacter creascentus flagellum was measured during the cell cycle. Synchronous cells were pulse-labeled with 36S-methionine, and flagellin proteins were isolated from crude extracts by radioimmune precipitation. The results showed that both proteins are maximally induced during the G2 period and that their induction requires de novo transcription. Flagellin A, however, continues to be made in the progeny swarmer cells after flagellin B synthesis has stopped. This discoordination in flagellin A and B synthesis and the relative abundance of the two proteins may result in part from the longer functional half-life of the flagellin A messenger RNA. Analysis of temperature-sensitive DNA chain elongation mutants suggests that the periodicity of flagellin A and B synthesis in the cell cycle is controlled by a late cell cycle event, presumably the completion of chromosome replication."
https://openalex.org/W1578458937,"Glucagon binding by liver cell membranes was examined in rats with chronically elevated plasma levels of immunoreactive glucagon (IRG) resulting from insulin deficiency, starvation, or twice daily glucagon injections. The concentration of specific glucagon binding sites was significantly reduced in the three chronically hyperglucagonemic (IRG greater than 125 pg/ml) groups as compared with nondiabetic controls and insulin-treated diabetic control rats with only mild hyperglucagonemia. A reduction in glucagon binding sites did not occur with hyperglucagonemia of 12 h or less. Despite the reduced binding of glucagon in the three chronically hyperglucagonemic groups, the ability of glucagon to stimulate cAMP production was not reduced. It is concluded that while decreased glucagon binding occures in the forms of chronic hyperglucagonemia studied, it is not associated with a reduction in the ability of glucagon to stimulate cAMP production."
https://openalex.org/W2107789955,"Poly(A)-containing RNA, isolated from rat ventral prostate, has been analyzed for its base sequence complexity. The kinetics of hybridization of total cellular poly(A)-containing RNA with its complementary DNA (cDNA) from normal and castrated animals are markedly different. RNA from normal animals consists of three abundance classes, about 36% comprises one or two highly abundant RNA sequences, 29% consists of about 24 sequences and the remainder is a scarce class of approximately 8200 sequences. In contrast, the hybridization kinetics of prostatic RNA from castrated animals demonstrate that there is a moderate abundance class of 53 sequences and a scarce class of about 7800 sequences, but that a class of abundant sequences is not present. Using normal prostatic cDNA as a probe, we showed that the abundant sequences were not absent but reduced 10 fold following a 3-day castration period and 100 fold after 7 days. Such heterologous hybridization experiments also suggest that there is significant sequence homology in the RNA sequences present in the prostate irrespective of the hormonal status of the animals. The major effect of testosterone appears to be the regulation of the abundance of specific RNA sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2011331626,"Abstract Long-term cultures of proliferating hematopoietic stem cells derived from bone marrow permit the study of the interaction between murine leukemia virus (MuLV) infection and the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells. We have used this system to analyze the replication of different biological variants of MuLV in bone marrow cells; the effect of MuLV infection upon pluripotent stem cell (CFU-S) proliferation; and the effect of MuLV on differentiation of CFU-S along different hematopoietic pathways. Two MuLV variants were studied in detail: the Moloney strain of lymphatic leukemia virus (Mol-MuLV) and the erythroleukemic Friend virus complex (FLV) consisting of the lymphoid leukemia helper virus and the defective spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV). Mol-MuLV and its sarcoma virus pseudotype, MSV(Mol-MuLV), replicate efficiently in the bone marrow cultures; however, CFU-S are lost more readily than in uninfected cultures, and the cultures are soon represented by a majority population of mononuclear macrophages. On the other hand, infection with FLV produces a prolonged survival of the spleen colony-forming cells, CFU-S, and CFU-C (the committed granulocytic precursor cells). Production of erythroleukemogenic SFFV is maintained in these cultures for more than 40 weeks. No erythroblastic differentiation was observed in vitro, however, neither erythroblast precursor cells (CFU-E) nor hemoglobin-producing cells could be detected. This suggests that the target cell for FLV is an earlier precursor cell."

Glass and rubber surgical glove surfaces produce similar cell damage. This phenomenon may be important in many surgical procedures and appears to be preventable if a hydrophilic polymer interface is interposed between contacting tissue and the surfaces of materials used.
https://openalex.org/W2015911028,"A cDNA copy of purified chick embryonic skeletal myosin heavy chain mRNA (MHC mRNA) distinguished between myogenic and nonmyogenic cells compared by in vitro and in situ hybridization. The majority of cells in replicating mononucleate myogenic cell cultures contained no detectable MHC mRNA. Among the earliest cells to contain MHC mRNA were cells engaged in mitosis. A relatively large amount of MHC mRNA was found in postmitotic monucleate cells and myotubes, and we observed nucleolar localization of MHC mRNA in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2055065547,"The uptake of liposomes bearing positive, negative, or no net charge on their membrane and containing a radioactive tracer, [99mTc]diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, was studied in 12 intact dogs 24 hours after the induction of myocardial infarction, and compared to the relative regional myocardial blood flow determined from radioactive microspheres. Positively charged and neutral liposomes concentrate in infarcted regions against a flow gradient, while negative liposomes are passively distributed according to regional blood flow. Because positively charged and neutral lipisomes concentrate in infarct areas and have the ability to incorporate pharmacologic agents in their aqueous or lipid phase, they may serve as vehicles for drug delivery to infarct zones of low flow."
https://openalex.org/W1521503901,"Previous studies from this laboratory (Forsee, W. T., and Elbein, A. D. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 9283-9293; Forsee, W. T., Valkovich, G., and Elbein, A. D. (1976) Arch Biochem. Biophys. 174, 469-479) have shown that particulate extracts from cotton fibers and mung been seedlings catalyze the transfer of mannose from GDP-[14C]mannose and GlcNAc from UDP-[3H]GlcNAc into lipid-linked saccharides, Concentrations of tunicamycin of 5 microgram/ml or higher inhibit the incorporation of GlcNAc into GlcNAc-pyrophosphoryl-polyprenol but this antibiotic, even at 500 microgram/ml, had no effect on the synthesis of mannosyl-phosphoryldolichol. Tunicamycin also caused a slight inhibition in the incorporation of mannose into lipid-linked oligosaccharides. The concentration of tunicamycin necessary for inhibition was dependent on the amount of particulate enzyme in the incubations."

https://openalex.org/W1972960954,"Infusions of monosodium-L-glutamate into the rostral hypothalamus, believed to contain neurons mediating satiety, produced persistent hyperphagia and obesity, thus suggesting that a brain lesion had been produced. Similar infusions into the caudal hypothalamus, believed to contain unmyelinated axons of passage that mediate satiety, failed to alter food intake or body weight. Histological examination of the affected tissue confirmed the behavioral evidence that suggests that this technique spares axons but destroys cell bodies. Infusion of several other amino acids also damaged neurons while sparing axons of passage."
https://openalex.org/W2054631939,"An HGPRT− cell line derived from mouse L cells has been shown to have the following properties: it is CRM+; the defective HGPRT molecules are altered in the carboxyterminal peptide; the mutant cells regain HGPRT activity when ochre-suppressor tRNA is microinjected into them, but not when amber-suppressor or wild-type tRNAs are injected. We conclude from these properties that this mutant cell line contains an ochre nonsense mutation (UAA) in the structural gene for HGPRT."
https://openalex.org/W2018610429,"One and five-tenths milligrams of [3H8]thromboxane B2 (12.2 Ci/mol) was infused at a maximum rate of 6.4 microgram/min into a healthy male volunteer. Seventy-four per cent of the infused radioactivity was recovered in the urine within 13 h. Urinary metabolites of thromboxane B2 were isolated by reversed phase partition chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography. The major urinary metabolite was found to represent approximately 16.8% of the total radioactivity in the urine. The structure of this metabolite was shown by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to be 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2, the product of a single step of beta-oxidation. The rate of excretion of infused radioactivity and the relative percentage represented by 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2 in the urine of man are very similar and the major urinary metabolite identical to that previously found by us in the non-human primate."
https://openalex.org/W2071896861,"A short RNA covalently associated with nascent DNA has been isolated after synthesis in vitro with labeled ribonucleaside triphosphates and the removal of DNA by DNAase digestion. The RNA migrates in polyacrylamide gels or chromatographs on DEAE-Sephadex columns as a relatively discrete oligonucleotide 8-11 nucleotides in length. The RNA is associated primarily with nascent DNA with stoichiometry of approximately one per DNA chain. The RNA has a triphosphate group at the 5' end and 2 or 3 deoxynucleotide residues at the 3' end that are not removed by DNAase. These results further support a role for the RNA as an initiator of discontinuous DNA synthesis. Examination of sequences present at the 3' end of the RNA using RNAase to effect transfer of 32PO4 from 32P-labeled DNA to covalently attached RNA indicates that a diverse, rather than unique, set of sequences are present in the RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1539534461,"The regulation of neutral amino acid transport was examined utilizing two temperature-sensitive aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase mutants, by comparison of their transport activities at permissive and marginally permissive temperatures. When the temperature-sensitive leucyl-tRNA -synthetase mutant tsH1 was shifted from a normal growth temperature of 34 degrees to a marginally permissive temperature for growth of 38%, a significant enhancement in the initial rate of uptake of leucine and other L system amino acids was observed when compared with that of the parental cells (CHO-S). In contrast, the uptake of A system-specific amino acids (alanine, glycine, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid) showed no significant differences relative to the parent strain. In a similar manner, a temperature-sensitive asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase mutant RJK-4 exhibited a significant enhancement of the transport activity of A system amino acids relative to its parental strain RJK-0 when the growth temperature was shifted from 33 degrees to 39.5 degrees. Preliminary kinetic data suggest that the Vmax for transport is increased when the mutants are grown under conditions of amino acid limitation. These experiments suggest that the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase or a related product may function in the regulation of neutral amino acid transport in Chinese hamster cells."
https://openalex.org/W2065547796,"Five metal salts (lead, cadmium, cobalt, copper, and manganese),which are mutagenic or carcinogenic, decreasing the fidelity of DNA synthesis in vitro, stimulated chain initiation of RNA synthesis at concentrations that inhibited overall RNA synthesis. In contrast, other metal salts (zinc, magnesium, lithium, sodium,and potassium) not in this category inhibited chain initiation of RNA synthesis at concentrations that inhibited overall RNA synthesis."

These represent significant increases over the frequencies observed in previous years. Epizootiological data suggest that environmental goitrogens (possibly pollutants) may be involved in the etiology of the thyroid disorder."
https://openalex.org/W1964375264,"Two electrophoretically distinct variants of glyoxalase I (Glo-I) are present in mouse (Mus musculus). The two forms are controlled by two codominant alleles Glo-1a (common) and Glo-1b (rare) at an autosomal locus. A linkage study showed that Glo-1 maps at approximately 3 centimorgans from the Ss locus of the H-2 histocompatibility region. A similar linkage relationship exists in man between GLO and HLA, the human homolog of the H-2 gene complex. Thus, the chromosomal segment evolutionarily preserved in the two species is longer than previously suspected, and it includes genes with no obvious functional relation to the other components of the major histocompatibility complex. Several features of the Glo-1 polymorphism in the mouse recommend it as a marker of choice for the H-2 region."

A similar, but more variable, diminution is observed in the case of patients with this disorder. The change in fatty acid composition appears related to a low membrane triglyceride content and may provide both a possible technique for carrier detection and a clue regarding pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1498304215,"A protein kinase, which was produced from its proenzyme occurring in rat brain upon limited proteolysis by a Ca2+-dependent protease from the same tissue (Inoue, M., Kishimoto, A., Takai, Y., and Nishizlka, Y. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 7610-7616, was capable of phosphorylating alpha and beta subunits of rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen phosphorylase kinase, resulting in a marked enhancement of the enzymatic activity. This protein kinase was entirely independent of cyclic nucleotides and differed from the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. The activation of phosphorylase kinase by this active protein kinase was not inhibited by a protein inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, nor by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N',N'-tetraacetic acid, which prevented autophosphorylation of phosphorylase kinase. The proenzyme was distinguishable from cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, since it did not bind cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP, and was inactive in the phosphorylation and activation of phosphorylase kinase both in the presence and absence of these cyclic nucleotides. Neither the protein kinase nor its proenzyme showed phosphorylase kinase activity. Available evidence indicates that the Ca2+-activated, cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinase system as well as cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase shows an ability to stimulate glycogen breakdown as far as tested in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2045824456,"Experimentally induced hypoxia in kittens precipitated episodes of depressed respiration and irregular cardiac function during quiet sleep, waking, and transitional states. The onset of active sleep stimulated both breathing and heart rate and decreased abnormal variability in these functions. However, hypoxia markedly reduced the proportion of active sleep. These data suggest that active sleep protects against respiratory and cardiac abnormalities in infants. Chronic hypoxemia or other factors that reduce active sleep in infants, including the normal developmental decrement in this state, may increase the risk of cardiopulmonary failure and death."
https://openalex.org/W2048377951,"Scientist's norms (principally honesty, objectivity, tolerance, doubt of certitude, and unselfish engagement) are in danger of serious distortion unless broadened to apply to the relations between scientists and nonscientists. Also needing supplementation is an ethic of development appropriate to a fast-changing society and advanced as an approach to the more effective and humane regulation of cultural and technological development. Because of their genetic relationships the code of the scientist and the ethic of development are probably complementary and together may overcome the shortcomings of each taken separately. Taken together, furthermore, they indicate the possibility of a humane world order based on the cooperation of a community of scientists and its public."

https://openalex.org/W1959113469,"The effects of thyroid status on muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the rat myocardium were investigated. The potent muscarinic antagonist [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate was used to identify muscarinic cholinergic receptors in rat heart particulate fractions from control, hypothyroid, and hyperthyroid rats. Thyroidectomy increased specific [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to heart particulate fractions by about 60% as compared to euthyroid rat cardiac preparations. Administration of triiodothyronine to euthyroid rats decreased specific binding to muscarinic cholinergic receptors by about 20%. Scatchard analysis revealed that the cardiac particulate fraction from thyroidectomized rats contained 134 fmol of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding sites per mg of protein, as compared with 85 fmol/mg of protein found in the heart preparation of thyroidectomized rats chrinically treated with triiodothyronine. The equilibrium dissociation constant for the interaction of receptors with quinuclidinyl benzilate was the same (1 nM) in the heart particulate fractions derived from these two groups of rats. The results of this study demonstrate that thyroid hormone can regulate the number of cardiac muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Thus, the parasympathetic nervous system may participate in the cardiovascular abnormalities in different thyroid states."
https://openalex.org/W2054590525,"Chinese hamster cells selected for resistance to 8-azaguanine following mutagenesis have hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT; E.C. 2.4.2.8) with characteristics compatible with different mutations in the structural gene for that enzyme. Using immunopurification and SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, mutants producing antigenically active forms of the enzyme can be analyzed for changes in the molecular weight of HGPRT. Enzyme subunits from mutants RJK3 and RJK39 are reduced in molecular weight by an estimated 4 and 2%, respectively. HGPRT activity is not detectable in RJK39. The enzyme from RJK3 is active but has altered substrate binding properties. Enzymes from two other mutants with altered kinetic properties, RJK44 and RJK47, have normal molecular weights. The genetic alterations of RJK44 and 47 are probably missense mutations, while RJK3 and 39 might contain either deletions or mutations causing premature peptide chain termination. Somatic cell hybridization between RJK39 and a revertant of that strain with HGPRT of normal molecular weight revealed that the revertant probably arose by intragenic mutation rather than extragenic mutation or suppression."

Similar histone dimers are found in both conformational states of chromatin. The dimers most frequently found are H2b-H2a, H2b-H3 and H3-H2a; dimers found less frequently are H3-H4, H3-H3 and H2b-H4. More H3-H3 is found in nuclei than in extended chromatin. H1 is found predominantly as poly-H1, although it can be cross-linked to H2b or H3. After reaction with MMB, native compact chromatin is no longer extendable in 6 M urea, which shows that the reagent is capable of linking together histones holding the chromatin in a compact conformation. Thus the histone propinquity in extended chromatin mimics the intimate histone associations in compact chromatin."
