https://openalex.org/W2052735134,"Combination of seven surveys of blood parasites in North American passerines reveals weak, highly significant association over species between incidence of chronic blood infections (five genera of protozoa and one nematode) and striking display (three characters: male ""brightness,"" female ""brightness,"" and male song). This result conforms to a model of sexual selection in which (i) coadaptational cycles of host and parasites generate consistently positive offspring-on-parent regression of fitness, and (ii) animals choose mates for genetic disease resistance by scrutiny of characters whose full expression is dependent on health and vigor."
https://openalex.org/W1990162531,"Human neonates (average age, 36 hours) discriminated three facial expressions (happy, sad, and surprised) posed by a live model as evidenced by diminished visual fixation on each face over trials and renewed fixations to the presentation of a different face. The expressions posed by the model, unseeen by the observer, were guessed at greater than chance accuracy simply by observing the face of the neonate, whose facial movements in the brow, eyes, and mouth regions provided evidence for imitation of the facial expressions."
https://openalex.org/W2078490793,"Cultural phenomena may show considerable stability over time and space. Transmission mechanisms responsible for their maintenance are worthy of theoretical and empirical inquiry; they are complex and each possible pathway has different effects on evolutionary stability of traits, as can be shown theoretically. A survey designed to evaluate the importance of some components of cultural transmission on a variety of traits showed that religion and politics are mostly determined in the family, a mode of transmission which guarantees high evolutionary stability and maintenance of high variation between and within groups."
https://openalex.org/W1991326779,"Platelet-activating factor caused rapid pulmonary vasoconstriction and edema in isolated lungs perfused with albumin-free salt solution devoid of formed blood elements. These effects may be due in part to the action of leukotrienes D4 and C4, which were identified by bioassay and high-pressure liquid chromatography in the lung effluent after stimulation by platelet-activating factor. These findings help illuminate some of the deleterious effects that platelet-activating factor elicits in anaphylactic reactions and possibly in other forms of lung injury."

https://openalex.org/W2034081515,"In an eight-arm radial maze, normal rats demonstrated good immediate retention for the order of first items (primacy component of serial position curve) and last items (recency component of serial position curve) of an eight-item (arm) list. In contrast, rats with dorsal hippocampal lesions displayed, on an immediate retention test, disruption of the primacy but not the recency component of the serial position curve. Furthermore, imposing a 10-minute delay before the retention test impaired all components of the serial position curve. These results support correspondence in mnemonic function of the hippocampus in animals and humans."

https://openalex.org/W2092268568,"Topical application of convulsants to the rat sensorimotor cortex in concentrations sufficient to cause repetitive focal motor seizures resulted in acute neuropathology (dark cell neuronal degeneration and spongiform neurophil changes) involving both the cortical seizure focus and certain thalamic nuclei within seizure pathways. Changes in the cortex were localized primarily in layer IV and those in the thalamus in nuclei having reciprocal connections with the cortical focus. The spongiform neuropil changes consisted of massively dilated presynaptic axon terminals in the cortex and postsynaptic dendrites in the thalamus. The dendritic and dark cell changes resemble the excitotoxic damage caused by glutamate and aspartate. Since these putative transmitters may be released locally from recurrent collaterals and remotely from corticothalamic axons, excessive release of glutamate or aspartate may account for the changes in both sites. The abnormal axons in sensory cortex appear to be terminals of thalamocortical neurons. Swelling of these axons may be caused by excessive anti- and orthodromic firing in the course of focal motor seizures."
https://openalex.org/W2046330056,"Rats whose pregnancies were surgically terminated on day 17 of gestation were injected with morphine, morphine plus naloxone hydrochloride, or saline, and then tested for maternal responsiveness toward foster young. Morphine treatment alone significantly disrupted the rate of onset and quality of maternal responsiveness. Concurrent administration of naloxone to morphine-injected rats reinstated the rapid onset of behavioral responsiveness toward foster young, such that the responsiveness of the rats treated with both morphine and naloxone was indistinguishable from that shown by saline-injected controls. The disruptive effects of morphine did not appear to result from a general reduction in activity levels as measured in an open-field apparatus. These findings suggest that the normal onset and maintenance of maternal behavior in the rat may be regulated by endogenous opiates."

https://openalex.org/W2081294871,"Bacteria possess proteases that are specific for the peptide bonds between D-alanine residues, one of which has a free α-carboxyl group. These D-alanyl-D-alanine peptidases catalyse carboxypeptidation and transpeptidation reactions involved in bacterial cell wall metabolism1,2, and are inactivated by β-lactam antibiotics. We have now elucidated the structure, at 2.5 A resolution, of the penicillin-resistant Zn2+-containing D-alanyl-D-alanine peptidase of Streptomyces albus (Zn2+ G peptidase)3,4. The enzyme is shown to consist of two globular domains, connected by a single link. The N-terminal domain has three α-helices, and the C-terminal domain has three α-helices and five β-strands. The Zn2+ ion is ligated by three histidine residues, and located in a cleft in the C-terminal domain. The mechanism of action of the enzyme may be related to that of other carboxypeptidases, which also contain functional Zn2+ ions."

https://openalex.org/W2036798945,"Rats rotated to the left when 5′-N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine (NECA) was injected into the left caudate nucleus and apomorphine was administered subcutaneously. The combination of NECA and apomorphine was more potent than L-(phenylisopropyl)adenosine and apomorphine in eliciting rotation, suggesting the involvement of adenosine receptors of the Ra type. The response was reduced when 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine was injected along with NECA into the caudate nucleus or when theophylline was given intraperitoneally. Higher doses of apomorphine elicited a self-mutilatory response after the injection of NECA into the caudate nucleus. These results suggest that adenosine may be involved in the modulation of dopaminergic function in the striatum."

https://openalex.org/W1567212500,"Two protein kinases (chloroplast protein kinases 1 and 2 (ChlPK1 and ChlPK2)) were isolated from spinach chloroplasts. After solubilization of the chloroplasts with octylglucoside and cholate, these kinases were purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, sucrose gradient centrifugation, and hydroxylapatite chromatography. ChlPK1 traveled as a single band in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis corresponding to 25,000 daltons; ChlPK2 traveled as a single band corresponding to 38,000 daltons. After exposure to 8-azido-[gamma-32P]ATP, the radioactive bands appeared in the same positions revealed by Coomassie blue staining. However, a trace of ChlPK2 was detected in the ChlPK1 preparation and a faint second lower molecular weight radioactive band was seen in the ChlPK2 preparations. Both enzymes acted on casein or histone IIIS as substrate and phosphorylated a serine residue. The proteolytic peptide maps, however, were clearly distinguishable in autoradiograms, suggesting that different serine residues were phosphorylated by ChlPK1 and ChlPK2."
https://openalex.org/W2011703589,"The biotin-binding site on avidin has been labeled with biotin conjugated to undecagold, an organometallic cluster compound containing 11 gold atoms in a core angestroms in diameter. Examination of unstained specimens by scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals the labeled sites directly, without computational averaging or filtering of the images. This approach should be widely applicable for determining the locations of subunits and functional site in biological macromolecules at a resolution at a resolution in range of 15 angstroms."

https://openalex.org/W1495523186,"The initiation of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme-catalyzed reaction is blocked by antibody directed against the beta subunit; elongation is unaffected (Johanson, K., and McHenry, C. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 10984-10990). We have developed an immunological method for quantitating nanogram quantities of beta in reaction complexes. Using this method, we have demonstrated that beta is present in all stages of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme reaction. Upon initiation complex formation, the antigenic determinants of beta become inaccessible to anti-beta immunoglobulin G. The methods described herein should be generally applicable to the study of a variety of multienzyme complexes. Even after conversion of a primed G4 single strand to the duplex replicative form, beta does not readily dissociate. This creates a kinetic barrier to the overall holoenzyme replicative reaction."

Mouse blastocysts grown in vitro for 10 days showed blood circulation in the yilk sac, forelimb buds, and the primordia of liver, pancreas, and lungs. These characteristics are indicative of a developmental stage equivalent to one-half of the total gestation period in utero. Improvements in culture conditions from days 7 to 9 have made it feasible to culture mouse blastocysts beyond the early somite stage."

https://openalex.org/W1481031286,"A multisubstrate analog, formed by joining coenzyme A with spermidine through an acetic acid linkage, serves as a strong inhibitor (Ki less than 10(-8) M) of the acetylation of spermidine and histones by histone acetylase purified from calf thymus. In free solutions, this analog inhibited acetylation of the various nuclear histones to a similar extent. In isolated nuclei, this analog was found to inhibit acetylation of histones H2a and H2b very much more strongly than that of histones H3 and H4."

https://openalex.org/W1551589116,"We have reported previously that 17 beta-estradiol reduces the amount of procollagen type III produced in cultured bovine aortic smooth muscle cells. The effect of cell density and estradiol on the production of collagen in second passage cultures has been further evaluated. In agreement with our previous findings, at day 14, significant differences in [14C]hydroxyproline production were detected between hormone-treated and control cultures. To further relate this observation to cell culture density and estradiol treatment, collagen production was evaluated after a 1-h pulse period. Quantities of assembled procollagen molecules and the individual collagenous polypeptides were determined by DEAE-cellulose chromatography or by immunoprecipitation. As cell numbers increased with time in culture, an augmented production of both procollagen types I and III was observed. The increased production of total type III collagen and procollagen molecules lagged behind type I production. Thus, it was found that the ratio of procollagen type I to type III decreased with days in culture from 2.7 to 1.0, and the ratio of the total of each type decreased from 7.5 to 3.4. In the presence of 1.0 x 10(-8) M estradiol, the level of type III collagen was reduced by approximately 50% at all culture times. The production of procollagen type I was not affected and remained equivalent in both hormone-treated and control cultures. The different ratios obtained by the two methods indicates that procollagen type I is processed more rapidly than procollagen type III in the 1-hour pulse period."

https://openalex.org/W2071214845,"Direct measurements of capillary transit times in dog lungs were made by using in vivo television microscopy. Mean transit times were unexpectedly long. As pulmonary artery pressures were raised, transit times decreased, suggesting that the normally existing hydrostatic pressure gradient in the lung causes a vertical distribution of transit times. The more rapid transit times approached the minimum time required for complete oxygenation."
https://openalex.org/W2091195998,"Protein phosphorylation in cerebral cell-free preparations from neonate rabbits was inhibited by bilirubin and promoted by aminophylline when these substances had been administered intravenously. In animals given both compounds, the bilirubin-induced inhibition of phosphorylation was partly reversed by aminophylline. Adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate added in vitro during the assays also increased protein phosphorylation. These data introduce new concepts in the pathogenesis of kernicterus."

https://openalex.org/W1501635287,"An NAD(P)-dependent malic enzyme with a specific activity of 40.6 mumol of NADH/min/mg of protein and an isoelectric point of 5.4 was purified to apparent homogeneity from canine small intestinal mucosal mitochondria. The purification procedure employed ammonium sulfate fractionation, Sepharose CL 6B gel filtration, chromatography on DEAE-cellulose to remove the interfering malate dehydrogenase, and affinity chromatography on 2',5'-ADP-Sepharose and NAD-agarose to take advantage of the dual coenzyme specificity. Antibody prepared from the purified enzyme produced a single peak upon cross-rocket immunoelectrophoresis against the mitochondrial sonicate. Continuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed NAD and NADP activity co-migrating with the native protein band. A single band of protein having an apparent Mr = 62,000 was seen on sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis. At pH 7.3, gel filtration revealed a single peak of activity with NAD and NADP corresponding to an apparent Mr = 282,000. Gradient gel polyacrylamide electrophoresis at pH 9.0 indicated an additional broad band of activity corresponding to a Mr = 141,000. Under physiological conditions therefore the protein appears to exist as a tetramer of Mr = 282,000 composed of four equal subunits, whereas at elevated pH values during electrophoresis, partial dissociation to a dimeric species occurs."

These studies have revealed that each homolog is a mixture of two isomers differing in double bond location. In each of the three homologs examined, approximately equal amounts of two isomers were present as follows: (formula: see text)."

https://openalex.org/W1483897213,"The volume change for the gelation of deoxygenated sickle cell hemoglobin has been measured by dilatometry at 22.0 degrees C and found to be zero. The precision of the result is 0 +/- 1.4 ml/mol of protein present in the sample. When the solubility of the protein is taken into account, the precision is 0 +/- 5.1 ml/mol of gelled hemoglobin. The participation of interactions in sickle cell hemoglobin gelation and model compound studies of the volume change associated with transferring hydrophobic solutes from an aqueous to a hydrophobic milieu, as well as the volume changes of other globular protein polymerizations, led us, initially, to expect a large positive delta V. The results are discussed in the context of concentration effects in sickle cell hemoglobin solutions and of recent work on the pressure-induced denaturation of globular proteins, which also gives smaller volume effects than had been anticipated."
