https://openalex.org/W1994389850,"In multicellular plants, development starts with an asymmetric division of the zygote into two differentiated cells. The nature and distribution of fate-determining factors operating during embryogenesis remain largely obscure. Laser microsurgery was used here to dissect two-celled embryos of the alga Fucus spiralis. Removal of protoplasts from the cell wall induced dedifferentiation. However, isolated cells within the walls followed their restricted fate. Moreover, contact of one cell type with the isolated cell wall of the other cell type caused its fate to be switched. The cell wall thus appears to maintain the differentiated state and to direct cell fate in plant development."
https://openalex.org/W2079020852,"The interfacial shear stress that occurs when a network of a polymer that is highly mobile at the segment level (an elastomer) is slid over a smooth surface of an immobile (glassy) polymer has been measured. The glassy material is covered by a thin layer of end-attached chains of the mobile material. The experiment was designed so that there were no free chains at the interface; the slip occurred between network chains on the one side and rigid material plus end-attached mobile chains on the other side. Two main results were obtained. (i) The interfacial shear stress is strongly affected by the segment mobility of the materials on both sides of the slip plane, and considerably lower stress is observed when the materials on both sides of the interface are highly mobile. (ii) Very thin layers of tethered chains can increase the interfacial friction. Both results are relevant to the understanding of a number of practical situations that range from the operation of thin layers of lubricants, such as those found in magnetic storage devices, to the problem of wall slip and melt fracture in polymer processing."
https://openalex.org/W1987149333,"The presence of a cytosolic pH gradient and its relation to polar tip growth was investigated in rhizoid cells of Pelvetia embryos with the use of pH-sensitive microelectrodes and by ratio imaging. Growing rhizoid cells generated a longitudinal pH gradient in which the apical cytosol was 0.3 to 0.5 units more acidic than the cytosol at the base of the cell. Treatment with a membrane-permeant weak acid, propionic acid, dissipated the cytosolic pH gradient and inhibited growth. The magnitude of the pH gradient correlated well with the rate of tip elongation. The pH gradient spatially superimposed on the cytosolic calcium gradient, and inhibition of calcium fluxes by treatment with lanthanum abolished the pH gradient and inhibited growth."

https://openalex.org/W1963554941,"Evidence of structural inhomogeneities in two high-transition-temperature superconductors, YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7-delta) and Nd2-xCexCuO4-y, is presented. When samples were illuminated by highly collimated x-rays produced on a synchrotron wiggler, small changes in the lattice were detected over a spatial scale of 10 micrometers. These changes are interpreted as evidence of variations in the oxygen content in one case and in the cerium content in the other; both affect the superconducting properties. The existence of such structural inhomogeneities brings into question whether exotic experimental results obtained from superconducting materials with high transition temperatures actually reflect intrinsic properties."
