https://openalex.org/W3086125063,"Analysis of the specificity and kinetics of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for understanding immune protection and identifying targets for vaccine design. In a cohort of 647 SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects, we found that both the magnitude of Ab responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleoprotein and nAb titers correlate with clinical scores. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) is immunodominant and the target of 90% of the neutralizing activity present in SARS-CoV-2 immune sera. Whereas overall RBD-specific serum IgG titers waned with a half-life of 49 days, nAb titers and avidity increased over time for some individuals, consistent with affinity maturation. We structurally defined an RBD antigenic map and serologically quantified serum Abs specific for distinct RBD epitopes leading to the identification of two major receptor-binding motif antigenic sites. Our results explain the immunodominance of the receptor-binding motif and will guide the design of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W3084653951,"The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein variant D614G supplanted the ancestral virus worldwide, reaching near fixation in a matter of months. Here we show that D614G was more infectious than the ancestral form on human lung cells, colon cells, and on cells rendered permissive by ectopic expression of human ACE2 or of ACE2 orthologs from various mammals, including Chinese rufous horseshoe bat and Malayan pangolin. D614G did not alter S protein synthesis, processing, or incorporation into SARS-CoV-2 particles, but D614G affinity for ACE2 was reduced due to a faster dissociation rate. Assessment of the S protein trimer by cryo-electron microscopy showed that D614G disrupts an interprotomer contact and that the conformation is shifted toward an ACE2 binding-competent state, which is modeled to be on pathway for virion membrane fusion with target cells. Consistent with this more open conformation, neutralization potency of antibodies targeting the S protein receptor-binding domain was not attenuated."
https://openalex.org/W3091214020,"Understanding humoral responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical for improving diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Deep serological profiling of 232 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and 190 pre-COVID-19 era controls using VirScan revealed more than 800 epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, including 10 epitopes likely recognized by neutralizing antibodies. Preexisting antibodies in controls recognized SARS-CoV-2 ORF1, whereas only COVID-19 patient antibodies primarily recognized spike protein and nucleoprotein. A machine learning model trained on VirScan data predicted SARS-CoV-2 exposure history with 99% sensitivity and 98% specificity; a rapid Luminex-based diagnostic was developed from the most discriminatory SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Individuals with more severe COVID-19 exhibited stronger and broader SARS-CoV-2 responses, weaker antibody responses to prior infections, and higher incidence of cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus 1, possibly influenced by demographic covariates. Among hospitalized patients, males produce stronger SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses than females."
https://openalex.org/W3084924559,"Initially, children were thought to be spared from disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, a month into the epidemic, a novel multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) emerged. Herein, we report on the immune profiles of nine MIS-C cases. All MIS-C patients had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, mounting an antibody response with intact neutralization capability. Cytokine profiling identified elevated signatures of inflammation (IL-18 and IL-6), lymphocytic and myeloid chemotaxis and activation (CCL3, CCL4, and CDCP1), and mucosal immune dysregulation (IL-17A, CCL20, and CCL28). Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood revealed reductions of non-classical monocytes, and subsets of NK and T lymphocytes, suggesting extravasation to affected tissues. Finally, profiling the autoantigen reactivity of MIS-C plasma revealed both known disease-associated autoantibodies (anti-La) and novel candidates that recognize endothelial, gastrointestinal, and immune-cell antigens. All patients were treated with anti-IL-6R antibody and/or IVIG, which led to rapid disease resolution."
https://openalex.org/W3088648928,"A mysterious feature of Crohn’s disease (CD) is the extra-intestinal manifestation of “creeping fat” (CrF), defined as expansion of mesenteric adipose tissue around the inflamed and fibrotic intestine. In the current study, we explore whether microbial translocation in CD serves as a central cue for CrF development. We discovered a subset of mucosal-associated gut bacteria that consistently translocated and remained viable in CrF in CD ileal surgical resections, and identified Clostridium innocuum as a signature of this consortium with strain variation between mucosal and adipose isolates, suggesting preference for lipid-rich environments. Single-cell RNA sequencing characterized CrF as both pro-fibrotic and pro-adipogenic with a rich milieu of activated immune cells responding to microbial stimuli, which we confirm in gnotobiotic mice colonized with C. innocuum. Ex vivo validation of expression patterns suggests C. innocuum stimulates tissue remodeling via M2 macrophages, leading to an adipose tissue barrier that serves to prevent systemic dissemination of bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W3088385305,"Non-coding mutations at the far end of a large gene desert surrounding the SOX9 gene result in a human craniofacial disorder called Pierre Robin sequence (PRS). Leveraging a human stem cell differentiation model, we identify two clusters of enhancers within the PRS-associated region that regulate SOX9 expression during a restricted window of facial progenitor development at distances up to 1.45 Mb. Enhancers within the 1.45 Mb cluster exhibit highly synergistic activity that is dependent on the Coordinator motif. Using mouse models, we demonstrate that PRS phenotypic specificity arises from the convergence of two mechanisms: confinement of Sox9 dosage perturbation to developing facial structures through context-specific enhancer activity and heightened sensitivity of the lower jaw to Sox9 expression reduction. Overall, we characterize the longest-range human enhancers involved in congenital malformations, directly demonstrate that PRS is an enhanceropathy, and illustrate how small changes in gene expression can lead to morphological variation."
https://openalex.org/W3090913780,"Objective COVID-19 pandemic led to major life changes. We assessed the psychological impact of COVID-19 on dental academics globally and on changes in their behaviors. Methods We invited dental academics to complete a cross-sectional, online survey from March to May 2020. The survey was based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The survey collected data on participants’ stress levels (using the Impact of Event Scale), attitude (fears, and worries because of COVID-19 extracted by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), perceived control (resulting from training on public health emergencies), norms (country-level COVID-19 fatality rate), and personal and professional backgrounds. We used multilevel regression models to assess the association between the study outcome variables (frequent handwashing and avoidance of crowded places) and explanatory variables (stress, attitude, perceived control and norms). Results 1862 academics from 28 countries participated in the survey (response rate = 11.3%). Of those, 53.4% were female, 32.9% were <46 years old and 9.9% had severe stress. PCA extracted three main factors: fear of infection, worries because of professional responsibilities, and worries because of restricted mobility. These factors had significant dose-dependent association with stress and were significantly associated with more frequent handwashing by dental academics (B = 0.56, 0.33, and 0.34) and avoiding crowded places (B = 0.55, 0.30, and 0.28). Low country fatality rates were significantly associated with more handwashing (B = -2.82) and avoiding crowded places (B = -6.61). Training on public health emergencies was not significantly associated with behavior change (B = -0.01 and -0.11). Conclusions COVID-19 had a considerable psychological impact on dental academics. There was a direct, dose-dependent association between change in behaviors and worries but no association between these changes and training on public health emergencies. More change in behaviors was associated with lower country COVID-19 fatality rates. Fears and stresses were associated with greater adoption of preventive measures against the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3091559212,"Objectives This study aims to describe the oral microbiome diversity and prevalence of ARGs in periodontal health and disease. Background The human oral cavity harbors a complex microbial community known as the oral microbiome. These organisms are regularly exposed to selective pressures, such as the usage of antibiotics, which drive evolution and acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Resistance among oral bacteria jeopardizes not only antibiotic therapy for oral infections, but also extra‐oral infections caused by bacterial translocation. Methods We carried out a cross-sectional investigation. Saliva and subgingival plaque samples were collected during a clinical exam. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to assess microbial diversity. Resistance genes were identified through PCR assays. Results Of the 110 participants, only 22.7% had healthy periodontium, while the majority was diagnosed with gingivitis (55.4%) and chronic periodontitis (21.8%). The composition of the oral microbiota differed from healthy and diseased samples, being Streptococcus spp. and Rothia spp. predominant in periodontal disease. Regarding ARGs, 80 (72.7%) samples were positive for at least one of genes screened, erm being the most frequent variant (58.2%), followed by blaTEM (16.4%), mecA (2.7%), pbp2b and aac(6 ') (1.8%). Neither genes coding resistance to carbapenems nor metronidazole were detected. Conclusions Our findings indicate that there are no significant differences in terms of taxonomic enrichment between healthy and diseased oral microbiomes. However, samples retrieved from healthy patients had a more diverse microbial community, whereas diseased samples have lower taxonomic diversity. We have also identified clinically relevant ARGs, providing baseline information to guide antibiotic prescription in dentistry."

Distinct synapse types in the mammalian brain differ substantially with respect to key functional properties, such as transmitter release probability (Pr), postsynaptic sensitivity, or synaptic plasticity. In this regard, two major open questions in synapse biology are whether distinct ultrastructural synaptic features contribute to or determine fundamentally different functional synapse properties, and how such ultrastructural features are linked to distinct molecular machines and pathways in health and disease (Brose et al., 2019Brose N.

Structural contributions to short-term synaptic plasticity.Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 69-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Addressing these issues experimentally is inherently difficult, as it requires the use of an experimental system where electrophysiological recordings and fixation for electron microscopy (EM) studies can be performed under identical conditions, allowing direct comparisons of functional and ultrastructural data—ideally in a tissue context. This is particularly challenging with regard to presynapses, where synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion occurs at millisecond timescales and endocytosis operates at millisecond-to-second rates. Aldehyde-based fixation for large-scale 3D EM applications of large tissue blocks are essential to preserve neuronal ultrastructure, e.g., for the study of brain connectivity (Motta et al., 2019Motta A.

However, the relatively slow diffusion of fixatives into tissue may alter presynaptic ultrastructure (Korogod et al., 2015Korogod N. Petersen C.C. Knott G.W.

Reese T.S. Use of aldehyde fixatives to determine the rate of synaptic transmitter release.J. Exp. Biol. 1980; 89: 19-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, accurate and direct correlations between ultrastructural information (e.g., the number of docked SVs at AZs) and defined synaptic activity states (e.g., short-term plasticity states) have been elusive. To link ultrastructural observations with defined functional states, near-native preservation of neuronal ultrastructure and a temporal frame of reference are required. Different cryo-fixation techniques have been developed to achieve this, including electrical-stimulation-coupled “slam freezing” (Heuser and Reese, 1981Heuser J.E. Reese T.S.

Corresponding studies showed compellingly that morphologically docked vesicles are functionally primed vesicles of the readily releasable pool (RRP) and that distinct modes of endocytosis with different kinetics operate in a variety of different systems, such as frog neuromuscular junctions (Heuser and Reese, 1981Heuser J.E.

Cell-specific synaptic activation of genetically identified neurons in brain circuits requires the use of optogenetics. However, applying optogenetics-based “flash-and-freeze” EM technology to brain tissue is not trivial. The objective of rapid freezing is to immobilize tissue water in a vitreous state and hence avoid ice crystal formation, which perturbs cellular ultrastructure. While thin samples, such as synaptosome preparations (Fernández-Busnadiego et al., 2010Fernández-Busnadiego R. Zuber B. Maurer U.E. Cyrklaff M. Baumeister W. Lucic V.

Further, satisfactory sample vitrification of acutely dissected or cultured brain sections typically requires the addition of external cryoprotectants (Dubochet, 1995Dubochet J.

The potential effects of external cryoprotectants on neuronal function are difficult to predict, but most cryoprotectants are poorly compatible with parallel electrophysiological experiments, so that functional control experiments have to be performed in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) alone, i.e., under conditions that do not match the conditions of parallel EM analyses. In essence, complementary, cell-specific electrophysiological, ultrastructural, and—ultimately—molecular analyses of synapses in mammalian brain tissue require a versatile experimental system. In the study presented here, we established such an experimental system, one that employs the same conditions for all relevant functional and ultrastructural readouts (Figure 1A; STAR Methods). Specifically, our workflow combines mouse genetics, to drive the expression of the light-gated ion channel Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in specific neuronal subpopulations, with electrophysiology techniques and “flash-and-freeze” EM of synapses in organotypic tissue explant cultures (Figure 1A). To demonstrate the potential of our approach, we focused on the complex hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) synapses, which connect hippocampal dentate gyrus granule cells (GCs) and cornu ammonis subfield 3 (CA3) pyramidal cells. This synapse exhibits a very low initial Pr along with distinct presynaptic short-term and long-term plasticity features (Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005Nicoll R.A. Schmitz D. Synaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fibre synapses.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 863-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). MF synapses are inherently difficult to recapitulate in dissociated neuron cultures (Rost et al., 2010Rost B.R. Breustedt J. Schoenherr A. Grosse G. Ahnert-Hilger G. Schmitz D.

However, morphological evidence of distinct modes of endocytosis and spatial information on the location of vesicle membrane fusion and retrieval events with respect to individual AZ release sites of MF synapses has been lacking. To reliably achieve good ultrastructural preservation of brain tissue in ACSF after HPF, we adopted the roller-tube organotypic slice culture system (Gähwiler, 1981Gähwiler B.H. Organotypic monolayer cultures of nervous tissue.J. Neurosci. Methods. 1981; 4: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, Gähwiler, 1984Gähwiler B.H. Slice cultures of cerebellar, hippocampal and hypothalamic tissue.Experientia. 1984; 40: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), growing mouse hippocampal slices directly on 6 mm sapphire disc freezing substrates (Figure 1B; STAR Methods), which are compatible with most HPF devices, such as the Leica EM ICE we used. Although acute brain slices are widely used for neuronal connectivity and network studies, we opted against them based on critical methodological considerations concerning key aspects of data quality and interpretation: Acute cortical vibratome slice preparations based on well-established protocols for slice electrophysiology experiments (Bischofberger et al., 2006Bischofberger J. Engel D. Li L. Geiger J.R.P.P. Jonas P. Geiger R.P. Patch-clamp recording from mossy fiber terminals in hippocampal slices.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2075-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) are only compatible with HPF when the focus lies on synaptic ultrastructure at rest (Korogod et al., 2015Korogod N. Petersen C.C. Knott G.W. Ultrastructural analysis of adult mouse neocortex comparing aldehyde perfusion with cryo fixation.eLife. 2015; 4: e05793Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar; Studer et al., 2014Studer D. Zhao S.

Protoc. 2014; 9: 1480-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and it is problematic to adopt this system directly for ultrastructural studies of optogenetically activated synapses. Even with optimized slicing procedures, severe tissue damage, including axon transection and the presence of functionally compromised synaptic boutons close to the slice surface (<10–20 μm), are observed (Bischofberger et al., 2006Bischofberger J. Engel D. Li L. Geiger J.R.P.P. Jonas P. Geiger R.P. Patch-clamp recording from mossy fiber terminals in hippocampal slices.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2075-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar; Korogod et al., 2015Korogod N. Petersen C.C. Knott G.W.

Protoc. 2014; 9: 1480-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In view of this, and without flanking connectomics approaches, it is essentially impossible to determine whether EM-imaged synapses are axonally connected to cell somata. It is difficult to predict—or experimentally assess—how, for example, axonally “disconnected” hMFBs compare to intact ones upon optogenetic stimulation. To somewhat reduce the risk posed by these issues, ACSF has to be supplemented with cryoprotectants to achieve adequate ultrastructural preservation of synapses deeper within the acute slice (>10 μm; Borges-Merjane et al., 2020Borges-Merjane C.

Protoc. 2014; 9: 1480-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This, however, creates another major problem, as corresponding electrophysiological control experiments, which are required to validate stimulation protocols, can typically not be performed reliably in the presence of cryoprotectants. Thus, electrophysiological validation data, obtained in ACSF alone, and ultrastructural data, obtained in the presence of cryoprotectants, are not directly relatable. Organotypic slice culture systems, on the other hand, are ideally compatible with the HPF technology since the tissue recovers from the slicing trauma and synapses closer to the surface can be imaged. In view of this key advantage, and because they recapitulate most functional and structural features of the synaptic connections (Maus et al., 2020Maus L. Lee C. Altas B. Sertel S.M. Weyand K.

Methods. 1981; 4: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), where glass coverslips or sapphire discs can serve as the culture substrate for brain tissue cultured in a plasma clot. In contrast to this, interface slices are free floating so that their position relative to the optical axis of the stimulation light and to the transparent sapphire disc cannot be controlled during HPF. Manipulations designed to minimize the latter issue, e.g., by increasing slice thickness or reducing freezing cavity depth, can only improve freezing quality at the risk of tissue compression. Our system allows the inversion of the sapphire disc prior to freezing without detachment of the tissue (Figure 1C). This maximizes the exposure of cells at the sapphire-tissue interface to the light stimulus in the freezer (Figure 1D). The loading of the freezing assembly is performed under red-light conditions (STAR Methods). Briefly, a sapphire disc is submerged in ACSF and an aluminum spacer ring is placed on top. The tissue is never directly manipulated with tools prior to freezing, as the sapphire disc carrying the slice is simply carefully taken out of the recovery chamber with forceps and inverted on top of the ring to close the freezing “sandwich.” We used a thin carbon coordinate system (<4 nm) to facilitate targeted ultramicrotomy of hippocampal subregions and to allow their relative position to be approximately correlated with the calibrated light intensity in the HPF chamber (Figure 1E; STAR Methods). Frozen explants on discs are then cryosubstituted using automated freeze substitution (Figure 1F) and embedded in epoxy resin for ultramicrotomy (Figures 1G–1J) and EM (Figures 1K–1P). Our experimental workflow allows the monitoring of tissue depth for each individual section and therefore to restrict analyses to synapses within 10 μm from the sapphire disc surface (STAR Methods). In this region, the specimens exhibited excellent cryopreservation in ACSF alone (Figures 1M–1P), and we consistently found high densities of hMFBs in CA3 stratum lucidum (Figures 1K–1M). We focused analyses exclusively on AZs that contacted spines and not dendrites, as the latter contain puncta adherentia that are often difficult to discriminate from AZs (Figure 1N). We first determined the ultrastructural organization of vesicle pools after HPF in wild-type slices frozen in ACSF at rest and in the presence of glutamate receptor blockers and 1 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX; Figures S1A–S1O).

It seems that asymptomatic population may contribute importantly to the spread of the disease. Transmission from asymptomatic pregnant patients’ needs to be characterized in larger population cohorts and symptom assessment needs to be standardized. Objective To assess the prevalence of SARS CoV-2 infection in an unselected obstetrical population and to describe their presentation and clinical evolution. Methods A cross-sectional study was designed. Medical records of pregnant women admitted at the Obstetrics & Gynecology department of Clínica Dávila for labor & delivery, between April 27th and June 7th, 2020 were reviewed. All patients were screened with RT-PCR for SARS CoV-2 at admission. After delivery, positive cases were inquired by the researchers for clinical symptoms presented before admission and clinical evolution. All neonates born from mothers with confirmed SARS CoV-2 were isolated and tested for SARS CoV-2 infection. Results A total of 586 patients were tested for SARS CoV-2 during the study period. Outcomes were obtained from 583 patients which were included in the study. Thirty-seven pregnant women had a positive test for SARS CoV-2 at admission. Cumulative prevalence of confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection was 6.35% (37/583) [CI 95%: 4.63–8.65]. From confirmed cases, 43.2% (16/37) were asymptomatic. From symptomatic patients 85.7% (18/21) had mild symptoms and evolved without complications and 14.3% (3/21) presented severe symptoms requiring admission to intensive care unit. Only 5.4% (2/37) of the neonates born to mothers with a positive test at admission had a positive RT-PCR for SARS CoV-2. Conclusion In our study nearly half of pregnant patients with SARS CoV-2 were asymptomatic at the time of delivery. Universal screening, in endemic areas, is necessary for adequate patient isolation, prompt neonatal testing and targeted follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W3090523829,"Yearly increase in influenza activity is associated with cold and dry winter in the temperate regions, while influenza patterns in tropical countries vary significantly by regional climates and geographic locations. To examine the association between influenza activity in Thailand and local climate factors including temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall, we analyzed the influenza surveillance data from January 2010 to December 2018 obtained from a large private hospital in Bangkok. We found that approximately one in five influenza-like illness samples (21.6% or 6,678/30,852) tested positive for influenza virus. Influenza virus typing showed that 34.2% were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 46.0% were influenza A(H3N2), and 19.8% were influenza B virus. There were two seasonal waves of increased influenza activity. Peak influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 activity occurred in February and again in August, while influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses were primarily detected in August and September. Time series analysis suggests that increased relative humidity was significantly associated with increased influenza activity in Bangkok. Months with peak influenza activity generally followed the most humid months of the year. We performed the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) multivariate analysis of all influenza activity on the 2011 to 2017 data to predict the influenza activity for 2018. The resulting model closely resembled the actual observed overall influenza detected that year. Consequently, the ability to predict seasonal pattern of influenza in a large tropical city such as Bangkok may enable better public health planning and underscores the importance of annual influenza vaccination prior to the rainy season."
https://openalex.org/W3090082290,"SCFAs are primarily produced in the colon by bacterial fermentation of nondigestible carbohydrates. Besides providing energy, SCFAs can suppress development of colon cancer. The mechanism, however, remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the SCFA propionate upregulates surface expression of the immune stimulatory NKG2D ligands, MICA/B by imposing metabolic changes in dividing cells. Propionate-mediated MICA/B expression did not rely on GPR41/GPR43 receptors but depended on functional mitochondria. By siRNA-directed knockdown, we could further link phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), the rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis to propionate regulation of MICA/B expression. Moreover, knockdown of Rictor and specific mTOR inhibitors implicated mTORC2 activity with metabolic changes that control MICA/B expression. SCFAs are precursors to short-chain acyl-CoAs that are used for histone acylation thereby linking the metabolic state to chromatin structure and gene expression. Propionate increased the overall acetylation and propionylation and inhibition of lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) that are responsible for adding acyl-CoAs to histones reduced propionate-mediated MICA/B expression, suggesting that propionate-induced acylation increases MICA/B expression. Notably, propionate upregulated MICA/B surface expression on colon cancer cells in an acylation-dependent manner; however, the impact of mitochondrial metabolism on MICA/B expression was different in colon cancer cells compared with Jurkat cells, suggesting that continuous exposure to propionate in the colon may provide an enhanced capacity to metabolize propionate. Together, our findings support that propionate causes metabolic changes resulting in NKG2D ligand surface expression, which holds potential as an immune activating anticancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3091607094,"Background Patients with comorbid conditions have a higher risk of mortality with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection, but the impact on heart failure patients living near a disease hotspot is unknown. Therefore, we sought to characterize the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 in a live registry of heart failure patients across an integrated health care system in Connecticut. Methods In this retrospective analysis, the Yale Heart Failure Registry (NCT04237701) that includes 26,703 patients with heart failure across a 6-hospital integrated health care system in Connecticut was queried on April 16th, 2020 for all patients tested for COVID-19. Sociodemographic and geospatial data as well as, clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality were obtained via the real-time registry. Data on COVID-19 specific care was extracted by retrospective chart review. Results COVID-19 testing was performed on 900 symptomatic patients, comprising 3.4% of the Yale Heart Failure Registry (N = 26,703). Overall, 206 (23%) were COVID- 19+. As compared to COVID-19-, these patients were more likely to be older, black, have hypertension, coronary artery disease, and were less likely to be on renin angiotensin blockers (P<0.05, all). COVID-19- patients tended to be more diffusely spread across the state whereas COVID-19+ were largely clustered around urban centers. 20% of COVID-19+ patients died, and age was associated with increased risk of death [OR 1.92 95% CI (1.33–2.78); P<0.001]. Among COVID-19+ patients who were ≥85 years of age rates of hospitalization were 87%, rates of death 36%, and continuing hospitalization 62% at time of manuscript preparation. Conclusions In this real-world snapshot of COVID-19 infection among a large cohort of heart failure patients, we found that a small proportion had undergone testing. Patients found to be COVID-19+ tended to be black with multiple comorbidities and clustered around lower socioeconomic status communities. Elderly COVID-19+ patients were very likely to be admitted to the hospital and experience high rates of mortality."

We examined methylation differences at CpG island shores in the six genes using Sanger sequencing, and one of two groups of 48 AD patients and 48 elderly controls was used for a test or replication analysis. We found that methylation levels in three out of the six genes, CR1, CLU, and PICALM, were significantly lower in AD subjects. The combination of CLU methylation levels and the APOE genotype classified AD patients with AUC = 0.84 and 0.80 in the test and replication analyses, respectively. Our study implicates methylation differences at the CpG island shores of AD-associated genes in the onset of AD and suggests their diagnostic value."

Men's mean age was 66.76 years. The primary independent variable was Race/Ethnicity (i.e. Black and Hispanic/Latino compared to white males) and covariates included age, education, marital status, insurance status, place of care, and self-rated health.Bivariate manova analyses revealed racial differences across each of the four facets of PCC experience such that non-Hispanic white men reported PC experiences most frequently followed by black then Hispanic/Latino men. Multivariate linear regressions predictive of PCC by race/ethnicity revealed that for Black men, fewer PCC experiences were predicted by discriminatory experiences, reporting fewer chronic conditions and a lack of insurance coverage. For Hispanic/Latino men, access to a provider proved key where not having a place of usual care solely predicted lower PCC frequency.Researchers and health practitioners should continue to explore the impact of inadequate health care coverage, time-limited medical visits and implicit racial bias on medical encounters for underrepresented patients, and to advocate for accessible, inclusive and responsive communication between minority male patients and their health providers."
https://openalex.org/W3091759883,"Knowledge representation has gained in relevance as data from the ubiquitous digitization of behaviors amass and academia and industry seek methods to understand and reason about the information they encode. Success in this pursuit has emerged with data from natural language, where skip-grams and other linear connectionist models of distributed representation have surfaced scrutable relational structures which have also served as artifacts of anthropological interest. Natural language is, however, only a fraction of the big data deluge. Here we show that latent semantic structure can be informed by behavioral data and that domain knowledge can be extracted from this structure through visualization and a novel mapping of the text descriptions of elements onto this behaviorally informed representation. In this study, we use the course enrollment histories of 124,000 students at a public university to learn vector representations of its courses. From these course selection informed representations, a notable 88% of course attribute information was recovered, as well as 40% of course relationships constructed from prior domain knowledge and evaluated by analogy (e.g., Math 1B is to Honors Math 1B as Physics 7B is to Honors Physics 7B). To aid in interpretation of the learned structure, we create a semantic interpolation, translating course vectors to a bag-of-words of their respective catalog descriptions via regression. We find that representations learned from enrollment histories resolved courses to a level of semantic fidelity exceeding that of their catalog descriptions, revealing nuanced content differences between similar courses, as well as accurately describing departments the dataset had no course descriptions for. We end with a discussion of the possible mechanisms by which this semantic structure may be informed and implications for the nascent research and practice of data science."
https://openalex.org/W3090668929,"The relationship between osteoarthritis (OA) structural change and pain is complex. Surgical models of OA in rodents are often rapid in onset, limiting mechanistic utility and translational validity. We aimed to investigate the effect of refining surgical small rodent models of OA on both joint pathology and pain behaviour. Adult male C57BL/6 mice (n = 76, 10–11 weeks of age at time of surgery) underwent either traditional (transection of the medial meniscotibial ligament [MMTL]) or modified (MMTL left intact, transection of the coronary ligaments) DMM surgery, or sham surgery. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 76, weight 175-199g) underwent either modified meniscal transection (MMNX) surgery (transection of the medial meniscus whilst the medial collateral ligament is left intact) or sham surgery. Pain behaviours (weight bearing asymmetry [in mice and rats] and paw withdrawal thresholds [in rats]) were measured pre-surgery and weekly up to 16 weeks post-surgery. Post-mortem knee joints were scored for cartilage damage, synovitis, and osteophyte size. There was a significant increase in weight bearing asymmetry from 13 weeks following traditional, but not modified, DMM surgery when compared to sham operated mice. Both traditional and modified DMM surgery led to similar joint pathology. There was significant pain behaviour from 6 weeks following MMNX model compared to sham operated control rats. Synovitis was significant 4 weeks after MMNX surgery, whereas significant chondropathy was first evident 8 weeks post-surgery, compared to sham controls. Pain behaviour is not always present despite significant changes in medial tibial plateau cartilage damage and synovitis, reflecting the heterogeneity seen in human OA. The development of a slowly progressing surgical model of OA pain in the rat suggests that synovitis precedes pain behaviour and that chondropathy is evident later, providing the foundations for future mechanistic studies into the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3089543581,"Mesangial lesions and podocyte injury are essential manifestations of the progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Although cross-communication between mesangial cells (MCs) and podocytes has recently been suggested by the results of single-nucleus RNA sequencing analyses, the molecular mechanisms and role in disease progression remain elusive. Our cDNA microarray data of diabetic mouse glomeruli suggested the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in DKD pathophysiology. In vitro experiments revealed the suppression of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway and induction of apoptosis in podocytes that were stimulated with the supernatant of MCs cultured in high glucose conditions. In diabetic mice, ERAD inhibition resulted in exacerbated albuminuria, increased apoptosis in podocytes, and reduced nephrin expression associated with the downregulation of ERAD-related biomolecules. Flow cytometry analysis of podocytes isolated from MafB (a transcription factor known to be expressed in macrophages and podocytes)-GFP knock-in mice revealed that ERAD inhibition resulted in decreased nephrin phosphorylation. These findings suggest that an intraglomerular cross talk between MCs and podocytes can inhibit physiological ERAD processes and suppress the phosphorylation of nephrin in podocytes, which thereby lead to podocyte injury under diabetic conditions. Therapeutic intervention of the ERAD pathway through the cross talk between these cells is potentially a novel strategy for DKD."
https://openalex.org/W3090158254,"The purpose of this study was to compare speed, sub-technique selection and temporal patterns between world-class male and female cross-country (XC) skiers and to examine the combined associations of sex and speed on sub-technique selection. Thirty-three XC skiers performed an international 10-km (women; n = 8) and 15-km (men; n = 25) time-trial competition in the classical style (with the first 10 km of the race being used for analyses). An integrated GNSS/IMU system was used to continuously track position speed and automatically classify sub-techniques and temporal patterns (i.e. cycle length and–rate). When comparing the eight highest ranked men and women, men spent less time than women (29±2 vs. 45±5% of total time) using diagonal stride (DIA), more time (44±4 vs. 31±4%) using double poling (DP) and more time (23±2 vs. 19±3%) using tucking and turning (all P < .01). Here, men and women used these sub-techniques at similar temporal patterns within the same speed-intervals; although men employed all sub-techniques at steeper uphill gradients (all P < .05). In subsequent analyses including all 33 skiers, adjustment for average racing speed did not fully attenuate the observed sex differences in the proportion of time using DIA (CI95% [-10.7, -1.6]) and DP (CI95% [0.8, 9.3]). Male world-class XC skiers utilized less DIA and more DP compared to women of equal performance levels. Although these differences coincided with men’s higher speed and their ability to use the various sub-techniques at steeper uphill gradients, sexual dimorphism in the proportional use of DIA and DP also occurred independently of these speed-differences."

What has remained undone until now is the development of a complete, predictive physical model of ChIP-Seq. We show here that by appealing to the physics exploited by ChIP-Seq, a natural framework for quantification, reproducibility, and consistency can be obtained. The standard protocol (10ENCODE Project ConsortiumAn integrated encyclopedia of DNA elements in the human genome.Nature. 2012; 489 (22955616): 5710.1038/nature11247Crossref PubMed Scopus (9820) Google Scholar) does not need to be altered to establish a quantitative scale. Moreover, it becomes apparent that ChIP-Seq data reporting is insufficient for understanding variability and reproducibility. Our analysis shows that a number of common measurements made in every ChIP-Seq experiment should be reported, both because they facilitate understanding reproducibility of experiments and because they are required to determine the inherent scale for quantification. The idea for our approach was to leverage the binding reaction in the immunoprecipitation step of ChIP-Seq to define a physical scale for the sequencing results, allowing comparison of properly designed experiments, and to provide a predictive model for ChIP-Seq outcomes. The quantitative scale for ChIP-Seq arises directly through the existence of the binding isotherm of the IP products. We show example isotherms in Fig. S9. Standard ChIP-Seq involves evaluating only a single point on the isotherm in total neglect of the isotherm generally. Knowledge of the isotherm allows quantitative comparison between ChIP-Seq results for fixed chromatin and different antibody load or fixed antibody load and different chromatin composition (with fixed total chromatin concentration). We focus on the latter in this report. In the siQ-ChIP context, two or more ChIP-Seq results can be quantified and compared by relationship to the isotherm if the axioms of siQ-ChIP are satisfied by the experimental design: 1) ChIP-Seq IPs must be carried out in equal volumes with 2) equal total chromatin concentration and 3) equal antibody load. If the samples being compared present different epitope distributions, then the product of IP reactions (conforming to the above axioms) can be compared on a quantitative scale without modification of the ChIP-Seq protocol. Below, we define the model, make numerical predictions, and report on application to ChIP-Seq experiments. First, note that all sequencing results are the aggregate of sampling the genomes of many cells, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. Cellular heterogeneity implies that in a particular genomic interval, x different cells can present different target densities or may present an off-target that binds to the antibody or an inert off-target that does not bind. Thus, when the cellular chromatin is fragmented and captured noncovalently by antibody binding (Fig. 1b), both target and off-target fragments spanning x are captured, and both types of fragments contribute to the visualized distribution (Fig. 1c). Fig. 1b describes the antibody capture step, immunoprecipitation (IP), as a competitive binding reaction and is subject to the typical mass conservation laws. These are the conservation laws commonly used to determine binding constants by measuring binding isotherms and fitting. Our interpretation of binding constants is consistent with the treatment of polyvalent systems introduced by Mammen et al. (11Mammen M. Choi S.-K. Whitesides G.M. Polyvalent interactions in biological systems: implications for design and use of multivalent ligands and inhibitors.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1998; 37 (10.1002/(SICI)1521-3773(19981102)37:20<2754::AID-ANIE2754>3.0.CO;2-3, 29711117): 2754-2794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as the interaction between chromatin and antibody-bead is of unknown complexity. Application of these laws requires equilibrium, and we report validation of equilibrium for IP in Fig. S8. With the above discussion in mind, we next define everything in the binding model. The total count of fragments with epitope i in interval x rendered from C cells is nit(x)=∑j=1CNij(x). The number of fragments of epitope i in the interval x from cell j is Nij(x), although we never need to determine this parameter for each cell. The total number of fragments with epitope i in the “multi-cell genome” is nit=∑xnit(x). The fraction of the fragments of epitope i at x is oi(x)=nit(x)nit. The “input” sequencing histogram is then given by the proportionality, input(x)∝∑init(x). The “input” is a small-volume aliquot of the chromatin, removed just before the chromatin is reacted with antibody, and is assumed to be a representative sample of all particles present in the intervals x. The IP histogram, which is rendered from the antibody-captured subset of chromatin, is IP(x)∝∑iniboi(x), where nib is the total number of epitope i fragments bound to antibody particles. We express the number of fragments captured on x as the expectation against the distribution oi(x), given the assumption that antibody is unbiased with respect to x. It is always assumed that the antibody is not biased by genomic location, meaning the antibody has no more preference for target fragments from chromosome 1 than it has for target fragments from chromosome 11. As an example, if the antibody bound to a total of 100 epitope i–bearing fragments (nib=100) and only 2% of all i-type fragments are at x (oi(x) = 0.02), then on average 2 of the 100 bound i-type nucleosomes will fall on x, 2=nib×oi(x). Note that nothing has been said about all fragments being mononucleosomal. In the supporting information, we show that the efficiency is computed with fragment length being treated explicitly, allowing for different nucleosome densities to be correctly evaluated. Intuitively, the chromatin field expresses target “enrichment” as the ratio of sequenced IP fragments (or reads) to sequenced input fragments (or reads) in the interval x. Given the formal definitions above, we have the following. ∑iniboi(x)∑init(x)=αIP(x)input(x)=αIP reads at xinput reads at x(Eq. 1) The main results of this work are 1) determination of the proportionality constant α and 2) development of a heuristic model for nib so that we can predict and understand ChIP-Seq outcomes. Equation 1 states that we expect IP(x)∝∑iniboi(x), the mapped fragments at x are proportional to all of the fragments bound in the IP that map to x. There is a similar proportionality expressed for the input. The index i runs over every possible interaction captured by the IP. The lowest affinities are expected to be very noisy and strongly perturbed by washes, where high affinities are expected to be easily maintained. In practice, we collect IP(x) and therefore never specify exactly what all of the values or interpretations of i are. In fact, one of the main challenges in ChIP-Seq is gaining confidence that peaks in the interval x are actually target peaks. This reflects our lack of practical knowledge for what the index i might include. The proportionality constant α is worked out below. Another technical note about Equation 1 in practice before moving on. We make explicit use of paired-end sequencing in siQ-ChIP. One can use all of the tools of siQ-ChIP for single-end workflows by giving all fragments the same length. However, paired-end has the following advantage that is explicitly utilized in siQ-ChIP quantification. To make the most of having measured the length of a mapped fragment, the length being L, we interpret x as the genomic interval on which a mapped fragment starts. Keeping track of all of the mapped lengths allows us to write the siQ-ChIP efficiency as follows. e^(x,L)=αIP(x,L)input(x,L)(Eq. 2) Both the input and IP lengths are explicit in the efficiency. This provides a significant improvement in information content, as one can see how short and long fragments might be differentially captured. Both a visualization of this two-dimensional efficiency and the details of projecting this to one dimension for visualization in a genome browser are given in Fig. S4. In the end, the user controls the size of the interval x on which the efficiency is computed. This interval has a nonnegligible impact if it is chosen too small. Making the interval too small can result in regions where either IP or input contain mapped fragments but not both IP and input. These regions are evaluated to zero in Equation 2. The interval size should be increased iteratively until it is clear that the results no longer depend on the width of interval. This is shown in Fig. S5. The proportionality constant α has not been reported in the literature but is straightforward to deduce. Each of the symbols introduced here can be paired with a step of the ChIP-Seq protocol as illustrated in Fig. 2. To deduce α, consider that one of the sequencing experiments reported herein produced a total of R^=37,298,373 mapped IP reads. These reads were generated by sequencing 20 fmol of library, where the total library mass was 856 fmol. Setting FL=20/856=0.02336 for the fraction of the library that was sequenced, the total number of reads that the full library would generate upon sequencing is R^/FL, or 1.5 billion for this experiment. The library was amplified with c = 11 cycles of PCR, so this estimate of the total reads must be reduced by the appropriate number of amplifications, lowering the estimate of total reads to its preamplification value, R^/FL/2c. 3If the efficiency ϵ is a known function of sequence x, then amplification can be more accurately accounted for with 1+ϵ(x). Because ϵ is not usually known, we take the typical assumption, 1+ϵ(x)≈2. The library was captured on KAPA Pure beads, producing an additional material loss, ρ. ρ is the ratio of captured library concentration to the expected library concentration. 4The average base pair has a molar mass of 660 g/mol. 300-bp fragments are then expected at 198,000 g/mol. If 10 ng of 300-bp-long DNA are amplified by 211 and suspended in 20 μl (our library volume), the expected concentration is 5.17 μm. ρ is the ratio of actual library concentration to the estimated 5.17 μm. In practice, the empirical library averaged fragment length must be used to determine ρ. Thus, average fragment length is an input parameter for the software associated with this work. This coefficient compensates for losses due to bead capture and washing and, to some extent, for global deviations from the perfect 2c amplification. The estimated number of possible reads becomes R^/FL/2c/ρ. The observed read count (R^) has been scaled up by each known source of material loss and down-sampling. The IP produced 24.2 ng of material, but only 10 ng were used to produce the library, so, where F=0.413 is the fraction of IP material carried into the library, the total fragments generated by sequencing all of the DNA collected by IP are as follows. R=R^FL 2c ρ F(Eq. 3) Thus, 226 million reads could be extracted from the IP material if all of the material were sequenced. The total sequenced fragments have been scaled to match the total collected fragments, ∑x∑iniboi(x). An analogous scaling also applies to the input sample. The constant α is defined as the ratio of these factors, α=ρinρFinLFLFinF(Eq. 4) where the subscript in refers to the analogous measurements taken on the input sample. Having established Equations 1, 2, and 4, we have established the requirements for a quantitative ChIP-Seq. (We are assuming that every sequencer is subject to a central limit theorem, which seems implicit in the way sequencing results are currently used. Sequencing results are expected to be reproducible and subject to standard practices for determining means and variances.) One can go one step further now by establishing a predictive heuristic model for the bound particles (or fragments), nib. Any fragments captured by IP are captured because their free energy of binding to the IP beads is sufficiently negative. We take “sufficient” to mean that the interaction survives washes and generates DNA for library preparation. Without specifying any details about what the microscopic state of any of these interactions is, we can associate with each a macroscopic binding constant, KB,i. This association allows us to specify the following predictive model for understanding ChIP-Seq outcomes. For any species of epitope i, we can write the total concentration in the IP volume as Sit. This corresponds to the above definitions as nit=(V−vin) NA Sit, where V−vin is the IP volume, and NA is Avogadro's number. Thus, chromatin was suspended in a total volume V, and then an input aliquot of volume vin was removed prior to reaction with antibody. The concentration of any bound species can be stated as the difference between total and unbound concentrations, giving us Sib=Sit−Sif. Relating back to the definitions above, nib=(V−vin) NA Sib. Using these definitions and α, Equation 1 can now be recast in terms of epitope concentrations in the IP. e^(x)=αvin(V−vin)IP reads at xinput reads at x=∑iSiboi(x)∑iSit(x)=∑iSit(ABfKB,i1+ABfKB,i)oi(x)∑iSit(x)(Eq. 5) From here on, we include the volume factor in the definition of α. We noted above that one should expect the proportionality IP(x)∝∑iniboi(x). In Equation 5, we have written nib as (V−vin) NA Sib, which connects the expected outcome of the ChIP-Seq experiment to the binding reaction in IP. The last line of Equation 5 rewrites Sib as the formal solution to the mass conservation laws in Fig. 1b. Details are given in the supporting information. ABf is the free antibody concentration, determined as the solution to the conservation laws. The bound concentration of each epitope will follow a sigmoidal shape given by y/(1+y), where y=ABfKB,i. KB,i is the binding constant for epitope i, in the sense of Ref. 11Mammen M. Choi S.-K. Whitesides G.M. Polyvalent interactions in biological systems: implications for design and use of multivalent ligands and inhibitors.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1998; 37 (10.1002/(SICI)1521-3773(19981102)37:20<2754::AID-ANIE2754>3.0.CO;2-3, 29711117): 2754-2794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. We note that the above results apply also to sequencing experiments where spike-ins were used. The “genome” in that case is simply understood as the host genome appended with the spike-in DNA so that certain intervals x correspond only to spike-in sequences. In this section, we present simulated outcomes from Equation 5 to make every aspect of the model concrete. The first step of ChIP-Seq is the IP, so this section first covers solutions to the mass conservation equations of Fig. 1b to elucidate the composition of bound fragments in the IP for different reaction conditions. The empirical data presented below pertain to ChIP-Seq outcomes in the case of epitope depletion. In that paradigm, a histone PTM, H3K27me3, is depleted by culturing cells in the presence of an inhibitor of the enzyme (EZH2) responsible for chemical addition of the PTM. We will demonstrate below that applying standard ChIP-Seq to a depleted and control sample results in counterintuitive changes in sequencing peaks, where the depleted sample may present larger peaks than the control sample (see Fig. 4a). No doubt, such observations underlie the broad claims that ChIP-Seq is not quantitative on its own. A quantitative ChIP-Seq would eliminate physically inconsistent outcomes and allow direct comparison of capture efficiency on genomic intervals. We note that an interactive form of the following numerical demonstration is available at the author's web page (www.proteinknowledge.com/siqD3). To understand possible outcome scenarios for a depletion experiment, we solved the mass conservation laws in Fig. 1b for a four-species system in two physically possible cases. Generally, it is unknown how the chromatin landscape will respond to the use of an inhibitor, so we solved the model for the following scenarios. Case 1 (Fig. 3a) models a system in which epitope is replaced with inert fragments. These fragments do not interact with antibody. Case 2 (Fig. 3b) models a system in which epitope is replaced with off-target fragments, causing a net increase in concentration for that off-target PTM. Both cases always present equal total chromatin and antibody concentrations in the IP reaction. Equal chromatin and antibody loading of the IP are the only constraints of siQ-ChIP. To the greatest extent possible, variation in ChIP-Seq outcomes is isolated to perturbation-induced changes in chromatin epitope distribution when this constraint is met. We do not know binding constants for antibodies, so the simulation assumes that the antibody is 100-fold selective for target S1t over the off-target S2t and 22-fold selective over the remaining off-target S3t. Here “selective” is taken as ratios of binding constants. Full details are given in the legend to Fig. 3. Even without exact knowledge of these parameters, this heuristic model allows us to gain intuition for ChIP-Seq outcomes and to make testable predictions for comparison with experiments. Fig. 3 summarizes IP reactions across a range of conditions. Any single experimental outcome would correspond to a single vertical slice of the graphs. Simulation results in Fig. 3 are plotted as a function of target concentration (S1t) and display how the composition of sequencing reads is predicted to change in response to epitope depletion. Epitope depletion is read from Fig. 3 by moving leftward along the x axis. Importantly, the left-side y axis is a percentage, allowing us to plot both the percent composition of bound fragments and the percent efficiency of capture for each species. These are two distinct quantities, and the ChIP-Seq field has so far only considered the capture efficiency because it is easily reflected by spike-in capture efficiency. The key distinction to be aware of is that capture efficiency reflects the fraction (or percent) of a given species that is captured. The fractional composition (or percent composition) reflects how much of the sequenced fragments arise from each species captured in IP. The composition cannot be determined from capture efficiency of spike-ins, but the field has overlooked this reality so far. In Fig. 3 we have plotted spike-in capture efficiency as red lines (solid or dashed), and we have plotted the fractional composition in solid lines (shades of purple for off-target and gold for on-target). There are a few key observations to be made from the results in Fig. 3, which are true of both simulated cases. First, target depletion results in an increase in the number of off-target reads. This is seen by looking at the fractional composition of the IP products, shown in shades of purple (off-target) and gold (target). As target epitope is depleted (moving from right to left in Fig. 3), the fractional composition of target decreases as expected. However, the fractional composition of off-targets increases. So whereas epitope depletion may result in decreasing IP mass, the fraction of that captured mass that belongs to off-target epitope is increasing. Second, and in stark contrast to the fractional composition, all species capture efficiencies increase when target concentration is decreased. The simulated spike-in efficiencies are plotted with red lines in Fig. 3. Both target and off-target capture efficiencies increase when the amount of target presented by chromatin is decreased. This is intuitive. The amount of target presented by chromatin is reduced by depletion, leaving more antibody to interact with spike-in. Fig. 3 simulates the spike-in consistent with the ICeChIP method (6Grzybowski A.T. Chen Z. Ruthenburg A.J.

Because these spike-ins are presented in small amounts, the antibody easily saturates them after target depletion, leading to an increase in capture efficiency. Remember, the capture efficiency simply reports the fraction of each labeled species that is captured in the IP. Spike-in capture efficiency and unlabeled chromatin capture efficiency are inversely related, yet the spike-in recipe is to normalize to the capture efficiency for target spike-in. Third, as a corollary to the second observation, spike-in capture will saturate at conditions different from saturation conditions for the unlabeled chromatin. Fig. 3 shows that a large range of IP conditions produce constant spike-in capture efficiency even though the fractional composition of the IP is changing. This means that whereas more and more of the IP product is due to off-target interactions, the spike-ins do not change. Spike-ins are blind to this contamination. A Drosophila spike-in may improve sensitivity here (because epitope signals are not separable) but still runs the same risk, especially when the limits of sensitivity for a given IP are not defined. For example, the percentage of on-target reads, or fragments, varies from 90% down to less than 10% in case 1 of Fig. 3 (gold line), whereas the spike-in efficiency only ranges from 90 to 98% for the same experimental conditions. The spike-in capture efficiency is not sensitive to experimental conditions for most of the conditions shown in Fig. 3. Normalizing to spike-ins in these limits would not produce a quantitative scale; the scale would be invariant to the changing amount of target epitope. This limit of invariance can be achieved if antibody is in excess of target and may thus be encountered for tightly distributed PTMs like H3K4me3 (12Shah R.N. Grzybowski A.T. Cornett E.M.

A comprehensive numerical simulation is performed to predict the airflow pattern and thermal behavior in different arched greenhouses. The defined arc chord angle and position angle are employed to examine the natural ventilation process and corresponding roof vent scenarios. The numerical simulation is compared with the experimental data and good agreements are observed. Various configurations of ventilated structures, wind conditions and ventilation layouts are simulated on a high-resolution polyhedral grid based on a grid sensitivity analysis, which is beneficial to the optimization of greenhouse cooling combined with the water circulation heat collection system. The cooling effect in summer is analyzed by estimating the ventilation flow rate and microclimate inhomogeneity. The results demonstrate that the position angle of 85° of the arched greenhouses is an optimum ventilation direction and its impact on the microclimate is marginally affected by the change of the ventilation structure. The designed ventilation scheme has perfect air exchange capacity and cooling effect because the average air temperature can be reduced by 1.5°C more than the existing greenhouse in 10 minutes of ventilation. Likewise, the results show that the temperature and velocity inhomogeneities are approximately decreased by 33.3% and 11.89%, respectively. The practical value of the research is expected to provide basic quantitative conclusions for evaluating the natural ventilation performance."

Our previous studies have demonstrated that TGF-β1 is a potent inhibitor of luteinization in human granulosa-lutein (hGL) cells. Whether TGF-β1 can regulate the expression of COL1A1 during the luteal phase remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of TGF-β1 on the regulation of COL1A1 expression and the underlying molecular mechanisms using an immortalized hGL cell line (SVOG cells) and primary hGL cells (obtained from 20 consenting patients undergoing IVF treatment). The results showed that TGF-β1 significantly upregulated the expression of COL1A1. Using inhibition approaches, including pharmacological inhibition (a specific p38 inhibitor, SB203580, and a specific ERK1/2 inhibitor, U0126) and specific siRNA-mediated knockdown inhibition, we demonstrated that TGF-β1 promoted the expression and production of COL1A1 in hGL cells, most likely via the ALK5-mediated p38 signaling pathway. Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which TGF-β1 promotes the deposition of type I collagen during the late follicular phase in humans."

When the first cough was evoked or if it remained absent for 30 seconds (indicating an abnormal result), the test was ended. Patients also completed the repetitive saliva swallowing test (RSST) and modified water swallowing test. We monitored patients for pneumonia signs for 30 days post-admission. Eighteen patients exhibited an abnormal simplified cough test result. On multivariate analysis, an abnormal RSST result was independently associated with an abnormal simplified cough test result. Seventeen patients developed pneumonia. The adjusted Cox proportional hazard model for pneumonia onset revealed that the simplified cough test had predictive power for pneumonia onset (hazard ratio, 10.52; 95% confidence interval, 3.72–29.72). The simplified cough test is a strong indicator for predicting the pneumonia development in patients with acute stroke; it should be added to existing bedside screening tests for predicting pneumonia risk, allowing appropriate and timely intervention."

Previously, we reported that Olfactomedin-like 3 (Olfml3) is a matricellular protein with proangiogenic properties. Here, we explored the role of Olfml3 in a knockout mouse model engineered to suppress this protein. The mutant mice exhibited vascular defects in pericyte coverage, suggesting that pericytes influence blood vessel formation in an Olfml3-dependent manner. Olfml3-deficient mice exhibited abnormalities in the vasculature causing partial lethality of embryos and neonates. Reduced pericyte coverage was observed at embryonic day 12.5 and persisted throughout development, resulting in perinatal death of 35% of Olfml3-deficient mice. Cultured Olfml3-deficient pericytes exhibited aberrant motility and altered pericyte association to endothelial cells. Furthermore, the proliferative response of Olfml3-/- pericytes upon PDGF-B stimulation was significantly diminished. Subsequent experiments revealed that intact PDGF-B signaling, mediated via Olfml3 binding, is required for pericyte proliferation and activation of downstream kinase pathways. Our findings suggest a model wherein pericyte recruitment to endothelial cells requires Olfml3 to provide early instructive cue and retain PDGF-B along newly formed vessels to achieve optimal angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3090707925,"Introduction Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-responsive element-binding protein H (CREBH), an endoplasmic reticulum-anchored transcription factor essential for lipid metabolism and inflammation in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is covalently modified by N-acetylglucosamine. Glycosylation is a ubiquitous type of protein involved in posttranslational modifications, and plays a critical role in various biological processes. However, the mechanism of glycosylated CREBH remains poorly understood in NAFLD. Methods CREBH glycosylation mutants were obtained by site-mutation methods. After transfection with plasmids, AML-12, LO2, or HepG2 cells were treated with palmitic acid (PA) proteolysis, tunicamycin (Tm), or their combination. Glycosyltransferase V (GnT-V) was used induce hyperglycosylation to further understand the effect of CREBH. In addition, glycosylation mutant mice and hyperglycosylated mice were generated by lentivirus injection to construct two kinds of NAFLD animal models. The expression of NAFLD-related factors was detected to further verify the role of N-linked glycosylation of CREBH in lipid and sterol metabolism, inflammation, and lipotoxicity. Results N-glycosylation enhanced the ability of CREBH to activate transcription and modulated the production of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) activity by affecting their promoter-driven transcription activity and protein interactions, leading to reduce lipid deposition and attenuate lipotoxicity. Deglycosylation of CREBH induced by Tm could inhibit the proteolysis of CREBH induced by PA. The addition of unglycosylated CREBH to cells upregulates gene and protein expression of lipogenesis, lipotoxicity, and inflammation, and aggravates liver damage by preventing glycosylation in cells, as well as in mouse models of NAFLD. Furthermore, increased N-glycosylation of CREBH, as achieved by overexpressing GnT-V could significantly improve liver lesion caused by unglycosylation of CREBH. Conclusion These findings have important implications for the role of CREBH N-glycosylation in proteolytic activation, and they provide the first link between N-glycosylation of CREBH, lipid metabolism, and lipotoxicity processes in the liver by modulating PPARα and SCD-1. These results provide novel insights into the N-glycosylation of CREBH as a therapeutic target for NAFLD."

Methods Eighty-four patients with unilateral idiopathic ERM were involved. Patients were categorized into: Group 1, ERM without membrane contraction; Group 2, ERM with membrane contraction and retinal folding; and Group 3, ERM with membrane contraction and macular edema. Twenty-two patients received surgical removal of ERM. Choroidal thickness was compared between ERM and fellow eyes, and before and after treatment. Results Mean choroidal thickness was significantly greater in ERM eyes than in fellow eyes (234.4 ± 22.5 vs 220.6 ± 20.8 μm; P<0.01). Group 1 (n = 20) showed no significant difference in choroidal thickness between ERM and fellow eyes. Eyes in Group 2 (n = 27) and Group 3 (n = 37) showed statistically significant differences in mean choroidal thickness between ERM and fellow eyes (229.6 ± 23.8 vs 220.8 ± 19.6 μm; 242.6 ± 27.8 vs 221.0 ± 21.8 μm, respectively; P<0.05). In Group 2 (n = 8) and Group 3 (n = 16), choroidal thickness in ERM eyes decreased significantly at 1 month and 6 months after surgery, compared with that before surgery (P<0.05 for all comparisons). Conclusions Membrane contraction contributed to the increase in choroidal thickness in idiopathic ERM patients. This finding may help to elucidate the pathophysiologic features of idiopathic ERM as well as the response to treatment in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W3091176621,"The Hippo pathway plays an important role in developmental biology, mediating organ size by controlling cell proliferation through the activity of a core kinase cassette. Multiple upstream events activate the pathway, but how each controls this core kinase cassette is not fully understood. Activation of the core kinase cassette begins with phosphorylation of the kinase MST1/2 (also known as STK3/4). Here, using a combination of in vitro biochemistry and cell-based assays, including chemically induced dimerization and single-molecule pulldown, we revealed that increasing the proximity of adjacent kinase domains, rather than formation of a specific protein assembly, is sufficient to trigger autophosphorylation. We validate this mechanism in cells and demonstrate that multiple events associated with the active pathway, including SARAH domain–mediated homodimerization, membrane recruitment, and complex formation with the effector protein SAV1, each increase the kinase domain proximity and autophosphorylation of MST2. Together, our results reveal that multiple and distinct upstream signals each utilize the same common molecular mechanism to stimulate MST2 autophosphorylation. This mechanism is likely conserved among MST2 homologs. Our work also highlights potential differences in Hippo signal propagation between each activating event owing to differences in the dynamics and regulation of each protein ensemble that triggers MST2 autophosphorylation and possible redundancy in activation.

When the Hippo pathway is inactive, YAP/TAZ translocate to the nucleus and form a transcriptionally competent complex with TEAD. When the pathway is active, YAP/TAZ are phosphorylated, sequestered in the cytoplasm, and degraded. At the heart of the Hippo pathway is a core kinase cassette that includes two kinases that each have two isoforms, MST1/2 (also known as STK3/4 in mammals or Hippo in flies) and LATS1/2 (Warts in flies), and two effector proteins, SAV1 (Salvador in flies) and Mob1 (Mats in flies), which stimulate the activity of each kinase, respectively (Fig. 1A). During signal transduction, an activated MST1/2 phosphorylates and activates Lats1/2, and an active Lats1/2 phosphorylates YAP/TAZ (27Chan E.H.Y. Nousiainen M. Chalamalasetty R.B. Schäfer A.

https://openalex.org/W3090293698,"Background Nodding syndrome (NS), is an unexplained form of epilepsy which leads to stunted growth, cognitive decline, and a characteristic nodding of the head. Current data about its impact on households in Uganda is scarce. Therefore, this study aims to assess the economic burden of the persistent morbidity of NS on caregivers in affected households in Northern Uganda. Methods A cross-sectional cost-of-care study was conducted from January 2019 to February 2019 in Lakwela village-Northern Uganda in 14 households, who are members of a community-based organization (CBO) established in the village with the support of a Japanese research team, (Uganda-Japan Nodding Syndrome Network). Data was collected through questionnaires. Both direct (medical and non-medical) and indirect (informal care) costs of caregiving were assessed. Indirect costs were valued using the human-capital method as loss of production. Results Direct costs constituted a higher proportion of costs for NS households, accounting for on average 7.7% of household expenditure. The annual weighted mean cost per NS patient was estimated at 27.6 USD (26.4 USD direct costs, 96.2% and 1.2 USD indirect cost, 3.8%). Average time spent on informal caregiving was 4.4 ±1.7 (standard deviation) hours/week with an estimated annual informal caregiving cost of 24.85 USD and gross domestic product (GDP) loss of 412.40 USD. Conclusion Direct costs due to NS are still high among households in this study. More studies are needed to investigate measures that could help bring down these costs and equally reduce the day-to-day disruption of caregiver’s activities; consequently, improving the lives of these affected households and communities."
https://openalex.org/W3089940525,"Regulatory elements (REs) consist of enhancers and promoters that occupy a significant portion of the noncoding genome and control gene expression programs either in cis or in trans. Putative REs have been identified largely based on their regulatory features (co-occupancy of ESC-specific transcription factors, enhancer histone marks, and DNase hypersensitivity) in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). However, less has been established regarding their regulatory functions in their native context. We deployed cis- and trans-regulatory elements scanning through saturating mutagenesis and sequencing (ctSCAN-SMS) to target elements within the ∼12-kb cis-region (cis-REs; CREs) of the Oct4 gene locus, as well as genome-wide 2,613 high-confidence trans-REs (TREs), in mESCs. ctSCAN-SMS identified 10 CREs and 12 TREs as novel candidate REs of the Oct4 gene in mESCs. Furthermore, deletions of these candidate REs confirmed that the majority of the REs are functionally active, and CREs are more active than TREs in controlling Oct4 gene expression. A subset of active CREs and TREs physically interact with the Oct4 promoter to varying degrees; specifically, a greater number of active CREs, compared with active TREs, physically interact with the Oct4 promoter. Moreover, comparative genomics analysis reveals that a greater number of active CREs than active TREs are evolutionarily conserved between mice and primates, including humans. Taken together, our study demonstrates the reliability and robustness of ctSCAN-SMS screening to identify critical REs and investigate their roles in the regulation of transcriptional output of a target gene (in this case Oct4) in their native context.

Prior screens to identify functional CREs were focused on either targeting putative CREs of gene(s) of interest (gene-centric) or targeting putative CREs bound by selected TFs (TF-centric). Nevertheless, identification of functional TREs presents a challenge that has attracted less attention. Here, we deployed genome-wide cis- and trans-regulatory elements scanning through saturating mutagenesis and sequencing (ctSCAN-SMS) in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to identify critical CREs and TREs of the Pou5f1/Oct4 gene (a master pluripotency regulator of mESCs). We uncovered new functionally active CREs and TREs and how they regulate Pou5f1/Oct4 gene expression in mESCs. In mESCs, several putative REs, including 8,563 enhancers (ENs) and 231 superenhancers (SEs) have been identified based on co-occupancy of ESC-specific TFs (OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, KLF4, and ESRRB), mediators (MED1), enhancer histone marks (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac), and DNase I hypersensitivity (30Whyte W.A.

Master transcription factors and mediator establish super-enhancers at key cell identity genes.Cell. 2013; 153 (23582322): 307-31910.1016/j.cell.2013.03.035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). SEs contain multiple ENs; SEs are also more densely co-occupied with TFs, enhancer histone marks, and chromatin regulators, as compared with ENs, and associate with greater transcriptional output (30Whyte W.A. Orlando D.A. Hnisz D. Abraham B.J. Lin C.Y. Kagey M.H. Rahl P.B. Lee T.I. Young R.A. Master transcription factors and mediator establish super-enhancers at key cell identity genes.Cell. 2013; 153 (23582322): 307-31910.1016/j.cell.2013.03.035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). We undertook a high-throughput CRISPR-Cas9–mediated genome-editing approach to comprehensively target putative REs in mESCs. First, we generated a genome-wide map of open chromatin regions using ATAC-Seq in mESCs, as ATAC-Seq identifies most EN REs (10Buenrostro J.D. Giresi P.G. Zaba L.C. Chang H.Y. Greenleaf W.J. Transposition of native chromatin for fast and sensitive epigenomic profiling of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins and nucleosome position.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 (24097267): 1213-121810.1038/nmeth.2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2509) Google Scholar). ATAC-Seq peaks were then overlaid within all putative ENs (8,563) and SEs (231) to designate “high-confidence” REs (2,613) (Fig. 1a, Fig. S1a, and Table S1). As these REs are distributed genome-wide and on different chromosomes relative to the Oct4 gene locus (in trans), we termed these REs TREs. All possible single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) (20 nt) were designed (within the TREs for tilling) upstream of the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 NGG-protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequences to target the high-confidence 2,613 TREs (Fig. 1a, Fig. S1a, and Tables S1 and S2). This analysis yielded 70,480 sgRNAs with a median gap of 5 bp between adjacent genomic cleavages (Fig. 1, c and d). Likewise, 1,827 sgRNAs were designed at the surrounding ∼12-kb (−10 to +2 kb of the TSS of the Oct4) region of the mouse Oct4 gene locus to dissect the CREs of Oct4 (Fig. 1, b and c). In addition, the library included 2,000 nontargeting (NT) sgRNAs as negative controls, 119 sgRNAs targeting GFP (of the Oct4-GFP reporter that used for the screen), and 150 sgRNAs targeting coding sequence of mESC-TFs as positive controls (Fig. 1c). In total, the RE CRISPR-Cas9 pooled library contained 74,576 sgRNAs (Fig. 1c). These sgRNAs were synthesized, pooled, and cloned into a lentiviral vector for deep sequencing. The deep sequencing of the pooled library confirmed the presence of >95% sgRNAs that target TREs and >99% sgRNAs that target CREs and control sgRNAs (Fig. S1 (b–f) and Table S2). The pooled library was transduced into an Oct4-GFP reporter mESC line, which constitutively expresses Cas9 (31Yeom Y.I. Fuhrmann G. Ovitt C.E. Brehm A. Ohbo K. Gross M. Hübner K. Schöler H.R.

The Oct4-GFP reporter was used as a “readout” for the screen to measure the reduction in GFP levels upon perturbation of any targeted RE regions by their corresponding sgRNAs. Lentiviral transduction of the pooled library was performed at low multiplicity (MOI) to ensure that each cell contained predominantly one sgRNA (Fig. S2a). After puromycin drug selection (because sgRNA constructs carry the puromycin drug resistance gene), “GFP-low” cells were sorted using FACS (Fig. S2, a and b). As a control, cells were collected before FACS (the “pre-sort” sample). Genomic DNA was isolated from both “GFP-low” and “pre-sort” cell populations, and next-generation sequencing was employed to enumerate the sgRNAs in each population (Fig. S2a). The screen was performed in triplicate. We calculated an “enrichment score” of each sgRNA by comparing its frequency (presence) in GFP-low over pre-sort cells. Enrichment scores were determined based on the two best replicates (Table S2). The highest and lowest enrichment scores obtained from GFP-targeting sgRNAs (mean log2FC 4.87, p < 0.0001) and NT sgRNAs (mean log2FC 0.44, p < 0.0001) indicated that the screen was technically successful (Fig. 2a and 3a). We ranked all sgRNAs based on their enrichment scores (Table S2) and analyzed their off-target scores (ranging between 0 and 100) (34Hsu P.D. Scott D.A. Weinstein J.A. Ran F.A. Konermann S.

A higher off-target score signifies fewer off-targets of an sgRNA. We found that the majority of the evaluated sgRNAs (87.6% sgRNAs for CREs and 84.5% sgRNAs for TREs) had off-target scores >10 (Table S2); these sgRNAs are statistically significant based on the hidden Markov model (HMM) analysis (Fig. S3a).Figure 3Identification and validation of active TREs of the Oct4 gene. a, dot plot analysis displays the enrichment score of each sgRNAs by comparing its frequency in the GFP-low cells with that in the pre-sort cells at the selected candidate 12 TREs. b, list of identified candidate TREs of the Oct4 gene. c, binding dynamics of OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, H3K27ac, and H3K4me1 represented within the TREs of Oct4. d, ATAC-Seq demonstrates the changes in open chromatin regions/ENs from undifferentiated to differentiated mESC state (0, 8, 24, and 96 h) within the TREs. e, quantitative RT-PCR data illustrate the mRNA expression changes of endogenous Oct4 upon deletion of individual TREs of Oct4.

This yielded 16 candidate CREs (numbered 1–16), based on the mean enrichment score (mean log2FC) of sgRNAs per CRE. Each of the candidate CREs had a mean log2FC > 0.5 (range of mean log2FC 0.93–3.95), with p < 0.0001, which was higher than the mean enrichment score of NT sgRNAs (mean log2FC 0.44, with p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2, a and b). Among 16 CREs, CREs 10 and 12 have been recognized previously as distal and proximal enhancers, respectively (31Yeom Y.I. Fuhrmann G. Ovitt C.E. Brehm A. Ohbo K. Gross M. Hübner K. Schöler H.R. Germline regulatory element of Oct-4 specific for the totipotent cycle of embryonal cells.Development. 1996; 122 (8631266): 881-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); CREs 13–16 were present within the promoter region of Oct4 (±2 kb of TSS) (31Yeom Y.I. Fuhrmann G. Ovitt C.E. Brehm A. Ohbo K. Gross M. Hübner K. Schöler H.R. Germline regulatory element of Oct-4 specific for the totipotent cycle of embryonal cells.Development. 1996; 122 (8631266): 881-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining 10 CREs were newly identified candidate CREs of the Oct4 gene (Fig. 2, a and b). Of note, CRE 12 displayed a relatively lower mean enrichment score (log2FC 0.77, p < 0.0001) compared with other candidate CREs, because the original Oct4-GFP reporter lacks a portion of CRE 12 (33Szabó P.E. Hübner K. Schöler H. Mann J.R. Allele-specific expression of imprinted genes in mouse migratory primordial germ cells.Mech. Dev. 2002; 115 (12049782): 157-16010.1016/S0925-4773(02)00087-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, we included CRE 12 for further validation. To classify the candidate TREs, we applied a statistically relevant HMM analysis to the sgRNA enrichment scores (35Canver M.C. Lessard S. Pinello L. Wu Y. Ilboudo Y. Stern E.N. Needleman A.J. Galactéros F. Brugnara C. Kutlar A. McKenzie C. Reid M. Chen D.D. Das P.P. Cole M.A. et al.Variant-aware saturating mutagenesis using multiple Cas9 nucleases identifies regulatory elements at trait-associated loci.Nature. 2017; 49 (28218758): 625-63410.1038/ng.3793Google Scholar), which initially identified 263 candidate TREs. Furthermore, we applied stringent criteria to select candidate TREs for validation, as follows: (i) TREs must have HMM sgRNAs with off-target scores >10 (Fig. 3a and Fig. S4a); (ii) TREs must possess at least four sgRNAs with mean log2FC >0.5 (range of mean log2FC 0.86–2.52), with p < 0.0001 (Fig. 3b); (iii) TREs must co-occupy with ESC-TFs (OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2) and enhancer histone marks (H3K27ac and H3K4me1) (Fig. 3c and Fig. S4b); and (iv) they must contain “dynamic” open chromatin regions (i.e. “open” chromatin regions present in the undifferentiated state (0 h) that gradually become “closed” with differentiation (24 and 96 h) of mESCs) (Fig. 3d and Fig. S4c). Based on these criteria, we selected 12 candidate TREs of the Oct4 gene (Fig. 3, a and b). We selected a total of 33 REs, including 20 CREs (16 candidate CREs and 4 control CREs (CREs with no significant enrichment scores of sgRNAs)) and 13 TREs (12 candidate TREs and one control TRE (with no significant enrichment scores of sgRNAs)) of the Oct4 gene locus for validation using WT mESCs. “Paired” sgRNAs (5′ and 3′ sgRNAs) tagged with mCherry were used to target both of the flanking ends of each selected candidate RE to create a deletion. Following transfection of paired sgRNAs-mCherry into the WT mESCs, mCherry-positive cells were sorted to measure the endogenous Oct4 mRNA expression and to confirm the genomic deletions of CREs/TREs (Figs. 2f and 3e, Figs. S3d and S4e, and Table S3). We observed a significant reduction in Oct4 expression to different extents upon deletions of CREs 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, and 13–16 (of 16 candidate CREs) (Fig. 2f). Deletions of newly identified CREs 1, 3, 5, and 7 showed a greater reduction in Oct4 expression, compared with deletions of known distal and proximal enhancers (CREs 10 and 12) of Oct4 (Fig. 2f). However, “regulatory features,” such as co-occupancy of ESC-TFs (OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2–ONS), enhancer histone marks (H3K27ac and H3K4me1), and dynamic open chromatin regions (ATAC-Seq peaks at 0 h compared with 24, 96 h), were more prominent at CREs 7, 10, and 12 compared with CREs 1, 3, and 5 (Fig. 2 (c–e) and Fig. S3 (b and c)). Moreover, deletions of CREs 13–16 (present at the promoter region of Oct4) showed a significant reduction in Oct4 expression, as expected (Fig. 2f). Nonetheless, only CREs 13 and 14 showed substantial co-occupancy of ONS, H3K27ac, and dynamic open chromatin regions, as compared with other CREs present at the Oct4 promoter (Fig. 2 (c–e) and Fig. S3 (b and c)). In contrast, deletions of control CREs (C1–C4) led to no significant changes in Oct4 expression (Fig. 2f). Additionally, control CREs exhibited low-level co-occupancy of ONS, H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and dynamic open chromatin regions (Fig. 2 (d and e) and Fig. S3 (b and c)). These data confirm the existence of multiple “active” CREs (active REs depict REs that reduce the Oct4 expression upon their deletions), including newly identified active CREs of the Oct4. Yet some active CREs fail to display recognized regulatory features (i.e. without of any co-occupancy of TFs, enhancer histone marks, and open chromatin regions), as described recently (26Rajagopal N. Srinivasan S. Kooshesh K. Guo Y. Edwards M.D. Banerjee B. Syed T. Emons B.J.M. Gifford D.K. Sherwood R.I. High-throughput mapping of regulatory DNA.Nat.

Methods. 2017; 14 (28417999): 629-63510.1038/nmeth.4264Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), suggesting that a subset of functionally active REs may lack typical regulatory features. Deletions of eight TREs (TREs 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 12) of 12 candidates showed a significant reduction in Oct4 expression to various extents (Fig. 3e). Nonetheless, all 12 TREs were co-occupied with ONS, H3K27ac, and H3K4me1 enhancer marks and exhibited dynamic open chromatin regions (Fig. 3 (c and d) and Fig. S4 (b and c)), as all of the candidate TREs (TREs 1–12) were short-listed for validation based on their regulatory features. Conversely, control TREs lack typical regulatory features (Fig. 3, c and d), and deletion did not affect Oct4 expression (Fig. 3e). Moreover, neighboring genes of most of the validated active TREs were lowly expressed in mESCs (Fig. S4d), indicating that these genes may not be critical for mESC state maintenance. Importantly, we observed that the reduction of Oct4 expression was greater for the majority of active CREs than active TREs upon their deletions (Figs. 2f and 3e). This suggests that CREs generally contribute more than TREs to control overall Oct4 gene expression. Taken together, these data demonstrate the reliability and robustness of the ctSCAN-SMS screen to identify new candidate REs of the Oct4 in a high-throughput manner. Moreover, we confirm that a subset of these newly identified candidate CREs and TREs are functionally active REs of the Oct4 gene, and CREs are more active compared with TREs. REs (particularly enhancers) physically interact with gene promoters and control transcription (36Murakawa Y. Yoshihara M. Kawaji H. Nishikawa M. Zayed H. Suzuki H. Hayashizaki Y.

These stresses are believed to be decisive for the plaque vulnerability but all applied models suffer from inaccuracy of input data, especially when obtained in vivo only. One hundred computational models based on ex vivo MRI are used to investigate the impact of wall thickness, MRI slice thickness, lipid core and fibrous tissue stiffness, and media anisotropy on the calculated peak plaque and peak cap stresses. The investigated factors are taken as continuous in the range based on published experimental results, only the impact of anisotropy is evaluated by comparison with a corresponding isotropic model. Design of Experiment concept is applied to assess the statistical significance of these investigated factors representing uncertainties in the input data of the model. The results show that consideration of realistic properties of arterial wall in the model is decisive for the stress evaluation; assignment of properties of fibrous tissue even to media and adventitia layers as done in some studies may induce up to eightfold overestimation of peak stress. The impact of MRI slice thickness may play a key role when local thin fibrous cap is present. Anisotropy of media layer is insignificant, and the stiffness of fibrous tissue and lipid core may become significant in some combinations."
https://openalex.org/W3090623771,"The Southwest Pacific represents an independent biogeographic province for deep-sea hydrothermal vent fauna. Different degrees of genetic connectivity among vent fields in Manus, North Fiji and Lau Basins have been reported for various molluscan and crustacean species, presumably reflecting their different levels of dispersal ability as swimming larvae. The present study investigates the population connectivity of the hydrothermal vent limpet Shinkailepas tollmanni (family Phenacolepadidae) in the Southwest Pacific. Our analyses using mitochondrial COI-gene sequences and shell morphometric traits suggest a panmictic population structure throughout its geographic and bathymetric ranges, spanning 4,000 km from the westernmost Manus Basin (151ºE; 1,300 m deep) to the easternmost Lau Basin (176ºE; 2,720 m). The measurements of its embryonic and larval shells demonstrate that the species hatches as a planktotrophic veliger larva with an embryonic shell diameter of 170-180 μm and settles at the vent environment with the larval shell diameter of 750-770 μm. This substantial growth as a feeding larva, ca. 80 times in volume, is comparable or even greater than those of confamilial species in the hydrothermal-vent and methane-seep environments in the Northwest Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Large pigmented eyes in newly settled juveniles are another common feature in this and other phenacolepadids inhabiting the chemosynthetic environments. These results put together suggest that the larvae of S. tollmanni migrate vertically from deep-sea vents to surface waters to take advantages of richer food supplies and faster currents and stay pelagic for an extended period of time (> 1 year), as previously indicated for the confamilial species."

https://openalex.org/W3091581934,"In this paper we examine whether it is just the financial cost of maternal healthcare that prevents poor women from utilising free or low-cost government provided healthcare in Dhaka, Bangladesh, or there are other factors at play, in conjunction with poverty. To answer this question, we analyse the perceptions and experiences about the use of maternal health care for childbirth by a group of women residing in poor and lower socio-economic households in Dhaka. Data for this study were collected through in-depth interviews of 34 such women who have already had a child or had become pregnant at least once in the preceding five years. The findings of our analysis suggest that these women have a deeply rooted fear of medical intervention in childbirth for several perceived and practical reasons, including the fear of having to make undocumented payments, unfamiliarity with institutional processes, lack of social and family network support within their neighbourhood, concept of honour and shame [sharam], a culture of silence and inadequate spousal communication on health issues. As a result, even though low-cost health care facilities may be within their reach in terms of physical distance and affordable in terms of financial cost these women and their families are unwilling to deliver their babies at such health facilities. Therefore, in order to allay their perceived fear of hospital-based childbirth, one needs to consider factors other than financial cost and physical distance, and provide these women with factual information and culturally sensitive counselling."
https://openalex.org/W3089452670,"The Chinese poultry industry has experienced outbreaks of Newcastle disease (ND) dating back to the 1920s. However, the epidemic has exhibited a downtrend in recent years. In this study, both observational and genetic data [fusion (F) and haemagglutinin-neuraminidase genes (HN)] were analyzed, and phylogeographic analysis based on prevalent genotypes of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was conducted for better understanding of the evolution and spatiotemporal dynamics of ND in China. In line with the observed trend of epidemic outbreaks, the effective population size of F and HN genes of circulating NDV is no longer growing since 2000, which is supported by 95% highest posterior diversity (HPD) intervals. Phylogeographic analysis indicated that the two eastern coastal provinces, Shandong and Jiangsu were the most relevant hubs for NDV migration, and the geographical regions with active NDV diffusion seemed to be constrained to southern and eastern China. The live poultry trade may play an important role in viral spread. Interestingly, no migration links from wild birds to poultry received Bayes factor support (BF > 3), while the migration links from poultry to wild birds accounted for 64% in all effective migrations. This may indicate that the sporadic cases of ND in wild bird likely spillover events from poultry. These findings contribute to predictive models of NDV transmission, and potentially help in the prevention of future outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W3090059143,"The activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associate protein Arc (or Arg3.1) is specifically linked to memory formation and a number of cognitive disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Since the discovery of Arc in 1995, extensive research has been conducted on the protein to identify its function and mechanisms of action, with solving the structure of Arc as a major goal. However, the Arc protein tends to self-oligomerize in vitro, and is difficult to crystallize. These properties have hindered efforts to obtain the structure of the full-length, whole protein Arc. As an alternative approach, we and others, have sought to solve the structures of various subdomain proteins of Arc, including the N-lobe, C-lobe, and capsid domain (N-lobe + C-lobe). In this study, we characterized the C-terminal tail of Arc using integrated bioinformatic and structural biology techniques. We compared the sequences of Arc proteins in different mammal species and found that the amino-acid composition in the C-terminal tail region has a significantly higher degree of variation rate than the rest of the protein. Structural prediction programs suggested that the C-terminal tail is structurally disordered. Chemical shift analysis based on solution NMR spectra confirmed that the C-terminal tail has a random coil (disordered) structure, and the tail starts from the residue D357. Furthermore, the NMR spectra showed that the C-terminal tail has minimum (if any) interaction with its neighboring capsid domain in Arc. This study fills gaps in our specific understanding of the structural nature and functional contributions of the Arc C-terminus."
https://openalex.org/W3091605767,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) is known to be an important player in inflammatory responses. STAT1 as a transcription factor regulates the expression of multiple proinflammatory genes. Inflammatory response is one of the common effects of ototoxicity. Our group reported that hair cells of STAT1 knockout (STAT1-KO) mice are less sensitive to ototoxic agents in-vitro. The effect of inflammatory responses in STAT1-KO mice has primarily been studied challenging them with several pathogens and analyzing different organs of those mice. However, the effect of STAT1 ablation in the mouse inner ear has not been reported. Therefore, we evaluated the cochlear function of wild type and STAT1-KO mice via auditory brain stem response (ABR) and performed histopathologic analysis of their temporal bones. We found ABR responses were affected in STAT1-KO mice with cases of bilateral and unilateral hearing impairment. Histopathologic examination of the middle and inner ears showed bilateral and unilateral otitis media. Otitis media was characterized by effusion of middle and inner ear that varied between the mice in volume and inflammatory cell content. In addition, the thickness of the middle ear mucosae in STAT1-KO mice were more pronounced than those in wild type mice. The degree of middle and inner ear inflammation correlated with ABR threshold elevation in STAT1-KO mice. It appears that a number of mice with inflammation underwent spontaneous resolution. The ABR thresholds were variable and showed a tendency to increase in homozygous and heterozygous STAT1-KO mice. These findings suggest that STAT1 ablation confers an increased susceptibility to otitis media leading to hearing impairment. Thus, the study supports the new role of STAT1 as otitis media predisposition gene."
https://openalex.org/W3090776367,"A solid understanding of basic sciences is a prerequisite for successful completion of medical education. Therefore, it is essential to improve the quality of teaching and to ensure the applicability of basic sciences. Based on practical experiences and previous research, we developed an innovative step-by-step concept, called ENHANCE, for the implementation or revision of teaching units, especially for basic sciences. We used comparative self-assessment gains, a questionnaire to assess teaching quality as well as end-of-semester evaluations (students’ satisfaction and open-ended questions) to evaluate the ENHANCE concept. It was found that ENHANCE-based teaching units were related to increased students’ satisfaction, high attendance rates and that restructuring the course curriculum yielded in a positive assessment of teaching effectiveness. The revised courses were rated as the very best of all classes in several semesters. Qualitative data showed that students particularly appreciated the level of comprehension and how helpful the courses were for the understanding and preparation of the regular curriculum."
https://openalex.org/W3090931832,"Introduction It is important to study potential differences in pollen concentrations between sampling heights because of diverse outdoor and indoor activity of humans (exposure) at different height levels in urban environments. Previous studies have investigated the effect of height on pollen concentrations based on just one or a few sampling points. We studied the effect of sampling height on grass pollen concentrations in several urban environments with different levels of urbanity. Methods This study was conducted in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland, in 2013 during the pollen season of grasses. Pollen grains were monitored in eight different points in the morning and afternoon. Rotorod-type samplers were attached on sampling poles at the heights of 1.5 meters and 4 meters. Results Grass pollen concentrations were on average higher at the height of 1.5 meters (Helsinki mean 5.24 grains / m3; Espoo mean 75.71 grains / m3) compared to the height of 4 meters (Helsinki mean 3.84 grains / m3; Espoo mean 37.42 grains / m3) with a difference of 1.40 grains / m3 (95% CI -0.21 to 3.01) in Helsinki, and 38.29 grains / m3 (7.52 to 69.07) in Espoo, although not always statistically significant. This was detected both in the morning and in the afternoon. However, in the most urban sites the levels were lower at 1.5 meters compared to 4 meters, whereas in the least urban sites the concentrations were higher at 1.5 meters. In linear regression models with interaction terms, the modifying effect of urbanity on concentration-height relation was statistically significant in both cities. The effect of urbanity on pollen concentrations at both heights was stronger in less urban Espoo. Conclusions The present study provides evidence that height affects the abundance and distribution of grass pollen in urban environments, but this effect depends on the level of urbanity."
https://openalex.org/W3091161177,"Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic metal occurring in the environment naturally. Almond mushroom (Agaricus brasiliensis) is a well-known cultivated edible and medicinal mushroom. In the past few decades, Cd accumulation in A.brasiliensis has received increasing attention. However, the molecular mechanisms of Cd-accumulation in A. brasiliensis are still unclear. In this paper, a comparative transcriptome of two A.brasiliensis strains with contrasting Cd accumulation and tolerance was performed to identify Cd-responsive genes possibly responsible for low Cd-accumulation and high Cd-tolerance. Using low Cd-accumulating and Cd-tolerant (J77) and high Cd-accumulating and Cd-sensitive (J1) A.brasiliensis strains, we investigated 0, 2 and 5 mg L-1 Cd-effects on mycelium growth, Cd-accumulation and transcriptome revealed by RNA-Seq. A total of 57,884 unigenes were obtained. Far less Cd-responsive genes were identified in J77 mycelia than those in J1 mycelia (e.g., ABC transporters, ZIP Zn transporter, Glutathione S-transferase and Cation efflux (CE) family). The higher Cd-accumulation in J1 mycelia might be due to Cd-induced upregulation of ZIP Zn transporter. Cd impaired cell wall, cell cycle, DNA replication and repair, thus decreasing J1 mycelium growth. Cd-stimulated production of sulfur-containing compounds, polysaccharides, organic acids, trehalose, ATP and NADPH, and sequestration of Cd might be adaptive responses of J1 mycelia to the increased Cd-accumulation. DNA replication and repair had better stability under 2 mg L-1 Cd, but greater positive modifications under 5 mg L-1 Cd. Better stability of DNA replication and repair, better cell wall and cell cycle stability might account for the higher Cd-tolerance of J77 mycelia. Our findings provide a comprehensive set of DEGs influenced by Cd stress; and shed light on molecular mechanism of A.brasiliensis Cd accumulation and Cd tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W3091221205,"Cellular homeostasis of zinc, an essential element for living organisms, is tightly regulated by a family of zinc transporters. The zinc transporter 7, ZnT7, is highly expressed on the membrane of the Golgi complex of intestinal epithelial cells and goblet cells. It has previously been shown that Znt7 knockout leads to zinc deficiency and decreased weight gain in C57BL/6 mice on a defined diet. However, effects within the colon are unknown. Given the expression profile of Znt7, we set out to analyze the changes in mucin density and gut microbial composition in the mouse large intestine induced by Znt7 knockout. We fed a semi-purified diet containing 30 mg Zn/kg to Znt7-/- mice with their heterozygous and wild type littermates and found a sex specific effect on colonic mucin density, goblet cell number, and microbiome composition. In male mice Znt7 knockout led to increased goblet cell number and mucin density but had little effect on gut microbiome composition. However, in female mice Znt7 knockout was associated with decreased goblet cell number and mucin density, with increased proportions of the microbial taxa, Allobaculum, relative to wild type. The gut microbial composition was correlated with mucin density in both sexes. These findings suggest that a sex-specific relationship exists between zinc homeostasis, mucin production and the microbial community composition within the colon."
https://openalex.org/W3091221446,"Background The potential effects of botanical dietary supplements (BDS) in the treatment of asthma have been proposed. However, the evidence of the effects of BDS use among patients with COPD is limited. The objective of our study was to exam the trends and effects of BDS use among US adults with COPD. Methods A serial, cross-sectional study was conducted by using data of the NHANSE from 1999 to 2016 (n = 53,348). COPD (n = 2,580) was identified by using self-reported diagnosis history, and any BDS use was identified in the past 30 days. The prevalence of BDS use was calculated for respondents with and without COPD. Simple linear regression models were applied to test for trends in BDS use. Multiple logistic regression models were used to identify the factors of BDS use and patients' clinical outcomes, including all-cause hospitalization and abnormal hemoglobin levels, associated with BDS use. The results were weighted to represent national estimates. Results The prevalence of BDS use was greater among participants who had COPD compared to the referent group (mean 16.77% vs. 15.11%, p = 0.044). The trend of BDS use decreased from 1999 through 2016 in COPD group (p = 0.0023), but the trend remained stable in the non-COPD group (P>0.05). Results of multivariate logistic regression models showed that patients with higher family income (≥100% FPL) and graduated from college were more likely to use BDS compared with non-users. BDS use was associated with a lower likelihood of having all-cause hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio = 0.64; 95% CI 0.45-0.92) and abnormal levels of hemoglobin (adjusted odds ratio = 0.67; 95% CI 0.49-0.92) among adult COPD patients, after adjusting for covariates. Conclusions The overall use of BDS decreased during 1999 through 2016 for US adults with COPD. The potential benefit of these supplemental medications use for clinical outcomes might exist for adult COPD patients."
https://openalex.org/W3134251070,"Rural-to-urban migration and intra-urban residential mobility often lead to improved living conditions. However, it is not clear if this is true for all, especially in cities in developing countries, where inequalities persist and upward mobility remains elusive for marginalized populations. We investigate the effects of intra-urban residential mobility and rural-to-urban migration on standards of living in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We examine the entire residential history of individuals and assess temporal changes in living conditions in their respective housing careers. We use four different aspects of housing as indicators of living conditions from a survey conducted by the World Bank Group that captured the residential history of 2,397 individuals in Dar es Salaam from a spatially representative sample of households. We find that improvements in housing conditions are uneven, a considerable proportion of individuals remained perpetually deprived of adequate housing despite migrating from rural areas to Dar es Salaam and changing multiple homes within the city during their tenure. Our findings indicate that housing disparities persist over time for many. Socioeconomic groups such as migrants tend to experience significant improvements after moving to the city but show limited upward mobility afterwards, an aspect that is rarely addressed in policy discourse on equitable access to adequate housing."
https://openalex.org/W3090068011,"To evaluate the efficacy and long-term patency of endovascular treatment for non-maturing native arteriovenous fistulas according to the approach route (arterial vs. venous).Eighty-five patients underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for non-maturing fistulas (63 radiocephalic and 22 brachiocephalic) between 2010 and 2019. Outcome variables such as procedural success, complications, and primary and secondary patency rates were analyzed from the patients' demographic, angiographic, clinical, and hemodialysis records according to the approach route (venous access group, n = 53 and arterial access group, n = 32). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the patency rates.The mean duration from fistula creation to fistulography was 78.4±51.4 days (range, 1-180 days). The anatomical and clinical success rates were 98.8% and 83.5%, respectively. Lesions were most commonly located at the juxta-anastomosis (55.3%). Accessory cephalic veins were observed in 16 patients. The primary patency rates were 83.9%, 71.9%, and 66.3% and the secondary patency rates were 98.6%, 95.9%, and 94.2% at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year, respectively. The degree of hypertension (P = 0.023), minimal preoperative vein size (P = 0.041), and increment in postoperative vein diameter were higher in the venous access group than in the arterial access group (P<0.01). The frequency of using cutting balloons (P = 0.026) and complication rate were higher in the arterial access group than in the venous access group (arterial access: 1 major, 8 minor; venous access: 4 minor; P = 0.015).Aggressive evaluation and endovascular therapy can salvage most non-maturing fistulas. Transradial and distal radial approaches can be effective even for challenging lesions."
https://openalex.org/W3091512775,"Older adults have difficulties in sentence comprehension when working memory (WM) load increases (e.g., multiple embedded clauses). Structured physical activity has been related to improvements in cognition; however, incidental physical activity (PA, i.e., unstructured daily physical activities), particularly incidental vigorous activity has been poorly studied in relation to its effects on behavior. Furthermore, no positive effect on language has been reported in either form of physical activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate how two levels of PA (high or low) affect WM processing and how this, in turn, may affect morphosyntactic processing in older adults. Individuals with high PA (n = 18) had a higher WM load effect than those with low PA (n = 18), both behaviorally (greater differences between high and low WM loads in correct responses) and in terms of event-related potentials (only subjects with high PA showed LAN and P600b amplitude differences between high and low WM loads). These findings suggest that PA promotes cognitive strategies to face WM loads and morphosyntactic processing."
https://openalex.org/W3091627859,"Introduction At present, information about clinical efficacy and adverse events of controlled release (CR) form of pelubiprofen, a prodrug of 2-arylopropionic acid with relatively selective effects on cyclooxygenase-2 activity, remains scarce. In this study, we sought to determine non-inferiority of pelubiprofen CR 90 mg/day compared to aceclofenac 200 mg/day regarding clinical efficacy and adverse events after a 4-week course of medication in the patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Materials and methods A total of 191 patients were randomly assigned to take either pelubiprofen CR 90 mg (n = 95) or aceclofenac 200 mg (n = 96). The primary outcome variable was non-inferiority of pain reduction between baseline and week 4 when assessed using a 100 mm pain visual analogue scale (VAS). Pelubiprofen was considered non-inferior to aceclofenac if the upper limit of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval for the difference in terms of pain VAS was above 15 mm (the average change of pain VAS in the pelubiprofen group-pain VAS reduction in the aceclofenac group). Secondary outcome variables were the changes in 100 mm pain VAS at week 2 versus baseline, K-Western Ontario, and McMaster University Arthritis Index (K-WOMAC) changes at weeks 2 and 4 as compared to baseline, patient global assessment at weeks 2 and 4. The frequency and amount of rescue medicine usage at weeks 2 and 4 were also evaluated as the secondary outcome variable. For safety analysis, adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical examinations were assessed and conducted at each follow-up visit. Results At week 4, the pain VAS values were significantly reduced in both groups receiving either pelubiprofen CR 90 mg or aceclofenac 200 mg as compared to the baseline. However, the pelubiprofen group and the aceclofenac group respectively showed the pain VAS changes of -22 and -21.9 in the pre-protocol set and -20.8 and -21.7 in the full analysis set, confirming non-inferiority. The pelubiprofen CR 90 mg showed a reduced incidence of adverse events compared to the aceclofenac 200 mg (p = 0.005). Conclusions Pelubiprofen CR 90 mg is as effective as aceclofenac 200 mg with reduced adverse events for the treatment of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis."
https://openalex.org/W3091253091,"Hostility and other related terms like anger and aggression are often used interchangeably to describe antagonistic affect, cognition, and behavior. Psychometric studies suggest that hostility consists of multiple separate factors, but consensus is currently lacking. In the present study we examined the hierarchical structure of hostility. The hierarchical structure of hostility was examined in N = 376 people (i.e., a mixed community and highly hostile sample), using both specific and broad hostility self-report measures. A series of Principal Components Analyses revealed the structure of hostility at five levels of specificity. At intermediate levels, hostility can consistently be expressed in affective, cognitive, and behavioral components. At the most specific level, hostility can be expressed in terms of Angry Affect; Hostile Intent; and Verbal, Relational, and Physical Aggression. The pattern of associations showed significant convergence, and some divergence with broad and more specific hostility measures. The present findings stress the need for novel instruments that capture each hostility facet separately to reduce conceptual confounding."
