https://openalex.org/W2107441200,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is among the most lethal human cancers in part because it is insensitive to many chemotherapeutic drugs. Studying a mouse model of PDA that is refractory to the clinically used drug gemcitabine, we found that the tumors in this model were poorly perfused and poorly vascularized, properties that are shared with human PDA. We tested whether the delivery and efficacy of gemcitabine in the mice could be improved by coadministration of IPI-926, a drug that depletes tumor-associated stromal tissue by inhibition of the Hedgehog cellular signaling pathway. The combination therapy produced a transient increase in intratumoral vascular density and intratumoral concentration of gemcitabine, leading to transient stabilization of disease. Thus, inefficient drug delivery may be an important contributor to chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1975679096,"An important goal in nanotechnology is the programmable self-assembly of complex, three-dimensional nanostructures. With DNA as the building block, synthesis techniques have developed to the stage where two-dimensional designer structures and certain three-dimensional structures can be produced. Douglas et al. describe a refinement of the scaffolded DNA origami technique capable of producing three-dimensional objects of more or less any desired form, to a scale of ten to a hundred nanometres, and with an impressive degree of control over the positions of the various DNA helices. The synthesis involves DNA helices arranged on pleated strands and assembled into honeycomb-like three-dimensional structures. The various strands link together via phosphate groups. The method produces complex objects that are slow to assemble. But it also provides a route towards assembling custom devices with nanometre-scale features, as demonstrated by the construction of objects with shapes resembling a square nut, slotted cross and wire-frame icosahedron. DNA has proved to be a versatile building block in the creation of complex structures through self-assembly, exploiting the intermolecular forces between the components. Here, the arrangement of DNA helices on pleated strands which are then assembled into honeycomb-like three-dimensional structures, produces objects of unprecedented complexity. Molecular self-assembly offers a ‘bottom-up’ route to fabrication with subnanometre precision of complex structures from simple components1. DNA has proved to be a versatile building block2,3,4,5 for programmable construction of such objects, including two-dimensional crystals6, nanotubes7,8,9,10,11, and three-dimensional wireframe nanopolyhedra12,13,14,15,16,17. Templated self-assembly of DNA18 into custom two-dimensional shapes on the megadalton scale has been demonstrated previously with a multiple-kilobase ‘scaffold strand’ that is folded into a flat array of antiparallel helices by interactions with hundreds of oligonucleotide ‘staple strands’19,20. Here we extend this method to building custom three-dimensional shapes formed as pleated layers of helices constrained to a honeycomb lattice. We demonstrate the design and assembly of nanostructures approximating six shapes—monolith, square nut, railed bridge, genie bottle, stacked cross, slotted cross—with precisely controlled dimensions ranging from 10 to 100 nm. We also show hierarchical assembly of structures such as homomultimeric linear tracks and heterotrimeric wireframe icosahedra. Proper assembly requires week-long folding times and calibrated monovalent and divalent cation concentrations. We anticipate that our strategy for self-assembling custom three-dimensional shapes will provide a general route to the manufacture of sophisticated devices bearing features on the nanometre scale."
https://openalex.org/W2054352933,"In sexually reproducing organisms, embryos specify germ cells, which ultimately generate sperm and eggs. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the first germ cell is established when RNA and protein-rich P granules localize to the posterior of the one-cell embryo. Localization of P granules and their physical nature remain poorly understood. Here we show that P granules exhibit liquid-like behaviors, including fusion, dripping, and wetting, which we used to estimate their viscosity and surface tension. As with other liquids, P granules rapidly dissolved and condensed. Localization occurred by a biased increase in P granule condensation at the posterior. This process reflects a classic phase transition, in which polarity proteins vary the condensation point across the cell. Such phase transitions may represent a fundamental physicochemical mechanism for structuring the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2144575277,"Histone acetylation in single-cell eukaryotes relies on acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) synthetase enzymes that use acetate to produce acetyl-CoA. Metazoans, however, use glucose as their main carbon source and have exposure only to low concentrations of extracellular acetate. We have shown that histone acetylation in mammalian cells is dependent on adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-citrate lyase (ACL), the enzyme that converts glucose-derived citrate into acetyl-CoA. We found that ACL is required for increases in histone acetylation in response to growth factor stimulation and during differentiation, and that glucose availability can affect histone acetylation in an ACL-dependent manner. Together, these findings suggest that ACL activity is required to link growth factor-induced increases in nutrient metabolism to the regulation of histone acetylation and gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1989910375,"Of Life, Limb, and a Small RNA Gene expression in mammals is controlled not only by proteins but by small noncoding RNAs called microRNAs. The involvement of these RNAs provides powerful clues about the molecular origins of human diseases and how they might be treated. Ischemic diseases arise from an inadequate blood supply. Bonauer et al. (p. 1710 , published online 21 May) find that a specific microRNA that is expressed in the cells lining blood vessels (called miR-92a) functions to repress the growth of new blood vessels. MiR-92a probably acts through effects on expression of integrins, proteins involved in cell adhesion and migration. In mouse models in which an inadequate blood supply had caused damage either to heart or limb muscle, therapeutic inhibition of miR-92a led to an increase in blood vessel density in the damaged tissues and enhanced functional recovery."

https://openalex.org/W2045342567,"As small RNAs exert profound effects on development and regulation of gene expression, their own expression must be similarly constrained to the right level in the right cell at the right time. A collaboration between the labs of Michael Rosenfeld and Witold Filipowicz reports that the RNA-binding protein KSRP (KH-type splicing regulatory protein) regulates the precursor processing of a subset of microRNAs. If this regulatory mechanism is disrupted, effects can be seen on proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Thus KSRP is involved in both mRNA turnover and in promoting mRNA expression. This work has uncovered a further level of complexity in the regulation of gene expression by mi-RNA. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have a role in down-regulating gene expression, and the levels of specific miRNAs are important for correct embryonic development; however, the mechanisms by which this is regulated are unknown. The splicing regulatory protein, KSRP, is now found to regulate the precursor processing of a subset of miRNAs, and its disruption leads to effects on proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Consistent with the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in down-regulating gene expression by reducing the translation and/or stability of target messenger RNAs1, the levels of specific miRNAs are important for correct embryonic development and have been linked to several forms of cancer2,3,4. However, the regulatory mechanisms by which primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) are processed first to precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) and then to mature miRNAs by the multiprotein Drosha and Dicer complexes5,6,7,8, respectively, remain largely unknown. The KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP, also known as KHSRP) interacts with single-strand AU-rich-element-containing mRNAs and is a key mediator of mRNA decay9,10. Here we show in mammalian cells that KSRP also serves as a component of both Drosha and Dicer complexes and regulates the biogenesis of a subset of miRNAs. KSRP binds with high affinity to the terminal loop of the target miRNA precursors and promotes their maturation. This mechanism is required for specific changes in target mRNA expression that affect specific biological programs, including proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. These findings reveal an unexpected mechanism that links KSRP to the machinery regulating maturation of a cohort of miRNAs that, in addition to its role in promoting mRNA decay, independently serves to integrate specific regulatory programs of protein expression."

Using data from a radio pulsar survey, Archibald et al. (p. 1411 , published online 21 May; see the Perspective by Kramer ) found a neutron star in a low-mass X-ray binary that is in the process of turning into a radio millisecond pulsar. The system, which consists of a solar-like star and a 1.69-millisecond radio pulsar, has gone through a recent accretion phase, characteristic of low-mass X-ray binaries, but it shows no accretion disk anymore, confirming the evolutionary connection between millisecond radio pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries."
https://openalex.org/W2112216401,"The mechanisms by which Geobacter sulfurreducens transfers electrons through relatively thick (>50 µm) biofilms to electrodes acting as a sole electron acceptor were investigated. Biofilms of Geobacter sulfurreducens were grown either in flow-through systems with graphite anodes as the electron acceptor or on the same graphite surface, but with fumarate as the sole electron acceptor. Fumarate-grown biofilms were not immediately capable of significant current production, suggesting substantial physiological differences from current-producing biofilms. Microarray analysis revealed 13 genes in current-harvesting biofilms that had significantly higher transcript levels. The greatest increases were for pilA, the gene immediately downstream of pilA, and the genes for two outer c-type membrane cytochromes, OmcB and OmcZ. Down-regulated genes included the genes for the outer-membrane c-type cytochromes, OmcS and OmcT. Results of quantitative RT-PCR of gene transcript levels during biofilm growth were consistent with microarray results. OmcZ and the outer-surface c-type cytochrome, OmcE, were more abundant and OmcS was less abundant in current-harvesting cells. Strains in which pilA, the gene immediately downstream from pilA, omcB, omcS, omcE, or omcZ was deleted demonstrated that only deletion of pilA or omcZ severely inhibited current production and biofilm formation in current-harvesting mode. In contrast, these gene deletions had no impact on biofilm formation on graphite surfaces when fumarate served as the electron acceptor. These results suggest that biofilms grown harvesting current are specifically poised for electron transfer to electrodes and that, in addition to pili, OmcZ is a key component in electron transfer through differentiated G. sulfurreducens biofilms to electrodes."

https://openalex.org/W1969231641,"The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a mainstay of clinical neurology and is tightly correlated with brain function, but the specific currents generating human EEG elements remain poorly specified because of a lack of microphysiological recordings. The largest event in healthy human EEGs is the K-complex (KC), which occurs in slow-wave sleep. Here, we show that KCs are generated in widespread cortical areas by outward dendritic currents in the middle and upper cortical layers, accompanied by decreased broadband EEG power and decreased neuronal firing, which demonstrate a steep decline in network activity. Thus, KCs are isolated ""down-states,"" a fundamental cortico-thalamic processing mode already characterized in animals. This correspondence is compatible with proposed contributions of the KC to sleep preservation and memory consolidation."
https://openalex.org/W2004599241,"The incidence of many cancer types is significantly reduced in individuals with Down's syndrome, and it is thought that this broad cancer protection is conferred by the increased expression of one or more of the 231 supernumerary genes on the extra copy of chromosome 21. One such gene is Down's syndrome candidate region-1 (DSCR1, also known as RCAN1), which encodes a protein that suppresses vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated angiogenic signalling by the calcineurin pathway. Here we show that DSCR1 is increased in Down's syndrome tissues and in a mouse model of Down's syndrome. Furthermore, we show that the modest increase in expression afforded by a single extra transgenic copy of Dscr1 is sufficient to confer significant suppression of tumour growth in mice, and that such resistance is a consequence of a deficit in tumour angiogenesis arising from suppression of the calcineurin pathway. We also provide evidence that attenuation of calcineurin activity by DSCR1, together with another chromosome 21 gene Dyrk1a, may be sufficient to markedly diminish angiogenesis. These data provide a mechanism for the reduced cancer incidence in Down's syndrome and identify the calcineurin signalling pathway, and its regulators DSCR1 and DYRK1A, as potential therapeutic targets in cancers arising in all individuals."

https://openalex.org/W1964016865,"Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been used to inhibit HIV-1 replication. The durable inhibition of HIV-1 replication by RNA interference has been impeded, however, by a high mutation rate when viral sequences are targeted and by cytotoxicity when cellular genes are knocked down. To identify cellular proteins that contribute to HIV-1 replication that can be chronically silenced without significant cytotoxicity, we employed a shRNA library that targets 54,509 human transcripts. We used this library to select a comprehensive population of Jurkat T-cell clones, each expressing a single discrete shRNA. The Jurkat clones were then infected with HIV-1. Clones that survived viral infection represent moieties silenced for a human mRNA needed for virus replication, but whose chronic knockdown did not cause cytotoxicity. Overall, 252 individual Jurkat mRNAs were identified. Twenty-two of these mRNAs were secondarily verified for their contributions to HIV-1 replication. Five mRNAs, NRF1, STXBP2, NCOA3, PRDM2, and EXOSC5, were studied for their effect on steps of the HIV-1 life cycle. We discuss the similarities and differences between our shRNA findings for HIV-1 using a spreading infection assay in human Jurkat T-cells and results from other investigators who used siRNA-based screenings in HeLa or 293T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2028551167,"Growth hormone (GH) plays a pivotal role in growth and metabolism, with growth promotion mostly attributed to generation of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in liver or at local sites of GH action, whereas the metabolic effects of GH are considered to be intrinsic to GH itself. To distinguish the effects of GH from those of IGF-I, we developed a Cre-lox-mediated model of tissue-specific deletion of the growth hormone receptor (GHR). Near total deletion of the GHR in liver (GHRLD) had no effect on total body or bone linear growth despite a >90% suppression of circulating IGF-I; however, total bone density was significantly reduced. Circulating GH was increased 4-fold, and GHRLD displayed insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and increased circulating free fatty acids. Livers displayed marked steatosis, the result of increased triglyceride synthesis and decreased efflux; reconstitution of hepatic GHR signaling via adenoviral expression of GHR restored triglyceride output to normal, whereas IGF-I infusion did not correct steatosis despite restoration of circulating GH to normal. Thus, with near total absence of circulating IGF-I, GH action at the growth plate, directly and via locally generated IGF-I, can regulate bone growth, but at the expense of diabetogenic, lipolytic, and hepatosteatotic consequences. Our results indicate that IGF-I is essential for bone mineral density, whereas hepatic GH signaling is essential to regulate intrahepatic lipid metabolism.

Growth Horm IGF Res. 2008; 18: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Growth hormone levels were measured with the mouse growth hormone ELISA kit (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. The total RNA of liver samples was isolated using an RNA minikit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out on cDNA prepared from DNase I-treated RNA (Superscript III cDNA kit, Invitrogen) with the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit and analyzed with the LightCycler 2 system (Roche Applied Science). Livers were harvested, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 3 h at 4 °C, and placed in 30% sucrose overnight. Cryosections 5 μm thick were cut and stained with GHR (L-15) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). For the detection of neutral lipid, liver cryosections were stained with the Oil Red O technique with 0.23% dye dissolved in 65% isopropyl alcohol for 10 min. To analyze the growth plate, tibia bones were harvested from 12-week-old male mice and fixed in 10% formalin followed by decalcification in 100 mm EDTA for 10 days. Animals were fasted for 16 and 3 h before intraperitoneal injection of glucose (2 g/kg of body weight) and insulin (0.8 units/kg of body weight), respectively. Blood was obtained at intervals of 15 min from the tail vein, and glucose and insulin levels were analyzed as described above. Both serum-free fatty acid levels and plasma triglyceride concentrations were measured using commercially available kits (NEFA-HR kit from Wako Diagnostics and Infinity triglyceride kit from Thermo Electron Corp., respectively). To measure hepatic triglyceride production rate, mice were injected with Triton WR-1339 (1 g/kg of body weight, Sigma) after 4 h of fasting, and plasma triglyceride levels was measured over a 3-hr period. The triglyceride production rate was calculated from the difference in plasma triglyceride levels over the first 90 min. Fat and lean (muscle) compositions of 16-week-old male mice were analyzed by an EchoMRI whole body composition analyzer (Echo Medical Systems, Houston, Texas). Adenoviruses expressing either full-length mouse Ghr or full-length mouse LacZ were administrated to 12-week-old female Ghrliver-specific deletion (GHRLD) mice through the tail vein (109 infectious particles/mouse). Treated animals were subjected to experimental characterization 2 weeks after reconstitution. For the IGF-I infusion experiment, osmotic minipumps (DURECT Co., Cupertino, CA) loaded with either rhIGF-I or placebo (Tercica, Inc., Brisbane, CA) were implanted subcutaneously into the mid-back region of 16-week-old male GHRLD mice. Daily infusion dosage was 26.4 μg. After 2 weeks, the animals were sacrificed, and livers were harvested for analysis. In all experiments, unless specified, we used two-tail Student's t tests to assess statistical significance. p value < 0.05 was considered as significant. To enable the study of the specific effects of GH in a particular tissue, we flanked exon 4 of the mouse Ghr gene, which encodes a portion of the extracellular domain of the GH receptor, with two loxP sites and generated homozygous animals harboring the floxed Ghr alleles (Ghrfl/fl) (Fig. 1, A and B). Global deletion of Ghr obtained after crossing Ghrfl/fl to E2a-Cre mice resulted in progeny with severe postnatal growth failure, consistent with the phenotype of Laron mice (19Zhou Y. Xu B.C. Maheshwari H.G. He L. Reed M. Lozykowski M. Okada S. Cataldo L. Coschigamo K. Wagner T.E. Baumann G. Kopchick J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To delete GHR expression specifically in hepatocytes, Ghrfl/fl mice were crossed to albumin-cre transgenic mice, resulting in Ghrfl/fl; Alb−cre mice, designated as GHRLD mice (Fig. 2A). In these mice, Ghr expression in either muscle or fat tissue remained unchanged, whereas liver Ghr mRNA levels were extinguished (Fig. 2B). Quantification of Ghr mRNA expression revealed greater than 90% deletion in the GHRLD liver; the residual Ghr transcripts may represent Ghr mRNA in endothelial cells and/or Kupfer cells that would not be affected by the albumin-driven Cre (Fig. 2C). When analyzed by immunohistochemistry, hepatocyte GHR protein expression in GHRLD mice was absent (Fig. 2D).FIGURE 2Liver-specific deletion of the mouse Ghr gene. A, schematic view for generating the GHRLD mice.

Consistent with these measurements, tibia lengths, reflecting longitudinal bone growth, were identical between GHRLD and control mice (Table 2 and Fig. 3A), as were the size of the growth plates (Fig. 3B). However, bone density was markedly diminished in the GHRLD mice, as demonstrated both by x-ray and by micro-CT analysis (Fig. 3, C and D). Quantitative analysis of bone volume as a fraction of the total volume revealed a highly significant difference between the control and GHRLD mice at 16 weeks (Fig. 3E).TABLE 2Normal growth of GHRLD miceBody weightBody lengthaSnout to tail base.Tibia lengthgcmcmControl (n = 8)25.00 ± 0.869.07 ± 0.071.80 ± 0.02GHRLD (n = 6)23.45 ± 0.678.88 ± 0.111.82 ± 0.03a Snout to tail base.

Open table in a new tab Non-fasting glucose levels were normal, but plasma insulin levels were 2–3 times elevated when compared with controls, indicative of insulin resistance (Fig. 4, A and B), which was confirmed by an intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (Fig. 4C). An intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test demonstrated glucose intolerance in the GHRLD mice at 4–6 weeks of age (Fig. 4D). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of liver mRNA revealed that there were no significant alterations in the steady state abundance of mRNAs for three key gluconeogenic enzymes, Fbp1, G6Pase, and Pck1, suggesting that the impaired glucose disposal in GHRLD mice was not due to increased hepatic gluconeogenesis (Fig. 4E). GH is lipolytic, and high levels of GH in blood act to increase lipolysis in adipocytes and enhance triglyceride secretion from the liver (2LeRoith D. Yakar S. Nat. Clin. Pract Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 3: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Serum free fatty acid levels were 30% higher in GHRLD mice when compared with controls (Fig. 5A). Livers were glistening, suggesting increased lipid content (Fig. 5B), which was confirmed by demonstrating a creamy layer on gravitational sedimentation of liver homogenate extracts (Fig. 5C). Histochemical analysis revealed hepatic steatosis (Fig. 5D). Fat accumulation in liver arose in part by enhanced lipogenesis from increased free fatty acid flux with ∼10-fold up-regulation of Srebp-1c expression, ∼4–5-fold up-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), as well as ∼20-fold increase of fatty acid translocase/CD36 (Fat), key regulators of hepatic triglyceride synthesis (20Shimano H. J. Mol. Med. 2007; 85: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5E). Although the expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (Mttp) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) was unchanged, triglyceride secretion from the liver was markedly impaired (1.1 mg/dl/min versus controls of 3.7 mg/dl/min, p < 0.001) (Fig. 5F) when measured by triglyceride concentration in blood during the 3 h after administration of the lipoprotein lipase inhibitor Triton WR-1339 (21Millar J.S. Cromley D.A. McCoy M.G. Rader D.J. Billheimer J.T. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 2023-2028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Rescue of GHR signaling in livers of GHRLD mice via adenovirus-mediated GHR expression completely restored hepatic triglyceride output to normal, as well as restoring glucose tolerance (Figs. 5F and 6). By contrast, infusion of rhIGF-I (26.4 μg/day for 14 days) via subcutaneously implanted mini Alzet pumps failed to correct hepatic steatosis, although circulating GH was restored to normal (Fig. 7).FIGURE 7Infusion of GHRLD with IGF-I failed to rescue hepatic steatosis. A, mini osmotic pumps filled with either IGF-I or placebo were implanted subcutaneously into 16-week-old male GHRLD mice. As shown, IGF-I infusion (26.4 μg/day) efficiently normalized the serum GH levels (approximately one-quarter of the GHRLD mice treated with placebo). Error bars indicate mean ± S.E. B, histological sections of livers harvested from GHRLD mice treated with either placebo (left) or IGF-I (right) for 2 weeks were stained with Oil Red O. Similar lipid contents were observed under both conditions, indicating that IGF-I infusion did not correct hepatic steatosis despite restoration of circulation GH concentration to normal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our model of liver-specific GHR deletion demonstrates that circulating IGF-I is derived primarily from hepatic production and that circulating IGF-I is not essential for normal postnatal growth in the mouse. Our results also establish a novel and critical role for hepatic GH signaling in maintenance of lipid homeostasis. The fundamental difference between the current model of inducing deficiency of circulating IGF-I via tissue-specific deletion of GHR in liver with total abrogation of growth hormone signaling in liver and previously reported models of IGF-I deficiency secondary to deletion of the igf-i gene in liver is that with the exception of IGF-I generation, GHR signaling is intact in these latter models. Previous studies wherein the igf-i gene was deleted in liver or ALS was knocked out globally, and which resulted in an ∼65–80% reduction of circulating IGF-I, also reported that growth was unaltered (11Sjögren K. Liu J.L. Blad K. Skrtic S. Vidal O. Wallenius V. LeRoith D. Törnell J. Isaksson O.G. Jansson J.O. Ohlsson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

U.S.A. 1999; 96: 7324-7329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). However, it was considered possible that the remaining 20–35% of circulating IGF-I was sufficient to allow normal growth in those models, as suggested by the authors (11Sjögren K. Liu J.L. Blad K. Skrtic S. Vidal O. Wallenius V. LeRoith D. Törnell J. Isaksson O.G. Jansson J.O. Ohlsson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 7088-7092Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 12Sjögren K.

Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 7324-7329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). By demonstrating virtual total suppression of circulating IGF-I (∼95%), our study leads to the conclusion that circulating growth hormone alone is sufficient to promote normal growth, providing that GHR, along with its intact post-receptor signaling cascade, is expressed in the remaining tissues outside of the liver, specifically at the growth plate (23Nilsson A. Isgaard J. Lindahl A. Dahlström A. Skottner A. Isaksson O.G. Science. 1986; 233: 571-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Another possible explanation for normal growth in our model would be that free IGF-I levels remained sufficient to sustain bone growth via circulating IGF-I. However, deletion of GHR expression in all tissues of our mouse model leads to recapitulation of the Laron mouse with markedly impaired growth, as described previously (19Zhou Y. Xu B.C. Maheshwari H.G. He L. Reed M. Lozykowski M. Okada S. Cataldo L. Coschigamo K. Wagner T.E. Baumann G. Kopchick J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 13215-13220Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), and lends further support to the proposition that growth hormone must act at local tissues for both direct effects as well as the generation of local IGF-I-mediated growth (24Nilsson O. Marino R. De Luca F. Phillip M. Baron J. Hormone Res. 2005; 64: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Because total deletion of IGF-I also results in impaired fetal growth and survival and causes developmental abnormalities of brain, lung, muscle, and bone, as well as postnatal growth retardation and infertility, IGF-I is clearly critical for growth and development (10Lupu F. Terwilliger J.D. Lee K. Segre G.V. Efstratiadis A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 229: 141-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The most likely explanation for retention of normal postnatal growth in our model is that the higher circulating growth hormone concentrations, the result of the lack of inhibition by circulating IGF-I on pituitary growth hormone secretion, have direct effects to promote bone and tissue growth as well as local generation of IGF-I, which mediates growth via paracrine-autocrine effects (5Kaplan S.A. Cohen P. J. Clin. Endocrinol Metab. 2007; 92: 4529-4535Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 6Wang J. Zhou J. Cheng C.M. Kopchick J.J. Bondy C.A. J.

U.S.A. 1999; 96: 7324-7329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Alternatively, even normal GH concentrations may have resulted in normal growth in the absence of circulating IGF-I. The data suggest, however, that higher GH concentrations compensated for the lack of IGF-I because long term observation of the GHRLD mice did not reveal augmented growth despite the 4-fold increase in circulating GH levels. Hepatic-derived IGF-I is critical for normal bone architecture, as shown by the reduced bone mineral density in our animals. In the model of combined liver-specific IGF-I deletion together with global ALS knock-out, both circulating IGF-I from the liver, and local IGF-I signaling were impaired due to the global absence of ALS, resulting in impaired growth and a smaller growth plate (8Yakar S. Rosen C.J. Beamer W.G. Ackert-Bicknell C.L. Wu Y. Liu J.L. Ooi G.T. Setser J. Frystyk J. Boisclair Y.R. LeRoith D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). A major difference between this model and ours, however, is that the availability of ALS at the bone environment may contribute to IGF activity in our model because the als gene itself was not disrupted. The kidneys of the GHRLD animals were significantly lighter than controls, documenting that unlike bone growth, hepatic-derived IGF-I has an important role in kidney growth, as suggested previously (25Svensson J. Tivesten A. Sjögren K. Isaksson O. Bergström G. Mohan S. Mölne J. Isgaard J. Ohlsson C. J. Endocrinol. 2007; 193: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 26Imberti B. Morigi M. Tomasoni S.

In contrast to the lack of effects on bone growth, deletion of GHR expression in liver revealed a novel and essential role of hepatic GH signaling for the maintenance of normal metabolism with primary effects focused on hepatic lipid metabolism and secondary effects focused on peripheral lipolysis, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. Although the effects of excessive GH action in inducing insulin resistance and glucose intolerance were anticipated (7Liu J.L. Yakar S. LeRoith D. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 2000; 223: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 11Sjögren K. Liu J.L. Blad K. Skrtic S. Vidal O. Wallenius V. LeRoith D. Törnell J. Isaksson O.G. Jansson J.O. Ohlsson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 7088-7092Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar), the effects on hepatic lipid metabolism were unexpected. Peripheral insulin resistance with hyperinsulinemia and increased free fatty acid existed in other models of circulating IGF-I deficiency with increased circulating GH concentrations. However, hepatic steatosis did not occur in the originally reported Laron mouse (16Fan Y. Melhem M.F. Chaillet J.R. Developmental Biology. 1999; 210: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), nor in our global deletion model, and was not reported in the LID mouse where hepatic GH-GHR signaling remained intact (7Liu J.L. Yakar S. LeRoith D. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 2000; 223: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It must be emphasized that increased circulating GH concentrations with peripheral insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and increased free fatty acid existed in these models of circulating IGF-I deficiency. Thus, GH signaling appears to be essential for intrahepatic lipid metabolism because restoration of GHR signaling via the adenoviral GHR construct totally restored hepatic triglyceride output to normal. Hepatic steatosis has recently been described in mice in which STAT5b has been abrogated in liver (27Cui Y. Hosui A. Sun R. Shen K. Gavrilova O. Chen W. Cam M.C. Gao B. Robinson G.W. Hennighausen L. Hepatology. 2007; 46: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In these animals, IGF-I was reduced by only 50% and triglyceride output was not reported. Because the STAT5b is an essential component of the canonical signaling cascade for the GHR receptor, our current studies are the first to uncover a direct link between a circulating ligand and the liver phenotype secondary to hepatic STAT5b deficiency. Thus, the lack of GH signaling in liver is associated with hepatic steatosis and raises the possibility that the hepatic steatosis observed in obesity may be caused, in part, by the state of decreased growth hormone secretion and signaling that occurs in obesity (28Johannsson G. Bengtsson B.A. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1999; 22: 41-46PubMed Google Scholar). The peripheral metabolic defects observed in our animals are likely to be the direct result of increased pituitary growth hormone secretion and action in tissues in which growth hormone receptor expression remained unaltered (29Yakar S. Setser J. Zhao H. Stannard B. Haluzik M. Glatt V. Bouxsein M.L. Kopchick J.J. LeRoith D. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In addition to its lipolytic effects, growth hormone induces a state of insulin resistance (2LeRoith D. Yakar S. Nat. Clin. Pract Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 3: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 3Sherwin R.S. Schulman G.A. Hendler R. Walesky M. Belous A. Tamborlane W. Diabetologia. 1983; 24: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 4Clemmons D.R. Pituitary. 2002; 5: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), manifest in our animals by a raised plasma concentration of insulin, resistance to insulin-mediated hypoglycemia, and glucose intolerance. Although growth hormone is also reported to enhance hepatic gluconeogenesis (3Sherwin R.S. Schulman G.A. Hendler R. Walesky M. Belous A. Tamborlane W. Diabetologia. 1983; 24: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), this mechanism was excluded because of the absence of hepatic GH signaling in our animals and because there were no changes in the expression of the three key gluconeogenic enzymes, G6Pase, Fbp1, and Pck1, in the liver. Recently, it has been suggested that GH regulates p85α expression and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity in white adipose tissue and that this mechanism is responsible for insulin resistance and reduced fat mass observed in mice with growth hormone excess (14del Rincon J.P. Iida K. Gaylinn B.D. McCurdy C.E. Leitner J.W. Barbour L.A. Kopchick J.J. Friedman J.E. Draznin B. Thorner M.O. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Because growth hormone was increased in our animals and growth hormone signaling in fat tissue remained intact, this is a possible mechanism for the observed insulin resistance. Additionally, the increased circulating free fatty acid likely contributed to insulin resistance through direct or indirect generation of metabolites that alter the insulin-signaling cascade in various tissues (30Delarue J. Magnan C. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2007; 10: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The lack of appreciable effect of circulating IGF-I on growth challenges the classic somatomedin hypothesis (5Kaplan S.A. Cohen P. J. Clin. Endocrinol Metab. 2007; 92: 4529-4535Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), which postulates that growth is mediated by a “second messenger,” eventually named IGF-I, generated from the liver. Our studies suggest that hepatic-derived circulating IGF-I signaling is essential for normal kidney growth and normal bone density, which cannot be compensated by elevated GH alone, consistent with findings in the Laron mouse and human (19Zhou Y. Xu B.C. Maheshwari H.G. He L. Reed M. Lozykowski M. Okada S. Cataldo L. Coschigamo K. Wagner T.E. Baumann G. Kopchick J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 13215-13220Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 25Svensson J. Tivesten A. Sjögren K. Isaksson O. Bergström G. Mohan S. Mölne J. Isgaard J. Ohlsson C. J.

Zoja C. Remuzzi G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2007; 18: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been proposed that the combined effects of the GH-IGF-I system serve to augment the anabolic actions of GH, while concurrently counteracting its potential harmful effects in inducing insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus and limiting its lipolytic effects to prevent depletion of lipid stores (5Kaplan S.A. Cohen P. J. Clin. Endocrinol Metab. 2007; 92: 4529-4535Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is consistent with our findings because despite high GH concentrations, growth was normal, but not excessive as found in acromegaly. Thus, in the presence of normal hepatic GH signaling and hepatic IGF-I generation, normal growth is attained at approximately one-quarter of the circulating GH concentration required to maintain growth in our model and without inducing insulin resistance, diabetes, and excessive lipolysis. In conclusion, the ability to delete GHR and its signaling cascade in liver demonstrates that circulating IGF-I is not an essential mediator of bone growth, although it is essential for normal bone mineral accretion. Notably, GH signaling in liver is essential for normal intrahepatic lipid metabolism. The ability to delete GHR signaling in specific tissues such as fat, muscle, and bone will permit a clearer delineation of the specific direct effects of growth hormone and its indirect effects on local tissue generated IGF-I for growth and provide an opportunity to identify the tissue sites and signaling mechanisms by which growth hormone induces insulin resistance.

https://openalex.org/W2034734239,"2 Be or Not 2 Be? The beryllium dimer is a rather simple-looking compound, bridging two atoms of the fourth-lightest element. Yet it has long posed a frustrating challenge to theorists, because, to a first approximation, chemical bonding models suggest that it should not exist. In recent decades, calculations of ever-increasing sophistication have offered rationales for the two atoms' puzzling mutual attraction. Now Merritt et al. (p. 1548 , published online 21 May; see the Perspective by Bernath ) have used high-resolution spectroscopy to assemble, at last, a full experimental potential energy function describing the ground electronic state of Be 2 . The curve is unusually shallow at long bond lengths, deviating from the contour of more traditional molecular Morse potentials, and provides a detailed basis of comparison for future theoretical bonding frameworks."

https://openalex.org/W2099089255,"The Mars rover Opportunity has explored Victoria crater, an approximately 750-meter eroded impact crater formed in sulfate-rich sedimentary rocks. Impact-related stratigraphy is preserved in the crater walls, and meteoritic debris is present near the crater rim. The size of hematite-rich concretions decreases up-section, documenting variation in the intensity of groundwater processes. Layering in the crater walls preserves evidence of ancient wind-blown dunes. Compositional variations with depth mimic those approximately 6 kilometers to the north and demonstrate that water-induced alteration at Meridiani Planum was regional in scope."
https://openalex.org/W2095222021,"The observation that many features of the Martian landscape appear to have been formed by liquid water sits uncomfortably with the fact that models of the early Martian climate suggest that global mean surface temperatures were rarely above 0 °C. Fairén et al. offer a possible resolution to this paradox. They model the freezing and evaporation processes of Martian fluids assuming a chemical composition produced by the weathering of basalts, as reflected in the data obtained from Mars landing sites. They find that a significant fraction of weathering fluids loaded with solutes remain in the liquid state at temperatures well below 0 °C. This suggests that the surface features that we see were carved out by flows of saline liquid water. Many features of the Martian landscape are thought to have been formed by liquid water flow. However, several lines of evidence suggest that mean global temperatures on early Mars were well below the freezing point of pure water. Here, the modelling of freezing and evaporation of Martian fluids with a chemical composition resulting from the weathering of basalts—as reflected in the chemical compositions found at Mars landing sites—suggests that a significant fraction would remain in the liquid state at temperatures well below 273 K. Many features of the Martian landscape are thought to have been formed by liquid water flow1,2 and water-related mineralogies on the surface of Mars are widespread and abundant3. Several lines of evidence, however, suggest that Mars has been cold with mean global temperatures well below the freezing point of pure water4. Martian climate modellers5,6 considering a combination of greenhouse gases at a range of partial pressures find it challenging to simulate global mean Martian surface temperatures above 273 K, and local thermal sources7,8 cannot account for the widespread distribution of hydrated and evaporitic minerals throughout the Martian landscape3. Solutes could depress the melting point of water9,10 in a frozen Martian environment, providing a plausible solution to the early Mars climate paradox. Here we model the freezing and evaporation processes of Martian fluids with a composition resulting from the weathering of basalts, as reflected in the chemical compositions at Mars landing sites. Our results show that a significant fraction of weathering fluids loaded with Si, Fe, S, Mg, Ca, Cl, Na, K and Al remain in the liquid state at temperatures well below 273 K. We tested our model by analysing the mineralogies yielded by the evolution of the solutions: the resulting mineral assemblages are analogous to those actually identified on the Martian surface. This stability against freezing of Martian fluids can explain saline liquid water activity on the surface of Mars at mean global temperatures well below 273 K."
https://openalex.org/W2080629652,Reconstructing ancient communities depends on how accurately fossil assemblages retain information about living populations. We report a high level of fidelity between modern bone assemblages and living populations based on a 40-year study of the Amboseli ecosystem in southern Kenya. Relative abundance of 15 herbivorous species recorded in the bone assemblage accurately tracks the living populations through major changes in community composition and habitat over intervals as short as 5 years. The aggregated bone sample provides an accurate record of community structure time-averaged over four decades. These results lay the groundwork for integrating paleobiological and contemporary ecological studies across evolutionary and ecological time scales. Bone surveys also provide a useful method of assessing population changes and community structure for modern vertebrates.
https://openalex.org/W2064904687,"A Jump on Catalyst Kinetics A common method for interrogating fast reaction kinetics is to create an abrupt initiation point, and, for reactions catalyzed by metals on oxide supports, one option is to induce a rapid temperature jump, provided that the part of the catalyst undergoing heating can be probed locally. Thibault-Starzyk et al. (p. 1048 ) used femtosecond laser pulses to heat catalysts for nitrogen oxide removal and followed the reaction with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. These catalysts are designed to remove NO in fuel-efficient lean-burn engines through reaction with CO, rather than with hydrocarbons. A cyanide reaction intermediate was identified that moves from the silver nanoparticle to the alumina surface."
https://openalex.org/W1979304160,"Artistic creativity forms the basis of music culture and music industry. Composing, improvising and arranging music are complex creative functions of the human brain, which biological value remains unknown. We hypothesized that practicing music is social communication that needs musical aptitude and even creativity in music. In order to understand the neurobiological basis of music in human evolution and communication we analyzed polymorphisms of the arginine vasopressin receptor 1A (AVPR1A), serotonin transporter (SLC6A4), catecol-O-methyltranferase (COMT), dopamin receptor D2 (DRD2) and tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), genes associated with social bonding and cognitive functions in 19 Finnish families (n = 343 members) with professional musicians and/or active amateurs. All family members were tested for musical aptitude using the auditory structuring ability test (Karma Music test; KMT) and Carl Seashores tests for pitch (SP) and for time (ST). Data on creativity in music (composing, improvising and/or arranging music) was surveyed using a web-based questionnaire. Here we show for the first time that creative functions in music have a strong genetic component (h2 = .84; composing h2 = .40; arranging h2 = .46; improvising h2 = .62) in Finnish multigenerational families. We also show that high music test scores are significantly associated with creative functions in music (p<.0001). We discovered an overall haplotype association with AVPR1A gene (markers RS1 and RS3) and KMT (p = 0.0008; corrected p = 0.00002), SP (p = 0.0261; corrected p = 0.0072) and combined music test scores (COMB) (p = 0.0056; corrected p = 0.0006). AVPR1A haplotype AVR+RS1 further suggested a positive association with ST (p = 0.0038; corrected p = 0.00184) and COMB (p = 0.0083; corrected p = 0.0040) using haplotype-based association test HBAT. The results suggest that the neurobiology of music perception and production is likely to be related to the pathways affecting intrinsic attachment behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2024576544,"The seven members of the NOX/DUOX family are responsible for generation of the superoxide and H(2)O(2) required for a variety of host defense and cell signaling functions in nonphagocytic cells. Two members, the dual oxidase isozymes DUOX1 and DUOX2, share a structurally unique feature: an N-terminal peroxidase-like domain. Despite sequence similarity to the mammalian peroxidases, the absence of key active site residues makes their binding of heme and their catalytic function uncertain. To explore this domain we have expressed in a baculovirus system and purified the Caenorhabditis elegans (CeDUOX1(1-589)) and human (hDUOX1(1-593)) DUOX1 ""peroxidase"" domains. Evaluation of these proteins demonstrated that the isolated hDUOX1(1-593) does not bind heme and has no intrinsic peroxidase activity. In contrast, CeDUOX1(1-589) binds heme covalently, exhibits a modest peroxidase activity, but does not oxidize bromide ion. Surprisingly, the heme appears to have two covalent links to the protein despite the absence of a second conserved carboxyl group in the active site. Although the N-terminal dual oxidase motif has been proposed to directly convert superoxide to H(2)O(2), neither DUOX1 domain demonstrated significant superoxide dismutase activity. These results strengthen the in vivo conclusion that the CeDUOX1 protein supports controlled peroxidative polymerization of tyrosine residues and indicate that the hDUOX1 protein either has a unique function or must interact with other protein factors to express its catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1972471919,"The PSA-Cre;Pten-loxP/loxP mouse prostate cancer model displays clearly defined stages of hyperplasia and cancer. Here, the initial stages of hyperplasia development are studied. Immunohistochemical staining showed that accumulated pAkt+ hyperplastic cells overexpress luminal epithelial cell marker CK8, and progenitor cell markers CK19 and Sca-1, but not basal epithelial cell markers. By expression profiling we identified novel hyperplastic cell markers, including Tacstd2 and Clu. Further we showed that at young age prostates of targeted Pten knockout mice contained in the luminal epithelial cell layer single pAkt+ cells, which overexpressed CK8, Sca-1, Tacstd2 and Clu; basal epithelial cells were always pAkt−. Importantly, in the luminal epithelial cell layer of normal prostates we detected rare Clu+Tacstd2+Sca-1+ progenitor cells. These novel cells are candidate tumor initiating cells in Pten knockout mice. Remarkably, all luminal epithelial cells in the proximal region of normal prostates were Clu+Tacstd2+Sca-1+. However, in PSA-Cre;Pten-loxP/loxP mice, the proximal prostate does not contain hyperplastic foci. Small hyperplastic foci in prostates of PSA-Cre;Pten-loxP/+ mice found at old age, showed complete Pten inactivation and a progenitor marker profile. Finally, we present a novel model of prostate development and renewal, including lineage-specific luminal epithelial progenitor cells. It is proposed that Pten deficiency induces a shift in the balance of differentiation to proliferation in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2059740732,"Subclinical endotoxemia has been reported in HIV-1 infected persons and may drive systemic immune activation and pathogenesis. Proinflammatory responsiveness to endotoxin (LPS) is mediated by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). We therefore examined the association between plasma LPS levels, HIV RNA, and TLR4 expression and cytokine responses in the blood of HIV infected and uninfected participants in a cohort of female sex-workers in Kenya.Ex vivo plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were assessed for LPS and TLR mRNA, respectively. The effects of HIV single stranded RNA, a TLR8 ligand, on TLR4 and LPS signaling were further assessed in short term PBMC culture. Both HIV uninfected and infected subjects frequently had low detectable LPS levels in their plasmas. Significantly increased LPS levels were associated with chronic HIV-1 infection, both treated and untreated, but not with other acute or semi-chronic conditions reported. In HIV-uninfected subjects, TLR4 mRNA expression levels correlated inversely with plasma LPS levels, suggesting chronic endotoxin 'tolerance' in vivo. A similar effect of reduced TLR4 mRNA was seen in short term PBMC culture after stimulation with LPS. Interestingly, the apparent in vivo tolerance effect was diminished in subjects with HIV infection. Additionally, pre-stimulation of PBMC with LPS lead to proinflammatory (TNF-alpha) tolerance to subsequent LPS stimulation; however, pre-treatment of PBMC with HIV single-stranded RNA40, could enhance TLR4-mediated LPS responsiveness in vitro.Thus, dysregulation of endotoxin tolerance by HIV-1 RNA may exacerbate HIV chronic immune activation and pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2023334359,"Tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs) comprise a large family of membrane receptors that regulate various cellular processes in cell biology of diverse organisms. We previously described an atypical RTK in the platyhelminth parasite Schistosoma mansoni, composed of an extracellular Venus flytrap module (VFT) linked through a single transmembrane domain to an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain similar to that of the insulin receptor.Here we show that this receptor is a member of a new family of RTKs found in invertebrates, and particularly in insects. Sixteen new members of this family, named Venus Kinase Receptor (VKR), were identified in many insects. Structural and phylogenetic studies performed on VFT and TK domains showed that VKR sequences formed monophyletic groups, the VFT group being close to that of GABA(B) receptors and the TK one being close to that of insulin receptors. We show that a recombinant VKR is able to autophosphorylate on tyrosine residues, and report that it can be activated by L-arginine. This is in agreement with the high degree of conservation of the alpha amino acid binding residues found in many amino acid binding VFTs. The presence of high levels of vkr transcripts in larval forms and in female gonads indicates a putative function of VKR in reproduction and/or development.The identification of RTKs specific for parasites and insect vectors raises new perspectives for the control of human parasitic and infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2154379350,"Mucin-type O-gly co sy la tion is initiated by a large family of UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGalNAc Ts) that transfer GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc to the Ser and Thr residues of polypeptide acceptors. Some members of the family prefer previously gly co sylated peptides (ppGalNAc T7 and T10), whereas others are inhibited by neighboring gly co sy la tion (ppGalNAc T1 and T2). Characterizing their peptide and glycopeptide substrate specificity is critical for understanding the biological role and significance of each isoform. Utilizing a series of random peptide and glycopeptide substrates, we have obtained the peptide and glycopeptide specificities of ppGalNAc T10 for comparison with ppGalNAc T1 and T2. For the glycopeptide substrates, ppGalNAc T10 exhibited a single large preference for Ser/Thr-O-GalNAc at the +1 (C-terminal) position relative to the Ser or Thr acceptor site. ppGalNAc T1 and T2 revealed no significant enhancements suggesting Ser/Thr-O-GalNAc was inhibitory at most positions for these isoforms. Against random peptide substrates, ppGalNAc T10 revealed no significant hydrophobic or hydrophilic residue enhancements, in contrast to what has been reported previously for ppGalNAc T1 and T2.

For example, in Drosophila four isoforms have close sequence orthologues to the mammalian transferases.

Historically, the major targets of the ppGalNAc Ts have been thought to be heavily O-glycosylated mucin domains of membrane and secreted glycoproteins. Such domains typically contain 15–30% Ser or Thr, which are highly (>50%) substituted by GalNAc. One question in the field is as follows. How is this high degree of peptide core glycosylation achieved and is it related to the large number of ppGalNAc isoforms, some of which may even have specific mucin domain preferences? Interestingly, some members of the ppGalNAc T family are known to prefer substrates that have been previously modified with O-linked GalNAc on nearby Ser/Thr residues, hence having so-called glycopeptide or filling-in activities, i.e. ppGalNAc T7 and T10 (8Ten Hagen K.G.

These latter transferases have been called early or initiating transferases, preferring nonglycosylated over-glycosylated substrates. Presently, little is known about which factors dictate the different peptide/glycopeptide specificities among the ppGalNAc Ts. The ppGalNAc Ts consist of an N-terminal catalytic domain tethered by a short linker to a C-terminal ricin-like lectin domain containing three recognizable carbohydrate-binding sites (36Hazes B. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1490-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Because ppGalNAc T7 and T10 prefer to transfer GalNAc to glycopeptide acceptors, it has been widely assumed that their C-terminal lectin domains would play significant roles in this activity, as has been demonstrated for other family members (27Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Hollingsworth M.A. Clausen H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 28Cheng L. Tachibana K. Zhang Y. Guo J. Kahori Tachibana K. Kameyama A. Wang H.

Furukawa S. Sawaki H. Kato R. Wakatsuki S. Narimatsu H. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 708-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) solved the crystal structure of ppGalNAc T10 in complex with Ser-GalNAc specifically bound to its lectin domain. In this work (37Kubota T. Shiba T. Sugioka S. Furukawa S. Sawaki H. Kato R. Wakatsuki S. Narimatsu H. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 708-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the authors further demonstrated that a T10 lectin domain mutant indeed had altered specificity against GalNAc-containing glycopeptide substrates when the acceptor Ser/Thr site was distal from the pre-existing glycopeptide GalNAc site. However, it was also observed that the lectin mutant still possessed relatively unaltered glycopeptide activity when the acceptor Ser/Thr site was directly N-terminal of a pre-existing glycopeptide GalNAc site. Kubota et al. (37Kubota T. Shiba T. Sugioka S. Furukawa S. Sawaki H. Kato R. Wakatsuki S. Narimatsu H. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 708-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) therefore concluded that for ppGalNAc T10, both its lectin and indeed its catalytic domain must contain distinct peptide GalNAc recognition sites. In support of this, Raman et al. (33Raman J. Fritz T.A. Gerken T.A. Jamison O. Live D. Liu M. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22942-22951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have shown that the complete removal of the ppGalNAc T10 lectin domain only slightly alters its specificity against distal glycopeptide substrates while showing no difference in its ability to glycosylate residues directly N-terminal of an existing site of glycosylation. Thus, it seems that the catalytic domain of ppGalNAc T10 may have specific requirements for a peptide O-linked GalNAc in at least the +1 position (toward the C terminus) of residues being glycosylated. As no systematic determination of the glycopeptide binding properties of the ppGalNAc Ts catalytic domain has been performed, it is unknown whether additional GalNAc peptide-binding sites exist in T10 or, for that matter, any of the other ppGalNAc Ts. We have recently reported the use of oriented random peptide substrates, GAGA(X)nT(X)nAGAGK (where X indicates randomized amino acid positions and n = 3 and 5) for determining the peptide substrate specificities of mammalian ppGalNAc T1, T2, and their fly orthologues (21Gerken T.A. Ten Hagen K.G. Jamison O. Glycobiology. 2008; 18: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 38Gerken T.A. Raman J. Fritz T.A. Jamison O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32403-32416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the present work, we extend this approach to the determination of the catalytic domain glycopeptide (Ser/Thr-O-GalNAc) substrate preferences for ppGalNAc T1, T2, and T10 employing two n = 4 oriented random glycopeptide libraries (Table 1). The first library has Ser-O-GalNAc and other amino acids in the random “X” regions (GP-I), and the second library has a central Thr-O-GalNAc with nonglycosylated Ser and other amino acid residues in the random X regions (GP-II). From these two complementary random glycopeptides, and the use of the azido-labeled UDP-GalNAc analogue UDP-GalNAz, we have obtained the first systematic determination of the glycopeptide preferences of the catalytic domains of the ppGalNAc T1, T2, and T10. We observe that ppGalNAc T10 has a large and pronounced preference for Ser/Thr-O-GalNAc only at the +1 position from the acceptor site, whereas T1 and T2 have significantly reduced and variable preferences for Ser/Thr-O-GalNAc. We have also obtained preferences of ppGalNAc T10 against the n = 5 random peptide substrates for comparison with ppGalNAc T1 and T2 (21Gerken T.A. Ten Hagen K.G. Jamison O. Glycobiology. 2008; 18: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ppGalNAc T10 displays few significant enhancements and specifically lacks the Pro residue enhancements observed for ppGalNAc T1 and T2. These findings further demonstrate the vast substrate diversity of the catalytic domains of the ppGalNAc T family of transferases.TABLE 1ppGalNAc transferase random substrates utilized in this workPeptideSequenceNo. of unique sequencesGAGAXXXXXTXXXXXAGAGKP-VIX = G, A, P, V, L, Y, E, Q, R, H10 × 109P-VIIX = G, A, P, I, M, F, D, N, R, K10 × 109GAGAXXXXTXXXXAGAGGP-IX = G, A, P, V, I, F, Y, E, D, N, R, K, H, and Ser-O-α-GalNAc1.47 × 109GAGAXXXX(Thr-O-α-GalNAc)XXXXAGAGGP-IIX = G, A, P, V, I, F, Y, E, D, N, R, K, H, S1.47 × 109 Open table in a new tab Soluble recombinant bovine ppGalNAc T1 was a gift of Ake Elhammer (Kalamazoo, MI).

Random glycopeptides (GP-I), GAGAXXXX(T)XXXXAGAG, where X = Gly, Ala, Pro, Val, Ile, Phe, Tyr, Glu, Asp, Asn, Arg, Lys, His, and Ser-O-GalNAc and (GP-II), GAGAXXXX(Thr-O-GalNAc)XXXXAGAG, where X = Gly, Ala, Pro, Val, Ile, Phe, Tyr, Glu, Asp, Asn, Arg, Lys, His, and Ser were custom-synthesized by Bachem Americas (King of Prussia, PA). All peptide substrates were adjusted to pH ∼7.5 with dilute NaOH and/or HCl and lyophilized multiple times from water prior to use. UDP-[3H]GalNAc and UDP-[14C]GalNAc were purchased from ARC Inc. (St. Louis, MO). GalNAc-binding immobilized lectins SJA (Sophoro japonica), SBA (Glycine max), and HPA (Helix pomatia) were obtained from EY Laboratories (San Mateo, CA); immobilized VVA (Vicia villosa) was acquired from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Sephadex G-10 and Dowex (1X8) ion-exchange resin (100–200 mesh) were supplied from GE Healthcare and Organics, respectively. Liquid scintillation counting was performed on a Beckman model LS5801. The glycosylation of random peptides P-VI and P-VII was performed as described previously (21Gerken T.A. Ten Hagen K.G. Jamison O. Glycobiology. 2008; 18: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 38Gerken T.A. Raman J. Fritz T.A. Jamison O. J. Biol.

Reactions consisted of 2–4 mm UDP-GalNAc (3H- or 14C-labeled, 0.01 μCi/μl), ∼0.24 mg/ml ppGalNAc T10, and 22–45 mm random peptide substrates P-VI or P-VII, with final volumes of 53–200 μl. Based on radiolabel incorporation, less than 2% of either peptide was glycosylated after overnight incubation at 37 °C. Isolation of the glycosylated peptide was performed via mixed bed lectin column chromatography as described previously in Gerken et al. (21Gerken T.A. Ten Hagen K.G. Jamison O. Glycobiology. 2008; 18: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). GalNAc-eluted fractions were pooled based on 3H/14C content, lyophilized, and chromatographed on Sephadex G-10. Glycopeptide fractions were pooled and sequenced as described (21Gerken T.A. Ten Hagen K.G. Jamison O. Glycobiology. 2008; 18: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). (See comments in the supplemental material on the presence of N-deacetylated UDP-[3H]GalNAc label.) Glycosylation reactions consisted of 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mm MnCl2, protease inhibitor mixtures P8340 and P8849 (1:100 dilution), 0.1–1.5 mm UDP-GalNAz, trace UDP-[3H]GalNAc (0.01 μCi/μl), 0.071–0.25 mg/ml transferases, and 18–24 mm random glycopeptide (GP-I). Reactions were incubated overnight at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of a 2× volume of 250 mm EDTA. UDP, nonhydrolyzed UDP-[3H]GalNAc, and GalNAz were removed by passage over Dowex 1X8 anion-exchange columns. The eluant was lyophilized and chromatographed on a Sephadex G-10 column (0.7 × 113 cm) in 50 mm acetic acid buffer, pH 4.5, with NH4OH. Fractions were monitored for absorbance at 220 and 280 nm and incorporation of radioactivity by scintillation counting. Based on radiolabel incorporation of [3H]GalNAc, rough estimates of GP-I glycosylation by GalNAz ranged from ∼2 to 4%, assuming equal transfer rates. Tracer radiolabeled glycopeptide fractions were pooled based on absorbance and 3H content and lyophilized. Briefly, lyophilized glycopeptide G-10 fractions (0.045–0.11 μmol) were dissolved in 75 μl of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8. Alkyne-biotin (supplemental Fig. S4C) (1.3 mm), tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (2 mm), and tris-(benzyltriazolylmethyl)amine (1 mm) were then added to the peptide solution (final concentrations in 100 μl given in parentheses). After the mixture was vortexed for 60 s, the solution was made 2 mm CuSO4 and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The reaction products were chromatographed on a Sephadex G-10 column in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 6.5, to reduce hydrolysis (see supplemental Methods and Results). Fractions were monitored for absorbance at 220 and 280 nm and for the 3H radiolabel (Fig. 2A). Glycopeptide fractions were pooled as described above and lyophilized. The structure of the biotinylated GalNAz-GP-I product is given in supplemental Fig. S4D. Immobilized monomeric avidin (Pierce) (1-ml gel-bed volume) was prepared for use following the supplier's recommendations. Following equilibration with phosphate-buffered saline (0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.0), the G-10 isolated biotinylated GP-I was applied to the column and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 min. The column was washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and bound biotinylated random glycopeptide was eluted with 2-mmd-biotin in phosphate-buffered saline. The biotin eluant was lyophilized and passed over Sephadex G-10 in 50 mm acetic acid buffer, pH 4.5; fractions were monitored for absorbance at 220 and 280 nm (see Fig. 2B). Biotinylated glycopeptide was detected by a standard ELISA approach (43Koldas M. Uras F. Thromb. Res. 2001; 102: 221-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) using a 96-well HB plate (Fisher). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, and the biotinylated glycopeptide was detected after incubation with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Pierce) and p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Aldrich). Absorbance at 405 nm was monitored on a VERSAMAX Microplate Reader (Sunnyvale, CA). Fractions containing the biotinylated product were pooled and lyophilized for Edman sequencing. The glycosylation of random glycopeptide GP-II was performed for ppGalNAc T10 initially as described previously for P-VI and P-VII using 2 mm3H-labeled UDP-GalNAc (0.01 μCi/μl) and ∼10 mm random glycopeptide substrate GP-II. Because of low 3H incorporation under the above conditions, glycosylations with ppGalNAc T1 and T2 were performed in the absence of unlabeled UDP-GalNAc using 2.5–5 μl of 3H-labeled UDP-GalNAc (1 μCi/μl) giving 0.125–0.250 μm UDP-GalNAc. Enzyme concentrations consisted of 0.36 mg/ml ppGalNAc T10 and ∼0.14 mg/ml ppGalNAc T1 or T2. After separation on a Sephadex G-10 column, fractions were pooled based on radioactivity and lyophilized, and portions were Edman sequenced. Random glycopeptide GP-II was ∼1.8% glycosylated by ppGalNAc T10 and less than ∼0.01% glycosylated by ppGalNAc T1 and T2 based on radiolabel incorporation. [3H]GalNAc incorporation at each random position was determined by scintillation counting of the collected Edman sequencer PTH product (see below). Pulsed liquid phase Edman amino acid sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems Procise 494 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) at a C18 PTH column temperature at 55 °C. Data analysis was performed based on methods developed earlier (38Gerken T.A. Raman J. Fritz T.A. Jamison O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9709-9719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Automatic integration errors were corrected by manual integration via cutting and weighing of the peaks. For the analysis of 3H content, the post-PTH conversion step at each cycle was re-directed to a fraction collector and submitted to scintillation counting. At least three independent experiments were performed for ppGalNAc T10 with P-VI and P-VII, and the data were averaged. Two independent experiments were performed for GP-I for each transferase, and the data were averaged accordingly. For GP-II, at least two different experiments were performed for each transferase.

https://openalex.org/W2163495810,"Monocytes are circulating macrophage and dendritic cell precursors that populate healthy and diseased tissue. In humans, monocytes consist of at least two subsets whose proportions in the blood fluctuate in response to coronary artery disease, sepsis, and viral infection. Animal studies have shown that specific shifts in the monocyte subset repertoire either exacerbate or attenuate disease, suggesting a role for monocyte subsets as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Assays are therefore needed that can selectively and rapidly enumerate monocytes and their subsets. This study shows that two major human monocyte subsets express similar levels of the receptor for macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSFR) but differ in their phagocytic capacity. We exploit these properties and custom-engineer magnetic nanoparticles for ex vivo sensing of monocytes and their subsets. We present a two-dimensional enumerative mathematical model that simultaneously reports number and proportion of monocyte subsets in a small volume of human blood. Using a recently described diagnostic magnetic resonance (DMR) chip with 1 microl sample size and high throughput capabilities, we then show that application of the model accurately quantifies subset fluctuations that occur in patients with atherosclerosis."

We demonstrate that an evolutionary approach, which is independent of functional annotation, has great potential as a tool for genome analysis. We chose the genome of a model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa as an example. Phylogenetic distribution of each predicted protein coding gene (PCG) in the N. crassa genome was used to classify genes into six mutually exclusive lineage specificity (LS) groups, i.e. Eukaryote/Prokaryote-core, Dikarya-core, Ascomycota-core, Pezizomycotina-specific, N. crassa-orphans and Others. Functional category analysis revealed that only approximately 23% of PCGs in the two most highly lineage-specific grouping, Pezizomycotina-specific and N. crassa-orphans, have functional annotation. In contrast, approximately 76% of PCGs in the remaining four LS groups have functional annotation. Analysis of chromosomal localization of N. crassa-orphan PCGs and genes encoding for secreted proteins showed enrichment in subtelomeric regions. The origin of N. crassa-orphans is not known. We found that 11% of N. crassa-orphans have paralogous N. crassa-orphan genes. Of the paralogous N. crassa-orphan gene pairs, 33% were tandemly located in the genome, implying a duplication origin of N. crassa-orphan PCGs in the past. LS grouping is thus a useful tool to explore and understand genome organization, evolution and gene function in fungi."
https://openalex.org/W2022653829,"Background Eukaryotic chromosomes end with telomeres, which in most organisms are composed of tandem DNA repeats associated with telomeric proteins. These DNA repeats are synthesized by the enzyme telomerase, whose activity in most human tissues is tightly regulated, leading to gradual telomere shortening with cell divisions. Shortening beyond a critical length causes telomere uncapping, manifested by the activation of a DNA damage response (DDR) and consequently cell cycle arrest. Thus, telomere length limits the number of cell divisions and provides a tumor-suppressing mechanism. However, not only telomere shortening, but also damaged telomere structure, can cause telomere uncapping. Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC) and its severe form Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson Syndrome (HHS) are genetic disorders mainly characterized by telomerase deficiency, accelerated telomere shortening, impaired cell proliferation, bone marrow failure, and immunodeficiency. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied the telomere phenotypes in a family affected with HHS, in which the genes implicated in other cases of DC and HHS have been excluded, and telomerase expression and activity appears to be normal. Telomeres in blood leukocytes derived from the patients were severely short, but in primary fibroblasts they were normal in length. Nevertheless, a significant fraction of telomeres in these fibroblasts activated DDR, an indication of their uncapped state. In addition, the telomeric 3′ overhangs are diminished in blood cells and fibroblasts derived from the patients, consistent with a defect in telomere structure common to both cell types. Conclusions/Significance Altogether, these results suggest that the primary defect in these patients lies in the telomere structure, rather than length. We postulate that this defect hinders the access of telomerase to telomeres, thus causing accelerated telomere shortening in blood cells that rely on telomerase to replenish their telomeres. In addition, it activates the DDR and impairs cell proliferation, even in cells with normal telomere length such as fibroblasts. This work demonstrates a telomere length-independent pathway that contributes to a telomere dysfunction disease."

https://openalex.org/W2026694995,"Pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) is associated with placenta pathology and poor pregnancy outcome but the mechanisms that control the malaria parasite expansion in pregnancy are still poorly understood and not amenable for study in human subjects. Here, we used a set of new tools to re-visit an experimental mouse model of pregnancy-induced malaria recrudescence, BALB/c with chronic Plasmodium berghei infection. During pregnancy 60% of the pre-exposed primiparous females showed pregnancy-induced malaria recrudescence and we demonstrated that the recrudescent P. berghei show an unexpected enhancement of the adherence to placenta tissue sections with a marked specificity for CSA. Furthermore, we showed that the intensity of parasitemia in primigravida was quantitatively correlated with the degree of thickening of the placental tissue and up-regulation of inflammation-related genes such as IL10. We also confirmed that the incidence of pregnancy-induced recrudescence, the intensity of the parasitemia peak and the impact on the pregnancy outcome decreased gradually from the first to the third pregnancy. Interestingly, placenta pathology and fetal impairment were also observed at low frequency among non-recrudescent females. Together, the data raise the hypothesis that recrudescent P. berghei displays selected specificity for the placenta tissue enabling on one hand, the triggering of the pathological process underlying PAM and on the other hand, the induction of PAM protection mechanisms that are revealed in subsequent pregnancies. Thus, by exploiting P. berghei pregnancy-induced recrudescence, this experimental system offers a mouse model to study the susceptibility to PAM and the mechanisms of disease protection in multigravida."

https://openalex.org/W2058944408,"Numerous endemic mammals, including dwarf elephants, goats, hippos and deers, evolved in isolation in the Mediterranean islands during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. Most of them subsequently became extinct during the Holocene. Recently developed high-throughput sequencing technologies could provide a unique tool for retrieving genomic data from these extinct species, making it possible to study their evolutionary history and the genetic bases underlying their particular, sometimes unique, adaptations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPALS FINDINGS: A DNA extraction of a approximately 6,000 year-old bone sample from an extinct caprine (Myotragus balearicus) from the Balearic Islands in the Western Mediterranean, has been subjected to shotgun sequencing with the GS FLX 454 platform. Only 0.27% of the resulting sequences, identified from alignments with the cow genome and comprising 15,832 nucleotides, with an average length of 60 nucleotides, proved to be endogenous.A phylogenetic tree generated with Myotragus sequences and those from other artiodactyls displays an identical topology to that generated from mitochondrial DNA data. Despite being in an unfavourable thermal environment, which explains the low yield of endogenous sequences, our study demonstrates that it is possible to obtain genomic data from extinct species from temperate regions."

In the past decades, microbial research to produce diols, e.g. 1,3-propanediol and 2,3-butanediol, were considerably expanded due to their versatile usages especially in polymer synthesis and as possible alternatives to fossil based feedstocks from the bioconversion of renewable natural resources. This study aimed to provide a new way for bacterial production of an acetylated diol, i.e. acetylbutanediol (ABD, 3,4-dihydroxy-3-methylpentan-2-one), by acetoin metabolism.When Bacillus pumilus ATCC 14884 was aerobically cultured in a chemically defined medium with acetoin as the sole carbon and energy source, ABD was produced and identified by gas chromatography--chemical ionization mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy.Although the key enzyme leading to ABD from acetoin has not been identified yet at this stage, this study proposed a new metabolic pathawy to produce ABD in vivo from using renewable resources--in this case acetoin, which could be reproduced from glucose in this study--making it the first facility in the world to prepare this new bio-based diol product."
https://openalex.org/W2060050015,"Background Investigations into the regulation and functional roles of kinases such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) increasingly rely on cellular assays. Currently, there are a number of bioluminescence-based assays, for example reporter gene assays, that allow the study of the regulation, activity, and functional effects of PKA in the cellular context. Additionally there are continuing efforts to engineer improved biosensors that are capable of detecting real-time PKA signaling dynamics in cells. These cell-based assays are often utilized to test the involvement of PKA-dependent processes by using H-89, a reversible competitive inhibitor of PKA. Principal Findings We present here data to show that H-89, in addition to being a competitive PKA inhibitor, attenuates the bioluminescence signal produced by Renilla luciferase (RLuc) variants in a population of cells and also in single cells. Using 10 µM of luciferase substrate and 10 µM H-89, we observed that the signal from RLuc and RLuc8, an eight-point mutation variant of RLuc, in cells was reduced to 50% (±15%) and 54% (±14%) of controls exposed to the vehicle alone, respectively. In vitro, we showed that H-89 decreased the RLuc8 bioluminescence signal but did not compete with coelenterazine-h for the RLuc8 active site, and also did not affect the activity of Firefly luciferase. By contrast, another competitive inhibitor of PKA, KT5720, did not affect the activity of RLuc8. Significance The identification and characterization of the adverse effect of H-89 on RLuc signal will help deconvolute data previously generated from RLuc-based assays looking at the functional effects of PKA signaling. In addition, for the current application and future development of bioluminscence assays, KT5720 is identified as a more suitable PKA inhibitor to be used in conjunction with RLuc-based assays.

However, the substantial role of these fibronectin receptors and their functional assignment in erythroid differentiation are not yet fully understood. Here, we investigated the effects of cell adhesion to fibronectin on erythroid differentiation using K562 human erythroid progenitor cells. Erythroid differentiation could be induced in K562 cells in suspension by stimulating with hemin. This hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation was highly accelerated when cells were induced to adhere to fibronectin by treatment with TNIIIA2, a peptide derived from tenascin-C, which has recently been found to induce β1-integrin activation. Another integrin activator, Mn2+, also accelerated hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation. Adhesive interaction with fibronectin via VLA-4 as well as VLA-5 was responsible for acceleration of the hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation in response to TNIIIA2, although K562 cells should have been lacking in VLA-4. Adhesion to fibronectin forced by TNIIIA2 causally induced VLA-4 expression in K562 cells, and this was blocked by the RGD peptide, an antagonist for VLA-5. The resulting adhesive interaction with fibronectin via VLA-4 strongly enhanced the hemin-stimulated activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, which was shown to serve as a signaling molecule crucial for erythroid differentiation. Suppression of VLA-4 expression by RNA interference abrogated acceleration of hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation in response to TNIIIA2. Thus, VLA-4 and VLA-5 may contribute to erythropoiesis at different stages of erythroid differentiation.

The ECM in the hematopoietic microenvironment is composed of various macromolecules, such as fibronectin (FN), collagens, laminins, and proteoglycans.

We previously found that FN, which provides scaffolding for the adhesion of various cell types, has an alternative functional site opposing cell adhesion (17Fukai F. Takahashi H. Habu Y. Kubushiro N. Katayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A 22-mer peptide derived from the 14th FN type III-like (FNIII) repeat of the FN molecule, termed FNIII14, strongly suppresses cell adhesion to FN by inhibiting the activation of β1-integrins including VLA-4 and VLA-5 (18Fukai F.

Conversely, we have recently found that tenascin (TN)-C, which is an anti-adhesive ECM protein (20Erickson H.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 21Fischer D. Brown-Lüdi M. Schulthess T. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has a functional site for stimulating cell adhesion to FN (22Saito Y. Imazeki H. Miura S. Yoshimura T. Okutsu H. Harada Y. Ohwaki T.

A 22-mer peptide derived from the FNIII repeat A2 in the TN-C molecule, termed TNIIIA2, can induce the conformational change necessary for functional activation of FN receptors through binding with syndecan-4 (22Saito Y. Imazeki H. Miura S. Yoshimura T. Okutsu H. Harada Y. Ohwaki T. Nagao O. Kamiya S. Hayashi R. Kodama H. Handa H. Yoshida T. Fukai F. J. Biol.

Bull. 2008; 31: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The active sites of FNIII14 and TNIIIA2 appear to be cryptic in the molecular structures of FN and TN-C but are exposed by conformational change through interaction with other ECM molecules or by processing with matrix metalloproteinase-2 (22Saito Y. Imazeki H. Miura S. Yoshimura T. Okutsu H. Harada Y. Ohwaki T. Nagao O. Kamiya S. Hayashi R. Kodama H. Handa H. Yoshida T. Fukai F. J. Biol.

Katayama T. Miyazaki K. Fukai F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7138-7144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, these functional sites found in FN and TN-C molecules, which act in opposition to their parental ECM proteins, may act as a negative feedback loop for preventing excessive cellular responses to these ECM proteins in biological processes with ECM rearrangement. In any case, FNIII14 and TNIIIA2 enable us to control, either negatively or positively, the adhesion of various cell types to FN. Various hematopoietic progenitor cell lines have been used in in vitro studies of hematopoietic differentiation. However, most hematopoietic progenitor cell lines are nonadherent, because their cell surface β1-integrins, including FN receptors, have impaired ligand-binding activity (25Davis G.E. Camarillo C.W. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 7138-7150PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ni H. Li A. Simonsen N. Wilkins J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7981-7987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to investigate the role of cell adhesion to FN in hematopoietic differentiation, their FN receptors must be activated. Since TNIIIA2 can induce activation of FN receptors in various hematopoietic progenitor cell lines (22Saito Y. Imazeki H. Miura S. Yoshimura T. Okutsu H. Harada Y. Ohwaki T. Nagao O. Kamiya S. Hayashi R. Kodama H. Handa H. Yoshida T. Fukai F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34929-34937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), this peptide factor may be useful for investigating the substantial role of cell adhesion to FN in hematopoietic differentiation. Here, we investigate the effects of cell adhesion to FN on erythroid differentiation using TNIIIA2 and Mn2+ as the integrin activator and the human erythroid progenitor cell line K562, which only expresses VLA-5, as the FN receptor (27Elices M.J. Osborn L. Takada Y. Crouse C. Luhowskyj S. Hemler M.E. Lobb R.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 577-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). As a result, we show that hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation of K562 cells is strongly enhanced when K562 cells are forced to adhere to FN. Sustained adhesion to FN via VLA-5, which is induced by TNIIIA2 or Mn2+, causes induction of VLA-4 expression. The resulting adhesive interaction with FN via newly expressed VLA-4 then generates a conspicuous increase in the hemin-stimulated phosphorylation/activation of p38 MAP kinase, which is shown to serve as a signaling molecule crucial for erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Synthetic peptides, such as CS-1 (LHPGEILDVPST), RGD (GRGDSP), TNIIIA2 (RSTDLPGLKAATHYTITIRGVC), and its control TNIIIA2scr (RSTDLPGLKAATHTVYRIGIC) (22Saito Y. Imazeki H. Miura S. Yoshimura T.

Hemin and 3,3-dimethoxybenzidine (o-dianisidine) were purchased from Sigma. K562 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamate (2 mm), kanamycin sulfate (60 μg/ml), amphotericin B (200 ng/ml), and NaHCO3 (10 mm). Cells were stimulated to induce erythroid differentiation by culture in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with hemin (50 μm) in the absence or presence of various factors to be tested. After culturing for the indicated periods, cells were washed and incubated with a solution containing o-dianisidine (0.04%) and hydrogen peroxide (0.3%) at room temperature for 1 h to stain hemoglobin-positive cells (29Minegishi N.

Hemoglobin-positive cells were counted microscopically at ×100 magnification in four different areas as differentiated cells. The total number of cells in the same area was similarly counted.

Briefly, cells (1 × 104) suspended in serum-free medium with or without Mn2+ (0.5 mm), FNIII14 or its control FNIII14scr, TNIIIA2 or its control TNIIIA2scr, and their combination were seeded in a 96-well plate coated with FN in the absence or presence of antagonists for VLA-4 and VLA-5, as indicated. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and then fixed with formalin. The total number of cells seeded into the well was counted microscopically at ×100 magnification in four different areas. After washing away the unadhered cells, the adhered cells in the same area were similarly counted. Data represent the percentage of the number of adhered cells relative to the total number of cells seeded into the well. The activation status of β1-integrins on the cell surface was evaluated by flow cytometric analysis, as described previously (22Saito Y. Imazeki H. Miura S. Yoshimura T. Okutsu H. Harada Y. Ohwaki T.

To determine the expression of integrin subunits during erythroid differentiation, cell suspension containing hemin (50 μm) with or without TNIIIA2 was cultured in the presence or absence of an antagonist for FN receptors. After culturing for the indicated period, cells were collected with PBS(−) containing 50 mm EDTA; washed; incubated with normal IgG, anti-integrin α4 mAb (P1H4), or α5 mAb (P1D6); and then incubated with FITC-labeled secondary Ab. The percentage of integrin-positive cells was determined by setting electronic gates to exclude 95% of positive cells (fluorescent) in the isotype controls.

The siRNAs were transfected into cells by using Transmessenger (Qiagen), and the cells were used for experiments 2 days after transfection. K562 cells are incapable of adhering to FN, because of their inactivated integrins (22Saito Y. Imazeki H. Miura S. Yoshimura T. Okutsu H. Harada Y. Ohwaki T. Nagao O. Kamiya S. Hayashi R. Kodama H.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3270-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) inhibited this Mn2+-induced K562 cell adhesion to FN, whereas FNIII14scr, which has a shuffled FNIII14 amino acid sequence (19Kamiya S.

Conversely, TNIIIA2 induced the adhesion of K562 cells to FN without Mn2+ in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). TNIIIA2scr, in which the active amino acid sequence of TNIIIA2 is shuffled (22Saito Y.

Chem. 2007; 282: 34929-34937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), had no proadhesive activity (Fig. 1A). These negative and positive modulations of K562 cell adhesion to FN by these peptides were due to their effects on the activation of β1-integrins. An active conformation-specific epitope of β1-integrin, which can be detected by mAb AG89 (28Takagi J. Isobe T. Takada Y. Saito Y. J. Biochem. 1997; 121: 914-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), was exposed by treating cells with TNIIIA2 (Fig. 1C, d) as well as Mn2+ (b) but buried by treatment with FNIII14 (c and e). TNIIIA2-induced adhesion of K562 cells to FN was reversed by the addition of VLA-5 antagonists, anti-α5 mAb, and RGD peptide (GRGDSP) but not by the addition of VLA-4 antagonists, anti-α4 mAb, and CS-1 peptide (Fig. 1B). Like most hematopoietic progenitor cell lines, K562 cells can grow in suspension without adhering to the ECM. To assess the effect of adhesion to FN on cellular differentiation of K562 cells, exponentially growing K562 cells were stimulated with hemin in the presence or absence of TNIIIA2. Erythroid differentiation was evaluated by counting the cells expressing hemoglobin. When K562 cells were cultured with hemin (50 μm) in the absence of TNIIIA2, nearly 40% of cells became hemoglobin-positive after culture for 3 days (Fig. 2, A (b) and B). Stimulation with hemin at higher concentrations did not cause a further increase in the proportion of hemoglobin-positive cells but reduced the viability of K562 cells (data not shown). Most cells remained unadhered throughout the stimulation with hemin. Next, erythroid differentiation of K562 cells was stimulated with hemin in the presence of TNIIIA2, in which cells were induced to adhere to the FN in response to TNIIIA2. As a result, a considerable number of hemoglobin-positive cells appeared after stimulation for only 1 day, and more than 70% of cells were hemoglobinized after culture for 3 days (Fig. 2, A (c) and B). Throughout the culture, most cells adhered to the FN substrate, indicating that TNIIIA2 is capable of maintaining the FN receptor activated for a long period. TNIIIA2 accelerated hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). TNIIIA2scr, which had no proadhesive activity (see Fig. 1A), could not accelerate hemin-stimulated differentiation (Fig. 3A). Mn2+, which induced K562 cell adhesion to FN (see Fig. 1A), was capable of accelerating hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation to a lesser extent than TNIIIA2 (Fig. 3A). Stimulation of cells with TNIIIA2 alone, without hemin, induced adhesion to FN but not hemoglobinization in K562 cells (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, FNIII14, which was capable of reversing forced adhesion of K562 cells induced by Mn2+ or TNIIIA2 (see Fig. 1A), alone showed no effect on the hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation of K562 cells in suspension (Fig. 3B). However, accelerated differentiation of K562 cells, which was stimulated by hemin in combination with TNIIIA2, was reversed by the addition of FNIII14, depending on its increased concentration (Fig. 3B). This decrease in erythroid differentiation by the addition of FNIII14 was accompanied by a decrease in the number of cells adhered to FN (data not shown). Thus, acceleration of hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation in response to TNIIIA2 resulted from adhesion of K562 cells to FN. We next investigated whether VLA-5, the only FN receptor expressed on K562 cells, contributed to the acceleration of hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation in response to TNIIIA2. As expected, acceleration of hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation in response to TNIIIA2 was attenuated by the addition of the RGD peptide, a VLA-5 antagonist (Fig. 3C), in which TNIIIA2-induced adhesion of K562 cells was also attenuated (data not shown). Unexpectedly, acceleration of hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation in response to TNIIIA2 was also reduced with the CS-1 peptide, a VLA-4 antagonist (Fig. 3C), although K562 cells should have been lacking in VLA-4 (27Elices M.J. Osborn L. Takada Y. Crouse C. Luhowskyj S. Hemler M.E. Lobb R.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 577-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the expression of integrin subunits and their changes during erythroid differentiation of K562 cells by flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 4). Consistent with general knowledge (27Elices M.J. Osborn L. Takada Y. Crouse C. Luhowskyj S. Hemler M.E. Lobb R.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 577-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar), K562 cells highly expressed integrin α5 (Fig. 4n) and β1 (data not shown), but barely expressed integrin α4 (Fig. 4d). No remarkable changes in the expression of α4 (Fig. 4, e and h) and β1 were observed during the hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation of K562 cells in suspension. When erythroid differentiation was stimulated by hemin under adhesive conditions (in the presence of TNIIIA2 or Mn2+) (see FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3), α4 became detectable 1 day after stimulation (Fig. 4, f for Mn2+ and g for TNIIIA2) and further increased remarkably 3 days after the stimulation (Fig. 4, i for Mn2+ and j for TNIIIA2). Induction of the α4 expression was detectable in K562 cells stimulated with TNIIIA2 alone without hemin (m), whereas this was not accompanied by hemoglobinization (Fig. 3, A and C). Induction of the α4 expression was abolished when erythroid differentiation was stimulated by hemin and TNIIIA2 in the presence of the RGD peptide (k). In contrast, the CS-1 peptide did not influence induction of the α4 expression (l), although it abrogated acceleration of hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation in response to TNIIIA2 (Fig. 3C). The integrin subunit β7 was not detected on K562 cells either before or after the stimulation with hemin and TNIIIA2 (data not shown), suggesting that integrin α4 is probably expressed as VLA-4 on K562 cell surfaces. To clarify the necessity of VLA-4 expression in the acceleration of hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation in response to TNIIIA2, K562 cells transfected with control siRNA or integrin α4 siRNA were subjected to examination for erythroid differentiation. Hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation was not influenced by transfection with α4 siRNA, whereas its acceleration in response to TNIIIA2 was markedly attenuated by transfection with α4 siRNA (Fig. 5A). In these cells, induction of α4 expression was strongly suppressed (Fig. 5B). K562 cells transfected with control siRNA, in which induction of the α4 expression was evident (Fig. 5B), normally underwent erythroid differentiation in response to hemin with or without TNIIIA2 (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that induction of VLA-4 expression is needed for the acceleration of hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Members of the MAP kinase family, such as ERK1/2, p38, and JNK, are reportedly involved in signaling for erythropoiesis (30Witt O. Sand K. Pekrun A. Blood. 2000; 95: 2391-2396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Whalen A.M. Galasinski S.C. Shapiro P.S. Nahreini T.S. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1947-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 32Nagata Y. Takahashi N. Davis R.J. Todokoro K. Blood. 1998; 92: 1859-1869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the MAP kinase involved in erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, we investigated phosphorylation of the MAP kinases during erythroid differentiation, as observed by immunoblotting using phospho-specific mAbs for MAP kinases. ERK1/2 showed no remarkable alteration in their phosphorylation during hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation (Fig. 6A). Phosphorylated JNK was barely detected in K562 cells cultured under the same conditions (data not shown). In contrast, a significant increase in p38 phosphorylation was detected in cells stimulated with hemin (Fig. 6A). Stimulation with TNIIIA2 alone did not influence the phosphorylation of p38, whereas stimulation with hemin in combination with TNIIIA2 resulted in a conspicuous increase in p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 6A). This conspicuous increase in p38 phosphorylation was completely prevented by pretreating cells with the CS-1 peptide (Fig. 6B), suggesting the implication of VLA-4 signaling in the adhesion-dependent increase in p38 phosphorylation. Supporting this, siRNA-based suppression of integrin α4 expression also blocked the conspicuous increase in p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 6C). The RGD peptide also abolished the increased phosphorylation of p38 (Fig. 6B), probably due to prevention of VLA-4 expression (see Fig. 4k). Like TNIIIA2, Mn2+ increased the hemin-stimulated phosphorylation of p38, to a lesser extent than TNIIIA2 (data not shown). The necessity of p38 phosphorylation in hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation and its adhesion-dependent acceleration was confirmed by siRNA-based down-regulation of p38. K562 cells were transfected with control siRNA or p38 siRNA. Expression of p38 was markedly down-regulated by p38 siRNA but hardly by control siRNA (Fig. 7A). Down-regulation of p38 expression by p38 siRNA resulted in abrogation of not only acceleration of the hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation in response to TNIIIA2 but also the differentiation stimulated by hemin alone. Transfection with control siRNA did not influence erythroid differentiation of K562 cells stimulated by hemin with or without TNIIIA2. In agreement with these results, pretreatment of K562 cells with SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38, but not with PD98059 and SP600125, inhibitors of MEK and JNK, respectively, reduced erythroid differentiation to the basal level (supplementalFig. 1). In the present study, we found that erythroid differentiation stimulated by hemin was greatly enhanced when K562 cells were induced to adhere to FN by activating VLA-5 with TNIIIA2 (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Since Mn2+, another integrin activator, was also capable of accelerating hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation (Fig. 3A) and since acceleration of hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation was inhibited by prevention of adhesion to FN (Fig. 3, B and C), it is conceivable that acceleration of the hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation is dependent on adhesion of K562 cells to FN. This adhesion-dependent acceleration of erythroid differentiation was abrogated by not only a VLA-5 antagonist (RGD peptide) but also a VLA-4 antagonist (CS-1 peptide) (Fig. 3C), although K562 cells should have been lacking in VLA-4. This conflict was explained by results showing that sustained adhesion to FN via VLA-5 causally induced VLA-4 expression in K562 cells (Fig. 4). In fact, this induction of VLA-4 expression was prevented with the RGD peptide, a VLA-5 antagonist (Fig. 4). Since adhesion-dependent acceleration of erythroid differentiation was blocked with the CS-1 peptide (Fig. 3C) and also by siRNA-based suppression of α4 expression (Fig. 5), it is conceivable that the induced VLA-4 plays an indispensable role in the adhesion-dependent acceleration of erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, newly expressed VLA-4 was shown to be involved in a conspicuous increase in p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 6), as discussed below. Thus, VLA-5 and VLA-4 were shown to contribute to erythropoiesis at different stages of erythroid differentiation; VLA-5 triggers the induction of VLA-4 expression, and the resulting VLA-4 positively modulates the activation of p38, a critical signaling molecule for erythroid differentiation. Several previous studies demonstrated that activation of p38 and/or JNK but not ERK is required for erythroid differentiation induced by butyrate (30Witt O. Sand K. Pekrun A. Blood. 2000; 95: 2391-2396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), erythropoietin (32Nagata Y. Takahashi N. Davis R.J. Todokoro K. Blood. 1998; 92: 1859-1869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), hydroxyurea (33Park J.I. Choi H.S. Jeong J.S. Han J.Y. Kim I.H. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 481-486PubMed Google Scholar), or hemin (34Di Pietro R. di Giacomo V. Caravatta L. Sancilio S. Rana R.A. Cataldi A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 100: 1070-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the present study, siRNA-based down-regulation of p38 (Fig. 7) and experiments using the specific inhibitor of p38 (supplementalFig. 1) demonstrated that the phosphorylation/activation of p38 plays a key role in the hemin-stimulated erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Additionally, induced adhesion of K562 cells to FN with TNIIIA2 or Mn2+ conspicuously increased the hemin-generated phosphorylation of p38 (Fig. 6A), and this increased phosphorylation of p38 was reversed by suppression of α4 expression induction (Fig. 6C). The results suggest that VLA-4-mediated adhesion is responsible for a conspicuous increase in p38 phosphorylation/activation. However, since stimulation with TNIIIA2 or Mn2+ without hemin was incapable of generating p38 activation and also hemoglobinization, cell adhesion to FN is not sufficient per se for erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Integrin-mediated adhesion appears to accelerate supportively, not induce directly, erythroid differentiation. Further study is required for an understanding of the molecular mechanism by which VLA-4-mediated adhesion to FN can generate a conspicuous activation of p38 in concert with hemin. With regard to the induction of integrin expression during differentiation of K562 cells, Zutter et al. (35Zutter M.M. Fong A.M. Krigman H.R. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20233-20238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that megakaryocytic differentiation is accompanied by expression of integrin α2β1, a collagen receptor. In contrast to the erythroid differentiation observed here, induction of α2 integrin expression contributes to the acquisition of the ability to adhere to collagen. Expression of the α2 gene requires signaling via the MAP kinase pathway to activate two tandem AP1-binding sites in the α2 integrin enhancer (36Zutter M.M. Painter A.D. Yang X. Blood. 1999; 93: 1600-1611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of the MAP kinase cascade with PD98059, a MEK inhibitor, prevented the expression of α2 integrin in cells induced to become megakaryocytic. TN-C is highly expressed by the stromal cells of the hematopoietic system or lymphoid organs, particularly in the microenvironment surrounding the maturing hematopoietic cells (37Chilosi M. Lestani M. Benedetti A. Montagna L. Pedron S. Scarpa A. Menestrina F. Hirohashi S. Pizzolo G. Semenzato G. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1348-1355PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ocklind G. Talts J. Fässler R. Mattsson A. Ekblom P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 1163-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 39Klein G. Beck S. Müller C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1027-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a study of TN-C gene-deficient mice showed that TN-C-deficient mice retain their capacity for hematopoiesis, whereas the extent of the colony-forming capacity of hematopoietic progenitor cells and production of hematopoietic cells in long term bone marrow cultures of TN-C-deficient mice are significantly lower than in those of TN-C-expressing control mice (40Ohta M. Sakai T. Saga Y. Aizawa S. Saito M. Blood. 1998; 91: 4074-4083PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, TN-C is considered to play a supportive role in hematopoiesis, similar to the role of TNIIIA2 in erythroid differentiation. On the other hand, there have been many studies indicating that the ECM proteins, including TN-C, have biologically active cryptic sites, so-called “matricryptic sites” (41Davis G.E. Bayless K.J. Davis M.J. Meininger G.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1489-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). These matricryptic sites can be exposed through biological processes, such as conformational change in response to interaction with cells or other ECM components and processing with the ECM-degrading proteinases that are secreted by cells of hematopoietic origin, including hematopoietic stromal cells and mononuclear cells (22Saito Y.

It is important to ascertain if the TNIIIA2-related matricryptic site(s) is actually exposed in the microenvironment of the hematopoietic system. Recently, Seki et al. (46Seki M. Kameoka J. Takahashi S. Harigae H. Yanai N. Obinata M. Sasaki T. Exp. Hematol. 2006; 34: 519-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) have identified TN-C as a key molecule promoting stromal cell-dependent erythropoiesis, as judged by hemoglobin-positive erythroid colony formation from fetal liver cells of mice. They demonstrated that siRNA-based down-regulation of TN-C suppresses the erythroid colony formation, and conversely, the addition of exogenous TN-C increases formation in stromal cell lines. Although the active site(s) of the TN-C molecule has not been determined in their study, it may be possible that the TNIIIA2-related functional site on the TN-C molecule is involved in erythroid colony formation. It is also important to ascertain if adhesion-dependent acceleration of erythroid differentiation observed here using K562 cells and hemin is valid for erythroid development in vivo. A study on the effect of TNIIIA2 on erythroid colony formation is now under way. Download .pdf (.43 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2043716231,"In plants oxygenic photosynthesis is performed by large protein complexes found in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. The soluble thylakoid lumen space is a narrow and compressed region within the thylakoid membrane which contains 80–200 proteins. Because the thylakoid lumen proteins are in close proximity to the protein complexes of photosynthesis, it is reasonable to assume that the lumen proteins are highly influenced by the presence of light. To identify light regulated proteins in the thylakoid lumen of Arabidopsis thaliana we developed a faster thylakoid preparation and combined this with difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) of dark-adapted and light-adapted lumen proteomes. The DIGE experiments revealed that 19 lumen proteins exhibit increased relative protein levels after eight hour light exposure. Among the proteins showing increased abundance were the PsbP and PsbQ subunits of Photosystem II, major plastocyanin and several other proteins of known or unknown function. In addition, co-expression analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data showed that the co-regulation of lumen protein expression is not limited to light but rather that lumen protein genes exhibit a high uniformity of expression. The large proportion of thylakoid lumen proteins displaying increased abundance in light-adapted plants, taken together with the observed uniform regulation of transcription, implies that the majority of thylakoid lumen proteins have functions that are related to photosynthetic activity. This is the first time that an analysis of the differences in protein level during a normal day/night cycle has been performed and it shows that even a normal cycle of light significantly influences the thylakoid lumen proteome. In this study we also show for the first time, using co-expression analysis, that the prevalent lumenal chloroplast proteins are very similarly regulated at the level of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1985780232,"There is evidence that many abstract concepts are represented cognitively in a spatial format. However, it is unknown whether similar spatial processes are employed in different knowledge domains, or whether individuals exhibit similar spatial profiles within and across domains. This research investigated similarities in spatial representation in two knowledge domains – mathematics and music. Sixty-one adults completed analogous number magnitude and pitch discrimination tasks: the Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Codes and Spatial-Musical Association of Response Codes tasks. Subgroups of individuals with different response patterns were identified through cluster analyses. For both the mathematical and musical tasks, approximately half of the participants showed the expected spatial judgment effect when explicitly cued to focus on the spatial properties of the stimuli. Despite this, performances on the two tasks were largely independent. Consistent with previous research, the study provides evidence for the spatial representation of number and pitch in the majority of individuals. However, there was little evidence to support the claim that the same spatial representation processes underpin mathematical and musical judgments."
https://openalex.org/W2155254941,"Oncogenic activation of the PI3K signalling pathway plays a pivotal role in the development of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). A central node in PI3K downstream signalling is controlled by the serine-threonine kinase AKT1. A somatic mutation affecting residue E17 of the AKT1 gene has recently been identified in breast and colon cancer. The E17K change results in constitutive AKT1 activation, induces leukaemia in mice, and accordingly, may be therapeutically exploited to target the PI3K pathway. Assessing whether AKT1 is activated by somatic mutations in GBM is relevant to establish its role in this aggressive disease.We performed a systematic mutational analysis of the complete coding sequence of the AKT1 gene in a panel of 109 tumor GBM samples and nine high grade astrocytoma cell lines. However, no somatic mutations were detected in the coding region of AKT1.Our data indicate that in GBM oncogenic deregulation of the PI3K pathway does not involve somatic mutations in the coding region of AKT1."

Here we show that phosphorylation by protein kinase CK2 is required for CAPS activity. Dephosphorylation eliminated CAPS activity in reconstituting Ca(2+)-dependent vesicle exocytosis in permeable and intact PC12 cells. Ser-5, -6, and -7 and Ser-1281 were identified by mass spectrometry as the major phosphorylation sites in the 1289 residue protein. Ser-5, -6, and -7 but not Ser-1281 to Ala substitutions abolished CAPS activity. Protein kinase CK2 phosphorylated CAPS in vitro at these sites and restored the activity of dephosphorylated CAPS. CK2 is the likely in vivo CAPS protein kinase based on inhibition of phosphorylation by tetrabromo-2-benzotriazole in PC12 cells and by the identity of in vivo and in vitro phosphorylation sites. CAPS phosphorylation by CK2 was constitutive, but the elevation of Ca(2+) in synaptosomes increased CAPS Ser-5 and -6 dephosphorylation, which terminates CAPS activity. These results identify a functionally important N-terminal phosphorylation site that regulates CAPS activity in priming vesicle exocytosis."

Sputum pretreatment procedures may enhance sensitivity. We did a pilot study to compare the diagnostic accuracy and incremental yield of two short-duration (<1 hour) sputum pretreatment procedures to optimize direct smears among patients with suspected TB at a referral hospital in India.Blinded laboratory comparison of bleach and universal sediment processing (USP) pretreated centrifuged auramine smears to direct Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) and direct auramine smears and to solid (Loweinstein-Jensen (LJ)) and liquid (BACTEC 460) culture. 178 pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB suspects were prospectively recruited during a one year period. Thirty six (20.2%) were positive by either solid or liquid culture. Direct ZN smear detected 22 of 36 cases and direct auramine smears detected 26 of 36 cases. Bleach and USP centrifugation detected 24 cases each, providing no incremental yield beyond direct smears. When compared to combined culture, pretreated smears were not more sensitive than direct smears (66.6% vs 61.1 (ZN) or 72.2 (auramine)), and were not more specific (92.3% vs 93.0 (ZN) or 97.2 (auramine).Short duration sputum pretreatment with bleach and USP centrifugation did not increase yield as compared to direct sputum smears. Further work is needed to confirm this in a larger study and also determine if longer duration pre-treatment might be effective in optimizing smear microscopy for TB."
https://openalex.org/W2028539415,"It is thought that changes in mitochondrial DNA are associated with many degenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and diabetes. Much of the evidence, however, depends on correlating disease states with changing levels of heteroplasmy within populations of mitochondrial genomes, rather than individual mitochondrial genomes. Thus these measurements are likely to either overestimate the extent of heteroplasmy due to technical artifacts, or underestimate the actual level of heteroplasmy because only the most abundant changes are observable. In contrast, Single Molecule (SM) LATE-PCR analysis achieves efficient amplification of single-stranded amplicons from single target molecules. The product molecules, in turn, can be accurately sequenced using a convenient Dilute-'N'-Go protocol, as shown here. Using these novel technologies we have rigorously analyzed levels of mitochondrial genome heteroplasmy found in single hair shafts of healthy adult individuals. Two of the single molecule sequences (7% of the samples) were found to contain mutations. Most of the mtDNA sequence changes, however, were due to the presence of laboratory contaminants. Amplification and sequencing errors did not result in mis-identification of mutations. We conclude that SM-LATE-PCR in combination with Dilute-'N'-Go Sequencing are convenient technologies for detecting infrequent mutations in mitochondrial genomes, provided great care is taken to control and document contamination. We plan to use these technologies in the future to look for age, drug, and disease related mitochondrial genome changes in model systems and clinical samples."
https://openalex.org/W2006487227,"Background A key event in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) is the conversion of the soluble, protease-sensitive glycosylated prion protein (PrPC) to an abnormally structured, aggregated and partially protease-resistant isoform (PrPSc). Both PrP isoforms bear two potential glycosylation sites and thus in a typical western blot with an anti-PrP antibody three distinct bands appear, corresponding to the di-, mono- or unglycosylated forms of the protein. The relative intensity and electrophoretic mobility of the three bands are characteristic of each TSE strain and have been used to discriminate between them. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study we used lectin-based western blotting to evaluate possible variations in composition within sugar chains carried by PrPSc purified from subjects affected with different TSEs. Our findings indicate that in addition to the already well-documented differences in electrophoretic mobility and amounts of the glycosylated PrPSc forms, TSE strains also vary in the abundance of specific N-linked sugars of the PrPSc protein. Conclusions/Significance These results imply that PrP glycosylation might fine-tune the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc and could play an accessory role in the appearance of some of the characteristic features of TSE strains. The differences in sugar composition could also be used as an additional tool for discrimination between the various TSEs."
