An experiment on human volunteers playing an economic game looked at the conditional nature of our sympathy, and the results show that fairness of social interactions is key to the empathic neural response. Both men and women empathized with the pain of cooperative people. But if people are selfish, empathic responses were absent, at least in men. And it seems that physical harm might even be considered a good outcome — perhaps the first neuroscientific evidence for schadenfreude. The neural processes underlying empathy are a subject of intense interest within the social neurosciences1,2,3. However, very little is known about how brain empathic responses are modulated by the affective link between individuals. We show here that empathic responses are modulated by learned preferences, a result consistent with economic models of social preferences4,5,6,7. We engaged male and female volunteers in an economic game, in which two confederates played fairly or unfairly, and then measured brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging while these same volunteers observed the confederates receiving pain. Both sexes exhibited empathy-related activation in pain-related brain areas (fronto-insular and anterior cingulate cortices) towards fair players. However, these empathy-related responses were significantly reduced in males when observing an unfair person receiving pain. This effect was accompanied by increased activation in reward-related areas, correlated with an expressed desire for revenge. We conclude that in men (at least) empathic responses are shaped by valuation of other people's social behaviour, such that they empathize with fair opponents while favouring the physical punishment of unfair opponents, a finding that echoes recent evidence for altruistic punishment."

The islands are arranged such that the dipole interactions create a two-dimensional analogue to spin ice. Images of the magnetic moments of individual elements in this correlated system allow us to study the local accommodation of frustration. We see both ice-like short-range correlations and an absence of long-range correlations, behaviour which is strikingly similar to the lowtemperature state of spin ice. These results demonstrate that artificial frustrated magnets can provide an uncharted arena in which the physics of frustration can be directly visualized."

An important question is the identity of first-order neurons initiating leptin's anti-obesity effects. A widely held view is that most, if not all, of leptin's effects are mediated by neurons located in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. However, leptin receptors (LEPRs) are expressed in other sites as well, including the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). The possible role of leptin acting in “nonarcuate” sites has largely been ignored. In the present study, we show that leptin depolarizes and increases the firing rate of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1)-positive neurons in the VMH. We also show, by generating mice that lack LEPRs on SF1-positive neurons, that leptin action at this site plays an important role in reducing body weight and, of note, in resisting diet-induced obesity. These results reveal a critical role for leptin action on VMH neurons. Leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone, acts directly on the brain to control food intake and energy expenditure.

Mice lacking leptin (Lepob/ob mice) or its receptor (Leprdb/db mice) are obese and diabetic (Bray and York, 1979Bray G.A. York D.A.

It is well established that leptin acts via the brain to cause its weight reducing actions (Halaas et al., 1997Halaas J.L. Boozer C. Blair-West J. Fidahusein N. Denton D.A. Friedman J.M.

Central nervous system (CNS)-specific deletion of LEPRs results in marked obesity (Cohen et al., 2001Cohen P. Zhao C. Cai X. Montez J.M. Rohani S.C. Feinstein P. Mombaerts P. Friedman J.M.

Leptin receptors (LEPRs) are abundantly expressed in several different sites within the hypothalamus, an area known to be important in regulating body weight. These sites include the arcuate (ARC), the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (DMH), the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) (Elmquist et al., 1998Elmquist J.K. Ahima R.S. Elias C.F. Flier J.S. Saper C.B. Leptin activates distinct projections from the dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The relative importance of leptin action at these different sites is unknown. Most models of leptin action in the brain give primary importance to neurons in the ARC. The ARC contains two populations of first-order, leptin-responsive neurons, specifically NPY/AGRP and POMC/CART neurons (Schwartz and Porte, 2005Schwartz M.W. Porte Jr., D. Diabetes, obesity, and the brain.Science. 2005; 307: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). NPY/AGRP neurons promote weight gain and are inhibited by leptin (Cowley et al., 2001Cowley M.A. Smart J.L. Rubinstein M. Cerdan M.G. Diano S. Horvath T.L. Cone R.D. Low M.J.

The widely held view of the importance of the ARC is based largely on indirect evidence, the essence of which is summarized here: (1) NPY/AGRP neurons and POMC/CART neurons express LEPRs; (2) neuropeptides that can affect energy homeostasis are released by these neurons (orexigenic neuropeptides, NPY and AGRP, from NPY/AGRP neurons and the anorexigenic neuropeptide, αMSH, from POMC/CART neurons); (3) deficiency of leptin or LEPRs causes changes in neuropeptide gene expression consistent with observed effects on body weight; and (4) leptin has acute electrophysiologic effects on these neurons consistent with its effects on body weight (Bjorbaek and Kahn, 2004Bjorbaek C.

Porte Jr., D. Diabetes, obesity, and the brain.Science. 2005; 307: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Such compelling, indirect evidence supporting a role for leptin action in the ARC, in the relative absence of evidence implicating a role for leptin action in other sites, has led to the assumption that most, if not all, of leptin's important effects on energy homeostasis are mediated by actions on NPY/AGRP neurons and POMC/CART neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Recently, we used Cre/lox conditional gene-knockout technology to generate mice lacking LEPRs on POMC neurons (Balthasar et al., 2004Balthasar N. Coppari R. McMinn J. Liu S.M. Lee C.E. Tang V. Kenny C.D. McGovern R.A. Chua Jr., S.C. Elmquist J.K. Lowell B.B. Leptin receptor signaling in POMC neurons is required for normal body weight homeostasis.Neuron. 2004; 42: 983-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Deletion of LEPRs on POMC neurons resulted in mild obesity. This is in stark contrast to the massive obesity observed in Leprdb/db mice, which lack LEPRs everywhere. From these results, we speculate that neurons in locations other than the ARC also contribute to the anti-obesity actions of leptin. One potentially important site for leptin action is the VMH. Evidence implicating this region includes the following: (1) destructive lesions of the VMH produce massive obesity (Hetherington and Ranson, 1940Hetherington A. Ranson S. Hypothalamic lesions and adiposity in the rat.Anat. Rec. 1940; 78: 149-172Crossref Scopus (473) Google Scholar), although the specificity of such lesions has been called into question (Gold, 1973Gold R.M. Hypothalamic obesity: the myth of the ventromedial hypothalamus.Science. 1973; 182: 488-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar); (2) gene-knockout mice deficient in steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1), a transcription factor expressed in the VMH, have abnormal VMH development (Dellovade et al., 2000Dellovade T.L. Young M. Ross E.P. Henderson R. Caron K. Parker K. Tobet S.A. Disruption of the gene encoding SF-1 alters the distribution of hypothalamic neuronal phenotypes.J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 423: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and are obese (Majdic et al., 2002Majdic G. Young M. Gomez-Sanchez E. Anderson P. Szczepaniak L.S. Dobbins R.L. McGarry J.D. Parker K.L. Knockout mice lacking steroidogenic factor 1 are a novel genetic model of hypothalamic obesity.Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar); (3) the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the deficiency of which causes obesity (Rios et al., 2001Rios M. Fan G. Fekete C. Kelly J. Bates B. Kuehn R. Lechan R.M. Jaenisch R. Conditional deletion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the postnatal brain leads to obesity and hyperactivity.Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1748-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), is nutritionally regulated in the VMH (Xu et al., 2003Xu B. Goulding E.H. Zang K. Cepoi D. Cone R.D. Jones K.R. Tecott L.H. Reichardt L.F. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor regulates energy balance downstream of melanocortin-4 receptor.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar); and (4) LEPRs are abundantly expressed in the VMH (Elmquist et al., 1998Elmquist J.K. Ahima R.S. Elias C.F. Flier J.S. Saper C.B. Leptin activates distinct projections from the dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and these LEPRs are readily engaged by peripheral leptin, as evidenced by induction of c-fos immunoreactivity and SOCS-3 mRNA (Bjorbaek et al., 1999Bjorbaek C. El-Haschimi K. Frantz J.D. Flier J.S. The role of SOCS-3 in leptin signaling and leptin resistance.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30059-30065Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, Elmquist et al., 1997Elmquist J.K. Ahima R.S. Maratos-Flier E. Flier J.S. Saper C.B. Leptin activates neurons in ventrobasal hypothalamus and brainstem.Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that leptin action on VMH neurons plays an important role in regulating energy homeostasis. To test the hypothesis that LEPRs on SF1 neurons mediate important actions of leptin, we generated mice lacking LEPRs exclusively on SF1 neurons. Phenotypic and electrophysiologic analyses of these mice permit us to directly test the importance of leptin action on SF1 neurons. Sf1-Cre transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase (Cre) in SF1 neurons were generated by engineering an Sf1 (approved mouse gene name, Nr5a1) bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) such that Cre expression is driven by Sf1 regulatory elements (Figure 1A). Several lines of Sf1-Cre transgenic mice were generated. To assess whether functional Cre protein was restricted to areas known to express SF1, we crossed all lines of Sf1-Cre mice with Z/EG Cre reporter mice (Tg [ACTBBgeo/GFP] 21Lbe stock# 003920; http://www.jaxmice.jax.org/). Z/EG Cre reporter mice express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) after Cre-mediated excision of a loxP-flanked lacZ gene (Novak et al., 2000Novak A. Guo C. Yang W. Nagy A. Lobe C.G. Z/EG, a double reporter mouse line that expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein upon Cre-mediated excision.Genesis. 2000; 28: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Lines of double-transgenic mice (henceforth referred to as Sf1-Cre, lox-GFP mice) were examined for eGFP expression in the CNS by immunohistochemical detection of GFP protein. Two lines (line 2 and 7) expressed Cre activity in a pattern mimicking that of Sf1 mRNA expression (Figures 1B and 1C). In the case of line 2, Cre activity was also noted in the cerebral cortex and in a few scattered cells in the caudal brainstem. Notably, LEPRs are not expressed in these neurons; therefore, Cre expression in these sites will be without effect. Cre activity was also observed in the pituitary, gonads and adrenals, tissues known to express SF1 (data not shown). Colocalization for Cre activity (immunohistochemical detection of GFP) and Sf1 mRNA expression (in situ hybridization) was performed to test whether Cre recombinase activity was restricted to SF1 neurons in the VMH (Figure 1D). A neuron was considered positive for Cre activity if the cell body and nucleus was clearly DAB labeled (orange-brown stain in Figure 1D). A GFP-positive neuron was considered “SF1 positive” if its cell body was decorated with at least ten black silver grains (3× above background). We identified 1000 VMH neurons that were GFP positive and scored these as either “SF1 positive” or “SF1 negative” in two series of brain sections from two Sf1-Cre, lox-GFP mice. Of these 1000 GFP-positive neurons, greater than 99% were SF1 positive. Thus, essentially all VMH neurons expressing Cre activity are SF1-positive neurons. We generated mice lacking LEPRs on SF1 neurons by first crossing mice homozygous for a loxP-modified Lepr allele (Leprflox/flox mice) (Balthasar et al., 2004Balthasar N. Coppari R. McMinn J. Liu S.M.

Genome. 2004; 15: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with Sf1-Cre mice. Leprflox/wt offspring from this cross were then bred with Sf1-Cre, Leprflox/wt littermates to generate Sf1-Cre, Leprflox/flox mice. The loxP modified Lepr allele was constructed such that loxP sequences flank exon 17 and 17′ of the Lepr allele. In the presence of Cre recombinase, a truncated nonfunctional LEPR-b protein is generated (LeprΔ17 allele). Indeed, mice homozygous for the deleted LeprΔ17 allele are phenotypically identical to Leprdb/db mice (Balthasar et al., 2004Balthasar N. Coppari R. McMinn J. Liu S.M. Lee C.E. Tang V. Kenny C.D.

Genome. 2004; 15: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To validate the loss of functional LEPRs exclusively on SF1 neurons in mice that are Sf1-Cre transgenic and homozygous for the loxP-modified Lepr allele (Sf1-Cre, Leprflox/flox mice), we acutely injected leptin and performed immunohistochemistry (IHCC) for phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (pSTAT3). Previous studies have shown that leptin binding to its receptor leads to induction of pSTAT3 in areas in the brain where LEPRs are present such as the hypothalamus and brainstem (Munzberg et al., 2003Munzberg H. Huo L. Nillni E.A. Hollenberg A.N. Bjorbaek C. Role of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in regulation of hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin gene expression by leptin.Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2121-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Therefore, pSTAT3 induction can be used as a functional assay for leptin activated cells. A single intraperitonal injection of leptin induced the expected pattern of pSTAT3 activation in Leprflox/flox mice, including prominent induction in the ARC, DMH, and the VMH (Figure 2C). Notably, leptin's ability to induce pSTAT3 in VMH neurons of Sf1-Cre, Leprflox/flox mice was markedly reduced (Figure 2D). Quantification of VMH pSTAT3 leptin-responsive cells in Leprflox/flox and Sf1-Cre, Leprflox/flox mice revealed an ∼80% reduction in the number of leptin-responsive cells in Sf1-Cre, Leprflox/flox mice (Figure 2E). pSTAT3 induction by leptin persisted in some VMH neurons of Sf1-Cre, Leprflox/flox mice. The majority of these neurons were located in the central subdivision of the VMH (cVMH) (Figure 2D) (Canteras et al., 1994Canteras N.S. Simerly R.B. Swanson L.W. Organization of projections from the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus: a Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin study in the rat.J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 348: 41-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). This is in contrast with the dorsomedial subdivision of the VMH (dmVMH), where nearly all pSTAT induction was lost in Sf1-Cre, Leprflox/flox mice (Figure 2D). The persistence of pSTAT3 induction in some VMH neurons of Sf1-Cre, Leprflox/flox mice could be explained by either incomplete inactivation of LEPRs on SF1-positive neurons or, alternatively, by expression of LEPRs on SF1-negative neurons. Unfortunately, antibodies suitable for SF1-protein detection in brain sections are unavailable. As an alternative approach toward addressing this issue, we performed double IHCC studies for Cre-dependent eGFP (used to indirectly detect SF1 neurons) and leptin-induced pSTAT3 in Sf1-Cre, lox-GFP, Leprwt/wt mice and in Sf1-Cre, lox-GFP, Leprflox/flox mice. As can be seen in “control” Sf1-Cre, lox-GFP, Leprwt/wt mice (Figures 2F, 2G, and 2H), the majority of pSTAT3-positive neurons in the dmVMH express GFP (presumed to be SF1-positive neurons). On the other hand, in “LEPR-deleted” Sf1-Cre, lox-GFP, Leprflox/flox mice (Figures 2I, 2J, and 2K), pSTAT3 induction in the dmVMH is greatly reduced, and the pSTAT3 that persists is located exclusively in neurons negative for GFP (presumed to be SF1-negative neurons). As in the dmVMH, persistent pSTAT3 in the cVMH of “LEPR-deleted” Sf1-Cre, lox-GFP, Leprflox/flox mice was also found to be located exclusively in neurons negative for GFP (presumed to be SF1-negative neurons) (data not shown). These findings suggest that persistent pSTAT3 activity in Sf1-Cre, lox-GFP Leprflox/flox mice is the result of leptin action on SF1-negative neurons. This interpretation of LEPRs being present on both SF1-positive and SF1-negative neurons in the VMH is strongly supported by our electrophysiological data (next section and Figure 3D), which demonstrate that most GFP-positive neurons (presumed to be SF1 positive) are activated by leptin (and never inhibited by leptin), whereas a significant proportion of GFP-negative neurons (presumed to be SF1 negative) are inhibited by leptin (32%). It has previously been shown in the ARC, that leptin activates POMC/CART neurons (depolarizes membrane potential and increases firing rate) and inhibits AGRP/NPY neurons (hyperpolarizes membrane potential and decreases firing rate) (Cowley et al., 2001Cowley M.A. Smart J.L. Rubinstein M. Cerdan M.G. Diano S. Horvath T.L. Cone R.D. Low M.J. Leptin activates anorexigenic POMC neurons through a neural network in the arcuate nucleus.Nature. 2001; 411: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar, van den Top et al., 2004van den Top M. Lee K. Whyment A.D. Blanks A.M. Spanswick D. Orexigen-sensitive NPY/AgRP pacemaker neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 493-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of leptin on SF1 neurons, we performed electrophysiologic recordings in the context of brain slices on GFP-labeled SF1 neurons from the dorsomedial subdivision of the VMH (dmVMH) of Sf1-Cre, lox-GFP, Leprwt/wt mice. These GFP-labeled SF1 neurons are henceforth referred to as “SF1-positive” neurons. In whole-cell recordings from these neurons, we observed a resting membrane potential of −40 to −50 mV along with frequent and spontaneous action potentials. These SF1-positive neurons displayed membrane depolarization and increased frequency of action potentials in the presence of leptin (representative tracing shown in Figure 3A). This response was observed in 14 of 17 SF1-positive neurons. We compared the leptin responsiveness of SF1-positive neurons to that of POMC-positive neurons from POMC-GFP transgenic mice generated in our laboratory. We found that the responses of SF1-positive neurons to leptin were similar to those of POMC-positive neurons, i.e., both types of neurons were depolarized, and both had an increased firing rate when exposed to leptin (data for POMC-positive neurons not shown). Thus, leptin activates both SF1-positive and POMC-positive neurons in the hypothalamus. We next assessed the electrophysiologic properties of SF1 neurons lacking LEPRs from Sf1-Cre, lox-GFP, Leprflox/flox mice. Basal activity of these neurons was similar to that of SF1-positive neurons of control mice (resting membrane potential: −47.7 ± 1.4 mV, Sf1-Cre, lox-GFP, Leprwt/wt versus −49.6 ± 1.3 mV Sf1-Cre, lox-GFP, Leprflox/flox; basal firing rate: 0.52 ± 0.09 Hz, Sf1-Cre, lox-GFP, Leprwt/wt versus 0.45 ± 0.06 Hz, Sf1-Cre, lox-GFP, Leprflox/flox). In contrast to SF1-positive neurons from control mice, leptin had no effect on either membrane potential or firing rate of SF1 neurons from Sf1-Cre, lox-GFP, Leprflox/flox mice (Figure 3B). In order to ensure that these neurons were viable, glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, was applied to SF1-positive neurons of Sf1-Cre, lox-GFP, Leprflox/flox mice. In all cases, glutamate depolarized and increased the firing rate of these SF1 neurons lacking LEPRs (data not shown). Leptin's effects on electrophysiologic properties of SF1 neurons with or without LEPRs are summarized in Figure 3C. Leptin depolarized (6.1 ± 1.0 mV) and increased the firing rate (2.12-fold ± 0.26-fold) of SF1 neurons in Sf1-Cre, lox-GFP, Leprwt/wt mice. These responses were not observed in SF1 neurons from Sf1-Cre, lox-GFP, Leprflox/flox mice, suggesting that SF1 neurons in the VMH are activated by leptin and that this activation is direct because it does not occur when LEPRs are deleted from SF1 neurons. We next determined if neurons in the VMH, both SF1-positive and SF1-negative neurons, respond homogeneously to leptin. To accomplish this, using the same protocol as for SF1-positive neurons, we recorded from SF1-negative (i.e., GFP-negative) neurons in the same dorsomedial subdivision of the VMH (dmVMH) of Sf1-Cre, lox-GFP, Leprwt/wt mice and compared these responses to those obtained from SF1-positive neurons. The SF1-negative neurons chosen for recording were those located in close proximity to SF1-positive neurons. In results summarized in Figure 3D, we observed that 56% of SF1-negative neurons were unresponsive to leptin (compare with 18% of SF1-positive neurons), 12% were activated by leptin (compare with 82% of SF1-positive neurons), and 32% were inhibited by leptin (compare with 0% of SF1-positive neurons). A representative trace showing inhibition by leptin is shown in Figure 3E. Thus, as is true for neurons in the ARC, neurons in the VMH are heterogeneous in their responses to leptin with SF1 neurons being activated by leptin and at least one population of SF1-negative neurons being inhibited by leptin. To determine the functional importance of LEPRs on SF1 neurons in body-weight regulation and to compare their relative importance to that of LEPRs on POMC neurons, we generated mice lacking LEPRs on SF1 neurons (Sf1-Cre, Leprflox/flox mice) and mice lacking LEPRs on POMC neurons (Pomc-Cre, Leprflox/flox mice). To rule out any potential nonspecific effects of the Sf1-Cre transgene by itself, or the insertion of loxP sites by themselves on body weight, we compared the body weights of Sf1-Cre mice and Leprflox/flox mice to those of wild-type littermates. The body weights of the three control groups, i.e., the Sf1-Cre, Leprwt/wt mice, Leprflox/flox mice and wild-type mice were similar in males (Figure 4A). Further, two control groups of female mice, namely Sf1-Cre, Leprwt/wt mice and Leprflox/flox mice, were also similar (Figure 4B). Thus, neither the Sf1-Cre transgene nor the lox-modified LEPR allele, by themselves, have any effect on body weight. Male and female Sf1-Cre, Leprflox/flox mice had significantly increased body weights compared to Leprflox/flox littermate controls (Figures 4A and 4B). At 20 weeks of age, Sf1-Cre, Leprflox/flox mice had a 15% increase in body weight over that seen in Leprflox/flox mice. This increase in body weight in Sf1-Cre, Leprflox/flox mice was similar to that observed in Pomc-Cre, Leprflox/flox mice (Figures 4A and 4B). The degree of obesity is approximately 20% of that seen in LeprΔ/Δ mice (on a similar genetic background), which have complete deletion of LEPRs in all neurons (Balthasar et al., 2004Balthasar N.

To ensure that the obese phenotype in Sf1-Cre, Leprflox/flox mice is specific to the loss of LEPRs on SF1 neurons and is unrelated to any effect caused by transgene insertion, we crossed a second line of Sf1-Cre mice (line 7) with Leprflox/flox mice. A similar increase in body weight was observed in this second line of Sf1-Cre, Leprflox/flox mice (Figure 4C). Thus, we conclude that LEPRs on SF1 neurons are required for normal body weight homeostasis and that leptin action on these neurons functions to restrain body weight gain. To determine whether deficiency of LEPRs on these two sites (SF1 and POMC neurons) has nonadditive, additive, or synergistic effects on body weight gain, we further generated mice lacking LEPRs on both SF1 and POMC neurons (Sf1-Cre, Pomc-Cre, Leprflox/flox mice). These mice were generated by crossing Sf1-Cre, Leprflox/flox with Pomc-Cre, Leprflox/flox mice. Littermates resulting from these crosses were used in studies described here. The double null mice, i.e., the Sf1-Cre, Pomc-Cre, Leprflox/flox mice, weighed significantly more than either of the single-transgenic Leprflox/flox mice. Loss of LEPRs on both SF1 and POMC neurons resulted in an additive effect on body weight (Figures 4A and 4B). The increased body weight with SF1 neuron-, POMC neuron-, or both SF1 and POMC neuron-specific deletion of LEPRS was not associated with any measurable increase in food intake (data not shown). This suggests that food intake is unaffected, or alternatively, that the effect is too small to be detected by the methods employed in"
https://openalex.org/W2078279227,"Our eyes move continually, even while we fixate our gaze on an object. If fixational eye movements are counteracted, our perception of stationary objects fades completely, due to neural adaptation. Some studies have suggested that fixational microsaccades refresh retinal images, thereby preventing adaptation and fading. However, other studies disagree, and so the role of microsaccades remains unclear. Here, we correlate visibility during fixation to the occurrence of microsaccades. We asked subjects to indicate when Troxler fading of a peripheral target occurs, while simultaneously recording their eye movements with high precision. We found that before a fading period, the probability, rate, and magnitude of microsaccades decreased. Before transitions toward visibility, the probability, rate, and magnitude of microsaccades increased. These results reveal a direct link between suppression of microsaccades and fading and suggest a causal relationship between microsaccade production and target visibility during fixation."
https://openalex.org/W2103225674,"The International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium (IHGSC) recently completed a sequence of the human genome. As part of this project, we have focused on chromosome 8. Although some chromosomes exhibit extreme characteristics in terms of length, gene content, repeat content and fraction segmentally duplicated, chromosome 8 is distinctly typical in character, being very close to the genome median in each of these aspects. This work describes a finished sequence and gene catalogue for the chromosome, which represents just over 5% of the euchromatic human genome. A unique feature of the chromosome is a vast region of approximately 15 megabases on distal 8p that appears to have a strikingly high mutation rate, which has accelerated in the hominids relative to other sequenced mammals. This fast-evolving region contains a number of genes related to innate immunity and the nervous system, including loci that appear to be under positive selection--these include the major defensin (DEF) gene cluster and MCPH1, a gene that may have contributed to the evolution of expanded brain size in the great apes. The data from chromosome 8 should allow a better understanding of both normal and disease biology and genome evolution."

The theoretical maximum tensile strain — that is, elongation — of a single-walled carbon nanotube is almost 20%1,2, but in practice only 6%3,4 is achieved. Here we show that, at high temperatures, individual single-walled carbon nanotubes can undergo superplastic deformation, becoming nearly 280% longer and 15 times narrower before breaking. This superplastic deformation is the result of the nucleation and motion of kinks in the structure, and could prove useful in helping to strengthen and toughen ceramics and other nanocomposites at high temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2031918610,"The sense of taste allows animals to distinguish nutritious and toxic substances and elicits food acceptance or avoidance behaviors. In Drosophila, taste cells that contain the Gr5a receptor are necessary for acceptance behavior, and cells with the Gr66a receptor are necessary for avoidance. To determine the cellular substrates of taste behaviors, we monitored taste cell activity in vivo with the genetically encoded calcium indicator G-CaMP. These studies reveal that Gr5a cells selectively respond to sugars and Gr66a cells to bitter compounds. Flies are attracted to sugars and avoid bitter substances, suggesting that Gr5a cell activity is sufficient to mediate acceptance behavior and that Gr66a cell activation mediates avoidance. As a direct test of this hypothesis, we inducibly activated different taste neurons by expression of an exogenous ligand-gated ion channel and found that cellular activity is sufficient to drive taste behaviors. These studies demonstrate that taste cells are tuned by taste category and are hardwired to taste behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2071121321,"In many parts of the oceans a layer known as a ‘deep chlorophyll maximum’ develops about 50 to 100 metres below the surface as various opposing forces achieve a balance. Phytoplankton sinking from surface waters and taking nutrients with them meet an upward flux of nutrients fuelling new growth at a depth where there is still sufficient light. These chlorophyll-rich layers play an important role in ocean productivity. A new study shows that reduced vertical mixing can induce oscillations and chaos in phytoplankton biomass and species composition in deep chlorophyll maxima via a mismatch in the time scales of the processes that create them. This runs counter to the widely held belief that deep chlorophyll maxima are stable features that track seasonal changes in light and nutrient conditions. Climate change scenarios predict that global warming will suppress vertical mixing in the oceans: this could destabilize the phytoplankton dynamics in the deep chlorophyll maximum, with implications for oceanic primary production, phytoplankton species composition, and carbon export. Deep chlorophyll maxima (DCMs) are widespread in large parts of the world's oceans1,2,3,4,5,6,7. These deep layers of high chlorophyll concentration reflect a compromise of phytoplankton growth exposed to two opposing resource gradients: light supplied from above and nutrients supplied from below. It is often argued that DCMs are stable features. Here we show, however, that reduced vertical mixing can generate oscillations and chaos in phytoplankton biomass and species composition of DCMs. These fluctuations are caused by a difference in the timescales of two processes: (1) rapid export of sinking plankton, withdrawing nutrients from the euphotic zone and (2) a slow upward flux of nutrients fuelling new phytoplankton production. Climate models predict that global warming will reduce vertical mixing in the oceans8,9,10,11. Our model indicates that reduced mixing will generate more variability in DCMs, thereby enhancing variability in oceanic primary production and in carbon export into the ocean interior."
https://openalex.org/W2125777593,"fMRI-based adaptation paradigms (fMR-A) have been used to infer neuronal stimulus selectivities in humans. Inferring neuronal selectivities from fMR-A, however, requires an understanding of the relationship between the stimulus selectivity of neuronal adaptation and responses. We studied this relationship by recording single cells in macaque inferior temporal (IT) cortex, an area that shows fMRI adaptation. Repetition of identical object images reduced the responsiveness of single IT neurons. Presentation of an image to which the neuron was unresponsive did not alter the response to a subsequent image that activated the neuron. Successive presentation of two different images to which the neuron responded similarly produced adaptation, but less so than the repeated presentation of an image. The neuronal adaptation at the single-cell level showed a greater degree of stimulus selectivity than the responses. This complicates the interpretation of fMR-A paradigms when inferring neuronal selectivity."

We show here that collapse induced by Slit2-conditioned medium (Slit2-CM) in Xenopus retinal growth cones requires local protein synthesis (PS) and endocytosis. Slit2-CM elicits rapid activation of translation regulators and MAP kinases in growth cones, and inhibition of MAPKs or disruption of heparan sulfate blocks Slit2-CM-induced PS and repulsion. Interestingly, Slit2-CM causes a fast PS-dependent decrease in cytoskeletal F-actin concomitant with a PS-dependent increase in the actin-depolymerizing protein cofilin. Our findings reveal an unexpected link between Slit2 and cofilin in growth cones and suggest that local translation of actin regulatory proteins contributes to repulsion."

Here, I used patch-clamp recordings in neuron pairs in rat olfactory bulb slices to assess the mechanisms underlying such “gamma” activity in the olfactory system. Patterned electrical stimulation of afferents that mimicked a natural odor stimulus elicited rapidly synchronized spikes (lag ≤ 5 ms) in mitral cells, along with oscillatory activity at the gamma (∼50 Hz) frequency. Analysis of coupling potentials, combined with dendritic sectioning, indicated that mitral cell synchrony was mainly driven by inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) imposed by GABAergic granule cells. Recordings in granule cell pairs indicated that granule cells were themselves synchronized by their excitatory inputs from mitral cells, providing a means to coordinate GABA release. These results demonstrate that rapid synchrony can emerge in a network through the precise back-and-forth interplay between neuronal populations."
https://openalex.org/W2110632114,"Dendritic spines show rapid motility and plastic morphology, which may mediate information storage in the brain. It is presently believed that polymerization/depolymerization of actin is the primary determinant of spine motility and morphogenesis. Here, we show that myosin IIB, a molecular motor that binds and contracts actin filaments, is essential for normal spine morphology and dynamics and represents a distinct biophysical pathway to control spine size and shape. Myosin IIB is enriched in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of neurons. Pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of myosin IIB alters protrusive motility of spines, destabilizes their classical mushroom-head morphology, and impairs excitatory synaptic transmission. Thus, the structure and function of spines is regulated by an actin-based motor in addition to the polymerization state of actin."
https://openalex.org/W2163740524,"Experience-dependent plasticity of visual cortical receptive fields (RFs) involves synaptic modifications in the underlying neural circuits, but the site and mechanism of these modifications remain to be elucidated. Using in vivo whole-cell recordings, we show that pairing visual stimulation at a given retinal location with spiking of a single neuron in developing rat visual cortex induces rapid RF modifications. The time course of the response to the visual stimulus at the paired RF location is altered, with an enhancement of the response preceding the spike time and a reduction following the spike. Such bidirectional modification is consistent with spike timing-dependent plasticity. Response modification also occurs at nearby locations, the direction and magnitude of which are correlated with the change at the paired location. In addition, changes at unpaired locations show a negative correlation with the initial strength of the response, which may facilitate rapid modification of the spatial RF profile."
https://openalex.org/W2146813156,"The kinetics of exo-endocytotic recycling could restrict information transfer at central synapses if neurotransmission were entirely reliant on classical full-collapse fusion. Nonclassical fusion retrieval by kiss-and-run would be kinetically advantageous but remains controversial. We used a hydrophilic quencher, bromophenol blue (BPB), to help detect nonclassical events. Upon stimulation, extracellular BPB entered synaptic vesicles and quenched FM1-43 fluorescence, indicating retention of FM dye beyond first fusion. BPB also quenched fluorescence of VAMP (synaptobrevin-2)-EGFP, thus indicating the timing of first fusion of vesicles in the total recycling pool. Comparison with FM dye destaining revealed that kiss-and-run strongly prevailed over full-collapse fusion at low frequency, giving way to a near-even balance at high frequency. Quickening of kiss-and-run vesicle reuse was also observed at higher frequency in the average single vesicle fluorescence response. Kiss-and-run and reuse could enable hippocampal nerve terminals to conserve scarce vesicular resources when responding to widely varying input patterns."
https://openalex.org/W1976220825,"The C-terminal domain of Hsp90 displays independent chaperone activity, mediates dimerization, and contains the MEEVD motif essential for interaction with tetratricopeptide repeat-containing immunophilin cochaperones assembled in mature steroid receptor complexes. An α-helical region, upstream of the MEEVD peptide, helps form the dimerization interface and includes a hydrophobic microdomain that contributes to the Hsp90 interaction with the immunophilin cochaperones and corresponds to the binding site for novobiocin, a coumarin-related Hsp90 inhibitor. Mutation of selected residues within the hydrophobic microdomain significantly impacted the chaperone function of a recombinant C-terminal Hsp90 fragment and novobiocin inhibited wild-type chaperone activity. Prior incubation of the Hsp90 fragment with novobiocin led to a direct blockade of immunophilin cochaperone binding. However, the drug had little influence on the pre-formed Hsp90-immunophilin complex, suggesting that bound cochaperones mask the novobiocin-binding site. We observed a differential effect of the drug on Hsp90-immunophilin interaction, suggesting that the immunophilins make distinct contacts within the C-terminal domain to specifically modulate Hsp90 function. Novobiocin also precluded the interaction of full-length Hsp90 with the p50cdc37 cochaperone, which targets the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain, and is prevalent in Hsp90 complexes with protein kinase substrates. Novobiocin therefore acts locally and allosterically to induce conformational changes within multiple regions of the Hsp90 protein. We provide evidence that coumermycin A1, a coumarin structurally related to novobiocin, interferes with dimerization of the Hsp90 C-terminal domain. Coumarin-based inhibitors then may antagonize Hsp90 function by inducing a conformation favoring separation of the C-terminal domains and release of substrate."

The cells were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Science, l-[35S]methionine specific activity, 1175.0 Ci/mmol, 7.9 mCi/ml. Total 35S activity, 2.3 mCi/181 μl) in DMEM lacking methionine/cysteine as described by Gorchakov et al. (13Gorchakov R. Frolova E. Frolov I. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 9397-9409Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). After 30-min labeling, the cells were lysed by mammalian protein extraction buffer as described above. The aliquots lysate was loaded onto Whatman No. 3MM paper and counted according to the method of Monnier et al. (12Monnier A. Belle R. Morales J. Cormier P. Boulben S. Mulner-Lorillon O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1453-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Polysome Analysis—Cells (6.7 ml, 1 × 105 cell/ml) and the complex formed by 3.4 μl of siRNA (20 μm) and 30 μl of HiPerFect in 200 μl of DMEM were transfected in a 10-cm plate. After 48 h of transfection, the medium was changed to normal growth medium. On day 3 control cells including control and HiPerFect-treated cells (∼60-70% confluence) were treated with cycloheximide (Sigma) at 100 μg/ml concentration for 3 min at 37 °C as described (14Johannes G. Sarnow P. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1500-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Then the cells were detached by 0.25% trypsin containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, neutralized by 4 °C growth medium, and washed twice at 4 °C with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. The growth medium and phosphate-buffered saline contained cycloheximide at 50 μg/ml. On day 4 the cells treated by siRNA were harvested as described above. Three to four plates of cells were pooled and lysed with 100 μl of buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 60 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mg/ml cycloheximide, 1 mg/ml heparin, and 400 units/ml RNase out) on ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Lysates (100-150 μl) were layered into 10-ml, 7-47% sucrose gradients for sedimentation at 39,000 rpm for 2 h and 30 min (8Yarunin A. Panse V.G. Petfalski E. Dez C. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 580-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The fraction analysis was performed as described by Dong et al. (7Dong J. Lai R. Nielsen K. Fekete C.A. Qiu H. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42157-42168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cell and Embryo Photographs—Embryos and cell cultures were photographed on an Olympus 1X70 microscope. Bioinformatics—For intron analysis the genomic sequence of each gene was identified from GenBank™ and aligned with the cDNA sequence. The position and phase of each intron was manually determined. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by first aligning the amino acid sequence with ClustalX (15Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35497) Google Scholar) and performing neighbor joining analysis in MEGA version 3.0 (16Kumar S. Tamura K. Nei M. Brief Bioinform. 2004; 5: 150-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (10647) Google Scholar). To understand whether the human ABCE1 protein plays a role in the translation of mammalian mRNAs, we incubated rabbit reticulocyte lysates with an antibody to human ABCE1. To confirm that the human ABCE1 antibody reacts with the rabbit ABCE1 protein, we performed an immunoprecipitation with rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The human ABCE1 antibody precipitates a single protein of the expected size (Fig. S1). Luciferase mRNA was added to the lysate as a template along with different quantities of ABCE1 antibody. Fig. 1A shows that, at 200 ng of antibody, luciferase activity was inhibited by 90% compared with the no-antibody control. Rabbit IgG was not effective in inhibiting translation of luciferase mRNA even at 10-fold higher concentrations than the ABCE1 antibody. A human eIF5 antibody also suppressed luciferase mRNA translation initiation. To demonstrate that the effect of ABCE1 on luciferase translation is specific for mRNA, we tested the effect of ABCE1 antibody on the translation of poly(U). Translation of poly(U) is accomplished independent of all initiation factors. The addition of ABCE1 antibody, at levels that severely inhibit translation of luciferase mRNA, had no significant effect on the translation of poly(U) (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the ABCE1 protein is an essential factor in vertebrate translation initiation. To determine whether the human ABCE1 protein is associated with the pre-initiation complex components eIF5 and eIF2, as in yeast (7Dong J. Lai R. Nielsen K. Fekete C.A. Qiu H. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42157-42168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we performed immunoprecipitation with ABCE1, eIF2α, and eIF5 antibodies in HeLa cell lysates. Precipitated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and detected with specific antisera. Fig. 1C shows that the eIF5 co-precipitated with ABCE1. In the reverse experiment, ABCE1 co-immunoprecipitated with eIF5 and to a lesser extent with eIF2α (Fig. 1C). Using an eIF2α antibody for detection we were also able to determine that eIF2α protein interacts with both eIF5 and ABCE1 (data not shown). Therefore, as in S. cerevisiae, ABCE1 associates with both eIF5 and eIF2. To further study the role of ABCE1 on mammalian cell growth, we employed siRNA to reduce the expression of the ABCE1 gene in a human tumor cell line (HEK 293). The sequences and position in the mRNA of six pairs of siRNA are shown in Table 1. We titrated the capability of these siRNAs to suppress ABCE1 gene expression and to avoid off-target effects, we used low concentrations of siRNA. Transfection with four of siRNAs (at 5-10 nm) for 49 h suppressed ABCE1 mRNA expression more than 70%. At 72 h after transfection we carried out protein analysis of ABCE1. Immunoblotting showed that siRNAs 203097 and 203098, at 10 nm, substantially reduced ABCE1 protein expression (Fig. S2).TABLE 1Sequence and location of ABCE1 siRNAssiRNASequencePositionExonbp203097UCAUCAAACCUCAAUAUGU617/635Exon 6ACAUAUUGAGGUUUGAUGA203098AUGUCAGCAGCUUGAUUUAA718/736Exons 7 and 8UUAAAUCAAGCUGCUGACA203099ACCCACCUAAAAGAACGAA736/754Exon 8UUCGUUCUUUUAGGUGGGU12213GGAAUGCAAAAAGAGUUGU186/204Exon 2ACAACUCUUUUUGCAUUCC12306GGUGAAGUUUUGGGAUUAG424/442Exon 5CUAAUCCCAAAACUUCACC12394GGCAACAUUAAUGCAAAAG2837/2855Exon 18CUUUUGCAUUAAUGUUGCC Open table in a new tab To evaluate the effect of suppression of ABCE1 expression on protein synthesis, the polysome profile was analyzed in cells treated with 10 nm siRNA 203097. In these cells, the large polysomes were significantly reduced, with a commensurate increase in free 80 S ribosomes (Fig. 2C). This shift from polysomes to monosomes is consistent with a severe impairment of translation initiation. The inhibition of the rate of translation initiation would be predicted to have profound effects on cell viability. Fig. 4A shows that after 7 days of transfection with siRNA 203097 the proliferation of the cells was dramatically decreased. From day 3 to 7, the cell number of siRNA transfected cells was only increased 18%. However, the cell number of control samples was increased 320 to 350% and nearly reached confluence in a 24-well plate. Morphologically the transfected cells were clearly less dense, and there were many rounded, dying cells (data not shown). Therefore, suppression of ABCE1 expression inhibits cell proliferation in a human tumor cell line. Total incorporation of 35S into methionine and cysteine was also measured and found to be reduced by over 90% (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 4Intron analysis of the ABCE1 gene. The introns were located in the genomic sequence of the ABCE1 ortholog from all available eukaryotic species. The introns are numbered consecutively across the top, and the number of introns in each species is shown following the species name. For each intron the amino acid residue involved in the splice is shown with phase 0 introns in yellow, phase 1 in green, and phase 2 in blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have established a conserved function for ABCE1 in the protein translation process and provided evidence that it is critical for the proliferation of human cells in culture. Thus, we would expect an essential role for this protein in vertebrate development. To test this concept, two antisense MOs were designed and injected into X. laevis embryos. These two MOs were injected at various concentrations into two-cell stage embryos and allowed to develop in culture. One MO spanned the ATG start codon sequence, thus inhibiting mRNA translation. The other MO traversed the splice acceptor site and effectively suppressed proper processing of ABCE1 mRNA (data not shown). Both MOs consistently arrested embryonic development at the gastrulation stage (Fig. 3). As expected, a control MO had no effect on development. These data demonstrate that ABCE1 is essential for vertebrate development as it is for yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans. While this work was in progress a recessive lethal mutation in the Danio rerio (zebrafish) genome was identified (17Amsterdam A. Nissen R.M. Sun Z. Swindell E.C. Farrington S. Hopkins N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12792-12797Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in CG1703 the Drosophila ortholog have also been described that are lethal (18Coelho C.M. Kolevski B. Walker C.D. Lavagi I. Shaw T. Ebert A. Leevers S.J. Marygold S.J. Genetics. 2005; 171: 597-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore ABCE1 is essential to all examined eukaryotes. The ABCE1 gene is highly conserved, not only in eukaryotes, but a copy of the gene is found in all archaea. To determine the extent of amino acid conservation of the ABCE1 gene, sequences were extracted from data bases for 21 eukaryotic genes and 24 archaeal genes. The sequences were aligned and used to produce an unrooted neighbor joining phylogenetic tree. All of the eukaryotic genes cluster as expected and provide a relationship of species consistent with other analyses. The only exceptions are the nematode species (C. elegans, Caenorhabditis briggsiae) whose ABCE1 sequence clusters with the single celled eukaryotes (Fig. S3). This indicates that the ABCE1 gene in these species has evolved more rapidly. Within archaea, all of the ABCE1 genes from the Crenarchaea and Euryarchaea cluster together, and the one sequence from a Nanoarchaea sequence appears to be the most divergent. Because of the very high level of conservation of the ABCE1 gene, and the fact that is present as a single copy, it is one of the few genes that can be used to unambiguously study the evolution of intervening sequences. As expected none of the archae ABCE1 genes have introns, whereas all of the eukaryotic sequences have at least one intron, except for S. cerevisiae (Fig. 4). Each intron in every eukaryotic gene characterized was coded as to position in the protein and phase of the intron. Phase 0 introns splice between codons, phase 1 between the 1st and 2nd base of the codon, and phase 2 between the 2nd and 3rd bases. As can be seen in Fig. S3, all of the vertebrate ABC genes contain a conserved set of 16 introns, with the fish species, Fugu and Tetraodon possessing an additional intron. Therefore the organization of the ABCE1 gene has remained virtually unchanged in vertebrate evolution. The first 5 introns in the Arabidopsis ABCE1 gene are identical to the vertebrate genes, but in the 3′-half of the gene this plant species has 5 introns not present in vertebrates. The insects and nematodes have only 2-6 introns in their ABCE1 genes, but nearly all are in identical positions and phases as the vertebrate introns. This is consistent with a model in which an ancestral eukaryote had a large number of introns and many of these have been lost in certain species. The ABCE1 gene is the most conserved member of the ABC gene family and is one of the most conserved genes in vertebrate and archaeal genomes (19Dean M. Annilo T. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2005; 6: 123-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). This fact alone suggests that the gene plays an essential role in biology that is common between archae and eukaryotes. In addition, null mutations in the gene are homozygous lethal in every organism that has been examined. In this paper we found that ABCE1 is essential in Xenopus and that suppression of translation or splicing with morpholino oligonucleotides results in the cessation of growth of the embryo during gastrulation, a period when the germ layers of the embryo are formed and the body plan of the mature organism is established. ABCE1 mRNA was detectable by reverse transcription-PCR in oocytes, and growth cessation presumably occurs at the point at which most of the maternal protein has degraded. The ABCE1 protein was originally identified due to an interaction with and inhibition of RNase L, a nuclease induced by interferon (3Bisbal C. Martinand C. Silhol M. Lebleu B. Salehzada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13308-13317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, RNase L is not found outside of vertebrates, indicating that ABCE1 has alternate functions. The identification of the role of the RLI/ABCE1 protein in ribosome biogenesis and in assembly of the pre-initiation complex of the ribosome in S. cerevisiae provides a function that is both essential and universal to eukaryotes (7Dong J. Lai R. Nielsen K. Fekete C.A. Qiu H. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42157-42168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore this is likely to be the original role of ABCE1 and the protein has adapted interaction with RNase L as a secondary function. However, we cannot rule out additional roles for ABCE1 in the cell. The mammalian ribosome is substantially different from the yeast ribosome. For example the initiation complex compnent eIF3 has 14 subunits in mammals and only 6 in yeast. Therefore the importance of ABCE1 in mammalian protein initiation required experimental evidence. The important role of ABCE1 in protein synthesis is extended by the data presented here showing that the protein is essential in in vitro and in vivo translation of mammalian proteins. Antisera to ABCE1 block in vitro translation of mRNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysates but not of poly(U) molecules that can be translated independent of initiation factors. As in yeast, ABCE1 interacts with the eukaryotic initiation factors eIF5 and eIF2 components of the pre-initiation complex. Inhibition of ABCE1 in human cells results in dramatic inhibition of growth, reduction in the amount of large polysomes, and incorporation of labeled amino acids into newly synthesized protein. This is consistent with the results in yeast and supports a critical role for ABCE1 in the initiation of translation. A single copy of the ABCE1 gene is found in all eukaryotes, except for Arabidopsis, which has two. This provides an excellent situation for the analysis of the phylogenetic relationships between species. From our analysis of a large number of eukaryotic and archae species ABCE1 reproduces the known relationships between species in both kingdoms. The only exception is the nematodes C. elegans and C. briggsiae in which the gene seems to be evolving more rapidly. The ABCE1 gene in C. elegans (Y39E4B.1) is essential and may have acquired other interacting partners that have driven its evolution (20Gonczy P. Echeverri C. Oegema K. Coulson A. Jones S.J. Copley R.R. Duperon J. Oegema J. Brehm M. Cassin E. Hannak E. Kirkham M. Pichler S. Flohrs K. Goessen A. Leidel S. Alleaume A.M. Martin C. Ozlu N. Bork P. Hyman A.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). The conservation of ABCE1 also allows for an analysis of the evolution of intervening sequences in eukaryotes. All vertebrate ABCE1 genes contain 16 introns, except for some fish that have an additional 17th intron. The introns in the 5′-half of the gene are largely conserved in the plant (Arabidopsis) ABCE1 gene, but the introns in the 3′-half of the gene are in different locations in Arabidopsis as compared with vertebrates. All of the insect and nematode ABCE1 genes contain vastly reduced numbers of introns (2Hassel B.A. Zhou A. Sotomayor C. Maran A. Silverman R.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3297-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 3Bisbal C. Martinand C. Silhol M. Lebleu B. Salehzada T. J. Biol.

Virol. 2004; 78: 1645-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the introns they do contain are rarely shared, except for closely related species. For example the honey bee, mosquito, and fruit fly share only one intron. However, all of the 11 introns found in the insect and nematode genes are in identical positions (and frames) as one of the vertebrate introns. This strongly supports the model derived from other genes that an ancestral eukaryote contained a large number of introns, many of which have been lost in certain lineages (21Roy S.W. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5773-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The inhibition of ABCE1 could have therapeutic applications. Because the protein is essential to most or all eukaryotes, specific inhibitors could be used in the treatment of pathogens. For example, inhibitors specific to plasmodia, fungi, and/or protozoan parasites could be used to inhibit such organisms as they infect human or other animals. We have shown here that ABCE1 inhibitors efficiently suppress the growth of human tumor cells. It is known that tumor cells have a high capacity for protein translation, and proteins involved in translation such as S6 kinase, mTOR, and 4E-BP1 are molecular targets for cancer therapy (22Guertin D.A. Sabatini D.M. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; 11: 353-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 23Mamane Y. Petroulakis E. Rong L. Yoshida K. Ler L.W. Sonenberg N. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3172-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). It is possible that cancer cells are more sensitive to inhibition of protein translation through ABCE1 than are normal cells. Last, ABCE1 is required for the assembly of HIV-1 and other lentiviruses (5Zimmerman C. Klein K.C. Kiser P.K. Singh A.R. Firestein B.L. Riba S.C. Lingappa J.R. Nature. 2002; 415: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Drugs that interfere with the HIV/ABCE1 interaction could be used as antiretroviral agents. The ABCE1 protein is unusual in containing a Fe-S cluster binding site. It has long been known that Fe-S clusters are assembled in the mitochondria, and this process is essential to the cell. ABCE1 clearly represents one essential Fe-S containing protein. Whether this is the only essential protein in this class remains to be determined. In summary we have demonstrated that the ABCE1 protein plays a role in the initiation of translation of proteins, similar to its role in yeast. We also show that this highly conserved gene is essential to Xenopus development and the growth of human cells, just as it is to yeast, C. elegans, Drosophila, and zebrafish. The ABCE1 gene is one of the few genes conserved between archae and eukaryotes and can therefore be used for phylogenetic analysis of species and the evolution of introns.

Using computational modeling, whole-cell recording, and dynamic clamp of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells in brain slices, we examined how INaP changes the transduction of excitatory current into action potentials. Model simulations predicted that INaP increases afterhyperpolarizations, and, although it increases excitability by reducing rheobase, INaP also reduces the gain in discharge frequency in response to depolarizing current (f/I gain). These predictions were experimentally confirmed by using dynamic clamp, thus circumventing the longstanding problem that INaP cannot be selectively blocked. Furthermore, we found that INaP increased firing regularity in response to sustained depolarization, although it decreased spike time precision in response to single evoked EPSPs. Finally, model simulations demonstrated that INaP increased the relative refractory period and decreased interspike-interval variability under conditions resembling an active network in vivo.

Neurons transduce synaptic input into action potentials through interplay between the large ionic membrane currents underlying the action potential and a set of smaller currents operating at membrane potentials just below the spike threshold. The latter “threshold currents” are pivotal for determining spike timing, spike pattern, and frequency. Determining the roles of these currents is therefore essential for understanding how neurons encode information into a pattern of action potentials. The persistent sodium current (INaP) is a threshold current prominently expressed in neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons (Stafstrom et al., 1985Stafstrom C.E. Schwindt P.C. Chubb M.C. Crill W.E. Properties of persistent sodium conductance and calcium conductance of layer V neurons from cat sensorimotor cortex in vitro.J.

Lett. 1985; 56: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and many other mammalian neurons (Crill, 1996Crill W.E. Persistent sodium current in mammalian central neurons.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Both INaP and the classical spike-generating transient Na+ current (INaT) activate rapidly. INaP differs from INaT both by lacking fast inactivation and by activating at more negative potentials, ∼10 mV below the spike threshold. In accordance with these features, INaP has been reported to modulate subthreshold dynamics. We recently showed that INaP contributes to subthreshold electrical resonance in the theta frequency range in hippocampal pyramidal neurons (Hu et al., 2002Hu H. Vervaeke K. Storm J.F. Two forms of electrical resonance at theta frequencies, generated by M-current, h-current and persistent Na+ current in rat hippocampal pyramidal cells.J. Physiol. 2002; 545: 783-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). INaP has also been shown to enhance excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in hippocampal (Lipowsky et al., 1996Lipowsky R. Gillessen T. Alzheimer C. Dendritic Na+ channels amplify EPSPs in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells.J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 76: 2181-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and neocortical pyramidal cells (Stafstrom et al., 1985Stafstrom C.E. Schwindt P.C. Chubb M.C. Crill W.E.

Voltage-activated sodium channels amplify inhibition in neocortical pyramidal neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Various aspects of how a neuron translates synaptic input into spike frequency—so-called current-to-frequency transduction—can be studied by injecting a depolarizing current (I) into the cell and plotting the spike frequency (f) as a function of the current intensity (f/I plot) (Lanthorn et al., 1984Lanthorn T. Storm J. Andersen P. Current-to-frequency transduction in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells: slow prepotentials dominate the primary range firing.Exp. Brain Res. 1984; 53: 431-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A major mechanism controlling the f/I relation is the afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) that follow action potentials (Vogalis et al., 2003Vogalis F. Storm J.F. Lancaster B. SK channels and the varieties of slow after-hyperpolarizations in neurons.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 3155-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Being due mainly to opening of K+ channels triggered by spike depolarization or by associated influx of Ca2+, AHP conductances control the firing frequency, regularity, and spike timing precision in a variety of neurons, including hippocampal pyramidal cells (Hotson and Prince, 1980Hotson J.R. Prince D.A. A calcium-activated hyperpolarization follows repetitive firing in hippocampal neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1980; 43: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, Madison and Nicoll, 1984Madison D.V. Nicoll R.A. Control of the repetitive discharge of rat CA 1 pyramidal neurones in vitro.J. Physiol. 1984; 354: 319-331PubMed Google Scholar, Storm, 1989Storm J.F. An after-hyperpolarization of medium duration in rat hippocampal pyramidal cells.J. Physiol. 1989; 409: 171-190PubMed Google Scholar). Through both direct hyperpolarization and an increase in the membrane conductance, AHPs contribute to the relative refractory period, thus mediating negative-feedback regulation of the discharge frequency. Activation of an inward current such as INaP is at least expected to increase neuronal excitability. Since INaP can act as an intrinsic amplification mechanism of subthreshold voltage perturbations (Crill, 1996Crill W.E. Persistent sodium current in mammalian central neurons.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that it might also affect the dynamics of AHPs and indirectly modify the input-output relations of the cell. Since AHPs have been suggested to improve temporal precision during spike trains (de Ruyter van Steveninck et al., 1997de Ruyter van Steveninck R. Lewen G.D. Strong S.P. Koberle R. Bialek W. Reproducibility and variability in neural spike trains.Science. 1997; 275: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, Berry and Meister, 1998Berry M.J. Meister M. Refractoriness and neural precision.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2200-2211PubMed Google Scholar) and promote stable rhythmic spiking by filtering out noise (Schreiber et al., 2004Schreiber S. Fellous J.M. Tiesinga P. Sejnowski T.J. Influence of ionic conductances on spike timing reliability of cortical neurons for suprathreshold rhythmic inputs.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 91: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we also wished to determine how INaP affects spike timing and regularity. Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells are a convenient prototype for testing these ideas, in particular since their AHPs have been characterized in multiple previous studies. In this cell type, spikes are followed by three types of AHPs due to different K+ channels: fast (fAHP), medium (mAHP), and slow (sAHP) (Storm, 1990Storm J.F.

To date, technical difficulties have precluded direct testing of the impact of INaP on neuronal firing behavior and the f/I relation. While the roles of other threshold currents have been studied with specific pharmacological or genetic manipulations (e.g., Nolan et al., 2003Nolan M.F. Malleret G. Lee K.H. Gibbs E. Dudman J.T. Santoro B. Yin D. Thompson R.F. Siegelbaum S.A. Kandel E.R. Morozov A.

Neurosci. 2005; 8: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), such approaches are hampered in the case of INaP because of its close relationship with INaT. In particular, blockers of INaP (e.g., TTX and phenytoin) also affect the INaT-dependent action potentials, possibly because INaP and INaT arise from different gating modes of the same channel type (Alzheimer et al., 1993Alzheimer C. Schwindt P.C. Crill W.E. Modal gating of Na+ channels as a mechanism of persistent Na+ current in pyramidal neurons from rat and cat sensorimotor cortex.J.

Physiol. 1996; 58: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). In this study, we circumvent these difficulties by combining computational modeling with dynamic-clamp electrophysiological measurements. First, we tested our ideas theoretically. Simulations revealed that INaP not only enhanced AHPs, it also had contrasting effects on excitability. On one hand, and as expected, INaP reduced the minimal current necessary to evoke spiking (rheobase). On the other hand, INaP also reduced the slope (gain) of the f/I relation. We then tested these predictions experimentally in whole-cell recordings from rat CA1 pyramidal neurons by using dynamic clamp to selectively eliminate INaP or to artificially restore INaP in the presence of TTX. These experiments not only confirmed the model predictions, they also showed additional and contrasting effects of INaP on the temporal aspects of spike firing. On one hand, INaP increased the regularity of repetitive firing in response to sustained depolarization, but on the other hand, INaP also decreased spike time precision in response to single EPSPs. Thus, INaP was shown to have contrasting effects on both different indexes of excitability (rheobase and f/I gain) and different indexes of spike timing accuracy (firing regularity during repetitive firing and spike time precision during transient synaptic excitation). In addition, model simulations demonstrated that INaP increased the relative refractory period and decreased interspike-interval variability under conditions resembling an active network in vivo. Model simulations were generally performed first to predict the outcome of future experiments; these predictions were subsequently tested by electrophysiological recordings in brain slices. Thus, the model predictions illustrated in both Figure 1, Figure 3 were made before testing them experimentally, as shown in Figure 2, Figure 4. Next, the model predictions illustrated in Figure 5A were performed, followed by the experimental tests shown in Figures 5B–5C. Once the main (qualitative) predictions had been made, tested, and confirmed, data from the experiments were sometimes used for adjusting the parameters of the model to achieve a better quantitative fit to the data.Figure 2Electrophysiological Analysis of INaP Behavior with TTX and Dynamic ClampShow full caption(A) Diagram of the experimental setup with dynamic clamp.

As a first approach to determining whether INaP can affect AHPs, we performed numerical simulations using a computer model of a rat CA1 pyramidal neuron derived from a previous model (Borg-Graham, 1999Borg-Graham L. Interpretations of data and mechanisms for hippocampal pyramidal cell models.in: Jones E.G. Ulinski P.S. Peter A. Cerebral Cortex, Volume 12: Cortical Models. Plenum Press, New York1999Google Scholar). Our model is described in detail in Experimental Procedures (Computational Methods) and in the Supplemental Data available with this article online. Briefly, it is a compartmental model consisting of a dendritic cable and a soma with 11 active membrane conductances and intracellular Ca2+ dynamics. This model reproduces quite accurately the spiking behavior, AHPs, and resonance properties of these neurons (Shao et al., 1999Shao L.R. Halvorsrud R. Borg-Graham L. Storm J.F.

Physiol. 2005; 566: 689-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). For this study, we took special care to accurately model the Na+ conductances. In the original model (Borg-Graham, 1999Borg-Graham L. Interpretations of data and mechanisms for hippocampal pyramidal cell models.in: Jones E.G. Ulinski P.S. Peter A. Cerebral Cortex, Volume 12: Cortical Models. Plenum Press, New York1999Google Scholar), a novel four-state Markov model of the entire Na+ current was used in order to better replicate the dynamic and steady-state behavior of this current. In particular, the steady-state component of this INa model is consistent with reported measurements of INaP (French et al., 1990French C.R. Sah P. Buckett K.J. Gage P.W. A voltage-dependent persistent sodium current in mammalian hippocampal neurons.J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1139-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), which in turn is much less than the window current of Hodgkin-Huxley-type models of INa (Traub et al., 1994Traub R.D.

Neurosci. 1999; 7: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the steady-state and dynamic components of the Markov INa model can be adjusted relatively independently. For clarity, therefore, we here use INaT and INaP as two separate entities modeled as a Markov model (based on the Borg-Graham, 1999Borg-Graham L. Interpretations of data and mechanisms for hippocampal pyramidal cell models.in: Jones E.G. Ulinski P.S. Peter A. Cerebral Cortex, Volume 12: Cortical Models. Plenum Press, New York1999Google Scholar INa model, but without a steady-state component) and a Hodgkin-Huxley model, respectively. Using the cell model, we studied INaP in both voltage- and current-clamp simulations (Figure 1). The steady-state activation curve (Figure 1A) and the maximum conductance of the INaP model were based on our previous voltage-clamp measurements in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Hu et al., 2002Hu H. Vervaeke K. Storm J.F. Two forms of electrical resonance at theta frequencies, generated by M-current, h-current and persistent Na+ current in rat hippocampal pyramidal cells.J. Physiol. 2002; 545: 783-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and agree well with other experimental reports (French et al., 1990French C.R. Sah P. Buckett K.J. Gage P.W. A voltage-dependent persistent sodium current in mammalian hippocampal neurons.J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1139-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). A simulated depolarizing voltage ramp (Figure 1B, lower panel) produced an INaP (Figures 1B and 1C) that agreed well with experimental results (see Figure 2A in French et al., 1990French C.R. Sah P. Buckett K.J. Gage P.W. A voltage-dependent persistent sodium current in mammalian hippocampal neurons.J. Gen.

Only indirect indications of the INaP activation and deactivation kinetics are available because INaT obstructs detailed voltage-clamp analysis. Nevertheless, at subthreshold potentials, which is the range of greatest interest to our study, INaP has been shown to activate and deactivate within the settling time of single-electrode voltage clamp, i.e., in <3–4 ms (Stafstrom et al., 1985Stafstrom C.E.

In the model, we tested various voltage-independent time constants ranging from 0.5 to 10 ms and found that these variations made no qualitative difference to our results (data not shown), except where explicitly stated (see Figure 8). Some authors have reported a slow inactivation of INaP, with a time constant of several seconds (French et al., 1990French C.R. Sah P. Buckett K.J. Gage P.W.

Physiol. 1999; 114: 491-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Therefore, we checked whether such inactivation would affect our results by including an additional inactivation particle based on the Hodgkin-Huxley description from Magistretti and Alonso, 1999Magistretti J. Alonso A. Biophysical properties and slow voltage-dependent inactivation of a sustained sodium current in entorhinal cortex layer-II principal neurons: a whole-cell and single-channel study.J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 491-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar. However, slow inactivation of INaP did not qualitatively affect our results (data not shown); therefore, we performed all subsequent simulations with the simplest Hodgkin-Huxley model with only a single activation particle and no inactivation. To test how INaP behaves in current clamp, we simulated the injection of a depolarizing-current ramp (Figure 1D). The negative-current step before the start of the ramp evoked a “sag” (arrow) due to the activation of the h current, Ih (Halliwell and Adams, 1982Halliwell J.V. Adams P.R. Voltage-clamp analysis of muscarinic excitation in hippocampal neurons.Brain Res. 1982; 250: 71-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). When INaP was omitted from the model (Figure 1D, middle), the depolarizing slope beyond ∼−65 mV decreased (Figure 1D, right), in agreement with experimental data (Hotson et al., 1979Hotson J.R. Prince D.A. Schwartzkroin P.A. Anomalous inward rectification in hippocampal neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1979; 42: 889-895PubMed Google Scholar), and the spiking was reduced. The bottom panels of Figure 1D show INaP during these simulations. We next tested these theoretical predictions by recording from CA1 pyramidal cells in hippocampal slices using two approaches: (1) blockade of INaP with tetrodotoxin (TTX) and (2) electrical cancellation and addition of INaP by dynamic clamp. The dynamic-clamp technique was used to cancel INaP without affecting INaT. To this end, we used the INaP kinetics of our pyramidal-cell model in the dynamic clamp (Figure 2A). Available evidence suggests that INaP in CA1 and neocortical pyramidal neurons is mostly of perisomatic origin (French et al., 1990French C.R. Sah P. Buckett K.J. Gage P.W. A voltage-dependent persistent sodium current in mammalian hippocampal neurons.J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1139-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, Stuart and Sakmann, 1995Stuart G.

Lambert J.D.C. Somatic amplification of distally generated subthreshold EPSPs in rat hippocampal pyramidal neurones.J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, space clamp limitations are unlikely to substantially affect our results (see also Supplemental Data). Like in the model simulations, we injected a negative-current step followed by a depolarizing-current ramp and observed a similar “Ih sag” (Figures 2B and 2C) (n = 5). The bottom panels in Figures 2B and 2C show the simulated INaP that was injected by the dynamic clamp. This protocol was repeated in four different conditions in the following sequence in Figure 2B: (1) under control conditions; (2) with the dynamic clamp canceling the native INaP, i.e., an outward current equal in size to the calculated inward INaP was injected into the cell; (3) with INaP blocked by adding 1 μM TTX (dynamic clamp off); and (4) with TTX still present and the dynamic clamp turned back on, now with the calculated INaP injected as an inward current, thereby “restoring” INaP. In Figure 2C, the voltage responses from Figure 2B are shown superimposed, illustrating that elimination of INaP by either dynamic clamp ((1) + (2)) or TTX ((1) + (3)) reduced the depolarizing slope beyond ∼−65 mV and reduced spiking. Furthermore, the two methods had virtually identical effects on the subthreshold voltage response ((2) + (3)). The dynamic clamp also fully restored the effect of INaP after its blockade by TTX, thus reproducing the subthreshold voltage response under control conditions ((1) + (4)). These data yielded two sets of measurements of INaP at each subthreshold potential: the TTX-sensitive INaP and the INaP that was canceled by the dynamic clamp (the method is illustrated in Figure S1). In addition, we measured INaP in voltage clamp by applying a voltage ramp from −88 to −38 mV and subtracting the current response before and after adding TTX (n = 8; Figure S2A). These three data sets were all plotted in Figure 2D, showing that the values for INaP obtained by TTX blockade during current clamp and voltage clamp and by dynamic clamp recording were all virtually identical, thus confirming the validity of our dynamic-clamp approach. A noninactivating voltage-gated inward current such as INaP has two types of effects: (1) a simple, general depolarizing effect and (2) a set of more dynamic effects derived from its voltage dependence and the negative slope resistance that it mediates. In this study, we focused on the latter effects. Therefore, whenever INaP was changed, in the model or in experiments, we always compensated the change in the background membrane potential by injecting steady depolarizing current, in order to study the voltage-dependent effects of INaP at comparable membrane potentials. Thus, when using the model to explore whether INaP can modulate AHPs (Figure 3), we held the membrane potential at various potentials ranging from −58 to −80 mV by steady-current injection and evoked action potentials followed by AHPs. AHPs are enhanced by depolarization due to increased driving force for K+ (Madison and Nicoll, 1984Madison D.V. Nicoll R.A.

In order to compensate for this effect and compare the impact of INaP on AHPs of similar amplitudes at different potentials, we evoked more spikes from hyperpolarized holding potentials than at depolar"

Science. 1985; 229: 69-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), plays a central role in the regulation of HIV-1 replication and in potential approaches to treating latently infected cells. During transcription of the viral DNA, RNA polymerase II stalls as a result of binding the negative transcription elongation factor, resulting in the production of prematurely terminated transcripts that may include the tat message (3Jeang K.T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Following translation, the Tat protein is transported from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, where it binds a stem-loop structure (transactivation response element (TAR)) formed by the first 59 nucleotides of the HIV-1 RNA (4Berkhout B. Silverman R.H. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1989; 59: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tat stimulates elongation of full-length transcripts by recruiting the positive transcription elongation factor b, a complex of a regulatory cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase 9, that phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, components of negative transcription elongation factor, and the transcription elongation factor Spt5 (5Yamaguchi Y.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cyclin T1 is thought to interact with the Cys-rich region of Tat (23Bieniasz P.D. Grdina T.A. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7056-7065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mutation of any one of six of the seven Cys residues results in inactivation (3Jeang K.T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The end of the Cys-rich region and the core are involved in mitochondrial apoptosis of bystander noninfected cells through their ability to bind tubulin and prevent its depolymerization (24Chen D. Wang M. Zhou S. Zhou Q. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6801-6810Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The basic region is important for TAR binding (25Weeks K.M. Ampe C. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. Crothers D.M. Science. 1990; 249: 1281-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and nuclear localization, and the segment between Tyr-47 and Arg-57 has been used to transport a large variety of materials, including proteins, DNA, drugs, imaging agents, liposomes, and nanoparticles across cell and nuclear membranes (26Gupta B. Levchenko T.S. Torchilin V.P. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2005; 57: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The Gln-rich region has been implicated in mitochondrial apoptosis of T-cells (27Campbell G.R. Pasquier E. Watkins J. Bourgarel-Rey V. Peyrot V. Esquieu D. Barbier P. de Mareuil J. Braguer D.

The second tat exon defines residues 73–101 and includes an RGD motif that may mediate Tat binding to cell surface integrins (28Avraham H.K. Jiang S. Lee T.H. Prakash O. Avraham S. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 6228-6233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite numerous attempts, the biological function of the second exon-encoded polypeptide has been difficult to determine (12Guo X. Kameoka M. Wei X. Roques B. Gotte M. Liang C. Wainberg M.A. Virology. 2003; 307: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 22Smith S.M. Pentlicky S. Klase Z. Singh M. Neuveut C. Lu C.Y.

The Tat amino acid sequence has a low overall hydrophobicity and a high net positive charge, and analyses by several algorithms (29Linding R. Russell R.B. Neduva V. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3701-3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 30Uversky V.N. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L. Proteins. 2000; 41: 415-427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that it is a natively unfolded protein (31Fink A.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 32Uversky V.N. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 739-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) with a possible folding nucleus between residues 42 and 75; CD spectropolarimetry confirms the lack of secondary structure (17Vendel A.C. Lumb K.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Proteome analysis suggests that about 33% of eukaryotic proteins are natively unfolded or contain long stretches of unfolded polypeptide, whereas unfolded proteins are much less abundant among the archaea and eubacteria (5%) (33Ward J.J. Sodhi J.S. McGuffin L.J. Buxton B.F. Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). One advantage that unfolded proteins have over folded proteins is that they provide a much larger surface area, enabling multiple interactions with other molecules (34Gunasekaran K. Tsai C.J. Kumar S. Zanuy D. Nussinov R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 81-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The most common types of natively unfolded protein in yeast are transcription factors and transcription regulators as well as kinases (35Nakayama K.I. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and DNA is the most common target bound by unfolded proteins. A common mechanism of action for natively unfolded proteins involves partial or complete folding upon interaction with a binding partner (31Fink A.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 32Uversky V.N. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 739-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Areas of residual structure in unfolded proteins can be critical to forming the initial site of interaction with a binding partner (32Uversky V.N. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 739-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar), and delineation of those sites is required for the design of drugs and antibodies that interfere with binding. There have been several attempts to determine solution conformations of Tat and its segments both alone and in complexes. 1H NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations suggested that Tat-(1–86) (Z-variant) forms condensed domains encompassing the core and Gln-rich regions, whereas the basic and Cys-rich regions were found to be highly flexible at pH 6.3 under reducing conditions (36Bayer P. Kraft M. Ejchart A. Westendorp M. Frank R. Rosch P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In a model of the 87-residue Tat Mal protein at pH 4.5 under oxidizing conditions, the N-terminal Trp-11 forms a hydrophobic core through interactions with Phe-38 and Tyr-47 (37Gregoire C. Peloponese Jr., J.M. Esquieu D. Opi S. Campbell G. Solomiac M. Lebrun E. Lebreton J. Loret E.P. Biopolymers. 2001; 62: 324-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The basic region is in an extended conformation, and the Cys-rich region contains β-turns; α-helix is found in the Gln-rich segment. A low resolution, globular conformation with some flexible segments (particularly the basic region) was deduced for 13Cα-Gly-labeled synthetic Tat-(1–86) (Bru) at pH 4.5, in the absence of reducing agents (38Peloponese Jr., J.M. Gregoire C. Opi S. Esquieu D. Sturgis J. Lebrun E. Meurs E. Collette Y. Olive D. Aubertin A.M. Witvrow M. Pannecouque C. De Clercq E. Bailly C. Lebreton J. Loret E.P. C. R. Acad. Sci. III. 2000; 323: 883-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). An oxidized Tendamistat-Tat-(1–37) fusion protein showed multiple conformations with some evidence of helicity in the Cys-rich region (20Kuppuswamy M. Subramanian T. Srinivasan A. Chinnadurai G.

Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 672-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A fusion protein consisting of the activation domain from the unrelated equine infectious anemia virus and Tat-(48–57) showed high helical content in the basic domain by NMR spectroscopy and CD (40Puglisi J.D. Tan R. Calnan B.J. Frankel A.D. Williamson J.R. Science. 1992; 257: 76-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There have also been several studies of Tat fragments in complex with TAR RNA mainly focusing on the conformation of TAR (41Long K.S. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10059-10069Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 42Aboul-ela F. Karn J. Varani G. J. Mol.

NMR spectroscopy suggested a conformational change in Tat-(32–72) in the region of Gly-42 and Gly-44 upon binding to Tar (44Metzger A.U. Bayer P. Willbold D. Hoffmann S. Frank R.W. Goody R.S. Rosch P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). 1H NMR was also used to show that Tat-(46–55), acetylated at Lys-50, is bound in an extended conformation to the bromodomain of p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor, a histone acetyltransferase transcriptional coactivator (10Mujtaba S. He Y. Zeng L. Farooq A. Carlson J.E. Ott M. Verdin E. Zhou M.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 575-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). CD spectra suggested the possibility of a conformational change in Tat-(1–86) upon binding to the KIX domain of CREB-binding protein (17Vendel A.C. Lumb K.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 15N NMR relaxation measurements showed that Tat-(47–58) becomes slightly more ordered on binding heparin (46Hakansson S. Caffrey M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8999-9006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and CD studies of overlapping peptide fragments suggested that the most flexible regions are those that are adjacent to the basic region (47Gregoire C.J. Loret E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22641-22646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Determining the mechanisms by which proteins attain their biologically active three-dimensional structures is a fundamental goal of biology, with implications ranging from molecular recognition to understanding amyloid diseases (48Bertoncini C.W. Jung Y.S. Fernandez C.O. Hoyer W. Griesinger C. Jovin T.M. Zweckstetter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1430-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Multinuclear NMR spectroscopy is yielding insights into the folding process by characterizing unfolded proteins and equilibrium intermediates. The detection of residual native and nonnative structures in strongly denatured proteins suggests that they are important in seeding the early steps of protein folding (49Tafer H. Hiller S. Hilty C. Fernandez C. Wuthrich K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 860-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Frank M.K. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M.

Molten globule states of proteins have also been investigated by NMR and provide insight into the nature of the folding pathway and the structure of the transition state (57Onuchic J.N. Wolynes P.G. Luthey-Schulten Z. Socci N.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3626-3630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 58Redfield C. Methods. 2004; 34: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, although NMR spectroscopy is not ideally suited to kinetic studies of protein folding, it is incomparable in its ability to provide detailed information about the structures and dynamics of unfolded and partially folded proteins (59Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 394: 299-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). 1H NMR spectra of Tat are very difficult to assign due to poor dispersion of the resonances (36Bayer P. Kraft M. Ejchart A. Westendorp M. Frank R. Rosch P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 37Gregoire C. Peloponese Jr., J.M. Esquieu D. Opi S. Campbell G. Solomiac M. Lebrun E. Lebreton J. Loret E.P. Biopolymers. 2001; 62: 324-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 38Peloponese Jr., J.M. Gregoire C. Opi S. Esquieu D. Sturgis J. Lebrun E. Meurs E. Collette Y. Olive D. Aubertin A.M. Witvrow M. Pannecouque C. De Clercq E. Bailly C. Lebreton J. Loret E.P. C. R. Acad. Sci.

Biol. 1995; 250: 672-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In addition, fully and partially oxidized material is likely to be structurally heterogeneous, including the formation of disulfide cross-linked oligomers often observed on polyacrylamide gels and adding to the difficulty in structural characterization. To increase the dispersion of the NMR signals and permit dynamics analysis by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, we have prepared uniformly 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled Tat-(1–72) protein. The protein is unambiguously reduced at pH 4.1, and NMR analysis provides insight into the intracellular folding and dynamics of this intrinsically disordered protein and the folding propensities of its five sequence domains. Preparation of Histidine-tagged Tat—The detailed Tat-(1–72) expression and purification protocol will be published elsewhere. Briefly, an Escherichia coli codon-optimized synthetic exon 1 tat gene contained in pSV2tat72 was obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, from Dr. Alan Frankel (60Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 55: 1189-1193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar) and cloned into pET28b(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI), enabling protein expression with an N-terminal His6 segment and T7 epitope that adds 20 residues to the 72-residue protein. Protein expression was from E. coli BL21(DE3)plysS cells (Novagen, Madison, WI) in M9 minimal medium supplemented with either 15NH4Cl, or 15NH4Cl and U-13 C6-d-glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc., Andover, MA). The expression protocol was modified from recently published methods (61Marley J. Lu M. Bracken C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) that reduce the consumption of isotopically labeled ingredients. The protein was purified by elution from a Talon™ (Cobalt-Superflow) metal affinity resin (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) in a gravity flow column in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, 6 m guanidine HCl, and 10 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (Sigma) adjusted to pH 4.0 with sodium hydroxide. The eluted protein was pooled and serially dialyzed against degassed 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01 m ammonium acetate at pH 3 for ∼6 h each. A final dialysis was done against degassed water for 4 h. The dialysate was then frozen and freeze-dried. NMR Sample Preparation—Freeze-dried protein was dissolved in degassed buffer containing 50 mm acetate-d4, 20 mm MES buffer, 80 μm sodium sulfite, 0.02% sodium azide, and 5% D2O, pH 4.0. The resulting protein solution had a measured pH of 4.1, uncorrected for isotope effects. The sample was placed in an NMR tube that had been purged with argon for 15 min, and the dissolved protein was added to the sample tube under an argon atmosphere. The NMR tube cap was sealed with Teflon tape (Dupont Dow Elastomers LLC, Wilmington, DE). The final protein concentration was about 1 mm. The purity of the protein was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. The pH titration was done by dissolving separate protein samples in degassed buffers as described above, with subsequent verification of the pH. NMR Backbone Assignments—All backbone assignment experiments for the 92-residue 13C/15N-labeled histidine-tagged Tat-(1–72) were done on a 600-MHz Varian INOVA spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance probe head at 20.2 °C, using standard Varian BioPack pulse sequences (62Kay L.E.

The NMR probe was calibrated with methanol (68Cavanagh J.F. Wayne J. Palmer A.G. II I Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice.

NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (10723) Google Scholar). Spectra were apodized using a squared cosine bell function, zero-filled to twice the data set size, and linear predicted (forward-backward with eight prediction coefficients) prior to Fourier transformation. The dimensions of the resulting processed data sets were 4096 × 1024 for the 1H/15N HSQC experiment and 2048 × 256 × 128 for all three-dimensional experiments. The pulse sequences used are sensitivity-enhanced (with the exception of the HNHA experiment) and use gradients for coherence selection and water suppression (70Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U.

Radiation damping was suppressed with a water flip-back pulse (1.42 ms). 15N decoupling during acquisition was done using the WALTZ-16 sequence (71Shaka A.J. Keeler J. Frenkiel T. Freeman R. J. Magn.

However, the mechanism of sterol intestinal uptake is not clearly elucidated. Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), major component in the control of cholesterol homeostasis, is expressed in the intestine, but its role in this organ remains unclear. We have generated transgenic mice overexpressing SR-BI primarily in the intestine by using the mouse SR-BI gene under the control of intestinal specific “apoC-III enhancer coupled with apoA-IV promoter.” We found SR-BI overexpression with respect to the natural protein along the intestine and at the top of the villosities. After a meal containing [14C]cholesterol and [3H]triolein, SR-BI transgenic mice presented a rise in intestinal absorption of both lipids that was not due to a defect in chylomicron clearance nor to a change in the bile flow or the bile acid content. Nevertheless, SR-BI transgenic mice showed a decrease of total cholesterol but an increase of triglyceride content in plasma without any change in the high density lipoprotein apoA-I level. Thus, we described for the first time a functional role in vivo for SR-BI in cholesterol but also in triglyceride intestinal absorption.

Dyslipidemia (e.g. hyperlipidemia or dyslipoproteinemia) plays a key role in the development of obesity, cardiovascular disease, or the metabolic syndrome. Intestinal lipid absorption is an important contributor to the overall balance of lipid metabolism, but regulation at the molecular level remains largely unknown. Intestinal lipid absorption involves the luminal lipolysis of triglycerides to monoglycerides and fatty acids and of cholesterol esters to free cholesterol and fatty acids. Free cholesterol from diet or bile and the products of lipid hydrolysis interact with bile salts to form mixed micelles, which pass through an unstirred water layer covering the enterocyte surface (1Dawson P.A. Rudel L.L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The lipid molecules are then released from micelles and enter the enterocyte where they are assembled into chylomicrons before secretion into the circulation via the lymphatic network. They are finally transported to the liver through the chylomicron-remnant pathway (2Ros E. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 151: 357-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which enterocyte lipid absorption occurs are still controversial. In addition to a simple passive diffusion, there is strong evidence for the existence of a protein-facilitated mechanism (3Compassi S. Werder M. Boffelli D. Weber F.E. Hauser H. Schulthess G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16473-16482Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 4Thurnhofer H. Hauser H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2142-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 5Schulthess G.

Because of a significant positive correlation between cholesterol absorption and plasma cholesterol levels (7McGill Jr., H.C. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1979; 32: 2664-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), cholesterol absorption has been the subject of intense research. Different proteins have successively been implicated in intestinal lipid absorption. For instance, CD 36, a multiligand scavenger receptor, has been proposed to take up monoglycerides and fatty acids (8Drover V.A. Ajmal M. Nassir F. Davidson N.O. Nauli A.M. Sahoo D. Tso P. Abumrad N.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 1290-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) but could also participate in cholesterol absorption (9Werder M. Han C.H. Wehrli E. Bimmler D. Schulthess G. Hauser H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11643-11650Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 10van Bennekum A. Werder M. Thuahnai S.T. Han C.H. Duong P. Williams D.L. Wettstein P. Schulthess G. Phillips M.C. Hauser H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4517-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Recently, a newly discovered protein, NPC1L1 (the Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1), has been shown to play a major role in cholesterol absorption (11Altmann S.W. Davis Jr., H.R. Zhu L.J. Yao X. Hoos L.M. Tetzloff G. Iyer S.P. Maguire M. Golovko A. Zeng M. Wang L. Murgolo N. Graziano M.P. Science. 2004; 303: 1201-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar) because knock-out mice for this protein decreased intestinal cholesterol absorption by 80%. Also aminopeptidase-N has been implicated in cholesterol absorption (12Kramer W. Girbig F. Corsiero D. Burger K. Fahrenholz F. Jung C. Muller G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1633: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) 4The abbreviations used are: SR-BI, scavenger receptor-class B type 1; apo, apolipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; TG, triglyceride; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Tg, transgenic.4The abbreviations used are: SR-BI, scavenger receptor-class B type 1; apo, apolipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; TG, triglyceride; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Tg, transgenic. is also a likely element of intestinal cholesterol absorption. SR-BI is an 82-kDa membrane protein mostly expressed in liver and steroidogenic tissues. It binds native high density lipoproteins (HDL) (13Acton S.L. Rigotti A. Landschulz K. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar), LDL, or oxidized LDL and anionic phospholipids and mediates both the selective uptake of HDL cholesteryl ester by the liver and free cholesterol efflux from cells of peripheral tissues (14Stangl H. Hyatt M. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32692-32698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). SR-BI is also expressed in enterocyte brush-border membranes mainly at the top of intestinal villosities and in the proximal part of intestine where cholesterol absorption mainly occurs (15Cai S.F. Kirby R.J. Howles P.N. Hui D.Y. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 902-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the importance of SR-BI in intestinal cholesterol absorption is under debate because the disruption of the SR-BI gene in mice does not affect cholesterol absorption (16Mardones P. Quinones V. Amigo L. Moreno M. Miquel J.F. Schwarz M. Miettinen H.E. Trigatti B. Krieger M. VanPatten S. Cohen D.E. Rigotti A. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 170-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the process seems to be more complex and might depend on the combined actions of transporter proteins involved in uptake and efflux of cholesterol, which could compensate for the lack of SR-BI in the intestine. In order to get new data on the role of SR-BI in cholesterol absorption, we have generated transgenic mice overexpressing SR-BI primarily in the intestine. The transgene contains the mouse SR-BI gene under the control of the human intestinal specific apolipoprotein (apo) C-III enhancer coupled with the apoA-IV promoter. This construct is the only promoter known to induce a decreasing expression along the gastro-colic axis and an increasing one from the crypt to the top of the villosity (17Le Beyec J. Chauffeton V. Kan H.Y. Janvier P.L. Cywiner-Golenzer C. Chatelet F.P. Kalopissis A.D. Zannis V. Chambaz J. Pincon-Raymond M. Cardot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4954-4961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here we show that SR-BI intestinal overexpression increases intestinal absorption of both cholesterol and triglyceride. Generation of Transgenic Mice—The murine SR-BI cDNA was obtained by digestion of pRC/CMV vector by restriction enzymes HindIII and XbaI. The apolipoprotein C-III enhancer (-500/-890 pb)-apolipoprotein A-IV promoter (-700 pb) was excised from pUCSHCAT plasmids (18Ogami K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9808-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the restriction enzymes XbaI and HindIII. The construct containing the human apolipoprotein C-III enhancer-apolipoprotein A-IV promoter to the intestinal specificity and the 1.8-kb cDNA fragment of SR-BI (19Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. Moya M.L. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) was cloned into XbaI site of the pcDNA 1.1 vector. A linearized fragment of the construct was obtained by digestion of the vector by the restriction enzymes SalI and AvrII and used to generate transgenic mice by standard procedures in a B6D2 background. The mouse genotyping was performed on DNA extracted from tail biopsies by PCR amplification using primers specific for the construct alleles as follows: primer 1, 5′-GCTAGGGCTTTGAATAACTAG-3′, and primer 2, 5′-GACCAAGATGTTAGGCAGTACAAT-3′. Founder animals were backcrossed to C57/Bl6 for 12 generations to have a homogeneous background. The mice were housed at the Institute Animal Core Facility in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle and were fed a basal chow diet. Studies were performed using 8–15-week-old SR-BI transgene versus control littermates negative for the SR-BI transgene and fasted overnight before the initiation of absorption studies. All experiments were performed with the approval of the Ethical Committee for Animal Experiments of the University of Toulouse (MP/04/11/03/05). Plasma Lipid Analysis—Blood samples were collected from mice, and plasma HDL were isolated by LDL/VLDL precipitation with phosphotungstate/MgCl2 reagent (HDL-cholesterol; Sigma). Total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and total triglycerides were determined using commercial enzymatic assays (Randox) adapted for micro methods. LDL/VLDL cholesterol was determined from the difference between total and HDL cholesterol. Plasma Lipoprotein Analysis—Lipoproteins were separated from equal pool of plasma (400 μl) of transgenic SR-BI and wild type mice by sequential density ultracentrifugation, intermediate density lipoprotein/VLDL (d = 1.006–1.019), LDL (d = 1.019–1.055), and HDL (d = 1.055–1.21). Samples were collected in equal volume, and proteins of each fraction were separated by electrophoresis on 4–16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue. Membrane Preparation and Protein Analysis—Animals were sacrificed, and different tissues were collected and immediately frozen. Intestine was removed and flushed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then cut into three equal sections (proximal-medium-distal) on ice. Each section was opened, and the mucosa was scraped, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Tissues were homogenized at 4 °C in 1.5 ml of PBS containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mm phenanthroline (from Sigma) by using a Turax blender and then 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C, 250 × g, for 5 min to eliminate tissue debris, and then membrane proteins were pelleted at 4 °C, 200,000 × g for 15 min. Total membrane proteins were resuspended in PBS with the protease inhibitor mixture. Proteins were determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). In some experiments, intestinal epithelial cells were isolated and separated in a villus to crypt gradient according to Weiser (20Weiser M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2536-2541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and directly used for Western blot analysis. Proteins from the different tissue extracts were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblot analysis of SR-BI was performed by chemiluminescence detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using rabbit antipeptide polyclonal antibodies against mouse SR-BI protein (dilution 1:1000, Abcam, antibody 3) and horseradish peroxidase coupled-anti rabbit polyclonal secondary antibody (Sigma). Immunohistochemistry—In some experiments, small pieces of intestinal sections were collected separately and included in paraffin. Paraffin sections were mounted on silanized slides, and paraffin was removed with different toluene baths. Sections were regenerated by microwave in citrate buffer, pH 6, and biotin and endogenous peroxidase activity were inhibited by the use of Dako kit. Sections were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with anti-SR-BI primary antibody (1:500, Abcam, anti-SR-BI/BII, antibody 115) diluted in Tris-buffered saline, 0.3% bovine serum albumin. After washing, sections were incubated with pig anti-goat biotinylated secondary antibody (1:100) for 30 min and diluted in Tris-buffered saline with pig serum (1:25). Sections were washed and incubated with streptavidin-peroxidase complex (Dako) for 30 min. The peroxidase activity was revealed using 3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as chromogen (Dako). Samples were observed under a light microscope. Lipid Tissue Distribution—Liver and intestinal mucosa divided in three parts were homogenized in 1 ml of methanol/water (2:1, v/v), EGTA 5 mm (Sigma). Lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (21Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar), and molecular species of neutral lipids (cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, diacylglycerols, and triacylglycerols) were quantitated by gas liquid chromatography (22Vieu C. Jaspard B. Barbaras R. Manent J. Chap H. Perret B. Collet X. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1153-1161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intestinal Absorption of Lipids—To determine dietary lipid absorption, mice were fasted overnight and then fed by gavage with a mixture of 2 μCi of [4-14C]cholesterol/1 μCi of [9,10-3H]triolein (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 2 g/liter cholesterol (Sigma) suspended in 100 μl of corn oil. Blood was collected hourly from the tail, and plasma was isolated for liquid scintillation counting. Six hours after gavage, mice were sacrificed. Intestines were removed, flushed with PBS, and cut in three equal parts, and the mucosa was scraped and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The gallbladder was removed, and the bile was collected for liquid scintillation counting. Livers were harvested and immediately frozen. The different samples were homogenized in methanol/water (2:1, v/v), and tissue distribution of radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. In a series of experiments, to gain access to the total intestinal lipid uptake, plasma lipoprotein lipase was inhibited by retro-orbital injection of 100 μl of Triton WR1339/saline (1:6, v/v) prior to gavage (23Kirby R.J. Howles P.N. Hui D.Y. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 89-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Bile Analysis—To determine the excretion rate of cholesterol into bile, animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of Hypnorm (fentanyl/fluanisone, 1 ml/kg) and diazepam (10 mg/kg). 100 μl of medium chain triglycerides (intralipid; Sigma) containing 2 μCi of [14C]cholesterol were injected in the caudal vein; the common bile duct was ligated close to the duodenum; and then the gallbladder was punctured and its content was removed. After 30 min, newly secreted bile was collected for 90 min by gallbladder cannulation, and the associated 14C radiolabel was determined by scintillation counting. During bile collection, body temperature was stabilized using a humidified incubator. In other experiments, bile flow and the bile acid rates were analyzed from the bile collected for 60 min via gallbladder cannulation (24Kruit J.K. Plosch T. Havinga R. Boverhof R. Groot P.H. Groen A.K. Kuipers F. Gastroenterology. 2005; 128: 147-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Bile flow was determined gravimetrically assuming a density of 1 g/ml for bile. Bile acids were determined by HPLC. Briefly, 2 μl of bile were diluted with 15 μl of internal standard (norcholic acid 6.7 mm; Steraloids, Wilton, NH) in methanol to precipitate proteins. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was further diluted in methanol (1:600). Samples (100 μl) were separated by HPLC (DIONEX Sumit) on a LiChrosorb RP-18 analytical column (5 μm particle size, 25 cm × 4.6 mm inner diameter) fitted with a C18 guard column cartridge (1 cm × 4.6 mm; Supelco) and coupled to a light scattering detector (Polymer Laboratory ELS 2100, nitrogen flow 1.2 ml/min, evaporating temperature 90 °C, and nebulizer temperature 70 °C). Separation was achieved at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min using a ternary solvent system (25Torchia E.C. Labonte E.D. Agellon L.B. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as follows: ammonium acetate, pH 5.2 (30 mm), methanol, acetonitrile, 35:60:5 v/v/v for 25 min move to 24:53:23 in 5 min, then plateau for 20 min. Characterization of the Transgenic Mice Overexpressing SR-BI in the Intestine—We have generated transgenic mice overexpressing SR-BI under the control of the apolipoprotein C-III enhancer coupled to the apolipoprotein A-IV promoter, and we analyzed the presence of SR-BI in tissue extracts (Fig. 1). In control animals, SR-BI protein was classically expressed mostly in the liver among other tissues, whereas transgenic mice displayed a dramatic overexpression of a mature (82 kDa) SR-BI almost totally restricted to the intestine (Fig. 1, A and B). Some overexpression was observed in liver extracts from transgenic mice because of the activation of the promoter also in this organ (17Le Beyec J. Chauffeton V. Kan H.Y. Janvier P.L. Cywiner-Golenzer C. Chatelet F.P. Kalopissis A.D. Zannis V. Chambaz J. Pincon-Raymond M. Cardot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4954-4961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). RNA analysis in the two tissues confirmed a 25-fold increase of SR-BI in the intestine and a 3-fold increase in the liver from transgenic mice when compared with control (not shown). The promoter induced an overexpression of SR-BI in accordance to the distribution of endogenous membrane-bound protein, i.e. decreasing from the duodenum (proximal part of the small intestine) to the colon (Fig. 1C) and increasing from the crypt to the top of the villosities (Fig. 1D) where intestinal absorption is mainly present. We confirmed the overexpression of SR-BI by immunocytochemistry on different intestinal sections (Fig. 2). We also observed the presence of the protein at the top of the villosities and on the luminal side of enterocytes in control mice (Fig. 2, B, E, and H), and overexpression was observed at the same sites in transgenic mice (Fig. 2, C, F, and I).FIGURE 2Intestinal localization of SR-BI. Sections of small intestine from wild type and transgenic mice were incubated with anti-SR-BI antibodies followed by incubation with biotinylated secondary antibodies and with the streptavidin-peroxidase complex.

Most interestingly, we observed a dramatic decrease (2.5-fold) in plasma total cholesterol content that was present both in HDL and LDL/VLDL fractions. By contrast, total triglycerides were mildly but significantly increased, reflecting a differential regulation between cholesterol and triglyceride in the transgenic mice. Analysis of the proteins present in lipoproteins fractions separated by density gradients from the plasma did not show any significant difference in the amount of the apolipoproteins (apoB100, apoB48, apoE, and apoA-I) present in VLDL, LDL, or HDL fractions between control and transgenic mice (Fig. 4). Thus the size of the lipoprotein particles might be different because the ratio of cholesterol to protein is decreased by more than 2 in the transgenic animals. Analysis of lipid content in tissues extracts from intestine or liver (Table 1) did not reveal any difference between control and transgenic mice for free or esterified cholesterol, triglyceride, or diglyceride, indicating that the decrease in cholesterol content observed in plasma was not linked to an accumulation in the major organs. By contrast, free cholesterol was increased by 20% in bile suggesting an increased catabolism of cholesterol in the transgenic mice. However, this was not accompanied by a change in the volume of bile in gallbladder (Table 2). In addition no significant difference in the body mass, the weight of the liver and adipose tissues (inguinal and epididymal representing the peripheral and profound white adipose tissue, respectively), was observed between wild type and SR-BI Tg animals (Table 2). The liver did not show steatosis.FIGURE 4Analysis of plasma apolipoprotein content. An aliquot of lipoproteins isolated by sequential density ultracentrifugation from equal amounts (400 μl) of pooled plasma from five mice were loaded onto reducing 4–16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue.

Most interestingly, we observed a significant increase for both 14C (Fig. 5A) and 3H (Fig. 5B) labels in the plasma up to 4 h following gavage (corresponding to a postprandial status). This indicated a net and similar accelerated absorption of cholesterol and at least the fatty acyl part of triglyceride in response to the overexpression of SR-BI in the intestine. Moreover, when the experiment was performed after the inhibition of lipoprotein lipase (infusion with Triton WR1339), the levels of radiolabels in plasma were much higher, but the same difference between wild type and SR-BI Tg mice was observed for both 14C (Fig. 5C) and 3H (Fig. 5D) labels, indicating that increased absorption rates were not because of a defective chylomicron remnant clearance. Radioactive cholesterol also significantly accumulated in the intestinal tissue and in the liver (Fig. 6A), indicating a redistribution of the absorbed cholesterol in the organism. Also, radioactivity related to the triglyceride fraction was increased in different organs (Fig. 6B), which was in agreement with the observed increase in plasma total triglycerides (Fig. 3). Bile content in the 14C label was also increased 2-fold in the transgenic animals (not shown), suggesting a stimulation of the cholesterol secretion that could be attributed to the overexpression of SR-BI in liver. To confirm this hypothesis, labeled cholesterol was directly injected in the caudal vein, and the distribution of cholesterol label was analyzed in bile and plasma (Fig. 7). A net increase of the bile to plasma cholesterol ratio was observed in transgenic mice, indicating that the radioactive cholesterol injected in blood was rapidly excreted into bile, supporting the increased secretion of cholesterol from liver of SR-BI transgenic animals. However, to evaluate a possible role of the bile acid pool in the increased lipid absorption observed in SR-BI Tg mice, we performed gallbladder cannulation followed by bile collection up to 1 h to access the bile acid pool and bile flow delivered to the intestine. No significant difference was observed in the bile flow rate (4.2 ± 0.7 and 2.5 ± 1.1 μl/min/100 g of body weight) nor in the two major bile acids, taurocholic acid (198 ± 41 versus 134 ± 64 nmol/min/100 g of body weight) and tauromuricholic acid (166 ± 39 and 138 ± 49 nmol/min/100 g of body weight) in wild type (n = 5) and SR-BI Tg (n = 4), respectively. We generated transgenic mice overexpressing SR-BI mainly in the small intestine using a specific part of the apoC-III/apoA-IV promoter sequence. This promoter also induced a mild overexpression in the liver as described previously (17Le Beyec J. Chauffeton V. Kan H.Y. Janvier P.L. Cywiner-Golenzer C. Chatelet F.P. Kalopissis A.D. Zannis V.

Until now, this transgenic mouse strain was the only model of intestinal overexpression of SR-BI respecting the natural expression of the protein, i.e. at the apical site of enterocytes, increasing from crypt to villus and with a cephalo-caudal decrease. Thus, SR-BI is expressed where intestinal cholesterol absorption mainly occurs in SR-BI transgenic mice as in wild type littermates. This study shows for the first time that SR-BI plays a role in vivo in intestinal cholesterol absorption. Indeed, the intestinal cholesterol uptake determined by radioactive acute phase measurement of plasma cholesterol was doubled 3 h after gavage in the transgenic mice. However, this is in contradiction with recent results obtained on knock-out SR-BI mice, which indicated only a minor effect of SR-BI in intestinal cholesterol uptake (16Mardones P. Quinones V. Amigo L. Moreno M. Miquel J.F. Schwarz M. Miettinen H.E. Trigatti B. Krieger M. VanPatten S. Cohen D.E. Rigotti A. J.

Here, we demonstrate a multifunctional role for calnexin as both a molecular chaperone uniquely required for rhodopsin maturation and a regulator of Ca2+ that enters photoreceptor cells during light stimulation. Mutations in Drosophila calnexin lead to severe defects in rhodopsin (Rh1) expression, whereas other photoreceptor cell proteins are expressed normally. Mutations in calnexin also impair the ability of photoreceptor cells to control cytosolic Ca2+ levels following activation of the light-sensitive TRP channels. Finally, mutations in calnexin lead to retinal degeneration that is enhanced by light, suggesting that calnexin's function as a Ca2+ buffer is important for photoreceptor cell survival.

Our results illustrate a critical role for calnexin in Rh1 maturation and Ca2+ regulation and provide genetic evidence that defects in calnexin lead to retinal degeneration. G protein-coupled receptors are synthesized on membrane-bound ribosomes and undergo translocation, modification, folding, oligomeric assembly, and quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003bEllgaard L. Helenius A. Quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). To deal with these complex and error-prone processes, the ER has evolved a system centered around the calnexin family of molecular chaperones, which promotes the proper folding and assembly of newly synthesized glycoproteins. Calnexin is a type I transmembrane protein that, like its soluble ER homolog calreticulin, interacts with the monoglucosylated glycan (Glc1Man7-9GlcNAc2) present on folding intermediates of glycoproteins. Nascent glycoproteins associate with calnexin or calreticulin via a cycle of binding and release. (Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003aEllgaard L. Helenius A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). This cycle is key for ER quality control, as it inhibits aggregation, prevents premature exit from the ER, and exposes glycoproteins to accessory enzymes and folding factors (Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003aEllgaard L.

Despite considerable understanding of the calnexin/calreticulin cycle, little is known about the requirement for calnexin in protein processing in vivo. Rhodopsin is the prototypical member of the vast G protein-coupled receptor family. As in vertebrates, Drosophila rhodopsin (Rh1) initiates the phototransduction cascade by interacting with a heterotrimeric G protein, which then activates a distinct effector enzyme, namely phospholipase C (PLC-β). Activation of PLC leads to the opening of the cation-selective TRP and TRPL channels, resulting in a dramatic rise in intracellular Ca2+ (reviewed in Hardie and Raghu, 2001Hardie R.C. Raghu P. Visual transduction in Drosophila.Nature. 2001; 413: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, Pak and Leung, 2003Pak W. Leung H. Genetic approaches to visual transduction in Drosophila melanogaster.Receptors Channels. 2003; 9: 149-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To become functionally active, newly synthesized rhodospin must be precisely folded and successfully navigate the secretory pathway to the phototransducing compartment of the photoreceptor cells, the rhabdomeres (Colley et al., 1991Colley N.J.

Rhabdomeres consist of numerous tightly packed microvilli containing the phototransduction machinery. The mechanisms that regulate the folding and transport of rhodopsin are essential for photoreceptor cell function and survival, as defects in rhodopsin maturation lead to retinal degeneration in both Drosophila and vertebrates (Colley et al., 1991Colley N.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24752-24759Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Protein maturation defects characterized in blinding diseases have broad implications, as protein misfolding and aggregation are characteristic of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease (Muchowski and Wacker, 2005Muchowski P.J. Wacker J.L. Modulation of Neurodegeneration by molecular chaperones.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Here, we investigate whether calnexin functions as a chaperone for Rh1 and whether mutations in calnexin lead to neurodegeneration. In addition to its role as a molecular chaperone, calnexin is thought to bind Ca2+ at two distinct sites. The first resides in the long N-terminal domain localized to the lumen of the ER. The crystal structure of vertebrate calnexin shows that this luminal domain consists of two distinct regions: a compact, globular domain and a proline-rich arm called the P domain (Figure 1A). The globular domain is thought to bind a single Ca2+ ion and is also involved in glucose binding (lectin domain) (Schrag et al., 2001Schrag J.D. Bergeron J.J.M. Li Y. Borisova S. Hahn M. Thomas D.Y. Cygler M. The structure of calnexin, an ER chaperone involved in quality control of protein folding.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 633-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Although less well defined, several lines of evidence suggest that calnexin may harbor a second Ca2+-binding domain within the highly charged C-terminal cytosolic tail (C domain). Interestingly, this cytosolic domain displays structural similarity to calreticulin's luminal C domain, but is positioned on the opposite, cytosolic side of the ER membrane (Tjoelker et al., 1994Tjoelker L.W. Seyfried C.E. Eddy R.L. Byers M.G. Shows T.B. Calderon J. Schreiber R.B. Gray P.W. Human, mouse, and rat calnexin cDNA cloning: identification of potential calcium binding motifs and gene localization to human chromosome 5.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3229-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Calreticulin's C domain displays low-affinity and high-capacity Ca2+ binding and is thought to buffer luminal Ca2+ (Baksh and Michalak, 1991Baksh S. Michalak M. Expression of calreticulin in Escherichia coli and identification of its Ca2+ binding domains.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21458-21465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the in vivo role of calnexin's C domain is unknown, these Ca2+-binding properties would make it ideal for buffering high concentrations of cytosolic Ca2+. Precise spatial and temporal control over Ca2+ levels is essential for phototransduction in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Furthermore, prolonged elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ can be toxic, leading to cell death (Dolph et al., 1993Dolph P.J. Ranganathan R. Colley N.J. Hardy R.W. Socolich M. Zuker C.S.

Light activation, adaptation, and cell survival functions of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger CalX.Neuron. 2005; 45: 367-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, the light-sensitive TRP and TRPL channels mediate a massive Ca2+ influx into the rhabdomeres that is essential for amplification, rapid-response kinetics, and light adaptation (Hardie and Raghu, 2001Hardie R.C. Raghu P. Visual transduction in Drosophila.Nature. 2001; 413: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Ca2+ can rise to about 1 mM in the rhabdomeres (Postma et al., 1999Postma M.

The mechanisms controlling Ca2+ in the cell body are poorly understood but presumably include sequestration by the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) (Hardie, 1996aHardie R.C. Excitation of Drosophila photoreceptors by BAPTA and ionomycin: evidence for capacitative Ca2+ entry?.Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and buffering by cytosolic Ca2+-binding proteins. Here, we explore the hypothesis that calnexin serves as a buffer for cytosolic Ca2+ following the acute Ca2+ rise during phototransduction and that it may thereby help to prevent Ca2+ toxicity and promote photoreceptor cell survival. In this report, we demonstrate a multifunctional role for calnexin as both a critical molecular chaperone for Rh1 biosynthesis and a regulator of cytosolic Ca2+. Mutations in calnexin cause retinal degeneration that is enhanced by light, suggesting that calnexin's role in Ca2+ removal may be important for photoreceptor cell survival. These results provide genetic evidence that failure in Rh1 maturation and Ca2+ overload, resulting from defects in calnexin, are responsible for retinal degeneration. By screening the Zuker collection of EMS-mutagenized Drosophila lines, we identified two independent mutants that displayed a severe reduction in Rh1 compared to wild-type (wt) (Figure 2A, lanes 1–3). We established that the two mutants were allelic, as the transheterozygotes displayed reduced levels of Rh1 (Figure 2A, lane 4). Furthermore, we established that both alleles were recessive (Figure 2A, lanes 8 and 9). To identify the mutant locus responsible for the phenotype, we first used deficiency mapping to narrow the cytogenetic location to 99A7 on the third chromosome, corresponding to four genes (Figures 1C and 2A, lanes 5 and 6). We sequenced this small region and identified mutations in the coding region of calnexin in both alleles (Brody et al., 2002Brody T. Stivers C. Nagle J. Odenwald W.F. Identification of novel Drosophila neural precursor genes using a differential embryonic head cDNA screen.Mech. Dev. 2002; 113: 41-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, Christodoulou et al., 1997Christodoulou S. Lockyer A.E. Foster J.M. Hoheisel J.D. Roberts D.B. Nucleotide sequence of a Drosophila melanogaster cDNA encoding a calnexin homologue.Gene. 1997; 191: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We found that one allele harbored a C to T transition at nucleotide position 544, causing a premature stop codon at glutamine182, and that the other allele harbored a G to A transition at nucleotide position 356, causing a premature stop codon at tryptophan119. Based on cytology, we designated the two alleles cnx99A1 (cnx1) and cnx99A2 (cnx2), respectively. Drosophila calnexin99A (Cnx) displays 49% amino acid identity with human calnexin (chromosome 5q), shown in Figure 1B. To provide further evidence that mutations in cnx were responsible for the severe reduction in Rh1, we introduced the wt cnx gene into the cnx mutants by using a duplication for 99A that was translocated to the X chromosome [Dp(3;1) B152] and confirmed that it restored the normal function (Figures 1C and 2A, lane 7). Consistent with the presence of the stop codons, the cnx mutants displayed severely reduced levels of cnx transcript (Figure 2B, lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6). In addition, the Cnx protein was absent in both of the cnx mutants (Figure 2C, lanes 2 and 3), while it was detected in wt flies (Figure 2C, lane 1). Lane 4 confirms that the mutants were allelic. Cnx protein was not detected in the cnx1 and cnx2 mutants when they were crossed to a deficiency (Df) that eliminated 99A (Df(3R)Ptp99A[R3]) (Figure 2C, lanes 5 and 6). These data supported the hypothesis that the mutations were in the cnx gene. Calnexin is thought to play a role in the folding of a large number of proteins. Consistent with this notion, cnx was ubiquitously expressed at all stages during development and in the adult (Figure 2B). cnx transcript was detected in wt embryos (Figure 2B, lane 9), larvae (Figure 2B, lane 8), and adult heads and bodies (Figure 2B, lanes 3 and 7, respectively). cnx transcript and Cnx protein were also detected in heads from flies lacking eyes (eya1) (Figure 2B, lane 4, and Figure 2C, lane 8), indicating that cnx expression was not restricted to the eyes. Despite the widespread expression pattern of cnx, it was not required for viability or fertility of the flies, as the mutants were homozygous viable. Although Rh1 required Cnx for its expression, Cnx expression was normal in Rh1 mutants (Figure 2C, lane 7). Although Rh1 protein levels were severely reduced in the cnx mutants (Figure 2A, lanes 2 and 3), Rh1 transcript levels were normal in both (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available online). These data suggest that Cnx functions post-transcriptionally and are consistent with a role for Cnx as a chaperone in Rh1 biosynthesis. To investigate the role of Cnx in Rh1 biosynthesis, we assessed the kinetics of Rh1 maturation in the cnx1 mutant (Figure 3A). We utilized transgenic flies carrying the Rh1 gene under the control of a heat-shock promoter (hs) and tagged with an epitope corresponding to 12 amino acids at the C terminus of bovine rhodopsin (hs-Rh1-bov transgene) (Colley et al., 1995Colley N.J. Cassill J.A. Baker E.K. Zuker C.S. Defective intracellular transport is the molecular basis of rhodopsin-dependent dominant retinal degeneration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 3070-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The transgene was introduced into wt, cnx1, and ninaAP269 mutant flies. To initiate Rh1 biosynthesis, the transgenic flies were given a 1 hr heat-pulse at 37°C, shifted back to 22°C, and assayed at specific time points. We followed the fate of the heat-induced Rh1 protein by using a monoclonal antibody (1D4) directed to the epitope tag (bov). No Rh1 expression was detected in the flies prior to heat-pulse (Figure 3A, lane 1, no pulse). In wt flies, Rh1 was initially detected as immature high-MW forms that were converted to the mature low-MW form by 18 hr. In the cnx1 mutant, Rh1 was also initially detected as immature high-MW forms but was significantly reduced by 24 hr. By 48 hr, very little Rh1 was detected, suggesting that most of the Rh1 was degraded. The failure of Rh1 to mature in the cnx1 mutant was similar to the fate of Rh1 in the ninaA mutant (Figure 3A). We have previously shown that NinaA is a chaperone specifically required for Rh1 biosynthesis and maturation (Baker et al., 1994Baker E.K. Colley N.J. Zuker C.S. The cyclophilin homolog NinaA functions as a chaperone, forming a stable complex in vivo with its protein target rhodopsin.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4886-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, Colley et al., 1991Colley N.J. Baker E.K. Stamnes M.A. Zuker C.S. The cyclophilin homolog ninaA is required in the secretory pathway.Cell. 1991; 67: 255-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). As in the cnx1 mutant, Rh1 was initially detected as immature high-MW forms in the ninaA mutant. In contrast to the cnx1 mutant, where most of the Rh1 was degraded, Rh1 accumulated in the immature high-MW form in the ninaA mutant. We also followed the subcellular localization of Rh1 in the pulse-chase experiments (Figure 3B). In wt flies, by 8 hr following the heat-pulse, Rh1 immunolocalized to the ER in a perinuclear fashion, was detected in a punctate pattern consistent with transport vesicles, and was detected in the rhabdomeres. By 12 hr, more Rh1 was detected in the rhabdomeres, and by 24 hr, mature Rh1 localized solely to the rhabdomeres. This represents the normal progression for Rh1 maturation and transport through the secretory pathway. In the cnx1 mutant, by 8 hr, Rh1 was detected predominantly in the ER. By 12 hr, Rh1 was still most noticeable in the ER. By 24 hr, Rh1 labeling was detected in both the ER and rhabdomeres, but was significantly fainter than wt. These results show that in the cnx mutant, while most Rh1 was degraded, some Rh1 successfully evaded the quality-control mechanisms and was transported to the rhabdomeres. In the ninaA mutants, at 8, 12, and 24 hr, Rh1 was detected primarily in the ER. A very small amount of Rh1 was detected in the rhabdomeres of ninaA mutants, again indicating that a small amount of Rh1 evaded the ER's quality-control system. It is possible that Cnx and NinaA are part of a protein-processing pathway, ensuring proper folding and quality control of Rh1 during biosynthesis. To gain insights into the epistatic relationship between the two chaperones, we created mutant flies that were defective in both cnx and ninaA. The ninaAP269;cnx1 double mutant displayed severely reduced levels of Rh1, comparable to those seen in the cnx1 mutant alone (Figure 3C, lanes 4 and 2, respectively). These data demonstrate that in the double mutant, Rh1 was effectively degraded (as in cnx, Figure 3C, lane 2) rather than accumulating in the ER (as in ninaA, Figure 3C, lane 3). Therefore, cnx is epistatic to ninaA, as the phenotype of the cnx mutation overrides the phenotype of the ninaA mutation in the double mutant. Because the two chaperones are required for Rh1 biosynthesis, we investigated the levels of NinaA protein in the cnx mutants. Figure 3D shows that the NinaA levels in cnx were indistinguishable from wt levels, suggesting that the defects in Rh1 were the result of a lack of Cnx, rather than a lack of NinaA. The association of Cnx with Rh1 was assessed by coimmunoaffinity experiments (Baker et al., 1994Baker E.K. Colley N.J. Zuker C.S. The cyclophilin homolog NinaA functions as a chaperone, forming a stable complex in vivo with its protein target rhodopsin.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4886-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Cnx was isolated in a stable complex with Rh1 (Figure 3E, lane 2), but did not bind to or elute from the immunoaffinity column in the absence of Rh1 (extracts from the Rh1 null allele, ninaEI17) (Figure 3E, lane 3). These data indicated that Cnx and Rh1 physically associate in a protein complex, consistent with a role for Cnx as a molecular chaperone for Rh1. Examination of the cnx mutants revealed that they displayed an age-related retinal degeneration (Figure 4). Photoreceptor cells in 1-day-old cnx mutants displayed diminished rhabdomere size (Figure 4B) as compared to wt (Figure 4A). They also displayed accumulations of rough ER membranes, dilated Golgi, and various types of deposits (Figures 4B and 4C). These secretory pathway defects were consistent with a failure in Rh1 maturation. The identity of the deposits is unknown, but they may consist of degraded material within the cells. At 1 month, cnx mutants displayed a dramatic loss of rhabdomeres in the R1-6 photoreceptor cells, while the R7 and R8 photoreceptor cell rhabdomeres remained (Figures 4D and 4E, respectively). The Drosophila compound eye is made up of approximately 750 individual eye units called ommatidia. Each ommatidium contains eight photoreceptor cells (Figure 3B). Only R1-6 photoreceptors express Rh1, whereas R7 and R8 cells express a variety of different opsins (Rh3-6) (Chou et al., 1996Chou W.H. Hall K.J. Wilson D.B. Wideman C.L. Townson S.M. Chadwell L.V.

A new rhodopsin in R8 photoreceptors of Drosophila: evidence for coordinate expression with Rh3 in R7 cells.Development. 1997; 124: 1665-1673PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that only R1-6 rhabdomeres degenerated, and not R7 and R8, suggested that the opsins located in R7 and R8 were expressed normally. To confirm normal expression of the minor rhodopsins in R7 and R8 cells, we performed immunocytochemical analysis of Rh3, Rh4, and Rh5 opsins in the cnx mutants. We found all three opsins to be correctly localized to the rhabdomeres of the R7 and R8 cells (Figure 5), confirming that while Cnx was required by Rh1, it was not required by the R7 and R8 opsins. We examined whether ER processing of other photoreceptor proteins was defective in the cnx mutant. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that another membrane protein, chaoptin, was present at its normal location in the rhabdomeres of the R1-8 photoreceptor cells in both cnx mutants (Figure 5D) and wt (Figure 5H). In addition, we performed immunoblotting analysis to confirm that a number of key phototransduction proteins, including the G protein α subunit (Gqα), the TRP and TRPL channels, PLC-β (norpA), arrestin 1 (Arr1), and arrestin 2 (Arr2) were all expressed at levels indistinguishable from wt (Figure 5I). These results demonstrated that while Cnx was required for processing of Rh1, it was not required for expression of these other photoreceptor cell proteins. To determine the expression pattern for Cnx, we generated polyclonal antibodies that recognized a 97 kDa band in wt flies that was not present in the mutants (Figure 2C). Cnx localized to the ER of all eight photoreceptor cells, often to ER cisternae that were tightly associated with the nuclear envelope (Figure 6). The labeling pattern for Cnx was compared to the ER proteins, InsP3R (inositol-1,3,5-trisphosphate receptor) and NinaA (Figure 6). All three proteins were expressed in the ER, but were absent from the rhabdomeres. Although the rhabdomeres of the central R7 photoreceptor cells were labeled by the InsP3R antibody, we previously showed this labeling to be nonspecific (Raghu et al., 2000Raghu P. Colley N.J. Webel R. James T. Hasan G. Danin M. Selinger Z. Hardie R.C. Normal Phototransduction in Drosophila Photoreceptors Lacking an InsP3 Receptor Gene.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 429-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). While Cnx protein was uniquely required by Rh1 in the R1-6 cells, it was detected in the ER of all eight photoreceptor cells (Figure 6). To assess whether the retinal degeneration observed in the cnx mutants was enhanced by light activation of the phototransduction cascade, we reared the cnx mutants for 1 month in constant darkness. These flies displayed a less severe retinal degeneration (Figure 4F) compared with cnx mutants grown for 1 month on a 12:12 light-dark cycle (Figures 4D and 4E). Therefore, activation of phototransduction by light enhanced the retinal degeneration in the cnx mutants. This result is contrasted to other known mutants defective in Rh1 maturation, such as ninaA, in which the retinal degeneration was light independent (Figures 4G and 4H) (Colley et al., 1991Colley N.J.

The finding that light enhanced the retinal degeneration in the cnx mutant led us to investigate whether Ca2+ influx through the light-sensitive channels contributed to the retinal degeneration. Null mutations in the gene encoding the eye-enriched PLC (norpA) eliminate the light-induced Ca2+ influx. We generated norpA;cnx double mutants and found that norpA slowed down the onset and progression of the retinal degeneration in the cnx mutants (Figures 4I and 4J). The finding that the retinal degeneration in the cnx mutants was light enhanced and slowed by norpA, in combination with previous findings that calnexin binds Ca2+ (Tjoelker et al., 1994Tjoelker L.W. Seyfried C.E. Eddy R.L. Byers M.G. Shows T.B. Calderon J. Schreiber R.B. Gray P.W.

Current models of phototransduction suggest that virtually all aspects of excitation and adaptation are mediated within the microvilli. Because Cnx is located in the ER, we predicted that mutations in cnx would not affect the basic light responses, but might cause defects in Ca2+ buffering in the cell body.

It features a 15-megabase stretch that has a much greater mutation rate in hominids than the corresponding region in other mammals. Included in this region are genes influencing brain size and the immune system. The International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium (IHGSC) recently completed a sequence of the human genome1. As part of this project, we have focused on chromosome 8. Although some chromosomes exhibit extreme characteristics in terms of length, gene content, repeat content and fraction segmentally duplicated, chromosome 8 is distinctly typical in character, being very close to the genome median in each of these aspects. This work describes a finished sequence and gene catalogue for the chromosome, which represents just over 5% of the euchromatic human genome. A unique feature of the chromosome is a vast region of ∼15 megabases on distal 8p that appears to have a strikingly high mutation rate, which has accelerated in the hominids relative to other sequenced mammals. This fast-evolving region contains a number of genes related to innate immunity and the nervous system, including loci that appear to be under positive selection2—these include the major defensin (DEF) gene cluster3,4 and MCPH15,6, a gene that may have contributed to the evolution of expanded brain size in the great apes. The data from chromosome 8 should allow a better understanding of both normal and disease biology and genome evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1964151355,"Native amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels exhibit a variety of biophysical properties, including variable sensitivities to amiloride, different ion selectivities, and diverse unitary conductances. The molecular basis of these differences has not been elucidated. We tested the hypothesis that co-expression of δ-epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) underlies, at least in part, the multiplicity of amiloride-sensitive Na+ conductances in epithelial cells. For example, the δ-subunit may form multimeric channels with αβγ-ENaC. Reverse transcription-PCR revealed that δ-ENaC is co-expressed with αβγ-subunits in cultured human lung (H441 and A549), pancreatic (CFPAC), and colonic epithelial cells (Caco-2). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that δ-ENaC is co-expressed with α-, β-, and γ-ENaC in H441 cells at the protein level. Measurement of current-voltage that cation selectivity ratios for the revealed relationships Na+/Li+/K+/Cs+/Ca2+/Mg2+, the apparent dissociation constant (Ki) for amiloride, and unitary conductances for δαβγ-ENaC differed from those of both αβγ- and δβγ-ENaC (n = 6). The contribution of the δ subunit to PLi/PNa ratio and unitary Na+ conductance under bi-ionic conditions depended on the injected cRNA concentration. In addition, the EC50 for proton activation, mean open and closed times, and the self-inhibition time of δαβγ-ENaC differed from those of αβγ- and δβγ-ENaC. Co-immunoprecipitation of δ-ENaC with α- and γ-subunits in H441 and transfected COS-7 cells suggests an interaction among these proteins. We, therefore, concluded that the interactions of δ-ENaC with other subunits could account for heterogeneity of native epithelial channels.

We, therefore, concluded that the interactions of δ-ENaC with other subunits could account for heterogeneity of native epithelial channels. The diverse biophysical properties of native epithelial Na+ channels have been reviewed previously (1Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Na+ conductance, PNa/PK, and amiloride affinity differ between various tissues and species. For example, a 10-pS amiloride-sensitive Li+ conductance was recorded in H441 cells, and two amiloride-sensitive conductances (4 and 20 pS) were found in A549 cells (2Itani O.A. Auerbach S.D.

Generally, native epithelial Na+ channels can be classified into three subtypes according to their permeability to cations (1Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 5Matalon S. O'Brodovich H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 627-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The highly Na+ selective channel (type I) resembles αβγ-ENaC 3The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; hENac, human ENaC; MES, 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; RT, reverse transcription; HA, influenza A virus hemagglutinin; MOT, mean open time; MCT, mean closed time; CFPAC, human pancreatic duct cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; pS, picosiemens. heterologously expressed in oocytes. However, the molecular basis of the moderate selective (type II) and nonselective Na+ channels (type III) in epithelia, such as the 20-pS channels in A549 (6Lazrak A. Samanta A. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L848-L857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 10-pS channel in H441 cells (2Itani O.A. Auerbach S.D. Husted R.F. Volk K.A. Ageloff S. Knepper M.A. Stokes J.B. Thomas C.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L631-L641PubMed Google Scholar), is unknown. The α-ENaC subunit was originally cloned from the rat colon and has subsequently been identified in a variety of mammalian and amphibian species (1Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 7Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Five ENaC subunits have been cloned to date, namely α-, β-, γ-, δ-, and ϵ-ENaC. Among them, the β- and γ-subunits regulate the channel activity of the “conducting” α-, δ-, and ϵ-ENaC subunits when heterologously expressed in oocytes and cell lines (7Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Biophysical characterization of αβγ-ENaC channels has revealed a Na+ conductance of 4 pS and a Li+ conductance of 7 pS, respectively. αβγ-ENaC is highly permeable to Na+ but virtually impermeable to K+, with a PNa/PK greater than 20. Amiloride sensitivity and other properties of αβγ-ENaC are reflective of the characterization of highly Na+ selective channels in native epithelial cells. In comparison with the α-subunit, δ-ENaC exhibits differences in Na+ conductance, amiloride affinity, self-inhibition, and PNa/PLi selectivity ratio (8Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B.

However, neither αβγ- nor δβγ-ENaC can match all native amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels in their biophysical properties. Additionally, many of the cloned, conductive ENaC subunits are not activated by cAMP-elevating agents, which is a hallmark of native epithelial Na+ channels. The biophysical properties of ENaC depend on channel composition. α-like conducting subunits can form a channel sharing identical properties to channels composed of α-like and βγ subunits (9Waldmann R.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In contrast, αβ- and αγ-ENaC channels display variant amiloride sensitivity, conductance, and Na+ permeability (14McNicholas C.M. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 15Fyfe G.K. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). On the other hand, properties of native amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels are dependent on culture conditions (16Yue G. Hu P. Oh Y. Jilling T. Shoemaker R.L. Benos D.J. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C630-C640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Jain L. Chen X.J. Ramosevac S. Brown L.A. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L646-L658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells grown on permeable supports have a channel that more closely resembles heterologously expressed αβγ-ENaC channels than the channels expressed by cells grown on coverslips (18Hamilton K.L. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: C200-C207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it has been reported that a functional ENaC complex is composed of either 2α/1β/1γ, or alternatively, 3α3β/3γ (7Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 19Staruschenko A. Medina J.L. Patel P. Shapiro M.S. Booth R.E. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27729-27734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), channel properties may not be determined in a stoichiometric manner. The existence of other subunits may play an important role in determining native channel properties. Indeed, numerous studies demonstrated that culture conditions, cellular protein polarization, subunit composition, and splice variants can partly account for the diversity in channel properties (1Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 16Yue G. Hu P. Oh Y. Jilling T. Shoemaker R.L. Benos D.J. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Matalon S. Am. J.

However, the putative influence of the δ-subunit co-expression on the ENaC channel properties has not been documented. In the present study, we have tested the hypothesis that δ-ENaC is co-expressed with αβγ-ENaC subunits in epithelia and that δ-ENaC influences the biophysical features of αβγ channels when coexpressed in oocytes. Our results indicated that monovalent and divalent cation selectivities, single channel Na+ conductance, amiloride affinity, gating kinetics, and proton activation of δαβγ-hENaC were intrinsically distinguishable from those of αβγ- and δβγ-ENaC. We also demonstrated the presence of δ-ENaC mRNA in human lung, pancreatic, and colonic epithelial cells using RT-PCR. Also, for the first time, we showed that native α- and γ-ENaC co-immunoprecipitate with δ-ENaC in H441 cells and in transiently transfected COS-7 cells, supporting the idea that these four mammalian ENaC subunits combine to form multimeric channels with novel biophysical properties. Oocyte Expression and Whole-cell Recordings—cRNAs for human δ-, α-, β-, and γ-ENaC (hENaC) were prepared as described previously (20Ji H.L. Parker S. Langloh A.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C64-C74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Defolliculated oocytes were cytosolically injected with hENaC cRNAs (25 ng) per oocyte in 50 nl of RNase free water with a ratio of 1δ:1α:1β:1γ subunit (except for cRNA concentration-dependent experiments) and incubated in half-strength L-15 medium. Whole-cell cation currents were measured by the two-electrode voltage clamp technique 2 days after injection. Oocytes were impaled with two electrodes, each having resistances of 0.5-2 megaohms when filled with 3 m KCl. A TEV 200 voltage clamp amplifier was used to clamp the oocytes with concomitant recording of currents. Two reference electrodes were connected to the bath. Sampling protocols were generated by pCLAMP 8.0, and the current at -60 mV was simultaneously monitored with a chart recorder. The control superfusate was ND-96 (in mm:96NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 2 KCl, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.5). Superfusate with pH 6 or below was buffered with MES. pH was adjusted with NaOH and HCl. In experiments designed to measure the ion selectivity, Na+ salt was replaced with equal molar amounts of Li+, K+, Cs+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ for determination of ion selectivity. Switching of bath solutions with neutral or acidic pH was controlled by an SF-77B Perfusion Fast-Step system (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT). Current-voltage relationships were acquired by stepping the holding potential in 20-mV increments from -120 to +80 mV after the monitoring currents were stable, with and without the application of amiloride (100 μm). Data were sampled at a rate of 1 kHz and filtered at 500 kHz. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Confluent H441, A549, CFPAC, and Caco-2 cells were scraped into ice-cold PBS. Following pelleting in a microcentrifuge, the PBS was discarded, and the cells were snap-frozen in a dry ice-methanol mixture and stored at -80 °C. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was dissolved in RNase-free water and stored at -80 °C. RNA concentration was assessed by spectrophotometry at 260 nm. RNA quality was confirmed by running 5 μg of total RNA from each preparation on a 1.2% denatured agarose gel. The specific oligonucleotide primers for the RT-PCR analysis of the α-, β-, δ-, and γ-ENaC subunits were as follows: α-ENaC, 5′-AAC AAA TCG GAC TGC TTC TAC-3′ (sense), 5′-AGC CAC CAT CAT CCA TAA A-3′(antisense); β-ENaC, 5′-GGG ACC AAA GCA CCA AT-3′ (sense), 5′-CAG ACG CAG GGA GTC ATAG-3′ (antisense); δ-ENaC, 5′-CGA AGC ATG GAC GGG AGA ATG-3′ (sense), 5′-GGT GCC AGT GAC GCT CAA AGA-3′ (antisense); γ-ENaC, 5′-GCA CCG TTC GCC ACC TTC TA-3′ (sense), 5′-AGG TCA CCA GCA GCT CCT CA-3′ (antisense). Sequence accession numbers in GenBank™ are 38197484, 4506816, 34101281, and 42476332 for the α-, β-, δ-, and γ-subunits, respectively. The corresponding product sizes are 406 bp (α), 440 bp (β), 325 bp (δ), and 456 bp (γ). Custom primers specific for δ-, α-, β-, and γ-ENaC were synthesized by Sigma Genosys and used at a final concentration of 0.4 μm. RT-PCR was performed using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) in a Mastercycler gradient thermocycler (Eppendorf Scientific). One microgram of total RNA was added as a template for each reaction. Reverse transcription was carried out using a single cycle of 50 °C for 30 min. This was followed by a single cycle of 95 °C for 15 min to inactivate the reverse transcriptase while activating the HotStart TaqDNA polymerase, and then 30 cycles of 94 °C for 0.5 min, 56 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1.5 min were performed followed by a single 10-min cycle at 72 °C for extension. RT-PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel using 100-bp PCR markers (Promega) as a standard to determine the molecular size. Products of the predicted molecular size were excised and purified from the gel using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and subcloned into the pCR-2.1 vector (Invitrogen). Positive clones were selected by blue/white screening and followed by digestion with EcoRI (Promega) to verify incorporation of insert of the correct size. Authenticity of PCR products in the pCR2.1 vector were verified by automated DNA sequencing (DNA Sequencing Facility, Iowa State University). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Confluent H441 cell monolayers were grown on 12-mm diameter polycarbonate filters (Corning Costar) for approximately 2 weeks. Following fixation in 3% buffered formaldehyde for 20 min, cells were permeabilized in 0.01% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and nonspecific protein binding sites were blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Anti-δENaC (Open Biosystems, Huntsville AL) as well as α-, β-, and γ-ENaC polyclonal antibodies (prepared by Pascal Barbry) at 5-20 μg/ml for 2 h at room temperature) was used to detect ENaC protein. An 18-amino acid peptide in extracellular loop (RESAFKLSTGTSRWPSAK) was antigen for δ-ENaC antibody preparation. Cells incubated with PBS in the absence of ENaC antibodies serve as control. Nuclei were stained with Vectashield-4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Labs). Images were captured on an Olympus IX170 inverted epifluorescence microscope using SenSyscooled charge-coupled high resolution camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). Images were assembled using Adobe PhotoShop. Co-immunoprecipitation—COS-7 or H441 cells were grown in low bicarbonate Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. COS-7 cells were plated at a density of 2.4 × 106 cells in 100-mm plates 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with ∼24 μg of each cDNA construct or vector alone using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. COS-7 and H441 cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (in mm: 120 NaCl, 100 KCl, 20 EDTA, 1 dithiothreitol, 20 Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) supplemented with one protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science)/10 ml of lysis buffer at 4 °C for 1 h. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the pellet was discarded. The supernatant was incubated with 10 μg of anti-αENaC (Affinity Bioreagents) or anti-HA antibody (Sigma) to immunoprecipitate the specific proteins for 2 h at 4 °C. The supernatant of H441 cell lysates was incubated with 10 μg of anti-αENaC (Affinity Bioreagents) or anti- δENaC antibody (Open Biosystems) to immunoprecipitate the specific proteins for 2 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, 50 μl of protein A/G-plus Agarose beads was added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed for five times with the lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer, and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting (8% SDS-PAGE gel) using anti-HA monoclonal (Sigma), anti-γENaC (Affinity Bioreagents), and anti-αENaC polyclonal antibodies (Affinity Bioreagents). Single Channel Patch Clamp Assay—Unitary Na+ and Li+ conductance in oocytes was digitized from on-cell and inside-out patches isolated from vitelline membrane-stripped eggs as described previously (21Ji H.L. Bishop L.R. Anderson S.J. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8428-8440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Linear regression analysis was applied to the single channel current-voltage curves to compute the slope conductance. Data Analysis—Data were primarily analyzed with the Axon Clampfit 9.2 and further statistically computed and plotted with Origin 7.5 (OriginLab). Proton-activated Na+ current at each pH was computed by subtracting the basal current from the peak current in the presence of protons. The EC50 of external pH was calculated by fitting the acid-activated current with the Hill equation INa=ImaxpHonpHon+EC50n(Eq. 1) where INa is the proton-activated currents, Imax is the maximal acid-activated current, pHo stands for the extraoocyte pH, EC50 represents the value of pHo that results in half of the maximal current of the ENaC channel, and n is the Hill coefficient. Mean open time (MOT) and mean closed time (MCT) were calculated using the equations MOT=T·NPoe/2(Eq. 2) and Tc=NTe/2-MOT(Eq. 3) where T is the total recording time, e is the event number, and NPo have their usual meanings (22Fu J. Ji H.L. Naren A.P. Kirk K.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 459-470Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Becchetti A. Malik B. Yue G. Duchatelle P. Al-Khalili O. Kleyman T.R. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F1030-F1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because the heterologously expressed ENaC in oocytes exhibit multiple channels in each patch, the real baseline at which all of channels are silent is difficult to identify; therefore, the values of MOT and MCT were calculated based on the assumption that the lowest level during the recording period represents the closed level. All results are presented as mean ± S.E. of amiloride-sensitive currents. Amiloride-sensitive currents are defined as the difference between the total current and the amiloride-resistant current. One-way analysis of variance computation combined with the Bonferroni test was used to analyze data with unequal variance between each group. A probability level of 0.05 was considered significant. Expression of ENaC mRNA in Human Epithelia—To examine whether δ-ENaC is co-expressed with the αβγ-subunits in human epithelial cells at the mRNA level, cells that have previously been shown to have an functional amiloride-sensitive Na+ conductance were chosen for RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1, a 419-bp product was detected in human lung epithelial cells (H441), human pancreatic epithelial cells (CFPAC), human colonic epithelial cells (Caco-2), and human lung epithelial cells (A549). Sequencing of this product from each cell line indicated that the band corresponded to δ-ENaC originally cloned from human testis (GI 21752051), encoding a 714-amino acid protein. An additional 325-bp product was also present in A549, CFPAC, and Caco-2 but not H441 cells. Sequencing of this product revealed that it corresponds to a δ-ENaC isoform (GI34101282) initially cloned from human renal epithelia (9Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), which encodes a protein of 638-amino acid residues. Expression of α- and γ-ENaC was also detected in these four human epithelial cells, whereas the β-subunit was only weakly expressed in Caco-2 cells and was absent in CFPAC cells (Fig. 1). Expression of δ-ENaC Protein in Lung Epithelial Cells—To detect δ-ENaC expression at the protein level, H441 monolayers grown on filters were immunostained with a specific anti-δ-ENaC antibody followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. δ-ENaC expression was observed (Fig. 2). α-, β-, and γ-ENaC expression were also detected in H441 monolayers, in agreement with other studies (2Itani O.A. Auerbach S.D. Husted R.F. Volk K.A. Ageloff S. Knepper M.A. Stokes J.B. Thomas C.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L631-L641PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wodopia R. Ko H.S. Billian J. Wiesner R. Bartsch P. Mairbaurl H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1110-L1119PubMed Google Scholar). Cells incubated with nonimmune IgG and the secondary antibody did not exhibit immunofluorescence. Differences in fluorescence intensity may reflect variable ENaC subunit expression at the protein level and different affinity among antibodies against ENaC proteins. Similar results were seen in A549 cells. These results suggest that δ-ENaC is co-expressed with α-, β-, and γ-ENaC protein in native human lung epithelial cells. Co-immunoprecipitation of α- and γ-ENaC with δ-ENaC in H441 and COS-7 Cells—Co-expression of δ-ENaC with α-, β-, and γ-ENaC indicated that these four ENaC subunits may associate with each other to form a multiple subunit channel protein complex. To test this hypothesis, we first detected native δ-ENaC protein expression in H441 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A and in the right lane in Fig. 3C, δ-, α-, and γ-ENaC proteins were detected as 85-90 kb for δ- and α-ENaC and 150 kb for γ-ENaC. γ-ENaC was found to co-immunoprecipitate with δ- and α-ENaC (Fig. 3B). Specificity was demonstrated by Western analysis with anti-γENaC following pretreatment of the anti-γENaC antibody with excess neutralizing peptide (Fig. 3B). In addition, δ-ENaC also precipitated with α-subunit in H441 cells (Fig. 3C) and in COS-7 cells following transient transfection of HA-tagged δ-ENaC and α-ENaC. Cation Permeability—In this set of experiments, we tested the hypothesis that co-expression of δ-ENaC alters the ion selectivity of αβγ-ENaC. As shown in Fig. 3A, the inward amiloride-sensitive Na+ current was greater than that carried by Li+ ions. Much less inward and relative greater outward currents were detected when K+, Cs+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ were used as charge carriers. Meanwhile, the reversal potential shifted leftward from depolarization voltages (10-20 mV) by ∼50-150 mV. Additionally, the resting membrane potentials, which were generally above 0 mV under current clamp configuration in oocytes perfused with Na+ (or Li+), showed hyperpolarization to a variable extent (Fig. 3A). To calculate the permeability ratios between Na+ and the other cations, amiloride-sensitive current-voltage curves were fitted with the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz current equation as described previously (Fig. 3B) (20Ji H.L. Parker S. Langloh A.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C64-C74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PX/PNa ratios of Na+/Li+/K+/Cs+/Ca2+/Mg2+ were 1/0.6/0.07/0.2/0.26/0.4 for δβγ-ENaC. However, they were 1/1.2/0.02/0.29/0.31/0.21 for αβγ-ENaC and 1/0.88/0.02/0.14/0.23/0.14 for δαβγ-hENaC, respectively. Our results of wild type αβγ- and δβγ-ENaC are consistent with previously published observations (8Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C.

In particular, the normalized permeability to Li+ (PNa is 1.0) for δαβγ-ENaC was 0.88, which was distinguishable from those of αβγ-(1.2) and δβγ-ENaC (0.6). Significant differences in normalized permeabilities to the other monovalent and divalent cations was not observed between αβγ-, δβγ-, and δαβγ-ENaC channels, as shown in Fig. 4. Amiloride Sensitivity—The Ki of amiloride for δβγ-ENaC is in the micromolar range (versus <100 nm for αβγ-ENaC). Amiloride blocking of δβγ-ENaC is much more voltage-dependent when compared with the αβγ channel (21Ji H.L. Bishop L.R. Anderson S.J. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8428-8440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine amiloride sensitivity of δαβγ-ENaC, we perfused oocytes with solutions containing 1 nm, 10 nm, 100 nm, 1 μm, 10 μm, 100 μm, and 1 mm amiloride at holding potentials ranging from -120 mV to +80 mV. Fig. 5 shows that the dose-response curves shifted rightward at depolarized potentials. The Ki of amiloride at -120 mV was 920 ± 185 nm and 13746 ± 2805 nm at +80 mV, respectively, which significantly differ from those of αβγ-ENaC (p < 0.05, n = 6). To further investigate the voltage dependence of amiloride inhibition for δαβγ-hENaC, the values for Kiamil were plotted against the applied membrane potentials (Fig. 5B). The more depolarizing the membrane potential, the greater the value of Kiamil. As we have previously described for αβγ- and δβγ-ENaC, positively charged amiloride interacts with ENaC in a voltage-dependent manner (21Ji H.L. Bishop L.R. Anderson S.J. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8428-8440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The Ki of amiloride at 0 mV estimated by fitting the voltage-dependent plot with the Woodhill equation was 3.79 ± 0.2 μm for δαβγ-ENaC, whereas it was 13.1 and 0.33 μm for δβγ- and αβγ-ENaC, respectively (21Ji H.L. Bishop L.R. Anderson S.J. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8428-8440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The voltage-sensitive fractional distance for amiloride was 0.41. In comparison, it was 0.34 for αβγ-ENaC and 0.48 for δβγ-ENaC, respectively (21Ji H.L. Bishop L.R. Anderson S.J. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8428-8440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Unitary Conductance—Because the ion permeability ratio (PNa/PLi) and apparent equivalent dissociation constant of amiloride for the δαβγ-ENaC channel are the arithmetic mean of those of αβγ- and δβγ-ENaC, the question arose whether oocytes injected with δαβγ-ENaC subunits express two separate populations of ENaC, that is, αβγ- and δβγ-ENaC channels or one population of δαβγ-channels with novel biophysical characteristics. To address this question, on-cell patches were used to measure single channel conductances (Fig. 6C). Only one unitary Na+ or Li+ current level was observed (Fig. 5D), and the corresponding slope conductances, respectively, were 8 ± 0.2 pS for Na+ and 7.5 ± 0.1 pS for Li+ (n = 6). No amiloride-sensitive subconductance was observed. Gating Kinetics—We measured the MOT and MCT for δαβγ-ENaC (Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. 6, the MOT and MCT for δαβγ-ENaC were significantly less than the corresponding values for αβγ- and δβγ-ENaC. The MOT values for αβγ- and δβγ-ENaC were greater than that of δαβγ-ENaC (p < 0.05). In addition, the MCT values of αβγ-ENaC were almost 10-fold of that for δαβγ-ENaC (p < 0.05). Proton Activation—Recently, we found that δβγ-ENaC, but not αβγ-ENaC, was activated by extracellular protons (25Ji H.L. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26939-26947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To test the pH sensitivity of δαβγ-ENaC, oocytes were perfused with bath solutions with neutral or acidic pH. Similar to the δβγ-ENaC channel e"
https://openalex.org/W2056907562,"High-level circuits in the brain that control the direction of gaze are intimately linked with the control of visual spatial attention. Immediately before an animal directs its gaze towards a stimulus, both psychophysical sensitivity to that visual stimulus and the responsiveness of high-order neurons in the cerebral cortex that represent the stimulus increase dramatically. Equivalent effects on behavioural sensitivity and neuronal responsiveness to visual stimuli result from focal electrical microstimulation of gaze control centres in monkeys. Whether the gaze control system modulates neuronal responsiveness in sensory modalities other than vision is unknown. Here we show that electrical microstimulation applied to gaze control circuitry in the forebrain of barn owls regulates the gain of midbrain auditory responses in an attention-like manner. When the forebrain circuit was activated, midbrain responses to auditory stimuli at the location encoded by the forebrain site were enhanced and spatial selectivity was sharpened. The same stimulation suppressed responses to auditory stimuli represented at other locations in the midbrain map. Such space-specific, top-down regulation of auditory responses by gaze control circuitry in the barn owl suggests that the central nervous system uses a common strategy for dynamically regulating sensory gain that applies across modalities, brain areas and classes of vertebrate species. This approach provides a path for discovering mechanisms that underlie top-down gain control in the central nervous system."

The closely related analogue epirubicin induces less cardiotoxicity, but the determinants of its different behavior have not been elucidated. We developed a translational model of the human heart and characterized whether epirubicin exhibited a defective conversion to ROS and secondary alcohol metabolites. Small myocardial samples from cardiac surgery patients were reconstituted in plasma that contained clinically relevant concentrations of doxorubicin or epirubicin. In this model only doxorubicin formed ROS, as detected by fluorescent probes or aconitase inactivation. Experiments with cell-free systems and confocal laser scanning microscopy studies of H9c2 cardiomyocytes suggested that epirubicin could not form ROS because of its protonation-dependent sequestration in cytoplasmic acidic organelles and the consequent limited localization to mitochondrial one-electron quinone reductases. Accordingly, blocking the protonation-sequestration mechanism with the vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 relocalized epirubicin to mitochondria and increased its conversion to ROS in human myocardial samples. Epirubicin also formed ∼60% less alcohol metabolites than doxorubicin, but this was caused primarily by its higher Km and lower Vmax values for two-electron carbonyl reduction by aldo/keto-reductases of human cardiac cytosol. Thus, vesicular sequestration and impaired efficiency of electron addition have separate roles in determining a defective bioactivation of epirubicin to ROS or secondary alcohol metabolites in the human heart. These results uncover the molecular determinants of the reduced cardiotoxicity of epirubicin and serve mechanism-based guidelines to improving antitumor therapies.

The anthracyclines doxorubicin (DOX) 4The abbreviations used are: DOX, doxorubicin; EPI, epirubicin; ROS, reactive oxygen species; O2·¯, superoxide anion; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; DOXOL, doxorubicinol; EPIOL, epirubicinol; DCFH-(DA), dichlorofluorescin (diacetate); DCF, dichlorofluorescein; AUC, area under the curve; Amplex Red reagent, 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; NES, normal external solution. and epirubicin (EPI) are topoisomerase II inhibitors that exhibit activity in breast cancer and many other tumors (1Minotti G. Menna P. Salvatorelli E. Cairo G. Gianni L. Pharmacol. Rev. 2004; 56: 185-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2909) Google Scholar). These drugs are composed of an aglycone and a sugar. The aglycone (doxorubicinone) consists of a tetracyclic ring with adjacent quinone-hydroquinone moieties and a short side chain with a carbonyl group; the sugar (daunosamine) is an amino-substituted trideoxy fucosyl moiety. Epirubicin differs from DOX in an axial-to-equatorial epimerization of the hydroxyl group at C-4′ in daunosamine (Fig. 1). This minor difference renders EPI a much better substrate than DOX for human liver UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 and consequently facilitates the formation of glucuronides that are excreted in bile and urine (2Innocenti F. Iyer L. Ramirez J. Green M.D. Ratain M.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 686-692PubMed Google Scholar). Improved glucuronidation and body clearance alter the dose-related antiproliferative activity of EPI, as shown by the fact that the dose of EPI equimyelotoxic to 1 mg of DOX is 1.5 mg (3Bonadonna G. Gianni L. Santoro A. Bonfante V. Bidoli P. Casali P. Demicheli R. Valagussa P. Ann. Oncol. 1993; 4: 359-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A major obstacle to the clinical use of anthracyclines pertains to the development of cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure upon chronic administration. Of note, the dose of EPI equicardiotoxic to 1 mg of DOX has been approximated to 1.8 mg for cardiac symptoms and 2.2 mg for injury on endomyocardial biopsies (3Bonadonna G. Gianni L. Santoro A. Bonfante V. Bidoli P. Casali P. Demicheli R. Valagussa P. Ann. Oncol. 1993; 4: 359-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 4Ewer M.S. Benjamin R.S. Holland J. Frei E. Cancer Medicine. 5th Ed. B. C. Decker, Philadelphia2000: 2324-2339Google Scholar). Thus, EPI causes cardiotoxicity at doses higher than equimyelotoxic to DOX, as if improved glucuronidation and systemic elimination were not the only factors that diminished its noxious interactions with cardiomyocytes. Uncovering the molecular determinant(s) that render EPI intrinsically less cardiotoxic than DOX would be of conceptual value in many settings. Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is a complex multifactorial process. The current thinking is that anthracyclines are toxic per se but gain further toxicity upon conversion to reactive oxygen species (ROS), like superoxide anion (O2·¯) and its dismutation product hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). These species are formed through an enzymatic one-electron reduction of the quinone moiety, a process yielding a semiquinone that regenerates its parent quinone by oxidizing with oxygen (Fig. 1). Because of the lower levels of O2·¯- and H2O2-detoxifying enzymes in cardiomyocytes as compared with other cell types, ROS amplify the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines through oxidative stress, disruption of the cardiac-specific gene expression program, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 1Minotti G.

Anthracycline semiquinones can also disproportionate and rearrange to 7-deoxydoxorubicinolone through a concomitant reductive cleavage of the glycosidic bond with daunosamine and reduction of the side chain carbonyl group (Fig. 1). 7-Deoxydoxorubicinolone therefore serves as a biochemical marker to probe a one-electron redox cycling of anthracyclines in biologic systems (8Gille L. Nohl H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Anthracyclines may gain toxicity also after a two-electron reduction of the side chain carbonyl group and formation of a secondary alcohol metabolite (Fig. 1). The latter contributes to down-regulating cardiac-specific genes (9Gambliel H.A. Burke B.E. Cusack B.J. Walsh G.M. Zhang Y.L. Mushlin P.S. Olson R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Secondary alcohol metabolites may also act in concert with ROS and perturb the function of cytoplasmic aconitase/iron regulatory protein-1, an important regulator of iron homeostasis and redox balance in the cell (1Minotti G.

Chem. 2004; 279: 13738-13745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), studies with laboratory animals showed that overexpression of ROS-detoxifying enzymes or genetic deletion of alcohol metabolite-producing enzymes always mitigated or delayed cardiotoxicity induced by DOX (16Olson L.E. Bedja D. Alvey S.J. Cardounel A.J. Gabrielson K.L. Reeves R.H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6602-6606PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kang Y.J. Sun X. Chen Y. Zhou Z. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We considered that a reduced level of formation of ROS and/or secondary alcohol metabolites would attenuate the effects of EPI in the heart, thus explaining how EPI causes cardiotoxicity at doses higher than equimyelotoxic to DOX. In examining this possibility, several important factors need to be taken into account. For example, ROS formation in anthracycline-treated cells was often shown to reflect acute damage and nonspecific metabolic perturbances rather than a specific capability of cardiomyocytes to promote a one-electron quinone reduction of these drugs (18Gewirtz D.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 727-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (1819) Google Scholar). Moreover, anthracycline secondary alcohol metabolites are formed by enzymes that exhibit variable levels of expression in humans versus laboratory animals or in a given animal species and strain versus another (19Maessen P.A. Mross K.B. Pinedo H.M. van der Vijgh W.J. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1987; 20: 85-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Oppermann U.C. Maser E. Mangoura S.A. Netter K.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 189-195Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar); hence, the results obtained with animal models do not allow general conclusions on the level of formation of secondary alcohol metabolites in humans. Finally, the conversion of anthracyclines to ROS and secondary alcohol metabolite may depend not only on their inherent susceptibility to the action of one- or two-electron reductases but also on their different localization to pertinent subcellular compartments. To meet these concerns and obtain molecular correlates to clinical findings, we characterized the distribution and reductive bioactivation of DOX and EPI in a properly designed translational model of human heart. Chemicals—Doxorubicin, EPI, secondary alcohol metabolites (doxorubicinol/DOXOL and epirubicinol/EPIOL), 7-deoxydoxorubicinone, and 7-deoxydoxorubicinolone were kindly provided by Dr. Antonino Suarato (Nerviano Medical Sciences, Milan, Italy). Dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA), dichlorofluorescein (DCF), Mito Tracker Deep Red 633, Lyso Tracker Green DND-26, Amplex Red reagent (10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine), and resorufin (sodium salt) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Free DCFH was prepared by alkaline hydrolysis of DCFH-DA (21LeBel C.P. Ischiropoulos H. Bondy S.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 378: 227-231Crossref Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). Tolrestat was from Wyeth Ayerst Research (Princeton, NJ). Bafilomycin (type A1), horseradish peroxidase (type VI), and all other chemicals were from Sigma. Assays for Anthracycline Metabolism in Human Myocardial Strips— Small myocardial samples were obtained from 60 male and female patients (68 ± 5 years) undergoing aortocoronary bypass grafting. All specimens were derived from the lateral aspect of excluded right atrium and were routinely disposed of by the surgeons during cannulation procedures for cardiopulmonary bypass; therefore, the patients were not subjected to any unjustified loss of tissue (22Minotti G. Saponiero A. Licata S. Menna P. Calafiore A.M. Teodori G. Gianni L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1511-1515PubMed Google Scholar). Sampling procedures were in compliance with guidelines of the Institutional Ethical Committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Thin strips (<0.1 g, ∼10 mm long, and ∼2 mm wide) were carefully dissected free of fat or grossly visible foreign tissues and washed extensively in ice-cold 0.3 m NaCl. Unless otherwise indicated, the strips were reconstituted in 2 ml of fresh human plasma in the absence or presence of 1 or 10 μm anthracyclines. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C in a Dubnoff metabolic bath under an air atmosphere, the strips were washed in ice-cold 0.3 m NaCl, homogenized in a minimum volume of the same medium, and centrifuged for 90 min at 105,000 × g to separate a soluble and a whole membrane fraction. The two fractions were extracted separately with a 4-fold volume of (1:1) CHCl3/CH3OH; the organic phases were combined, and 20 μl were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC on an HP Zorbax CN column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm; Hewlett Packard Co., Palo Alto, CA) operated at 25 °C. Extracts of DOX-treated samples were eluted at the flow rate of 1.5 ml/min with a 15-min linear gradient from 50 mm NaH2PO4 to CH3CN, 25 mm NaH2PO4, pH 4.0. Retention times (Rt) were 10.9, 12.1, and 13.9 min for DOXOL, DOX, and 7-deoxydoxorubicinone, respectively. Extracts of EPI-treated samples were eluted isocratically with CH3CN, 25 mm NaH2PO4 at the flow rate of 1.5 ml/min; Rt were 5.5, 7.5, and 9 min for EPIOL, EPI, and 7-deoxydoxorubicinone, respectively. 7-Deoxydoxorubicinolone was separated by chromatography on a Nucleosil C-18 column (100 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm/Supelco, Bellafonte, PA), operated at 25 °C, and eluted with a 15-min linear gradient from 50 mm NaH2PO4 to CH3CN, 25 mm NaH2PO4 at the flow rate of 1 ml/min. Retention time was 14 min. Anthracyclines were detected fluorimetrically (excitation at 480 nm/emission at 560 nm) and quantified against appropriate standard curves. Unless otherwise indicated, all values were expressed as nmol/g (wet weight). Intramyocardial H2O2 Assay—We used a modification of the DCFH-DA method. DCFH-DA crosses the plasma membrane and releases DCFH after deacetylation by cellular esterases; in the presence of ROS, DCFH eventually oxidizes to form the green fluorescent DCF (21LeBel C.P. Ischiropoulos H. Bondy S.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 378: 227-231Crossref Scopus (2241) Google Scholar, 23Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Myocardial strips were loaded with 50 μm DCFH-DA in 4 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer, 123 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm glucose, pH 7.4. After 1 h of incubation in the dark, the strips were washed with 0.3 m NaCl and reconstituted in human plasma in the absence or presence of DOX or EPI, as described above. Next, the strips were homogenized in 2 ml of ice-cold 123 mm NaCl that was added with the antioxidant 4-hydroxytempol (1 mm) to prevent further oxidation of DCFH to DCF during tissue homogenization. Soluble and membrane fractions were extracted with 2 volumes of (1:1) CH3OH-CHCl3, and 25 μl of the upper phase were analyzed by HPLC using a Nucleosil C-18 column (100 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm), operated at 25 °C. Samples were eluted at the flow rate of 1 ml/min with a 15-min linear gradient from 50 mm NaH2PO4 to CH3CN 25 mm NaH2PO4, pH 4.0. The fluorescent peak of DCF (excitation at 488 nm/emission at 525 nm) was identified by co-chromatography with an authentic standard (Rt = 18.3 min), and its area under the curve (AUC) in membrane or soluble fractions was corrected for the corresponding AUC in strips extracted immediately after loading with DCFH-DA; the differences indicated the net level of DCF formation during 4 h of incubation of strips in plasma. To quantify H2O2 formation versus DCF fluorescence, we titrated myocardial strips with known amounts of H2O2. Briefly, myocardial strips were loaded with DCFH-DA, washed, reconstituted in 4 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer, 123 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm glucose, pH 7.4, and exposed for 15 min to 0.1, 1, 5, or 10 μm H2O2. At the end of treatments, the strips were washed and reconstituted in plasma for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. The total AUC of DCF in these samples (membrane fraction + soluble fraction) was corrected for that of strips extracted immediately after loading with DCFH-DA. The net differences correlated linearly with the concentrations of H2O2 delivered to the strips (r = 0.80, p < 0.001), and were quantified against a standard curve of 5 nm to 2.5 μm authentic DCF (r = 0.98, p < 0.0001). On the basis of this procedure, we approximated that 1 nmol of H2O2 caused the formation of 0.43 ± 0.07 nmol of DCF/g of human myocardium (n = 12); this stoichiometry was routinely adopted to quantify basal or anthracycline-induced H2O2 formation in myocardial strips. Extracellular H2O2 Assay—The Amplex Red reagent (10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine) enters the cells poorly, but in the presence of extracellular H2O2 and horseradish peroxidase it oxidizes to fluorescent resorufin (24Wagner B.A. Evig C.B. Reszka K.J. Buettner G.R. Burns C.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 440: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We therefore used this reagent to measure H2O2 that diffused out of myocardial strips. Inasmuch as plasma interfered with peroxidatic assays, the strips were reconstituted in 2 ml of phenol red-free Hanks' buffered salt solution, added with Amplex Red reagent (80 μm) and horseradish peroxidase (0.11 units/ml). After 4-h incubations in the absence or presence of anthracyclines, the medium was mixed with 1 mm sodium azide to inhibit horseradish peroxidase and was extracted with a 2-fold excess of (1:1) CHCl3/CH3OH. The methanolic phase of the extracts was analyzed by HPLC to avoid an overlapping of the fluorescence of anthracyclines with that of resorufin (excitation at 485 nm/emission at 595 nm). The HPLC procedure was the same as that described for the DCF assay, except that the mobile phase was adjusted to pH 6.0. Resorufin eluted at 9.8 min, whereas DOX or EPI eluted at 13 min. The assay was calibrated by reacting nanomolar amounts of H2O2 with Amplex Red (80 μm), horseradish peroxidase (0.11 units/ml), and by comparing the fluorescence of Amplex Red-derived resorufin with a standard curve of authentic resorufin; one molecule of H2O2 was used to generate one molecule of resorufin, and the assay had a detection limit of 2 nm resorufin. Anthracycline Metabolism Assays in Cell-free Systems—The whole membrane fraction of control myocardial strips (1 mg of protein/ml) was reconstituted with 0.5 mm NADH and 0.1-100 μm anthracyclines, in the absence or presence of 5 μm DCFH. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the incubations were extracted and assayed for 7-deoxydoxorubicinone, 7-deoxydoxorubicinolone, and DCF. The latter was corrected for DCF formation in incubations that contained only membranes and was quantified against a standard curve of authentic DCF. The soluble fraction of the same strips (0.6 mg protein/ml) was assayed for DOXOL and EPIOL after 4 h of reconstitution with 0.25 mm NADPH and 10-500 μm anthracyclines. Because high levels of DOXOL or EPIOL eventually oxidize with the [4Fe-4S] cluster of cytoplasmic aconitase, all soluble fractions were subjected to cluster disassembly with dithiothreitol, pH 8.9, prior to reconstitution with anthracyclines and NADPH (13Minotti G.

This procedure favored metabolite accumulation and calculations of pertinent kinetics. Aconitase Assay—Soluble and membrane fractions were isolated in ice-cold 0.3 m NaCl that contained 0.1 mm cis-aconitate to minimize an artifactual oxidation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster of aconitases. Next, 30-60 μg of protein/ml were assayed for aconitase activity by monitoring spectrophotometrically the consumption of freshly added 0.1 mm cis-aconitate (ϵ240 = 3.6 mm-1 cm-1) (13Minotti G.

One unit of aconitase activity was defined as the amount catalyzing the consumption of 1 μmol of cis-aconitate per min. Where indicated, the proteins were preincubated for 5 min with cysteine and ferrous ammonium sulfate (1100 or 50 nmol/mg protein, respectively); this was done to reconstitute the [4Fe-4S] cluster of aconitase and obtain maximal enzyme activity (13Minotti G.

Cell Cultures and Confocal Laser Scanning Inverted Microscopy—We used the H9c2 cell line derived from embryonic BD1X rat heart (CRL 1446; American Type Culture Collection). Cells were grown at 37 °C under 5% CO2/air in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium adjusted to contain 4 mm glutamine, 18 mm sodium bicarbonate, 25 mm glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 ng/ml streptomycin, and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Subconfluent H9c2 cells (50 × 103) were plated on 25-mm glass coverslips and maintained for 24 h in culture medium. At the time of experiments the medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with Normal External Solution (NES) containing (in mm): 125 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgSO4, 1 KH2PO4, 5.5 glucose, 1 CaCl2, 20 HEPES, pH 7.4. Next, the cells were incubated for 40 min with 10 μm DCFH-DA and 100 nm Mito Tracker Deep Red 633, a mitochondrion-specific probe (25Ramachandran A. Moellering D.R. Ceaser E. Shiva S. Xu J. Darley-Usmar V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6643-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). At the end of loading, the cells were washed with NES, transferred into an 1-ml Attofluor® (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and examined by a Zeiss LSM510 META confocal system (Jena, Germany) connected to an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a Plan Neofluar oil-immersion objective (×40/1.3 NA). After 90 s of equilibration and acquisition of base-line images, 10 or 50 μm DOX or EPI was added, and the fluorescences of anthracyclines, Mito Tracker Deep Red 633, and DCF were simultaneously monitored every 10 s using an argon laser beam with excitation lines at 488 nm and a helium-neon 633 nm source. To separate emissions of the three fluorochromes, HTF 488/543/633, NTF 545, and NTF 635 primary and secondary dichroic mirrors were used. Detector bandpass filters were set over 505-530 and 565-615 or 663-695 nm ranges for the emissions of DCF (green), anthracyclines (red) and Mito Tracker Deep Red (far red). The latter was pseudocolored dark blue. Attenuation of laser beam intensity and fluorochrome oxidative degradation was obtained through an acoustically and optically regulated filter set on the excitation beam and adjusted to 1% of potency. Where indicated, H9c2 cells were examined after sequential exposure to anthracyclines (50 μm, 20 min at 37 °C) and the green fluorescent acidotropic probe Lyso Tracker Green DND-26 (100 nm, 40 min at 37 °C). Examination settings were as follows: laser beam at 488 nm with 2% potency, HTF 488/543/633 or NTF 545 primary or secondary dichroic mirrors, bandpass filters at 505-530 or 585-615 nm for the green and red emissions of Lyso Tracker Green DND-26 or anthracyclines, respectively. Post-acquisition image analyses were carried out with a Zeiss LSM 5 Image Examiner software. Regions of interest were identified of ∼11 μm diameter in distinct cells, and their average fluorescence intensities were expressed as F-F0/F0 ratios, where F0 and F indicate fluorescences before and after anthracycline addition, respectively. Colocalizations were determined by Image J-Image Correlator Plus Plug-in® (NIH Image, Bethesda, MD) and were quantified by Pearson's correlation coefficient; values of 0 indicated no colocalization, and values of 1 indicated complete colocalization (26Manders E.E.M. Verbeek F.J. Aten J.A. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 1993; 169: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at room temperature, and each coverslip was used for no longer than 30 min. Other Assays and Conditions—Proteins were measured by the bicinchoninic acid method. Myocardial release of myoglobin, troponin T, and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB was determined by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay with an Elecsys 2010 Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics), according to manufacturer's instructions. Unless otherwise indicated all values were means ± S.E. of three experiments. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's test for multiple comparisons; differences were considered significant when p was < 0.05. Other details are given under “Results” or in the figure legends. Characterization of a Translational Model of Human Heart—Human myocardial strips were exposed to 1 and 10 μm anthracyclines. These concentrations were severalfold lower than in previous studies of rabbit isolated heart (10Olson R.D. Mushlin P.S. Brenner D.E. Fleischer S. Cusack B.J. Chang B.K. Boucek Jr., R.J. Proc. Natl.

Moreover, all experiments were reconstituted in fresh plasma from healthy donors to account for the known ability of albumin and α-acid glycoprotein to bind anthracyclines and limit their partitioning in tissues (29Finlay G.J. Baguley B.C. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2000; 45: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Under such defined conditions 1-10 μm DOX or EPI never caused myocardial damage and release of myoglobin, troponin T, and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB, which only occurred when anthracyclines were used at suprapharmacological concentrations like 100 μm (not shown). Anthracycline Steady-state Levels and Distribution in Human Myocardium—Human myocardial strips exhibited comparable concentration dependent steady-state levels of DOX and EPI (nmol/g wet weight/4 h, 1.8 ± 0.3 versus 2.1 ± 0.1 and 13.9 ± 0.3 versus 16 ± 0.9 at 1 and 10 μm, respectively; n = 3).

https://openalex.org/W1973079149,"Layer-specific innervation is a major form of synaptic targeting in the central nervous system. In the Drosophila visual system, photoreceptors R7 and R8 connect to targets in distinct layers of the medulla, a ganglion of the optic lobe. We show here that Capricious (CAPS), a transmembrane protein with leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), is a layer-specific cell adhesion molecule that regulates photoreceptor targeting in the medulla. During the period of photoreceptor targeting, caps is specifically expressed in R8 and its target layer but not in R7 or its recipient layer. caps loss-of-function mutations cause local targeting errors by R8 axons, including layer change. Conversely, ectopic expression of caps in R7 redirects R7 axons to terminate in the CAPS-positive R8 recipient layer. CAPS promotes homophilic cell adhesion in transfected S2 cells.

These results suggest that CAPS regulates layer-specific targeting by mediating specific axon-target interaction. The remarkably specific pattern of neural connections is established through a series of recognition processes. Axons are initially guided to the vicinity of their targets by both long-range and short-range cues. Once within the target region, axons then select specific cells with which to make synaptic connections (Garrity and Zipursky, 1995Garrity P.A. Zipursky S.L. Neural target recognition.Cell. 1995; 83: 177-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. The molecular biology of axon guidance.Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (2590) Google Scholar). Although much progress has been made in identifying molecules that play crucial roles in axon pathfinding and topographic mapping, relatively little is known about the molecular logic of synaptic targeting. Layer-specific innervation is a major form of neuronal targeting in the central nervous system, both in vertebrates and invertebrates. Many regions in the brain are divided into multiple layers, with different types of target neurons, making arborizations restricted to particular layers. Arriving axons thus can form specific synaptic connections by recognizing the right layer(s). It has long been postulated that cell-surface determinants present in individual layers provide cues for the presynaptic cells. Consistent with this idea, several cell surface molecules that are expressed in specific layers and thus are candidate determinants of layer-specific targeting have been identified; these include N-cadherin, Sidekicks, and EphrinA5 (Sanes and Yamagata, 1999Sanes J.R. Yamagata M. Formation of lamina-specific synaptic connections.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, Yamagata et al., 2002Yamagata M. Weiner J. Sanes J.R. Sidekicks: synaptic adhesion molecules that promote lamina-specific connectivity in the retina.Cell. 2002; 110: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, the precise roles of most of these molecules in vivo remain to be critically assessed through genetic analysis. Here, we investigated layer-specific targeting in the visual system of Drosophila, where a number of genetic tools are available to manipulate gene expression in individual presynaptic cells. The compound eye of Drosophila contains some 800 simple eyes, called ommatidia, each of which contains eight photoreceptor neurons (R cells), R1–R8. These photoreceptors form synapses in three distinct layers of the optic lobe of the brain (Meinertzhagen and Hanson, 1991Meinertzhagen I.A. Hanson T.E. The development of the optic lobe.in: Bate M. Arias A.M. The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold Spring Harbor University Press, New York1991: 1363-1492Google Scholar, Wolff et al., 1997Wolff T. Martin K.A. Rubin G.M. Zipursky S.L.

Making connections in the fly visual system.Neuron. 2002; 35: 827-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). R1–R6 cells connect to targets in the first optic ganglion, the lamina. R7 and R8 connect to targets in two separate layers of the second optic ganglion, the medulla, which allows the study of layer-specific projection. R8 axons terminate within the M3 layer of the medulla, whereas R7 axons extend into the deeper M6 medulla layer. Recent genetic analyses have identified several receptors and cell-adhesion molecules that are involved in this targeting process, including the cadherins N-cadherin and Flamingo, and the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases LAR and PTP69D (Newsome et al., 2000Newsome T.

Flamingo regulates R8 axon-axon and axon-target interactions in the Drosophila visual system.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 828-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In N-cadherin, LAR, and PTP69d mutants, R7 axons project inappropriately to the R8 target layer, whereas in flamingo mutants, R8-axon targeting is specifically disorganized. Although the mutant phenotype indicates that these molecules function in specific aspects of R-cell targeting, their expression is not restricted to particular R cells or target layers. Therefore, it has been suggested that additional layer-specific components must exist. The present study shows that Capricious (CAPS), a transmembrane protein with LRR, might function as a determinant of layer specificity in the Drosophila visual system. CAPS was originally identified for its role in neuromuscular target recognition (Shishido et al., 1998Shishido E. Takeichi M. Nose A.

Axon guidance of Drosophila SNb motoneurons depends on the cooperative action of muscular Krüppel and neuronal capricious activities.Mech. Dev. 2001; 109: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We found that CAPS is specifically expressed in R8 and in its target layer in the medulla. When caps function is eliminated in R cells, R8 axon terminals fail to stabilize in their target site. CAPS misexpression in R7 redirects R7 axons to terminate in the R8 recipient layer. In vitro, CAPS promotes homophilic cell aggregation. Together, these results suggest that CAPS mediates layer-specific targeting in the visual system. We became interested in caps function in the visual system because of its expression in both the eye and the optic lobe. We used anti-CAPS antibodies to study the distribution of CAPS protein during visual-system development. We also examined LacZ expression in the caps enhancer trap line (caps-LacZ) (Shishido et al., 1998Shishido E. Takeichi M. Nose A. Drosophila synapse formation: regulation by transmembrane protein with leu-rich repeats, CAPRICIOUS.Science. 1998; 280: 2118-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or mCD8-GFP expression driven by caps-GAL4 (caps-mCD8-GFP) to determine which cells express caps. CAPS expression was detected in the eye imaginal disc at the third instar larval stage and throughout pupal stages. CAPS immunoreactivity was present on the surface of subsets of cells in the developing ommatidia (data not shown). Only a single R cell of each ommatidium expressed caps-LacZ or caps-mCD8-GFP, which was identified as R8 by double staining with antibody to Senseless, a marker for R8 (Figures 1A and 1B). CAPS immunoreactivity was evident on R-cell axons as they exited the eye disc through the optic stalk (data not shown) and as they entered the medulla (insets in Figure 1E), suggesting that CAPS protein is expressed on R-cell axons. In the optic lobe, we detected CAPS immunoreactivity in the medulla neuropil, but not in the lamina (Figure 1C). CAPS expression in the medulla was initially uniform but became restricted to specific layers as the medulla neuropils formed layered structures during pupal development (Figures 1C–1F). We studied the correlation between CAPS expression and positions of R-cell-axon terminals during the process of targeting. R8 axons first arrive at the medulla during early pupal development and terminate in a superficial layer. R7 axons then extend along R8 axons into the medulla and terminate 2–3 μm beyond the R8 terminals. At this stage, CAPS was expressed as bands in the medulla separated by CAPS-negative regions (Figure 1D). R8 axon termini were located in the outermost CAPS-positive band, whereas R7 termini were found in the neighboring CAPS-negative band. The layered expression pattern of CAPS became more evident during mid to late pupal development, a time when the medulla neuropil develops by ingrowth of neural processes from the lamina and medulla (Figures 1E and 1F). During this period, R8 growth cones migrate from a superficial layer into deeper medulla layers and transform into synapses (Meinertzhagen and Hanson, 1991Meinertzhagen I.A. Hanson T.E. The development of the optic lobe.in: Bate M. Arias A.M. The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold Spring Harbor University Press, New York1991: 1363-1492Google Scholar). The R8 terminals extended as deep as the distal edge of the CAPS-positive band but never extended beyond the boundary to enter the neighboring CAPS-negative band. On the other hand, R7 terminals were always present within the CAPS-negative band. Thus, caps expression is closely correlated with the target-specificity of R cells, being present in R8 and its target layer but not in the other R cells and their target regions (summarized in Figure 7A). How does CAPS protein become restricted to particular layers in the medulla? It could be because neurites of caps-positive medulla neurons are confined to particular layers (restriction of neurite extention). Alternatively, it could be because CAPS localizes to layer-restricted segments of neurites that actually span a larger area of medulla (restriction of subcellular localization of CAPS). To distinguish between these possibilities, we studied the distribution of caps-mCD8-GFP that should be present on the entire neuronal processes of caps-expressing medulla neurons. The pattern of mCD8-GFP expression was indistinguishable from that of CAPS protein expression (Figure 1G). Thus, we conclude that most if not all of caps-expressing medulla neurons confine their neurites in specific medulla layers, including the R8 but not R7 recipient layer. To assess whether caps is required for R-cell-axon targeting, we examined the organization of R-cell-axon projection in the adults homozygous for a hypomorphic allele: caps65.2. We also employed the EGUF/hid system (Stowers and Schwarz, 1999Stowers R.S. Schwarz T.L. A genetic method for generating Drosophila eyes composed exclusively of mitotic clones of single genetype.Genetics. 1999; 152: 1631-1639PubMed Google Scholar) to generate mosaic animals in which the eye, but not the target, is homozygous for a null allele: caps C18fs. We used mAb24B10 staining to assess the overall R-cell projection in the adult medulla. We found that R-cell-axon targeting in the medulla is highly disorganized in caps mutants or in mosaic animals (Figures 2A–2C). In wild-type, R-cell-axon fascicles, each of which comprises an R7 and an R8 axon from a single ommatidium, project into the medulla forming evenly spaced arrays. In caps mutants or in mosaic animals, these regular arrays of R-cell-axon fascicles were disrupted. Neighboring R-cell-axon bundles often crossed over each other or fused (arrows in Figures 2B and 2C). Furthermore, the terminals of R8 and R7 axons, which are normally present in two distinct layers of the medulla, were seen in abnormal positions in the medulla. They often occupied a larger area and were located at inappropriate layers. These results suggest that caps is required in the eye for proper targeting of R cells in the medulla. Because caps is normally expressed in R8 but not in R7, the primary cause of the caps phenotypes described above is likely a caps requirement in R8. We therefore assessed the targeting of R8 in the mosaic animals with the rh5-tau-LacZ marker, which is expressed in subsets of R8 but not in R7 cells. In control animals, all labeled R8 axons projected in straight lines, perpendicular to the medulla layers, and terminated precisely at the M3 layer (Figure 2D). In contrast, in caps mosaic animals, R8 axons often extended irregularly to abnormal positions (Figures 2E and 2F). Two major types of local targeting phenotypes were observed. One was layer change, in which R8 axons terminated at abnormal layers in the medulla; they terminated either at more superficial layers than the M3 layer (8% of the R8 axons in caps mosaics [n = 92] compared to 0% [n = 162] in control, p < 0.01, Fisher's test) or at positions between M3 and M6 (22% compared to 0% in control, p < 0.01) (Figure 2E). The second phenotype reflected a local topological error, in which R8 axons extended to and fasciculated with a neighboring R-cell-axon fascicle (23% compared to 0% in control, p < 0.01) (Figure 2F). Taken together, these results suggest that caps is required for the precise targeting of R8 in the medulla. Because the R8 mistargeting phenotypes described above were observed in the mosaic animals, in which caps mutant R cells innervated largely wild-type medulla, caps is likely to be autonomously required in R8 cells. However, the EGUF/hid system employed in this study also induced small clones in the medulla (see Experimental Procedures), leaving behind a possibility that the phenotypes observed were caused by defects in the medulla. To further confirm the cell-autonomous requirement of caps in R8-axon targeting, we employed the MARCM system to induce small clones in the eye but not in the medulla. As shown in Figures 2G and 2H, small mutant R-cell clones spanning less than two ommatidia and innerving the completely wild-type medulla (as confirmed by the lack of mCD8-GFP staining) exhibited the same targeting phenotypes as observed in the EGUF/hid mosaics (5/12 mutant clones examined). These results indicate that caps is autonomously required in the R8 cell for its proper targeting in the medulla. To study the developmental cause of the phenotypes observed in the adult, we examined R-cell-axon targeting at various stages of development in caps mutants and in mosaic animals. In either case, the overall R8 axon projection was normal at the third instar larval stage (as visualized with mAb24B10, which primarily stains R8 but not R7 at this stage; data not shown). Similarly, the regular arrays of R7 and R8 growth cones appeared largely normal in younger half of the medulla at AP20 (to the left in Figures 3A and 3B). Only 5% (n = 57) of the R8 terminal were abnormally positioned or misshaped compared to 55% (n = 92) in the adults (p < 0.01). On the other hand, abnormalities were more frequently seen in the older part of the medulla at this stage (to the right in Figure 3B). At AP40, many gaps were observed in individual rows of R8 termini, with aberrant growth cones at inappropriate layers or in between neighboring axon bundles (Figures 3C and 3D). These abnormalities were very similar to the phenotypes observed in the adults. We inferred that caps is required not for the initial projection of R8 axons to the medulla but rather for their termination in the correct target region. R8 targeting defects are unlikely to be caused by cell-fate change. In caps mutant eye discs, the expression profile of the R8 markers, Senseless and Bride of sevenless (BOSS), were indistinguishable from those of wild-type (Figures 3E–3H). Furthermore, initial projection of R8 axons to the medulla was normal as described above. The morphology and position of rhabdomeres were normal, as assessed in sections of adult eyes stained with toluidine blue (Figures 3I and 3J). Differentiation of R1–R6 cells and their projection to the lamina were normal in caps mutants (Figures S1A–S1C). Overall patterning of the medulla also appeared normal in caps65.2 adults (Figures 3K and 3L). These results provide further support for the notion that caps is required for R8 targeting in the medulla but not for specification of R cells or differentiation of the medulla neuropile. To address whether caps misexpression in usually caps-negative R cells is sufficient to change their target specificity, we used a GAL4/UAS system to express caps in these cells. Expression of caps in all R cells with the GMR-GAL4 driver caused striking defects in medulla targeting. Instead of forming two distinct terminals in the R7 and R8 recipient layers, many innervating R-cell-axon bundles formed only a single terminus located at or near the R8 recipient layer, leaving the R7 recipient layer uninnervated (Figures 4A and 4B) (98% [n = 185] and 80% [n = 397] in GMR-GAL4/UAS-caps-Ia5 and GMR-GAL4/UAS-caps-Ia4, respectively, compared to 0% in control [n = 162], p < 0.01, Fisher's test). We next used an R7-specific marker, rh4-tau-LacZ, to examine the projection of individual R7 axons in GMR-GAL4/UAS-caps animals (Figures 4C–4D′). We found that most of the rh4-tau-LacZ-positive R7 axons (82%, n = 79) terminated at the R8 recipient layer. These results support the notion that the ectopic expression of caps redirects R7 axons to terminate in the CAPS-positive medulla layer. The effects of ectopic caps expression on R-cell connectivity in the medulla were not caused by changes in R-cell fate determination because the expression of R-cell-specific markers was normal in GMR-GAL4/UAS-caps eye discs (data not shown). Targeting of R1–R6 to the lamina appeared largely normal in GMR-GAL4/UAS-caps animals. Staining of third instar eye-brain complex with the general R-cell-axon marker mAb24B10 or with Ro-tau-LacZ, an R2–R5-specific marker, showed that these R-cell axons targeted to the lamina as in the wild-type (data not shown). Thus, caps expression in R1–R6 is not sufficient to change lamina versus medulla target specificity. Similarly, R8 axons were not redirected to target in the lamina, when caps expression was induced in the lamina by omb-GAL4 (Figures S1D–S1F). These results are consistent with the idea that caps is involved in R-cell-axon targeting within the medulla but not in lamina versus medulla target specificity. Because CAPS is expressed in the R8 recipient layer and can function as a homophilic cell adhesion molecule in vitro (see below), the simplest interpretation of the phenotype observed in GMR-GAL4/UAS-caps is that CAPS promoted interaction between R7 axons and the M3 target layer. However, because a high level of caps expression is induced in all R-cell axons in GMR-GAL4/UAS-caps, the observed phenotype could also be caused by increased fasciculation between R7 and R8 axons. Two lines of evidence, however, argue against this possibility. First, we found that in GMR-GAL4/UAS-caps animals, most of the R7 axons initially project to the correct target layers in the medulla, indicating that they are able to defasciculate from R8 axons. In early pupa of GMR-GAL4/UAS-caps, R-cell growth cones were present at two distinct layers in the medulla just as in wild-type (only 2.6% [n = 78] of R7 axon terminals in GMR-GAL4/UAS-caps were abnormally positioned, compared to 0% [n = 39] in control, p > 0.05) (Figures 5A and 5B). Thus, R7 growth cones extend beyond the R8 layer and reach their presumptive recipient layer normally. At 30 APF, however, many gaps were observed in the regular arrays of R7 termini, suggesting that some R7 axons were mistargeted (44% [n = 61] of R7 axon terminals in GMR-GAL4/UAS-caps were abnormally positioned, compared to 0% [n = 78] in control, p < 0.01) (Figures 5C and 5D). We infer that in GMR-GAL4/UAS-caps animals, R7 axons initially project to their target region but then retract back to the R8 recipient layer during mid-pupal development. Second, we found that misexpression of caps in R7 but not in R8 axons induce the same targeting defects as observed in GMR-GAL4/UAS-caps. We used sev-GAL4, which expresses in R7 (and in R1, R3, R4, and R6) but not in R8, to ectopically express caps. The level of expression induced by this reporter is also much lower than that induced by GMR-GAL4. Although at a lower frequency (13%, n = 112), R7 axons were mistargeted to the R8 recipient layer when caps expression was induced by sev-GAL4, indicating that ectopic expression of caps only in R7 but not in R8 is sufficient for the retargeting (Figures 4E and 4E′). Taken together, these experiments suggest that R7 targeting defects observed in GMR-GAL4 animals are due to specific changes in axon-target interaction but not to a general increase in axon-axon interaction in the medulla. Because caps is expressed both in R8 axons and in the target region, CAPS may mediate homophilic cell adhesion. To determine if CAPS can function as a homophilic cell adhesion molecule, we performed a cell aggregation assay in transfected S2 cells. We cotransfected UAS-caps and actin-GAL4 constructs into S2 cells, which normally grow as single unclumped cells with low adhesivity. caps-transfected and control cells were incubated for 1 day with gentle agitation. caps-transfected cells formed aggregates of cells consisting of more than 20 cells. In contrast, no such aggregates were found in control cells (Figures 6A–6C). To exclude the possibility that CAPS mediates S2 cell adhesion by binding to heterophilic ligand(s) present on S2 cells, we checked whether untransfected S2 cells aggregate with caps-transfected cells. Only a few untransfected DiI-labeled S2 cells were included in the aggregates formed by caps-transfected cells when incubated together, indicating that CAPS binds in a homophilic manner (Figure 6D). Different classes of R-cell axons are targeted to distinct layers of the optic lobe. The present study demonstrates that CAPS is expressed in R8 and in the medulla layer M3 where R8 axons terminate. In caps mutant animals, R8 does not precisely target to this region in the medulla. Ectopic expression of CAPS in R7 redirects R7 terminals to the CAPS-positive M3 layer. In vitro, CAPS mediates homophilic cell adhesion. These observations are consistent with the idea that CAPS mediates homophilic interaction between pre- and post-synaptic cells during the formation of layer-specific neural connections (see results of loss-of-function and gain-of-function analyses summarized in Figure 7B). Its expression in specific synaptic partners provided the first clue to the function of CAPS in the visual system. Previous studies showed that during the development of the neuromuscular system, CAPS expression is closely correlated with synaptic connectivity (Shishido et al., 1998Shishido E. Takeichi M. Nose A. Drosophila synapse formation: regulation by transmembrane protein with leu-rich repeats, CAPRICIOUS.Science. 1998; 280: 2118-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar): caps-positive motoneurons innervate caps-positive muscles, whereas CAPS-negative motoneurons connect with caps-negative muscles. Genetic analysis suggested that caps functions as an attractive target cue that guides motoneurons to the correct muscles. Thus, in the two Drosophila systems in which neural connectivity has been well characterized, caps is expressed in both partners of specific synaptic pairings and appears to mediate the interaction between innervating axons and their targets. This idea is further supported by our in vitro cell aggregation assay, which showed that CAPS binds homophilically. However, it should be noted that caps may regulate target specificity through signal transduction rather than by simple adhesion. During the formation of neuromuscular connectivity, motor axons choose among individual muscle cells present in the target region (Keshishian et al., 1996Keshishian H. Broadie K. Chiba A. Bate M. The Drosophila neuromuscular junction: a model system for studying synaptic development and function.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 545-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). On the other hand, during R-cell targeting in the medulla, afferent axons establish specific synaptic connections by selecting the correct target layer. CAPS thus can mediate cell-to-cell specificity in two different types of targeting system. Analysis of the effects of caps loss-of-function and misexpression in R cells supports the notion that CAPS functions as an attractive target recognition molecule in the visual system. In caps mutants, R8 axons reach the medulla and are initially guided to the correct layer. However, R8 axons then fail to stabilize in the target region and instead extend abnormally to nearby nontarget regions. The onset of the phenotype corresponds to the developmental stage when CAPS expression in specific layers becomes eminent in the medulla. These observations suggest that caps is required for the stabilization of the contact between R8 and the medulla layer. The same phenotype was observed in the mosaic animals, in which caps mutant R cells innervated largely wild-type medulla and in MARCM mutant clones. Thus, CAPS is required in the R cells where it is specifically expressed in R8 for proper targeting. Because CAPS is also expressed in the R8 recipient layer in the medulla, it is likely that CAPS also functions in the medulla to mediate afferent-target interaction. However, because of technical limitations, we were unable to make large caps mutant clones that include all or most of the medulla target neurons. Thus, it remains to be determined if caps is also required in the medulla for correct targeting of R8 cells. Our misexpression experiments further support the notion that CAPS mediates specific interaction between R cells and medulla layers. CAPS expression on R7 axons is sufficient to redirect them to terminate in a CAPS-positive M3 layer. Although previous loss-of-function analyses have implicated several other cell surface receptor and adhesion molecules in layer-specific targeting in this system, this is the first molecule whose misexpression was shown to switch the target specificity. Two lines of evidence suggest that the misexpression phenotype is caused by the alteration in axon-target recognition rather than that in axon-axon interaction, such as defasciculation defects. First, in GMR-GAL4/UAS-caps animals, R7 axons initially do defasciculate from R8 to reach their target region before retracting back to the R8 recipient layer. Second, CAPS misexpression only in R7 was sufficient to induce the mistargeting phenotype. Taken together, our loss-of-function and gain-of-function analyses support the notion that CAPS mediates interaction between specific R-cell growth cones and specific layers in the medulla neuropil, both of which express the molecule. Layer-specific targeting is widely observed in vertebrate and invertebrate brain and appears to provide a major means to segregate synaptic connections between specific pre- and post-synaptic cells (Sanes and Yamagata, 1999Sanes J.R. Yamagata M. Formation of lamina-specific synaptic connections.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although several axon guidance molecules have been shown to be expressed in particular layers, their roles in layer-specific targeting in vivo remain largely unknown (Sanes and Yamagata, 1999Sanes J.R. Yamagata M. Formation of lamina-specific synaptic connections.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The best-characterized cues expressed on specific layers are Sidekicks, cell adhesion molecules belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, which are expressed both pre- and post-synaptically in specific synaptic partners that project to the same layers in the retina (Yamagata et al., 2002Yamagata M. Weiner J. Sanes J.R. Sidekicks: synaptic adhesion molecules that promote lamina-specific connectivity in the retina.Cell. 2002; 110: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). When misexpressed on the presynaptic cells, Sidekicks can change their target-layer specificity. The loss-of-function and gain-of-function analyses presented in this study show that CAPS functions in a similar manner to promote layer-specific connectivity in the Drosophila visual system. These examples provide evidence for the role of local cues in the formation of layer-specific connectivity. On the other hand, as noted in the Introduction, recent studies using the Drosophila visual system have revealed the roles of several receptors and cell adhesion molecules, such as N-cadherin, LAR, and Flamingo, in target layer selection (Newsome et al., 2000Newsome T. Åsling B. Dickson B.J. Analysis of Drosophila photoreceptor axon guidance in eye-specific mosaics.Development. 2000; 127: 851-860PubMed Google Scholar, Lee et al., 2001Lee C.H. Herman T.

Biol. 2003; 13: 828-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although their expression is not layer specific, they contribute to specific aspects of R-cell targeting. Interestingly, the gain-of-function phenotype of CAPS is similar to the of loss of function for N-cadherin or DLAR, suggesting that they may participate in the same molecular mechanism that determines the target specificity in this system. Understanding how such general and cell-specific molecules cooperate to establish layer-specific connectivity will be an important subject in future studies. The Canton S strain was used as the wild-type. To visualize cellular processes of caps-expressing neurons, we crossed UAS-mCD8-GFP (Lee and Luo, 1999Lee T. Luo L. Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker for studies of gene function in neuronal morphogenesis.Neuron. 1999; 22: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar) to a caps-GAL4 line (NP3294) (Hayashi et al., 2004Hayashi S. Ito K. Sado Y. Taniguchi M. Akimoto A. Takeuchi H. Aigaki T. Matsuzaki F. Nakagoshi H. Tanimura T. et al.GETDB, a database compiling expression patterns and molecular locations of a collection of Gal4 enhancer traps.Genesis. 2004; 34: 58-61Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The caps mutant alleles used were caps65.2 and capsC18fs. caps65.2 is a deletion in the promoter region and retains 10%–20% of the normal level of expression (Shishido et al., 1998Shishido E. Takeichi M. Nose A. Drosophila synapse formation: regulation by transmembrane protein with leu-rich repeats, CAPRICIOUS.Science. 1998; 280: 2118-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). capsC18fs is a new allele of caps that contains a 7-base pair deletion, which results in a frame shift after the eighteenth amino acid. Because the predicted protein retains only the first 18 acids, most of which are within the signal sequence, the allele is likely a null. Isolation and characterization of capsC18fs will be described elsewhere (K.S. and S.H., unpublished data). The EGUF/hid system was used for mosaic analysis. FRT 2A, capsC18fs/TM6 was crossed to ey-GAL4, UAS-FLP/CyO;FRT 2A, GMR-hid, CL/TM6 (Stowers and Schwarz, 1999Stowers R.S. Schwarz T.L. A genetic method for generating Drosophila eyes composed exclusively of mitotic clones of single genetype.Genetics. 1999; 152: 1631-1639PubMed Google Scholar). Although the EGUF/hid system leads to formation of small clones in the medulla, staining with anti-CAPS antibodies revealed that CAPS expression in the R8 recipient layer remains largely intact. The MARCM system (Lee and Luo, 1999Lee T. Luo L. Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker for studies of gene function in neuronal morphogenesis.Neuron. 1999; 22: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar) was used to induce small R-cell clones. ey1x-FLP.Exel/CyO;FRT2A, capsC18fs/TM6 was crossed to actin-GAL4, UAS-mCD8-GFP;tubP-GAL80, FRT2A/TM6.

R7 and R8 axons were visualized with rh4-tau-lacZ (Newsome et al., 2000Newsome T. Åsling B. Dickson B.J.

We previously reported that Btn1p is required for vacuolar pH maintenance and ATP-dependent vacuolar arginine transport. We report that extracellular pH alters both V-ATPase activity and proton transport into the vacuole of wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Thus, coupling of V-ATPase activity and proton transport in btn1-Δ is altered. We show that down-regulation of V-ATPase activity compensates the vacuolar pH imbalance for btn1-Δ at early growth phases.

Lack of BTN1 resulted in resistance to d-(-)-threo-2-amino-1-[p-nitrophenyl]-1,3-propanediol (ANP), and this pheno-type is complemented by expression of human Cln3p, indicating that yeast Btn1p and human Cln3p likely have a conserved function (13Pearce D.A. Sherman F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6915-6918Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Resistance of btn1-Δ yeast strain to ANP was caused by an apparent decrease in the pH of the growth media brought about by an elevated ability to acidify growth medium through an increased activity of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase (12Pearce D.A. Ferea T. Nosel S.A. Das B. Sherman F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Elevated plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity results from an imbalance in pH homeostasis within the cell, manifest as an abnormally acidic vacuolar pH in btn1-Δ (12Pearce D.A. Ferea T. Nosel S.A. Das B. Sherman F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This disturbance in pH homeostasis becomes normalized through growth, most likely through up-regulation of HSP30 and BTN2, the only two genes to have altered expression through growth in btn1-Δ as compared with normal (12Pearce D.A. Ferea T. Nosel S.A. Das B. Sherman F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although deletion of HSP30 or BTN2 did not alter vacuolar pH, vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) activity was increased in both hsp30-Δ and btn2-Δ at late growth phase (14Chattopadhyay S. Muzaffar N.E. Sherman F. Pearce D.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6418-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting a direct relationship between these gene products and V-ATPase activity. In addition, by raising the acidic pH of the vacuole in btn1-Δ with chloroquine, elevated activity of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase, vacuolar pH, and increased expression of BTN2 and HSP30 were normalized (15Pearce D.A. Carr C.J. Das B. Sherman F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11341-11345Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown an involvement of Btn1p in regulating intracellular levels of l-arginine within the cell. Specifically, btn1-Δ has a deficiency in the intracellular and in particular vacuolar levels of the basic amino acids arginine and lysine. Furthermore, vacuoles isolated from btn1-Δ have a decreased ability to transport l-arginine in vitro (16Kim Y. Ramirez-Montealegre D. Pearce D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15458-15462Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, a direct role for Btn1p in l-arginine transport into the vacuole remains unclear. The V-ATPase along with ion channels and transporters maintains vacuolar pH (17Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 18Kane P.M. Parra K.J. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 81-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Graham L.A. Powell B. Stevens T.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 61-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the V-ATPase-driven proton transport is coupled with ATP hydrolysis and establishes an electrochemical gradient between the cytosol and vacuolar lumen. This gradient is used for coupled transport of metabolites such as amino acids (20Russnak R. Konczal D. McIntire S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23849-23857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Shimazu M. Sekito T. Akiyama K. Ohsumi Y. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21054-21060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and another metabolites (25Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Asakawa T. Kakinuma Y. Michael A.J. Igarashi K.

Commun. 2004; 315: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The yeast V-ATPase consists of a complex of peripheral subunits containing the ATP binding sites, termed the V1 sector, attached to a complex of membrane proteins containing the proton pore, termed the V0 sector. Interaction between the V1 and V0 sectors is essential for ATP-driven proton transport, and this interaction is manipulated in vivo as a means of regulating V-ATPase activity (18Kane P.M. Parra K.J. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 81-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, when yeast are deprived of glucose the V-ATPase complexes are disassembled into cytoplasmic V1 sectors and membrane-bound V0 sectors (27Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report that V-ATPase activity is modulated by extracellular pH, showing a down-regulation of its activity at low extracellular pH. Our results show that assembly of V0/V1 subunits is increased with the pH of the medium. Importantly, we report that btn1-Δ down-regulates ATP hydrolysis by V-ATPase, most likely to maintain normal H+ transport across the vacuolar membrane and to compensate a pH imbalance caused by the lack of Btn1p. We propose that Btn1p has active involvement in regulation of vacuolar pH and that a disruption in the function of this protein results in altered vacuolar luminal content through alterations in transport of metabolites that are usually sequestered in this organelle. Yeast Strains and Media—The B11718 wild-type strain (MATα his3Δ1 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0) was purchased from RESGEN. The KANMX system was used to delete BTN1 using homologous recombination and Cre-recombinase driven excision of the KANr cassette as described by Guldener and colleagues (28Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were grown as indicated in YNB medium (6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids/2% glucose) plus the amino acids supplement. Buffered medium was made as above but by adding 50 mm MES. The pH of the medium was adjusted after autoclaving. Measurement of Vacuolar pH—Vacuolar pH measurements were performed using methods previously described (29Ali R. Brett C.L. Mukherjee S. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4498-4506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 30Plant P.J. Manolson M.F. Grinstein S. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37270-37279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast were harvested by centrifugation after the incubation in medium at low and high pH, then 40 × 106 cells were resuspended in 200 μl of the same medium with 50 μm BCECF-AM, and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Cells were collected again by centrifugation, washed three times, and resuspended in 1 ml of the same medium. 100 μl of the cell suspension were used by determination of the vacuolar pH by fluorescence measurement. Fluorescence intensity and absorbance values were acquired using a Spectra Max M5 multimode microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Emission fluorescence at 490 nm excitation wavelength was acquired, and background fluorescence was measured using BCECF-AM-free cultures. The values were normalized to cell density (NI490) to calculate the vacuolar pH. At the end of each experiment, a calibration curve of fluorescence intensity versus pH was obtained for each yeast strain tested and growth medium used by incubating yeast cultures in experimental medium containing 50 mm MES, 50 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 10 mm NaN3, 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose, 50 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, titrated to five different pH values within the range of 4.0-8.0 using 1 m NaOH. To estimate vacuolar pH, experimental NI490 values from a given strain were compared with a calibration curve generated from the same yeast strain, as growth and the amount of dye loaded varied between strains. Yeast Cell Fractionation and Vacuole Isolation—Yeast vacuoles were obtained by using the method of Ohsumi and Anraku (22Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2079-2082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Yeast cells were grown in YNB (yeast nitrogen base) medium as indicated and then washed once with distilled water. Cells were converted to spheroplasts by suspending the cell pellet in 2 ml/g of pellet wet weight of buffer B (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 1.2 m sorbitol) containing zymolyase 20T (2.5 mg/g of pellet wet weight). Cultures were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C with gentle shaking. Spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation (500 × g for 5 min) and then washed once with buffer B. The pellet was suspended in 10 ml of buffer C (10 mm Tris-MES, pH 6.9, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 12% Ficoll 400) and homogenized by ten strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The top layer was collected in a Dounce homogenizer containing 8 ml of buffer C, and clumps were broken up by six or seven strokes. The homogenate was transferred to an ultracentrifuge tube and layered with buffer D (10 mm Tris-MES, pH 6.9, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 8% Ficoll 400). The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The top layer was collected and dispersed in a tube containing 2× buffer E (1× buffer E is 10 mm Tris-MES, pH 6.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl). Vacuoles were converted to vesicles by adding 2 volumes of 1× buffer E, and a pellet was obtained by centrifugation at 34,400 × g for 1 h. Purity of the vacuoles was verified by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with vacuolar markers. The antibodies used were: Anti-Vma2p (vacuolar membrane), anti-Vph1p (vacuolar membrane), anti-Alkaline phosphatase (vacuolar membrane), anti-Porin (mitochondrial outer membrane), anti-Dol-P-Man synthase (endoplasmic reticulum membrane), and anti-Vps10p (Golgi membrane). All the antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes and used following the manufacturer's instructions. Measurement of the Vacuolar ATPase Complex Activities—Vacuolar H+-ATPase activity (10 μg of protein of isolated vacuolar membranes in 250 μl of assay mixture) essentially as described previously (31Serrano R. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1978; 22: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The activity was assessed in the presence of sodium azide (5 mm, to inhibit mitochondrial ATPase), ammonium molybdate (0.2 mm, to inhibit acid phosphatases), and sodium orthovanadate (100 μm, to inhibit plasma membrane H+-ATPase). In addition, the activity measured in the presence of 1 μm concanamycin A (a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar H+-ATPase) was subtracted from the activity measured without the inhibitor to calculate the V-ATPase activity. Under the assay conditions used, the ATPase activity determined could predominantly be attributed to V-ATPase. The proton transport activity into the lumen of isolated vacuoles was measured by monitoring the formation of pH gradient across the vacuolar membrane by fluorescence quenching of 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (ACMA) in the presence or absence of 1 μm concanamycin A essentially as described by Camarasa et al. (32Camarasa C. Prieto S. Ros R. Salmon J.M. Barre P. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1301-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, 25 μg of vacuolar membrane vesicles was added to a cuvette containing 2 ml of reaction buffer (10 mm BisTris Propene (BTP)-MES, pH 7.0, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 2 μm ACMA). The reaction was started by the addition of 1 mm BTP-ATP (pH 7.5), and fluorescence emission signal was recorded at 480 nm after excitation at 412 nm. In Vivo Interaction between V0 and V1 Subunits of the Vacuolar ATPase Assays—Yeast cells were grown in supplemented minimal medium and harvested by centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min). Spheroplasts were generated by treatment with zymolyase 20T for 30 min in YNB medium and 1.2 m sorbitol in the presence or absence of 2% glucose. Then, spheroplasts were pelleted and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% C12E9, protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 0.67 mm dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate). The V1 domain of the vacuolar ATPase was immunoprecipitated using the monoclonal antibody 13D11 against Vma2p and protein A-Agarose beads. Samples were then separated by electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by standard techniques. Western blotting was performed using the monoclonal antibodies 8B1 (Vma2p) and 13D11 (Vph1p) from Molecular Probes, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The obtained blots were analyzed by densitometry using the software Gel-Pro analyzer version 3.1. btn1-Δ Results in an Alteration of the Vacuolar pH through Growth—We have previously reported that btn1-Δ results in an alteration of the vacuolar pH at early growth phase compared with wild-type yeast (12Pearce D.A. Ferea T. Nosel S.A. Das B. Sherman F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that btn1-Δ had a decreased vacuolar pH at 6 h of growth in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) and that, as btn1-Δ grew, after 6 h the vacuolar pH became normalized. In addition, it is well known that yeast lacking subunits of the V-ATPase complex have impaired growth in culture medium buffered at pH 7.5 or higher (33Anraku Y. Umemoto N. Hirata R. Ohya Y. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, extracellular pH could influence maintenance of an acidic vacuolar pH. To confirm this hypothesis, wild type and btn1-Δ were grown in YNB medium at starting pH values of 4 and 7.5, respectively, and vacuolar pH was measured at different time points following the method described by Ali et al (29Ali R. Brett C.L. Mukherjee S. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4498-4506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The results, summarized in Fig. 1, show that vacuoles of btn1-Δ had decreased pH (4.65) at 6 h compared with wild type (5.57) grown in YNB medium with an initial pH of 4. However, no differences were observed at the same time point in cells grown in YNB medium at pH 7.5. Wild type and btn1-Δ grown at pH 4 show similar vacuolar pH at 12 h remaining the same at 24 h of growth. However, btn1-Δ shows a slightly higher vacuolar pH than wild type after 12 h of growth in medium at pH 7, reaching values of 6-6.2 compared with 5.75-5.9 for wild-type vacuoles. Therefore, a lack of Btn1p appears to result in an altered ability to acidify the vacuolar lumen. The vacuolar pH imbalance apparent for btn1-Δ vacuoles led us to postulate that Btn1p could have a function in the modulation of V-ATPase activity. We therefore investigated whether there is Btn1p involvement in modulating V-ATPase activity. btn1-Δ Results in Decreased V-ATPase Activity Resulting in Altered H+-transport Coupling at Early Growth Phase at High pH—To further understand the role of extracellular pH regulation of vacuolar acidification, vacuole fractions were isolated from btn1-Δ cultured in YNB medium at a starting pH of 7.5. Purity of the vacuolar fractions was tested using immunological markers (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Concanamycin A-sensitive V-ATPase activity and H+-transport activity were measured at 6, 12, and 24 h of growth. The pH of the medium was monitored at the same time points. Supporting previous reports, btn1-Δ showed an increased ability to acidify the medium (12Pearce D.A. Ferea T. Nosel S.A. Das B. Sherman F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Thus, the rate of acidification of medium of btn1-Δ cultures until 12 h was 0.18 pH units/h compared with wild-type cultures (0.1 pH unit/h). Moreover, vacuoles isolated from both wild type and btn1-Δ showed an increase in the activity of ATP hydrolysis by V-ATPase with time. However, V-ATPase activity at 6 h was significantly lower for btn1-Δ, as compared with wild type, being only 20% of that for wild type at 6 h (Fig. 2B). No significant difference in the hydrolysis of ATP by the vacuolar ATPase was detected at 12 and 24 h between btn1-Δ and wild type. Proton transport into isolated vacuoles was measured by ACMA fluorescence quenching, Fig. 2C. The activity measured in wild type was relatively constant through growth. Moreover, no significant difference in H+-transport activity between wild type and btn1-Δ vacuoles was observed throughout growth in YNB medium at pH 7.5. Coupling between ATP hydrolysis and H+-transport can be expressed as the ratio between the H+ transport activity and V-ATPase activity. We plotted V-ATPase/H+-transport coupling through growth (Fig. 2D), which indicates that the V-ATPase/H+-transport coupling ratio for btn1-Δ is increased by 5 times compared with wild type at 6 h of growth. As btn1-Δ cells grow beyond 6 h, the coupling of V-ATPase/H+-transport in btn1-Δ falls to similar values to that of wild type. It is important to note that the coupling in wild type only showed slight variations throughout growth in YNB medium. These results suggest that, during the early phase of growth, btn1-Δ can regulate V-ATPase activity to keep a normal transport of protons across the vacuolar membrane and normalize the pH of the vacuole at this time. btn1-Δ Results in Decreased V-ATPase Activity and Increased Vacuolar H+-transport throughout Growth at Low pH—To further understand the role of extracellular pH on regulating vacuolar proton pumping, we repeated the previous experiments in strains cultured in YNB with a starting pH of 4. Both the wild type and btn1-Δ show lower V-ATPase and vacuolar H+-transport activities throughout growth as compared with cells grown at pH 7.5. Lower extracellular pH therefore appears to down regulate activity of the V-ATPase and vacuolar H+-transport (Fig. 2). This supports the notion that there is an extracellular pH-dependent regulation of V-ATPase activity, vacuolar H+-transport, and likely vacuolar acidification. Interestingly, concanamycin A-sensitive V-ATPase activity was decreased throughout growth for btn1-Δ as compared with wild type, although, at the later time point of 24 h, activities were very similar. Concomitantly, btn1-Δ has a higher H+-transport activity than wild type throughout growth. Thus, the V-ATPase/H+ transport coupling stayed higher in btn1-Δ compared with wild type throughout growth and in particular at the later time point of 24 h. It could therefore be postulated that a lack of Btn1p partially impairs the ability of the cell to down regulate the transport of protons to the vacuolar lumen at low pH. Buffering Growth Media to a High pH Alters the Ability of Cells to Modulate V-ATPase Vacuolar H+-transport Activities—We are studying how extracellular pH affects the maintenance of intracellular pH in both wild type and btn1-Δ. Our results demonstrate that btn1-Δ clearly alters extracellular pH at a different rate than wild type (Fig. 2A) most likely as a means to balance intracellular pH homeostasis (12Pearce D.A. Ferea T. Nosel S.A. Das B. Sherman F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The decrease in V-ATPase activity we report for btn1-Δ occurs simultaneously with an increased rate of media acidification. Thus, it could be proposed that the down-regulation of V-ATPase during the early growth phase is released when the pH of the vacuolar lumen becomes “normal” or “optimal,” such that the vacuolar compartment is at its steady state. Importantly, this “normalization” of vacuolar pH in btn1-Δ would coincide with a normalization of media acidification by the plasma membrane H+-ATPase such that btn1-Δ would behave as if it is wild type in regards to overall pH homeostasis. We therefore repeated our previous experiments in media with a starting pH of 7.5 with buffered medium to isolate the influence of media acidification in the regulation of V-ATPase complex activity. The measured proton transport into the vacuolar lumen for both wild type and btn1-Δ was similar to what we previously observed at a starting pH of 7.5 in non-buffered media (Fig. 3). Interestingly, wild type had a 50% lower V-ATPase activity after 6 and 24 h of growth compared with that in non-buffered medium (Fig. 3C). For wild type, this suggested that a constant high media pH results in a down-regulation of the regulatory mechanisms for maintaining a high or normal V-ATPase activity. For btn1-Δ at 24 h, V-ATPase activity was only 20% of the activity measured in non-buffered medium (Fig. 3C). This decrease also manifested as a 4-fold increase in V-ATPase/H+-proton coupling for btn1-Δ vacuoles (Fig. 3E). High Extracellular pH Leads to Increased Levels of V-ATPase Subunit Vma2p in Vacuolar Membranes—To test if the change in V-ATPase activity at different pH, and between wild type and btn1-Δ, was due to alterations in the protein levels of V-ATPase, the levels of two subunits of the V-ATPase, Vph1p (100-kDa polypeptide of the membrane V0 subunit) and Vma2p (60-kDa polypeptide from the cytosolic V1 subunit of the complex) were measured by Western blotting (Fig. 4). The amount of Vma2p in isolated vacuoles was 2-fold higher in strains grown for 6 h in pH 7.5 medium as compared with pH 4. However, no concomitant increase in the levels of Vph1p peptide was observed. Interestingly, our initial measurement of V-ATPase activity showed a 3-fold increase in wild type grown at pH 7.5 compared with those grown at pH 4. However, the H+-transport activity measured was more than 20-fold higher at pH 7.5. No differences in the levels of Vph1p and Vma2p were observed between wild type and btn1-Δ under any of the conditions used, including cells grown in pH 7.5 buffered medium (not shown) and cells grown in YNB medium for 12 and 24 h (not shown). Therefore, these results suggest that it is unlikely that differences in V-ATPase coupling between wild type and btn1-Δ are due to altered subunit levels of the V-ATPase. Assembly of v-ATPase Complex Is Regulated by Extracellular pH—It is been previously described that V1 and V0 subunits of the vacuolar ATPase complex assemble to form one active V-ATPase complex or disassemble to become inactive under different conditions (18Kane P.M. Parra K.J. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 81-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the V1 subunit dissociates from V0 when cells are incubated in medium lacking glucose (27Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the level of assembly of both subunits may change with the carbon source of growth medium (27Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or V-ATPase complexes lacking one of the peptides that form the enzymatic complex (34Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). E-cadherin first forms cis-dimers on the cell surface of the same cells, followed by formation of trans-dimers on the cell surface of two neighboring cells, causing the formation of AJs. The complete disassembly of AJs results in a loss of the polarized, poorly motile epithelial phenotype and the acquisition of a migratory or mesenchyme-like phenotype. As migrating epithelial cells do not always exhibit changes in the protein expression of E-cadherin (5Miller J.R. McClay D.R. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 323-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), it is probable that the cellular processes that regulate the assembly/disassembly of AJs contribute to the acquisition of migratory potential. The endocytosis of E-cadherin represents one such cellular process that could regulate cellular migration (6Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J.

Actions of HGF/SF, EGF, and FGF are mediated through their receptors (15Carpenter G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 881-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 16Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Faletto D. Vande-Woude G.F. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 251: 802-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2065) Google Scholar). HGF/SF receptor, c-Met, EGF receptor (EGFR), and FGF receptor (FGFR) are receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that are linked to the activation of many signaling molecules such as Ras small G protein and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (17Royal I.

Cell. 1998; 9: 2185-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Activation of both Ras and phosphoinositide 3-kinase has been shown to be essential for the HGF-induced cell scattering (17Royal I. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27780-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 18Potempa S. Ridley A.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2185-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). c-Met or EGFR has been shown to be colocalized with E-cadherin at the lateral membrane of MDCK cells (7Kamei T. Matozaki T.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Because signaling from RTKs can induce the internalization of E-cadherin, coendocytosis of activated RTKs and cadherins could be a novel mechanism for regulating cadherin adhesive dynamics (7Kamei T. Matozaki T. Sakisaka T. Kodama A. Yokoyma S. Peng Y.F. Nakano K. Takaishi K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6776-6784Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 21Bryant D.M. Wylie F.G. Stow J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The incorporation of RTKs and cadherins into functional complexes (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 with VE-cadherin; EGFR, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor FGFR, or c-Met with E-cadherin) is an emerging paradigm (22Cavallaro U. Christofori G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 118-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of such complexes have the potential to regulate both signaling and adhesion (22Cavallaro U. Christofori G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 118-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar).Signaling pathways of RTKs can modulate the endocytic machinery, as exemplified by the recently uncovered functional connections between Rab5 small G protein and signaling molecules (23Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L.

Cell. 2001; 1: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Rab5 is a key regulator of transport from the plasma membrane to the early endosomes. Continuous cycles of GDP/GTP exchange and hydrolysis regulate the kinetics of constitutive endocytosis (26Rybin V. Ullrich O. Rubino M. Alexandrov K. Simon I. Seabra M.C. Goody R. Zerial M. Nature. 1996; 383: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), but this nucleotide cycle can also be modulated by extracellular stimuli. Stimulation by EGF enhances the rate of endocytic membrane flow (23Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Gumusboga A. Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) by increasing the fraction of active Rab5 through stimulation of Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) RIN1 (25Tall G.G. Barbieri M.A. Stahl P.D. Horazdovsky B.F. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and down-regulation of the GTPase-activating protein RN-tre (24Lanzetti L. Rybin V. Malabarba M.G. Christoforidis S. Scita G. Zerial M. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Besides regulating receptor internalization (24Lanzetti L. Rybin V. Malabarba M.G. Christoforidis S. Scita G. Zerial M. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), RN-tre is also integrated into the EGF signaling pathway via its interaction with the EGFR substrate Eps8 and the adaptor protein Grb2, which links EGFR to mSos, a GEF for Ras (24Lanzetti L. Rybin V. Malabarba M.G. Christoforidis S. Scita G. Zerial M. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 27Martinu L. Santiago-Walker A. Qi H. Chou M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50996-51002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown previously that activation of Rab5 is involved in the HGF-induced disruption of cell-cell adhesion and subsequent cell migration through coendocytosis of E-cadherin and c-Met in MDCK cells (7Kamei T. Matozaki T. Sakisaka T. Kodama A. Yokoyma S. Peng Y.F. Nakano K. Takaishi K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6776-6784Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 12Imamura H. Takaishi K. Nakano K. Kodama A. Oishi H. Shiozaki H. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2561-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of how the activation of Rab5 is induced by HGF has not fully been understood.To elucidate this molecular mechanism, we have used a cell-free assay system of the AJ-enriched fraction from rat livers, in which the non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis is induced. We have shown here that RIN2, a member of the RIN Rab5 GEF family, transduces a signal from Ras to Rab5 in the HGF-induced endocytosis of E-cadherin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Expression Vectors—The pCMV-FLAG-RIN2 was provided by Dr. T. Katada (Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan) (28Saito K. Murai J. Kajiho H. Kontani K. Kurosu H. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3412-3418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A GEF activity-defective mutant, pCMV-FLAG-RIN2-D696A/P700A, in which aspartic acid at position 696 was replaced with alanine and proline at position 700 was replaced to alanine, was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The pCMV-FLAG-Rab5 and pEF-BOS-Myc-Rab5-S34N were constructed (12Imamura H. Takaishi K. Nakano K. Kodama A. Oishi H. Shiozaki H. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2561-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Antibodies and Reagents—The GST fusion fragment of RIN2 (amino acids 334-631) was produced in Escherichia coli, purified, and used as an antigen to raise a polyclonal antibody (pAb) in rabbits. The rabbit anti-RIN2 pAb was affinity-purified by using MBP-RIN2 (amino acids 334-631) immobilized on Amino-link agarose beads (Pierce). A mouse anti-E-cadherin (cytoplasmic portion) monoclonal antibody (mAb) (clone 36), a mouse anti-EEA1 mAb (BD Transduction Laboratories), a mouse anti-FLAG mAb (Sigma), a mouse anti-Ha-Ras mAb (clone Y13-259), a mouse anti-c-Myc mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and a mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were purchased from commercial sources. A rat anti-E-cadherin (extracellular portion) mAb (ECCD-2) was provided by Dr. M. Takeichi (Center for Developmental Biology, RIKEN, Kobe, Japan). Human recombinant HGF/SF was provided by Dr. T. Nakamura (Osaka University, Suita, Japan). Other reagents were purchased from commercial sources.Cell-free Assay for the Endocytosis of E-cadherin—The assay was performed as described (10Izumi G. Sakisaka T. Baba T. Tanaka S. Morimoto K. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, the AJ membrane fraction was prepared from rat livers as described (29Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), washed with 0.5 m Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 125 mm KOAc), and stored at -80 °C until use. The thawed AJ membrane fraction (20 μg of protein) was incubated at 30 °C in a reaction buffer (36 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.4), 0.25 m sorbitol, 70 mm KOAc, 5 mm EGTA, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm Mg(OAc)2, an ATP-regenerating system (1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.2 IU creatine phosphate kinase), 100 μm GTP, and 2.5 mg/ml rat brain cytosol). The reaction was stopped by chilling the tube on ice, and the membrane was collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The membrane was resuspended by trituration (20 times pipetting) in 50 μl of 20 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.2) and 0.25 m sorbitol, and then supplemented with KOAc and Mg(OAc)2 to final concentrations of 150 and 2.5 mm, respectively (a final volume of 60.6 μl). Immediately after the addition of KOAc and Mg(OAc)2, differential centrifugation was performed at a medium speed (16,000 × g) for 2 min. The top 42-μl supernatant fraction was harvested and centrifuged at a high speed (100,000 × g) for 20 min. Membrane pellets from the high speed spins were solubilized in an SDS sample buffer at room temperature for 30 min with vigorous shaking, and proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane sheets and immunoblotted with the anti-E-cadherin mAb (clone 36), followed by the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were developed using the ECL kit and quantitated using a densitometer Fluorchem™ (Alpha Innotech Corp.).Assay for HGF-induced Activation of Ras and Rab5—Lipid-modified Ha-Ras and Rab5 proteins were purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as described (30Horiuchi H. Ullrich O. Bucci C. Zerial M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The AJ membrane fraction (25 μg of protein) and the lipid-modified GDP-bound form of recombinant Ha-Ras or Rab5 (5 pmol) were incubated with or without HGF in Buffer B (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 12 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.06% CHAPS, 100 μm ATP, and 12 μm [35S]GTPγS (6 × 103 cpm/pmol)). After the incubation for the indicated periods of time, the radioactivity of [35S]GTPγS bound to Ha-Ras or Rab5 and the AJ membrane was measured. To monitor the amount of [35S]GTPγS bound to Ha-Ras or Rab5, we subtracted the radioactivity of [35S]GTPγS bound to the AJ membrane from the radioactivity of [35S]GTPγS bound to Ha-Ras or Rab5 and the AJ membrane. The method is precisely described in Supplemental Fig. 1.Assay for GEF Activity for Rab5 of RIN2—GEF assay was performed as described (31Yamamoto T. Kaibuchi K. Mizuno T. Hiroyoshi M. Shirataki H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16626-16634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FLAG-RIN2 and FLAG-RIN2-D696A/P700A were purified from transfected HEK293 cells as described (28Saito K. Murai J. Kajiho H. Kontani K. Kurosu H. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3412-3418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The lipid-modified GDP-bound form of Rab5 (3 pmol) was incubated at 30 °C for the indicated periods of time in a reaction mixture (50 μl) containing FLAG-RIN2 (0.5 pmol) with or without the GTPγS-bound form of Ha-Ras (0.5 pmol), 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 12 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.06% CHAPS, and 12 μm [35S]GTPγS (6 × 103 cpm/pmol). The mixture was applied to a nitrocellulose filter, and the radioactivity retained on the filter was measured.Immunofluorescence Microscopic Assay for the Endocytosis of E-cadherin—MDCK cells (5 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for 24 h and then transfected with pCMV-FLAG-RIN2, FLAG-RIN2-D696A/P700A, or both pCMV-FLAG-RIN2 and pEF-BOS-Myc-Rab5-S34N using Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen). After a 24-h culture, the cells were incubated with 10 ng/ml of HGF for 3 h. The cells were fixed, followed by immunostaining with the anti-E-cadherin mAb (ECCD-2), the anti-FLAG mAb, and the anti-c-Myc mAb. Images were captured using a Carl Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope and a 63× oil immersion objective lens (model LSM 510-V3.2; Carl Zeiss). X-Z optical sectionings were performed, and the fluorescence intensity of E-cadherin inside the cells and at the cell-cell adhesion sites was measured using the fluorescence intensity profile function of LSM 510 software. Quantification of the endocytosed E-cadherin-positive vesicular structures is presented as the ratio of fluorescence intensity (E-cadherin inside the cell to E-cadherin at the cell-cell adhesion).Knockdown of RIN2 by the RNA Interference Method—The mammalian expression vector, pBS-H1, was used for expression of small interfering RNA in MDCK cells. The following inserts were used: RIN2 gene-specific insert was a 21-nucleotide sequence corresponding to nucleotides 1177-1197 (5′-AAGAAAGTCATGCTGCTGCTG-3′) of dog RIN2 cDNA, which was separated by a 10-nucleotide noncomplementary spacer (5′-TTGATATCCG-3′) from the reverse complement of the same 21-nucleotide sequence.Other Methods—Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as a reference protein (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213195) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was done as described by Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (205964) Google Scholar).RESULTSInvolvement of Rab Family Members in the HGF-induced Endocytosis of E-cadherin—We have previously developed a cell-free assay system using the AJ-enriched fraction from rat livers, in which the non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis is induced (10Izumi G. Sakisaka T. Baba T. Tanaka S. Morimoto K. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the mechanism of the HGF-induced endocytosis of E-cadherin, we examined whether HGF affects the endocytosis of non-trans-interacting E-cadherin in this cell-free assay system as schematically shown in Fig. 1A and precisely described under “Experimental Procedures.” HGF enhanced the endocytosis of E-cadherin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). We then examined whether Rab family members are involved in the HGF-induced endocytosis of E-cadherin. For this purpose, we took advantage of Rab GDI, which forms a complex preferentially with the GDP-bound form to the GTP-bound form of all the Rab family members and extracts them from the membrane (34Takai Y. Sasaki T. Shirataki H. Nakanishi H. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 615-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). After the preincubation of the AJ membrane fraction with Rab GDI for 30 min, increasing concentrations of Rab GDI decreased the amount of endocytosed E-cadherin (Fig. 1C). This pretreatment of the AJ membrane fraction with Rab GDI inhibited the HGF-induced endocytosis of E-cadherin (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that the substrate small G proteins for Rab GDI is involved in the HGF-induced endocytosis of E-cadherin.Involvement of Rab5 in the HGF-induced Endocytosis of E-cadherin—We examined which substrate Rab proteins show this effect. The GTPγS-bound form of recombinant Rab5 or Rab3 was added to the AJ membrane fraction pretreated with Rab GDI, and the extent of the endocytosis of E-cadherin was measured (Fig. 2A). The GTPγS-bound form of Rab5, but not that of Rab3, rescued the inhibitory effect of Rab GDI on the endocytosis of E-cadherin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, B and C). These results indicate that at least Rab5 is involved in the HGF-induced endocytosis of E-cadherin.FIGURE 2Involvement of Rab5 in the HGF-induced endocytosis of E-cadherin. A, flow diagram of the steps of the cell-free assay system and schematic morphologies of the AJ membrane fraction. Ppt, pellet; Sup, supernatant. B, rescue from the inhibitory effect of Rab GDI on the endocytosis of E-cadherin by Rab5. The AJ membrane fraction was first incubated with GST-Rab GDI and collected. The collected membrane was restored by adding the GTPγS-bound form of Rab5 at the indicated concentrations and assayed for the endocytosis of E-cadherin as described in A. 1 and 2 indicate the sequence of the incubation. C, no rescue from the inhibitory effect of Rab GDI on the endocytosis of E-cadherin by Rab3. The AJ membrane fraction was first incubated with GST-Rab GDI and collected. The collected membrane was restored by adding the GTPγS-bound form of Rab3 at the indicated concentrations and assayed for the endocytosis of E-cadherin as described in A. 1 and 2 indicate the sequence of the incubation. The amount of E-cadherin in the endocytosed vesicles (70% of total SDS solubilized membrane) was quantitated by immunoblotting with the anti-E-cadherin mAb. The quantification of immunoblot is shown as the mean (±S.D.) of duplicate assays in the lower panel. Asterisks indicate statistical significance (Student's t test; *, p < 0.05). The results shown in all panels are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Activation of Rab5 by HGF in a Ras-dependent Manner—We examined whether HGF induces activation of Rab5 in our assay system. We incubated the AJ membrane fraction with the GDP-bound form of Rab5 and [35S]GTPγS in the presence or absence of HGF. HGF enhanced exchange of Rab5 from the GDP-bound to the GTP-bound form in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Several studies have revealed that HGF induces activation of Ras, which is required for cell-cell disruption and subsequent cell scattering (17Royal I. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27780-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 18Potempa S. Ridley A.J. Mol. Biol.

We incubated the AJ membrane fraction with the GDP-bound form of Ha-Ras and [35S]GTPγS in the presence or absence of HGF. HGF enhanced exchange of Ha-Ras from the GDP-bound to the GTP-bound form in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). To understand the relationship between Ras and Rab5, we examined the effect of inactivation of Ras on the HGF-induced activation of Rab5. GST-Ras binding domain (RBD) of Raf, a specific inhibitor of the GTP-bound form of Ras (35Guo F.F. Kumahara E. Saffen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25568-25581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), inhibited the HGF-induced activation of Rab5 (Fig. 4A). The blocking Ab against Ras similarly inhibited the HGF-induced activation of Rab5 (Fig. 4B). In addition, we examined the effects of GST-RBD on the HGF-induced endocytosis of E-cadherin as shown in Fig. 5A. GST-RBD inhibited the HGF-induced endocytosis of E-cadherin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). The blocking Ab against Ras similarly inhibited the HGF-induced endocytosis of E-cadherin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that HGF induces the activation of Rab5 in a Ras-dependent manner.FIGURE 3Induction of activation of Rab5 and Ras by HGF. A, induction of activation of Rab5 by HGF.

In the extracellular matrix of these tissues DMP1 is present as fragments representing the NH2-terminal (37 kDa) and COOH-terminal (57 kDa) portions of the cDNA-deduced amino acid sequence. During our separation of bone noncollagenous proteins, we observed a high molecular weight, DMP1-related component (designated DMP1-PG). We purified DMP1-PG with a monoclonal anti-DMP1 antibody affinity column. Amino acid analysis and Edman degradation of tryptic peptides proved that the core protein for DMP1-PG is the 37-kDa fragment of DMP1. Chondroitinase treatments demonstrated that the slower migration rate of DMP1-PG is due to the presence of glycosaminoglycan. Quantitative disaccharide analysis indicated that the glycosaminoglycan is made predominantly of chondroitin 4-sulfate. Further analysis on tryptic peptides led us to conclude that a single glycosaminoglycan chain is linked to the core protein via Ser74, located in the Ser74-Gly75 dipeptide, an amino acid sequence specific for the attachment of glycosaminoglycans. Our findings show that in addition to its existence as a phosphoprotein, the NH2-terminal fragment from DMP1 occurs as a proteoglycan. Amino acid sequence alignment analysis showed that the Ser74-Gly75 dipeptide and its flanking regions are highly conserved among a wide range of species from caiman to the Homo sapiens, indicating that this glycosaminoglycan attachment domain has survived an extremely long period of evolution pressure, suggesting that the glycosaminoglycan may be critical for the basic biological functions of DMP1.

Young M.F. Fedarko N.S. Biochem. Biophys, Res, Commun. 2001; 280: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Although originally postulated to be dentin-specific, DMP1 expression was later detected in bone (3MacDougall M. Gu T.T. Luan X. Simmons D. Chen J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), brain (4Hirst K.L. Ibaraki-O'Connor K. Young M.F. Dixon M.J. J. Dent.

Evol. 2000; 50: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The characteristic feature of DMP1 is that it contains an unusually large number of acidic domains, a property that would be consistent with a role in regulating matrix mineralization (1George A. Sabsay B. Simonlan P.A.L. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This purported biological function is supported by observations that transgenic MC3T3-E1 cells overexpressing DMP1 demonstrated higher levels of in vitro mineralization (9Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Findings from gene knock-out mice further indicate a role for DMP1 in mineralization; mice lacking the Dmp1 gene demonstrate profound defects in bone and dentin mineralization (10Ye L. MacDougall M.

The observation that the expression of DMP1 in osteocytes is elevated by mechanical stress suggests that this molecule may be involved in the mechanical transduction pathways (12Gluhak-Heinrich J. Ye L. Bonewald L.F. Feng J.Q. MacDougall M. Harris S. Pavlin D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).Other in vitro studies indicate that DMP1 may have non-mineralization-related functions. DMP1 secreted into the blood binds Factor H and blocks the alternative complement pathway, thus protecting cells from attack by the lytic activity of the pathway (13Jain A. Karadag A. Fohr B. Fisher L.W. Fedarko N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13700-13708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). More recently, in vitro studies showed that DMP1 binds the latent form of matrix metalloproteinase 9 and, thus, activates this enzyme (14Fedarko N.S. Jain A. Karadag A. Fisher L.W. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar).Recent protein structural analyses show that DMP1 is naturally present in bone and dentin extracellular matrix (ECM) as proteolytically processed fragments; that is, a 37-kDa fragment from the NH2-terminal portion and a 57-kDa fragment from the COOH-terminal region of DMP1 (15Qin C. Brunn J.C Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Malone J.P. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34700-34708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The data indicate that the proteolytic processing of rat DMP1 results from cleavages at the NH2 terminus of four aspartic acid residues. This pattern of cleavage specificity is strikingly similar to that taking place with dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), where post-translational processing occurs at the NH2 terminus of two highly conserved aspartic acid residues, giving rise to dentin sialoprotein from the NH2 terminus and dentin phosphoprotein, representing the COOH terminus (16Qin C. Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 904-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Recombinant DMP1 has been synthesized and used for functional studies (14Fedarko N.S. Jain A. Karadag A. Fisher L.W. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 17Kulkarni G.V. Chen B. Malone J.P. Narayanan A.S. George A. Arch. Oral Biol. 2000; 45: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Narayanan K. Ramachandran A. Hao J. He G. Park K.W. Cho M. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17500-17508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Although recombinant DMP1 made in eukaryotic cell lines can be post-translationally modified, these cells may not provide a microenvironment that exactly mimics the biosynthetic and transport environments in bone or dentin cells. Hence, there is a necessity for isolating forms of DMP1 from bone or dentin, fully characterizing them and performing functional studies using these natural derivatives. In searching for naturally occurring forms of DMP1 in the ECM of bone, we observed a high molecular weight component that eluted late in the salt gradient during DEAE-Sephacel chromatography and that was immunoreactive with anti-DMP1 antibodies. We recently purified this high molecular weight component using a monoclonal anti-DMP1 antibody affinity column. Further analysis revealed that this component is a proteoglycan (PG) consisting of the NH2-terminal fragment of DMP1 (i.e. 37-kDa fragment) with a chondroitin sulfate chain attached through Ser74. We have designated this newly discovered proteoglycan as DMP1-PG.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExtraction and Initial Chromatographic Separation of Bone Noncollagenous Proteins—ECM proteins were extracted from rat long bone with EDTA in guanidinium-HCl by standard procedures as described (19Butler W.T. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 255: 290-303Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Initially, the extracts were first subjected to gel chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 (Amersham Biosciences) to separate a group of higher molecular weight proteins from smaller-sized proteins; the latter eluted in an included volume. With DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences) ion-exchange chromatography, the high molecular weight protein fraction was next separated into seven major fractions that were named D1, D2, D3, D4a, D4b, D5a, and D5b, corresponding to the elution gradient ranging from 0 to ∼0.55 m NaCl in 6 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2 (20Qin C. Brunn J.C. Jones J. George A. Ramachandran A. Gorski J.P. Butler W.T. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 2001; 109: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The last portion of the DEAE chromatogram (i.e. D5b) containing DMP1-PG was divided into seven subfractions, which were pooled and dialyzed against water for 48 h, lyophilized, and used for the final purification of DMP1-PG using an anti-DMP1 antibody affinity column.SDS-PAGE and Western Immunoblotting—Protocols for SDS-PAGE (5–15% or 5–20% gradient gels) essentially followed the methods of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205821) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized with Stains-All staining or Western immunoblotting using anti-DMP1 monoclonal antibody (clone 9B6.3, see below) at a dilution of 1:5000. Western immunoblotting was performed using the Aurora Chemiluminescent Western blot kit (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions.Generation of Monoclonal Anti-DMP1 Antibodies—For the generation of anti-DMP1 monoclonal antibodies, the NH2-terminal fragment of DMP1 (37-kDa fragment) isolated from rat long bone (15Qin C. Brunn J.C Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Malone J.P. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34700-34708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was injected into the foot pad of BALB/c mice. Lymphocytes from local lymph nodes were fused with P3 myeloma cells. Fusion cells showing a positive reaction to 37-kDa fragment were screened and cloned. Totally, we obtained more than 12 positive clones. In the present study clone 9B6.3, with an isotype of IgG2b, was used since it showed a strong reaction to DMP1-PG. Clone 9B6.3 was expanded in the abdominal cavity of nude mice, and the antibody in ascites fluid was purified with a protein G column (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN). The titer of this purified product, as estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was 1:40,000. This monoclonal antibody was used to perform Western immunoblotting for pinpointing chromatographic fractions containing DMP1-related components and to make an affinity column for purifying DMP1-PG.Purification of DMP1-PG with an Anti-DMP1 Antibody Affinity Column—Western immunoblots utilizing the monoclonal anti-DMP1 antibody (Fig. 1B) detected the DMP1-related components eluting in the later, high [Cl-] portion of the ion-exchange chromatogram. The co-elution of DMP1-PG with bone sialoprotein and other proteoglycans made its purification extremely difficult using traditional chromatographic approaches. After the initial separation with DEAE ion-exchange chromatography, which completely eliminated the 37-kDa fragment from DMP1-PG, we used an affinity column composed of monoclonal anti-DMP1 37-kDa fragment antibody (9B6.3) coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma) for final purification. After application of the pooled fractions onto the anti-DMP1 antibody affinity column, it was washed with 10 column volumes of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. No anti-DMP1 antibody-reactive material was detected in the last washing eluant. After the extensive washing, we first tried to elute the bound fraction by glycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.5, but were unsuccessful in getting the attached DMP1-PG off the column. Then we used 4 m guanidinium-HCl (Sigma), pH 6.0, as a buffer to elute this bound fraction (DMP1-PG). The antibody affinity column could be used for at least four runs without significant loss of binding affinity for DMP1-PG. The final eluates were dialyzed against water for 72 h with 3 changes per day, lyophilized, reconstituted in water, and used for a series of analyses. The identity of DMP1-PG as a protein core of the 37-kDa fragment from DMP1, containing a chondroitin sulfate chain, was elucidated by a series of careful analyses: Stains-All staining, chondroitinase digestion, amino acid analysis, and tryptic peptide sequencing, as detailed below.Amino Acid Analysis—For amino acid analysis, aliquots from a DMP1-PG sample in water were dried, hydrolyzed by HCl gas (6 m HCl), and analyzed with an ABI 420A amino acid analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Three independent analyses were performed, and average values were calculated. Results from amino acid analysis were then used to calculate values for each amino acid of the core protein. The results of these amino acid analyses for DMP1-PG were normalized and compared with those of the 37-kDa fragment and the 57-kDa fragment. Based on amino acid analysis, the molar concentration of DMP1-PG (equal to that of the core protein) in the water solution was determined, and this value was used to calculate the number of phosphates, sulfates, sialic acids, and disaccharides for each mole of DMP1-PG.Phosphate, Sulfate, Sialic Acid, and Disaccharide Analyses—The analyses for protein-associated phosphates, sulfates, sialic acids, and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) disaccharides were performed by the Glycotechnology Core Facility of the University of California at San Diego (La Jolla, CA). A brief description of protocols employed for these analyses is given in the following.For phosphate and sulfate analysis, DMP1-PG samples in 200 μl of 0.03 n HCl were dried in an oven at 100 °C, pyrolyzed in an open flame for about 15 s, cooled to room temperature, and dissolved in 100 μl of water. A standard and a blank were also prepared in the same manner. Anion chromatography of phosphate and sulfate was performed using Ion Pac AS4A-SC column (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). Samples were eluted in an isocratic mobile phase using 1.7 mm NaHCO3, 1.8 mm Na2CO3 at 2 ml/min for 20 min. A conductivity detector was used to identify and quantify the phosphate and sulfate contents in the samples.For sialic acid analysis, sialic acids bound to DMP1-PG were released by hydrolysis with 2 m acetic acid at 80 °C for 3 h. The released sialic acids were derivatized with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene to yield a fluorescent adduct. The 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene-derivatized sialic acids were analyzed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an Acclaim 120 C18 column (Dionex) at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min and employing a gradient of 8–11% acetonitrile in methanol (7%) and water over 40 min. The eluent was monitored with on-line fluorescence detection. The identification and quantitation of 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene-derivatized sialic acids were done by comparison with the derivatized standards.For disaccharide analysis, the GAG in DMP1-PG was first released from core protein by β-elimination by incubating samples in a solution containing 1 m sodium borohydride and 0.5 n NaOH at 4 °C overnight. After neutralization with 1 m HCl, the samples were desalted by a PD-10 column (Sephadex G25M, Amersham Biosciences). Then the GAG-containing samples were incubated with chondroitinase ABC in reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 8.0) at 37 °C overnight to liberate chondroitin disaccharides. The lyase-generated chondroitin disaccharides were separated by HPLC using reversed-phase C18 column. After separation by HPLC, chondroitin disaccharides were derivatized for fluorescence detection by mixing 2-cyanoacetamide (1%) and 250 mm NaOH in the eluent stream using Eldex duel channel pump. The eluent after the post-column mixing was passed through a heated Eppendorf TC-40 reaction coil and then to a Jasco fluorescence detector set at excitation λ 346 nm and emission λ 410 nm. The disaccharides were identified and quantified using standard mixture of disaccharides.Aliquots taken from the DMP1-PG sample solution applied for amino acid analysis were used for these analyses; three independent values for each sample were obtained and averaged for calculating the contents of each protein-bound component. The molar concentrations of the four components for each sample were used to calculate the number of phosphates, sulfates, sialic acids, and disaccharides for each mole of DMP1-PG using the molar concentration of the core protein obtained from amino acid analysis as a denominator.Treatment with Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC), Chondroitinase AC (ChAC), and Chondroitinase B (ChB)—Thirty μg of DMP1-PG was incubated with 0.02 units of protease-free ChABC (Sigma) in reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 60 mm sodium acetate, pH 8.0, and 0.02% protease-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma). For chondroitinase AC digestion, 30 μg of DMP1-PG was incubated with 0.02 units of protease-free ChAC (Sigma) in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, containing 0.01% bovine serum albumin. The digestion with ChABC or ChAC was carried out at 37 °C for 2 h. The same amount of DMP1-PG without the addition of ChABC or ChAC was incubated in the same manner and served as a negative control. For chondroitinase B treatment, 30 μg of DMP1-PG was incubated with 0.1 unit of protease-free ChB (Sigma) in reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 20 min. The same amount of DMP1-PG without the addition of ChB was incubated under the same conditions and served as a negative control. Chondroitin B (i.e. dermatan sulfate; Sigma) was digested with ChB in the same manner and served as a positive control; degradation of chondroitin B into disaccharides was monitored by measuring UV absorbance at 232 nm.Trypsin Digestion, Peptide Purification, and Sequence Analysis—To identify the protein component to which the GAG side chain was attached, we analyzed the peptides released after trypsin digestion. Initially, DMP1-PG was dephosphorylated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) attached to 150 μm oxirane-activated macroporous acrylic beads. We had previously shown dephosphorylation to be necessary for the effective proteolytic digestion of 37- and 57-kDa fragments (15Qin C. Brunn J.C Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Malone J.P. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34700-34708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Eight hundred μg of DMP1-PG was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in the presence of 8 units of alkaline phosphatase in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After dephosphorylation, samples were digested overnight at 37 °C with trypsin (Roche Applied Science) at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:50 (by weight) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Before the addition of trypsin, the chymotrypsin inhibitor l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (Roche Applied Science) was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml to inhibit possible chymotrypsin activity. For comparison, the rat bone 37-kDa fragment, digested in the same manner, served as a control.Tryptic peptides from DMP1-PG and from the 37-kDa fragment were separated using a two-dimensional approach. In the first phase peptides were separated according to size on Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated and eluted at 0.5 ml/min in 4 m guanidinium-HCl (Sigma), pH 6.0, using fast protein liquid chromatography. The 30-ml elution volume was collected as 60 fractions of 0.5 ml each. The tryptic peptide profiles for the 37-kDa fragment and those of DMP1-PG were very similar except for a major GAG-containing peak in the void volume (6–7.5 ml) of the DMP1-PG chromatogram.For detailed comparisons, selected tryptic peptides from DMP1-PG and the 37-kDa fragment were subjected to a second phase of separation; that is, HPLC, as previously described (15Qin C. Brunn J.C Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Malone J.P. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34700-34708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Purified peptides from HPLC were sequenced by Edman degradation and/or by mass spectrometry as previously reported. Because the HPLC separation profiles of DMP1-PG tryptic peptides were identical to those of the 37-kDa fragments that were fully characterized previously (15Qin C. Brunn J.C Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Malone J.P. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34700-34708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we were able to accurately pinpoint the HPLC peaks that represented the NH2 terminus, middle region, and COOH terminus of the DMP1-PG amino acid sequence.Clear evidence concerning the site of attachment of GAG chain to DMP1-PG was obtained by characterizing the void volume fraction of the Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column. This DMP1-PG tryptic peptide sample was treated with ChABC, and the digestion products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Stains-All staining. The amino acid sequences of the GAG-containing peptides in the void volume fraction of the Superdex 75 column were ascertained by Edman degradation.RESULTSDetection of DMP1-PG—The presence of DMP1-PG in the later, high [Cl-] portion of the ion-exchange chromatogram of bone extract (i.e. fraction D5b) was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and detected with Stains-All (Fig. 1A) and with Western immunoblots using anti-DMP1 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1B). DMP1-PG occurred as a series of broad bands migrating at different rates, corresponding to ∼110 kDa in the earliest subfraction (Fig. 1A, lane 1) and progressing up to ∼160 kDa in the last subfraction (Fig. 1A, lane 7). The anti-DMP1 monoclonal antibody raised against the 37-kDa fragment clearly recognized these bands migrating at varying rates in different subfractions. Protein smears migrating between 37 and 110 kDa were also reactive with the antibody, but they were in comparatively minor amounts.Purification of DMP1-PG—As shown in Fig. 2, DMP1-PG pooled from seven subfractions of D5b, which attached to the monoclonal anti-DMP1 antibody affinity column, could be recovered by washing the column with guanidinium-HCl. This antibody affinity preparation detected a broad series of immunoreactive bands migrating between ∼37 and ∼160 kDa on 5–15% SDS-PAGE; the major bands were between ∼110 and ∼160 kDa. Despite the apparent heterogeneity, the protein portion of this DMP1-PG sample was solely derived from the NH2 terminus of DMP1, corresponding to the 37-kDa fragment (15Qin C. Brunn J.C Cook R.G.

Chem. 2003; 278: 34700-34708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), as shown by amino acid analysis and peptide sequencing. Western immunoblots using goat anti-mouse IgG and excluding primary anti-DMP1 antibodies demonstrated the absence of mouse IgG contaminants in the purified DMP1-PG sample, and thus, we concluded that there was no IgG leakage from the affinity column (data not shown).FIGURE 2Purification of DMP1-PG.

We focused on a recently proposed catalytic mechanism that involves a non-metal-binding water nucleophile in the active site of the monozinc CphA. Both theoretical models identified a single transition state featuring nearly concomitant nucleophilic addition and elimination steps, and the activation free energy from the potential of mean force calculations was estimated to be ∼14 kcal/mol. The theoretical results also identified the general base for activating the water nucleophile to be the metal-binding Asp-120 rather than His-118, as suggested earlier. The protonation of Asp-120 leads to cleavage of the Oδ2-Zn coordination bond, whereas the negatively charged nitrogen leaving group resulting from the ring opening replaces Asp-120 as the fourth ligand of the sole zinc ion. The electrophilic catalysis by the metal ion provides sufficient stabilization for the leaving group to avoid a tetrahedral intermediate.

The excessive use and abuse of β-lactam antibiotics have accelerated the spread of drug-resistant bacterial strains. The unprecedented level of antibiotic resistance threatens to destroy their efficacy in treating infectious diseases, posing a grand challenge to public health (1Neu H.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1064-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). The primary defense strategy adopted by bacteria is to deactivate the antibiotics by hydrolytic cleavage of the β-lactam ring, catalyzed by β-lactamases (2Fisher J.F. Meroueh S.O. Mobashery S. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 395-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). These enzymes can be divided into four classes (3Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). Enzymes in classes A, C, and D utilize an active site serine in the covalent catalysis of the β-lactam hydrolysis, whereas class B consists of metalloenzymes with one or two zinc cofactors. Although the catalytic mechanism of the serine-based enzymes is relatively well established (2Fisher J.F. Meroueh S.O. Mobashery S. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 395-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), our understanding of class B β-lactamases is less developed (4Wang Z. Fast W. Valentine A.M. Benkovic S.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Metallo-β-lactamases often have very broad substrate spectra (5Bush K. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1998; 27: S48-S53Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) stemming apparently from the metal-dependent catalytic mechanism. Despite much effort, no clinically effective inhibitor has been found. On the other hand, increasing evidence in recent years has pointed to rapid proliferation of these metalloenzymes in pathogenic microorganisms (6Livermore D.M. Woodford N. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Hence, these enzymes represent a potentially more potent threat to the existing arsenal of β-lactam antibiotics than other classes of β-lactamases (5Bush K. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1998; 27: S48-S53Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 6Livermore D.M. Woodford N. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Class B β-lactamases can be further separated into three subclasses. Despite considerable sequence diversity (4Wang Z. Fast W. Valentine A.M. Benkovic S.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), their catalytic scaffolds are relatively conserved. All class B β-lactamases have two potential metal binding sites (7Carfi A.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10173-10180Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Protein ligands in the so-called Zn1 site include three His residues in the B1 and B3 subclasses, but a His residue is replaced by Asn in B2 subclass β-lactamases. The Zn2 site has an Asp-Cys-His triad in the B1 and B2 subclasses, and the Cys residue is substituted by His in the B3 subclass. It is well established that B1 and B3 subclass β-lactamases are catalytically active with one zinc cofactor, typically in the Zn1 site (7Carfi A. Pares S. Duee E. Galleni M. Duez C. Frere J.-M. Dideberg O. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), and the second zinc typically enhances the catalytic activity (11Orellano E.G. Girardini J.E. Cricco J.A. Ceccarelli E.A. Vila A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10173-10180Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 12Wang Z. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1853-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the second zinc ion inhibits, rather than enhances, the catalytic activity of subclass B2 enzymes (15Valladares H.M. Felici A. Weber G. Adolph H.W. Zeppezauer M. Rossolini G.M. Amicosante G. Frere J.-M. Galleni M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11534-11541Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), which are only found in Aeromonas and have a strong preference toward carbapenems (6Livermore D.M. Woodford N. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the catalytic zinc cofactor in B2 β-lactamases occupies the Zn2 site, as demonstrated by recent experiments (15Valladares H.M. Felici A. Weber G. Adolph H.W. Zeppezauer M. Rossolini G.M. Amicosante G. Frere J.-M. Galleni M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11534-11541Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 16Crawford P.A. Yang K.-W. Sharma N. Bennett B. Crowder M.W.

Biol. 2005; 345: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Until recently, it was generally believed that the nucleophile in the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by class B β-lactamases is a metal-bound hydroxide (4Wang Z. Fast W. Valentine A.M. Benkovic S.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by several x-ray structures of B1 and B3 β-lactamases, in which an oxygen moiety was observed to coordinate with one or both zinc ions (7Carfi A. Pares S. Duee E. Galleni M. Duez C. Frere J.-M. Dideberg O. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 8Concha N.O. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O.

Biol. 1998; 284: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). However, a recent atomic resolution structure of a subclass B2 β-lactamase (CphA from Aeromonas hydrophila (15Valladares H.M. Felici A. Weber G. Adolph H.W. Zeppezauer M. Rossolini G.M. Amicosante G. Frere J.-M. Galleni M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11534-11541Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar)) implicated a non-metal-binding active site water (17Garau G. Bebrone C. Anne C. Galleni M. Frere J.-M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Based on the structures of the enzyme in its native form and complexed with a hydrolysis intermediate, a mechanism advocating the nucleophilic role of this active site water was advanced by Garau et al. (17Garau G. Bebrone C. Anne C. Galleni M. Frere J.-M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This mechanism is very different from the conventional model based on a zinc-bound OH-. Given the unique sequence, substrate profile, and binding pattern of the sole zinc cofactor of subclass B2 β-lactamases, however, this alternative mechanism is not unreasonable but certainly requires more detailed investigations in both theoretical and experimental fronts. We report here a detailed theoretical investigation on the catalytic mechanism of the CphA enzyme in hydrolyzing a carbapenems antibiotic (biapenem). It dovetails our recent work on the Michaelis complex of the same system using a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) 2The abbreviations used are: QM/MM, quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical; DFT, density functional theory; SSC-DFTB, self-consistent charge density functional tight binding; B3LYP, Becke-3-Lee-Yang-Parr; PMF, potential of mean force; MD, molecular dynamics; TS, transition state; EI, enzyme-intermediate; ES, enzyme substrate. method and density functional theory (DFT) (18Xu D. Zhou Y. Xie D. Guo H. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 6679-6689Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We focus on the initial nucleophilic substitution step of the catalytic hydrolysis reaction and examine the putative nucleophilic role of the non-metal-binding water in the proposed mechanism using the same theoretical methods. DFT Model—The truncated active site includes the zinc ion and its three protein ligands His-263, Cys-221, and Asp-120, approximated respectively by an imidazole, a methyl thiolate, and an acetate. The substrate was approximated by a biapenem analog in which the bicycle-triazoliumthio group was replaced by -CH3. In addition, the model also includes an H2O and a methyl imidazole representing His-118. The Becke-3-Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP) exchange correlation functional and a standard basis set (6-31G**) were used. The geometries of stationary points were fully optimized with no geometric constraints, and the default convergence criterion was used. This is followed by the calculations of their harmonic vibrational frequencies and electrostatic potential charges. Finally, solvent effects were approximately taken into account with the polarized continuum model. Model studies of the hydrolysis of a biapenem analog catalyzed by two general bases, namely acetate and imidazole, were also performed at the B3LYP/6-31++G** level of theory. All DFT calculations reported in this work were performed using Gaussian 03. 3www.gaussian.com. QM/MM Models—A major disadvantage of the truncated active site model is its omission of the electrostatic and van der Waals microenvironment supplied by its surrounding protein residues and solvent. An approximate solution is to include the entire solvated protein but to partition the enzyme into a quantum mechanical region surrounded by a classical molecular mechanical region. This QM/MM approach (20Warshel A. Levitt M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 103: 227-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3695) Google Scholar) has been quite successful in studying enzymatic reactions (21Gao J. Truhlar D.G. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 2002; 53: 467-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 22Warshel A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 425-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The advantages are particularly conspicuous for metalloenzymes, because the metal-ligand bonds are notoriously difficult to model with force fields. Following our earlier work (18Xu D. Zhou Y. Xie D. Guo H. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 6679-6689Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), a QM/MM method is used to study the catalytic mechanism of the CphA enzyme. The model construction has been discussed in detail in our recent publication on the binding dynamics of CphA complexed with biapenem (18Xu D. Zhou Y. Xie D. Guo H. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 6679-6689Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here, only a short description is given. Starting from the recent x-ray structure of the enzyme-intermediate complex (PDB code 1X8I) (17Garau G. Bebrone C. Anne C. Galleni M. Frere J.-M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), the hydrolysis intermediate was removed, and hydrogens were added. The biapenem molecule was then manually docked at the enzyme active site in a manner consistent with the x-ray structures. After solvated in a pre-equilibrated sphere of TIP3P waters with a 25 Å radius, the enzyme-substrate complex was subjected to stochastic boundary conditions (23Brooks C.L. II I Karplus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 159-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) designed to reduce computational costs by removing those atoms 25 Å away from the zinc ion and restricting the motion of atoms in the buffer zone (22 < r < 25 Å) using a Langevin model. Non-bonded interactions were cut off at 12 Å. The MM region in our simulations was characterized by the CHARMM all atom force field (24MacKerell Jr., A.D. Bashford D. Bellott M. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Evanseck J.D. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J. Guo H. Ha S. Joseph-McCarthy D. Kuchnir L. Kuczera K. Lau F.T.K. Mattos C. Michnick S. Ngo T. Nguyen D.T. Prodhom B. Reiher III, W.E. Roux B. Schlenkrich M.

The QM region contains Zn2+, its protein ligands Asp-120, Cys-221, and His-263, one crystal water (W11), and a potential general base His-118, as well as the biapenem substrate. The CHARMM van der Waals parameters were used for the 82 QM atoms. The interface between the QM and MM regions was approximated using link atoms (25Field M.J. Bash P.A. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1990; 11: 700-733Crossref Scopus (2185) Google Scholar), which were added to Cβ atoms of the four residues. All calculations reported here were carried out using CHARMM (26Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar). In most of the calculations reported here, the QM part of the enzyme-substrate complex was treated with the self-consistent charge density functional tight binding (SCC-DFTB) method (27Elstner M. Porezag D. Jungnickel G. Elsner J. Haugk M. Frauenheim T. Suhai S. Seigert G. Phys. Rev. 1998; B58: 7260-7268Crossref Scopus (3322) Google Scholar) implemented in CHARMM (28Cui Q. Elstner M. Kaxiras E. Frauenheim T. Karplus M. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2001; 105: 569-585Crossref Scopus (561) Google Scholar). SCC-DFTB is an approximate but very efficient density functional theory. It has been extensively tested (28Cui Q. Elstner M. Kaxiras E. Frauenheim T. Karplus M. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2001; 105: 569-585Crossref Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 29Elstner M. Hobza P. Frauenheim T. Suhai S. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2001; 114: 5149-5155Crossref Scopus (951) Google Scholar) and applied successfully to several enzyme systems (30Riccardi, D., Schaefer, P., Yang, Y., Yu, H., Ghosh, N., Prat-Resina, X., Konig, P., Li, G., Xu, D., Guo, H., Elstener, M., and Cui, Q. (in press) J. Phys. Chem. BGoogle Scholar). A particularly important advance related to this work is the recent parameterization of biological zinc, which yielded results, such as geometry and ligand binding energies, which are in much better agreement with the B3LYP/6-311+G** model than other semiempirical methods (31Elstner M. Cui Q. Munih P. Kaxiras E. Frauenheim T. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 2003; 24: 565-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To ensure the accuracy of SCC-DFTB/MM results, we have also performed single point B3LYP/CHARMM calculations along the semiempirical reaction path. The large size of the QM region forced us to employ a smaller basis set (6-31G) than that used in the truncated active site model. The reaction coordinate for the nucleophilic addition was defined as Rϕ = ROw-C7 (see Scheme 1 for atom definitions). This selection of the reaction coordinate does not specifically assign the general base, which can be either His-118 or Asp-120, as suggested by our previous simulations of the binding dynamics (18Xu D. Zhou Y. Xie D. Guo H. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 6679-6689Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, this choice may also shed light on the nature of the reaction path. In particular, movement along the reaction coordinate would not lead to the enzyme-intermediate (EI) complex if a tetrahedral intermediate were to exist. The reaction path energy profile was determined by adiabatic mapping. The configurations obtained from the reaction path calculations were later used as the initial structures for the free energy simulation. In the potential of mean force (PMF) calculations, umbrella sampling (32Torrie G.M. Valleau J.P. J. Comput. Phys. 1977; 23: 187-199Crossref Scopus (4333) Google Scholar) with harmonic force constants in the 100∼180 kcal/mol·Å2 range was employed in twelve windows. The configuration space was sampled by classical molecular dynamics (MD). In each window, the minimal energy configuration was heated to 300 K in 30 ps followed by 30 ps of equilibration at the same temperature. The data were collected in the subsequent 40 ps. Finally, the PMF was obtained using the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) (33Kumar S. Bouzida D. Swendsen R.H. Kollman P.A. Rosenberg J.M. J. Comput. Chem. 1992; 13: 1011-1021Crossref Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). During the MD calculations, the SHAKE algorithm (34Ryckaert J.P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J. J. Comput. Phys. 1977; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (17193) Google Scholar) was applied to maintain all covalent bonds involved hydrogen atoms, except for those in the catalytic water. The time step was 1 fs. DFT Model—As shown in our earlier work (18Xu D. Zhou Y. Xie D. Guo H. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 6679-6689Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the zinc binding site can be accurately described by a truncated active site model using DFT. Here, we have used a similar model to describe the nucleophilic substitution step of the hydrolysis reaction, with a larger basis set. The optimized ES complex in Fig. 1 was found to have a very similar geometry to that reported in Ref. 18Xu D. Zhou Y. Xie D. Guo H. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 6679-6689Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar. Some key geometric parameters are summarized in Table 1 along with average distances and angles obtained from our previous MD simulation of the enzyme-substrate complex. In particular, the zinc ion is tetracoordinated by four ligands, namely His-263, Cys-221, Asp-120, and the substrate carboxylate. A water molecule is located in a pocket formed by His-118, Asp-120, and the β-lactam ring, well positioned for the nucleophilic attack at the substrate carbonyl carbon (C7). The Ow···C7 distance is 3.38 Å, close to that observed in our earlier MD simulation (3.54 ± 0.58 Å). The water molecule forms hydrogen bonds with both Nδ1 of the His-118 imidazole ring and the metal-binding Oδ2 atom of Asp-120. The latter appears to be stronger than the former, as evidenced by the hydrogen bond distances of 2.43 (H···Nδ1) and 1.93 Å (H···Oδ2), respectively.TABLE 1Key geometric parameters of stationary points obtained at the B3LYP/6-31G** level of theory using the truncated active-site model and comparisons with QM/MM results The QM/MM data for the ES complex were taken from our earlier MD study (18Xu D.

Chem. 2005; 48: 6679-6689Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)b Saddle point geometry obtained by conjugate peaks refinement of the reaction path Open table in a new tab The existence of two basic side chains that are hydrogen-bonded with the nucleophilic water observed in both the DFT and QM/MM models raises an interesting question about the identity of the general base in the nucleophilic substitution step of the hydrolysis reaction. The mechanism proposed by Garau et al. (17Garau G. Bebrone C. Anne C. Galleni M. Frere J.-M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) favors His-118, but the strong hydrogen bond with Asp-120 suggests an alternative with the carboxylate side chain group as the general base. To resolve this issue, we studied both scenarios within the truncated active site model by searching for reactive transition states. As displayed in Fig. 1, a transition state was located for the nucleophilic substitution step of the hydrolysis reaction with Asp-120 as the general base, and its optimized bond lengths and angles are also listed in Table 1. This first-order saddle point, as evidenced by a single imaginary frequency, features nearly concerted nucleophilic addition and elimination steps, as evidenced by a shortened Ow-C7 bond (1.68 versus 3.38 Å in the ES complex) and an elongated C7-N4 bond (1.86 versus 1.41 Å in the ES complex). The partial cleavage of the amide bond creates an anionic N4, evidenced by its negative charge (-0.45) at the transition state, in sharp contrast with its charge (0.06) in the reactant complex. As the water nucleophile approaches C7, one of its hydrogen atoms (H1) starts to move toward Oδ2 of Asp-120. The Ow···H1 and H1···Oδ2 distances at the transition state are 1.05 and 1.50 Å, respectively. As a result, the metal-ligand bond between the Asp-120 carboxylate group and zinc ion becomes slightly impaired as the distance Oδ2···Zn increases from 1.97 to 2.08 Å. In the meantime, the negative charge buildup at N4 due to the C-N bond cleavage provides incentives for it to move toward the zinc ion. The corresponding N4···Zn distance at the transition state becomes 2.21 from 3.44 Å in the ES complex. The zinc ion is pentacoordinated in the transition state. No tetrahedral intermediate was found in this reaction pathway, and the intrinsic reaction coordinate leads directly to the ES complex in one direction and the EI complex in the other. The EI complex is displayed in Fig. 1, and selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 1 along with those for other stationary points. The procession from the transition state to the EI complex results in the complete cleavage of the lactam amide bond, accompanied by a concomitant proton transfer to the metal-binding Asp-120. The neutralization of the Asp-120 side chain renders it an ineffective ligand to the zinc ion, leading to a final Oδ2···Zn distance of 4.10 Å, signifying the breaking of the bond. In the meantime, the negatively charged N4 (q = -0.70) replaces Asp-120 as the fourth ligand to the zinc ion, as evidenced by the short (1.95 Å) N4···Zn distance. The resulting EI complex can be converted to the enzyme product complex by proton transfer and possibly intramolecular rearrangements, as suggested by the recent x-ray structure (17Garau G. Bebrone C. Anne C. Galleni M. Frere J.-M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, the latter processes were not studied here. The energies, zero-point corrected energies, and free energies of all of the stationary points are summarized in Table 2. The reaction barrier and exothermicity are 31.7 and 1.1 kcal/mol, respectively, at the B3LYP/6-31G** level. The basis set effect seems to be small as the corresponding values at the B3LYP/6-31G* are 32.0 and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. The activation free energy is estimated to be 35.0 kcal/mol. The relatively large reaction barrier is likely because of the lack of the protein/solvent environment in the truncated model. After the solvent effects are included using the polarized continuum model, for example, the barrier is reduced by ∼6 kcal/mol.TABLE 2Energetics (kcal/mol) for the nucleophilic substitution step of the hydrolysis reaction The truncated active site model at the B3LYP/6-31G** level of theory was used.EnergeticsaAll energies are given relative to ESTSEIEnergy31.71.1Energy with ZPE correction31.22.2Free energy35.02.4Free energy (PCM)bAqueous solution (ϵ = 80)29.10.6a All energies are given relative to ESb Aqueous solution (ϵ = 80) Open table in a new tab However, repeated efforts to locate the transition state with His-118 as the general base failed. To understand the capacity of the His or Asp residue as a general base in catalyzing the hydrolysis of β-lactams, we examined simple model systems without the metal ion and its protein ligands in which the two amino acid side chains are approximated by an imidazole ring and acetate, respectively. Five stationary states were located for the acetate-catalyzed reaction, including the reactant complex, transition state for nucleophilic addition (TS1), tetrahedral intermediate, transition state for elimination (TS2), and product complex. They are displayed in Fig. 2 with key bond lengths indicated in the figure. The rate-limiting step is the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate, whereas the barrier for elimination is very small. These results are consistent with previous theoretical studies of β-lactam hydrolysis (35Coll M. Frau J. Vilanova B. Donoso J. Munoz F. Blanco F.G. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 11389-11394Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 36Diaz N. Suarez A. Sordo J.A. Tunon I. Silla E. Chem. Eur. J. 2002; 8: 859Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). When the imidazole group was used as the general base, on the other hand, no reactive transition state was located after an exhaustive search. Reaction path calculations showed a monotonically increased energy profile in the nucleophilic addition coordinate. These results indicate that Asp is a better catalyst than His in the gas phase. This issue will be further addressed below with a QM/MM model in which the protein/solvent environment is included in the simulations. QM/MM Models—Although the truncated active site model provides insightful information about the catalytic reaction, it includes neither the protein/solvent environment nor the corresponding dynamics. To bridge the gap, we investigated the same nucleophilic substitution step of the β-lactam hydrolysis reaction employing two QM/MM models, namely the SCC-DFTB/CHARMM and B3LYP/CHARMM models. The minimal energy profile along the reaction coordinate was first determined by adiabatic mapping. The geometric parameters of the transition state, which was obtained by conjugate peak refinement (37Fischer S. Karplus M. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1992; 194: 252-261Crossref Scopus (426) Google Scholar), are listed in Table 1, and their agreement with the DFT transition state is quite reasonable, although im"

Confluent monolayers of Calu-3 cells, grown under an air-liquid interface, were mounted in Ussing chambers for the measurements of chloride short circuit current (Isc) and trans-epithelial resistance (Rt). Addition of GSNO into the apical compartment of these chambers resulted in significant and sustained increase of Isc with an IC50 of 3.2 ± 1 μm (mean ± 1 S.E.; n = 6). Addition of either glibenclamide or pre-treatment of Calu-3 cells with the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1H-(1,2,4)-oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one totally prevented the GSNO-induced increase of Isc. Conversely, BAY 41-2272, a sGC stimulator, increased Isc in a dose-response fashion. The GSNO increase of Isc was reversed by addition of two phosphatases (PP2A1, PP2A2) into the apical compartment of Ussing chambers containing Calu-3 monolayers. Oxy-myoglobin (oxy-Mb, 300 μm) added into the apical compartment of Ussing chambers either prior or after GSNO either completely prevented or immediately reversed the increase of Isc. However, smaller concentrations of oxy-Mb (1–10 μm), sufficient to scavenge NO in the medium (as assessed by direct measurement of NO in the Ussing chamber using an ISO-NO meter) decreased Isc partially. Oxy-Mb did not reverse the increase of Isc following addition of GSNO and cysteine (50 μm). These findings indicate that GSNO stimulates Cl secretion via both cGMP-dependent and cGMP-independent mechanisms.

In most epithelial cells, phosphorylation of the CFTR regulatory domain by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A increases its activity as a Cl– channel (5Schwiebert E.M. Benos D.J. Egan M.E. Stutts M.J. Guggino W.B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S145-S166Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Although earlier studies localized CFTR mainly in airway cells, more recent studies provide convincing evidence for the presence of both immunoreactive and functional CFTR at the apical membranes of both fetal and adult ATII cells (6Lazrak A. Thome U. Myles C. Ware J. Chen L. Venglarik C.J. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L650-L658Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar).There is considerable evidence that reactive oxygen nitrogen species, generated by environmental pollutants and activated inflammatory or airway cells, may alter the properties of a number of ion channels either by direct modification (such as nitrosation, nitration, and oxidation) or via signal transduction pathways (7Matalon S. Hardiman K.M. Jain L. Eaton D.C. Kotlikoff M. Eu J.P. Sun J. Meissner G. Stamler J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L1184-L1189PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous studies indicate that prolonged exposure of confluent monolayers of Calu-3, 16 human bronchial epithelial, or mouse tracheal epithelial cells to physiological levels of NO, generated by the chemical donor DETA NONOate, decrease levels of CFTR in their apical membranes and impaired chloride (Cl–) secretion in response to cAMP, a well established regulator of CFTR (8Jilling T.

Matalon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43041-43049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These changes were found to be due to post-translational modification of CFTR by reactive oxygen nitrogen intermediates. Decreased levels and function of normal CFTR may account for some of the cystic fibrosis-like symptoms that occur in chronic inflammatory lung diseases associated with increased NO production.In several systems, the biological effects of NO on transport proteins have been associated with the formation of nitrosothiols (7Matalon S. Hardiman K.M. Jain L. Eaton D.C. Kotlikoff M. Eu J.P. Sun J. Meissner G. Stamler J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L1184-L1189PubMed Google Scholar). Micromolar concentrations of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) have been detected in the airway fluid of normal subjects, and substantially higher levels were observed in the lungs of patients with pneumonia or during inhalation of 80 ppm of NO (10Gaston B. Reilly J. Drazen J.M. Fackler J. Ramdev P. Arnelle D. Mullins M.E. Sugarbaker D.J. Chee C. Singel D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10957-10961Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Conversely, lower concentrations of GSNO were found in the lower airways of patients with cystic fibrosis (11Grasemann H. Gaston B. Fang K. Paul K. Ratjen F. J. Pediatr. 1999; 135: 770-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and asthma (12Gaston B. Sears S. Woods J. Hunt J. Ponaman M. McMahon T. Stamler J.S. Lancet. 1998; 351: 1317-1319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). GSNO may directly trans-nitrosate proteins, or release NO via reduction or homolysis. Oxidized glutathione may oxidize or glutathionylate a number of proteins, events known to alter protein function. NO, generated from GSNO, can stimulate cGMP or react with superoxide to form peroxynitrite (ONOO–), providing an alternate pathway for directly modulating ion channel function (13Matalon S. O'Brodovich H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 627-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). More recently, amino acid transporters have been identified as potential mediators of S-nitrosothiol transport without the intermediate formation of NO, revealing a novel mechanism through which S-nitrosothiol metabolism is controlled (14Zhang Y. Hogg N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar).Currently, the effects of GSNO on CFTR function are in dispute: Zaman et al. (15Zaman K. McPherson M. Vaughan J. Hunt J. Mendes F. Gaston B. Palmer L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) reported that GSNO increases maturation and function of both wild-type and ΔF508 CFTR via post-transcriptional regulation, most likely via S-nitrosation. However, Wang et al. (16Wang W. Oliva C. Li G. Holmgren A. Lillig C.H. Kirk K.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) reported that oxidized forms of glutathione (including GSNO) decreased CFTR function by oxidative modifications (glutathionylation). However, none of these studies utilized confluent monolayers of airway cells and thus were unable to ascertain the effects of GSNO on vectorial Cl– transport.Herein we exposed Calu-3 cells, an extensively used model of human airway gland serous cells, grown under an air liquid interface, to physiological concentrations of GSNO for up to 6 h and measured Cl– short circuit currents (Isc) and trans-epithelial resistance (Rt). We have chosen to use Calu-3 cells, because they do not contain epithelial sodium channels, which are also affected by NO adducts (17Guo Y. Duvall M.D. Crow J.P. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L369-L377PubMed Google Scholar, 18Duvall M.D. Zhu S. Fuller C.M. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1417-C1423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chen L. Fuller C.M. Kleyman T.R. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F1202-F1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), complicating the interpretation of the results. Our results indicate that addition of GSNO into the apical compartment of Ussing chambers, containing either intact or basolaterally permeabilized monolayers of Calu-3, resulted in sustained increases of Isc without significant changes of Rt. These increases were partly due to (i) stimulation of soluble guanylyl cyclase and possible phosphorylation of CFTR via cGMP-dependent mechanisms and (ii) nitrosation of CFTR or other chaperon proteins by reactive intermediates of GSNO and cysteine (S-nitrocysteine), entering the cytoplasm via amino acid transport system L, where they are capable of nitrosating proteins without the intermediate formation of NO (20Zhang Y. Hogg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7891-7896Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Human airway mucosal gland cells Calu-3 cells (HTB-55, ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown using minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and maintained in T-75 tissue culture flasks (Costar, Cambridge, MA) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Confluent cell layers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline two times and then incubated with 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA in saline for 30 min to lift them from the flasks. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (125 × g for 10 min), resuspended in the culture medium, and seeded at a density of 106 cells/cm2 onto Type 3470 Costar Transwell inserts (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, 0.45-μm pore size, 0.33-cm2 surface area, 0.4 μm), for mounting in Ussing chambers. The culture media on the basolateral side of the filters was replaced every 48 h. After 3 days, the apical fluid was removed, and when monolayers were able to exclude fluid for the apical surface they were cultured for an additional 3–4 days using an air (apical) and fluid (basolateral) interface (21Thome U. Lazrak A. Chen L. Kirk M.C. Thomas M.J. Forman H.J. Matalon S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 662-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). They were then used for bioelectric studies as described below.NO Donors and Inhibitors—GSNO (Alexis, San Diego, CA) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Acros, Fairlawn, NJ). GSNO concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance of the stock solution at 333 nm (ϵ336 nm = 900 mm–1 × cm–1) with a Beckman DU 7400 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Oxy-myoglobin (oxy-Mb) was prepared as previously described (22Cornwell T.L. Ceaser E.K. Li J. Marrs K.L. rley-Usmar V.M. Patel R.P. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C1516-C1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, myoglobin from horse heart (Sigma) was dissolved in phosphate-buffer saline containing 10 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. Met-myoglobin was reduced to oxy-Mb by addition of sodium hydrosulfite and subsequently purified by gel-filtration chromatography using an NAPT 10 column (Amersham Biosciences). Oxy-Mb concentrations were determined by a Beckman DU 7400 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter) using the extinction coefficient per heme group ϵ582 nm = 14.4 mm–1 × cm–1. Diethylamine NONOate (DEA/NO) (t½ = 2 min at 37 °C) was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI) and prepared fresh each day according to manufacturer's instructions.Measurements of Nitrosothiols and NO Release—GSNO (10 μm) was added into the apical compartment of Ussing chambers housing confluent monolayer of Calu-3 cells (see below). In a number of cases, NO concentration into the medium was monitored continuously using an NO-specific electrode (ISO-NO, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). S-Nitrosothiol concentrations in the medium following addition of GSNO were measured by I3-reductive chemiluminescence as previously described (23Crawford J.H. Isbell T.S. Huang Z. Shiva S. Chacko B.K. Schechter A.N. Darley-Usmar V.M. Kerby J.D. Lang Jr., J.D. Kraus D. Ho C. Gladwin M.T. Patel R.P. Blood. 2006; 107: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar).Measurements of Short-circuit Current (Isc) and Electrical Resistance (Rt)—Monolayers of Calu-3 cells were mounted in Ussing chambers (Jim's Instruments, Iowa City, IA) and bathed on both sides with solutions containing: (mm) 120 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 3.3 KH2PO4, 0.83 K2HPO4, 1.2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES (Na+-free), 10 mannitol (apical compartment), and 10 glucose (basolateral compartment). Osmolarity of all solutions, as measured by a freezing depression osmometer (Wescor Inc., Logan, UT) was between 290 and 300 mosm. Bath solutions were stirred vigorously by bubbling continuously with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C (pH 7.4). Monolayers were short-circuited to 0 mV and short-circuit currents (Isc) were measured with an epithelial voltage clamp (VCC-600, Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, CA). A 10-mV pulse of 1-s duration was imposed every 10 s to monitor Rt, which was calculated using Ohm's law. Data were collected using the Acquire and Analyze program, version 1.45 (Physiologic Instruments).To ascertain the contribution of Cl– and HCO–3 ions to the baseline and GSNO, induced Isc, NaCl, or NaHCO3 were replaced with equimolar amounts of Na+-gluconate or Na-HEPES, respectively. In a third set of ion substitution experiments, both Cl– and HCO–3 were replaced with Na+-gluconate and Na+-HEPES. In experiments conducted in the absence of HCO–3 solutions were bubbled with 100% O2 instead of 95% O2 and 5% CO2.Once Isc reached steady-state values (usually within 10–20 min from mounting), GSNO (0.1–200 μm) was added into the apical compartment and Isc and Rt were recorded till they reached new steady-state values. At that time, the CFTR blockers glibenclamide (0.1–0.4 mm, Sigma) or CFTR inh-172 (20 μm, Calbiochem), oxy-Mb (0.1–400 μm), or two protein phosphatases PP2A1 and PP2A2 (2 milliunits/ml, Calbiochem) were added into the apical compartments and changes in Isc and Rt were recorded. In some experiments, Calu-3 cell monolayers were pre-treated with ODQ (5 μm, Tocris Cookson, St. Louis, MO), a specific inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, every 12 h for 72 h prior to being mounted in the Ussing chambers.To evaluate effects of GSNO on apical membrane Cl– conductance, Calu-3 monolayers were mounted in Ussing chambers under short-circuit conditions in the presence of a basolateral to apical (125:5 mm) Cl– gradient, and the pore-forming antibiotic amphotericin (10 μm) was added into the basolateral compartment. Under these conditions, the basolateral membrane is eliminated as a barrier to the flow of monovalent ions, and Isc provides a direct measure of the apical membrane Cl– conductance. GSNO (10 μm) was then added into the apical compartment followed by glibenclamide or CFTR inh-172.Measurements of cAMP and cGMP—Filters containing Calu-3 cells were mounted in Ussing chambers; GSNO (10 μm), along with cysteine (50 μm) or an equivalent amount of vehicle, were added into the apical compartment for either 3 or 30 min. At the end of these times, filters were incubated with 0.1 m HCl plus 1% Triton X-100, and cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 600 × g and kept at –80 °C. cAMP or cGMP levels were measured using the Direct cAMP or cGMP enzyme-immunoassay kits (Assay Designs Inc., Ann Arbor, MI), according to the manufacturer's specifications.Statistical Analysis—All data were expressed as means ± 1 S.E.; statistical significance among multiple means was assessed by analysis of variance, followed by the Bonferroni modification of the t test, adjusted for multiple comparisons; p values of < 0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSGeneration of NO—Addition of 10 μm GSNO into the apical compartment of an Ussing chamber containing empty filters resulted in the immediate formation of NO up to ∼1 μm, which then declined to a steady-state value of ∼0.3 μm, lasting over 45 min. Addition of 10 μm oxy-Mb into the apical compartment decreased the concentration of NO to non-detectable levels. Smaller concentrations oxy-Mb (0.1–1 μm) also decreased NO levels but in a transient fashion (Fig. 1). In contrast, when 10 μm GSNO was added into Ussing chambers containing confluent monolayers of Calu-3 cells, the NO concentration increased only up to ∼0.3 μm and rapidly declined to baseline values (Fig. 1). Similar levels of nitrosothiols were observed in the presence and absence of Calu-3 cells (Fig. 1). These data indicate that, under our experimental conditions, GSNO decomposed to produce free NO, which was then consumed by Calu-3 cells.GSNO Increases Cl– Secretion across Calu-3 Cells—Addition of 10 μm GSNO into the apical compartment containing Calu-3 cells resulted in an immediate transient increase of Isc, followed by a sustained plateau (Fig. 2). Mean values (± S.E.) are shown in Table 1. The sustained increase of Cl– secretion was reversed by the apical addition of the CFTR inhibitors glibenclamide (0.3 mm, Fig. 2) or CFTRinh-172 (20 μm, Fig. 2) or the basolateral addition of ouabain (1 mm, Table 1). Trans-epithelial resistance decreased somewhat, but stabilized to >600 Ω × cm2 (Fig. 2). Addition of glibenclamide into the apical compartment prior to GSNO decreased Isc and prevented the sustained increase of Isc in response to GSNO (see Table 1). The IC50 for the GSNO induced increase of Isc was 3.6 ± 1.3 μm (n = 6) (Fig. 2). Corresponding amounts of vehicle, nitrite, GSSG, or GSH had no effect on Isc or Rt (data not shown).FIGURE 2GSNO increases Isc across Calu-3 cells. Confluent monolayers of Calu-3 cells were mounted in an Ussing chamber. Upper panel, GSNO (10 μm) was added into the apical compartment. Isc (left axis) and Rt (right axis) were measured as described in the text. Once Isc stabilized, three boluses of glibenclamide (0.1 mm each) were added into the apical compartment. Results are shown of typical experiments. See Table 1 for mean values. Middle panel, CFTRinh-172 inhibits the GSNO-induced Isc in Calu-3 cells. Following addition of GSNO (10 μm) into the apical compartment, addition of the specific CFTR inhibitor CFTRinh-172 inhibited Isc in a dose-response fashion. Results are shown for a typical experiment. For mean values see Table 1. Lower panel, dose-dependent increase of Isc by GSNO. GSNO (0.05–200 μm) were added sequentially into the apical compartments of Ussing chambers containing Calu-3 cells. The percentage of maximum GSNO-induced current (y-axis) was calculated as follows: % = [(Ix – I0)/(I200 – I0)] x 100, where I0 is the current obtained without GSNO, Ix is the steady-state current with a given concentration of GSNO (in μm), and I200 is the current measured during with 200 μm GSNO. ki was calculated by fitting the data with the equation, Y = I200*(kihc)/[kihc + Ix], where hc is the Hill coefficient using Microcal Origin Version 6.

Open table in a new tab Because Calu-3 cells transport both Cl– and HCO–3, we investigated the contribution of both ions to the transient and steady response of the Isc to GSNO. As seen in Fig. 3, the majority of the peak increase was due to movement of HCO–3, whereas both Cl– and HCO–3 contributed equally to the steady-state increases.FIGURE 3Effects of GSNO on Isc of Calu-3 cells bathed with Cl– and HCO –3 free solutions. Confluent monolayers of Calu-3 cells were mounted in Ussing chambers containing normal Ringer's solution (NR), Cl– free ((–) Cl–), HCO –3 free ((–) HCO –3), and both Cl– and HCO –3 ((–) Cl–/HCO –3) free solutions (see “Materials and Methods”). GSNO (10 μm) was added into the apical compartments of the Ussing chambers, and peak and steady-state responses were recorded. Glibenclamide (Glib., 0.3 mm) was added into the apical compartments once steady-state values of Isc were achieved. Values are means ± 1 S.E. The number of monolayers for each group was as follows: NR = 4; (–) Cl– = 5; (–) HCO –3 = 3; and (–) Cl–/HCO –3 = 4. *, p < 0.05 compared with their corresponding baseline values (by pared t-tests).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GSNO Increases Isc by Stimulating CFTR—Because Cl– secretion across Calu-3 cells involves the coordinated entry of Cl– into the cytoplasm via basolateral transporters and their subsequent secretion across the apical membrane through CFTR pathways, we investigated the effects of GSNO across basolaterally permeabilized monolayers in the presence of secretory Cl– gradients. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2, GSNO increased Isc in a manner similar to what was observed in intact monolayers. Addition of glibenclamide (Fig. 4), oxy-Mb (Fig. 4) or CFTRinh-172 (Table 2) into the apical compartments returned Isc to its pre-GSNO levels.FIGURE 4GSNO increases Isc across basolaterally permeabilized monolayers. Calu-3 monolayers were mounted in Ussing chambers containing 125 and 5 mm Cl– in their basolateral and apical compartments, respectively. The basolateral membrane was then permeabilized by the addition of the pore forming antibiotic amphotericin (10 μm). Addition of ouabain (1 mm) into the basolateral compartment resulted in a small increase of Isc indicating a non-functional basolateral membrane. Subsequent addition of GSNO (10 μm) into the apical compartment resulted in transient and steady-state increases of Isc, which was inhibited by glibenclamide (0.3 mm; upper panel) or oxy-Mb (0.3 mm; lower panel). Results of typical experiments are shown, which were repeated at least three times.

Open table in a new tab Role of NO in GSNO-dependent Stimulation of CFTR—As shown in Fig. 5, addition of oxy-Mb (1 μm) into an apical chamber decreased the GSNO induced Isc by <20%. At higher concentrations (300 μm), oxy-Mb either completely prevented or immediately decreased the GSNO increase of Isc (Fig. 5 and Table 3). This was not due to nonspecific inhibition of CFTR, because the subsequent addition of 10 μm forskolin readily increased Isc to the same extent as in control cells (Fig. 6). These data indicate that NO must be present to stimulate Cl– secretion. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 6 addition of diethylamine NONOate, a NO donor with a t½ of <3 min, caused only a transient increase of Isc.FIGURE 5Oxy-Mb both prevents and reverses the effects of GSNO on Isc of Calu-3 cells. Confluent monolayers of Calu-3 cells were mounted in Ussing chambers. Upper panel, following addition of GSNO (10 μm) into the apical chamber oxy-Mb (0.1, 1, 10, or 300 μm) was added apically. Results of a typical experiment are shown (middle panel). Changes in Isc following addition of oxy-Mb concentrations are also shown. Values were computed by subtracting the peak decrease in Isc following addition of oxy-Mb from the plateau value of Isc following addition of 10 μm GSNO into the apical compartment. Values are means ± 1 S.E.; n = 7; *, p < 0.05 compared with the corresponding value in the absence of oxy-Mb (analysis of variance and modified t test).

https://openalex.org/W1970666030,"NORE1A is a growth and tumor suppressor that is inactivated in a variety of cancers. NORE1A has been shown to bind to the active Ras oncogene product. However, the mechanism of NORE1A-induced growth arrest and tumor suppression remains unknown. Using anchorage-independent growth assays, we mapped the NORE1A effector domain (the minimal region of the protein responsible for its growth-suppressive effects) to the fragment containing the central and Ras association domains of NORE1A (amino acids 191-363). Expression of the NORE1A effector domain in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells resulted in the selective inhibition of signal transduction through the ERK pathway. The full-length NORE1A (416 amino acids) and its fragments capable of growth suppression were localized to centrosomes and microtubules in normal and transformed human cells in a Ras-independent manner. A mutant that was deficient in binding to centrosomes and microtubules was also deficient in inducing cell cycle arrest. This suggests that cytoskeletal localization is required for growth-suppressive effects of NORE1A. Ras binding function was required for growth-suppressive effects of the full-length NORE1A but not for the growth-suppressive effects of the effector domain. Our studies suggest that association of NORE1A with cytoskeletal elements is essential for NORE1A-induced growth suppression and that the ERK pathway is a target for NORE1A growth-suppressive activities.

Ras is the most common dominant oncogene found in human tumors, especially in those of epithelial origin (1Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar). Ras family consists of three ubiquitously expressed 21-kDa proteins (H-, Ki- and N-Ras) localized at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, and each is capable of guanine nucleotide binding. If GDP is bound to Ras, the protein is inactive; exchange of GDP for GTP activates Ras (2Egan S.E. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 781-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 3Shields J.M.

Ras effectors, proteins which bind to Ras-GTP with a much higher affinity than to Ras-GDP, are thought to be responsible for transmitting Ras signals downstream (4Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Nore1 (novel Ras effector 1) was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a putative Ras effector. Bacterially expressed Nore1 directly interacts with Ras in vitro in a GTP-dependent manner; in KB cells, endogenous NORE1 associates with endogenous Ras upon serum stimulation (5Vavvas D. Li X. Avruch J. Zhang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5439-5442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The full-length NORE1 cDNA encodes a 47-kDa basic protein, which contains a proline-rich region at its N terminus followed by a putative diacylglycerol/phorbol ester-binding domain (Fig. 1A). The Ras binding domain is located near the C terminus. The human NORE1 gene encodes several isoforms, of which NORE1A and NORE1B are the most prominent (6Tommasi S. Dammann R. Jin S.G. Zhang X.F.

Data obtained by several laboratories strongly suggest that the longest splice isoform of the NORE1 gene, NORE1A, is a growth and tumor suppressor. Most normal tissues, including lung, express NORE1A; however, its expression is lost in several cancer cell lines, including lung carcinoma A549 (6Tommasi S. Dammann R. Jin S.G. Zhang X.F. Avruch J. Pfeifer G.P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2713-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Hesson et al. (19Hesson L. Dallol A. Minna J.D. Maher E.R. Latif F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) showed by methylation-specific PCR that the NORE1A promoter region CpG islands are hypermethylated in 18% of NSCLC, 10% of SCLC, 40% of breast, 17% of colorectal, and 33% of kidney tumor cell lines. In the same study, 24% of primary NSCLC DNA specimens displayed NORE1A promoter methylation, whereas methylation was not detected in NORE1A from the corresponding normal lung tissue DNA. Another group demonstrated that NORE1A promoter hypermethylation is confined to lung tumors with a wild type Ki-Ras, suggesting that both Ki-Ras and NORE1A may act in the same pathway (20Irimia M. Fraga M.F. Sanchez-Cespedes M. Esteller M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8695-8699Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Vos et al. (21Vos M.D. Martinez A. Ellis C.A. Vallecorsa T. Clark G.J. J. Biol.

NORE1A was identified as a breakpoint-spanning gene in a familial renal clear cell carcinoma chromosomal translocation. NORE1A expression was down-regulated in all RCC cell lines tested; the NORE1A promoter was methylated in 32% of sporadic RCC tumors.

(23Aoyama Y. Avruch J. Zhang X.F. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3426-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) showed, by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, that expression of NORE1A in NSCLC and melanoma cell lines is very low in comparison with nontransformed matching controls. Re-expression of NORE1A in NSCLC cell line A549 causes a decrease in the number of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle and a reciprocal increase of the fraction of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (23Aoyama Y. Avruch J. Zhang X.F. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3426-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, despite the loss of NORE1A expression in many human cancers, molecular mechanism(s) of the growth and tumor suppression by NORE1A are not known. Specifically, the importance of binding to Ras and related GTPases for the growth-suppressive activity of NORE1A is unclear. The yeast two-hybrid data showed that NORE1A is capable of binding Ras and related GTPases directly (24Ortiz-Vega S. Khokhlatchev A. Nedwidek M. Zhang X.F. Dammann R. Pfeifer G.P. Avruch J.

However, Aoyama et al. (23Aoyama Y. Avruch J. Zhang X.F. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3426-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) found that the antiproliferative activity of NORE1A is independent of the presence of an activated Ras oncogene or the ability of NORE1A to bind Ras. The effect of NORE1A expression on intracellular signal transduction is not known. The subcellular localization of the endogenous NORE1A protein has not been determined. In this paper, we characterize the NORE1A effector domain (i.e. the minimal region of the protein responsible for its growth-suppressive effects). We found that expression of this domain selectively suppresses ERK activity in A549 cells. We also found that endogenous NORE1A and its effector domain are targeted to the elements of microtubular cytoskeleton, and this ability is essential for the growth suppression properties of NORE1A.

The monoclonal antibody 10F10 (available from Upstate Biotechnology) was raised in our laboratory using human NORE1A 119-416 as the antigen. The antibody reacts with NORE1A epitope located within amino acids 119-191 of the human NORE1A protein. Rabbit antibodies against NORE1 were described previously (5Vavvas D. Li X. Avruch J.

Flow Cytometry and Anchorage-independent Assays—For flow cytometry, cells were plated in 6-well plates at 3 × 104/well and after 18-24 h were infected in triplicate with retroviruses. 72 h later, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, stained with 0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide, and analyzed by FACSvantage (BD Biosciences). Cell cycle distributions of GFP-positive cells were determined by ModFIT software. For the anchorage-independent growth assays, cells were infected with retroviruses encoding hrGFP or hrGFP fusion proteins and plated in 6-well plates in 0.35% agar at 3 × 104 (A549) and 5 × 104 (LNCaP) cells/plate 48 h after infection. Digital images were taken 15 (LNCaP) or 25-28 (A549) days after plating at × 10 magnification under UV illumination using the GFP filter set with a Retiga EXi camera connected to the LEICA DMIRE2 inverted microscope and captured using IPLab 3.6.5a software (Scanalytics, Rockville, MD). The number of green colonies expressing GFP alone or GFP-NORE1A fusions and their area in 20-30 randomly pictured viewfields for each experimental point were determined using IPLab 3.6.5a. Immunofluorescent Microscopy—Cells were grown in Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc, Rochester, NY) and, if required, infected with retroviruses 18-24 h after plating. 36-48 h later, cells were fixed in 100% methanol at -20 °C for 5 min, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with the indicated antibody diluted in 1 mg/ml BSA for 1.5-2 h at room temperature. After 3-4 washes in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20, cells were stained with a secondary antibody diluted in 1 mg/ml BSA for 45 min at room temperature. Slides were washed as described above and mounted using Vectashield medium containing DAPI. Digital images were taken at 100× magnification as described above using appropriate filter sets. For some experiments, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at 37 °C, extensively washed in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized, and blocked in 0.1% Triton X-100 containing 1 mg/ml BSA for 30 min at room temperature and stained with indicated antibodies described above. Both methods of fixation gave the same results. Tubulin-binding Assays—Purified bovine brain tubulin (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) was polymerized into microtubules in 80 mm PIPES, pH 7.1, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 20 μm taxol for 20 min at 35 °C. For in vitro cosedimentation assay, 10 μg of microtubules was mixed with 10 μl of A549 cell lysate, which expressed GFP-NORE1A, or 293 lysate, which expressed FLAG-NORE1A or its mutants, or FLAG-NORE1A protein that was expressed in 293 cells, purified on FLAG-agarose, and eluted with FLAG peptide. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, microtubules were pelleted by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 1 h at room temperature, and supernatant was collected and adjusted to 1× SDS gel loading buffer with its 4× stock. The pellet was dissolved in 1× SDS gel loading buffer and adjusted to the same volume as supernatant.

Expression of NORE1A Protein in Normal and Tumor Human Cells—We characterized expression of NORE1A in several normal and tumor human cell lines, using a monoclonal antibody raised in our laboratory. Fig. 1B shows that immortalized human HBEC3-KT cells display on a Western blot a single immunoreactive band or close doublet of the expected molecular mass, ∼46 kDa. In contrast, most tumor cell lines tested, including non-small cell lung cancer A549 (Fig. 1B), NCI-H23, H358, H157, renal carcinoma CaKi-1 (data not shown), and prostate carcinoma LNCaP (Fig. 1B), lack NORE1A expression. The Effect of NORE1A on Cell Cycle Distribution and Soft Agar Growth—For characterization of the biological properties of NORE1A, we fused the coding sequence of NORE1A with the C terminus of Renilla green fluorescent protein (hrGFP) to generate hrGFP-NORE1A. Retroviral vectors containing hrGFP-NORE1A or hrGFP alone were introduced in tumor cells, and cell cycle distribution of hrGFP-expressing cells was determined by flow cytometry. In A549 cells growing as a monolayer on plastic support, NORE1A re-expression usually induced a small increase, on average 5%, of cells in the G1 population (Table 1). In other cell lines, such as LNCaP, CaKi-1, H460, and H358, NORE1A expression did not induce any statistically significant changes in cell cycle distribution (Supplemental Fig. 1, B and C, and data not shown).TABLE 1Cell cycle distribution of A549 cells expressing GFP, NORE1A, and its truncation mutantsConstructG1SG2/MGFP alone54.8 ± 1.5 (4)32.9 ± 1.312.6 ± 0.6GFP-NORE1A60.1 ± 1.8 (4)ap = 0.012 versus GFP by Student's t test.27.9 ± 1.512 ± 0.4GFP-NORE1A 1-19157.1 ± 2.3 (4)31.3 ± 2.111.8 ± 1.1GFP-NORE1A 1-36357.6 ± 0.9 (2)30 ± 0.111.4 ± 0.9GFP-NORE1A 191-36375.5 ± 3.3 (3)bp = 0.01 versus GFP-NORE1A by Student's t test.15.8 ± 1.28.7 ± 2.5GFP-NORE1A 118-36367.2 ± 1.6 (3)cp = 0.037 versus GFP by Student's t test.23 ± 1.29.7 ± 1.3GFP-NORE1A 191-41660.9 ± 1.2 (3)18.1 ± 3.221 ± 4.4a p = 0.012 versus GFP by Student's t test.b p = 0.01 versus GFP-NORE1A by Student's t test.c p = 0.037 versus GFP by Student's t test. Open table in a new tab Importantly, in our hands, the re-expression of the closest relative to NORE1A, the RASSF1A protein, fused to hrGFP similarly to the way we re-expressed NORE1A, in the A549 cell line, resulted in a significant (2-3-fold over GFP) increase in the G2/M cell content with the concomitant decrease in G1 and S phases of the cell cycle and growth suppression (Supplemental Fig. 1A). Cells expressing NORE1A grew at the same rate as parental cells, whereas RASSF1A expression significantly suppressed cell growth. We did not observe any NORE1A-expressing cells with a DNA content less than G0/G1, suggesting that NORE1A does not induce apoptosis (data not shown). The anchorage-independent growth of tumor cells correlates best with the in vivo tumor-forming capabilities (30Cifone M.A. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1982; 1: 335-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We employed this assay to examine the effect of NORE1A on anchorage-independent growth of A549 and LNCaP cells. GFP fusion of NORE1A or hrGFP alone was introduced into cells by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Individual cells and cell colonies in soft agar that express recombinant proteins were identified by fluorescent microscopy with a GFP filter set. As shown in Table 2 and supplemental Fig. 1D, NORE1A efficiently suppressed the formation of large colonies in both A549 and LNCaP cell lines.TABLE 2The effect of wild type NORE1A and its mutants deficient in binding to Ras or MST kinases on soft agar colony formation of A549 and LNCaP cellsPercentage of colonies larger than 2000 μm2 in diameterA549LNCaPGFP alone57.3 ± 2.7 (19)63.3 ± 3.9 (14)Wild type NORE1A8.5 ± 2.3ap < 0.0001 versus GFP by Student's t test.

Open table in a new tab Characterization of NORE1A Domains Responsible for Growth Suppression—We used the anchorage-independent growth assay to determine the domains of the NORE1A molecule that are required for its growth-suppressive activity. For this purpose, a set of NORE1A truncations (Fig. 1A), fused in-frame with the C terminus of hrGFP, or hrGFP alone was introduced in A549 and LNCaP cells by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, and the colony-forming ability of cells expressing recombinant proteins was evaluated. Table 2 shows that deletion of the last 53 amino acids of NORE1A, representing the SARAH domain that binds MST kinases (25Khokhlatchev A. Rabizadeh S. Xavier R. Nedwidek M. Chen T. Zhang X.F. Seed B. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 253-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), has only a small effect on NORE1A ability to suppress anchorage-independent growth in both A549 and LNCaP cells. Thus, determinants responsible for inhibition of anchorage-independent growth are located in the first 363 amino acids of the protein. We next tested the growth-suppressive capabilities of the N-terminal half of this segment, representing the NORE1A proline-rich and zinc finger domains (aa 1-191), and the C-terminal half, consisting of the Central and RA domains (aa 191-363). As shown in Fig. 1C, NORE1A 1-191 was deficient in suppression of soft agar growth, whereas NORE1A 191-363 efficiently suppressed growth in soft agar. In the case of A549 cells, NORE1A 191-363 was more efficient in growth suppression than wild type NORE1A. Thus, NORE1A growth-suppressive functions are determined by amino acids 191-363 in two cell types, A549 lung adenocarcinoma and LNCaP prostate carcinoma. In our subsequent studies, we focused on the effect of NORE1A on A549 cells, since the potential NORE1A involvement in lung carcinogenesis using this cell line is well described (19Hesson L. Dallol A. Minna J.D. Maher E.R. Latif F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Irimia M. Fraga M.F. Sanchez-Cespedes M. Esteller M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 21938-21943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Next, we tested the effect of the expression of NORE1A truncation mutants on the cell cycle distribution of A549 cells in monolayer. The NORE1A 1-363 and 1-191 truncations induced small changes in the A549 cell cycle distribution, similar to wild type NORE1A (Table 1). In contrast, the expression of NORE1A 191-363 fragment induced a profound arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle with the reciprocal decrease in S and G2/M populations. NORE1A 118-363 was less potent in the induction of G1 arrest, and NORE1A 191-416 displayed a small effect on cell cycle distribution similar to wild type NORE1A (Table 1). These data suggest that the central and RA regions represent the NORE1A effector domain responsible for growth-suppressive effects of this protein and that other domains might regulate growth-suppressive function of the effector domain. NORE1A Is a Centrosomal Protein Capable of Microtubule Binding—We next sought to determine the basis for observed differences in growth-suppressive properties of NORE1A mutants. In preparation for growth-inhibitory assays, we observed that intracellular distributions of NORE1A and its mutants differed from that of hrGFP. Therefore, we determined the subcellular localization of NORE1A and its mutants in cells growing in monolayer by immunofluorescent microscopy. The intracellular distribution of wild type NORE1A is shown in Fig. 2A. In interphase and mitotic nontumorigenic HBEC3-KT cells, endogenous NORE1A was found on dotlike structures positive for γ-tubulin, a centrosomal marker (Fig. 2A, top two rows). Subcellular fractionation of HBEC3-KT cells revealed that the NORE1A was cofractionated with centrosomes, suggesting close association with this organelle (Fig. 2D). We reasoned that NORE1A could either be a resident centrosomal protein or be transported along microtubules and localized to the centrosomes en route. To discriminate between these possibilities, we treated HBEC3-KT cells with 5 μm nocodazole for 4 h to disrupt the microtubule network. The nocodazole treatment did not change subcellular localization of NORE1A, suggesting that NORE1A is a resident centrosomal protein (Fig. 2A, third row). The centrosomal localization of NORE1A was not changed in the presence of activated Ki-Ras in the HBEC3-KTR cells (Fig. 2A, fourth row). In A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells and in primary human small airway epithelial cells, hrGFP-NORE1A, introduced in cells by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, was also localized to centrosomes (supplemental Fig. 2A). In addition, in most A549 cells, NORE1A decorated cytoplasmic fibers positive for α-tubulin, a microtubular marker (Fig. 2A, bottom row). In mitotic A549 cells, GFP-NORE1A was localized to the centrosomes and mitotic spindle (supplemental Fig. 2A). The GFP-NORE1A, expressed in A549 cells, was cofractionat"

The innate immune system is a host defense mechanism that is evolutionarily conserved from insects to human and is mainly involved in the recognition and control of the early stage of infection in all animals (1Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (5994) Google Scholar). It is activated by a group of germ line-encoded receptors and soluble proteins conceptually termed pattern recognition receptors and proteins, respectively. The group recognizes microbial surface determinants that are conserved among microbes but absent in the host. These conserved motifs, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), 2The abbreviations used are: PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; proPO, prophenoloxidase; PO, phenoloxidase; PGN, peptidoglycan; MurNAc, N-acetylmuramic acid; DAP, meso-diaminopimelic acid; PGRP, PGN recognition protein; rhPGRP-S, recombinant human PGRP-S; Tm-PGRP, T. molitor PGN recognition protein; r-Tm-PGRP, recombinant Tm-PGRP; TCT, tracheal cytotoxin. 2The abbreviations used are: PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; proPO, prophenoloxidase; PO, phenoloxidase; PGN, peptidoglycan; MurNAc, N-acetylmuramic acid; DAP, meso-diaminopimelic acid; PGRP, PGN recognition protein; rhPGRP-S, recombinant human PGRP-S; Tm-PGRP, T. molitor PGN recognition protein; r-Tm-PGRP, recombinant Tm-PGRP; TCT, tracheal cytotoxin. include lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), β-1,3-glucan, and mannan. Upon recognition, these receptors activate distinct signaling cascades leading to the expression of genes that participate in innate immune responses, such as expression of cytokines and antimicrobial peptides. Recently, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of cytokines in immune cells in response to stimulation with PAMPs has increased dramatically (2Iwasaki A. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (3247) Google Scholar, 3Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar). Therefore, identification of novel agonists or antagonists of PAMPs that can regulate the signal pathways of innate immune reactions will be useful to elucidate the molecular mechanism of innate immunity (4Means T.K. Jones B.W. Schromm A.B. Shurtleff B.A. Smith J.A. Keane J. Golenbock D.T. Vogel S.N. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4074-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 5Parker L.C. Whyte M.K.

The activation of the prophenoloxidase (proPO) cascade leading to melanization is a major innate immune reaction triggered by LPS, PGN, and β-1,3-glucan and is vital for the survival and development of insects (7Nappi A.J. Vass E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2001; 484: 329-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Melanization plays an important role in defense reactions such as wound healing, encapsulation, sequestration of invading microbes, and the production of toxic quinone intermediates that kill the microorganisms. However, melanin synthesis must be tightly controlled because systemic hyperactivation of the proPO system, excessive formation of quinones, and inappropriate melanin synthesis are also deleterious to the hosts. Only a few inhibitors of the melanization reaction have been identified from insects and crustaceans (8Daquinag A.C. Nakamura S. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Tsukamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, a novel molecule working as a specific competitive inhibitor of PGN-dependent melanization cascade has so far not been found. The identification and characterization of a specific melanization regulatory molecule will provide important information to clarify how the melanization response is regulated and controlled. The proPO activation pathway, like the vertebrate complement system, is a proteolytic cascade containing several serine proteases and their inhibitors and terminates with the zymogen, proPO. Microbial PAMPs such as LPS, PGN, or β-1,3-glucan will first react with pattern recognition proteins, which then will induce the activation of several serine proteases within the proPO system (14Ashida M.

However, the molecular mechanism of how PGN or β-1,3-glucan can activate proPO system and what proteins are involved in PGN or β-1,3-glucan specific proPO cascade are not fully understood at the molecular level. One reason for this is that it is difficult to obtain a fraction showing specific PO activity induced by either PGN or β-1,3-glucan. Because natural PGN and β-1,3-glucan spontaneously activate the proPO system, it is difficult to obtain a PGN or a β-1,3-glucan specific fraction from the crude hemolymph of the insect without activation of the proPO system. An important approach to understanding how natural PGN or β-1,3-glucan specifically induce the activation of proPO system is therefore to obtain a fraction from the crude hemolymph showing either a PGN or a β-1,3-glucan specific PO activities and then purify proteins involved in each pathway. To obtain the specific fraction showing PGN-dependent PO activity, we hypothesized that small PGN fragments would not activate the PGN-dependent proPO system, as is the case with small β-1,3-glucans (17Lee M.H.

PGN is a polymer consisting of glycan strands of alternating GlcNAc and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) that are cross-linked to each other by short peptide bridges (21Schleifer K.H. Stackebrandt E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1983; 17: 143-187Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). PGNs from Gram-negative bacteria and Bacillus species differ from other Gram-positive PGNs by the replacement of Lys with meso-diaminopimelic acid (DAP) at the third amino acid in the peptide chain. It is known that PGN stimulates the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor α in monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils (22Gupta D. Jin Y.P. Dziarski R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2620-2630PubMed Google Scholar). In insects, two different PGN recognition systems are present: one for the induction of antimicrobial peptides and the other for eliciting activation of the melanization cascade. A PGN recognition protein (PGRP) was first identified in the silkworm, Bombyx mori, through purification of a protein from hemolymph that binds to Lys-PGN and activates the proPO cascade system (23Yoshida H. Kinoshita K. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that several PGRPs have been shown to bind directly to PGN, each with distinct preferences for binding Lys- or DAP-PGN (24Kang D. Liu G Lundstrom A. Gelius E. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10078-10082Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 25Liu C. Gelius E. Liu G. Steiner H. Dziarski R. J. Biol.

Immunity. 2004; 20: 637-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). This binding discrimination to Lys-PGN or DAP-PGN leads to the activation of specific immune signaling pathways (Toll and Imd, respectively, in Drosophila). Even though intensive studies of PGN ligand structures and PGN recognition proteins acting upstream of the Drosophila Toll and Imd pathways have been carried out, specific PGRPs that distinguish and recognize either Lys- or DAP-PGN during melanin synthesis have not been characterized yet. Here, we describe the identification of a novel synthetic Lys-PGN fragment, two copies of GlcNAc-MurNAc attached to two l-Ala-d-isoGln-l-Lys-d-Ala peptides (T-4P2), which functions as a competitive inhibitor of the PGN-dependent melanization cascade. By using a T-4P2-coupled column we obtained a β-1,3-glucan-specific and also a PGN-specific melanin synthesizing fraction from the hemolymph of T. molitor larvae. Also, we demonstrate that Tenebrio PGRP purified by using the T-4P2-coupled column works as a common PGN recognition molecule on both Lys- and DAP-PGN-dependent melanization responses. Animal Collection of Hemolymph—T. molitor larvae (mealworm) were maintained on a laboratory bench in terraria containing wheat bran. Hemolymph was collected as previously described (28Lee K.M. Lee K.Y. Choi H.W. Cho M.Y. Kwon T.H. Kawabata S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3695-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The collected crude hemolymph was centrifuged at 203,000 × g for 4 h at 4°C. The supernatant was taken as hemolymph and then stored at –80 °C until use. Assay of PO Activity and Measurements of Melanin Syntheses—An assay of PO was carried out according to our previously published method (19Lee K.Y. Zhang R. Kim M.S. Park J.W. Park H.Y. Kawabata S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4375-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, to measure PO activity, 30 μl of crude hemolymph (350 μg of proteins) or fractionated solution from T-4P2 column chromatography was preincubated in 70 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 μg of β-1,3-glucan or soluble Lys-PGN (10 ng) or DAP-PGN (50 ng) for 10 min at 30 °C, and then 400 μl of substrate solution (1 mm 4-methyl-catechol, 2 mm 4-hydroxyproline ethylester in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm CaCl2) was added to the reaction mixture. After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, the increase in absorbance at 520 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer. One unit of PO activity was defined as the amount of enzyme causing an increase in absorbance of one at 520 nm/20 min of incubation (A520/20 min). Melanin synthesis was measured according to a method published previously (28Lee K.M. Lee K.Y. Choi H.W. Cho M.Y. Kwon T.H. Kawabata S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3695-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 μl of crude hemolymph (350 μg of proteins) was preincubated with 10 μl of β-1,3-glucan (1 μg) or natural soluble Lys- or DAP-PGN at 30 °C for 10 min. After incubation, 460 μl of the substrate solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm dopamine and 10 mm CaCl2) was added to the reaction mixture and then incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The increase in absorbance at 400 nm, which records melanin formation, was measured. Preparation of Natural Soluble PGNs—Insoluble Lys-PGN of Staphylococcus aureus and LPS 0111B4 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Soluble Micrococcus letus Lys-PGN and curdlan were obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals. Insoluble DAP-PGN from Escherichia coli BW25113 Δlpp was purified by a method previously described (26Leulier F. Parquet C. Pili-Floury S. Ryu J.H. Caroff M. Lee W.J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Lemaitre B. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Insoluble DAP-PGN from Bacillius subtilis was generously given by Dr. Bruno Lemaitre (CNRS). Natural soluble Lys- and DAP-PGN that can induce melanin synthesis were prepared from insoluble S. aureus and insoluble E. coli PGNs, respectively, according to the method of Rosenthal and Dziarski (29Rosenthal R.S. Dziarski R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 253-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because the obtained soluble PGN are a mixture of active and inactive PGN fragments, we estimated the potency of proPO activation by using commercially available soluble M. leteus Lys-PGN as a reference PGN. Syntheses of Lys-PGN Fragments, Preparation of Synthetic PGN Fragments, Immobilized Columns, and Binding Assay—PGN partial structures with two copies of 1,4-β-linked GlcNAc-MurNAc attached to l-Ala-d-isoGln (tetrasaccharide-dipeptide, T-2P2), l-Ala-d-isoGln-l-Lys (T-3P2), l-Ala-d-isoGln-l-Lys (Ac) (T-3P2A), l-Ala-d-isoGln-l-Lys-d-Ala (T-4P2), l-Ala-d-isoGln-l-Lys(Ac)-d-Ala (T-4P2A), l-Ala-d-isoGln-l-Lys(Ac)-d-Ala-d-Ala (T-5P2), and l-Ala-d-isoGln-l-Lys(Ac)-d-Ala-d-Ala (T-5P2A) are shown in Fig. 1A. The (GlcNAc-MurNAc)2 counterparts lacking peptide moieties were synthesized as reported (30Inamura S. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Tetrahedron Lett. 2001; 42: 7613-7616Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The detailed total synthesis methods of these molecules are reported elsewhere (31Inamura S. Fujimoto Y. Kawasaki A. Shiokawa Z. Woelk E. Lindner H.H. Inohara N. Shoichi Kusumoto S. Fukase K. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2006; 4: 232-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T-3P2A, T-4P2A, and T-5P2A were designated the acetylated derivatives on the amino group of the lysine residue. The structures were confirmed with electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF MS) and NMR spectra, and the observed mass spectra were as follows (ESI-TOF MS (negative)): T-2P2, m/z 685.3 [M-2H]2–; T-3P2, m/z 834.5 [M-2H]2–; T-3P2A, m/z 876.4 [M-2H]2–; T-4P2, m/z 905.1 [M-2H]2–; T-4P2A, m/z 947.5 [M-2H]2–; T-5P2, m/z 976.64 [M-2H]2–; and T-5P2A, m/z 1018.5 [M-2H]2–. We have made synthetic Lys-PGN fragment (T-2P2, T-3P2, T-4P2, and T-5P2)-immobilized resins by coupling synthetic PGN fragments to CNBr-activated Sepharose following the manufacturer's instructions. The purified tracheal cytotoxin (TCT; Fig. 1B) from E. coli DAP-PGN was kindly given by Dr. Byung-Ha Oh (Pohang University, Pohang, Korea). Purification of Tenebrio PGN Recognition Protein (Tm-PGRP) and cDNA Cloning of Tm-PGRP—To purify proteins that can recognize T-4P2 from the hemolymph of T. molitor larvae, 100 ml of crude hemolymph (1300 mg of proteins) was applied to a T-4P2-immobilized Sepharose column (2.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 3 mm EDTA) at 0.6 ml/min. After washing this column with buffer A, bound proteins were eluted at a rate of 0.5 ml/min with buffer A containing 1 m NaCl. The eluted fractions were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions. The fractions containing the 20-kDa band were collected, and the 20-kDa protein was purified to homogeneity by using chromatography first on a Toyopearl HW-55S size exclusion column, then on a hydroxyapatite column, and finally on a Mono-Q ion exchange column. Briefly, the eluted fractions from the T-4P2-coupled column were concentrated by ultrafiltration through a membrane filter (Amicon; YM10). About 1 ml of the concentrated solution was applied to a Toyopearl HW-55S column (1 × 30 cm) equilibrated with buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl and was then eluted with buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 12 ml/h. Fractions containing the 20-kDa protein were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The concentrate (1 ml) was diluted 10-fold with 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) and loaded to a hydroxyapatite column (0.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate. The absorbed protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 10–300 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), and the pooled fractions containing the 20-kDa protein from the hydroxyapatite column were concentrated. Then the concentrate (1 ml) was diluted 10-fold with buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) and subjected to Mono-Q fast protein liquid chromatography column equilibrated with buffer B. The column was developed with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in buffer B. To determine the partial amino acid sequences of the 20-kDa protein, the purified protein (25 μg) was reduced, alkylated, and digested with 2 μg of lysylendopeptidase at 37 °C for 13 h. The digested peptides were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography on a C18 reverse phase column (Gilson) with a linear gradient between 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water and 0.052% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile. The N-terminal sequence and the internal sequences of the 20-kDa protein were determined on an Applied Biosystem Procise automated gas phase amino acid sequencer. A cDNA library from T. molitor larvae was constructed as previously described (16Zhang R. Cho H.Y. Kim H.S. Ma Y.G. Osaki T. Kawabata S. Söderhäll K. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42072-42079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) by using a ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene). Three internal sequences and N-terminal sequence of the 20-kDa protein were determined. Among them, an oligonucleotide corresponding to DFLQCGVE was synthesized as follows: 5′-GAYTTYYTICARTGYGGIGTIG-3′ and it was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. We screened 5 × 104 colonies and obtained six hybridization-positive clones. We analyzed two plasmids containing three internal sequences and the N-terminal sequence. PGN Binding Specificity of the Purified Tm-PGRP—To examine the binding specificity of synthetic Lys-PGN fragments and insoluble DAP- and Lys-PGN against the purified Tm-PGRP, the binding assay was performed according to our previously published method (17Lee M.H. Osaki T. Lee J.Y. Baek M.J. Zhang R. Park J.W. Kawabata S. Söderhäll K. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3218-3227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of the purified Tm-PGRP was mixed with 40 μl of 50% (v/v) suspension of the Lys-PGN fragment-coupled resins, insoluble DAP-PGN (500 μg), and insoluble Lys-PGN (500 μg) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) at 4 °C overnight with rocking. Unbound Tm-PGRP of the supernatant and bound Tm-PGRP recovered from the resins were analyzed by Western blot analysis using Tm-PGRP antibody. As control, agarose resin (Bio-Rad) and GlcNAc-coupled agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) were treated as described above. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Tm-PGRP (r-Tm-PGRP)—The cDNA encoding the mature Tm-PGRP was subcloned into BamHI and HindIII sites of pFASTBAC-SEa vector as previously described, which was modified from pFASTBAC-HTc (Invitrogen) to insert the Mellitin signal sequence for secretion (32Piao S. Kim D. Won Park J.W. Lee B.L. Ha N.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1752: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The recombinant baculovirus for expression of the Tm-PGRP was generated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The recombinant virus was amplified using Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf-9; Invitrogen) cells in SF-900II serum-free medium (Invitrogen) at 27 °C. For the large production of the protein, Trichoplusia ni BTI-TN-5B1-4 (High-five; Invitrogen) cells were grown at 27 °C. The cells were infected with a cell density of 2 × 106 cells/ml at a multiplicity of infection of 5 and then were incubated for 36 h. The medium containing the r-Tm-PGRP was harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min. The medium was concentrated to 100 ml using Amicon RA-2000 concentrator (10-kDa cut-off; Amicon) and was then dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl. After clearing by centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography to purify the r-Tm-PGRP containing the N-terminal hexahistidine tag cleavable by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease. The recombinant protein was eluted with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, and 200 mm imidazole. The eluted fractions were pooled and stored at –80 °C until use. In Vitro Reconstitution Experiments—Reconstitution experiments were performed with the pass-through fraction from the T-4P2-coupled column, which is devoid of Tm-PGRP, and the purified Tm-PGRP in the presence of DAP-PGN, Lys-PGN, or β-1,3-glucan to examine whether it was possible to obtain proPO system specific for either DAP-PGN, Lys-PGN or β-1,3-glucan. To ascertain the generation of activated Tenebrio PO from β-1,3-glucan- or PGN-specific melanization fraction, the reaction mixture after activation with PGN or β-1,3-glucan were analyzed on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The N-terminal sequences of the generated PO bands on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were determined as described above. DAP-PGN, Lys-PGN, and β-1,3-Glucan but Not LPS Activate Tenebrio Melanization Cascade—Microbial cell wall components are well known activators of the proPO system leading to melanin synthesis (14Ashida M. Brey P.T. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects.in: Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Chapman & Hall, New York1998: 135-172Google Scholar, 15Cerenius L. Söderhäll K. Immunol.

To elucidate the microbial determinants that activate the proPO system and to compare the potency of melanin synthesis by these activators, we examined the PO activity and melanin synthesis by using LPS, DAP-PGN, or Lys-PGN and β-1,3-glucan (Fig. 2). Fungal β-1,3-glucan and S. aureus soluble Lys-PGN strongly induced the PO activities and melanin syntheses (columns 2 and 5 in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). On the other hand, soluble DAP-PGN of E. coli, but not LPS of E. coli, is a weaker activator of the proPO system and melanin syntheses (columns 8 and 12, respectively), indicating that LPS may be not responsible for the activation of Tenebrio proPO cascade. These results are also consistent with experiments in flies showing that DAP- and Lys-PGN, but not LPS, effectively activated the signal pathways leading to the induction of antimicrobial peptides (26Leulier F. Parquet C. Pili-Floury S. Ryu J.H. Caroff M. Lee W.J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Lemaitre B. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 27Kaneko T. Goldman W.E. Mellroth P. Steiner H. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Harley W. Fox A. Golenbock D. Silverman N. Immunity. 2004; 20: 637-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). However, recently it was demonstrated that lipid A (a component of LPS) can activate melanization cascade with a Bombyx proPO system (27Kaneko T. Goldman W.E. Mellroth P. Steiner H. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Harley W. Fox A. Golenbock D. Silverman N. Immunity. 2004; 20: 637-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). When we examined the effect of lipid A on Tenebrio melanin synthesis, lipid A did not induce the activation of the proPO system and melanin synthesis (data not shown). These results suggest that LPS is not responsible for the activation of Tenebrio melanization cascade. To exclude the possibility that melanin synthesis induced by E. coli DAP-PGN is attributed to the contaminated E. coli LPS, polymyxin B has been added into the reaction mixture to determine whether the melanin synthesis is due to LPS. Polymyxin B is a LPS-binding antibiotic that has been widely used as LPS-neutralizing reagent to avoid the possible interference of LPS contaminations (34Tsubery H. Ofek I. Cohen S. Fridkin M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11837-11844Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35Nikulina M. Habich C. Flohe S.B. Scott F.W. Kolb H. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1925-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). After incubation with soluble DAP-PGN (50 ng) with polymyxin B (10 μg) and then PO activity and melanin synthesis were examined (column 9). The PO activity was not affected by the incubation of polymyxin B, indicating that DAP-PGN is not contaminated with E. coli LPS. This result suggests that DAP-PGN is the activator of the Tenebrio proPO system. However, the ability of DAP-PGN to induce proPO activation was weaker than that of Lys-PGN. Furthermore, because soluble DAP-PGN containing polymeric structures has been shown to trigger melanin synthesis, we tried to find whether the purified monomeric disaccharid"
https://openalex.org/W1994397721,"The glycine betaine carrier BetP from Corynebacterium glutamicum was recently shown to function as both an osmosensor and osmoregulator in proteoliposomes made from Escherichia coli phospholipids by sensing changes in the internal K+ concentration as a measure of hyperosmotic stress (Rübenhagen, R., Morbach, S., and Krämer, R. (2001) EMBO J. 20, 5412–5420). Furthermore, evidence was provided that a stretch of 25 amino acids of the C-terminal domain of BetP is critically involved in K+ sensing. This K+-sensitive region has been further characterized. Glu572 turned out to be important for osmosensing in E. coli cells and in proteoliposomes made from E. coli phospholipids. BetP mutants E572K, E572P, and E572A/H573A/R574A were unable to detect an increase in the internal K+ concentration in this membrane environment. However, these BetP variants regained their ability to detect osmotic stress in membranes with increased phosphatidylglycerol content, i.e. in intact C. glutamicum cells or in proteoliposomes mimicking the composition of the C. glutamicum membrane. Mutants E572P and Y550P were still insensitive to osmotic stress also in this membrane background. These results led to the following conclusions. (i) The K+ sensor in mutants E572Q, E572D, and E572K is only partially impaired. (ii) Restoration of activity regulation is not possible if the correct conformation or orientation of the C-terminal domain is compromised by a proline residue at position 572 or 550.

Frequent fluctuation of external osmolality is one of the most common stress situations that soil bacteria encounter in their native surroundings, affecting the cell's hydration, volume, and/or turgor pressure. A widely distributed strategy of eubacteria to overcome hyperosmotic stress is the accumulation of compatible solutes, such as glycine betaine, proline, and trehalose, by biosynthesis and/or uptake, thereby avoiding dehydration of the cytoplasm (1Wood J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 230-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bremer E. Krämer R. Bacterial Stress Responses.in: Storz G. Hengge-Aronis R.

In general, the first response to hyperosmotic conditions is the activation of uptake systems for compatible solutes because uptake is energetically cheaper and faster than de novo synthesis. Corynebacterium glutamicum, a GC-rich Gram-positive soil bacterium important for industrial amino acid production (4Krämer R. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 13: 75-93Crossref Google Scholar), possesses five secondary carriers for the uptake of compatible solutes (3Morbach S. Krämer R. ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 384-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In other bacteria, e.g. Escherichia coli (1Wood J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5583-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The functional reconstitution of purified BetP in liposomes demonstrated that this transporter harbors altogether three functions: (i) catalytic activity of glycine betaine transport, (ii) sensing of osmotic stress, and (iii) osmoregulation, i.e. adjustment of the transport rate to the extent of hypertonicity (12Rübenhagen R.

Other compatible solute transporters that are known to be both osmosensors and osmoregulators are the secondary transporter ProP from E. coli (13Racher K.I. Voegele R.T. Marshall E.V. Culham D.E.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7102-7106Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of activation of osmosensors is still under debate. Important questions concern the physicochemical stimulus correlated with osmotic stress and the domain within these carriers important for signal detection. Proteoliposomes are well suited for analyzing the nature of the osmotic stimulus because the internal and external space of the liposomes and the membrane composition can be freely varied. This allows a change in only one of the possible parameters at a time (e.g. changes in the external or internal osmolality, solute or ion concentration, membrane strain, osmotic gradient, or molecular crowding (1Wood J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 230-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) without varying any other condition. Using this approach, we were recently able to demonstrate that BetP is triggered by changes in the internal K+ (or Rb+ and Cs+) concentration, whereas changes in membrane strain, external osmolality, or other internal parameters have no effect (10Rübenhagen R. Morbach S. Krämer R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5412-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 15Schiller D. Krämer R. Morbach S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The characterization of BetP mutants in proteoliposomes with truncations of the C-terminal domain by 12, 25, or 45 amino acids indicated that this domain is at least critically involved in signal input related to osmotic stress. In agreement with this observation, BetPΔ25, which harbors a truncated C-terminal domain, was found to be unable to detect changes in the internal K+ concentration (11Schiller D. Krämer R. Morbach S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5583-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These results do of course not rule out that additional regions within BetP besides the C-terminal domain may be involved in detection of the internal K+ concentration. The aim of this work was to characterize the putative K+-sensitive region within the last 25 amino acids of the C-terminal domain. For this purpose, amino acids within this domain were systematically substituted with alanine residues; or, in an independent approach, Glu572 was replaced with glutamine, aspartate, lysine, or proline. The regulation patterns of these mutants dependent upon the external osmolality (and thus dependent upon the internal K+ concentration) were determined in different membrane surroundings (E. coli and C. glutamicum cells and proteoliposomes made of E. coli- and C. glutamicum-like lipids) to characterize the K+ sensitivity of these mutants. We present evidence that Glu572 is critically involved in K+ sensing. It turned out that not the negative charge at position 572, but rather a correct folding of this region seems to be necessary for the sensing process. Furthermore, we found a significant impact of the phosphatidylglycerol (PG) 2The abbreviations used are: PG, phosphatidylglycerol; DOPG, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)); DOPC, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphosphocholine; DOPE, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine; DOPS, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. content of the membrane on the sensitivity of BetP to the internal K+ signal.

The plasmids used for the heterologous expression of betP in E. coli were based on the pASK-IBA5 vector (IBA GmbH, Göttingen, Germany), in which Strep-betP is under the control of the tet promoter. All constructs are summarized in Table 1. E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with carbenicillin (50 μg/ml). Induction was carried out in exponentially growing cells upon the addition of 200 μg of anhydrotetracycline/liter of culture. For the homologous expression of betP in C. glutamicum, strain DHPF (18Steger R. Weinand M. Krämer R. Morbach S.

In this case, the different betP genes were under the control of the ptac promoter of plasmid pXMJ19 (19Jakoby M. Ngouoto-Nkili C. Burkovski A. Biotechnol.

Subsequently, these cells were used to inoculate a fresh culture, in which betP expression was induced by 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside.TABLE 1Plasmids used in this studyPlasmidDescriptionRef.pAcl1pASK-IBA5-betP-C252T, ApRRef. 10Rübenhagen R.

For this purpose, a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) was used. The desired mutations were introduced in the primer sequence summarized in Table 2. Mutagenesis was carried out according to the description of the manufacturer. The betP sequence encoding the last 160 nucleotides was sequenced for as a control to prove that, besides the desired mutation, no other nucleotide exchange was present. The sequenced fragment was isolated from the plasmid after restriction with XhoI (or, in the case of Y550P, with AflII) and HindIII and exchanged with the identically treated fragment of pAcl1, leading to the different plasmids listed in Table 1. For the expression of betP in C. glutamicum, the betP fragment was isolated from the respective pAcl1 derivative using the restriction nucleases XbaI and NaeI.

Rönsch H. Jung H. Krämer R. Morbach S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 735-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). From a standard cultivation, we routinely obtained 200 μg of highly pure BetP/liter of cell culture. For reconstitution, liposomes (5 mg/ml phospholipids) prepared from phospholipids of E. coli polar lipid extract (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL) were preformed by extrusion (13 cycles) through polycarbonate filters (400-nm pore size). The liposomes were titrated by the stepwise addition of 20% (v/v) Triton X-100. The insertion of detergent in the liposomes was followed by measurement of the turbidity at 540 nm. Upon saturation with detergent, the liposomes were mixed with solubilized BetP at a lipid/protein ratio of 30:1 (w/w). This mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Then, Bio-Beads at ratios (w/w) of 5 (Bio-Beads/Triton X-100) and 10 (Bio-Beads/dodecyl maltoside) were added to remove the detergent and incubated at room temperature for 1 h under gentle agitation. Fresh Bio-Beads were added, and incubation was continued for 1 h. Subsequently, the double amount of Bio-Beads was added, and incubation was continued overnight at 4 °C. Then, Bio-Beads at a w/w ratio as described above were added and incubated for 1 h. Finally, the proteoliposomes were centrifuged and washed twice with 100 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.5) before they were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Preparation of Liposomes from Synthetic Phospholipids—1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-rac-(1-glycerol) (DOPG) and a mixture of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphosphocholine (DOPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) (1:1 mol/mol), which were dissolved in chloroform (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.), were dried under vacuum before they were dissolved in 100 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.5) by agitation for 24 h. To avoid oxidation, the lipids were kept under a N2 atmosphere. Subsequently, the liposomes were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Variation of the Lipid Composition—To vary the membrane composition in the liposome system, proteoliposomes made from E. coli phospholipids were fused with liposomes composed of synthetic phospholipids. The fraction of synthetic lipids was varied between 16 and 66% of the total lipid content of the preparation. For this purpose, proteoliposomes were mixed with either DOPC/DOPE or DOPG liposomes at the indicated ratios and extruded (20 times) before they were frozen in liquid nitrogen. After gentle thawing, the mixture was kept for 45 min at 20 °C and extruded 20 times trough a polycarbonate filter (400-nm pore size) before the proteoliposomes were used for transport assays. Transport Assays—Uptake of [14C]glycine betaine in proteoliposomes was determined essentially as described (12Rübenhagen R. Rönsch H. Jung H. Krämer R. Morbach S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 735-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, after thawing, proteoliposomes were extruded 13 times through a polycarbonate filter (400-nm pore size) in 100 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.5), collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in the extrusion buffer to a lipid concentration of ∼60 mg/ml lipid. Normally, the proteoliposomes have a protein concentration varying between 0.8 and 1.0 mg/ml. An appropriate amount of proteoliposomes (containing ∼2–2.5 μg of BetP) was diluted 200-fold into potassium-free buffer (20 mm sodium Pi (pH 7.5) and 25 mm NaCl) containing 15 μm [14C]glycine betaine and 1 μm valinomycin to create an outwardly directed K+ diffusion potential. To establish hyperosmotic conditions, sorbitol was added to the external buffer. After different time intervals (up to 20 s after the addition of the liposomes), samples were taken and filtered rapidly through 0.22-μm GS nitrocellulose filters (Millipore Corp., Eschborn, Germany). The filters were washed with 100 mm LiCl, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Control experiments were carried out to show that the washing conditions did not lead to the efflux of glycine betaine due to the hypo-osmotic washing conditions (supplemental Fig. S1A). The betaine uptake rate was calculated from the initial slope of the uptake kinetics (supplemental Fig. S2). In experiments in which internal solutes were varied, proteoliposomes were resuspended in the desired buffer, and the internal buffer was exchanged by extrusion as described previously (10Rübenhagen R. Morbach S. Krämer R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5412-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Uptake of [14C]glycine betaine in E. coli cells was determined as follows. E. coli MKH13 cells expressing the gene of the Strep-BetP derivative were cultivated in LB medium supplemented with carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) up to A600 = 1.5. Synthesis of the Strep-BetP mutants was initiated by the addition of 200 μg/liter anhydrotetracycline. The cells were harvested after 2 h, washed with 100 mm Tris/Mes (pH 7.5), and resuspended in the same buffer containing 20 mm glucose. Unless noted otherwise, cells for the uptake measurements were assayed in 100 mm Tris/Mes (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm glucose, 50 mm NaCl, and sorbitol concentrations varying between 50 and 850 mm. Subsequently, cells were stirred for 3 min at 37 °C before the reaction was started by the addition of 250 μm [14C]glycine betaine. At given time intervals (15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 s after the addition of glycine betaine), samples were taken, filtered on GF glass fiber filters (Schleicher & Schüll GmbH, Dassel, Germany), and washed twice with 2.5 ml of 500 mm sucrose and 50 mm MgCl2. The radioactivity on the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. In all cases, a linear dependence of the amount of glycine betaine taken up on the reaction time after the addition of glycine betaine was observed (supplemental Fig. S3). For transport assays, C. glutamicum DHPF cells harboring the different betP genes in pXMJ19 were grown for 10 h in brain heart infusion medium in the presence of 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol before they were transferred into fresh medium. The expression of betP genes was induced by the addition of 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 16 h, cells were harvested and washed once with cold 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm NaCl. The cells were suspended in the same buffer containing 10 mm glucose. Unless noted otherwise, cells for the uptake measurements were assayed in 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.5) with 10 mm glucose, 50 mm NaCl, and different sorbitol concentrations to vary the osmolality between 250 and 1500 mosmol/kg. Subsequently, cells were stirred for 3 min at 30 °C before the reaction was started by the addition of 250 μm [14C]glycine betaine. At given time intervals (15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 s), samples were taken, filtered on GF glass fiber filters, and washed twice with 2.5 ml of 100 mm LiCl. Control experiments were carried out to show that the washing conditions did not lead to the efflux of glycine betaine due to the hypo-osmotic washing conditions (supplemental Fig. S1B). The radioactivity on the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. In all cases, a linear dependence of the amount of betaine taken up on the reaction time after the addition of glycine betaine was observed (supplemental Fig. S3). Western Blot Analysis—To control the concentration of the BetP mutants integrated into the membrane of E. coli MKH13 cells, Western blot analysis of membrane extracts was performed as described (11Schiller D. Krämer R. Morbach S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5583-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Rübenhagen R. Rönsch H. Jung H. Krämer R. Morbach S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 735-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) using antibodies raised against BetP. This antibody is highly specific for BetP as documented in supplemental Fig. S4, in which the complete Western blot of Fig. 3A is shown. Previous studies in intact cells and proteoliposomes have indicated that the last 25 amino acids of the C-terminal domain of BetP, which consists altogether of 55 amino acids, are directly involved in osmosensing and/or osmoregulation (9Peter H. Burkovski A. Krämer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2567-2574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Schiller D. Krämer R. Morbach S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5583-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Detailed in vitro analyses revealed that BetP senses osmotic stress via increasing internal K+ concentrations (10Rübenhagen R. Morbach S. Krämer R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5412-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To define the K+-sensitive region in more detail, a series of BetP mutants was constructed by systematically changing the C-terminal 25 amino acid residues (Fig. 1). These recombinant forms of BetP were based on BetP C252T, a Cys-less version of the carrier that is regulated like wild-type BetP (11Schiller D. Krämer R. Morbach S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5583-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Activity measurements were performed by increasing the external osmolality of cells or proteoliposomes. In both test systems, this leads to an immediate efflux of water out of the lumen or, in other words, to an increase in all luminal solutes. Due to the fact that K+ is the only cation present in our liposomes, the internal K+ concentration increases, depending on the extent of the applied external osmotic shift, in a range between 180 and 980 mm. This will occur in a similar manner in whole cells because K+ is the predominant cytoplasmic cation in E. coli and C. glutamicum (20Guillouet S. Engasser J.M. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1995; 43: 315-320Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Record M.T. Courtenay E.S. Cayley D.S. Guttmann H.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 23: 143-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Upon the increase in K+, wild-type BetP is activated after applying an osmotic upshift. Thus, both test systems are suitable to investigate changes in the osmoregulatory behavior of BetP mutants. Osmoregulation of BetP Mutants in E. coli MKH13—To identify the amino acid residues within the stretch of the last 25 amino acids relevant for K+ sensing by BetP, alanine scanning was performed. Three amino acid residues at a time were exchanged with three alanine residues. The resulting eight mutants were characterized in the heterologous host E. coli (Fig. 2). E. coli proved to be a suitable system for this analysis because the regulation patterns of the previously characterized truncated mutants BetPΔ12, BetPΔ25, and BetPΔ45 were shown to be identical in E. coli and C. glutamicum cells (9Peter H. Burkovski A. Krämer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2567-2574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Schiller D. Krämer R. Morbach S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5583-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For the plasmid-encoded expression of betP mutants, MKH13 (an E. coli strain deficient in transport of compatible solutes) was used (16Haardt M. Kempf B. Faatz E. Bremer E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Consequently, glycine betaine uptake depended exclusively on BetP activity. To analyze whether these mutant proteins were integrated into the E. coli membrane to a similar extent compared with BetP C252T, Western blot analyses were performed (Fig. 2A). BetP was found to be present in comparable amounts in the membranes of MKH13 derivatives; thus, changes in the regulation behavior of the BetP variants cannot be attributed to different carrier concentrations in E. coli membranes. In betaine uptake measurements, the external osmolality was varied between 0.2 and 1.0 osmol/kg. Only BetP E572A/H573A/R574A turned out not to be regulated by the external osmolality. All other mutants still responded to osmolality changes, but the regulation pattern of these mutants differed from that of the control (Fig. 2, B and C). Either the activity at low osmolalities was increased (e.g. BetP K581A/R582A/R583A), or the overall activity was decreased. (e.g. BetP K593A/R594A/R595A). Taken together, these results revealed that only E572A/H573A/R574A was strongly changed in its response to external osmolality. The gradual changes in activity regulation of the other mutants may be an indication that the complete stretch of 25 amino acids contributes to the extent of K+ sensing and/or regulation. To investigate whether the presence of negative charges within the stretch of the terminal 25 amino acids is important for osmosensing, in an independent approach, the anionic residues (Glu572, Glu577, and Glu585) were mutated to glutamine, leading to BetP mutants E572Q, E577Q, and E585Q. After heterologous expression of the respective mutant genes in MKH13, transport measurements revealed that E572Q was most severely impaired in osmostress-i"

Xie Q.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2723) Google Scholar). The homodimeric enzyme consists of a reductase domain, which binds FMN, FAD, and NADPH, and an oxygenase domain, which binds the heme and tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B) cofactors. During catalysis, electrons flow from NADPH through FMN and FAD in the reductase domain of one subunit of the homodimer to the oxygenase domain of the other subunit (5Siddhanta U. Presta A. Fan B.

They show that the heme is coordinated by a cysteine residue on the proximal side, as in cytochrome P450-type enzymes, and that the substrate (l-Arg or N-hydroxyarginine) binds above the heme iron atom in the distal pocket, whereas the cofactor (H4B) binds along the side of the heme. It is well accepted that dimerization is essential for NOS function (1Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys.

The heme group, the H4B cofactor, and the substrate have all been shown to contribute to dimer stability (12Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bachinger H.P. Mayer B.

In iNOS, the N-terminal region (between residues 76 and 111, comprising a β-hairpin hook and a CXXXC zinc-binding motif) is also believed to be important for stabilizing the dimeric structure. Crane et al. (17Crane B.R. Rosenfeld R.J. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Ghosh S. Tainer J.A. Stuehr D.J. Getzoff E.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6271-6281Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) reported that the N-terminal region of the iNOS oxygenase domain (iNOSoxy) can be in either a “swapped” or an “unswapped” conformation, as illustrated in Fig. 1. In the unswapped conformation, Cys104 and Cys109 in the zinc-binding motif of each subunit of the dimer are tetrahedrally coordinated to a single zinc ion at the dimer interface, and the β-hairpin hook interacts primarily with its own subunit; in the swapped conformation, Cys109 forms a self-symmetric disulfide bond across the dimer interface, and the β-hairpin hook in one subunit of the dimer interacts primarily with the other subunit across the interface (17Crane B.R. Rosenfeld R.J. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Ghosh S. Tainer J.A. Stuehr D.J. Getzoff E.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6271-6281Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Crane et al. proposed that the conformational switch between the two structures may play an important role in NOS stability and function in vivo. It has been found that NO produced from the catalytic reaction in iNOS not only can rebind to the heme iron, thereby directly inhibiting the turnover of the enzyme (18Abu-Soud H.M. Wang J.

Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6876-6881Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), but also can induce monomerization of the functional dimers (16Chen Y. Panda K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4618-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although binding of l-Arg and H4B to iNOS promotes the formation of a “tight” dimer, which is resistant to monomerization by NO, it has been shown that the NO-induced monomers cannot be reverted back to the dimeric state by the addition of l-Arg and H4B (16Chen Y. Panda K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4618-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The dimer inhibition function of NO has also been reported in endothelial NOS by Ravi et al. (20Ravi K. Brennan L.A. Levic S. Ross P.A. Black S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2619-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), who discovered that exogenous NO induces S-nitrosylation of a Cys residue in the zinc-binding motif, thereby reducing the dimer level and the associated enzymatic activity. Another type of dimer inhibition function of NO in iNOS has been demonstrated in the RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage cell line by Albakri and Stuehr (21Albakri Q.A. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5414-5421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), who found that NO produced by iNOS induced by cytokines limits the intracellular assembly of iNOS into the dimeric form by preventing heme insertion and decreasing heme availability. Although it is clear that NO plays an important role in regulating the monomer-dimer equilibrium, the molecular mechanism underlying the NO-induced structural transition remains poorly understood. Here, we systematically studied the interaction between NO and wild-type iNOSoxy as well as two mutants (D92A and K82A) by optical absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopies; in addition, the chemical modifications of the protein matrix induced by NO were examined by mass spectrometry. The data reveal a detailed mechanism of the inhibitory and regulatory effects of NO, as a heme iron ligand, a cysteine-modifying agent, and an inhibitor of dimerization. (6R)-5,6,7,8-Tetrahydro-l-biopterin was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). All other reagents were from Sigma. Murine wild-type iNOSoxy and mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and prepared as described previously (17Crane B.R. Rosenfeld R.J. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Ghosh S. Tainer J.A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 26489-26499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For urea-containing samples, urea was added from a 12 m stock solution and allowed to equilibrate for 3 h prior to the measurements. To form the NO-bound complexes, 400 μl of 1 atm NO was injected into N2-purged solutions sealed in an optical cuvette. All spectroscopic measurements were made under anaerobic conditions. Optical Absorption and Resonance Raman Measurements—Optical absorption and resonance Raman spectra were obtained as described previously (22Li D. Stuehr D.J. Yeh S.-R. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26489-26499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For these measurements, the protein was kept in 40 mm EPPS at pH 7.6. The concentrations used are listed in the figure legends. The time-dependent optical spectra were deconvoluted using a program written with Mathcad software (Mathsoft, Cambridge, MA). In each case, the reference for the six-coordinate NO-bound species was taken immediately after the addition of NO. The reference spectrum for the five-coordinate species for all fittings was taken following incubation of the 4 m urea-treated sample with NO for >15 h. The kinetic traces were fitted using commercial software (Origin, RockWare, Golden, CO). Mass Spectrometric Measurements—The NO-treated iNOSoxy samples were generated by incubating the enzyme with NO for 12 h under anaerobic conditions at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by purging the NO with argon gas. All samples were then digested aerobically with modified trypsin (sequence-grade; Promega Corp.) in ammonium bicarbonate buffer overnight at 37 °C. All digestion products were desalted, separated by gradient elution with a Dionex reverse phase capillary/nano high pressure liquid chromatography system, and analyzed using an Applied Biosystems QSTAR XL tandem mass spectrometer with the hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight configuration. IDA (information-dependent acquisition) software was employed for automatic acquisition of mass spectrometric and tandem mass spectrometric data. The iNOSoxy sample without NO treatment was used as a control. To test the presence of disulfide bonds, half of the digestion products of the urea-treated sample were treated with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate to reduce possible disulfide bonds; the free cysteine residues were then alkylated with freshly prepared iodoacetamide (55 mm in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate buffer); and the resulting sample was subsequently subjected to the mass spectrometric analysis. Size Exclusion Chromatographic Analysis—The Superdex 200 10/30 GL column was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The iNOS samples (100 μl of 10-20 μm) were incubated first with 50 μm H4B and 5 mm l-Arg for >3 h and then with 0-7 m urea for 3 h. They were loaded onto the column pre-equilibrated with 40 mm EPPS at pH 7.6 at the specified concentrations of urea. The flow rate was 0.35 ml/min for all measurements, which were carried out at 4 °C, and the samples were run for 1.5 column volumes. The PAR Zinc Chelation Assay—4-(2-Pyridylazo)resorcinol monosodium salt (PAR) was purchased from Sigma. The zinc content was measured by the PAR assay as described previously (23Miller R.T. Martasek P. Raman C.S. Masters B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14537-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The iNOSoxy·NO complex was prepared as described above. PAR was added to yield a final concentration of 8 μm. As a control, PAR was added to a ferric iNOSoxy sample at the same concentration. To isolate the contributions in the spectra from PAR in ferric iNOSoxy plus PAR and iNOSoxy·NO plus PAR, the corresponding iNOSoxy spectra were subtracted. To evaluate the effect of NO on the dimeric interactions in iNOSoxy, the substrate- and cofactor-free ferric enzyme was subjected to NO, and the reactions were monitored by optical absorption spectroscopy as a function of time. As shown in Fig. 2a, immediately after the addition of NO, a species with a Soret absorption maximum at 439 nm and visible absorption bands at 549 and 580 nm was produced. It was assigned as a six-coordinate (6C) NO-bound ferric iNOSoxy complex because its spectra are analogous to those of other reported 6C NO-bound NOS complexes (24Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10512-10516Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The 6C NO-bound ferric enzyme gradually converted to a species with a Soret maximum at ∼390 nm over an ∼300-min time period with a clear isosbestic point at 411 nm. The new species was assigned as a five-coordinate (5C) derivative of iNOSoxy because its spectral properties are similar to those of other 5C derivatives of NOS (22Li D. Stuehr D.J. Yeh S.-R. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26489-26499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10512-10516Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The properties of the 5C species are discussed below. To further evaluate the mechanism of the 6C-to-5C conversion, we deconvoluted each time-dependent spectrum into a linear combination of the spectrum of the 6C NO-bound ferric species and that of the 5C species. Typical examples demonstrating the reliability of the deconvolution process are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. The resulting population of the 5C species is plotted as a function of time in Fig. 2a (inset), and the associated kinetic trace was best fit with a double exponential function with lifetimes of 21 and 287 min. A similar reaction was observed for iNOSoxy in the presence of l-Arg as shown in Fig. 2b. Although the kinetic lifetimes (23 and 396 min) were only slightly altered upon the addition of l-Arg, the relative amplitude of the slow phase increased from 49% in the absence of l-Arg to 67% in its presence. The conversion of the 6C NO-bound ferric derivative to the 5C species was inhibited by the binding of H4B, either with or without l-Arg (supplemental Fig. S2). On the basis of gel filtration analysis, Panda and co-workers (15Panda K. Rosenfeld R.J. Ghosh S. Meade A.L. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31020-31030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) have reported that, in the absence of H4B, iNOSoxy is in equilibrium between a monomeric form and a “loose” dimeric form and that l-Arg binding shifts the equilibrium toward the loose dimer, whereas H4B binding generates a tight dimer. Accordingly, we postulated that the production of the 5C species in the reaction shown in Fig. 2 was a consequence of the lack of strong dimeric interactions in the absence of H4B. We attribute the slow phase to the reaction of the loose dimer because the amplitude of the slow phase increased from 49 to 67% when l-Arg was added, and we attribute the fast phase to the reaction of the monomeric fraction of the iNOSoxy samples because it decreased correspondingly in the presence of l-Arg. To test this hypothesis, we examined the reaction between the monomeric form of iNOSoxy and NO using a urea-induced monomer as a model. It has been reported that 5 m urea induces 100% conversion of the dimeric enzyme into monomers, but it is accompanied by significant loss of the heme group because of denaturation; on the other hand, reducing the urea concentration to 3 m can induce only ∼94% of the dimer to convert to its monomeric form (15Panda K. Rosenfeld R.J. Ghosh S. Meade A.L. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31020-31030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To find the best conditions for generating the monomeric enzyme without denaturation, we titrated iNOSoxy with urea and found that 4 m urea was an optimum condition for generating the monomeric enzyme without heme loss (supplemental Fig. S3a). The monomeric state of the 4 m urea-treated iNOSoxy sample was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric measurements (data not shown) and by gel filtration analysis (supplemental Fig. S4). As shown in Fig. 3a, exposure of 4 m urea-treated iNOSoxy to NO instantaneously produced a 6C NO-bound ferric species with a Soret maximum at 439 nm, just as observed in the urea-free samples shown in Fig. 2; in addition, an analogous spectral transition from the 6C NO-bound ferric derivative to a 5C species was observed, although with altered kinetics. To gain quantitative information, the population of the 5C species was estimated by spectral deconvolution of the optical absorption data and was plotted as a function of reaction time in Fig. 3a (inset). The resulting kinetic trace was best fit with a single exponential function with a lifetime of ∼30 min. This lifetime is similar to that of the fast phase (21-23 min) obtained in the absence of urea (Fig. 2), consistent with the scenario that the fast phase originates from the monomeric enzyme. It should be noted that, in the gel filtration measurements in 4 m urea, a small amount of dimer was detected, but its elution volume was spread out compared with that in the absence of urea. We attribute it to some very loose dimer, which reacted with NO as rapidly as the monomer. To further confirm that the fast phase indeed originates from the monomeric derivative and to eliminate any possible side effects caused by the addition of urea, the NO reaction was examined using two iNOSoxy mutants (D92A and K82A) that adopt a pure monomeric conformation in the absence of H4B (25Ghosh D.K. Crane B.R. Ghosh S. Wolan D. Gachhui R. Crooks C. Presta A. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6260-6270Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fig. 3b shows the time-dependent optical absorption spectra of the D92A mutant of iNOSoxy following exposure to NO. Again, the instantaneously formed 6C NO-bound enzyme with a Soret band at 439 nm converted to the 5C species with a Soret maximum at 390 nm and a single exponential decay rate of ∼28 min, similar to that observed in the urea-stabilized monomeric wild-type enzyme sample. Similar kinetic behavior was observed with the K82A mutant (supplemental Fig. S3b), confirming that the 20-30-min kinetic phase originates from the monomeric form of the enzyme. On the basis of these data, we concluded that NO binding to the ferric protein in either the monomeric or dimeric state instantaneously produces a 6C NO-bound ferric derivative with indistinguishable optical absorption spectra with a Soret transition maximum at 439 nm. Subsequently, the fast phase is attributed to the transition from the 6C NO-bound state of the monomeric protein ([M-NO]6C) to the 5C species ([M]5C-NO), whereas the slow phase is ascribed to the same reaction originating from the loose dimer ([D-NO]6C) as described in Equation 1. [D-NO]6C→[M-NO]6C→[M]5C-NO(Eq. 1) Here, the formation of the 5C species is rate-limited by the monomerization of the dimer with an apparent lifetime of ∼300-400 min. To gain insights into the nature of the 5C species, the NO-treated samples were examined by resonance Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 4, the resonance Raman spectra of the 5C species with a Soret maximum at 390 nm generated in the presence and absence of urea are very similar (upper and middle traces), indicating that the two 5C species are the same. Because these spectra are virtually identical to those of 5C NO-bound ferrous derivatives of a variety of heme proteins as characterized by the heme modes located at 349, 677, and 756 cm-1 and a broad Fe-NO stretching mode (νFe-NO) in the 520-526 cm-1 region (26Deinum G.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4178-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the resonance Raman spectrum of the 5C NO-bound ferrous derivative of the iNOSoxy complex was also obtained (Fig. 4, lower trace). Here, the 5C NO-bound ferrous derivative was formed by directly adding NO to the substrate- and cofactor-free ferrous enzyme because the conversion of the 6C ferrous NO complex to its 5C form has been demonstrated previously in both iNOSoxy and neuronal NOSoxy by Stuehr and co-workers (31Abu-Soud H.M. Wu C. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3777-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 32Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1912-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The small differences in the 378 and 524 cm-1 regions are attributed to differences in the contributions of the laser plasma lines. The identical features in the three traces shown in Fig. 4 indicate that exposure of the ferric derivative of H4B-free iNOSoxy to NO leads to the reduction of the ferric heme iron to the ferrous form and the breakage of the proximal iron-thiolate bond. According to Equation 1, the dimer-to-monomer conversion occurs prior to the reduction to the 5C ferrous form. This is consistent with prior reports of monomerization induced by the presence of NO, although we cannot exclude the less likely possibility of a direct reduction of the enzyme to the ferrous form prior to dissociation of the dimer. To determine whether NO causes any chemical modifications of the polypeptide chain of iNOSoxy, we carried out mass spectrometric measurements of the NO-treated samples. All samples examined were first subjected to trypsin digestion prior to mass spectrometric analysis. The major modification in the mass spectra of the NO-treated samples versus the control sample without NO treatment was the enhancement of the three fragment ions at m/z 581.94, 640.27, and 743.85 as shown in Fig. 5. The charge states of the three fragments were determined to be +3, +3, and +2, respectively, on the basis of their characteristic isotopic distributions. The parent masses of the ion peaks at m/z 581.94 and 743.85 (1742.82 and 1485.70 Da, respectively) calculated based on the charges are exact matches with two expected trypsin cleavage products of iNOSoxy corresponding to peptide fragments 82-97 and 393-404, respectively. These assignments were confirmed by the tandem mass spectrometric data (data not shown). Intriguingly, all observed fragment ion peaks in the mass spectra can be accounted for by the expected trypsin cleavage products, except the triply charged ion at m/z 640.27 with a parent mass of 1917.81 Da. We found that this ion peak is an exact match of peptide fragments 98-105 and 108-117 disulfide bond-linked through Cys104 and Cys109. This assignment was confirmed by the tandem mass data shown in supplemental Fig. S5. To further verify the disulfide-bonded peptide fragments, the trypsin-digested fragments of the NO-treated sample (in the presence of 4 m urea) were reduced by dithiothreitol (to reduce the disulfide bond) and alkylated by iodoacetamide (to alkylate the reduced free cysteine residues). This treatment resulted in the appearance of a doubly charged ion at m/z 553.76, the parent mass (1105.5 Da) of which is an exact match for peptide fragment 108-117 with a carbamido-methylated cysteine residue, at the expense of the fragment ion peak at m/z 640.27 (supplemental Fig. S6). The modified fragment 98-105 was not observed, possibly because of its low ionization propensity. These data further confirmed the presence of the disulfide-linked peptide fragment 98-105/108-117. It is important to note that, other than a very small contribution from a Cys109-Cys109 disulfide-bonded fragment (data not shown), no other disulfide-linked trypsin-digested iNOSoxy fragments were observed; furthermore, no fragments were found to contain any NO-derivatized amino acids. This is in contrast to the results of NO treatment of nitrophorins, in which the proximal cysteine bond becomes ruptured and nitrosylated (33Weichsel A. Maes E.M. Andersen J.F. Valenzuela J.G. Shokhireva T. Walker F.A. Montfort W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 34Walker F.A. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 216-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Because the enzyme is in a monomeric state in the presence of 4 m urea, the formation of the disulfide-linked peptide fragment 98-105/108-117 must be a result of intramolecular rather than intermolecular interactions. Taken together, these data indicate that the NO-induced monomerization of the loose dimer is coupled to an intramolecular disulfide bond formation between cysteine residues at positions 104 and 109 and that the monomerization process exposes peptide fragments 82-97 and 393-404 to solvent, making them more accessible to trypsin digestion as reflected by the enhancement of the corresponding fragment ion peaks shown in Fig. 5. The data presented here clearly demonstrate that, in the absence of H4B, the ferric derivative of iNOSoxy is in equilibrium between a monomeric state and a loose dimeric state. Furthermore, l-Arg binding to the enzyme shifts the equilibrium toward the loose dimeric state, whereas the addition of H4B locks the enzyme in a tight dimeric state that resists NO-induced monomerization. The NO-induced monomerization in the loose dimer is associated with the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys104 and Cys109, located in the zinc-binding motif in the dimer interface. The resulting monomeric enzyme with a 6C NO-bound heme iron gradually converts to a 5C NO-bound ferrous species because of the reduction of the heme iron and the concomitant breakage of the proximal iron-thiolate bond. Autoreduction Mechanism—One possible mechanism to account for the conversion of the 6C NO-bound ferric derivative to the five-coordinate NO-bound ferrous form is a heterolytic cleavage of the proximal iron-thiolate bond: Cys--Fe3+-NO→Cys·+Fe2+-NO. To test this mechanism, we re-examined the NO reaction with 4 m urea-treated iNOSoxy as a function of the NO concentration. We found that the formation rate of the 5C species increased approximately linearly as the NO concentration increased (data not shown). Because the Sn1-type heterolytic cleavage reaction predicts an NO concentration-independent kinetic process, this mechanism is excluded. NO-mediated conversion of a 6C NO-bound ferric protein to a 6C NO-bound ferrous protein has been well documented for histidine-ligated heme proteins such as hemoglobin and myoglobin (35Chien J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1969; 91: 2166-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 36Addison A.W. Stephanos J.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4104-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (99"
https://openalex.org/W1981616338,"Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) is an enzyme involved in the base excision repair pathway. It specifically removes uracil from both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. The genome of the Bacillus subtilis phage ϕ29 is a linear double-stranded DNA with a terminal protein covalently linked at each 5′-end. Replication of ϕ29 DNA starts by a protein-priming mechanism and generates intermediates that have long stretches of single-stranded DNA. By using in vivo chemical cross-linking and affinity chromatography techniques, we found that UDG is a cellular target for the early viral protein p56. Addition of purified protein p56 to B. subtilis extracts inhibited the endogenous UDG activity. Moreover, extracts from ϕ29-infected cells were deficient in UDG activity. We suggested that inhibition of the cellular UDG is a defense mechanism developed by ϕ29 to prevent the action of the base excision repair pathway if uracil residues arise in their replicative intermediates. Protein p56 is the first example of a UDG inhibitor encoded by a non-uracil-containing viral DNA. Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) is an enzyme involved in the base excision repair pathway. It specifically removes uracil from both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. The genome of the Bacillus subtilis phage ϕ29 is a linear double-stranded DNA with a terminal protein covalently linked at each 5′-end. Replication of ϕ29 DNA starts by a protein-priming mechanism and generates intermediates that have long stretches of single-stranded DNA. By using in vivo chemical cross-linking and affinity chromatography techniques, we found that UDG is a cellular target for the early viral protein p56. Addition of purified protein p56 to B. subtilis extracts inhibited the endogenous UDG activity. Moreover, extracts from ϕ29-infected cells were deficient in UDG activity. We suggested that inhibition of the cellular UDG is a defense mechanism developed by ϕ29 to prevent the action of the base excision repair pathway if uracil residues arise in their replicative intermediates. Protein p56 is the first example of a UDG inhibitor encoded by a non-uracil-containing viral DNA. Uracil in DNA may arise from spontaneous deamination of cytosine and from the occasional use of dUTP instead of dTTP during DNA replication. Hydrolytic deamination of cytosine generates G:U mismatches that cause G:C to A:T transition mutations. To maintain the genome integrity, most prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells rapidly eliminate uracil from DNA by the base excision repair (BER) 2The abbreviations used are: BER, base excision repair; UDG, uracil-DNA glycosylase; AP, apurinic-apyrimidinic; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate); PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; TP, terminal protein; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; E2, dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase; E3, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase; cfu, colony-forming units.2The abbreviations used are: BER, base excision repair; UDG, uracil-DNA glycosylase; AP, apurinic-apyrimidinic; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate); PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; TP, terminal protein; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; E2, dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase; E3, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase; cfu, colony-forming units. pathway, which is initiated by the uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) enzyme. UDGs have an unusually broad phylogenetic distribution. Some DNA viruses, such as herpesviruses and poxviruses, also encode a UDG activity, whereas the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, packages cellular UDG (UNG2 enzyme) into virus particles. In these instances, the UDG activity appears to have an important role in virus replication (1Chen R. Wang H. Mansky L.M. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2339-2345Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The UDG enzyme hydrolyzes the N-glycosidic bond between the uracil residue and the deoxyribose sugar of the DNA backbone, generating an apurinic-apyrimidinic (AP) site. The first UDG activity reported was purified from Escherichia coli cells (2Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3649-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Since then, enzymes highly homologous to the archetypal E. coli UDG have been identified in numerous organisms, including human cells (Family-1 UDGs) (3Pearl L.H. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 165-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Studies on substrate specificity showed that Family-1 UDGs efficiently remove uracil residues from both single-stranded and double-stranded DNAs, often with preference for the single-stranded substrates (4Eftedal I. Guddal P.H. Slupphaug G. Volden G. Krokan H.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2095-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 5Panayotou G. Brown T. Barlow T. Pearl L.H. Savva R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 45-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The AP site generated by the UDG enzyme is further recognized by an AP endonuclease, which cleaves the phosphodiester bond of the DNA backbone 5′ to the AP site. Several AP endonucleases are active not only on double-stranded DNAs but also on single-stranded DNAs (6Shida T. Noda M. Sekiguchi J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4572-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 7Shida T. Ogawa T. Ogasawara N. Sekiguchi J. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 8Marenstein D.R. Wilson III, D.M. Teebor G.W. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Further repair can be accomplished via two pathways that involve different subsets of enzymes and result in replacement of one (short patch pathway) or more (long patch pathway) nucleotides (9Dianov G.L. Sleeth K.M. Dianova I.I. Allinson S.L. Mutat. Res. 2003; 531: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Over the course of evolution, bacteriophages have developed unique proteins that bind to and inactivate critical cellular proteins, shutting off key processes. The DNA genome of phage PBS2 contains uracil in place of thymine residues (10Takahashi I. Marmur J. Nature. 1963; 197: 794-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Following infection of Bacillus subtilis, this phage induces various enzymatic activities that ensure the use of dUTP rather than dTTP during viral DNA synthesis. In addition, phage PBS2 encodes an inhibitor of the B. subtilis UDG enzyme, named Ugi, which is essential for the preservation of uracil residues incorporated into phage DNA (11Friedberg E.C. Ganesan A.K. Minton K. J. Virol. 1975; 16: 315-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Cone R. Bonura T. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10354-10358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wang Z. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1163-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some studies showed that Ugi (84 amino acids) specifically inactivates Family-1 UDGs (13Wang Z. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1163-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Karran P. Cone R. Friedberg E.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6092-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structures of Ugi in complex with different UDGs revealed that Ugi mimics electronegative and structural features of duplex DNA (15Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Sanderson R.J. Slupphaug G. Kavli B. Krokan H.E. Mosbaugh D.W. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 701-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 16Savva R. Pearl L.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 752-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Putnam C.D. Shroyer M.J. Lundquist A.J. Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Mosbaugh D.W. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Unlike phage PBS2, the genome of the B. subtilis phage ϕ29 does not contain uracil residues. It is a linear double-stranded DNA, with a terminal protein (TP) covalently linked at both 5′-ends. Replication of ϕ29 DNA starts nonsimultaneously at either DNA end, where the replication origins are located, by a protein-priming mechanism (18Salas M. Genet. Eng. 1999; 21: 159-171Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy studies revealed two main types of ϕ29 replicative intermediates in infected cells, named type I and type II (19Inciarte M.R. Salas M. Sogo J.M. J. Virol. 1980; 34: 187-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Sogo J.M. García J.A. Peñalva M.A. Salas M. Virology. 1982; 116: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Type I intermediates are unit-length linear double-stranded DNA molecules with one or more single-stranded branches of varying lengths. Type II intermediates are unit-length linear molecules in which a region of the DNA starting from one end is double-stranded, and the adjacent region containing the other end is single-stranded. Thus, both replicative intermediates have long stretches of single-stranded DNA. Most unexpectedly, during the functional characterization of the early viral protein p56 (56 amino acids), we found that p56 interacted with the B. subtilis UDG and inhibited its activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that extracts from ϕ29-infected cells lacked UDG but not AP endonuclease activity. UDG inhibitors encoded by non-uracil containing viral DNAs were not identified previously. We propose that inhibition of the host UDG by protein p56 ensures the integrity of the ϕ29 replicative intermediates if uracil residues arise either by cytosine deamination or dUMP misincorporation. Bacterial Strains, Bacteriophages, and Plasmids—B. subtilis 110NA (23Moreno F. Camacho A. Viñuela E. Salas M. Virology. 1974; 62: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), a nonsuppressor (su–) strain, and B. subtilis MO-101-P (24Mellado R.P. Viñuela E. Salas M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), a suppressor strain (su+44), were used. Phage ϕ29 sus4 (56) (23Moreno F. Camacho A. Viñuela E. Salas M. Virology. 1974; 62: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was used in cross-linking experiments. This phage carries a suppressor-sensitive mutation in gene 4, which encodes an activator of the late transcription (25Rojo F. Mencía M. Monsalve M. Salas M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 60: 29-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Phage ϕ29 sus14(1242) (26Jiménez F. Camacho A. de la Torre J. Viñuela E. Salas M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 73: 57-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was used to measure UDG activity in extracts of infected cells. This phage contains a suppressor-sensitive mutation in gene 14, which encodes the holin protein (27Steiner M. Lubitz W. Blasi U. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, cell lysis is delayed. Phage stocks were prepared as reported (28Bravo A. Alonso J.C. Trautner T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2881-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To construct plasmid pCR2.1-TOPO.p56, the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) was used. Basically, a ϕ29 DNA region, which contains gene 56, was amplified by the PCR using the oligonucleotides 5′-CGCATTGTATGAGCTTTCTAGGATGG-3′ and 5′-GCAGGGAATTCTGCAGTCAAAGGACTTTATC-3′ as primers. The 267-bp PCR-synthesized fragment was cloned into the E. coli expression vector pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen), which is based on the T7 promoter. Transformed cultures of the E. coli TOP10 strain were plated on LB plates containing 50 μg/ml of kanamycin. To construct plasmid pPR53.p56, the 272-bp PstI restriction fragment of plasmid pCR2.1-TOPO.p56, which carries gene 56, was inserted into the PstI site of the B. subtilis constitutive expression vector pPR53, which is based on the PR promoter of phage λ (29Bravo A. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The B. subtilis strain YB886 (30Yasbin R.E. Fields P.I. Andersen B.J. Gene (Amst.). 1980; 12: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was used for cloning, and transformants were selected for phleomycin resistance (0.8 μg/ml). Gene 56 was engineered to encode a FLAG-tagged p56 protein (p56FLAG). To this end, a two-step mutagenesis method was used. In the first step, gene 56 was amplified by PCR using plasmid pPR53.p56 as template and the oligonucleotides A (5′-CCTCTAGAGTCGACCTGCAG-3′) and B (5′-GTCATCGTCATCCTTATAGTCAGGACTTTATCCAACCTTAG-3′) as primers. In the second step, the 298-bp PCR-synthesized fragment was used as template and the oligonucleotides A and C (5′-CCCTCAGGGCTGCAGTTATTACTTGTCATCGTCATCCTTATAGTC-3′) as primers. Oligonucleotides A and C include a PstI restriction site (boldface). The 322-bp PCR-amplified fragment was further digested with PstI, and the 293-bp digestion product was inserted into the PstI site of the B. subtilis vector pPR53 (plasmid pPR53.p56FLAG). Phage Growth under One-step Conditions—B. subtilis 110NA cells were exponentially grown at 30 °C in LB medium supplemented with 5 mm MgSO4 to an absorbance at 560 nm (A560) equivalent to ∼108 colony-forming units (cfu) per ml. The culture was then infected with ϕ29 at a multiplicity of 5–10. After 10 min of incubation with gentle shaking, unadsorbed phages were eliminated by centrifugation of the infected culture. Cells were resuspended in the same volume of medium and incubated with vigorous shaking for the indicated time. Immunoblotting—Gel-separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) using a Mini Trans Blot (Bio-Rad) at 100 mA and 4 °C for 60 min. Transfer buffer contained 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol. Membranes were probed with anti-p56 serum for 60 min. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). For quantitative immunoblotting (29Bravo A. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), cell extracts were prepared from a known number of viable cells, which was determined before phage addition. Increasing amounts of the cell extract and known amounts of purified protein p56 were run in the same gel. In Vivo Chemical Cross-linking—Bacteria were washed with 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, and concentrated 20-fold in buffer P (50 mm Hepes, 10 mm EDTA, 20% sucrose, pH 8.0). The cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP) (Pierce) was dissolved in Me2SO just before use. DSP was added to the culture at the indicated concentration. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was added at a final concentration of 150 mm to quench the reaction. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in loading buffer without β-mercaptoethanol (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 30% glycerol), and disrupted by sonication. Isolation of p56FLAG Complexes—B. subtilis 110NA cells carrying plasmid pPR53.p56FLAG were exponentially grown in LB medium containing phleomycin (0.8 μg/ml) at 30 °C to an A560 equivalent to ∼108 cfu/ml. Cells were concentrated 10-fold in buffer TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and disrupted by French pressure treatment (20,000 p.s.i.). The whole-cell extract was centrifuged at 7,000 rpm and 4 °C in a Sorvall SS.34 rotor for 10 min. The supernatant was loaded onto an anti-FLAG M2 affinity column (Sigma) under gravity flow. Later, the column was extensively washed with buffer TBS. Proteins bound to the column were eluted with buffer TBS containing FLAG-peptide (500 μg/ml) (Sigma). Eluted proteins were precipitated with acetone and resuspended in loading buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 30% glycerol). Peptide Mass Fingerprinting—Gel-separated proteins were stained with SyproRuby and subjected to in situ digestion with trypsin, as described (31Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7807) Google Scholar). Peptide masses were measured with a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometer Autoflex (Bruker Daltonic; Bremen, Germany) equipped with a reflector and employing 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as matrix and a Anchor-Chip surface target. The mass spectra were fitted to data bases by the program Mascot (32Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6763) Google Scholar). Purification of Protein p56—E. coli BL21(DE3) cells carrying plasmid pCR2.1-TOPO.p56 were grown in LB medium containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) at 34 °C. When the culture reached an A560 of 0.9, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After 30 min, cells were incubated with rifampicin (120 μg/ml) for 75 min. Cells were collected by centrifugation and frozen at –70 °C before being used. Protein p56 was purified under ice-cold conditions using the following protocol. Cells were ground with alumina in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol) containing 0.65 m NaCl. After removal of alumina and cell debris by centrifugation, the cleared lysate was mixed with polyethyleneimine (0.3%), incubated on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm in a Sorvall GSA rotor for 10 min. The supernatant was made 0.3 m NaCl with buffer A and centrifuged as before for 20 min. The resulting pellet was washed with buffer A containing 0.7 m NaCl. After centrifugation (12,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor for 20 min), the supernatant was processed by stepwise ammonium sulfate precipitation at 65, 45, and finally 30%. Proteins were recovered from the 30% ammonium sulfate supernatant by raising it to 50% ammonium sulfate. This last pellet was resuspended in buffer A to a final salt concentration of 55 mm (estimated by conductivity measurements). The protein preparation was then loaded onto a Mono Q column equilibrated with buffer A containing 55 mm NaCl. Protein p56 was eluted from the column with 0.3 m NaCl. This fraction was further loaded onto a 15–30% glycerol gradient and subjected to centrifugation at 62,000 rpm in a Beckman SW.65 rotor for 20 h. Fractions containing p56 were pooled, precipitated with ammonium sulfate to 70% saturation, resuspended in buffer A containing 50% glycerol, and stored at –70 °C. Interaction between p56 and E. coli UDG in Vitro—The reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 2 μg of protein p56, and 0.2 μgof E. coli UDG (New England Biolabs). After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the sample was kept at 4 °C for 15 min and analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE (16% polyacrylamide). Gel electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C. UDG and AP Endonuclease Activities in B. subtilis Extracts—B. subtilis strain 110NA was grown to mid-log phase in LB medium at 30 °C (∼108 cfu/ml). Cells were concentrated 10-fold in buffer U (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 12 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet of Complete, Mini, EDTA-free per 10 ml) from Roche Applied Science. Cells were disrupted by French pressure treatment (20,000 p.s.i.). After centrifugation at 7,000 rpm and 4 °C in a Sorvall SS.34 rotor for 10 min, the supernatant (extract) was kept at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks. Total protein concentration (1.35 mg/ml) was determined by the Lowry method using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. To measure UDG activity, a 34-mer oligonucleotide containing a single uracil residue at position 16 (ssDNA-U16) (from Isogen) was used as substrate. It was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained the indicated amount of extract and radiolabeled substrate in buffer U carrying protease inhibitors (see above). After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, samples were treated with NaOH to a final concentration of 0.2 m and heated at 90 °C for 30 min. Samples were then dried in a SpeedVac, resuspended in 10 μl of formamide loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue), and subjected to electrophoresis in 8 m urea, 20% polyacrylamide gels. To measure AP endonuclease activity, the radiolabeled ssDNA-U16 oligonucleotide was incubated with E. coli UDG (New England Biolabs), generating a 34-mer oligonucleotide with an AP site at position 16 (ssDNA-AP16). This product was used as substrate. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 12 mm NaCl, 12 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, and the indicated amount of extract and radiolabeled substrate. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, 12 μlofthe formamide loading buffer was added to the reactions. Purified human AP endonuclease (APE1) was purchased from Trevigen. Protein p56 Accumulates throughout the ϕ29-Infective Cycle—The left end of the ϕ29 genome contains genes 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 (Fig. 1B). With the exception of gene 4, which encodes a transcriptional regulator protein, the mentioned genes are involved in phage DNA replication (18Salas M. Genet. Eng. 1999; 21: 159-171Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 33Bravo A. Serrano-Heras G. Salas M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 25-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Analysis of the nucleotide sequence downstream gene 1 revealed the existence of an open reading frame (ORF56) that would encode an acidic protein of 56 amino acids (protein p56). ORF56 would be mainly transcribed from two strong early promoters, named A2c and A2b, into a polycistronic RNA (Fig. 1B). Both promoters are partially repressed at late times of infection (25Rojo F. Mencía M. Monsalve M. Salas M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 60: 29-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, ORF56 would be transcribed from the weak early promoter A1IV, which is located within gene 2 (34Sogo J.M. Lozano M. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 1943-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 35Barthelemy I. Salas M. Mellado R.P. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 874-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Bravo A. Illana B. Salas M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5575-5584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze whether protein p56 was synthesized during ϕ29 infection, B. subtilis cells were infected with phage ϕ29 under one-step growth conditions. At different times after infection, whole-cell extracts were obtained by sonication, and total proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. A protein recognized by antibodies against p56 accumulated throughout the ϕ29 lytic cycle (Fig. 2A). Overexposure of the blot shown in Fig. 2A allowed detection of p56 at 15 min of ϕ29 infection (not shown). Quantitative immunoblotting indicated that protein p56 was present in ∼104 molecules per cell at early stages of infection (15 min), and it increased up to ∼105 molecules per cell at late stages of infection (50 min). Protein p56 Interacts with a Host Protein during ϕ29 Infection—To find out whether protein p56 interacted with a viral and/or cellular protein during ϕ29 infection, we carried out in vivo chemical cross-linking experiments. Specifically, at 40 min of viral infection, cells were incubated with dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP). This homobi-functional cross-linker reacts significantly with the ϵ-amine of lysine residues. Protein p56 has four lysines. Following this treatment, whole-cell extracts were prepared by sonication. Total proteins were separated by SDS-Tricine-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against p56. As control, noninfected cells were incubated with DSP (Fig. 2B). The anti-p56 antibodies cross-reacted with a bacterial protein that migrated at ∼20 kDa (Fig. 2B, protein X). In infected cells treated with DSP, in addition to protein p56, a major specific cross-linked product migrating at ∼35 kDa (p56 complex) was detected. We further investigated whether the p56 complex was formed in the absence of other viral proteins. To this end, gene 56 was cloned into the B. subtilis expression vector pPR53 (29Bravo A. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells carrying the recombinant plasmid (pPR53.p56) constitutively synthesized protein p56 at levels slightly lower than those detected at 40 min of phage infection (Fig. 2B). When these cells were incubated with DSP, the ∼35-kDa p56 complex was again detected. Hence, the viral protein p56 was able to interact with a host protein both during the infective process and in the absence of viral components. Taking into account the molecular mass of p56 (6.6 kDa) and DSP (0.4 kDa), the molecular mass of the host protein would be ∼28 kDa. Protein p56 Interacts with UDG—To identify the cell target for protein p56, gene 56 was engineered to encode a FLAG-tagged p56 protein (p56FLAG). This variant of p56 carries the peptide DYKDDDDK fused to its C-terminal end. The mutant gene was cloned into the B. subtilis expression vector pPR53 (plasmid pPR53.p56FLAG). By immunoblotting, we verified that B. subtilis cells carrying the recombinant plasmid constitutively synthesized protein p56FLAG at levels similar to those detected for p56 at late stages of ϕ29 infection (not shown). Extracts from these cells were applied to an anti-FLAG affinity column. The pure FLAG peptide was then used to elute p56FLAG. As a negative control, extracts from B. subtilis cells harboring plasmid pPR53 were used. The eluted proteins were separated by SDS-Tricine-PAGE and stained with SyproRuby (Fig. 3A). Protein p56FLAG co-eluted with five proteins (named A to E) that were absent in the control sample. With the exception of protein E, such proteins were identified by peptide mass finger-printing using the MASCOT search program (32Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6763) Google Scholar). Proteins A and B were identified as the E2 (47.5 kDa; dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase) and E3 (49.7 kDa; dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase) subunits of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (PDH), respectively. Their mobility in denaturing polyacrylamide gels was anomalous, as reported previously (39Gao H. Jiang X. Pogliano K. Aronson A.I. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2780-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Protein C was a degradation product of the PDH E2 subunit (E2*), whereas protein D was identified as the UDG DNA repair enzyme (26 kDa). Therefore, the affinity chromatography results suggested that protein p56 interacted with a subunit of the PDH complex (see “Discussion”) and with UDG. Because the in vivo chemical cross-linking experiments (Fig. 2B) revealed that a protein of ∼28 kDa was a cell target for p56, we performed additional experiments to confirm the potential interaction between p56 and UDG (see below). The B. subtilis UDG is highly homologous to the E. coli UDG (Family-1 UDGs) (3Pearl L.H. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 165-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 40Glaser P. Kunst F. Arnaud M.

To this end, protein p56 was incubated with E. coli UDG for 15 min at room temperature, and the reaction mixture was analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE. As shown in Fig. 3B, free protein p56, but not free UDG, was detected. Moreover, a protein band migrating faster than UDG was visualized (p56-UDG-coli). This band contained p56 and UDG, as confirmed by immunoblot analysis and peptide mass fingerprinting, respectively (not shown). In conjunction with the above, this result demonstrated that protein p56 forms a complex with UDG. Protein p56 Functions as an Inhibitor of the B. subtilis UDG—Family-1 UDGs are able to excise uracil base efficiently from both single-stranded and double-stranded DNAs. Furthermore, they are specifically sensitive to Ugi (3Pearl L.H. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 165-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), a UDG inhibitor encoded by phage PBS2. Removal of uracil by UDGs generates an AP site that can be processed by hydrolytic AP endonucleases. In the absence of an AP endonuclease activity, chemical cleavage of the DNA at the AP site can be achieved by treatment with heat and alkali. To investigate whether protein p56 was an inhibitor of the B. subtilis UDG, we set up an assay to measure UDG activity in B. subtilis extracts. In the first experiment, a 34-mer single-stranded oligonucleotide containing a single uracil residue at position 16 (ssDNA-U16) was incubated with increasing amounts of a B. subtilis extract. After 10 min, NaOH was added to the reaction mixtures. As shown in Fig. 4A, a cleavage product was generated using 0.2 μg of extract. Moreover, the substrate was almost totally cleaved when 1.6 μg of extract were used. The same cleavage product was detected when the substrate was incubated with UDG purified from E. coli. Therefore, the B. subtilis extract was capable of removing uracil from single-stranded DNA generating an AP site (UDG activity). However, under the assayed conditions, the extract lacked AP endonuclease activity, because cleavage of the substrate did not occur when the reactions were not treated with NaOH (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the UDG activity of the B. subtilis extract was sensitive to the presence of Ugi (Fig. 4B) and was able to excise uracil from double-stranded DNA bearing a G:U mismatch (not shown). Collectively, these results demonstrated the presence of Family-1 UDG in the B. subtilis extract. We next examined whether the viral protein p56 was able to inhibit the UDG activity of the B. subtilis extract (Fig. 4C). To this end, the"

In crystal structures of HIV-1 RT complexed with DNA-DNA template-primer, the palm subdomain in the template cleft contacts the template backbone near the proposed site of slippage via the Glu89 side chain. We investigated the role of Glu89 in frameshifting by perturbing this interaction. Substitutions with Asp, Gly, Ala, Val, Ser, Thr, Asn, or Lys were created in recombinant HIV RT, and frameshift frequencies of the resulting mutant RTs were measured. All substitutions led to reduced -1 frameshifting by HIV-1 RT (2-40-fold). Interestingly, the suppression of -1 frameshifting frequently coincided with an enhancement of +1 frameshifting (3-47-fold) suggesting that Glu89 can influence the slippage of both strands. Glu89 substitutions also led to reduced rates of dNTP misincorporation that paralleled reductions in -1 frameshifting, suggesting a common structural mechanism for both classes of RT error. Our results reveal a major influence of Glu89 on slippage-mediated errors and dNTP incorporation fidelity. The crystal structure of HIV-1 RT reveals a salt bridge between Glu89 and Lys154, which may facilitate -1 frameshifting; this concept is supported by the observed reduction in -1 frameshifting for K154A and K154R mutants.

The relative error proneness of HIV-1 RT is recognized as one of the factors responsible for high genetic variation in HIV, which ultimately leads to the rapid emergence of drug-resistant HIV variants. The broad structural basis of HIV-1 RT fidelity is reasonably well understood. The first structural insights into HIV-1 RT fidelity came from biochemical studies on nucleoside analog RT inhibitor-resistant mutants, in which the residues affected tend to be located at or near the polymerase active site. For example, it was shown that the (-)-2′-deoxy-3′-thiacytidine-resistance mutation M184V, affecting a residue located near the incoming dNTP, conferred an increased fidelity of dNTP incorporation on HIV-1 RT (4Oude Essink B.B. Back N.K. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3212-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 5Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Rege N. Sarafianos S.G. Yadav P.N. Modak M.J.

Prasad V.R. Science. 1996; 271: 1282-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The first crystal structure of HIV-1 RT complexed with double-stranded DNA template-primer showed specific structural elements termed primer grip and template grip, which correctly position the templating base and the primer 3′ terminus for the insertion of incoming dNTP (Fig. 1) (7Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). The structure of HIV-1 RT complexed with template-primer and dNTP showed that the β3-β4 hairpin of the fingers subdomain provides key contacts for the templating nucleotide and the incoming dNTP (8Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). The importance of this region for dNTP selection and fidelity is further supported by reports of several mutations in the β3-β4 hairpin that affect RT fidelity (9Shah F. Curr K. Parniak M. Mitsuya H.

Whereas residues proximal to the dNTP-binding pocket can directly influence polymerase fidelity, the contribution of residues that contact template-primer duplex to fidelity is presumably indirect. Such residues primarily influence processes related to template-primer interaction such as the RT-template-primer affinity, polymerase translocation along the template during synthesis, and processivity (13Beard W.A.

For example, two well studied structural elements, αH of the thumb subdomain and the template grip β5a in the palm subdomain of HIV-1 RT, which are known to affect polymerase processivity (15Quan Y.

The E89G variant in β5a of the template grip increases dNTP incorporation fidelity of HIV-1 RT (17Drosopoulos W.C. Prasad V.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4834-4838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glu89 is of particular interest because of its unique location in the RT template grip (see below) and its established importance in HIV-1 replication and drug resistance. The E89G variant was first identified in an in vitro phenotypic screen of a random library of RT mutations (19Prasad V.R. Goff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16689-16693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Prasad V.R. Lowy I. de los Santos T. Chiang L. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11363-11367Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). HIV-1 virions containing the E89G mutation are replication competent and exhibit multidideoxynucleoside analog resistance (20Prasad V.R. Lowy I. de los Santos T. Chiang L. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11363-11367Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although the E89G mutation is rarely observed alone in natural settings, it has been observed in association with M184V in (-)-2′-deoxy-3′-thiacytidine-resistant isolates from HIV-infected individuals (21Gao Q. Gu Z. Parniak M.A. Cameron J. Cammack N. Boucher C. Wainberg M.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 1390-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In the context of SIV replication in monkeys, the E89G mutation rendered the virus less fit forcing it to acquire secondary mutations (22Newstein M.C. Desrosiers R.C. J. Infect. Dis. 2001; 184: 1262-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Mansky and colleagues (23Mansky L.M. Le Rouzic E. Benichou S. Gajary L.C. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2071-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) measured the mutation rate of HIV-1 containing the E89G mutation in a single-cycle replication assay and found that it led to a small reduction (20%) in mutation rate (23Mansky L.M. Le Rouzic E. Benichou S. Gajary L.C. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2071-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of mutation patterns in vitro suggests that the reduction in one type of RT error is compensated for by an increase in other types of errors (24Drosopoulos W.C. Prasad V.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4224-4230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structures of HIV-1 RT complexed with the double-stranded DNA show Glu89 to be a key anchor residue in the β5a template grip (7Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 8Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Glu89 is in close proximity to the sugar-phosphate backbone of the template strand near the penultimate base pair. Thus, substitution at Glu89 may affect polymerase fidelity by changing the conformation of the template-primer duplex, thereby altering the geometry of the dNTP-binding site (25Boyer P.L. Tantillo C. Jacobo-Molina A. Nanni R.G. Ding J. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4882-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Additionally, it is also possible that Glu89 substitutions affect the positioning of the template-primer rather than its conformation. A high frequency of single-base deletion errors, or -1 frameshift errors, is a hallmark of mutations by HIV-1 RT. This type of error occurs at rates 90-fold higher in homopolymeric runs of nucleotides than at non-runs (26Bebenek K. Abbotts J. Roberts J.D. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16948-16956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HIV-1 RT also generates +1 frameshifting at nucleotide runs, although at a ∼5-fold lower frequency than -1 frameshifting (26Bebenek K. Abbotts J. Roberts J.D. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16948-16956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The -1 frameshifting is thought to be mediated by template slippage events, whereas the +1 frameshifting is caused by primer strand slippage during polymerization (27Streisinger G. Okada Y. Emrich J. Newton J. Tsugita A. Terzaghi E. Inouye M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1966; 31: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). The location of Glu89 is approximately where template slippage might occur, suggesting a role for the Glu89 in (-1) frameshifting. In addition, of the 5-6 residues in the β5a strand, only the Glu89 side chain is in close proximity to template strand. Considering its biological importance in drug resistance (20Prasad V.R. Lowy I. de los Santos T. Chiang L. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11363-11367Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Gao Q. Gu Z. Parniak M.A. Cameron J. Cammack N. Boucher C. Wainberg M.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 1390-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), we wished to study the effect of altering this interaction between template grip and template-primer on slippage-mediated events. Employing the previously reported Glu89 mutants (28Song Q. Yang G. Goff S.P. Prasad V.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7568-7571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the influence of limited vertical scanning mutagenesis of Glu89 on the frequency of frameshifting by HIV-1 RT. We show here that all eight substitutions of Glu89 tested display decreased frequencies of -1 frameshifting. Unexpectedly, the decrease in -1 frameshifting was also accompanied by increased frequencies of +1 frameshifting. Crystal structures of HIV-1 RT complexed with duplex DNA show contacts between Lys154 and Glu89, thus predicting a possible role for Lys154 in -1 frameshifting. By using site-directed mutants of Lys154 to measure -1 frameshifting, we confirm this prediction. Furthermore, substitutions at Glu89 increased the fidelity of dNTP incorporation showing the influence of Glu89 on multiple types of replication errors. Enzymes, dNTPs, and Oligonucleotides—HIV-1 RT is a heterodimer of p66 and p51 subunits. RT mutants were prepared by introducing the mutation in the catalytic subunit, p66. The mutant p66 RTs were expressed from the expression plasmid pRT and reconstituted with the wild-type RT p51 expressed from p6HRT51, followed by purification as described before (29Kew Y. Qingbin S. Prasad V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15331-15336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified RTs were found to be free of DNase activity even after incubation of excess RT with radiolabeled DNA substrate for up to 8 h. Purification of K154A, K154R, and P157S mutants was as described previously (30Klarmann G.J. Smith R.A. Schinazi R.F. North T.W. Preston B.D. J. Biol.

The M13mp2 DNA used as a substrate for the assay contained a single-base (T) insertion in the run of Thr at position 70 of lacZα for scoring -1 frameshifts (5T-1 substrate) and a single-base deletion for scoring +1 frameshifts (7T+1 substrate) (32Kroutil L.C. Register K. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1046-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Both M13mp2-gapped DNA substrates were generous gifts of T. A. Kunkel (National Institutes of Health, NIEHS, Research Triangle Park, NC). M13-gapped DNA substrates were filled in by wild-type and mutant RTs as described previously (26Bebenek K. Abbotts J. Roberts J.D. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16948-16956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complete filling in was ensured by agarose gel electrophoresis and the successfully filled-in gapped duplex DNA was electroporated into Escherichia coli strain MC1061. Electroporations were performed on separate days for each of three trials for each DNA synthesis reaction. Cells were allowed to recover for 10 min, then mixed with E. coli CSH50 cells (Δ(pro-lac), thi, ara, strA/F′(proAB, lacIqZ_M15, traD36) in the presence of 0.25 mm isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside (LabScientific) and soft agar containing 0.2 mm X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside; LabScientific), and plated on M9 plates. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 15 h and the plaques were screened for β-galactosidase activity by looking for those displaying the dark blue reversion phenotype. Such revertant plaques were picked for sequencing and stored in 1 ml of 0.9% saline at 4 °C. Reversion frequencies were determined by dividing the number of revertants by the total number of plaques screened. All reversion frequencies were corrected for background reversion frequency of the substrates (1.30 × 10-5 for the 5T-1 substrate and 8.3 × 10-5 for the 7T+1 substrate (32Kroutil L.C. Register K. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1046-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar)). The isolation of single-stranded DNA from revertant plaques and the determination of nucleotide sequences were as described previously (33Rezende L.F. Drosopoulos W.C. Prasad V.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3066-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The forward mutation frequencies were determined using a wild-type lacZα-gapped duplex DNA as described previously (24Drosopoulos W.C. Prasad V.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4224-4230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Single dNTP Exclusion Assay—The “single dNTP exclusion” or the “minus dNTP” assay were performed on DNA-DNA template (55-mer) and primer (28-mer) oligonucleotides (Table 1). A 5′-32P-labeled primer oligonucleotide was extended by purified wild-type or the eight Glu89 mutant RTs in the presence of all four combinations of three dNTPs. The DNA template-primers were prepared by annealing the template (at a molar ratio of 2 template to 1 primer) to the end-labeled primer. Reactions were initiated by combining equal volumes (10 μl) of enzyme-template-primer solution and dNTP salt solution in which all four dNTPs were present, or in which one of the dNTPs was omitted. Each RT was used at two different concentrations (1× and 2.5×). The 1× concentrations for wild-type, E89A, and E89V were, respectively, 0.68, 0.09, and 0.18 nm. Enzyme concentrations for wild-type and mutant RTs were selected to be at equal levels of DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities on the template-primer used here. Thus, the 1× concentration for each enzyme is different in terms of protein input or unit activity as measured on poly(rA)·oligo(dT) template-primer, but similar with respect to their enzyme activity on the DNA-DNA template-primer used. After mixing, reactions contained 100 nm template-primer, increasing concentrations of wild-type, and mutant RTs as described above, 250 μm dNTPs, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 60 mm NaCl, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% IGEPAL (surfactant), and 10 mm MgCl2. The reactions were terminated after 6 min by the addition of 20 μl of stop solution (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA). Eight microliters of boiled reaction mixture were subjected to electrophoresis in a 10% urea polyacrylamide gel for 2.5 h at 100 W. Autoradiograms were analyzed by densitometry, and band intensities were quantitated via ImageQuant. Total band intensity was calculated as the total intensity of the band immediately below the barrier site plus all the bands above it. Extension was calculated as the sum of all bands at and above the barrier site. Percentage extension as a fraction of the total band intensity was then calculated from total band intensity and extension. Mispair Extension Reactions—Primer extension reactions were performed using four different 5′-32P-labeled DNA 31-mers (G:C, G:T, G:G, G:A; see Table 1) annealed to a 55-mer DNA template using wild-type and mutant RTs. As before, two different concentrations of each RT (selected to be equal in DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity between different enzymes as tested on a DNA-DNA template-primer) were tested for each enzyme at 1× and 2.5× concentrations. The 1× concentrations used for the wild-type, E89A, E89V, E89D, and E89G were 0.68, 0.12, 0.18, 0.09, and 2.3 nm, respectively. Reactions and buffer conditions were as described above for the dNTP exclusion assay, but in the presence of dGTP, dATP, and dTTP, each at 25 μm. Reactions were terminated after 10 min and analyzed as previously described for dNTP exclusion assay. Single-base Deletion Errors—Glu89 of the β5a strand in the palm subdomain of HIV RT is located near the site of template strand slippage. Thus, it is well positioned to either directly or indirectly influence -1 frameshifting. To investigate whether the presumptive interaction between the template grip Glu89 and the template strand influences frameshift mutagenesis by HIV-1 RT, we perturbed this interaction by substituting Glu89 with Asp, Gly, Ala, Val, Ser, Thr, Asn, or Lys. We then determined the frequency at which polymerizing mutant RTs lead to -1 frameshifting, using an M13-based reversion assay that employs a lacZα variant as a reporter gene (26Bebenek K. Abbotts J. Roberts J.D. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16948-16956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay, deletion of a base in a run of 5 thymidines causes reversion to the wild-type phenotype (dark blue plaques). Interestingly, all substitutions at Glu89 led to a decrease in the frequency of the -1 frameshift errors by HIV-1 RT (Table 2). Substitutions to Val, Lys, and Thr resulted in the greatest decreases (40-, 28- and 8-fold, respectively) in -1 frameshift frequency. Other substitutions (Asp, Gly, Ala, Ser, and Asn) led to smaller effects, ranging from 2- to 5-fold reduction from the wild-type frequency. It is possible that revertants can also result from +2 events because of primer slippage, which can also restore the reading frame. However, sequencing a sampling of 12 revertants from each of the 9 reactions revealed only -1 events. These results suggest that wild-type Glu89 leads to one of the highest rates of single-base deletion mutations, whereas all substitutions tested lead to reductions.TABLE 2Frequencies of frameshift errors by HIV-1 RT Glu89 mutants on lacZα template The frequencies of - 1 or + 1 mutation by WT, E89D, E89G, E89A, E89V, E89S, E89T, E89N, or E89K reverse transcriptases were measured in three separate trials, and the mean frequency and S.D. are shown after subtracting the background frequency (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). -Fold increases in - 1 frameshift frequency and -fold decreases in + 1 frameshift frequency versus wild-type RT are shown.Enzyme-1 Frameshifting+1 FrameshiftingRatioaRatio of - 1 frameshifting to + 1 frameshiftingPlaques screenedFrameshifting frequencybRepresents the mean of three independent determinations × 10-5-Fold decrease from WTPlaques screenedFrameshifting frequencybRepresents the mean of three independent determinations × 10-5-Fold increase from WTWT437,000225 ± 171.088,00039 ± 211.05.8E89D378,00041 ± 215.556,000148 ± 263.80.3E89G419,00049 ± 224.666,200230 ± 195.90.2E89A479,00067 ± 84.040,000155 ± 163.40.4E89V277,0005.6 ± 440.031,00038 ± 91.00.15E89S446,00076 ± 143.065,0001846 ± 11447.00.04E89T430,00029 ± 107.858,000494 ± 4012.70.06E89N318,00092 ± 22.561,0001464 ± 2637.50.06E89K687,0008 ± 228.052,000100 ± 112.60.08a Ratio of - 1 frameshifting to + 1 frameshiftingb Represents the mean of three independent determinations Open table in a new tab Single-base Insertion Errors—Although HIV-1 RT can also produce +1 frameshifts, which are mediated by the primer slippage events, the residue Glu89 does not contact the primer, which is located on the other side of the point of Glu89 contact with template-primer duplex. Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether Glu89 would have any influence on primer slippage events. We measured the +1 frameshifting frequency of Glu89-substituted RT mutants using a different M13 substrate reporter gene, which contained a single-base deletion in lacZα such that the insertion of a base within a run of 7 Ts results in the reversion phenotype. Although both +1 and -2 (deletion of 2 bases via template slippage) mutations could restore a functional lacZα gene, previous analysis of a large number of clones has revealed no -2 mutations in this construct. 6T. A. Kunkel, personal communication. In contrast to the results obtained for -1 frameshift frequency measurements, all Glu89 substitutions (except the Glu to Val substitution) led to an increase in the frequency of +1 frameshift errors (Table 2). The wild-type +1 frameshift frequency was about five times lower than the -1 frameshift frequency. The substitutions led to a 2.6-47-fold increase in +1 frameshift frequency over that of wild-type (Table 2). Thus, the majority of frameshift mutations by wild-type RT were of the -1 type, whereas the majority of frameshift mutations by all of the variant RTs were of the +1 type. Some of the substitutions, such as Ser, Thr, and Asn caused increases in total frameshifting (7-, 2-, and 6-fold, respectively) while maintaining the inverse ratio of +1 to -1 frameshifting compared with wild-type RT (Table 1). Base Substitution Fidelity—It was surprising that the wild-type enzyme displayed the highest -1 frameshift mutation frequency, as one would expect the wild-type enzyme to have minimal slippage-mediated mutations, which have little evolutionary benefit for protein coding sequences. Therefore, we investigated the influence of wild-type Glu89 on base substitution fidelity. Base substitution errors (or misincorporation) result from two events during polymerization. First the insertion of an incorrectly paired dNTP (misinsertion) must occur. Such events result in a mispaired primer terminus and are generally not preferred by most DNA polymerases. For the misinserted base to become a misincorporated base, the mispaired primer terminus must be extended by correct insertion of a base opposite the next template base (mispair extension). To investigate the effect of Glu89 on both misinsertion and mispair extension, we utilized a gel-based single dNTP exclusion assay or minus dNTP assay (1Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J. Loeb L.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), which provides a gross estimate of the efficiency of base substitution for a polymerase without proofreading function. This assay involves copying a heteropolymeric DNA template using a 5′-end-labeled primer in the presence of only 3 dNTPs (absence of a single dNTP). Primer extension past a template site for which the complementary dNTP is missing depends on the ability of the polymerase to misinsert dNTPs as well as to extend the mispaired primer. Thus the extent of primer extension under these conditions allows a gross estimate of the ability of the polymerase to generate misincorporations (the combined result of both misinsertion and mispair extension events). The assay was set up as described before (34Fisher T.S. Prasad V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22345-22352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A 22-nucleotide 5′-end-labeled DNA primer was annealed to a 55-nucleotide oligonucleotide DNA. Absence of one dNTP in the reactions creates a barrier to primer extension at the template position where RT would need to incorporate the missing dNTP. For polymerases (e.g. RT), which lack exonucleolytic proofreading activity, one can obtain an estimate of efficiency of misincorporation, a combined sum of changes in the misinsertion and mispair extension efficiencies, by measuring the amounts of products extended past the barrier. For the results of this assay to be meaningful, it was critical that the enzyme inputs in terms of activity levels be nearly identical in all reactions. To this end, we ensured"

We have previously demonstrated that the initial step of acylation of the precursor glycerol 3-phosphate is not essential for the synthesis of ester and ether phospholipids in this parasite. Here we show that Leishmania expresses a single acyltransferase with high specificity for the precursor dihydroxyacetone phosphate and shows the best activity in the presence of palmitoyl-CoA. We have identified and characterized the LmDAT gene encoding this activity. LmDAT complements the lethality resulting from the loss of both dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activities in yeast. Recombinant LmDAT exhibits biochemical properties similar to those of the native enzyme of the promastigote stage parasites. We show that LmDAT is a glycosomal enzyme and its loss in a Δlmdat/Δlmdat null mutant results in complete abrogation of the parasite dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase activity. Furthermore, lack of LmDAT causes a major alteration in parasite division during the logarithmic phase of growth, an accelerated cell death during stationary phase, and loss of virulence. Together, our results demonstrate that LmDAT is the only dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase of the L. major localized in the peroxisome, important for growth and survival and essential for virulence.

Worldwide, protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania cause a large spectrum of important human diseases collectively named leishmaniasis. These parasites develop within the digestive tract of the sand fly vector as flagellated, mobile promastigotes and differentiate into and multiply as non-motile amastigotes within the phagolysosomal compartment of vertebrate host macrophages.Glycerolipids constitute 70% of total lipids in the protozoan parasite Leishmania (1Wassef M.K. Fioretti T.B. Dwyer D.M. Lipids. 1985; 20: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 2Beach D.H. Holz Jr., G.G. Anekwe G.E. J.

They are classified into ester and ether lipids depending on the substitution at position 1 of the glycerol backbone. Ester lipids harbor an acyl group, whereas ether lipids carry a fatty alcohol moiety. Lipids of Leishmania parasites have been a focus of extensive studies because some of their derivatives, such as lipophosphoglycan and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protease gp63, were shown to be important for parasite virulence and development (for review, see Refs. 4Descoteaux A.

Lipids are also essential cell constituents and, therefore, must be constantly synthesized to allow multiplication of the parasite. This suggests that the pathways leading to their synthesis are essential for parasite proliferation and pathogenesis and, thus, offer a reasonable target for rational design of new anti-leishmanial drugs. In fact, a lipid-based drug, miltefosine, is a potent antileishmanial compound that inhibits parasite growth in vitro and in vivo and is currently used for treatment of visceral and mucocutaneous forms of leishmaniasis (9Croft S.L.

Bishop J.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 386: 170-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The product of this first acylation reaction, 1-acyl-DHAP, is then converted to 1-alkyl-DHAP by a FAD-dependent alkyl DHAP synthase (14de Vet E.C. Hilkes Y.H. Fraaije M.W. van den Bosch H. J. Biol.

Alternatively, 1-acyl-DHAP can be reduced to 1-acyl-G3P by an NADPH-dependent 1-alkyl/1-acyl-DHAP reductase, which is then used for the biosynthesis of ester phospholipids. The relative contribution of the DHAP acylation step in the biosynthesis of ester phospholipids has not yet been firmly established (15Hajra A.K. Prog.

This enzyme was also found to be part of a heterotrimeric complex that includes the 1-alkyl-DHAP synthase (22Biermann J. Just W.W. Wanders R.J. Van Den Bosch H. Eur. J.

We showed that this activity was encoded by a single gene, LmGAT, whose deletion resulted in a major defect in the synthesis of triacylglycerols but had little or no effect on the biosynthesis of ester and ether phospholipids, suggesting that G3P is not the primary lipid precursor for membrane biogenesis in Leishmania promastigotes (27Zufferey R. Ben Mamoun C. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56 (B. C.): 800-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In an attempt to evaluate the importance of dihydroxyacetone phosphate in parasite lipid metabolism and development, we have isolated and characterized the gene LmDAT encoding the DHAPAT enzyme involved in the acylation of this precursor. We provide evidence that LmDAT is the only dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase of the parasite, residing in peroxisome-like organelles termed glycosomes in Leishmania and related parasites, important for optimal growth during the exponential phase and for survival at high cell density and essential for virulence. These data suggest that acylation of DHAP may represent the major pathway for the synthesis of glycerolipids in Leishmania.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Growth Conditions—Promastigotes of Leishmania major Friedlin V1 strain (MHOM/IL/80/Friedlin) were maintained in liquid and semi-solid M199-derived medium (28Zufferey R.

To examine parasite proliferation, parasites were collected at mid-log phase, diluted to 5 × 105 parasites/ml, and incubated at 26 °C. Growth was monitored by collecting samples over time and counting them using a hemacytometer. Limiting dilution assays were carried out by diluting parasite cultures with fresh media to 5 parasites/ml. 200-μl samples of this diluted culture were transferred into a 96-well plate. The plates were incubated for 2 weeks at 26 °C, and the presence of parasites was monitored by light microscopy.Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table 1.

C.): 9222-9232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) activity was measured as previously described (27Zufferey R. Ben Mamoun C. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56 (B. C.): 800-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) using 100–200 μg of protein. DHAPAT activity was assessed by measuring the acylation rate of DHAP. This substrate was synthesized from fructose-1,6-bisphosphate as described by Bates and Saggerson (34Bates E.J. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1979; 182: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The assay was performed in a 0.5-ml final volume in a buffer containing 120 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4 mm MgCl2, 8 mm NaF, 4 mg/ml fatty acid poor albumin, 100 μm acyl-CoA, 0.25 unit of aldolase, 7 units of triose phosphate isomerase, 0.1% CHAPS, and 0.5–1 mg of protein. Assays were performed at 30 °C unless otherwise stated. For the pH-dependent DHAPAT assay, a 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer set up at different pH values was used. The specificity of l-[U-14C]glycerol 3-phosphate (Amersham Biosciences) and d-[fructose-U-14C] 1,6-bisphosphate (MP Biomedicals) were 149 and 295 mCi/mmol, respectively. DHAPAT and GPAT reaction products were verified by analytical thin layer chromatography using Silica Gel 60A plates (Whatman) and a solvent made of chloroform, methanol, acetic acid, 5% aqueous sodium metabisulfite (75:30:9:3, v/v/v/v). The plates were sprayed with EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) before autoradiography. The Rf values for 1-acyl-G3P and 1-acyl-DHAP were 2.1 and 3.5, respectively.Malate dehydrogenase assay was performed in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.21 mm oxaloacetate and 0.26 mm NADH. The assay was initiated by the addition of 20 μg of Leishmania protein extracts, and the decrease in absorbance was monitored spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 340 nm.Microscopy—Differential interference contrast (DIC) analysis was performed using promastigotes fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on polylysine-coated slides. Immunofluorescence assay was performed with wild-type parasites alone or transformed with pL-BSD.HV-LmDAT (Ec247) as described previously (28Zufferey R. Allen S. Barron T. Sullivan D.R. Denny P.W. Almeida I.C. Smith D.F. Turco S.J. Ferguson M.A. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44708-44718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The recombinant His6-V5 tagged HV-LmDAT was revealed with V5 monoclonal antibodies (Invitrogen) and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase with specific rabbit polyclonal immunoglobulins (generous gifts of A. Jardim). Both antibodies were used at a 1:500 dilution. Images were taken with a Nikon fluorescence microscope.Analysis of Cell Death—Parasites were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and stained in the presence of 1 μg/ml propidium iodide (PrI) in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min before being analyzed by flow cytometry.Virulence Assays in Mice—Virulence assays were performed as described in Zufferey et al. (28Zufferey R. Allen S. Barron T. Sullivan D.R. Denny P.W. Almeida I.C. Smith D.F. Turco S.J. Ferguson M.A. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44708-44718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, parasites derived from a 3-day stationary culture were washed once in cold saline buffer. 1 × 106 or 1 × 107 cells were injected subcutaneously in the right rear footpad of 6–8-week-old female BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratory). Infections were monitored by comparing the thickness of the footpad over time using a Vernier caliper.RESULTSCharacterization of the Dihydroxyacetone Phosphate Acyltransferase Activity in L. major Promastigotes—Our genetic and biochemical characterization of the L. major GPAT enzyme LmGAT suggested that the lipid precursor G3P does not play an essential function in parasite development or biosynthesis of its major acyl- and alkylglycerolipids. To examine the importance of the second lipid precursor DHAP in parasite membrane biogenesis and development, we characterized its first acylation step (DHAPAT activity) in whole cell extracts. DHAPAT activity was linear during ∼8 min of incubation and reached a plateau thereafter when measured at 30 °C (Fig. 1A). When the assay was performed at 0 °C, only marginal activity could be detected, indicating that this reaction is enzymatic. Kinetic studies were conducted by varying the concentration of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to obtain a substrate saturation curve. DHAPAT activity reached its maximum when the substrate concentration was ∼2 mm (Fig. 1B). From these data, a Vmax of 208.8 ± 33.6 pmol/min × mg and a Km of 0.47 ± 0.1 mm could be calculated, indicating that DHAPAT activity in Leishmania involves a relatively low affinity DHAPAT enzyme(s). The specificity of DHAPAT was assessed by testing different fatty acyl-CoA donors that differ in length and/or saturation. The best activities were obtained when palmitoyl-CoA was present in the assay, whereas myristoyl-CoA, stearoyl-CoA, and linoleoyl-CoA all resulted in lower activities. The least effective fatty acyl-CoA donors were dodecyl-, palmitoleoyl-, oleoyl-, and arachidoyl-CoA (Fig. 1C).Identification of LmDAT—To isolate the gene encoding the L. major DHAPAT activity, we searched the L. major genome for proteins harboring the four signature motifs important for acyltransferase activity (35Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In addition to the LmGAT gene, we identified an open reading frame of ∼4.3 kilobases encoding a protein of 1436 amino acids, which we termed LmDAT (for dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltranferase) that exhibits significant similarity (∼35% identity and ∼55% similarity) to other eukaryotic DHAPATs (Fig. 2B). The most conserved region in the enzyme encompasses amino acids 680–975 and harbors the four canonical domains involved in substrate recognition and catalysis (Fig. 2B (35Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 36Coleman R.A. Lewin T.M. Muoio D.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 77-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar)). Interestingly, unlike human and other higher eukaryotic DHAPATs, LmDAT contains an unusual N-terminal domain of ∼650 amino acids. Homologs of LmDAT in the Trypanosomatidae family such as Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei also harbor this N-terminal domain and share a high degree of identity and similarity with LmDAT over the whole protein length. A specific homology search of available protein databases with this N-terminal domain failed to identify any similarity to known proteins. The C-terminal domain of LmDAT contains a signature tripeptide SKM for localization to the glycosomes (37Sommer J.M. Wang C.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 105-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2DHAPAT sequence alignment. A, schematic representation of DHAPAT orthologs from T. cruzi, T. brucei, human, rat (Rattus norvegicus), Caenorhabditis elegans, and fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster).

The C-terminal glycosomal/peroxisomal tripeptide is represented by an open rectangle.

Immunofluorescence analysis using a V5-specific monoclonal antibody revealed a signal diagnostic of glycosomal proteins. Indeed colocalization studies revealed a perfect colocalization between HV-LmDAT and the glycosomal marker, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (38Shih S. Hwang H.Y. Carter D. Stenberg P. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1534-1541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). No signal could be detected in non-transfected cells using anti-V5 antibody (Fig. 3). These data suggest that LmDAT is localized to the glycosomes (21Heise N. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3LmDAT is localized to the glycosomes.

GAT1+gat2Δ and gat1ΔGAT2+ single deletion mutants are viable, whereas a double mutant, gat1Δgat2Δ, is lethal. To genetically assess the function of LmDAT, we examined whether LmDAT can rescue the lethal phenotype of the yeast double mutant gat1Δgat2Δ lacking the GAT1 and GAT2 genes (32Zaremberg V.

Kell is a polymorphic protein, and 25 different phenotypes, because of point mutations resulting in single amino acid substitutions, have been described. It was recently reported that a recombinant form of KEL1 (K, K1) phenotype, expressed in K562 and HEK293 cells, had no endothelin-3-converting activity, in contrast to the common KEL2 (k, K2) phenotype. We demonstrate that KEL1 red blood cells and also a soluble recombinant form of KEL1 protein (s-Kell KEL1) have similar enzymatic activity as the common Kell phenotype. In addition we show that KEL6 red blood cells, which are more prevalent in persons of African heritage than in Caucasians also have endothelin-3-converting enzyme activity and that the recombinant soluble form of KEL6 protein (s-Kell KEL6) has similar Km values as the wild-type.

The Kell blood group system is highly polymorphic, expressing over 25 antigens that have been classified into five antithetical sets of high and low prevalence antigens with the others being independently expressed or having unknown antithetical partners. The different phenotypes are due to single nucleotide mutations that result in an amino acid substitution (1Lee S. Vox Sang. 1997; 73: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 2Lee S. Russo D. Redman C. Transfus. Med. Rev. 2000; 14: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Two antithetical allelic sets of antigens, KEL1 (K, K1)/KEL2 (k, K2) and KEL6 (Jsa)/KEL7(Jsb) are of particular interest because they are more prevalent in certain racial groups. For example, KEL1 is present in 9% of Caucasians and in 2% of persons of African heritage, whereas KEL6 is present in 20% of persons of African heritage and in less than 1% of Caucasians. KEL1 is due to a 698C→ T mutation that results in a Thr193 → Met substitution at an N-glycosylation consensus sequence (3Lee S. Wu X. Reid M. Zelinski T. Redman C. Blood. 1995; 85: 912-916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). KEL6 is due to a 1910T→ C mutation that results in a Leu597 → Pro substitution, which is located between two closely placed non-conserved cysteine residues (596CPAC599), and the antigen is more sensitive to reducing agents (4Lee S.

Lin M. Mele A. Cao Y. Farmar J. Russo D. Redman C. Blood. 1999; 94: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the M13 family, Kell is unique in that it is linked, through a single disulfide bond (16Carbonnet F. Hattab C. Collec E. Le Van K.C. Cartron J.P. Bertrand O. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 96: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Russo D. Redman C. Lee S. J. Biol.

Chelly J. Carter N. Danek A. Crocker P. Monaco A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 869-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, the extracellular domain of Kell expressed as a soluble recombinant form retains its endothelin-3-converting enzyme activity. A three-dimensional model of Kell protein, constructed on the basis of the crystal structure of neutral endopeptidase 24.11, showed that Kell has two globular extracellular domains (19Lee S. Debnath A.K. Redman C.M. Blood. 2003; 102: 3028-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The domain closest to the cell membrane contains the enzyme-active site. The surface of the other domain, away from the enzyme active site contains the amino acid residues whose substitutions lead to the different phenotypes.Because of the unequal distribution of KEL1 and KEL6 in different racial groups we studied their catalytic activity. In contrast to the recent report by Clapéron et al. (20Clapéron A. Rose C. Gane P. Collec E. Bertrand O. Ouimet T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21272-21283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that KEL1 red blood cells and a recombinant form of KEL1 phenotype have a similar big ET-3-cleaving activity to the common KEL2 phenotype.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of Recombinant Soluble KEL1 Protein (s-Kell KEL1)— Two overlapping PCR products were produced using each one of the primers containing the KEL1 mutation. The template for the PCR was the common Kell cDNA. The two overlapping PCR products were joined by another PCR to yield the complete cDNA. The primer sequences of the two PCRs are as follows: PCR1, (EX1F) 5′-CAGTCCTCCGAATCAGCTCCTAGA-3′ and (K1R) 5′-ACTGACTCATCAGAAGTCTCAGCATTCGG-3′; PCR2, (NK1F) 5′-GGACTTCCTTAAACTTTAACCGAATGCTG-3′ and (2316R) 5′-GCTGTGGCATCTTTGGTACC-3′. The underlined bold letter in the primer sequence is the incorporated KEL1 mutation.The 230-bp cDNA segment with the KEL1 mutation, obtained by cutting the PCR product with EcoRI and AvrII, replaced a DNA segment between EcoRI and AvrII sites of a wild-type s-Kell construct with an N-terminal six-histidine tag, which was in a pAcGp67A vector (BD Biosciences) (15Lee S. Lin M. Mele A. Cao Y. Farmar J. Russo D. Redman C. Blood. 1999; 94: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Clapéron A. Rose C. Gane P. Collec E. Bertrand O. Ouimet T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21272-21283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The sequence of the construct was verified by DNA sequencing. The preparation of common s-Kell and s-Kell KEL6 expression constructs has been described previously (15Lee S. Lin M. Mele A. Cao Y. Farmar J. Russo D. Redman C. Blood. 1999; 94: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Expression of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant s-Kell proteins were expressed in serum-free condition using Ex-cell 400 medium (JRH Biosciences, St. Lenexa, KS) and sf9 cells (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The absence of cross-contamination in s-Kell KEL1 with common s-Kell was determined by isolation of the baculovirus DNA from the expression culture and sequencing the KEL1 region that was amplified by PCR.Isolation of Recombinant s-Kell Proteins—The secreted s-Kell proteins were harvested by affinity chromatography on nickel columns basically following the procedure described previously (15Lee S. Lin M. Mele A. Cao Y. Farmar J. Russo D. Redman C. Blood. 1999; 94: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). s-Kell in the cell medium (3 × 600 μl) was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin column (Ni-NTA spin kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) that had been equilibrated with serum-free cell culture medium (Ex-cell 400 or SF-900 II from Invitrogen). The column was washed once with 50 mmol/liter HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.3 mol/liter NaCl and 20 mmol/liter imidazole and once with the same buffer but with imidazole increased to 50 mmol/liter. Bound protein was eluted with 50 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.3 mol/liter NaCl, and 250 mmol/liter imidazole. The above solutions were made in the serum-free media instead of H2O. The serum-free medium contains non-ionic detergent, which is necessary to maintain the Kell enzyme activity. If the solutions are not made with the serum-free medium, 0.1% Tween 20 is required to retain enzyme activity.Endothelin-converting Enzyme Analysis of KEL1 and KEL6 and Common Kell Phenotype—The recombinant Kell proteins and the human red cells of KEL1, KEL6, Kell null, and common Kell phenotype were assayed for their abilities to process big ET-1, big ET-2, and big ET-3 using an endothelin enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI) that was previously described (15Lee S. Lin M. Mele A. Cao Y. Farmar J. Russo D. Redman C. Blood. 1999; 94: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Big ET-1, big ET-2, or big ET-3 (0.1 μmol/liter) were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with assay buffer (50 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 6.0, 50 μmol/liter ZnCl2, and 150 mmol/liter NaCl containing 0.25% (v/v) of supernatant of boiled bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml)) and various amounts of s-Kell. The final volume was 200 μl. At the end of the incubation time, an equal volume of 5 mmol/liter EDTA was added to terminate the reaction, and the samples were kept in ice until enzyme immunoassay was performed. To determine whether the KEL1 protein is inactivated by the conditions used by Clapéron et al. (20Clapéron A. Rose C. Gane P. Collec E. Bertrand O. Ouimet T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21272-21283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the purified s-Kell and s-Kell KEL1 were stored at 4 °C for 16 h in the presence of 2% Brij-58 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) prior to the enzyme assay. When Km values were determined for big ET-3, the substrate concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 0.6 μmol/liter, and the incubation time was 10 min.RESULTSKEL1 and KEL6 Phenotype Red Blood Cells Have Endothelin-3-converting Enzyme Activities Comparable to Common Kell-type Red Blood Cells—The endothelin-converting enzyme activities of red blood cells with KEL1, Kell null and common phenotype were compared. As previously shown, common Kell-type red blood cells preferentially cleave big ET-3 releasing ET-3 and have much less activity with big ET-1 and big ET-2 as substrates. Kell null red blood cells have minimal background activity (15Lee S. Lin M. Mele A. Cao Y. Farmar J. Russo D. Redman C. Blood. 1999; 94: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Clapéron A.

The KEL1 red blood cells were comparable to the common Kell red blood cells and also preferentially activated ET-3 (Fig. 1A). The KEL6 (Jsa) red blood cells, like the common Kell-type red blood cells, were also capable of cleaving big ET-3 and producing ET-3 (Fig. 1B). KEL6 red blood cells also preferentially cleaved big ET-3 (data not shown).Soluble Recombinant Proteins of Common Kell-type, KEL1 Phenotype, and KEL6 Phenotype Have the Same Endothelin-3-converting Enzyme Activities—Km and kcat values for common Kell, KEL1, and KEL6 soluble recombinant proteins, using big ET-3 as substrate, were measured by enzyme immunoassay. The results are summarized in Table 1. KEL1 and KEL6 proteins had similar Km and kcat values as the common Kell protein.

Chem. 2005; 280: 21272-21283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which reported that recombinant KEL1 protein expressed on the surface of HEK293 and K562 cells did not have endothelin-3-converting enzyme activity, whereas the common KEL2 did, our results clearly demonstrated that both KEL1 red blood cells and a soluble recombinant form of KEL1 have similar enzyme activity as the wild-type forms. The reasons for the discrepancy are not clear. The possibility of loss of enzyme activity of KEL1 protein during purification of the recombinant native Kell KEL1 (K1) was checked by storing the purified wild-type s-Kell and s-Kell KEL1 in the same conditions as described by Clapéron et al. (20Clapéron A. Rose C. Gane P. Collec E. Bertrand O. Ouimet T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21272-21283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The soluble recombinant proteins were kept in the presence of 2% Brij-58 and 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 16 h prior to the enzyme assay. There was no reduction in s-Kell KEL1 enzyme activity.The KEL1 phenotype arises from a Thr193 → Met substitution that occurs in an N-glycosylation site, and KEL1 is expected to have four instead of five N-linked sugar moieties. It is possible that this mutation may affect the processing and insertion of Kell protein on the cell surface in a recombinant system. This is unlikely, however, because the KEL1 recombinant protein was detected by antibodies on the cell surface.In our study both intact KEL1 and KEL6 red blood cells, which mimic the in vivo conditions, and soluble recombinant proteins that express the extracellular domains show very similar activity to their wild-type counterparts. This is perhaps not surprising because a three-dimensional model of the extracellular sequences of Kell protein indicates the presence of two separate globular domains. The mutation that leads to the KEL1 amino acid substitution is present in the outer globular domain, quite distinct from the globular domain that is closer to the plasma membrane and contains the enzyme active site. Although the Leu597 → Pro mutation that leads to the KEL6 amino acid substitution appears in a linear model to be present near the zinc-binding motif, a three-dimensional model places it on the surface, away from the enzyme active site (19Lee S. Debnath A.K. Redman C.M. Blood. 2003; 102: 3028-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).The presence of endothelin-3-converting enzyme activity in KEL1 red blood cells is not due to an unrelated protease because Kell null (Ko) red blood cells have no endothelin-converting activity (15Lee S. Lin M. Mele A. Cao Y. Farmar J. Russo D. Redman C. Blood. 1999; 94: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lee S. Russo D.C. Reiner A.P. Lee J.H. Sy M.Y. Telen M.J. Judd W.J. Simon P. Rodrigues M.J. Chabert T. Poole J. Jovanovic-Srzentic S. Levene C. Yahalom V. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27281-27289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The specificity of the assay for the endothelin-3-converting enzyme activity is also shown by the fact that a recombinant s-Kell (E582G), in which the enzyme-active site was mutated and was prepared in the same way as s-Kell KEL1, also had no endothelin-3-converting enzyme activity (15Lee S. Lin M. Mele A. Cao Y. Farmar J. Russo D. Redman C. Blood. 1999; 94: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The KEL6 phenotype occurs in ∼20% of persons with African heritage and in <1% in other populations. This has led to the suggestion that the KEL6 phenotype may offer a selective advantage to Africans. However, our study indicates that if this is the case, it is not due to a difference in endothelin-converting activity, because KEL6 red blood cells have similar endothelin-3-converting enzyme activity as the wild-type red blood cells and also showed similar substrate preference for big ET-3 over big ET-1 and big ET-2. The Kell blood group system is highly polymorphic, expressing over 25 antigens that have been classified into five antithetical sets of high and low prevalence antigens with the others being independently expressed or having unknown antithetical partners. The different phenotypes are due to single nucleotide mutations that result in an amino acid substitution (1Lee S. Vox Sang. 1997; 73: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 2Lee S. Russo D. Redman C. Transfus. Med. Rev. 2000; 14: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Two antithetical allelic sets of antigens, KEL1 (K, K1)/KEL2 (k, K2) and KEL6 (Jsa)/KEL7(Jsb) are of particular interest because they are more prevalent in certain racial groups. For example, KEL1 is present in 9% of Caucasians and in 2% of persons of African heritage, whereas KEL6 is present in 20% of persons of African heritage and in less than 1% of Caucasians. KEL1 is due to a 698C→ T mutation that results in a Thr193 → Met substitution at an N-glycosylation consensus sequence (3Lee S. Wu X. Reid M. Zelinski T. Redman C. Blood. 1995; 85: 912-916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). KEL6 is due to a 1910T→ C mutation that results in a Leu597 → Pro substitution, which is located between two closely placed non-conserved cysteine residues (596CPAC599), and the antigen is more sensitive to reducing agents (4Lee S. Wu X. Reid M. Redman C. Transfusion. 1995; 35: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The Kell blood group protein, a 93-kDa, type II membrane glycoprotein, is a member of the M13 family of zinc endopeptidases (5Lee S. Zambas E.D. Marsh W.L. Redman C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6353-6357Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Within this large group, Kell has significant similarity with six other type II membrane glycoproteins: neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (6Shipp M.A. Richardson N.E. Sayre P.H. Brown N.R. Masteller E.L.

As a group, the M13 family of zinc endopeptidases either degrades bioactive peptides or cleaves intermediate inactive peptides to produce smaller bioactive peptides (14Turner A.J. Brown C.D.

Lin M. Mele A. Cao Y. Farmar J. Russo D. Redman C. Blood. 1999; 94: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the M13 family, Kell is unique in that it is linked, through a single disulfide bond (16Carbonnet F. Hattab C. Collec E. Le Van K.C. Cartron J.P. Bertrand O. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 96: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Russo D. Redman C. Lee S. J. Biol.

Chelly J. Carter N. Danek A. Crocker P. Monaco A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 869-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, the extracellular domain of Kell expressed as a soluble recombinant form retains its endothelin-3-converting enzyme activity. A three-dimensional model of Kell protein, constructed on the basis of the crystal structure of neutral endopeptidase 24.11, showed that Kell has two globular extracellular domains (19Lee S. Debnath A.K. Redman C.M. Blood. 2003; 102: 3028-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The domain closest to the cell membrane contains the enzyme-active site. The surface of the other domain, away from the enzyme active site contains the amino acid residues whose substitutions lead to the different phenotypes. Because of the unequal distribution of KEL1 and KEL6 in different racial groups we studied their catalytic activity. In contrast to the recent report by Clapéron et al. (20Clapéron A. Rose C. Gane P. Collec E. Bertrand O. Ouimet T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21272-21283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that KEL1 red blood cells and a recombinant form of KEL1 phenotype have a similar big ET-3-cleaving activity to the common KEL2 phenotype. MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of Recombinant Soluble KEL1 Protein (s-Kell KEL1)— Two overlapping PCR products were produced using each one of the primers containing the KEL1 mutation. The template for the PCR was the common Kell cDNA. The two overlapping PCR products were joined by another PCR to yield the complete cDNA. The primer sequences of the two PCRs are as follows: PCR1, (EX1F) 5′-CAGTCCTCCGAATCAGCTCCTAGA-3′ and (K1R) 5′-ACTGACTCATCAGAAGTCTCAGCATTCGG-3′; PCR2, (NK1F) 5′-GGACTTCCTTAAACTTTAACCGAATGCTG-3′ and (2316R) 5′-GCTGTGGCATCTTTGGTACC-3′. The underlined bold letter in the primer sequence is the incorporated KEL1 mutation.The 230-bp cDNA segment with the KEL1 mutation, obtained by cutting the PCR product with EcoRI and AvrII, replaced a DNA segment between EcoRI and AvrII sites of a wild-type s-Kell construct with an N-terminal six-histidine tag, which was in a pAcGp67A vector (BD Biosciences) (15Lee S.

Chem. 2005; 280: 21272-21283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The sequence of the construct was verified by DNA sequencing. The preparation of common s-Kell and s-Kell KEL6 expression constructs has been described previously (15Lee S. Lin M. Mele A. Cao Y. Farmar J. Russo D. Redman C. Blood. 1999; 94: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Expression of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant s-Kell proteins were expressed in serum-free condition using Ex-cell 400 medium (JRH Biosciences, St. Lenexa, KS) and sf9 cells (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The absence of cross-contamination in s-Kell KEL1 with common s-Kell was determined by isolation of the baculovirus DNA from the expression culture and sequencing the KEL1 region that was amplified by PCR.Isolation of Recombinant s-Kell Proteins—The secreted s-Kell proteins were harvested by affinity chromatography on nickel columns basically following the procedure described previously (15Lee S. Lin M. Mele A. Cao Y. Farmar J. Russo D. Redman C. Blood. 1999; 94: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). s-Kell in the cell medium (3 × 600 μl) was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin column (Ni-NTA spin kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) that had been equilibrated with serum-free cell culture medium (Ex-cell 400 or SF-900 II from Invitrogen). The column was washed once with 50 mmol/liter HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.3 mol/liter NaCl and 20 mmol/liter imidazole and once with the same buffer but with imidazole increased to 50 mmol/liter. Bound protein was eluted with 50 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.3 mol/liter NaCl, and 250 mmol/liter imidazole. The above solutions were made in the serum-free media instead of H2O. The serum-free medium contains non-ionic detergent, which is necessary to maintain the Kell enzyme activity. If the solutions are not made with the serum-free medium, 0.1% Tween 20 is required to retain enzyme activity.Endothelin-converting Enzyme Analysis of KEL1 and KEL6 and Common Kell Phenotype—The recombinant Kell proteins and the human red cells of KEL1, KEL6, Kell null, and common Kell phenotype were assayed for their abilities to process big ET-1, big ET-2, and big ET-3 using an endothelin enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI) that was previously described (15Lee S. Lin M. Mele A. Cao Y. Farmar J. Russo D. Redman C. Blood. 1999; 94: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Big ET-1, big ET-2, or big ET-3 (0.1 μmol/liter) were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with assay buffer (50 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 6.0, 50 μmol/liter ZnCl2, and 150 mmol/liter NaCl containing 0.25% (v/v) of supernatant of boiled bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml)) and various amounts of s-Kell. The final volume was 200 μl. At the end of the incubation time, an equal volume of 5 mmol/liter EDTA was added to terminate the reaction, and the samples were kept in ice until enzyme immunoassay was performed. To determine whether the KEL1 protein is inactivated by the conditions used by Clapéron et al. (20Clapéron A. Rose C. Gane P. Collec E. Bertrand O. Ouimet T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21272-21283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the purified s-Kell and s-Kell KEL1 were stored at 4 °C for 16 h in the presence of 2% Brij-58 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) prior to the enzyme assay. When Km values were determined for big ET-3, the substrate concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 0.6 μmol/liter, and the incubation time was 10 min.

RESULTSKEL1 and KEL6 Phenotype Red Blood Cells Have Endothelin-3-converting Enzyme Activities Comparable to Common Kell-type Red Blood Cells—The endothelin-converting enzyme activities of red blood cells with KEL1, Kell null and common phenotype were compared. As previously shown, common Kell-type red blood cells preferentially cleave big ET-3 releasing ET-3 and have much less activity with big ET-1 and big ET-2 as substrates.

DISCUSSIONIn contrast to a recent publication by Clapéron et al. (20Clapéron A. Rose C. Gane P. Collec E. Bertrand O. Ouimet T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21272-21283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which reported that recombinant KEL1 protein expressed on the surface of HEK293 and K562 cells did not have endothelin-3-converting enzyme activity, whereas the common KEL2 did, our results clearly demonstrated that both KEL1 red blood cells and a soluble recombinant form of KEL1 have similar enzyme activity as the wild-type forms. The reasons for the discrepancy are not clear. The possibility of loss of enzyme activity of KEL1 protein during purification of the recombinant native Kell KEL1 (K1) was checked by storing the purified wild-type s-Kell and s-Kell KEL1 in the same conditions as described by Clapéron et al. (20Clapéron A. Rose C. Gane P. Collec E. Bertrand O. Ouimet T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21272-21283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The soluble recombinant proteins were kept in the presence of 2% Brij-58 and 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 16 h prior to the enzyme assay. There was no reduction in s-Kell KEL1 enzyme activity.The KEL1 phenotype arises from a Thr193 → Met substitution that occurs in an N-glycosylation site, and KEL1 is expected to have four instead of five N-linked sugar moieties. It is possible that this mutation may affect the processing and insertion of Kell protein on the cell surface in a recombinant system. This is unlikely, however, because the KEL1 recombinant protein was detected by antibodies on the cell surface.In our study both intact KEL1 and KEL6 red blood cells, which mimic the in vivo conditions, and soluble recombinant proteins that express the extracellular domains show very similar activity to their wild-type counterparts. This is perhaps not surprising because a three-dimensional model of the extracellular sequences of Kell protein indicates the presence of two separate globular domains. The mutation that leads to the KEL1 amino acid substitution is present in the outer globular domain, quite distinct from the globular domain that is closer to the plasma membrane and contains the enzyme active site. Although the Leu597 → Pro mutation that leads to the KEL6 amino acid substitution appears in a linear model to be present near the zinc-binding motif, a three-dimensional model places it on the surface, away from the enzyme active site (19Lee S. Debnath A.K. Redman C.M. Blood. 2003; 102: 3028-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).The presence of endothelin-3-converting enzyme activity in KEL1 red blood cells is not due to an unrelated protease because Kell null (Ko) red blood cells have no endothelin-converting activity (15Lee S.

The specificity of the assay for the endothelin-3-converting enzyme activity is also shown by the fact that a recombinant s-Kell (E582G), in which the enzyme-active site was mutated and was prepared in the same way as s-Kell KEL1, also had no endothelin-3-converting enzyme activity (15Lee S. Lin M. Mele A. Cao Y. Farmar J. Russo D. Redman C. Blood. 1999; 94: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The KEL6 phenotype occurs in ∼20% of persons with African heritage and in <1% in other populations. This has led to the suggestion that the KEL6 phenotype may offer a selective advantage to Africans. However, our study indicates that if this is the case, it is not due to a difference in endothelin-converting activity, because KEL6 red blood cells have similar endothelin-3-converting enzyme activity as the wild-type red blood cells and also showed similar substrate preference for big ET-3 over big ET-1 and big ET-2. In contrast to a recent publication by Clapéron et al. (20Clapéron A. Rose C. Gane P. Collec E. Bertrand O. Ouimet T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21272-21283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which reported that recombinant KEL1 protein expressed on the surface of HEK293 and K562 cells did not have endothelin-3-converting enzyme activity, whereas the common KEL2 did, our results clearly demonstrated that both KEL1 red blood cells and a soluble recombinant form of KEL1 have similar enzyme activity as the wild-type forms. The reasons for the discrepancy are not clear. The possibility of loss of enzyme activity of KEL1 protein during purification of the recombinant native Kell KEL1 (K1) was checked by storing the purified wild-type s-Kell and s-Kell KEL1 in the same conditions as described by Clapéron et al. (20Clapéron A. Rose C. Gane P. Collec E. Bertrand O. Ouimet T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21272-21283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The soluble recombinant proteins were kept in the presence of 2% Brij-58 and 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 16 h prior to the enzyme assay. There was no reduction in s-Kell KEL1 enzyme activity. The KEL1 phenotype arises from a Thr193 → Met substitution that occurs in an N-glycosylation site, and KEL1 is expected to have four instead of five N-linked sugar moieties. It is possible that this mutation may affect the processing and insertion of Kell protein on the cell surface in a recombinant system. This is unlikely, however, because the KEL1 recombinant protein was detected by antibodies on the cell surface. In our study both intact KEL1 and KEL6 red blood cells, which mimic the in vivo conditions, and soluble recombinant proteins that express the extracellular domains show very similar activity to their wild-type counterparts. This is perhaps not surprising because a three-dimensional model of the extracellular sequences of Kell protein indicates the presence of two separate globular domains. The mutation that leads to the KEL1 amino acid substitution is present in the outer globular domain, quite distinct from the globular domain that is closer to the plasma membrane and contains the enzyme active site. Although the Leu597 → Pro mutation that leads to the KEL6 amino acid substitution appears in a linear model to be present near the zinc-binding motif, a three-dimensional model places it on the surface, away from the enzyme active site (19Lee S.

The peptidergic dorsal paired medial (DPM) neurons, which innervate the mushroom bodies in Drosophila, have been widely hypothesized to be part of the unconditioned stimulus (US) pathway of odor-shock classical conditioning. In the December 2 issue of Cell, Yu et al., using functional imaging techniques, report the surprising finding that DPMs contain odor-specific memory traces and send integrated information about the conditioned stimulus (CS) to the mushroom bodies. These findings provide important new insight into the circuitry of learning in Drosophila. The goal of many early behavioral genetics researchers was to find “learning genes.” These genes would be involved in processes unique to the formation of memory. As the field evolved and genetic screens were done in Drosophila, it looked very much like such genes had been found. But the cloning of these genes and the isolation of additional, often pleiotropic, alleles cast a shadow over the learning gene idea because many of the genes encoded proteins that had very general roles in cell function. Researchers quickly moved on to identifying the places where the learning genes were expressed to try and determine whether the localization of these gene products would specify circuits for memory in the brain. In one case, functional localization identified a very limited region—amnesiac (amn) expression in the fly adult brain was required in the two DPM neurons (Waddell et al., 2000Waddell S. Armstrong J.D. Kitamoto T. Kaiser K. Quinn W.G. Cell. 2000; 103: 805-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In other cases, localization studies pointed to the adult mushroom bodies as a likely venue for memory formation, but there were also many learning genes with spatially and temporally broad expression. Recent years have brought elegant studies that manipulate the function of candidate genes both in time and space, and the basic circuitry for several forms of learning has been worked out (cf. Joiner and Griffith, 1999Joiner M.A. Griffith L.C. Learn. Mem. 1999; 6: 177-192PubMed Google Scholar, McGuire et al., 2004McGuire S.E. Mao Z. Davis R.L. Sci.

Mem. 2000; 7: 18-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The addition of genetic tools to either kill or silence circuit components has allowed further refinement of these models. In this way, Drosophila research has pushed the field of learning and memory into very molecular territory. The power of genetics has allowed the identification of many genes that have subsequently been shown to be critical to mammalian plasticity. So what is missing? Why do we not completely understand memory in the fly? Until recently, Drosophila has lagged sorrowfully behind big insects and many vertebrates in that it was not possible to routinely obtain functional information from the intact adult CNS. While fly people were piling up molecules and building virtual circuits, other neurobiologists were observing the behavior of neurons in real circuits, with electrodes and functional imaging. As demonstrated by the work of Yu and colleagues, and others, the melding of the genetic and functional approaches is likely to provide multiplicative gains in our understanding of plasticity (Riemensperger et al., 2005Riemensperger T. Voller T. Stock P. Buchner E. Fiala A. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1953-1960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, Yu et al., 2004Yu D. Ponomarev A. Davis R.L.

Cell. 2005; 123: 945-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). An important role for DPM neurons in associative memory was first suggested by the finding that the PACAP-like neuropeptides encoded by the amn gene were preferentially expressed in these cells (Waddell et al., 2000Waddell S. Armstrong J.D. Kitamoto T. Kaiser K. Quinn W.G. Cell. 2000; 103: 805-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). amn mutants had long been known to have defects in the translation of short-term into medium-term memory (Quinn et al., 1979Quinn W.G. Sziber P.P. Booker R. Nature. 1979; 277: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and blockade of neurotransmission from DPMs phenocopied the amn mutant (Waddell et al., 2000Waddell S. Armstrong J.D. Kitamoto T. Kaiser K. Quinn W.G. Cell. 2000; 103: 805-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Further study revealed that blocking DPM output during the interval between training and testing disrupted memory assayed 3 hr after training, while blockade during training or retrieval had no effect (Keene et al., 2004Keene A.C. Stratmann M. Keller A. Perrat P.N. Vosshall L.B. Waddell S. Neuron. 2004; 44: 521-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This phenotype, coupled with the fact that DPMs innervate the entire mushroom body neuropil made them an excellent candidate to be the bearer of reinforcing, or US, information in odor-shock learning. Peptidergic and aminergic neurons in a number of systems are believed to fulfill this role. Modulation in the Aplysia gill withdrawal circuit is carried out by both serotonin and peptides (Abrams et al., 1984Abrams T.W. Castellucci V.F. Camardo J.S. Kandel E.R. Lloyd P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1984; 81: 7956-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The bioamines octopamine (in insects) and dopamine (in insects and mammals) have been shown to be reinforcers (Hammer, 1997Hammer M. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 245-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, Schultz, 2001Schultz W. Neuroscientist. 2001; 7: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, Schwaerzel et al., 2003Schwaerzel M. Monastirioti M. Scholz H. Friggi-Grelin F. Birman S. Heisenberg M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10495-10502PubMed Google Scholar). To more directly test the hypothesis that DPMs signal the US, Yu and coworkers used state-of-the-art imaging technology to get a glimpse into this cell as the fly is learning. Using synapto-pHlorin, an activity-dependent marker of vesicle fusion, and G-CaMP, a calcium indicator, they asked the very simple question: what happens to the activity of the DPM neuron during memory formation? If it was part of the US input pathway to the mushroom body, this would predict activity regulated by shock but not odor, the CS. What they saw was a surprise. In naive animals, the DPM was responsive to electric shock, but it also responded robustly to every odor they tested. DPMs therefore are capable of responding to both the US and CS cues used in odor-shock classical conditioning. To determine whether learning would modify DPM responses, Yu et al. applied a classical conditioning protocol to the animal during imaging. No changes were observed in odor responses 3 min after conditioning, a time when memory is unaffected by amn mutations. When the investigators looked at calcium influx 30 min after conditioning, however, they saw a CS-specific increase in the activity of the DPM with no change in the response to odors that had not been paired with electric shock. This change in activity lasted at least an hour, remarkably coincident with the temporal window in which they show that DPM activity is required for memory consolidation. The expression of this odor-specific increase in activity was dependent on amn, because it was absent in two independent alleles of amn but could be rescued by providing Amn to DPM with a transgene. An additional interesting observation made by this group was that the increase in activity was only seen in the vertical, α/α′ lobes, while activity in the horizontal, β/β′/γ lobes remained constant. There has been suggestion that α/α′ is specifically involved in the formation of long-term memory (Pascual and Preat, 2001Pascual A. Preat T. Science. 2001; 294: 1115-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and the finding that memory-related activity in DPM is directed at this structure is consistent with that idea. But what does this tell us about the circuitry of associative learning in flies and the role of DPM? The first and most apparent thing is that DPM is not a “simple” modulatory neuron carrying a single channel of information into the mushroom body where it becomes integrated with information from other sensory channels (Figure 1, top). The second thing that is clear is that DPM is receiving information about the CS, odor, from an unknown source (Figure 1, bottom). Olfactory information in Drosophila is processed in the antennal lobes and goes out to the rest of the brain via projection neurons that are the invertebrate analogs of mitral cells. The projection neurons have clear inputs to the calyx of the mushroom bodies, where the Kenyon cell somata reside, and to cells in the rather ill-defined lateral horn. The anatomy of the DPM limits the possible site of inputs to either its soma or to its projection field in the mushroom body lobes. Because invertebrate neurons commonly have projections that contain both presynaptic and postsynaptic specializations, it is likely that odor information is being received within the mushroom bodies either from the Kenyon cells themselves or from other neurons that project into that neuropil. The third and most interesting feature of DPMs revealed by this study is their relay of processed information about the specific CS-US pair into the mushroom body lobes. One attractive idea is that DPM might itself be an integrator of US and CS information and a repository of a memory trace. This would imply that DPM receives “raw” information about the CS (from olfactory inputs or mushroom body) and the US (perhaps via dopaminergic inputs into the lobes, Riemensperger et al., 2005Riemensperger T. Voller T. Stock P. Buchner E. Fiala A. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1953-1960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and does a computation. But the fact that an association-specific activity is present in DPM does not necessarily imply that DPM is itself an integrator. If the CS and US information comes into DPM from Kenyon cells, it is possible that association and the alteration in the strength of the signal might be a result of mushroom body processing. In this scenario, DPM is a follower—perhaps part of a positive-feedback loop that stabilizes the memory trace in the mushroom body. This second possibility is supported by Waddell's finding (Waddell et al., 2000Waddell S. Armstrong J.D. Kitamoto T. Kaiser K. Quinn W.G. Cell. 2000; 103: 805-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) that 3 min memory is unaffected by blocking DPM output, suggesting that this cell does not have a role in the initial association of the US and CS. How can these models be differentiated? Luckily there are genetic tools that can be used with live imaging to dissect the problem. If mushroom bodies are providing CS and/or US information to DPMs then disruption of neurotransmission in Kenyon cells should alter DPM responses to the CS and/or US cues. Previous experiments that silenced these cells during the DPM-requiring epoch of 3 hr memory did not detect a requirement for mushroom body activity at this time (McGuire et al., 2001McGuire S.E. Le P.T. Davis R.L. Science. 2001; 293: 1330-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), but it is possible that the subset of Kenyon cells inactivated in this study did not sufficiently diminish DPM input to block consolidation. Examining these and other candidate inputs to DPM by using imaging or direct recording is now feasible. Determining who is talking to DPM, and when, will be an important next step toward understanding the cellular basis of associative memory formation in Drosophila. Drosophila DPM Neurons Form a Delayed and Branch-Specific Memory Trace after Olfactory Classical ConditioningYu et al.CellDecember 02, 2005In BriefFormation of normal olfactory memory requires the expression of the wild-type amnesiac gene in the dorsal paired medial (DPM) neurons. Imaging the activity in the processes of DPM neurons revealed that the neurons respond when the fly is stimulated with electric shock or with any odor that was tested. Pairing odor and electric-shock stimulation increases odor-evoked calcium signals and synaptic release from DPM neurons. These memory traces form in only one of the two branches of the DPM neuron process. Full-Text PDF Open Archive"
