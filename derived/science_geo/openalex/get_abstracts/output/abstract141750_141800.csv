https://openalex.org/W1967766455,"Differentiated pancreatic β cells are unique in their ability to secrete insulin in response to a rise in plasma glucose. We have proposed that the unique constellation of genes they express may be lost in diabetes due to the deleterious effect of chronic hyperglycemia. To test this hypothesis, Sprague-Dawley rats were submitted to a 85–95% pancreatectomy or sham pancreatectomy. One week later, the animals developed mild to severe chronic hyperglycemia that was stable for the next 3 weeks, without significant alteration of plasma nonesterified fatty acid levels. Expression of many genes important for glucose-induced insulin release decreased progressively with increasing hyperglycemia, in parallel with a reduction of several islet transcription factors involved in β cell development and differentiation. In contrast, genes barely expressed in sham islets (lactate dehydrogenase A and hexokinase I) were markedly increased, in parallel with an increase in the transcription factor c-Myc, a potent stimulator of cell growth. These abnormalities were accompanied by β cell hypertrophy. Changes in gene expression were fully developed 2 weeks after pancreatectomy. Correction of blood glucose by phlorizin for the next 2 weeks normalized islet gene expression and β cell volume without affecting plasma nonesterified fatty acid levels, strongly suggesting that hyperglycemia triggers these abnormalities. In conclusion, chronic hyperglycemia leads to β cell hypertrophy and loss of β cell differentiation that is correlated with changes in c-Myc and other key transcription factors. A similar change in β cell differentiation could contribute to the profound derangement of insulin secretion in human diabetes.

A similar change in β cell differentiation could contribute to the profound derangement of insulin secretion in human diabetes. Pancreatic β cells are highly specialized cells that secrete insulin in response to a variety of stimuli, the most important being glucose (1Prentki M. Matschinsky F.M. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 1185-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Henquin J.C. Weir G.C. Kahn C.R. The Joslin's Diabetes Mellitus. Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia1994: 56-80Google Scholar). Their correct function is dependent on the expression of a unique set of genes that allow β cells to respond to even small increases in plasma glucose levels by releasing appropriate amounts of insulin into the circulation (3Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Type 2 diabetes is characterized by the combination of insulin resistance and profound alteration in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (4DeFronzo R.A. Bonadonna R.C. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 318-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). The latter can be ascribed, at least in part, to the deleterious effect of even mild chronic hyperglycemia and elevated plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) 1The abbreviations used are: NEFA, nonesterified fatty acids; RT, reverse-transcribed; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Px, pancreatectomy; LPx, low hyperglycemic pancreatectomy; MPx, mildly hyperglycemic Px; HPx, highly hyperglycemic Px; SPx, severely hyperglycemic Px; IAPP, islet amyloid polypeptide; GLUT, glucose transporter; HK, hexokinase; mGPDH, mitochondrial glycerol-phosphate dehydrogenase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; K+-ATP channels, ATP-sensitive K+ channels; VDCC, voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels; SERCA, sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; bHLH, basic helix loop helix; ANOVA, analysis of variance; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DABCO, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane on pancreatic β cell function, a process often referred to as “gluco-lipotoxicity” (5Leahy J.L.

In islets isolated from animal models of diabetes, several defects have been identified at the level of gene expression and/or enzymatic activity, but none by itself can entirely account for the β cell defect characteristic of type 2 diabetes (5Leahy J.L. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 103-113Google Scholar, 7Tokuyama Y. Sturis J. Depaoli A.M. Takeda J. Stoffel M. Tang J. Sun X. Polonsky K.S.

Recently, the study of the transcriptional regulation of the insulin gene has led to the identification of several β cell/islet transcription factors that are important for the development of the endocrine pancreas, the tissue-specific expression of key β cell genes and maintenance of β cell differentiation (9Sander M. German M.S. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 10Madsen O.D. Jensen J. Petersen H.V. Pedersen E.E. Oster A. Andersen F.G. Jorgensen M.C. Jensen P.B. Larsson L.I. Serup P. Horm. Metab. Res. 1997; 29: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In islets of diabetic animals and in long term culture of immortalized insulin-secreting cells, chronic exposure to high glucose can result in loss of insulin gene expression (11Zangen D.H. Bonner-Weir S. Lee C.H. Latimer J.B. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Weir G.C. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 12Olson L.K. Redmon J.B. Towle H.C. Robertson R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This loss is associated with reduced expression and/or activity of the β cell transcription factors PDX-1 and RIPE3b1 (11Zangen D.H. Bonner-Weir S. Lee C.H. Latimer J.B. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Weir G.C. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Sharma A. Olson L.K. Robertson R.P. Stein R. Mol.

Invest. 1998; 101: 2528-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and increased expression of the liver-adipocyte transcription factor C/EBPβ (14Seufert J. Weir G.C. Habener J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2528-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Similar alterations in gene expression have also been described in islets exposed in vitro for 2 days to high glucose and NEFA (15Gremlich S. Bonny C. Waeber G. Thorens B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30261-30269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). We have recently hypothesized that these changes in islet gene expression could reflect a loss of differentiation of β cells chronically exposed to the diabetic milieu, leading to further deterioration of β cell function and subsequent decreased secretory function (8Weir G.C. Sharma A. Zangen D.H. Bonner-Weir S. Acta Diabetol. 1997; 34: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested the influence of chronic hyperglycemia on pancreatic β cell differentiation, using a well characterized model of chronic hyperglycemia in the rat, the 90% partial pancreatectomy (Px) (16Bonner-Weir S. Trent D.F. Weir G.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 71: 1544-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). After an initial burst of pancreatic regeneration that lasts no longer than ∼10 days, these animals have a stable population of mature islets exposed to chronic hyperglycemia from 1st week post-Px (17Brockenbrough J.S. Weir G.C. Bonner-Weir S. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 232-236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Px rats are thus considered a model of β cell adaptation to increased secretory demand and exposure to the diabetic environment (5Leahy J.L. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 103-113Google Scholar). Our results show that graded levels of chronic hyperglycemiain vivo leads to progressive loss of β cell differentiation that can be reversed by normalization of blood glucose levels with phlorizin, in the absence of changes in plasma NEFA. They also suggest a link between stimulation of β cell growth and their reduced state of differentiation in hyperglycemic animals. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 90–100 g (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) were anesthetized with sodium amobarbital (10% solution, 1 ml/kg,) and submitted to a partial pancreatectomy or sham surgery as described previously (16Bonner-Weir S. Trent D.F. Weir G.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 71: 1544-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). For 90% pancreatectomy, most of the pancreatic tissue was removed by gentle abrasion with cotton applicators, leaving intact the tissue within 1–2 mm of the common bile duct and extending to the first loop of the duodenum (pancreatic remnant). In some experiments, the proportion of the gastric lobe removed was purposely varied to generate 85–95% partially pancreatectomized rats that stay normoglycemic or develop mild to severe hyperglycemia after Px. Blood was obtained weekly from the snipped tail of non-fasted rats (9–10 a.m.) in heparinized microcapillary tubes, and whole blood glucose levels were determined with a “One Touch II” glucometer (Lifescan, Milpitas, CA). Four weeks after Px, the rats were anesthetized with sodium amobarbital (10% solution, 1.1 ml/kg) and their islets isolated by collagenase digestion of the pancreatic remnants or the entire sham pancreas (11Zangen D.H. Bonner-Weir S. Lee C.H. Latimer J.B. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Weir G.C. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The islets were then microdissected and handpicked under a stereomicroscope to ensure high purity of the islet preparation. The islets were maintained on ice during the entire isolation except for 20 min of collagenase digestion. All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Joslin Diabetes Center. Most of the time, total RNA was extracted from islets of individual rats following manufacturer's suggested protocols using Ultraspec (Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX). In a few cases, however, it was necessary to pool islets from two Px rats with similar glycemia to have enough RNA for further analysis. After quantification by spectrophotometry, 500 ng of RNA was diluted to a final concentration of 0.1 μg/μl and heated at 85 °C for 3 min. It was then reverse-transcribed (RT) into cDNA in a 25-μl solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm dNTPs, 50 ng of random hexamers, and 200 units of Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C, 1 h at 42 °C, and 10 min at 95 °C. The final cDNA reaction products were then diluted with 50 μl of H2O to a concentration corresponding to 20 ng of starting RNA (20-ng RNA equivalents) per 3 μl and stored at −80 °C (18Jensen J. Serup P. Karlsen C. Nielsen T.F. Madsen O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18749-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Primer design was optimized for multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with EugeneTM version 2.2 (Daniben Systems, Cincinnati, OH) using the following restrictions: oligonucleotide length of 18–25 bases, GC content of 30–70%, melting temperature close to 60 °C, product length within 150–650 bases, and maximum 6–8 primer dimer formation allowed within multiplex PCR. Polymerization reactions were performed in a Perkin-Elmer 9600 or 9700 Thermocycler in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 3 μl of cDNA (20-ng RNA equivalents), 80–160 μm cold dNTPs, 2.5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 2.5–30 pmol of appropriate oligonucleotide primers, GeneAmp PCR buffer, and 5 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). The oligonucleotide primers and conditions used for multiplex PCR are indicated in TableI. The thermal cycle profile used was a 10-min denaturing step at 94 °C to release DNA polymerase activity (hot start PCR) followed by the number of cycles indicated in Table Iand a final extension step of 10 min at 72 °C. In each set, the gene products of interest were amplified with an internal control gene (cyclophilin, α-tubulin, the rat ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (RRPP0) or the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to correct for experimental variations between samples (RNA quantification, starting cDNA, gel loading, etc.). After removal of free [α-32P]dCTP by gel filtration on Probequant G50 microcolumns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the amplimers were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in Tris borate EDTA buffer. The gel was dried, and the amount of [α-32P]dCTP incorporated in each amplimer was measured with a PhosphorImager and quantified with the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The amount of each specific product was then expressed relative to the internal control, giving a ratio “specific product/control gene” for each sample. These ratios were then expressed as a percent of the ratio in sham islet extracts tested in the same RT-PCR. For each sample, a negative control (RT reaction performed in the absence of RT enzyme) was performed to exclude genomic DNA contamination of the cDNA.Table ISequences of oligonucleotide primers and PCR conditionsGene nameSize5′ Oligonucleotide3′ OligonucleotideGenBank™MgCl2dNTPPrimerAnnealingCyclesControl genebpaccession no.mmμmnm°CInsulin (I and II)148TCT TCT ACA CAC CCA TGT CCCGGT GCA GCA CTG ATC CACJ00747–81.5802005515CyclophilinSomatostatin194ATG CTG TCC TGC CGT CTCTTC TCT GTC TGG TTG GGC TCJ00786–901.580100–2005515–20CyclophilinGlucagon245ACC TAG ACT CCC GCC GTGATG TCT GCG CCC AAG TTCK028081.5802005515CyclophilinIAPP154CAA CCC TCA GGT GGA CAA ACCTC TGC CAC ATT CCT CTT CCM253901802005520CyclophilinAmylase198TGG CCT TCT GGA TCT TGCAAA GGT CTG CTT CCT TGG GM249621.5802005520CyclophilinGLUT2183TGG GTT CCT TCC AGT TCGAGG CGT CTG GTG TCG TAT GJ031451802005520CyclophilinGlucokinase, exon 1A299TGA CAG AGC CAG GAT GGA GTCT TCA CGC TCC ACT GCCM258071.5802005925α-TubulinHexokinase IaOligonucleotide primer sequences from Ref. 7.290GGC TCA GAG GAG ACC CTT CGCCA GGT CGA ACT TGA ATC ATJ032281.5802005530TBPmGPDH362AGA TTT CAC ATG TTT GAT GAA GAAG TCG TCT CTG GTT GTA CAT AU080271.5804005925α-TubulinLDH-A249ACA GTT GTT GGG GTT GGT GCCG GCT CTC TCC CTC TTGX019641.5802005924α-TubulinPyruvate carboxylase321GCC AAC AGA GGT GAG ATT GCC ATC CCAT CTT GCG GAC CAC CTC TGU365851.5802005528α-TubulinKir 6.2199CAT GGA GAA CGG TGT GGGCAG ATA GGA GGT GCG GGCU448971.5802005526RRPPOSUR1270ATC ACG GAA GGA GGG GAGTTC CGG CTT GTC GAA CTCL406241.5802005528α-TubulinVDCCα1D155TTC TCA GGG AAT GGA CGCAGC ACA TCT GTC CAG CCCD38101–21.5802005925α-TubulinSERCA3222GTA CCC CTA AGC GCC ACCAGC CAC CTC TGG TCT CGGJ050861–1.5802005520CyclophilinSERCA2B185CTC TAC GTG GAA CCT TTG CCAGG GAG CAG GAG GGT TTGJ040221.5802005520CyclophilinPDX-1 (Idx-1, IPF-1, Stf-1)169CGG ACA TCT CCC CAT ACGAAA GGG AGA TGA ACG CGGS674351.51602005520CyclophilinPDX-1 (exons 1 and 2)bFrom Ref. 14.349TGC TAA TCC CCC TGC GTG CCT GTACTC CTC CGG TTC TGC TGC GTA TGCS674351.51602005925α-TubulinNkx6.1cTATA-binding protein from Ref. 18.284TCT TCT GGC CTG GGG TGA TGGGC TGC GTG CTT CTT TCT CCAAF0044311.5802005526RRPPOPax6494GTC TAC CAG CCA ATT CCA CAG CCAG CCA TTT CTC TTT CTT TCC TU696441.5802005526RRPPOBeta2/NeuroD208GCA AAG GTT TGT CCC AGCACG TGG AAG ACG TGG GAGU280681.51602005520CyclophilinPAN1344AGG GCA GTG AAC GGA ATGGAA GGG GGA GGG GTA AGCX623231.51602005520CyclophilinIB1623CTG TGC CTC TGC CTC CTCTGA CAC CTA TCT TGA CAC CCC1.51602005925α-TubulinHNF1α173ATG AGC CGT CGT CTC CAGGTT GGA TGG CAG CAG GTGM952971.5804005924α-TubulinHNF4α1 and 2/5307/337TAC ATC AAC GAC CGG CAGGTG GAG TCT CAG GGG TGGD105541.5802005924α-TubulinHNF3β267GGC TCC TTC TGG ACC CTGACC TCG CTT GTG CTC CTGL096471.51606005925α-TubulinSP1265AAG CTC TTC AGG CCC TCCCTG CTG CTA GTC TGC CCCD127681.5802005525RRPPOc-myc237AGT TGG ACA GTG GCA GGGACA GGA TGT AGG CGG TGGY003961.5802005928TBPα-Tubulin451CTC GCA TCC ACT TCC CTCATG CCC TCA CCC ACG TACJ007971.580–16050–20055–59Cyclophilin400AAC CCC ACC GTG TTC TTCTGC CTT CTT TCA CCT TCC CM195331.580–16020055–59RRPPO375TCT CCC CCT TCT CCT TCGCTC CGA CTC TTC CTT TGCX150961.58020055Mouse TBPcTATA-binding protein from Ref. 18.190ACC CTT CAC CAA TGA CTC CTA TGATG ATG ACT GCA GCA AAT CGCD010341.58020055a Oligonucleotide primer sequences from Ref. 7Tokuyama Y.

Open table in a new tab To ensure the validity of the measurement of mRNA levels by semiquantitative-radioactive multiplex RT-PCR, control experiments were performed using normal rat islet cDNA to show that the amount of each amplimer obtained in a multiplex PCR was independent of the presence of the other primers (cross-correlation analysis), excluding the possibility of strong interferences between primers. The number of cycles (1 min denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min at annealing temperature, and 1 min extension at 72 °C) and the final reaction conditions (MgCl2, cold dNTP and primer concentrations, cycle number, and annealing temperature) were then adjusted to be in the exponential phase of the amplification of each product (Fig.1 A). Finally, we verified that the amount of each PCR product in a multiplex reaction increases linearly with the amount of starting cDNA (from 2.5- to 80-ng RNA equivalents), ensuring that changes in the ratio of PCR product to control gene product truly reflect a change in mRNA abundance of that gene relative to the control gene (Fig. 1 B). Our results (PCR amplification and quantitation) were highly reproducible, as judged by multiple PCR determination from the same cDNA preparation (coefficient of variation <7%). In the first part of the study, rats sacrificed after 4 weeks were classified into 4 groups according to their averaged fed blood glucose levels 3 and 4 weeks post-Px. Low hyperglycemic rats (LPx) were below 100 mg/dl, mildly hyperglycemic rats (MPx) were within 100–150 mg/dl, highly hyperglycemic rats (HPx) were within 150–250 mg/dl, and severely hyperglycemic rats (SPx) were above 250 mg/dl (range in mm are <5.6, 5.6–8.3, 8.3–13.9 and >13.9 respectively). In the second part of the study, Px rats were classified according to their averaged fed blood glucose levels 1 and 2 weeks post-Px in moderately hyperglycemic (<160 mg/dl) and severely hyperglycemic (≥160 mg/dl) rats. Severely hyperglycemic Px rats were then divided in 3 groups. The first one was sacrificed 2 weeks after Px, and the other two were randomly assigned to phlorizin treatment or no treatment for the next 2 weeks. Phlorizin was dissolved in 1,2-propanediol (0.2 g/ml) and injected intraperitoneally twice a day at a dose of 0.8 g per kg body weight per day for 2 weeks (19Barrera-Hernandez G. Wanke I.E. Wong N.C. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1217-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Sham animals received similar amounts of 1,2-propanediol as phlorizin-treated rats. To make sure that blood glucose levels were normalized throughout the day, blood sampling was always performed just before injection of the morning dose of phlorizin. Plasma was prepared from blood samples collected in EDTA/paraoxon (diethyl-para-nitrophenyl phosphate)-coated tubes, to avoid heparin stimulation of triglyceride lipase and breakdown of circulating triglycerides to glycerol and NEFA (20Zambon A. Hashimoto S.I. Brunzell J.D. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1021-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma insulin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay for rat insulin (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Plasma NEFA levels were measured by a colorimetric method (Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany). Remnant tissue from 4-week Px (treated with or without phlorizin for the last 2 weeks) and remnant equivalent from sham Px (at least 4 rats in each group) was fixed for 2 h at room temperature in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1m phosphate buffer and then processed for paraffin embedding. For staining of transcription factors, paraffin sections (5–7 μm) were deparaffinized and then microwaved in citrate buffer (3 times, each for 5 min) for antigen retrieval. Sections from all blocks were then rinsed in Tris saline, incubated for 10–20 min in 0.3% Triton X-100 (Fisher) with 1% lamb serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), and following a second rinse, incubated in rabbit blocking serum (Vector, Burlingame, CA). Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with Nkx6.1 antibody (gift of Palle Serup, Hagedorn, Gentofe, DK, dilution 1:2000). After washing, sections were incubated 1 h at room temperature with donkey biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1:400, Jackson ImmunoResearch) as the secondary antibody followed by streptavidin-conjugated FITC (1:400, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing extensively, slides were mounted with DABCO glycerol anti-fading mounting media. Images of stained sections were taken on a Zeiss LSM 410 microscope with a fluorescence filter for FITC. The sections were then washed with 0.01 mmHCl to remove the attached antibodies, rinsed with distilled water, and incubated with 5% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 30 min at room temperature. The staining procedure was repeated on the same sections with PDX-1 primary antibody overnight (Hm-253, gift of Joel Habener, Boston, dilution 1:7500) and donkey biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1:400, Jackson ImmunoResearch) as the secondary antibody followed by streptavidin-conjugated Texas Red (1:400, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Images of stained sections were taken with a fluorescence filter for Texas Red. Similar results were obtained with sections not previously stained for Nkx6.1. Control serum of appropriate species gave no cross-reactions. Sections from Px and sham pancreas were stained and photographed in parallel and at the same settings. Adobe Photoshop was used to make final figures. For lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) immunolocalization, deparaffinized non-microwaved sections were soaked in phosphate-buffered saline plus 1% lamb serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated overnight with a rabbit anti-rat liver LDH antibody (final dilution 1:250, gift of Dr. A. Völkl, Heidelberg, Germany) that recognizes the A4- and A3B isoforms (21Baumgart E. Fahimi H.D. Stich A. Volkl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3846-3855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Pancreatic β cells mainly express the liver isoform 5 of LDH, a tetramer of LDH-A (LDH-A4) (22Sekine N. Cirulli V. Regazzi R. Brown L.J. Gine E. Tamarit-Rodriguez J. Girotti M. Marie S. MacDonald M.J. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4895-4902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C, washed with Tris buffer (pH 7.4), sequentially incubated with goat anti-rabbit Ig and rabbit peroxidase anti-peroxidase conjugate (Cappel Laboratories, Cochranville, PA), stained with diaminobenzidene, and counterstained with hematoxylin. By using this procedure on liver sections, we found the expected staining pattern of LDH (21Baumgart E. Fahimi H.D. Stich A. Volkl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3846-3855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In another set of experiments, 4-week Px (treated or not with phlorizin) and sham islets were isolated, pelleted, and fixed for 2 h at room temperature in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer and then processed for plastic embedding. After resin removal, the sections (1 μm) were soaked in phosphate-buffered saline plus 1% lamb serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and stained for the endocrine non-β cells using a mixture of antibodies as follows: rabbit anti-bovine glucagon (final dilution 1:3000, gift of Dr. M. Appel), rabbit anti-synthetic somatostatin (final dilution 1:300, made in our own laboratory), and rabbit anti-bovine pancreatic polypeptide (final dilution 1:3000, gift of Dr. R. Chance, Lilly, Indianapolis). The sections were incubated with this mixture of antibodies 40 h at 4 °C and processed as described above for LDH staining. These sections were then used to evaluate β to non-β cell ratio in isolated islets. Islet pellets were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mphosphate buffer and processed for routine electron microscopy. Fifteen micrographs of each of two randomly picked islets per sample were taken at a magnification of 3800 with a Philips 301 electron microscope. β cell cross-sectional area was determined on β cells with a visible nucleus (64–120 cells/animal) by planimetry using the IPLab Spectrum image analysis software (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA). β cell volume was estimated from these values using the formula for volume of sphere. Results are presented as means ± S.E. for the indicated number of animals or islet preparations. Statistical significance of differences between Px and sham groups was assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by a test of Dunnett for comparison with sham or by a test of Newman-Keuls for multiple comparisons. For immunohistochemistry data, representative islets from different type of animals are presented. The evolution of body weight and fed blood glucose levels after Px are illustrated in Fig.2. During the first few days after surgery, body weight gain was slightly decreased in Px rats, resulting at 1 week in a statistically significantly lower body weight in all groups of Px versus sham. Thereafter, Px animals gained weight at the same rate as sham. In contrast, changes in blood glucose were very heterogeneous among Px animals, due to deliberate, but slight, variation in the amount of pancreas removed (∼85–95% Px). Three and four weeks after Px, blood glucose ranged from 68 to 317 and 72 to 336 mg/dl, respectively, whereas sham blood glucose varied from 63 to 87 and 64 to 96 mg/dl at the same time points. These values were determined on whole blood obtained in the morning from fed animals. They are lower than the corresponding plasma glucose values determined by the glucose oxidase method that range from 120 mg/dl in sham to 450–500 mg/dl in Px animals. Px rats were then classified according to their averaged blood glucose at 3 and 4 weeks post-Px as low (LPx), mildly (MPx), highly (HPx), and severely hyperglycemic (SPx) rats (see “Experimental Procedures” and TablesII and IIIfor classification criteria). The blood glucose of SPx rats was significantly increased already by 1 week and remained significantly higher than in any other group during the entire study (Fig. 2). MPx and HPx blood glucose values were not different from sham at 1 week but increased significantly thereafter. Although these two groups could not be distinguished from each other at 2 weeks, they were significantly different 3 and 4 weeks after Px. LPx blood glucose was slightly, but not significantly, increased over sham at any time during this study.Table IIChanges in pancreatic islet gene mRNA levels in rats with different degree of hyperglycemia 4 weeks after PxGroup classification criteriaSham, n = 11LPx, <100 mg/dl,n = 18MPx, 100–150 mg/dl, n = 10HPx, 150–250 mg/dl, n = 4SPx, >250 mg/dl, n= 6Blood glucose (mg/dl)aAveraged blood glucose values 3 and 4 weeks post-Px.76 ± 2.484 ± 2.0112 ± 2.7bp < 0.01 versus sham by test of Dunnett after one-way ANOVA.192 ± 11.3bp < 0.01 versus sham by test of Dunnett after one-way ANOVA.285 ± 11.4bp < 0.01 versus sham by test of Dunnett after one-way ANOVA.Islet hormonesInsulin (I + II)100 ± 3.092 ± 4.1107 ± 12.550 ± 7.7bp < 0.01 versus sham by test of Dunnett after one-way ANOVA.51 ± 5.6bp < 0.01 versus sham by test of Dunnett after one-way ANOVA.IAPP100 ± 3.7121 ± 4.3cp < 0.05 versus sham by test of Dunnett after one way ANOVA.112 ± 5.883 ± 7.171 ± 13.0cp < 0.05 versus sh"
https://openalex.org/W2053081403,"A new lipoprotein lipase-like gene has been cloned from endothelial cells through a subtraction methodology aimed at characterizing genes that are expressed with in vitro differentiation of this cell type. The conceptual endothelial cell-derived lipase protein contains 500 amino acids, including an 18-amino acid hydrophobic signal sequence, and is 44% identical to lipoprotein lipase and 41% identical to hepatic lipase. Comparison of primary sequence to that of lipoprotein and hepatic lipase reveals conservation of the serine, aspartic acid, and histidine catalytic residues as well as the 10 cysteine residues involved in disulfide bond formation. Expression was identified in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human coronary artery endothelial cells, and murine endothelial-like yolk sac cells by Northern blot. In addition, Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis revealed expression of the endothelial-derived lipase in placenta, liver, lung, ovary, thyroid gland, and testis. A c-Myc-tagged protein secreted from transfected COS7 cells had phospholipase A1 activity but no triglyceride lipase activity. Its tissue-restricted pattern of expression and its ability to be expressed by endothelial cells, suggests that endothelial cell-derived lipase may have unique functions in lipoprotein metabolism and in vascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2008479138,"The concerted action of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and Ca2+ on the IP3 receptor Ca2+ release channel (IP3R) is a fundamental step in the generation of cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations and waves, which underlie Ca2+ signaling in many cells. Mitochondria appear in close association with regions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enriched in IP3R and are particularly responsive to IP3-induced increases of cytosolic Ca2+([Ca2+]c). To determine whether feedback regulation of the IP3R by released Ca2+ is modulated by mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, the interactions between ER and mitochondrial Ca2+ pools were examined by fluorescence imaging of compartmentalized Ca2+ indicators in permeabilized hepatocytes. IP3 decreased luminal ER Ca2+ ([Ca2+]ER), and this was paralleled by an increase in mitochondrial matrix Ca2+([Ca2+]m) and activation of Ca2+-sensitive mitochondrial metabolism. Remarkably, the decrease in [Ca2+]ER evoked by submaximal IP3 was enhanced when mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was blocked with ruthenium red or uncoupler. Moreover, subcellular regions that were relatively deficient in mitochondria demonstrated greater sensitivity to IP3 than regions of the cell with a high density of mitochondria. These data demonstrate that Ca2+ uptake by the mitochondria suppresses the local positive feedback effects of Ca2+ on the IP3R, giving rise to subcellular heterogeneity in IP3 sensitivity and IP3R excitability. Thus, mitochondria can play an important role in setting the threshold for activation and establishing the subcellular pattern of IP3-dependent [Ca2+]c signaling.

Moreover, our data demonstrate that the mitochondrial modulation of IP3-induced Ca2+ release is limited to those elements of the ER Ca2+ stores in proximity with the mitochondria, giving rise to subcellular heterogeneity in IP3 sensitivity and IP3R excitability. These properties allow the mitochondria to play a key role in orchestrating the subcellular pattern of [Ca2+]c signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHepatocytes plated on polylysine-coated coverslips were maintained in primary culture for 18–24 h (15Hajnóczky G.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3533-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Cytosolic [Ca2+] waves in fura2-loaded intact hepatocytes were measured essentially as described previously (15Hajnóczky G.

Chem. 1990; 18: 10792-10796Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The cells were stimulated with vasopressin (2–20 nm) prior to and after addition of mitochondrial inhibitors or solvent in sequential runs, and the rate of wave propagation was determined in each condition (15Hajnóczky G.

For permeabilized cell experiments, cells were loaded with fluorescent dyes (obtained from Molecular Probes or Teflabs) by incubation for 30–60 min at 37 °C in medium composed of 121 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm Na-HEPES, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm Mg2SO4, 2 mmCaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, essentially as described previously (9Hajnóczky G. Thomas A.P. Nature. 1994; 370: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 15Hajnóczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P.

Dye concentrations were: 150 nm MitoTracker Green, 2 μm rhod2/AM, 5 μm fura2FF/AM, and 5 μm fluo3FF/AM. We have shown previously that compartmentalization of rhod2 occurs in the mitochondria (15Hajnóczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar) and fura2FF is trapped in the ER (26Hajnóczky G. Thomas A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3533-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) of hepatocytes using this loading protocol. Dye-loaded cells were washed with Ca2+-free buffer and then permeabilized by incubation for 6 min with 15 μg/ml digitonin in intracellular medium (ICM) composed of 120 mmKCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mmKH2PO4, 20 mm Tris-HEPES at pH 7.2 with 2 mm MgATP and 1 μg/ml each of antipain, leupeptin, and pepstatin. ICM was passed through a Chelex column prior to addition of ATP and protease inhibitors to lower the ambient [Ca2+]. Labeling of cells with CaGreenC18 (2.5 μm) was carried out during permeabilization. After permeabilization, the cells were washed into fresh buffer without digitonin and incubated in the imaging chamber, at 35 °C. Digital image time series were obtained using a Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal microscope equipped for dual emission or a Photometrics cooled CCD camera system using a filter wheel and multiwavelength beamsplitter/emission filter combination that allows simultaneous measurement of fura2FF and rhod2 fluorescence. Calibration of fura2FF signals in permeabilized hepatocytes gave values of 300–1000 μm for [Ca2+]ER(K d = 35 μm, A. Minta, TEFLABS) (26Hajnóczky G. Thomas A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3533-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of rhod2 (Frhod2), CaGreenC18 (FCaGr), and NAD(P)H (FNAD(P)H) are expressed as arbitrary units. The fluorescence of rhod2 and CaGreenC18 was not calibrated in terms of absolute [Ca2+], because these are not ratiometric dyes, and photobleaching resulted in a gradual decrease of fluorescence during confocal imaging measurements.Experiments were carried out with at least three different cell preparations. Traces represent single cell responses unless indicated otherwise. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. Significance of differences from the relevant controls was calculated by Student'st test.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn previous studies we have demonstrated that global application of IP3 to permeabilized hepatocytes results in oscillatory release and reuptake of [Ca2+]ER and that this reproduces the basic mechanism of [Ca2+]coscillations in intact cells treated with hormones (26Hajnóczky G. Thomas A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3533-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We have used a similar approach to examine the interactions between mitochondrial and ER Ca2+ stores. [Ca2+]m was monitored with compartmentalized rhod2 (15Hajnóczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 28Simpson P.B. Russell J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33493-33501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Double labeling with the vital mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Green (29Haughland R.P. Spence M.T.Z. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR1996: 266-271Google Scholar) demonstrated that rhod2 fluorescence was completely coincident with the mitochondria in permeabilized hepatocytes (Fig.1 A). Moreover, the [Ca2+]m decrease elicited by uncoupler was manifest in a reduction of rhod2 fluorescence for all of the intracellular structures that were double labeled with MitoTracker (compare overlay panels iii and iv of Fig.1 A), showing that rhod2 selectively monitors [Ca2+]m in this preparation. To determine whether IP3-induced Ca2+ release led to an increase in [Ca2+]m, we used compartmentalized rhod2 to monitor [Ca2+]m while simultaneously measuring Ca2+ release from the ER. To follow IP3-induced Ca2+ release, [Ca2+]ER was measured with low affinity Ca2+ indicators (fura2FF and fluo3FF) as described previously (26Hajnóczky G. Thomas A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3533-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As an alternative approach, Ca2+ at the cytosolic face of intracellular membranes ([Ca2+]memb) was measured with the lipophilic indicator CaGreenC18 (30Tanimura A. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30904-30908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). CaGreenC18 labeled membranes throughout the cell, apart from the nuclear matrix, whereas MitoTracker Red fluorescence was predominantly perinuclear, consistent with the subcellular location of mitochondria in these cells (Fig.1 B). This differential distribution is also shown in the overlaid CaGreenC18 and rhod2 dual label images of Fig. 1 C. A similar global distribution of the ER Ca2+ stores was observed with fluo3FF or fura2FF, and the perinuclear organization of the mitochondria was also demonstrated based on pyridine nucleotide fluorescence and the alkaline pH of the mitochondrial matrix (see Fig.3).Figure 3Subcellular organization of mitochondrial control over IP3-induced [Ca2+]ERmobilization. A, the spatial organization of IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores in individual hepatocytes was determined by confocal imaging measurements of [Ca2+]ER in fluo3FF-loaded permeabilized hepatocytes. panel i shows the initial pattern of fluo3FF labeling, and panel ii shows the difference image (purple) for the effect of 12.5 μmIP3, calculated by subtraction of the image of IP3-treated cells from the initial control image. The localization of mitochondria in these cells was determined by subsequent labeling with 150 nm fluorescein diacetate (panel iii). B, comparison of mitochondrial distribution with the spatial pattern of IP3-induced [Ca2+]ER decreases. Gray scale images show the fluorescence of compartmentalized fura2FF (380 nm excitation) in the permeabilized hepatocytes. The yellow overlay of panel ii shows the NAD(P)H fluorescence change induced by addition of 20 mm β-hydroxybutyrate. The IP3-induced increase of [Ca2+]mhad no further effect on NAD(P)H fluorescence after reduction in the presence of β-hydroxybutyrate. Moreover, the NAD(P)H signals canceled out in the ratiometric fura2FF measurements of [Ca2+]ER. The purple overlays show the fluorescence changes calculated by subtraction of sequential images, giving a differential display of the spatial distribution of IP3-induced [Ca2+]ER decrease at each time point (15Hajnóczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 26Hajnóczky G. Thomas A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3533-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The cells were treated sequentially with IP3 concentrations of 100 nm and 12.5 μm. Time courses of [Ca2+]ERchange in cells 1 and 2 (panel i) for domains with high (traces 1A and 2A) and low (traces 1Band 2B) mitochondrial density are shown below theupper row of images. Panels v–vii show a time series for the [Ca2+]ER wave recorded in cell 3. C, effect of mitochondrial inhibitors on the spatial pattern of IP3-induced [Ca2+]ERdecreases. Responses of [Ca2+]ER to IP3 (150 nm) were recorded in the absence and presence of FCCP + oligomycin (5 μg/ml each) in sequential runs. To achieve consistent release responses, IP3 was added together with the Ca2+ pump inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid (100 μm), which was washed out between the stimulations. The purple overlays show the fluorescence changes calculated by subtraction of the images obtained before and after IP3treatment for each condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Intracellular stores were loaded with Ca2+ by incubating the permeabilized cells in the presence of ATP without Ca2+buffers, essentially as described previously (26Hajnóczky G. Thomas A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3533-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Addition of maximal IP3 to cells loaded with CaGreenC18 and rhod2 resulted in rapid Ca2+ release that was detected as an increase in [Ca2+]memb and a simultaneous increase in [Ca2+]m (Fig. 1 D). Nevertheless, the CaGreenC18 and rhod2 signals responded differently to uncoupler, which selectively reduced [Ca2+]m (not shown). The IP3-induced decrease in [Ca2+]ERcould be monitored directly with luminal fura2FF (26Hajnóczky G. Thomas A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3533-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and this was also accompanied by a rapid increase in [Ca2+]mmeasured simultaneously with rhod2 (Fig. 1 E). At the maximal levels of IP3 used in Fig. 1 E, the ER remained depleted of Ca2+, but [Ca2+]mdeclined after the peak, as reported previously for [Ca2+]m in intact cells stimulated with a maximal dose of hormone (15Hajnóczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Addition of heparin to block the IP3receptor allowed recovery of [Ca2+]ER with essentially no effect on [Ca2+]m, whereas addition of uncoupler to collapse the mitochondrial membrane potential caused [Ca2+]m to decrease without affecting [Ca2+]ER (Fig. 1 E). The residual ER Ca2+ could be released with ionophore. Several intramitochondrial dehydrogenases are activated by elevated [Ca2+]m (31McCormack J.G. Halestrap A.P. Denton R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 391-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar), and this activation can be monitored fluorometrically through changes in pyridine nucleotide redox state in intact hepatocytes (15Hajnóczky G.

Fig. 1 F shows that the IP3-induced Ca2+ release led to an increase in NAD(P)H fluorescence in permeabilized hepatocytes, reflecting the Ca2+-dependent dehydrogenase activation. Taken together, the data of Fig. 1 demonstrate that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and the consequent regulation of intramitochondrial metabolism is coupled to IP3-induced Ca2+ release from the ER in permeabilized hepatocytes. Because the Ca2+ released by IP3 plays a key role in both positive and negative feedback regulation of the IP3 receptor Ca2+ channel (5Iino M. J. Gen.

Nature. 1994; 370: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we used this system to investigate whether mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake modulates IP3-induced Ca2+ release.The [Ca2+]ER decrease elicited by submaximal and maximal IP3 was measured under the conditions described above, where the mitochondria were able to take up part of the released Ca2+, and compared with conditions where mitochondrial Ca2+, uptake was blocked with ruthenium red or uncoupler (Fig. 2). These inhibitors affect neither the steady state [Ca2+]c nor the amount of Ca2+ released by IP3 in liver microsomes, suggesting that they have no direct effect on Ca2+ release from ER in hepatocytes (33Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 858-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 34Lukács G.L. Hajnóczky G. Hunyady L. Spät A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 931: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the mitochondrial blockers removed a sink for the released Ca2+, the extent of ER Ca2+ release at submaximal IP3 was actually increased in the presence of ruthenium red or uncoupler (Fig. 2 A). Under the experimental conditions used in Fig. 2 A, the Ca2+ release response to 100 nm IP3 was increased from 8.6 ± 1.8% under control conditions to 12.1 ± 1.6% in the presence of ruthenium red (p < 0.01, n= 4). This did not reflect a change in the size of the releasable ER Ca2+ store, because there was no significant difference in the extent of Ca2+ release in response to maximal IP3 (Fig. 2 A; 25.3 ± 3.5 and 25.1 ± 2.8% in the absence and presence of ruthenium red, respectively;n = 4).Figure 2Effects of ruthenium red and mitochondrial uncoupling on IP 3 -induced decreases of [Ca2+]ER. Fura2FF-loaded hepatocytes were permeabilized and incubated in ICM (A) or ICM supplemented with 10 mm BAPTA and 7 mmCaCl2 (B), supplemented with 1 μmruthenium red (RuRed, red trace), 5 μg/ml uncoupler 1799 plus 5 μg/ml oligomycin (Uncoupler,blue trace), or no additions (control,black trace). The [Ca2+]ERdecrease in response to sequential treatments with 100 nmand 25 μm IP3 was then determined. The mean traces are from separate runs using cells from the same preparation and are averaged from the entire cell population in the imaging field (30–50 cells).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We hypothesized that the paradoxical increased efficacy of submaximal IP3 to release Ca2+ when the mitochondria are no longer available to act as a sink for this released Ca2+reflects the feedback effects of Ca2+ on the IP3R. To examine this possibility, we repeated the experiments of Fig. 2 A in the presence of BAPTA to clamp [Ca2+]c at the prestimulation level and prevent local feedback regulation by [Ca2+]c. The [Ca2+]ER decrease in response to submaximal IP3 was smaller in the presence of BAPTA, presumably because the positive feedback effects of [Ca2+]cwere prevented (Fig. 2 B). Alternatively, this may be explained by a decrease in IP3 sensitivity due to the pharmacological effect of BAPTA (35Richardson A. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11528-11533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More importantly, the potentiation by mitochondrial inhibitors at submaximal IP3was completely eliminated when the Ca-BAPTA buffer was included. Thus, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in the immediate vicinity of the IP3-activated Ca2+ release sites can suppress the positive feedback effects of released Ca2+ that would otherwise facilitate activation of neighboring IP3Rs.The data of Fig. 2 were averaged over a number of cells in the imaging field. However, because mitochondria show a perinuclear distribution in individual hepatocytes, it might be expected that the modulation of IP3-induced Ca2+ release would occur heterogeneously at the subcellular level. The confocal image of Fig.3 A (panel i) shows that the entire reticular network is labeled with compartmentalized fluo3FF in permeabilized hepatocytes. The decrease of [Ca2+]ER in response to maximal IP3 occurred homogeneously throughout each cell, apart from the nuclear matrix, as shown by the difference image of Fig.3 A (panel ii). By contrast, subsequent staining of the mitochondria with the pH-sensitive dye fluorescein diacetate revealed the more centralized mitochondrial distribution (Fig.3 A, panel iii). Thus, although the IP3-sensitive Ca2+ store appears to be distributed throughout the hepatocyte, the modulation of IP3 sensitivity by the mitochondria may occur predominately in the central domain of each cell. Evidence in support of this is shown in Fig. 3 B, where the spatial pattern of [Ca2+]ER decrease evoked by submaximal and maximal IP3 is compared with the distribution of the mitochondria. Compartmentalized fura2FF was used to monitor [Ca2+]ER (Fig. 3 B, panel i), and the mitochondria were localized functionally by their redox response to the mitochondrial substrate β-hydroxybutyrate (yellow overlay in Fig. 3 B, panel ii). The functional mitochondria showed the same perinuclear distribution observed with other techniques in Figs. 1 and 3 A. Addition of 100 nm IP3 elicited a partial decrease of [Ca2+]ER (purple overlays) in cells 1 and 2, and this response was larger in the peripheral regions than in the central domains where the mitochondria were located (compare panels ii and iii of Fig.3 B). By contrast, subsequent addition of maximal IP3 elicited a larger decrease in [Ca2+]ER in the mitochondria-rich domains of these cells (Fig. 3 B, panel iv), which primarily reflects the prior depletion of peripheral [Ca2+]ER by the submaximal IP3dose. Time courses of [Ca2+]ER change in cells 1 and 2 are shown below the images of Fig. 3 B(panels i–iv) for regions with high mitochondrial density (traces 1A and 1B) and for regions that were relatively deficient in mitochondria (traces 1B and 2B).Similar differences in IP3 sensitivity between regions with high and low mitochondrial density were observed in every cell in the imaging field, but because the responses were asynchronous they do not all show in the images. In addition, some cells gave [Ca2+]ER oscillations and waves at submaximal IP3 (26Hajnóczky G. Thomas A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3533-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). For cell 3 of Fig. 3 B, addition of 100 nm IP3 did not cause an immediate Ca2+ release. Instead, the [Ca2+]ER decrease elicited in cell 2 propagated into cell 3 as a slow wave of Ca2+ release (not shown). Significantly, the greatest magnitude and rate of [Ca2+]ER decrease occurred in the distal part of cell 3, which was largely devoid of mitochondria. [Ca2+]ER recovered in this oscillating cell and then after about 90 s in the continuing presence of 100 nm IP3 there was a second wave of [Ca2+]ER decrease that was intrinsic to cell 3. This intrinsic [Ca2+]ER wave propagated fro"

Diabet. 1997; 105: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The two naturally occurring and biologically active isopeptides of GLP-1 with therapeutic potential are GLP-1-(7–37) and GLP-1-(7–36)amide (3Fehmann H.-C. Goke R. Goke B. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 390-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 4Drucker D.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 159-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are derived by post-translational processing of proglucagon, and are synthesized and secreted by enteroendocrine l-cells of the distal intestine. The timing of the secretion of GLP-1 from these cells is such that circulating levels of the hormone rise coincident with the postprandial increase of blood glucose concentration. By binding to its receptors located on β-cells, GLP-1 synergizes with glucose to induce insulin secretion, thereby increasing the concentration of circulating insulin to a level above that attributable to glucose alone. This augmentation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by the gut hormone GLP-1 is termed the incretin effect and plays a critical role in the maintenance of systemic glucose homeostasis (5Kreyman B. Williams G. Ghatei M.A. Bloom S.R. Lancet. 1987; 2: 1300-1303Abstract PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). The GLP-1 receptor located on β-cells is a G protein-coupled receptor that mediates stimulatory effects of the hormone on adenylyl cyclase (6Thorens B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8641-8645Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). GLP-1 raises intracellular levels of cyclic cAMP, activates protein kinase A (PKA), and exerts pleiotropic effects on β-cell signal transduction (7Holz G.G. Habener J.F. Trends Biochem.

The best evidence available indicates that the GLP-1-induced rise of [Ca2+]i serves as an important trigger for exocytosis of insulin. The vital role Ca2+plays in this process is emphasized by studies demonstrating that the insulin secretagogic effect of GLP-1 is markedly attenuated by treatments that prevent the rise of [Ca2+]i (16Lu M. Wheeler M.B. Leng X.H. Boyd III, A.E. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 24Fridolf T. Ahren B. Diabetes Res. 1991; 16: 185-191PubMed Google Scholar). We have focused on early events in GLP-1 signal transduction in order to ascertain how the rise of [Ca2+]i that serves as a trigger for secretion of insulin is achieved. In general, the alterations of [Ca2+]i observed upon exposure of β-cells to GLP-1 can be described as having transient (seconds) or sustained (minutes) kinetics. The sustained rise of [Ca2+]i results from influx of Ca2+ that is a consequence of three distinct mechanisms. First, GLP-1 potentiates glucose-induced closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (K-ATP) (13Holz G.G. Kuhtreiber W.M. Habener J.F. Nature. 1993; 361: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), thereby generating cellular depolarization, activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs), and influx of Ca2+. Second, GLP-1 exerts a direct stimulatory influence on the entry of Ca2+ through dihydropyridine-sensitive (l-type) VDCCs (9Gromada J. Holst J.J. Rorsman P. Pflugers Arch. 1998; 435: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Third, GLP-1 stimulates the opening of Ca2+-activated nonselective cation channels that are permeant to Ca2+ as well as to Na+ (14Holz G.G. Leech C.A. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17749-17757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 25Leech C.A. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17987-17993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These three processes act in concert to augment oscillatory electrical activity, Ca2+ influx, and pulsatile secretion of insulin characteristic of whole islets of Langerhans. More poorly understood is the fast transient increase of [Ca2+]i observed in response to GLP-1 (18Yada T. Itoh K. Nakata M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1685-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Cullinan C.A. Brady E.J. Saperstein R. Leibowitz M.D. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here we report that this action of the hormone requires the presence of extracellular Ca2+, can occur independent of any change of membrane potential, and is reproduced by pharmacological activators of cAMP signaling. Typically, such transient effects of hormones on [Ca2+]i are considered to be a consequence of the mobilization of Ca2+stores. GLP-1 might stimulate release of inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive Ca2+ stores because it increases inositol phosphate production in COS-7 cells transfected with the recombinant GLP-1 receptor (26Wheeler M.B. Lu M. Dillon J.S. Leng X.H. Chen C. Boyd A.E. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) or in Xenopus oocytes injected with GLP-1 receptor mRNA (27Gromada J. Anker C. Bokvist K. Knudsen L.B. Wahl P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, GLP-1 has only a small effect on inositol phosphate production in freshly isolated islets (24Fridolf T. Ahren B. Diabetes Res. 1991; 16: 185-191PubMed Google Scholar, 28Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Rasmussen H. Regul. Pept. 1992; 44: 277-283Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or HIT-T15 insulinoma cells (16Lu M. Wheeler M.B. Leng X.H. Boyd III, A.E. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, an issue of central importance to our understanding of GLP-1 signal transduction concerns exactly how cAMP interacts with β-cell Ca2+stores to promote their mobilization. It has been proposed that Ca2+ is mobilized by GLP-1 during the process of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR), whereby influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane triggers release of Ca2+ from Ca2+ stores regulated by ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channels (20Gromada J.S. Dissing K. Bokvist K. Renstrom E. Frokjaer-Jensen J. Wulff B.S. Rorsman P. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is controversial due to conflicting findings concerning what role ryanodine receptors play as regulators of β-cell Ca2+ signaling. One objection raised concerns the uncertain effectiveness of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) in this system. cADPR is a candidate second messenger that mobilizes ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores in some cell types (29Galione A. Science. 1993; 259: 325-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). It is derived from β-NAD+ via an enzymatic process catalyzed by an ADP-ribosyl cyclase designated CD38 (30Koguma T. Takasawa S. Tohgo A. Karasawa T. Furuya Y. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1223: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Okamoto and co-workers reported that an IP3-insensitive Ca2+ store was mobilized by cADPR in rat islet microsomes (31Takasawa S. Nata K. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. Science. 1993; 259: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 32Okamoto H. Takasawa S. Nata K. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 1485-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 33Takasawa S.

However, cADPR failed to act in ob/ob mouse β-cells or RINm5F insulinoma cells (34Islam M.S. Larsson O. Berggren P.O.

Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 1480-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Ca2+ signaling in rat β-cells was also not influenced by an antagonist of cADPR (37Webb D.L. Islam M.S. Efanov A.M.

Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and levels of cADPR in rat islets were insensitive to alterations of glucose concentration (40Malaisse W.J. Kanda Y. Inageda K. Scruel O. Sener A. Katada T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), findings that contradict the Okamoto hypothesis. Therefore, the significance of ryanodine receptors as mediators of GLP-1 signal transduction remained unclear. Here we report functional expression of ryanodine receptors in β-cells derived from human, rat, and C57BL/6J mouse islets. Assays of islet mRNA by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) indicated a preferential expression of the type 2 isoform of ryanodine receptor (RYR2) in these tissues. The subcellular location of ryanodine receptors was visualized in β-cells by fluorescence microscopy using BODIPY FL-X ryanodine as a fluorophore. Ca2+ imaging and patch clamp analyses of β-cells demonstrated that GLP-1 produces a fast transient increase of [Ca2+]i as a consequence of CICR initiated by influx of Ca2+ through l-type VDCCs. It is concluded that this process of CICR is mediated by a cAMP-signaling system that targets a ryanodine-sensitive source of intracellular Ca2+. Human islets were obtained from Dr. C. Ricordi (Diabetes Research Institute, University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL). Rat islets were isolated from pentobarbital-anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) according Lacy and Kostianovsky (41Lacy P.E. Kostianovsky M. Diabetes. 1967; 16: 335-337Crossref Scopus (2473) Google Scholar) by digestion with collagenase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Mouse islets were isolated by digestion of pancreata obtained from male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). Islets were dispersed into single cell suspensions by digestion with trypsin-EDTA, and by trituration through a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. Cell suspensions were plated onto glass coverslips (25CIR-1; Fisher) coated with 1 mg/ml concanavalin A (type V; Sigma), which facilitates adherence of β-cells to glass surfaces. Cell cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator (95% air, 5% CO2) at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 culture media containing 11.1 mm glucose, 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. BTC3 and BTC6 cells (passages 62–78 and 24–34, respectively) were obtained from Dr. S. Efrat (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY). MIN6 cells (passages 25–35) were provided by J. Miyazaki (Kyoto University, Japan). HIT-T15 cells (passages 65–70) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cell cultures were maintained on plastic tissue culture dishes (Falcon 3003; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) containing media supplemented with 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. BTC3 and BTC6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 15% heat-inactivated horse serum, and 2.5% FBS. MIN6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium composed of 25 mm glucose, 15% FBS, and 74 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. HIT-T15 cells were maintained in Ham's F-12K medium containing 10 mm glucose, 10% horse serum, and 2.5% FBS. Total RNA was extracted from rat islets and insulinoma cell cultures using guanidinium thiocyanate. The RNA was fractionated by density gradient centrifugation on a CsCl cushion, and poly(A) mRNA was isolated by chromatographic separation on an oligo(dT) affinity column. First strand cDNA synthesis was initiated using oligo(dT) primers and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Copy Kit; Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). A cDNA synthesis reaction to which no reverse transcriptase was added served as a negative control. PCR primer pairs corresponding to RYR isoforms were identified by analysis of the published sequences (42Giannini G. Conti A. Mammarella S. Scrobogna M. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 43Ayabe T. Kopf G.S. Schultz R.M. Development. 1995; 121: 2233-2244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of RYR cDNAs using Oligo version 4.0 primer analysis software (National Biosciences Inc., Plymouth, MN). The design of the PCR primers is listed in Table I. PCR reactions were catalyzed using recombinant Taq DNA polymerase, PCR reaction buffer, and dNTPs supplied by TaKaRa Biologicals (Shiga, Japan). The thermal cycling parameters consisted of an initial denaturation step for 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 36 cycles consisting of: 30 s at 95 °C, 60 s at 55 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C. The final extension step was for 5 min at 72 °C. PCR products were resolved by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and DNA was stained with ethidium bromide for fluorescence detection. PCR products corresponding to RYR were extracted from agarose gels by solubilization in NaI and by extraction with silica (GeneClean II; Bio 101 Inc., La Jolla, CA). The purified PCR products were ligated into the pCRII cloning vector by the T/A cloning method (Invitrogen Corp.). Ligation products were used to transform INVαF′ cells (Invitrogen Corp.), and transformants were isolated by antibiotic resistance selection on agar plates containing ampicillin. Individual clones were selected and amplified by inoculation of Luria broth. Cloned plasmid DNAs were extracted from bacterial cultures using the Rapid Pure Miniprep procedure (Bio 101 Inc.). Determination of plasmid DNA sequences containing RYR PCR products was accomplished by the dideoxynucleotide sequencing method of Sanger in combination with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit; U.

The predicted sizes (in base pairs) of the PCR products are listed on the right. The binding of BODIPY FL-X ryanodine (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) to its receptor was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy using primary cultures of dispersed islet cells. An Eclipse E600 upright microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) equipped with 20, 40, and 100× Plan Fluor objectives was interfaced with a digital video imaging system comprising a Photometrics Ltd. Sensys cooled CCD camera (Tucson, AZ) and a MacIntosh G3 computer (Apple Computers, Cupertino, CA) running IP Lab Spectrum software (Scanalytics Inc., Fairfax, VA). A mercury lamp served as the excitation light source, and the emitted light was filtered using standard fluorescein and rhodamine filter sets. Individual islet cells were allowed to adhere to the numbered grid surfaces of CELLocate coverslips (55-μm square size; Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100. The fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated at room temperature in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing the specified concentration of BODIPY FL-X ryanodine. Immunocytochemistry for detection of insulin-like immunoreactivity was performed using 5% normal goat antiserum as a blocking agent. The primary antiserum was guinea pig anti-insulin (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) used at a dilution factor of 1:100. The secondary antiserum was rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Quantitative analyses of islet cell suspensions were performed using a Molecular Dynamics FluorImager running ImageQuant software (Sunnyvale, CA). An argon laser served as the excitation light source, and fluorescence was imaged on 96-well tissue culture plates (Falcon 3072; ∼20,000 islet cells/well) using a fluorescein 530-nm discriminating filter set. Estimates of RYR2 affinity were based on the use of permeabilized cells where access of BODIPY FL-X ryanodine to its binding site was unimpeded. Although the apparent K d for fluorophore binding was ∼4 nm, higher concentrations of ryanodine were required to block CICR in living cells, where access of ryanodine to its binding site was impeded. Cells were maintained on glass coverslips 24–48 h prior to each experiment. The cell culture media was replaced with a standard extracellular salt solution (SES) containing (in mm): 138 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 2.6 CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 7.5 mmd-glucose. The SES was supplemented with 1 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2-AM; Molecular Probes Inc.), 2% fetal bovine serum, and 0.02% Pluronic F-127 (w/v; Molecular Probes Inc.). Cells were exposed to the fura-2 AM-containing solution for 15 min at 22 °C. The loading solution was then removed, and the cells were equilibrated in fresh SES for 10 min at 22 °C. Experiments were performed at 32 °C using a Zeiss IM35 inverted microscope (Thornwood, NJ) outfitted with a temperature-controlled stage, a superfusion system, and a 100× Nikon UVF objective. Dual wavelength excitation microspectrofluorimetry was performed ratiometrically at 1-s intervals using a digital video imaging system (IonOptix Corp., Milton, MA). Calibration of the raw fluorescence values was performed as described previously (22Grapengiesser E. Gylfe E. Hellman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12207-12210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using fura-2 pentapotassium salt dissolved in calibration buffer solutions from Molecular Probes (Calcium Calibration Kit 1 with Magnesium). Insulin-containing β-cells were positively identified at the end of each experiment by fluorescence microscopy in combination with immunocytochemistry. The resting potential and holding current were measured under current clamp or voltage clamp using the tight seal, whole cell, perforated patch configuration (13Holz G.G. Kuhtreiber W.M. Habener J.F. Nature. 1993; 361: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 14Holz G.G. Leech C.A. Habener J.F. J. Biol.

Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Kimax-51; Kimble Glass Inc., Vineland, NJ), fire-polished (final tip resistances of 2–3 megohms), and tip-dipped in a standard patch pipette solution containing (in mm): 95 Cs2SO4, 7 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.4). Pipettes were then back-filled with patch pipette solution supplemented with 240 μg/ml nystatin. The pipette solutions did not contain fura-2 and were considered to be nominally Ca2+-free. Patch pipettes were connected to the head stage of an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (Heka Electroniks, Lambrecht, Germany) interfaced with a personal computer running Pulse version 8.0 acquisition software (Instrutech Corp., Mineola, NY). The series resistance (R s) and cell capacitance (C m) were monitored following seal formation, and experiments were conducted when R s declined to 12–25 megohms and C m increased to 10–40 picofarads. In voltage clamp experiments, R s was compensated for by 60%. Electrical access to the cytosol was confirmed by noting approximately −60-mV resting potential, and by noting an increase of [Ca2+]i in response to a voltage step from −70 to 0 mV. Experiments were rejected if such a rise of [Ca2+]i was not observed. Measurements of membrane potential and current were digitized using an Instrutech VR-10A digital data recorder and stored on magnetic tape for subsequent analysis using pClamp version 6.0 software (Axon Instruments Corp., Foster City, CA). GLP-1-(7–37), exendin-4, and exendin-(9–39) were from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). 8-Br-cAMP, nimodipine, ryanodine, caffeine, and thapsigargin were from Sigma.

The protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) catalytic (C) subunit is reversibly methylated at its carboxyl terminus by specific methyltransferase and methylesterase enzymes which have been purified, but not cloned. Carboxymethylation affects PP2A activity and varies during the cell cycle. Here, we report that substitution of glutamine for either of two putative active site histidines in the PP2A C subunit results in inactivation of PP2A and formation of stable complexes between PP2A and several cellular proteins. One of these cellular proteins, herein named protein phosphatase methylesterase-1 (PME-1), was purified and microsequenced, and its cDNA was cloned. PME-1 is conserved from yeast to human and contains a motif found in lipases having a catalytic triad-activated serine as their active site nucleophile. Bacterially expressed PME-1 demethylated PP2A C subunit in vitro, and okadaic acid, a known inhibitor of the PP2A methylesterase, inhibited this reaction. To our knowledge, PME-1 represents the first mammalian protein methylesterase to be cloned. Several lines of evidence indicate that, although there appears to be a role for C subunit carboxyl-terminal amino acids in PME-1 binding, amino acids other than those at the extreme carboxyl terminus of the C subunit also play an important role in PME-1 binding to a catalytically inactive mutant.

Consonant with its diverse roles, subpopulations of PP2A have been found to localize to the nucleus, cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, and membranes (3Jakes S. Mellgren R.L. Schlender K.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 888: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 4Sim A.T. Ratcliffe E. Mumby M.C. Villa-Moruzzi E. Rostas J.A. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The smallest functional unit of PP2A thought to existin vivo consists of a heterodimer between a catalytic 36-kDa subunit, termed C, and a constant regulatory 63-kDa subunit, termed A (7Usui H. Imazu M. Maeta K. Tsukamoto H. Azuma K. Takeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3752-3761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This A/C heterodimer often further complexes with a member of one of three additional cellular regulatory subunit families termed B (or B55), B′ (or B56), and B“ (or PR72/120) (1Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar). In cells stably transformed by the middle tumor antigen (MT) of polyomavirus, MT substitutes for the B subunit in a small portion (∼10%) (8Ulug E.T. Cartwright A.J. Courtneidge S.A. J.

Brautigan D.L. Roberts T.M. Cell. 1990; 60: 167-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). MT·PP2A complex formation is known to be important for MT-mediated transformation (10Grussenmeyer T. Carbone-Wiley A. Scheidtmann K.H. Walter G. J.

Pallas D.C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3721-3728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the precise functional consequences of MT association with PP2A are still being elucidated. Efforts aimed at understanding PP2A regulation have uncovered a complex set of noncovalent and covalent mechanisms. These include association with different regulatory subunits (1Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar), association with heat stable inhibitors (14Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), action of a phosphotyrosyl activator protein (15Cayla X. Goris J. Hermann J. Hendrix P. Ozon R. Merlevede W.

Chem. 1993; 268: 15523-15530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phosphorylation (17Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Science. 1992; 257: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), and methylation (18Rundell K. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 1240-1243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lee J. Stock J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1981-1984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These mechanisms affect the catalytic activity, substrate specificity, and cellular localization of PP2A. However, little is known about the molecular bases of their effects, and even less about how these effects might be coordinated and integrated to orchestrate PP2A functions throughout the cell. The carboxyl terminus of the PP2A C subunit seems to be a focal point for regulation of PP2A. In addition to containing the amino acids identified as the sites of tyrosine phosphorylation and methylation, this region contains residues essential for stable binding of the B regulatory subunit (23Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It is possible that these three events may influence one another. We have recently shown that substitution of tyrosine 307, the site of tyrosine phosphorylation, with a negatively charged amino acid abolishes both B subunit binding (23Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and methylation of the C subunit. 3X. X. Yu, X. Du, E. Ogris, R. E. Green, Q. Feng, L. Clon, and David Pallas, submitted for publication. In contrast, MT does not require these residues to form PP2A heterotrimers (23Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that different B-type subunits might be differentially affected by, or differentially affect, covalent modification at the carboxyl terminus. The first indication that PP2A C subunit was methylated involved two observations. Rundell (18Rundell K. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 1240-1243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that a 36-kDa SV40 small tumor antigen (ST)-associated cellular protein was a major acceptor of the methyl group from radiolabeled S-adenosylmethionine added to cell extracts. Subsequently, this ST-associated cellular protein was reported to be the PP2A C subunit (9Pallas D.C. Shahrik L.K. Martin B.L. Jaspers S. Miller T.B. Brautigan D.L. Roberts T.M. Cell. 1990; 60: 167-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). More recently, several groups showed that PP2A C subunit is indeed methylated and reported that this methylation is reversible and occurs on the carboxyl-terminal amino acid leucine 309, forming a methyl ester (19Lee J. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19192-19195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Li M. Damuni Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Favre B. Zolnierowicz S. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16311-16317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Xie H. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1981-1984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the PP2A methyltransferase and methylesterase enzymes have been purified and an initial characterization performed (19Lee J. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19192-19195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lee J. Chen Y. Tolstykh T. Stock J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6043-6047Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, cloning of cDNAs for these enzymes has not been reported and their primary sequences are unknown. Although methyltransferase and methylesterase enzymes specific for PP2A have been purified, the regulation and role(s) of PP2A methylation have only begun to be elucidated. Based on differential antibody recognition of methylated and non-methylated C subunits, PP2A has been reported to undergo cell cycle dependent changes in methylation (6Turowski P. Fernandez A. Favre B. Lamb N.J. Hemmings B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This suggests that PP2A methylation may participate in the regulation of, or be regulated by, cell cycle progression. cAMP was found to stimulate PP2A methylation in Xenopus egg lysates (25Floer M. Stock J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), suggesting that this second messenger may be involved in the regulation of PP2A methylation. The activity of PP2A toward phosphorylase a and a phosphopeptide substrate was reported to increase approximately 2-fold upon methylation (21Favre B. Zolnierowicz S. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16311-16317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Greater effects might be observed with other substrates, given that the effects of some other mechanisms of PP2A regulation, such as B-type subunit association and heat-stable inhibitor proteins, have been shown to be highly substrate dependent. Another possibility is that PP2A methylation might affect B-type subunit association, or vice versa. The exact determinants on PP2A essential for functional recognition by the PP2A methyltransferase and methylesterase enzymes are unknown, although they must include more than just the highly conserved carboxyl terminus itself. Xie and Clarke (22Xie H. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1981-1984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that a synthetic carboxyl-terminal PP2A C subunit octapeptide functions neither as a PP2A methyltransferase substrate nor as an inhibitor, and Lee and co-workers (24Lee J. Chen Y. Tolstykh T. Stock J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6043-6047Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a methylated synthetic carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide also functions neither as a PP2A methylesterase substrate nor as an inhibitor. In the latter study, a 600-fold excess of unmethylated PP2A C subunit was found to inhibit the PP2A methylesterase by 50%, while a 106-fold excess of a carboxyl-terminal C subunit decapeptide did not inhibit the methylesterase at all. Collectively, these results suggest that both enzymes make essential contacts with C subunit residues that are not in the carboxyl terminus. One hint as to where such contacts might be located comes from the observation that the potent PP2A inhibitors okadaic acid and microcystin-LR also inhibit the PP2A methyltransferase and/or methylesterase enzymes (19Lee J. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19192-19195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Li M. Damuni Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24Lee J. Chen Y. Tolstykh T. Stock J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6043-6047Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this inhibition may be due to these inhibitors binding in part to the carboxyl-terminal region of the C subunit, interfering with the binding of the methyltransferase and methylesterase. However, an equally attractive possibility is that these two enzymes interact with residues in or around the active site of PP2A. In this study, we report that an individual substitution of either of two PP2A C subunit active site histidines with glutamine results in a catalytically inactive PP2A mutant that forms a stable complex with several cellular proteins not bound stably by wt C subunit. The formation of this stable complex enabled us to purify, microsequence, and clone the first of these cellular proteins, which we have designated PME-1. PME-1 was identified as a PP2A methylesterase by the ability of the bacterially expressed and purified enzyme to demethylate PP2A C subunit. To our knowledge, this is the first mammalian methylesterase for which protein or cDNA sequences have been reported. Data base searches reveal a single homolog inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as complete or partial sequences, respectively, for homologs in Caenorhabditis elegans and zebrafish, indicating that this enzyme is conserved across eukaryotes. PME-1 contains a motif found in lipases that utilize a catalytic triad-activated serine as their active site nucleophile, and has other scattered homology with other lipases in which this motif is conserved. Based on a number of results, we propose that the specificity of PME-1 for PP2A may in part be determined by interaction with residues or metals in or near the PP2A active site. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on a HA-tagged wt C subunit cDNA cloned in the pcDNA I Amp vector (23Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) using the Muta-Gene Phagemid In VitroMutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). The entire cDNA of both H59Q and H118Q was sequenced to confirm successful mutagenesis and to ensure that no additional mutation occurred. Mutant C subunit cDNAs including the HA tag coding sequence were cloned into the dexamethasone-inducible vector, pGRE5-2 (26Mader S. White J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5603-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The construction of a pGRE5-2 vector expressing HA-tagged wt PP2A C subunit has been previously described (23Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To make a PME-1 construct (pPS.PME-1) to be used for sequencing andin vitro transcription/translation, the PME-1 cDNA product generated by RT-PCR (see below) was inserted via blunt end ligation into an SrfI site in the PCR-ScriptTMSK(+) vector using the PCR-ScriptTM SK(+) kit (Stratagene). NIH3T3 lines expressing wt polyomavirus MT and a geneticin resistance gene (27Cherington V. Morgan B. Spiegelman B.M. Roberts T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4307-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and individual clones and mixtures of clones expressing wt C subunit (wt C sub), H59Q, H118Q, or empty vector (GREonly) were selected and maintained as described previously (23Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). H118Q expressed at a level well below that of endogenous wt C subunit, while H59Q expressed at a level equal to or greater than the wt level. Although the inducible vector, pGRE5-2, was used to express these proteins, their levels were substantial in the absence of dexamethasone; for this reason, GREonly cells were used as a negative control in this study rather than uninduced wt or mutant C subunit expressing cells. However, dexamethasone treatment was used throughout to obtain maximal expression of the C subunits. For metabolic labeling of cells with methionine, subconfluent dishes of cells were labeled for 5 h with [35S]methionine (300 μCi/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium minus methionine supplemented with 0.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. The details of treating the cells with dexamethasone, preparation of cell lysates, and immunoprecipitation of C subunits have been described previously (23Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For experiments quantitating PME-1 binding to different mutants (Fig. 6 B), immunoprecipitates were washed twice with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and once with ddH20. Washed immune complexes were used for phosphatase assays or analyzed by one or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% acrylamide) was performed according to Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional gel analysis was performed as described previously (30Pallas D. Solomon F. Cell. 1982; 30: 407-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Gels were silver stained by the procedure of Wray et al. (31Wray W. Bolikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Biochemistry. 1981; 118: 197-203Google Scholar) except that after electrophoresis the gels were sequentially incubated 10 min in distilled water (200 ml), 10 min in 95% ethanol (200 ml), 1 h in 50% methanol (100 ml), and 30 min in distilled water (100 ml) prior to staining. Immunoblotting (32Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar) was performed with mouse monoclonal anti-tag antibody (16B12; 1:5000 dilution of ascites; BAbCO), rabbit anti-B subunit antibody (P16; 1:5000), affinity-purified rabbit (R39; 1:5000) or mouse monoclonal (4G7; 1 μg/ml) anti-A subunit antibodies, mouse monoclonal anti-MT antibody (F4; 0.25 μg/ml) (33Pallas D.C. Schley C. Mahoney M. Harlow E. Schaffhausen B.S. Roberts T.M. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 1075-1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mouse monoclonal anti-C subunit antibody (1D6; 0.25 μg/ml), or rabbit anti-PME-1 antibodies (AR2 or E37; see below). Immunoblots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham or NEN Life Science Products Inc.). Phosphatase activity present in anti-HA tag immunoprecipitates from the different cell lines was assayed using phosphorylase a and histone H1. γ-32P-Labeled phosphorylase a substrate was prepared from phosphorylaseb according to the manufacturer's (Life Technologies, Inc.) instructions. Histone H1 was phosphorylated by mitotic p34 cdc2purified from Nocodazole arrested HeLa cells as described previously (34Mayer-Jaekel R.E. Ohkura H. Ferrigno P. Andjelkovic N. Shiomi K. Uemura T. Glover D.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2609-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates used for immunoprecipitation were equilibrated according to HA-tagged C subunit expression levels. Assays were performed at a linear range and with subsaturating amounts of each substrate. To obtain p44A(PME-1) protein for microsequencing, H59Q C subunit complexes containing p44A(PME-1) were immunoaffinity purified. In total, 135 confluent 15-cm dishes of MT-transformed NIH3T3 cells expressing HA-tagged H59Q were used. Forty-five separate immunoaffinity purifications were performed on 3 dishes of lysate at a time, reusing the same immunoaffinity matrix at least 15 times. To prepare the immunoaffinity matrix, anti-HA tag antibody (12CA5; obtained from BAbCO) was chemically cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) by published methods (35Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Cell lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C while rocking with 500 μl of the cross-linked antibody-bead complexes. Complexes were washed once with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, three times with Tris-buffered saline, and then twice with distilled deionized H2O. Bound H59Q complexes containing p44A(PME-1) were eluted by three sequential incubations with 300 μl of 20 mm triethylamine. Eluates were quickly frozen on dry ice and stored frozen until all batches of affinity purification had been completed. The antibody-bead complexes were then washed twice with 20 mm triethylamine and twice with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer prior to reuse. After H59Q complexes had been purified from all 135 dishes of cells, eluates containing p44A(PME-1) were concentrated to dryness by vacuum centrifugation, and the residues were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline and gel buffer and analyzed on three separate SDS-polyacrylamide gels. One-dimensional gels were chosen to avoid losses associated with two-dimensional gel analysis. Because p44A(PME-1) migrates closely to actin, the separation of these two proteins was maximized by the use of an 8% gel run for an extended period of time. After separation of p44A(PME-1) complexes by SDS-PAGE, the proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidiene difluoride membrane and stained with Ponceau S. Individual protein bands were excised and subjected to in situ digestion with trypsin (36Fernandez J. Andrews L. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 37Lane W.S. Galat A. Harding M.W. Schreiber S.L. J. Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The resulting peptide mixture was separated by microbore high performance liquid chromatography using a Zorbax C18 2.1 × 150-mm reverse phase column on a Hewlett-Packard 1090 HPLC/1040 diode array detector. Optimum fractions from the chromatogram were chosen based on differential UV absorbance at 205, 277, and 292 nm, peak symmetry and resolution. Peaks were further screened for length and homogeneity by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry on a Finnigan Lasermat 2000 (Hemel United Kingdom), and selected fractions were submitted to automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 494A, 477A (Foster City, CA) or Hewlett-Packard G1005A (Palo Alto, CA). Details of strategies for the selection of peptide fractions and their microsequencing have been previously described (37Lane W.S. Galat A. Harding M.W. Schreiber S.L. J. Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To obtain the missing 5′ portion of the PME-1 coding region, nested and semi-nested PCR were performed using human B cell, human hippocampus, and human kidney plasmid libraries. 5′ primers corresponded to vector sequence that flanked cDNA inserts in the library being used as template, while 3′ primers corresponded to known sequence (EST or newly derived 5′ PME-1 sequence). Southern blotting using an end-labeled 20-base pair oligonucleotide corresponding to known PME-1 sequence upstream of the 3′ PCR primer was employed to identify authentic PME-1 products after each reaction. PCR products containing 5′ extensions of the PME-1 sequence were purified using a PCR product purification kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), cloned, and sequenced. New primers were designed for PCR and Southern blotting and then the above steps were repeated until the sequence of the remainder of the PME-1 coding region and a portion of the 5′ UTR were obtained. Total mRNA was purified from HeLa cells using Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand synthesis was performed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by the manufacturer's protocol using a primer from the PME-1 3′ UTR (TGTTGAGGAGGGGTGGACAG). Using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), the product was used for PCR with the same 3′ primer and a primer from the PME-1 5′ UTR (TGTATGGGGACCTTCCTCCT) to generate a cDNA containing the entire PME-1 coding region and much of the 5′ UTR. The NCBI BLAST program (38Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar) was used to probe various data bases for p44A(PME-1) ESTs and related proteins. The DNASTAR Lasergene software package was utilized for alignments and identification of the PROSITE data base lipase motif found in p44A(PME-1). Adult Balb/c mice were sacrificed and organs removed and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA from the organs was isolated using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN), and analyzed on formaldehyde, 1% agarose gels to check for RNA integrity and to estimate the amount of the 18 S and 28 S RNAs. Based on these estimates, similar amounts of RNA were separated on formaldehyde, 1% agarose gels and transferred to GeneScreen nylon membranes. After UV cross-linking, the membranes were stained with a 0.04% methylene blue solution to visualize the RNA. Filters were then hybridized with a32P-radiolabeled probe generated by random primer labeling of a DNA fragment from the 3′-untranslated region of the mouse PME-1 cDNA. The probe, 395 base pairs in length, is anEcoRI-NotI fragment of a PME-1 EST clone (accession number W34856). The blots were used for autoradiography with x-ray film and/or analyzed on a STORM PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Two different antisera recognizing PME-1 were raised in rabbits. The first, AR2, was raised against a 16-residue PME-1 peptide sequence (RIELAKTEKYWDGWFR) found encoded in the PME-1 cDNA. The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via an added carboxyl-terminal cysteine residue using a Pierce Imject conjugation kit, and the conjugate was used as immunogen. The second antiserum, E37, was raised against a mixture of two nickel agarose-purified, 6xHis-tagged, bacterially expressed human PME-1 fragments that together represent the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein. For each immunogen, a single female New Zealand White rabbit was immunized and boosted multiple times using Freund's adjuvant. Assays utilizing methylation-sensitive antibodies (6Turowski P. Fernandez A. Favre B. Lamb N.J. Hemmings B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) were performed to evaluate PP2A demethylation. Logarithmically growing wt C subunit-expressing MT-transformed NIH3T3 cells were lysed and C subunit immunoprecipitated as described previously (23Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The C subunit immunoprecipitate was divided into equal aliquots for use as substrate in demethylation reactions. C subunit immune complexes from one 10-cm dish of cells could support 8 demethylation reactions. To each aliquot of substrate, 38.75 μl of reaction buffer containing 55 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 55 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.55% Nonidet P-40, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was added. Then, 0.5 μl of inhibitor (okadaic acid or PMSF) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide or dimethyl sulfoxide without inhibitor was added to the appropriate tubes. After 3 min, 0.75 μl of lysate from bacteria expressing or not expressing PME-1 was added to the appropriate tubes (to obtain bacterial lysate, bacteria were lysed by sonication in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 140 mm NaCl, and lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × gfor 5 min). Demethylation reactions were carried out at 32 °C with shaking for 60 min. Then the reactions were combined with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled. Following SDS-PAGE and electrophoretic transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose, the membrane was immunoblotted as described in the legend to Fig. 5. In order to create catalytically inactive PP2A C subunit mutants that retained the maximum amount of structural integrity, single residues likely to be important for catalysis were mutated. To identify such residues, an alig"

We used saturating peptide-based mutational analyses of the TRAF1/TRAF2/TRAF3 and TRAF6 binding sequences in CD40 to finely map residues involved in CD40-TRAF interactions. The core binding site for TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF3 in CD40 could be minimally substituted. The TRAF6 binding site demonstrated more amino acid sequence flexibility and could be optimized. Point mutations that eliminated or enhanced binding of TRAFs to one or both sites were made in CD40 and tested in quantitative CD40-TRAF binding assays. Sequences flanking the core TRAF binding sites were found to modulate TRAF binding, and the two TRAF binding sites were not independent. Cloned stable transfectants of human embryonic kidney 293 cells that expressed wild type CD40 or individual CD40 mutations were used to demonstrate that both TRAF binding sites were required for optimal NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation. In contrast, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was primarily dependent upon TRAF6 binding. These studies suggest a role in CD40 signaling for competitive TRAF binding and imply that CD40 responses reflect an integration of signals from individual TRAFs.

CD40 signaling is initiated by receptor oligomerization upon binding the trimeric ligand CD154 (CD40 ligand/gp39). Numerous and different outcomes of CD40 signaling occur in distinct cell types and imply a complex regulation of CD40 signal transduction. Several different signal transduction pathways have been demonstrated to be activated following CD40 oligomerization. CD40-mediated signaling results in NF-κB activation (2Berberich I. Shu G.L.

TRAF interactions with CD40 appear to require an oligomerized receptor cytoplasmic domain and are thought to be responsible for initiating activation of most of the CD40-mediated signaling pathways. The signaling functions of most of the six TRAF family members have been characterized genetically and biochemically. A function for TRAF1 in regulating apoptosis has been suggested from transgenic mice expressing a dominant negative TRAF1 transgene (16Speiser D.E. Lee S.Y. Wong B. Arron J. Santana A. Kong Y.Y.

Studies using TRAF2 knockout mice and transgenic mice expressing a dominant negative form of TRAF2 showed that TRAF2 is required for JNK activation but has limited involvement in NF-κB activation (17Yeh W.C.

However, specific mutations in the CD40 cytoplasmic domain that individually affect TRAF1, TRAF2, or TRAF3 binding have not been identified. Although human TRAF5 does not interact directly with the CD40 cytoplasmic domain, it can be recruited indirectly as a hetero-oligomer with TRAF3 (11Pullen S.S. Miller H.G. Everdeen D.S. Dang T.T.A. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11836-11845Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The TRAF6 binding site has been mapped to a membrane-proximal region (231QEPQEINF) (11Pullen S.S. Miller H.G. Everdeen D.S. Dang T.T.A. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R.

However, it is not known which of these amino acid residues in CD40 are critical for TRAF6 interaction. Whether the two TRAF binding regions in the CD40 cytoplasmic domain are independent and can simultaneously mediate binding of different TRAFs or whether binding of a TRAF to one binding region would block binding of a second TRAF has not been determined. Additionally, the role of individual TRAFs in activating different CD40-dependent signaling pathways has not been defined. To gain a better understanding of the interactions between TRAFs and their cognate binding sites on the CD40 cytoplasmic domain and define the role of individual TRAFs in CD40 signaling, saturating peptide-based mutational analyses of the TRAF binding sites in the CD40 cytoplasmic domain were performed. TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF3 had similar binding specificities for the core 250PVQET sequence with few amino acid substitutions tolerated. The TRAF6 binding sequence could be more freely substituted, and a TRAF6 consensus sequence is proposed. Stable transfectants expressing selected CD40 mutations were used to define the roles of individual TRAFs in CD40 signaling. Maximal NF-κB and JNK activation through CD40 required both TRAF6 and TRAF1/TRAF2/TRAF3 binding sites. In contrast, p38 MAPK activation resulted primarily from TRAF6 binding to CD40. Competitive TRAF binding and integration of signals from different TRAFs may contribute to a diversity and complexity of CD40 signaling outcomes in different cell types. The plasmid pGST-CD40c has been described previously (11Pullen S.S. Miller H.G. Everdeen D.S. Dang T.T.A. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11836-11845Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Using oligonucleotides 5′-TCATCACTGTCTCTCCTGCACTGAGA-3′and 5′-TTTGGATCCATGGTTCGTCTGCCTCTGCAGT-3′, the human CD40 gene was amplified by RT-PCR from JY cells and ligated into pGem-T (Promega) to create phCD40/GemT. The BstZI-SpeI fragment from phCD40/GemT was ligated into pcDNA3.1+ digested withNheI and NotI to make phCD40/cDNA. Amino acid substitutions in CD40 were generated using complementary primers with the desired base changes and pGST-CD40c or phCD40/cDNA as templates using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All mutated genes were verified by automated DNA sequencing. The NF-κB reporter plasmid pNF-κB-Luc was purchased from Stratagene. Recombinant baculoviruses that express TRAF1-CA21, TRAF2-CA21, TRAF3-CA21, and TRAF6-CA21 have been described previously (11Pullen S.S. Miller H.G. Everdeen D.S. Dang T.T.A. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R.

Expression of GST-CD40c fusion proteins in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) was by induction with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose and gel filtration as described previously (11Pullen S.S. Miller H.G. Everdeen D.S. Dang T.T.A. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11836-11845Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were quantitated as described (29Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar), frozen in aliquots under liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Mouse CD8α-human CD40L fusion protein was expressed in Sf21 insect cells 2S. S. Pullen, D. S. Everdeen, and M. R. Kehry, unpublished results. (30Lane P. Brocker T. Hubele S. Padovan E.

Fusion protein was eluted from the affinity column with ImmunoPure Gentle Ag/Ab elution buffer (Pierce), dialyzed against 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and frozen in aliquots at −80 °C. The CA21 hybridoma producing a mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody against a peptide epitope derived from the cytoplasmic domain of humanl-selectin (31Kahn J. Ingraham R.H. Shirley F. Migaki G.I. Kishimoto T.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) was purified as described (32Hardy R.R. Weir E.M. Handbook of Experimental Immunology.

Herzenberg L.A. Immunol. Rev. 1979; 47: 63-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in serum-free medium (Nutridoma-SP, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the antibody was purified as described (32Hardy R.R. Weir E.M. Handbook of Experimental Immunology. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Cambridge, MA1986: 13.1-13.13Google Scholar). Peptides C-terminally attached to cellulose membranes were synthesized by Jerini BioTools, GmbH (Berlin, Germany). Each peptide spot contained ∼10 nmol of peptide/3-mm2 circle (35Kramer A. Schuster A. Reineke U. Malin R. Volkmer-Engert R. Landgraf C. Schneider-Mergener J.

Blocking and binding were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Membranes were probed with Sf21 cytosolic extracts diluted to contain approximately 1 μg/ml CA21 epitope-tagged TRAF in binding buffer. After electroblotting to PVDF membranes, TRAF proteins were detected with biotin-CA21-epitope specific monoclonal antibody (31Kahn J. Ingraham R.H. Shirley F. Migaki G.I. Kishimoto T.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (0.5 μg/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch), and horseradish peroxidase chemiluminescence blotting substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The original membrane containing the peptides was stripped sequentially according to the manufacturer's protocol with four buffers: 500 mm lithium perchlorate; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-ME; 50 mm glycine, pH 2.8; and 50 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 1 m NaCl, 100 mm 2-ME. Serial dilutions of purified GST-CD40c fusion protein were incubated in 96-well plates (Reacti-Bind, glutathione-coated; Pierce) in 100 μl of 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (binding buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed in binding buffer and blocked in binding buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed in binding buffer and probed with TRAF-CA21 containing cytosolic extracts from infected Sf21 insect cells diluted in binding buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. TRAF binding was detected with 1.0 μg/ml biotin-conjugated CA21 antibody and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (0.5 μg/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Color development (37Hodgkin P.D. Yamashita L.C.

Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3507) Google Scholar) was stopped after 1–2 min by the addition of 100 μl of 0.2 mcitric acid/well. OD405–490 was quantitated on a 96-well plate reader (Vmax; Molecular Devices). Ten micrograms of phCD40/cDNA or plasmids expressing the indicated mutations of CD40 were transfected into 2 × 106 human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells ((38), ATCC) using Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Forty-eight h after transfection medium was removed and replaced with medium containing 0.4 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Geneticin-resistant cells were expanded and stained with FITC mouse anti-human CD40 monoclonal antibody (PharMingen). Narrowly gated CD40-expressing cells were sorted into 96-well plates at 1 cell/well with a FACS Vantage (Becton Dickinson). Clones were expanded, and surface CD40 levels were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) as described above. Two independent clonal isolates expressing similar levels of CD40 were chosen from each transfected cell line for subsequent analysis. In all cases, the two independent clones of each cell line responded similarly to CD40 stimulation. Representative results from one isolate are shown for all experiments. Three micrograms of the reporter plasmid pNF-κB-Luc (Stratagene) were transfected into 1 × 106 HEK 293 cells or stable CD40 transfectants of HEK 293 cells in 60-mm dishes using Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four h after transfection, medium was removed and replaced with medium alone or with 10 μg/ml purified mouse CD8α-human CD40L fusion protein and 15 μg/ml rat anti-mouse CD8α monoclonal antibody (53-6). After 6 h, cell extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity using the Luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. One million HEK 293 cells or stable transfectants were plated in 60-mm dishes and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cells were stimulated for 15 min with medium alone or medium containing 10 μg/ml mouse CD8α-human CD40L and 15 μg/ml rat anti-mouse CD8α. Cells were harvested and lysed in 2% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% 2-ME. After heating at 95 °C for 5 min, portions of the supernatant were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide Tris-glycine; Novex) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) by electroblotting. Immunoblot analysis of transferred proteins was performed by incubating membranes with 1 μg/ml anti-p38 (N-20, Santa Cruz), 1 μg/ml anti-JNK (JNK1-FL, Santa Cruz), 1:2000 dilution of anti-Active p38 (Promega), or 1:5000 dilution of anti-Active JNK (Promega), followed by a 1:2000 dilution of Protein A-HRP (Bio-Rad). Visualization of total and activated kinases was performed by chemiluminescence using Pierce SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate. Minimal binding sites for TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF6 in the human CD40 cytoplasmic domain were previously mapped using peptides from CD40 synthesized on cellulose membranes. Using overlapping peptides and peptides with progressive deletions from the N terminus, C terminus, or both termini, TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF3 bound optimally to the sequence250PVQET, whereas TRAF6 bound to a more membrane-proximal sequence: 231QEPQEINF (11Pullen S.S. Miller H.G. Everdeen D.S. Dang T.T.A. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11836-11845Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To more precisely define residues critical for CD40-TRAF interactions within each binding site, peptides singly substituted at each position by each of the 20 amino acids were synthesized on cellulose membranes. Peptides were synthesized with either single l-amino acid substitutions or with single d-amino acid substitutions to test requirements for amino acid side chain orientation. Insect cell extracts containing recombinant TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, or TRAF6 proteins were individually tested for binding to the substituted immobilized peptides. l-Amino acid or d-amino acid substitutions for residues N-terminal to the 250PVQET sequence minimally affected TRAF1, TRAF2, or TRAF3 binding (Fig.1, A–C). This indicates these residues were not involved in TRAF1, TRAF2, or TRAF3 interactions with the peptides. Peptides with l-His substituted for Pro250 supported TRAF1 and TRAF2 binding and appeared to have enhanced TRAF3 binding (Fig. 1, A–C). All otherl-amino acid replacements for Pro250 eliminated binding of TRAF1 and TRAF2. TRAF3 binding, but not TRAF1 or TRAF2 binding, was retained when Pro250 was replaced withl-Gly. Peptides with Val251 replaced byl-Ile still efficiently bound TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF3 (Fig.1, A–C). Gln252 and Glu253 could not be replaced by any other l-amino acids, indicating that these residues were critical for TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF3 binding to the peptides. Peptides with Thr254 replaced byl-Ser still maintained TRAF1, TRAF2, or TRAF3 binding, but all other substitutions for Thr254 eliminated binding (Fig.1, A–C). Most l-amino acid ord-amino acid substitutions of Leu255 had little effect on TRAF1, TRAF2, or TRAF3 binding, indicating that this residue was not required for TRAF interactions with peptides from the CD40 cytoplasmic domain. A summary of amino acids allowed at each position and some amino acid replacements that resulted in reduced binding are shown in Table I.Table ISummary of TRAF binding site mutationsConsensus binding siteaBoldface font indicates a stronger interaction.

Open table in a new tab d-Amino acid replacements of most residues in the250PVQET sequence eliminated TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF3 binding (Fig. 1, A–C). Peptides with d-Tyr substituted for Pro250 could efficiently bind TRAF1. Peptides with Pro250 replaced by severald-amino acids still maintained TRAF2 binding. TRAF3, but not TRAF1 or TRAF2, bound to peptides with Pro250 replaced by numerous d-amino acids. The 251VQE sequence could not be substituted with d-amino acids (Fig. 1,A–C), indicating contributions of these side chains to TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF3 interactions. Peptides with Thr254replaced by d-Ser or d-Thr residues maintained TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF3 interactions. l-Amino acid substitutions in the TRAF6 binding peptide indicated there were three amino acid residues critical for TRAF6 binding to the 14-amino acid peptide: Pro233, Glu235, and Phe238 (Fig. 1 D and Table I). Pro233 could only be replaced byl-Ala, and Phe238 could be replaced byl-Trp or l-Tyr. Numerous l-amino acid substitutions of the remaining residues of CD40 from positions 230 to 237 could be made without eliminating TRAF6 binding. This suggested that those residues were not making essential contributions to TRAF6 binding to the peptides. Substitution of most residues C-terminal to Phe238 with either l-amino acids ord-amino acids minimally affected TRAF6 binding (Fig.1 D), indicating these residues were not required. Mostd-amino acid substitutions of the sequence232EPQEINF eliminated TRAF6 binding to the peptides. These results indicate that the core TRAF6 binding site may actually be232EPQEINF. This is consistent with previous mapping studies delineating Phe238 as the C-terminal end of the TRAF6 binding site (11Pullen S.S. Miller H.G. Everdeen D.S. Dang T.T.A. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11836-11845Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In our previous analyses of TRAF2 and TRAF3 binding sites in the CD40 cytoplasmic domain, sequences C-terminal to the 250PVQET motif appeared to contribute to binding (11Pullen S.S. Miller H.G. Everdeen D.S. Dang T.T.A. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11836-11845Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of this region in TRAF2 and TRAF3 binding, a mutational analysis on peptides containing the 250PVQET sequence with 11 additional C-terminal amino acids was performed. TRAF2 binding to the longer peptide with single l-amino acid substitutions or d-amino acid substitutions was identical to that observed for the mutational analysis in Fig. 1 B (compare Figs. 1 B and 2 A; data not shown for d-amino acid substitutions). Similarly, TRAF1 binding specificity for longer peptides in the mutational analysis was not significantly different from the mutational analysis on the shorter peptide (Fig. 1 A; data not shown). In contrast, numerous l-amino acid substitutions could be made in the 250PVQET sequence without substantially affecting TRAF3 binding when 11 amino acid residues C-terminal to250PVQET were included in the peptide. Notably, mostl-amino acid substitutions for Glu253 had no effect on TRAF3 binding, whereas no l-amino acids could be substituted for Glu253 in the mutational analysis on the shorter peptide in Fig. 1 C (compare Figs. 1 C and2 B). Peptides with several different l-amino acid substitutions for Pro250, Val251, or Gln252 were also able to bind TRAF3 when 11 additional amino acids C-terminal"

One essential function of Lck in this process is to phosphorylate ZAP-70 and up-regulate its catalytic activity. We have previously shown that after T-cell antigen receptor stimulation, Lck binds to ZAP-70 via its Src homology 2 (SH2) domain (LckSH2) and, more recently, that Tyr319 of ZAP-70 is phosphorylated in vivo and plays a positive regulatory role. Here, we investigated the possibility that Tyr319 mediates the SH2-dependent interaction between Lck and ZAP-70. We show that a phosphopeptide encompassing the motif harboring Tyr319, YSDP, interacted with LckSH2, although with a lower affinity compared with a phosphopeptide containing the optimal binding motif, YEEI. Moreover, mutation of Tyr319 to phenylalanine prevented the interaction of ZAP-70 with LckSH2. Based on these results, a gain-of-function mutant of ZAP-70 was generated by changing the sequence Y319SDP into Y319EEI. As a result of its increased ability to bind LckSH2, this mutant induced a dramatic increase in NFAT activity in Jurkat T-cells, was hyperphosphorylated, and displayed a higher catalytic activity compared with wild-type ZAP-70. Collectively, our findings indicate that Tyr319-mediated binding of the SH2 domain of Lck is crucial for ZAP-70 activation and consequently for the propagation of the signaling cascade leading to T-cell activation.

Recent studies in our laboratory have shown that Tyr319, in the linker region between the two tandem SH2 domains and the kinase domain (interdomain B; see Fig. 1) of ZAP-70, is a TCR-induced phosphorylation site and has an essential positive role in the regulation of the kinase (16Di Bartolo V.

Indeed, mutation of Tyr319to phenylalanine, although not affecting the basal kinase activity, strongly reduced the activation-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 and the up-regulation of its catalytic activity following TCR stimulation. Consistently, overexpression of the mutant Y319F in T-cells severely reduced the phosphorylation of ZAP-70 substrates (SLP-76 and LAT) and the TCR-dependent activation of NFAT and interleukin-2 production (16Di Bartolo V.

We and others have previously demonstrated that after TCR stimulation, Lck binds to ZAP-70 via its SH2 domain (LckSH2), raising the possibility that this association is required for ZAP-70 activation by Lck (11Duplay P.

Consistently, expression in an Lck-deficient cell line of an SH2 point mutant of Lck was unable to restore the TCR-mediated activation, a defect that correlated with the lack of Lck-ZAP-70 interaction and the dramatic reduction of ZAP-70 tyrosine phosphorylation (18Straus D.B. Chan A.C. Patai B. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9976-9981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The facts that mutation of either Tyr319 or Tyr493 leads to a dramatic decrease in ZAP-70 function (7Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.-H. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T.

In this work we provide evidence supporting this notion. The minimal sequence critical for interaction with the SH2 domains of Src PTKs comprises the three amino acids immediately C-terminal to a phosphorylatable tyrosine residue (19Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.J. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar). By using a degenerated phosphopeptide library, it has been shown that the motif pYEEI is preferentially selected by the SH2 domain of members of the Src family of PTKs (19Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.J. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar). We built a molecular model of the motif encompassing Tyr319 of ZAP-70 (YSDP) complexed to LckSH2 and found that despite the divergence between the Y319SDP and the optimal motif YEEI, the former possesses structural features compatible with its binding to LckSH2. Competition experiments of the binding betweenin vivo phosphorylated ZAP-70 and LckSH2 using a synthetic peptide comprising Y319SDP confirmed that this motif efficiently interacts with LckSH2, although less well than a YEEI-containing peptide. Moreover, we demonstrate that mutation of Tyr319 to phenylalanine abolishes the interaction of ZAP-70 with the LckSH2, whereas mutation of the neighbor Tyr315, another residue phosphorylated in vivo following TCR triggering (16Di Bartolo V.

Based on these data, we generated a mutant of ZAP-70 in which the natural sequence encompassing Tyr319 was changed to Y319EEI (ZAP-YEEI). This mutant showed a strong gain-of-function phenotype. Indeed, although its basal kinase activity and its capacity to bind to phosphorylated ITAMs were unaffected, ZAP-YEEI, expressed in Jurkat cells: (i) was hyperphosphorylated, an event that correlated with an augmented catalytic activity, and ii) induced a strong increase in NFAT activity. The gain-of-function phenotype of ZAP-YEEI was dependent on the cell surface expression of the TCR. These data are discussed in the context of a model in which the SH2-mediated binding of Lck to Tyr319 provides an essential step in the activation of ZAP-70. Polyclonal anti VSV-G rabbit antiserum (anti-tag) directed against an 11-amino acid synthetic peptide determinant (an additional cysteine was added to the C terminus for coupling to the carrier) derived from vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) was generated in our laboratory using keyhole limpet hemocyanin as a carrier; anti ZAP-70 antiserum (4.06) was produced in our laboratory as already described (20Grazioli L.

A peptide (phospho-ITAM) corresponding to the first ITAM motif of the human TCR-ζ chain (residues 48–66) plus a 4-amino acid linker at the N terminus (sequence: SGSGNQLYNELNLGRREEYDVLD) was synthesized as diphosphorylated on Tyr51 and Tyr62 form (by F. Baleux, Department of Organic Chemistry, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Phospho-ITAM was purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and biotinylated at the N terminus by Biotin sulfo-NHS (Pierce). The purity and the molecular mass of the peptides were confirmed by ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The human leukemia Jurkat T-cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.)

The ZAP-Y319EEI mutant was derived from this construct by polymerase chain reaction: the 5′ primer (nucleotides 713–734 of ZAP-70 sequence) encompassed a MluI unique site; the 3′ primer encoded for the Y319EEI mutation (CCC GAG CTC CTC TAT CTC TTC GTA GGG GCT C) and contained aSacI site. The MluI-SacI-digested (nucleotides 713–1179) polymerase chain reaction product was ligated with both a SacI-NsiI fragment (nucleotides 1179–1736) and a 3.8-kilobase ZAP-70WT-VSV-G pBs fragment restricted with MluI and NsiI (10Mège D.

The structure of the SH2 domain of Lck with the phosphotyrosine in its binding pocket was derived from the crystallographic atomic coordinates of the LckSH2-pYEEI peptide complex (25Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1LCJ). The CHARMM academic program was used to built sequentially the amino acids (SDP) ab initio. For each structure of the previous step (the crystallographic one for the first step, i.e. the pY residue) the next amino acid was appended either in its standard β-sheet conformation or rotated every 30 degrees along its phi angle. Then the system was subjected to 10 ps of molecular dynamics at 3000 K for each rotamer. The conformations were saved every 0.1 ps, minimized, and grouped into clusters. The lowest energy structure of each cluster (about a dozen) was kept to initiate the next step of the building. The resulting structure was both the one with the lowest energy and the one belonging to the largest cluster. We used a sigmoidal dielectric constant to mimic the effect of the solvent while enabling fast evaluations of the energy minimizations or molecular dynamics and therefore a wide sampling. Transient transfections of Jurkat cells were performed by electroporation (260 V, 960 microfarads) as already described (10Mège D. Di Bartolo V. Germain V. Tuosto L. Michel F. Acuto O. J. Biol.

The total amount of plasmidic DNA was equalized with the empty pSRα-puro vector. Transfected cells were cultured for 24 h, and then 105 cells were seeded in 100 ml of growth medium into U-bottomed 96-well plates. Cells were left unstimulated or stimulated at 37 °C for 8 h with 101.5.2 anti-TCR mAb (precoated to wells at 1:1000 dilution of ascites) or with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (50 ng/ml) (Sigma) and calcium ionophore A23187 (2 μg/ml) (Sigma). β-Galactosidase and luciferase assays were performed by using the specific assay systems (Promega). Luciferase activity was determined in triplicate samples using an automated luminometer (Lumat LB 9501, Berthold, Wildbad, Germany) and expressed as a percentage of maximal response (percentage of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionophore). The GST-(ΔSH2)ZAP-70 fusion proteins (WT and mutant) were autophosphorylated for 30 min at room temperature in 1 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 7.5 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP.

Transfected cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40-containing buffer and expressed ZAP-70-WT or mutant was immunoprecipitated by anti VSV-G tag antiserum. Anti VSV-G tag immunoprecipitates were washed four times in Nonidet P-40 containing buffer and twice with kinase buffer (25 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, 10 mm MnCl2) and then incubated at room temperature for 5 min in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 0.5 μm of [γ-32P]ATP (specific radioactivity, 20 mCi/mmol) and 20 ng of GST-Band III. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer containing 200 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA and boiling for 5 min. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were treated with KOH 1 m for 1 h at 55 °C and dried before autoradiography. An aliquot of each sample was used to quantify the amount of immunoprecipitated proteins, by immunoblotting with an anti ZAP-70 antiserum (4.06) and probing the Western blots with125I-labeled protein A. In both the kinase assay and the protein quantitation, radiolabeled bands corresponding to ZAP-70 (ZAP-70 WT and ZAP-70-Y319EEI) or the phosphorylated GST-Band III were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by using Image Quant software after scanning in a PhosphorImager (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The similar phenotype displayed by Y319F and Y493F ZAP-70 mutants (7Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.-H. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T.

Thome M. Herve F. Acuto O. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 18Straus D.B. Chan A.C. Patai B. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9976-9981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), suggested that Tyr319 could be a binding site for the LckSH2. However, this residue is located in the motif YSDP (Fig.1), which considerably diverges from YEEI, an optimal binding sequence for the SH2 domain of Src PTKs (19Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.J. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar). Thus, we used molecular modeling to address the question of whether the sequence YSDP could fit the LckSH2-binding site. The molecular modeling was based on the crystallographic atomic coordinates of the LckSH2-pYEEI peptide complex (25Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). To avoid any bias, this model was built with no other information than the structure of the LckSH2 domain, with the pY residue lodged in its binding pocket (for further details see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig.2, the structural resemblance between the built pYSDP peptide (yellow in the figure) and the pYEEI (gray in the figure) was striking. The backbone of the two peptides almost superimposed, with a root mean square deviation for the Cα of residues Y+1, Y+2, and Y+3 of 0.48 Å. This was also the case for the side chains of the proline residue +3 of the YSDP peptide and the side chain of the isoleucine +3 of the YEEI peptide, fitting on the Y+3 binding pocket (root mean square deviation for the Cβ and Cγ of the side chains of the Y+3 proline and isoleucine residues of 0.47 Å). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2 B, the aspartate side chain of the residue Y+2 of the YSDP peptide would be in a favorable position for interacting with the arginine RβD′1 of the LckSH2. The data from this molecular modeling show that the binding pocket of LckSH2 can accommodate the YSDP motif, suggesting that no structural constraints would impede this intermolecular interaction. To confirm the prediction arising from the molecular modeling,i.e. that Y319SDP could bind to LckSH2, we initially carried out a series of competition experiments, employing a previously described binding assay (11Duplay P.

https://openalex.org/W2040989466,"C3G is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rap1 and is activated by the expression of Crk adaptor proteins. We found that expression of CrkI in COS cells induced significant tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G. To understand the mechanism by which C3G is phosphorylated and activated by Crk, we constructed a series of deletion mutants. Deletion of the amino terminus of C3G to amino acid 61 did not remarkably affect either tyrosine phosphorylation or Crk-dependent activation of C3G. When C3G was truncated to amino acid 390, C3G was still phosphorylated on tyrosine but was not effectively activated by CrkI. Deletion of the amino terminus of C3G to amino acid 579 significantly reduced the Crk-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G and increased GTP-bound Rap1 irrespective of the presence of CrkI. We substituted all seven tyrosine residues in this region, amino acids 391–579, for phenylalanine for identification of the phosphorylation site. Among the substitution mutants, the C3G-Y504F mutant, in which tyrosine 504 was substituted by phenylalanine, was remarkably less activated and phosphorylated than the wild type. All the other substitution mutants were activated and tyrosyl-phosphorylated by the expression of CrkI. Thus, CrkI activates C3G by the phosphorylation of tyrosine 504, which represses thecis-acting negative regulatory domain outside the catalytic region. C3G is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rap1 and is activated by the expression of Crk adaptor proteins.

Deletion of the amino terminus of C3G to amino acid 579 significantly reduced the Crk-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G and increased GTP-bound Rap1 irrespective of the presence of CrkI. We substituted all seven tyrosine residues in this region, amino acids 391–579, for phenylalanine for identification of the phosphorylation site. Among the substitution mutants, the C3G-Y504F mutant, in which tyrosine 504 was substituted by phenylalanine, was remarkably less activated and phosphorylated than the wild type. All the other substitution mutants were activated and tyrosyl-phosphorylated by the expression of CrkI. Thus, CrkI activates C3G by the phosphorylation of tyrosine 504, which represses thecis-acting negative regulatory domain outside the catalytic region. C3G was originally isolated as one of the two major proteins bound to the SH3 1The abbreviations used are: SH3, Srchomology 3; SH2, Src homology 2; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 1The abbreviations used are: SH3, Srchomology 3; SH2, Src homology 2; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis domain of the Crk adaptor protein (1Knudsen B.S.

The carboxyl-terminal region, which shares a homologous sequence with CDC25, catalyzes the guanine-nucleotide exchange reaction for Rap1, a Ras family protein, but not for the other Ras-family G proteins (3Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In the central part of C3G, three Crk SH3-binding sequences have been identified (1Knudsen B.S. Feller S.M. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32781-32787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Matsuda M. Ota S. Tanimura R. Nakamura H. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Nagashima K. Kurata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14468-14472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although the function of the amino-terminal region of C3G remains unknown, recently p130 cas, a major Crk SH2-binding protein, has been shown to bind in this region in vitro (5Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25673-25679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The human crk gene is translated into two products, CrkI and CrkII, by alternative splicing (6Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). CrkII is regulated negatively by tyrosine phosphorylation, which occurs upon various types of stimulation (7Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 8Hashimoto Y. Katayama H. Kiyokawa E. Ota S. Kurata T. Gotoh N. Shibata M. Otsuka N. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17186-17191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). CrkI, by contrast, lacks the tyrosine phosphorylation site and resembles the v-crk oncogene product in its structure (6Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 9Mayer B.J. Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 332: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Many kinds of stimulation induce binding of the Crk-C3G complex to a variety of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, such as receptor tyrosine kinases (reviewed in Ref. 10Kiyokawa E. Mochizuki N. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Crit. Rev. Oncogenesis. 1997; 8: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the biological consequences of the activation of C3G are still poorly understood, mostly because the function of Rap1, the only known effector of C3G, is obscure. Rap1 competitively suppresses Ras-dependent transformation and ERK/MAP kinase activation (11Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 12Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the sustained activation of Rap1, probably due to the formation of the Cbl-CrkL-C3G complex, causes T-cell anergy by suppressing the Ras-MAP kinase pathway (13Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Barber D.L. Nadler L.M. Science. 1997; 278: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, however, Rap1, like Ras, activates the ERK/MAP kinase pathway through the activation of B-raf (14Ohtsuka T. Shimizu K. Yamamori B. Kuroda S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1258-1261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 15Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S.

Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). In platelets, an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration activates Rap1, which in turn binds to and activates RalGDS (17Franke B. Akkerman J.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 15: 252-259Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Recently we have isolated a novel guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rap1, CalDAGI (18Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J. Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). CalDAGI can be activated by Ca2+ and diacylglycerol; therefore, the Ca2+-dependent activation of Rap1 appears to be triggered by CalDAGI, but not C3G. It has been reported that C3G activates JNK through SEK (19Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Mixed-lineage kinases, MLK3 and DLK, appear to be involved in this pathway (20Tanaka S. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1281-1284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because constitutively active Rap1 does not activate JNK and because dominant-negative Rap1 does not inhibit the C3G-dependent activation of JNK, it has been proposed that another G protein may transduce signals to JNK from C3G. Activation of C3G occurs primarily through membrane recruitment (10Kiyokawa E. Mochizuki N. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Crit. Rev. Oncogenesis. 1997; 8: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,21Ichiba T. Kuraishi Y. Sakai O. Nagata S. Groffen J. Kurata T. Hattori S. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22215-22220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Expression of CrkI in COS cells activates guanine nucleotide exchange activity of C3G, concomitant with its translocation to the cell membrane (22Olayioye M.A. Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Rohrer J. Gay B. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5042-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). An SH2 mutant of CrkI, which is not translocated to the membrane, cannot activate C3G; however, addition of a farnesylation signal to this SH2 mutant restored the CrkI-dependent activation of C3G partially. Deletion of the amino-terminal third activates C3G to the level of C3G co-expressed with Crk. These observations strongly suggest the presence of a cis-acting negative regulatory domain in the noncatalytic domain of C3G. In the present paper, we delineate the negative regulatory domain and the tyrosine phosphorylation site of C3G. pCAGGS-CrkI encodes the wild-type human CrkI (21Ichiba T. Kuraishi Y. Sakai O. Nagata S. Groffen J. Kurata T. Hattori S. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22215-22220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). CrkI-R38V and CrkI-W169L are SH2 and SH3 mutants, respectively (21Ichiba T. Kuraishi Y. Sakai O. Nagata S. Groffen J. Kurata T. Hattori S. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22215-22220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). pCAGGS-C3G and pCAGGS-C3G-F express the wild-type and the farnesylated form of C3G, respectively (3Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). pEBG-Rap1 and pEBG-C3G encode GST-tagged Rap1 and C3G, respectively (2Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Takenawa T. Matuoka K. Shibuya M. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Full-length and truncated C3G cDNAs were obtained by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the pCAGGS-His expression vector, which contains the polyhistidine-tag sequence derived from pBlueBacHisA (Invitrogen) at the 5′ end of the cloning site. pCAGGS-His-C3G-d61 encodes C3G from amino acid 62 to the carboxyl end; -d390 from 391; and -d579 from 580. In other C3G expression vectors, a tyrosine codon(s) was substituted into that of phenylalanine by polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis. Substituted tyrosines are indicated by superscripts; the vectors are pCAGGS-C3G-Tyr504, pCAGGS-C3G-Tyr554,561,570, and pCAGGS-C3G-Tyr478,485,579. COS1 (CCL 1651, ATCC), 3Y1 rat fibroblast (0734, Japan Cell Resource Bank (JCRB)), v-crk-transformed 3Y1 cells, Crk-3Y1 (23Matsuda M. Mayer B.J. Fukui Y. Hanafusa H. Science. 1990; 248: 1537-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), SR-3Y1 v-src-transformed 3Y1 cells (0742, JCRB), and HR-3Y1 v-Ha-ras-transformed cells (0734, JCRB) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui, Tokyo) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. COS1 cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method. Antibodies against C3G and Crk were developed in our laboratory (2Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Takenawa T. Matuoka K. Shibuya M. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 6Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Anti-Crk monoclonal antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody RC20 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY; anti-C3G polyclonal antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. Guanine nucleotides bound to Rap1 were analyzed essentially as described previously (24Muroya K. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 277-281PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 105 COS1 cells plated on 35-mm dishes were transfected with 0.2 μg of expression plasmids by the DEAE-dextran method. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were labeled for 2 h with 0.05 mCi of32Pi in 0.5 ml of phosphate-free medium. GST-fused Rap1 was collected by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Guanine nucleotides bound to Rap1 were separated by thin layer chromatography and quantitated with a Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). For analysis of protein expression, cells were processed similarly without isotopic labeling. Cleared lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, probed with antibodies, and detected by an ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) and cleared by centrifugation. Equal amounts of lysates were incubated with various antibodies at 4 °C. The immune complexes were collected by protein A-Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo). In some experiments, SDS was added at 1%, incubated at 95 °C for 3 min, and diluted 10-fold with lysis buffer, followed by immunoprecipitation by the use of anti-C3G antibody and protein A-Sepharose FF. The immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting as described (21Ichiba T. Kuraishi Y. Sakai O. Nagata S. Groffen J. Kurata T. Hattori S. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22215-22220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Previously, we proposed that CrkI activates C3G primarily by recruiting C3G to the membrane fraction (21Ichiba T. Kuraishi Y. Sakai O. Nagata S. Groffen J. Kurata T. Hattori S. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22215-22220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We examined whether the translocation to the membrane is sufficient for the activation of C3G by use of a C3G mutant, C3G-F, which localizes mainly in the membrane fraction due to farnesylation (Fig. 1, A andB). The wild-type C3G and C3G-F increased GTP-Rap1 from 8% to 17% and to 16%, respectively. As we discussed previously (21Ichiba T. Kuraishi Y. Sakai O. Nagata S. Groffen J. Kurata T. Hattori S. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22215-22220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the protein level of C3G-F is always significantly lower than that of the wild type (Fig. 1 C). Considering the protein expression level, the specific activity of the farnesylated C3G was 4.5-fold higher than that of the wild-type C3G (Fig. 1 D). Co-expression of CrkI enhanced Rap1 activation by C3G-F as well as the wild-type C3G, suggesting that membrane recruitment is not the sole mechanism of C3G activation by CrkI. In these experiments, we found that the activation of C3G was accompanied by its tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1 C). Because the farnesylated C3G also became tyrosine-phosphorylated by CrkI expression, we speculated that tyrosine phosphorylation plays a major role in the activation of C3G. To examine further the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G, we used two CrkI mutants, CrkI-R38V and CrkI-W169L. The SH2 mutant CrkI-R38V and the SH3 mutant CrkI-W169L are unable to activate C3G (21Ichiba T. Kuraishi Y. Sakai O. Nagata S. Groffen J. Kurata T. Hattori S. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22215-22220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant CrkI proteins were expressed to a similar level and did not affect the expression of C3G (Fig. 2 A); however, only the wild-type CrkI induced detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G (Fig. 2 B). The CrkI-W169L did not bind to CrkI due to its SH3 mutation, and CrkI-R38V could not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G due to its SH2 mutation (Fig. 2 C). To confirm that the 135-kDa protein detected by the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was C3G, we used GST-tagged C3G (Fig. 2 C). In the cells expressing GST-C3G, we observed a molecular shift of the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein to the 160-kDa region, as expected from the molecular mass, 28 kDa, of GST. We next searched for conditions in which the endogenous C3G is phosphorylated on tyrosine. We examined a series of 3Y1 rat fibroblasts transformed by oncogenes for the tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G. As shown in Fig.3 A, we found a prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated 135-kDa protein in the anti-C3G immune complexes from 3Y1 cells transformed by v-crk or v-src, but not from parent 3Y1 cells and Ha-Ras-transformed 3Y1 cells. Several proteins of some 130 kDa are known to be phosphorylated on tyrosine in cells transformed by v-Crk or v-Src (25Hamaguchi M. Matsuda M. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To remove these proteins from anti-C3G immune complexes, we denatured the cell lysates before immunoprecipitation. Under this condition, most, if not all, phosphotyrosine-binding domains such as SH2 cannot refold. 2Y. Hashimoto, M. Nakaya, and M. Matsuda, unpublished results. Even with this treatment, the 135-kDa phosphotyrosine-containing protein was precipitated with the anti-C3G antibody (Fig. 3 B). Thus, we concluded that C3G is phosphorylated on tyrosine in cells transformed by v-Crk or v-Src. We constructed C3G mutants and examined them for their CrkI-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation. Only representative examples are shown in Figs.4 and 5. C3G-d390 was the shortest among the deletion mutants that were phosphorylated on tyrosine under the presence of CrkI. C3G-d579, deleted to amino acid 579, almost completely lost its tyrosine phosphorylation. C3G-d579 retained its binding to CrkI, as expected from the presence of the major CrkI-binding site, amino acids 588–617 (4Matsuda M. Ota S. Tanimura R. Nakamura H. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Nagashima K. Kurata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14468-14472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our data showed 7 tyrosine residues between amino acids 391 and 579 as candidates for tyrosine phosphorylation site(s). We constantly observed a 120-kDa phosphotyrosine-containing protein co-imunoprecipitated with C3G. It did not react with anti-p130 cas antibody and remained unidentified at this moment.Figure 5Phosphorylation and binding of the C3G mutants to CrkI. 293T cells expressing the proteins indicated on the top were lysed and immunoprecipitated with either anti-Crk monoclonal antibody 3A8 or anti-C3G antibody and probed with antibodies as indicated on the bottom. Arrowsindicate the positions of the wild-type and C3G-d390 mutant proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The activity of the guanine nucleotide exchange reaction for Rap1 was also examined for C3G deletion mutants with or without the expression of CrkI (Fig. 6). The guanine nucleotide exchange activities of C3G-d61 and C3G-d390 were similar to those of the wild-type C3G, and both were activated by the co-expression of CrkI. In contrast, C3G-d579 showed the highest basal guanine nucleotide exchange activity to the level of the wild-type C3G co-expressed with CrkI. As shown in Fig. 5, the expression level of C3G-d579 was similar to that of the wild-type C3G; therefore, C3G-d579 appears to be a catalytically active mutant. The activity of C3G-d579 was not enhanced further by the expression of CrkI. These results demonstrate that both the tyrosine phosphorylation site(s) and the negative regulatory region of C3G are between amino acids 391 and 579. We substituted all of the seven tyrosine residues for phenylalanine to identify the tyrosine residue that is critical for phosphorylation and CrkI-dependent activation (Figs. 4 and7). Results for three representative mutants, among several mutants tested, are shown in Fig. 7. Two mutants, C3G-Y554F/Y561F/Y570F and C3G-Y478F/Y485F/Y579F, which have three amino acid substitutions, were tyrosine-phosphorylated by the expression of CrkI, as was the wild-type C3G. However, tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G-Y504F was increased significantly by CrkI (Fig.7 A). The activation of the guanine nucleotide exchange for Rap1 by these C3G mutants correlated with the tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 7, B and C). Both C3G-Y554F/Y561F/Y570F and C3G-Y478F/Y485F/Y579F were activated by the expression of CrkI, as was the wild-type C3G. In contrast, the activation of the C3G-Y504F mutant by CrkI was marginal. These data demonstrate that tyrosine 504 is the most critical tyrosine residue for the phosphorylation and CrkI-dependent activation of the guanine nucleotide exchange for Rap1. We have shown that the increase in the catalytic activity of C3G correlated with its tyrosine phosphorylation. Amino acid substitution of Tyr-504 to Phe renders C3G refractory to CrkI-dependent activation and phosphorylation. Removal of the amino-terminal region, including Tyr-504, generated a C3G mutant that was fully active irrespective of the presence of CrkI; therefore, we concluded that CrkI-induced phosphorylation of Tyr-504 represses thecis-acting negative regulatory domain of C3G. It should be noted, however, that even the C3G-Y504F mutant was also activated slightly by CrkI. Because Y504F was still phosphorylated weakly on tyrosine, tyrosine phosphorylation of other residue(s) may replace the function of Y504F phosphorylation. Alternatively, C3G may be activated by CrkI via a phosphorylation-independent mechanism. Recently, p130 cas, crk-associatedsubstrate, has been shown to bind directly to C3G (5Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25673-25679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Pro-267 and Pro-270 of C3G are essential for the binding of the SH3 domain of p130 cas. When we deleted this region in the C3G-d390 mutant, C3G could not be activated effectively by the expression of Crk, even though C3G-d390 is tyrosyl-phosphorylated to a similar extent as the wild-type C3G (Fig. 6). Thus, binding of p130 cas may be required for optimal activation of C3G after the phosphorylation of Tyr-504. Many of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the Ras family are also regulated negatively by the domain(s) outside the catalytic region. The in vitro activity of the full-length CDC25Mm/Ras-GRF was 25 times lower than that of the catalytic domain consisting of the carboxyl-terminal 285 amino acid residues (26Baouz S. Jacquet E. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6671-6676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that CDC25Mm/Ras-GRF is activated either by phosphorylation or by calmodulin binding (27Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 28Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that phosphorylation and/or calmodulin binding represses the negative regulatory domain of CDC25Mm/Ras-GRF. The nature of the phosphorylation of Ras-GRF was not reported previously; however, it does not seem to be tyrosine phosphorylation, because protein phosphatase 1 effectively inhibited Ras-GRF (27Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Similarly to the situation for CDC25Mm/Ras-GRF, deletion of either the amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal regions of Sos, the catalytic domain of which resides in the center, promotes the guanine nucleotide reaction of Sos more efficiently than does the full-length Sos protein (29Qian X. Vass W.C. Papageorge A.G. Anborgh P.H. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Corbalan-Garcia S. Margarit S.M. Galron D. Yang S.S. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); thus, both the amino and carboxyl termini of Sos function as cis-acting negative regulatory domains. It has also been shown that the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains inhibit allosterically the association of the catalytic domain of Sos with the Ras protein (30Corbalan-Garcia S. Margarit S.M. Galron D. Yang S.S. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Altogether, the general scheme can be deduced that the catalytic activity of the guanine nucleotide exchange proteins for Ras-family proteins is regulated by one or more cis-acting negative regulatory elements. The negative regulation is repressed by various mechanisms such as phosphorylation, calmodulin binding, calcium binding, or diacylglycerol binding. The physiologic relevance of the tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G awaits further study. However, we observed tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G in cells transformed by v-crk or v-src. Because C3G enhances the v-crk-dependent transformation, it is likely that the v-Crk-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G plays a significant role in the oncogenic process (19Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Compared with the number of proteins known to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon various types of stimulation, the number of the enzymes that can be activated by tyrosine phosphorylation are not numerous except for the tyrosine kinases themselves. Phospholipase C-γ appears to be the first enzyme that was shown to be activated upon in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation (31Nishibe S. Wahl M.I. Hernandez-Sotomayer S.M.T. Tonks N.K. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. Science. 1990; 250: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Vav, which is a member of the Dbl family of proteins and promotes the guanine nucleotide exchange of Rac, is recruited to tyrosine kinases and is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation (32Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). C3G has become the first example of guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Ras family proteins that can be activated by tyrosine phosphorylation. While we were revising this manuscript, the cloning ofDrosophila C3G was reported (33Ishimaru S. Williams R. Clark E. Hanafusa H. Gaul U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence of the central part of human C3G, which includes Crk-binding sites and the tyrosine 504, does not show significant homology with that ofDrosophila C3G; while the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain and the amino-terminal region represent high sequence homology. Even so, we have found that the sequence surrounding tyrosine 504, Lys-Pro-Tyr-Ala, is conserved between the human andDrosophila C3Gs. This finding suggests that theDrosophila C3G may also be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. We thank S. Hattori, T. Gotoh, and J. Miyazaki for materials and technical advice.

https://openalex.org/W1968646220,"M-SemF is a membrane-associated, neurally enriched member of the semaphorin family of axon guidance signals. We considered whether the cytoplasmic domain of M-SemF might possess a signaling function and/or might control the distribution of M-SemF on the cell surface. We identify a PDZ-containing neural protein as an M-SemF cytoplasmic domain-associated protein (SEMCAP-1). SEMCAP-2 is a closely related nonneuronal protein. SEMCAP-1 has recently also been identified as GIPC, by virtue of its interaction with the RGS protein GAIP in vitro (De Vries, L., Lou, X., Zhao, G., Zheng, B., and Farquhar, M. G. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 12340–12345). Expression studies support the notion that SEMCAP-1(GIPC) interacts with M-SemF, but not GAIP, in brain. Lung SEMCAP-2 and SEMCAP-1(GIPC) are potential partners for both GAIP and M-SemF. The protein interaction requires the single PDZ domain of SEMCAP-1(GIPC) and the carboxyl-terminal four residues of M-SemF, ESSV. While SEMCAP-1(GIPC) also interacts with SemC, it does not interact with other proteins containing a class I PDZ binding motif, nor does M-SemF interact with other class I PDZ proteins. Co-expression of SEMCAP-1(GIPC) induces the redistribution of dispersed M-SemF into detergent-resistant aggregates in HEK293 cells. Thus, SEMCAP-1(GIPC) appears to regulate the subcellular distribution of M-SemF in brain, and SEMCAPs could link M-SemF to G protein signal transduction pathways.

The creation and refinement of highly specific neuronal connections is essential for the function of vertebrate nervous systems. The molecular mechanisms guiding axonal extension and synapse formation are becoming better understood. Pioneering studies demonstrated the general importance of neurotrophic factors and cell adhesion molecules in supporting neurite outgrowth (1Reichardt L.F. Farinas I. Cowan W.M. Jessell T.M. Zipursky S.L. Molecular and Cellular Approaches to Neural Development. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 220-263Google Scholar, 2Chiba A. Keshishian H. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). More recent studies have defined additional pathway-specific roles for the netrins, ephrins, and semaphorins (3Goodman C.S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 341-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Semaphorins are an expanding family of glycoproteins expressed in the nervous system and in many somatic tissues. There are more than 20 semaphorins reported at the present time (4Puschel A.W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). While they may have diverse functions ranging from vasculogenesis (5Behar O. Golden J.A. Mashimo H. Schoen F.J. Fishman M.C.

Members of the semaphorin family feature an extracellular Sema domain of 500 amino acid residues with multiple conserved cysteine residues (9Kolodkin A.L. Matthews D.J. Goodman C.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1389-1399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Collapsin-1 (semaphorin III/D), a secreted semaphorin, was initially purified from chick brain as a potent inducer of dorsal root ganglion neuronal growth cone collapse (10Luo Y. Raible D. Raper J.A.

Analyses of mice with targeted SemIII(D) gene deletions have verified the role of the protein as a repulsive signal for selected sensory neurons in the peripheral nervous system (5Behar O. Golden J.A. Mashimo H. Schoen F.J. Fishman M.C. Nature. 1996; 383: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 17Taniguchi M. Yuasa S. Fujisawa H. Naruse I. Saga S. Mishina M. Yagi T. Neuron. 1997; 19: 519-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis has divided semaphorins into at least six groups. Group II and group III are secreted semaphorins. Group VI semaphorins associate with plasma membrane via a GPI linkage (18Xu X. Ng S. Wu Z.-L. Nguyen D. Homburger S. Seidel-Dugan C. Ebens A. Luo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22428-22434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Groups I, IV, and V, which represent about half of known semaphorins, contain transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Since they are integral membrane proteins, these transmembrane semaphorins are thought to provide contact-mediated guidance cues to developing neurons. There is only limited evidence concerning specific physiologic roles for transmembrane semaphorins. Antibody blockade of G-Sema I, a grasshopper transmembrane semaphorin, interferes with Ti1 neuron axonal pathfinding in the limb bud (19Kolodkin A.L. Matthes D.J. O'Connor T.P. Patel N.H. Admon A. Bentley D. Goodman C.S. Neuron. 1992; 9: 831-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis of its Drosophilahomologue, D-Sema I, suggests that it may also function as a repulsive signal for selected motor and central nervous system axons (20Yu H.-H. Araj H.H. Ralls S.A. Kolodkin A.L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 207-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Although expression of a secreted derivative of D-Sema I with a truncated tail partially complements a loss of function mutation of D-Sema I (20Yu H.-H. Araj H.H. Ralls S.A. Kolodkin A.L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 207-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), several recent reports suggest that the cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane semaphorins may contribute to their biological functions. M-SemaG (h-CD100), which regulates B lymphocyte differentiation, associates with a serine kinase through its cytoplasmic domain (21Elhabazi A. Lang V. Herold C. Freeman G.J. Bensussan A. Boumsell L. Bismuth G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23515-23520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Mouse SemaVIb forms a complex with c-Src through a proline-rich intracellular domain (22Eckhardt F. Behar O. Calautti E. Yonezawa K. Nishimoto I. Fishman M.C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These data raise the possibility that the transmembrane semaphorins may function as receptors, as well as ligands, and transduce extracellular binding events to cytoplasmic changes. Alternatively, the cytoplasmic domains may control the spatial distribution and hence ligand activity of transmembrane semaphorins. The activity of secreted collapsin (SemIII/D) requires dimerization and proteolytic activation (23Klostermann A. Lohrum M. Adams R.H. Puschel A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7326-7331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 24Koppel A.M. Raper J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15708-15713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The clustering of ephrins due to membrane anchorage is critical for the activation of Eph receptors and their biological activities (25Davis S. Gale N.W. Aldrich T.H. Maisonpierre P.C. Lhotak V. Pawson T. Goldfarb M. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 266: 816-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). M-SemF is a transmembrane semaphorin of unknown function identified by its homology in the Sema domain (26Inagaki S. Furuyama T. Iwahashi Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The predicted cytoplasmic portion of M-SemF, 146 amino acids in length, contains a proline-rich region that includes the consensus sequence for interaction with Src homology 3 domains as well as cytoskeletal proteins. In this report, we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of M-SemF associates specifically with two related intracellular proteins containing single PDZ domains. We isolated these proteins as M-SemFcytoplasmic domain-associatedproteins (SEMCAP-1 and SEMCAP-2). 1The abbreviations used are: SEMCAP-1 and -2, M-SemF cytoplasmic domain-associated protein 1 and 2, respectively; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; DPBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; kb, kilobase pair(s); PSD, postsynaptic density/densities; TIP, Tax interacting protein clone 2 SEMCAP-1 is identical to GIPC, a protein interacting with the RGS protein GAIP (27De Vries L. Lou X. Zhao G. Zheng B. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12340-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Thus, SEMCAP(GIPC) may regulate the distribution of M-SemF and link a semaphorin to G protein signaling cascades.

The IMAGE Consortium expressed sequence tag cDNA clones were from Genome Systems Inc. (St. Louis, MO). The fusion protein expression vectors, pGBT-SEMF, pGBT-SEMF, and pGAD-SEMF, contain sequence for amino acid residues 689–834 of mouse M-SemF in pGEX5X-3, pGBT9, and pGAD424, respectively. pGBT-SEMB contains sequence for amino acid residues 705–760 of mouse SemB in pGBT9 and was prepared with a PCR fragment amplified from a plasmid containing SemB cDNA using primers GCGAATTCCCACTGGGGGCGCTG and CCTCGAGTCACCACAGAATCCC. pGBT-SEMC contains sequence for 95 amino acids from the carboxyl end of mouse SemC in pGBT9 and was prepared with a PCR fragment amplified from a mouse E17 cDNA library using primers CCCGGGCATGAAACTCTTCCTAAAGC and CCCGGGTCATACCACAGAGTCTCGG. pGAD-NR2C contains amino acid residues 1046–1250 of rat NMDA glutamate receptor subunit 2C (NR2C) in pGAD10 and was derived from a XhoI–EcoRI cDNA fragment of plasmid pNR2C4 (U08259). pGBT-PDZ1–3 and pGAD-PDZ1–3 contain sequences for amino acid residues 1–460 of rat postsynaptic density (PSD)-95 in pGBT9 and pGAD424 and were prepared with a PCR fragment amplified from the PSD-95 cDNA (28Cho K.-O.

The M-SEMF cytoplasmic domain mutant constructs, pGEX-SEMF-831, pGEX-SEMF-S832A, pGEX-SEMF-S832D, and pGEX-SEMF-V834A, were prepared with PCR fragments amplified from pGAD-SEMF using a forward primer based on the vector sequence and the reverse primers GCGAATTCACTCCTCTGGGTTGGAGTC, GCGAATTCATACTGAAGCCTCCTCTGG, GCGAATTCATGCTGAAGACTCCTCTGG, and GCGAATTCATACTGAATCCTCCTCTGG, respectively. The mutations have been confirmed by DNA sequencing. pGBT-SEMCAP-1(GIPC), pGAD-SEMCAP-1(GIPC), and pCMVMycSEMCAP-1(GIPC) contain the full-length coding region of SEMCAP-1(GIPC) plus an additional 16 amino acid residues before the initiation methionine in pGBT9, pGAD10, and pCMVMyc, respectively. pGBT-SEMCAP-2 and pGAD-SEMCAP-2 contain the full-length coding region of SEMCAP-2 with an additional 2 amino acid residues before the initiation methionine in pGBT9 and pGAD424. The expression vector pGBT-GAIP containing full-length coding region of GAIP was prepared with a PCR fragment amplified from a mouse E17 cDNA library using primers GAATTCATGCCCACCCCACATGAGG and GGATCCCTAGGCCTCAGAGGACTGTGG. The mammalian expression vectors pcDNA- M-SEMF, pcDNA-SEMCAP-1(GIPC), and pcDNA-SEMCAP-2 consist of the full-length coding region of the indicated proteins in pcDNA I (Invitrogen). The procedure for yeast two-hybrid analysis has been described previously (29Wang L.-H. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2261-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In brief, yeast reporter strain Hf7C was sequentially transformed with pGBT-SEMF and a mouse E17 cDNA library cloned in the pGAD10 vector. Colonies that grew under triple selection (Leu−, Trp−, His−) conditions were assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Library-derived plasmids from LacZ-positive yeast cells were recovered and purified for further analyses. Liquid β-galactosidase activities were assayed with doubly transformed SFY526 yeast reporter cells using o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as the substrate. The DNA sequence analysis of isolated clones was carried out utilizing the fluorescently conjugated dideoxynucleotide termination method with a thermal cycling protocol on automatic DNA sequencers (Applied Biosystems model 377) at the W. M. Keck Biotechnology Laboratory of Yale University. Cellular RNA was extracted from indicated murine tissues using the acid guanidium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63183) Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of total RNA were separated on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary elution with 20× SSC. SEMCAPs and M-SemF cDNA probes were prepared by random priming with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. Hybridization was performed as described previously (31Wang L.-H. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6197-6207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Washed nylon membranes were exposed to Kodak BioMax film for 12–36 h with a Kodak BioMax MS intensifying screen at −80 °C. Glutathione S-transferase (GST), GST-SEMF, and GST-SEMF mutant fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified on glutathione-agarose beads as described (32Wang L.-H. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10079-10083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Recombinant SEMCAP proteins were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells by calcium phosphate transfection using 20 μg each of pCMVMycSEMCAP-1(GIPC), pcDNA-SEMCAP-1(GIPC), and pcDNA-SEMCAP-2, respectively. Forty eight hours following transfection, cells were resuspended in 1–3 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, pH 7.4) plus 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μm leupeptin. The cytosol was collected after three freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm (30,000 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C. Aliquots (300 μl) of cytosol were incubated with 100 μg of the designated fusion proteins immobilized on 20-μl glutathione-agarose beads for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of DPBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The bound proteins were eluted in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer, and 20-μl aliquots were used for immunoblot analyses. Brain cytosol was prepared by homogenizing mouse brain in 2.5 ml of DPBS/g of tissue followed by centrifuging at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant brain cytosol was collected and utilized for the in vitro binding assay as described above. The antisera against M-SemF were prepared using GST-SEMF as the immunogen. Rabbits were initially immunized with 100 μg of GST-SEMF fusion protein mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant and were boosted with 100 μg of GST-SEMF in incomplete Freund's adjuvant at 3–6-week intervals. For anti-SEMCAP-1(GIPC) antisera, the rabbits were immunized with purified MycSEMCAP-1(GIPC) fusion proteins from transfected HEK293 cells with high level expression of the fusion protein. With high level expression, the fusion protein forms a 1 m NaCl and 1% Triton X-100-insoluble complex. The pellet from centrifugation in NaCl/Triton X-100 at 30,000 × g for 15 min contained MycSEMCAP-1(GIPC) fusion protein of >95% purity as judged by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE. Such pellets were sonicated in DPBS and used for the immunization using the same protocol as for GST-M-SEMF. The immunization service was performed at the Yale Animal Resource Center. The immunoblotting procedure was carried out as described by Wang and Strittmatter (29Wang L.-H. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2261-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The anti-M-SemF antisera were used at a 1:2500 dilution. The anti-SEMCAP-1(GIPC) antisera were used at a 1:2000 dilution. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using TMB peroxidase substrate reagents (Vector), after incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG. HEK293T cells were cotransfected by the calcium phosphate method with the pCMVMycSEMCAP-1(GIPC) and pcDNA-M-SEMF plasmids, 10 μg of each plasmid/100-mm plate. Twenty four hours following transfection, cells from one 100-mm plate were solubilized in 5 ml of lysis buffer (DPBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 1 h at 4 °C. One-ml aliquots were centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000 rpm (30,000 × g) at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 25 μl of undiluted anti-M-SemF or anti-SEMCAP-1(GIPC) or preimmune sera. The samples were then incubated for an additional 2 h with 20 μl of Protein G-agarose beads at 4 °C. After extensive washing of the beads with lysis buffer, the bound proteins were solubilized in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblot with the anti-M-SemF antiserum and 9E10 monoclonal antibody. Transfected HEK293T cells or rat E15 cortical cells (33Takahashi T. Nakamura F. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9183-9193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured on coverslips for 48 h and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) for 1 h at room temperature. Fixed cells were treated sequentially with permeabilization solution (0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate buffer) and blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffer) and then were incubated with primary antibodies in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C, followed by a 1-h incubation with secondary antibodies at room temperature. After each antibody incubation, cells were washed four times in phosphate buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 15 min. Anti-M-SemF serum, anti-SEMCAP-1(GIPC) serum, and 9E10 ascites fluid were each used at 1:1000 dilution. The secondary antibodies, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated IgG fraction of goat anti-rabbit IgG and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated IgG fraction of goat-anti-mouse IgG, were diluted 1:100. After antibody incubations, coverslips were rinsed in distilled water and mounted on glass slides. Immunofluorescence was captured using either a CCD camera (Astrocam TE3) or a laser scanning confocal image system (MRC600, Bio-Rad), and digital images were processed with Adobe Photoshop software. Brains from 2-day-old rats (1.25 g) were homogenized in a glass homogenizer with 3 ml of DPBS. Membrane fractions were collected by centrifuging at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Brain membranes were rehomogenized in 3 ml of DPBS and collected by centrifugation. Washed membranes were homogenized again in 12 ml of DPBS, and Triton X-100 (TX-100) was added slowly to a final concentration of 1%, followed by a 1-h incubation at 4 °C. Insoluble membrane fractions were collected by centrifugation and re-extracted with 1% TX-100 in DPBS. The final membrane pellet was resuspended in DPBS and frozen at −80 °C. For transfected cell membranes, HEK293T cell membranes were treated with DPBS containing 1% TX-100 for 1 h on ice. Particulate fractions were collected by centrifuging at 13,000 rpm (30,000 × g) for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting membrane pellet was sonicated in DPBS containing 1% TX-100 and incubated for 1 h on ice. Insoluble membrane fractions were collected by centrifugation as described above. Brain membrane proteins and 293 cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with 5% dry milk in TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with purified MycSEMCAP-1 fusion protein (8 μg/ml) that had been preincubated with a 1:2500 dilution of anti-SEMCAP antiserum for 2 h at room temperature. The bound MycSEMCAP-1-antibody complexes were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and visualized with TMB peroxidase substrate reagents. To explore possible functions of M-SemF, we analyzed its mRNA and protein expression pattern in the mouse. Northern analysis reveals that M-SemF mRNA is expressed primarily in the nervous system. The mRNA is detected in lung at much lower levels, whereas expression in kidney, liver, heart, and skeletal muscle is almost undetectable (Fig.1 A). The expression of M-SemF is first apparent at E12 and persists through adulthood at nearly constant levels. This raises the possibility that M-SemF participates both in axon guidance during development and in synaptic plasticity of the adult central nervous system. An antiserum generated against a GST/M-SemF cytoplasmic tail fusion protein specifically recognizes an M r 100,000 protein in M-SemF-expressing HEK293T cell membranes but not in control 293T cell membranes (Fig. 1 B). The same protein species is detected by immunoblot analysis of brain membranes. Coincident with the mRNA distribution, the expression of M-SemF protein is neurally restricted and continues into adulthood. Any protein expected to interact with M-SemF should exhibit an overlapping pattern of expression. To search for cellular proteins that may interact with the cytoplasmic domain of M-SemF, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a E17 mouse cDNA library with a fusion protein expressing the GAL4 DNA binding domain and the cytoplasmic tail of M-SemF (residues 689–834) as bait. From 8 × 106colonies, 22 clones were obtained that activate the expression of a β-galactosidase reporter gene. Two clones were false positives that encoded transcription factors interacting with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain itself. Fifteen of the 22 clones derived from the same cDNA and interacted specifically with the M-SemF cytoplasmic domain (Fig.2 A). The other five specifically interacting clones were derived from a single cDNA encoding a novel muscle-specific PDZ protein. 2L.-H. Wang, H.-Y. Tang, and S. M. Strittmatter, manuscript in preparation. The four most variable inserts from the 15 clones were sequenced, the longest insert being 1.7 kb. All four of the sequences contain a polyadenylate tail and have 5′-ends within 150 bases of one another. A single extended open reading frame was identified and was in frame with the GAL4 transactivation domain. The interacting protein is designated SEMCAP-1. The SEMCAP-1 cDNA encodes an open reading frame of 333 amino acids. The longest clone has 27 base pairs of 5′-untranslated region, and the shortest clone is missing the first 40 amino acids from the conceptual sequence. A BLAST search of nucleic acid data bases using the predicted amino acid sequence identified a matching partial sequence derived from a human cDNA that interacts with the carboxyl-terminal portion of the transactivator (Tax) protein of human T cell leukemia virus type 1. Data base searches after this manuscript was in preparation revealed that SEMCAP-1 is identical to GIPC, a protein identified by virtue of its interaction with the RGS protein, GAIP (27De Vries L. Lou X. Zhao G. Zheng B. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12340-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The search identified two predicted open reading frames of Caenorhabditis elegansgenes, C35D10.2 and F44D12.6, with significant homology. We also found several overlapping clones of mouse expressed sequence tags whose sequences were highly homologous to SEMCAP-1(GIPC). From two of those expressed sequence tag clones (IMAGE consortium, AA266091 andAA107535), we obtained a 1.35-kb cDNA. The predicted 314-amino acid residue polypeptide interacts specifically with the cytoplasmic tail of M-SemF in yeast two-hybrid analysis (Fig. 2 A). Thus, this protein is designated SEMCAP-2. The amino acid sequences of SEMCAP-1(GIPC) and SEMCAP-2 share 62% identity, whereas those of C35D10.2 and F44D12.6 share 86% identity with one another and 52% similarity with SEMCAP-1(GIPC) (Fig.2 B). Homology is distributed throughout these four proteins, but the most variable region is the amino terminus, and the twoC. elegans gene products have extended carboxyl-terminal regions of about 20 amino acids. In addition, an internal segment of about 70 amino acids displays homology with sequences from a variety of proteins including CASK, PSD-95, syntrophin, and ZO-1. Further analysis reveals that this 70-amino acid segment aligns with the PDZ domains of those proteins. PDZ domains are known to interact with the cytoplasmic tail of transmembrane proteins and localize such proteins to sites of specialized cell-cell contacts such as PSD and zona occludens (34O'Brien R.J. Lau L.F. Huganir R.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 35Ponting C.P. Christopher P. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The interaction requires conserved amino acid residues at the carboxyl terminus of the transmembrane protein. We examined the sequence of M-SemF and found that the last four amino acid residues are Glu-Ser-Ser-Val, which agrees with the consensus sequence of the class I PDZ domain binding motif: X-(Ser/Thr)-X-Val (36Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). This suggests that the cytoplasmic tail of M-SemF may associate with cellular protein(s) through a PDZ domain. When the PDZ domains from the four predicted SEMCAP proteins were compared with those from PSD-95 and CASK, they displayed only 10–20% sequence identity. However, conservation is high for residues most critical in the formation of the carboxylate binding loop (hydrophobic residue-Gly-hydrophobic residue) and for the histidine residue in helix B (Fig. 2 C) (37Daniels D.L.

Consistent with the expression of G protein-coupled P2Y receptors in skeletal tissue, the human osteosarcoma cell line SaOS-2 and primary osteoblasts express P2Y1 and P2Y2 receptors, respectively. Their activation by nucleotide agonists (ADP and ATP for P2Y1; ATP and UTP for P2Y2) elevates [Ca2+]i and moderately induces expression of the c-fos proto-oncogene. A synergistic effect on c-fos induction is observed by combining ATP and parathyroid hormone, a key bone cell regulator. Parathyroid hormone elevates intracellular cAMP levels and correspondingly activates a stably integrated reporter gene driven by the Ca2+/cAMP-responsive element of the human c-fospromoter. Nucleotides have little effect on either cAMP levels or this reporter, instead activating luciferase controlled by the full c-fos promoter. This induction is reproduced by a stably integrated serum response element reporter independently of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and ternary complex factor phosphorylation. This novel example of synergy between the cAMP-dependent protein kinase/CaCRE signaling module and a non-mitogen-activated protein kinase/ternary complex factor pathway that targets the serum response element shows that extracellular ATP, via P2Y receptors, can potentiate strong responses to ubiquitous growth and differentiative factors.

Extracellular stimuli regulate gene expression via the activation of intracellular signaling systems that transduce the signal from membrane-bound receptors to transcription factors. This results in the rapid, transient induction of genes at the transcriptional level whose products will mediate the appropriate cellular response. One of the best characterized of these immediate early genes is the c-fos proto-oncogene, whose activation can be linked to different signaling cascades targeting distinct promoter elements through the phosphorylation of transcription factors (1Hill C.S.

Proteins of the CREB/activating transcription factor family recognize this element, and transcriptional induction arises via their phosphorylation on Ser133 (5Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). The serum response element (SRE), at position −300 in the promoter, mediates induction by many extracellular signals via a ternary complex composed of a dimer of serum response factor (SRF) together with one molecule of the TCF family of Ets proteins (Elk-1, SAP-1a, or ERP/NET/SAP-2 (6Herrera R.E.

TCFs, particularly Elk-1 and SAP-1a, are important nuclear targets of various MAPK cascades (11Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar), while SRF is apparently sufficient for activation by certain Ca2+ signals and signals emanating from the Rho/Rac/CDC42 family of small GTPases (12Misra R.P.

Upstream of the SRE is the v-sis-inducible element, the binding site for homo- and heterodimers of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and 3 upon their cytoplasmic activation by cytokines and certain growth factors (15Wagner B.J.

Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). While transient transfections have proven useful in attributing a role to each element, the results from mice containing c-fos transgenes (17Robertson L.M. Kerppola T.K. Vendrell M. Luk D. Smeyne R.J. Bocchiaro C. Morgan J.I. Curran T. Neuron. 1995; 14: 241-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and more recent data in vitro indicate that multiple elements are necessary for a strong response (18Bonni A.

Hipskind, manuscript in preparation; R. A. Hipskind, C. Halleux, S. Decker, M. Bebien, D. B. Evans, and G. Bilbe, manuscript in preparation. thereby implying that they are targeted simultaneously by intracellular signals. c-fos induction plays an important role in vitroin driving immortalized fibroblasts to enter the cell cycle and plays an important role in vivo in the skeletal system. Mice lacking the c-fos gene fail to develop osteoclasts and thus show an osteopetrotic phenotype in which the dynamic process of bone remodeling has been shifted toward bone accumulation (19Johnson R.S. Spiegelman B.M. Papaioannou V. Cell. 1992; 71: 577-586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 20Wang Z.-Q. Ovitt C. Grigoriadis A.E. Mohle-Steinlein U. Ruther U. Wagner E.F. Nature. 1992; 360: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Conversely, constitutive overexpression of c-fos in the bone environment of transgenic mice leads to the development of osteosarcomas (21Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3270) Google Scholar, 22Grigoriadis A.E. Wang Z.-Q. Cecchini M.G. Hofstetter W. Felix R. Fleish H.A. Wagner E.F. Science. 1994; 266: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a number of proteins characteristic of differentiating bone cells have regulatory activator protein 1 sites in their promoters, and a variety of extracellular factors documented to stimulate bone cell growth and differentiation activate c-fos transcription in cultured bone cells in vitro (2Hipskind R.A. Bilbe G. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 22Grigoriadis A.E. Wang Z.-Q. Cecchini M.G. Hofstetter W. Felix R. Fleish H.A. Wagner E.F.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is essential for the modeling and remodeling of the skeleton. In bone-derived cell lines as well as in primary osteoblasts in culture, PTH strongly induces transcription of the c-fos gene (23Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Montecino M. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 593-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 24Lee K. Deeds J.D. Chiba S. Un-No M. Bond A.T. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This occurs via the cAMP/cAMP-dependent protein kinase/CREB pathway in the osteosarcoma cell line SaOS-2 (25Evans D.B. Hipskind R.A. Bilbe G. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1066-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) but may involve protein kinase C and the ERK pathway in other cells (2Hipskind R.A. Bilbe G. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because PTH is a systemic factor and the process of bone remodeling is essentially a focal phenomenon, cellular responsiveness to PTH in vivo is likely to be modulated by other factors. We wondered whether ATP might play such a modulatory role, since ATP can be released from osteoblasts into the local bone microenvironment via a nonlytic mechanism (26Bowler W.B. Tattersall J.A. Hussein R. Dixon C.J. Cobbold P.H. Gallagher J.A. Bone. 1998; 22: 3SCrossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and since ATP synergizes with mitogens to enhance DNA synthesis in a variety of cells (27Huang N. Wang D. Heppel L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7904-7908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 28Wang D. Huang N. Heppel L.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 29Tornquist K. Ekokoski E. Dugue B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Extracellular nucleotides, such as ATP, exert stimulatory effects on cells at micromolar concentrations through the P2 family of membrane-bound receptors (30Dubyak G.R. Fedan J.S. Comp. Ther. 1990; 16: 57-61PubMed Google Scholar, 31Boarder M.R. Weisman G.A. Turner J.T. Wilkinson G.F. Trends Pharmacol.

Two major classes of P2 receptors have been delineated: P2X receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels, and P2Y receptors, which are coupled to G proteins (32Harden T.K. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 541-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More pertinent to our hypothesis, P2Y receptors are expressed in osteoblastic cells of rat (34Kumagai H. Sacktor B. Filburn C.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1991; 6: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 35Reimer W.J. Dixon S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C1040-C1048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and human origin (36Schofl C. Cuthbertson K.S. Walsh C.A. Mayne C. Cobbold P. Von Zur Muhlen A. Hesch R.D. Gallagher J.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 6: 697-708Google Scholar, 37Bowler W.B. Birch M.A. Gallagher J.A. Bilbe G. J. Bone. Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Two major subtypes of P2Y receptor, P2Y1 and P2Y2, are coupled through Gq to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis and hence Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores (32Harden T.K. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 541-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that both the osteosarcoma cell line SaOS-2 and primary cells in culture express P2Y receptors that functionally couple to c-fos activation. This involves increased intracellular Ca2+ and a signaling pathway that can activate an SRE-driven reporter gene independently of the predominant ERK/TCF signaling module. Co-activation of this pathway and that induced by PTH increases c-fos mRNA levels well above those induced by either stimulus alone, thereby providing a novel example of synergy between a cAMP-dependent protein kinase and a Ca2+-triggered signaling system not involving MAPK. These data demonstrate that extracellular nucleotides can strongly potentiate the response of bone cells to systemic factors and suggest that this may be a common mechanism to generate strong localized responses to systemic growth and differentiation factors. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, α-modified Eagle's medium, Ham's F-12, and RPMI 1640 were obtained from Flow Laboratories (United Kingdom).

Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was purchased from Millipore Corp. Human bone-derived cells (HBDC) were isolated and cultured from explants of human bone as described previously (38Gallagher J.A. Gundle R. Beresford J.N. Jones G.E. Methods in Molecular Medicine. I. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1996: 233-263Google Scholar). In brief, specimens of human bone in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were finely minced with a scalpel and then washed free of marrow cells with several volumes of medium. The minced bone was cultured in 9-cm Petri dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mml-glutamine. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 for 3 weeks. Confluent cells were either seeded onto glass coverslips or induced for subsequent preparation of whole cell extracts or RNA. SaOS-2 cells were maintained in α-modified Eagle's medium supplemented as above, and seeded onto glass coverslips or harvested upon confluence. The fragment containing the c-fospromoter (spanning positions −721 to −1, accession number M16287) linked to the luciferase gene was subcloned from pUC19fosluc1 (kindly provided by Dr. L. Runkel) into pSV2neo, to create pfoslucneo1. A multimerized SRE-luciferase reporter gene vector was obtained by ligating the oligonucleotide CCGCAGGATGTCCATATTAGGACATCTGTGTGCCGTCCTACAGGTATAATCCTGTAGACACGCCGG that was used to replace the promoter upstream of the c-fos TATA box in the same vector. Clones containing three copies of the SRE were identified and verified by sequencing. The vector containing a single copy of the c-fos CaCRE was generated by deleting sequences upstream of position −88 in thefos promoter in pfoslucneo1. Its identity was verified by sequencing. SaOS-2 cells (ATCC HTB 85) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS. These cells were transfected with pfoslucneo1 or CaCRE-luc using Lipofectin reagent according to the protocols of the manufacturer, and the cells were maintained in RPMI/FCS for 24 h. Stably transfected cell pools were selected for resistance to G418 following standard protocols (39Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). UMR-106 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) supplemented with 10% FCS at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Stable pools of UMR-106 cells containing the SRE-luciferase reporter were generated as described above. For reporter gene assays, the cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 96,000 cells/well. At near confluence, the medium was replaced with one containing 0.5% FCS for 16 h, followed by serum-free RPMI containing 0.1% BSA for 24 h. Agonists were added to cells as a 10× stock solution prepared in the same medium to the final concentrations indicated in the figures. After a 4-h incubation, cells were washed twice in cold PBS and lysed in luciferase cell culture lysis reagent for 15 min at room temperature (25 μl/96-well plate). The plates were subsequently centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature before transferring 20 μl of each sample to a 96-well microtiter plate (Dynatech) for analysis. A microtiter plate luminometer (ML 3000, Dynatech Laboratories) was set up in the enhanced flash mode (maximum sensitivity, delay time = 2 s, integration time = 10 s). Luciferase reagent (100 μl) was automatically added, and light emission was measured every 10 ms during a period of 10 s. Data were recorded as the peak value of relative light units. SaOS-2 cells and HBDC were grown to confluence on 22-mm diameter glass coverslips. [Ca2+]i was measured after 2 h of serum deprivation. Cells were loaded with fura-2 by incubation with fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (5 mm) for 20 min at 37 °C in HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, 121 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mmCaCl2, 5 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.2) containing 2% BSA. Cells were subsequently washed three times in the same buffer containing 0.2% BSA. Measurements were performed with a photon-counting spectrophotometer on a Nikon TM Diaphot microscope with a × 40 oil immersion objective. The cell-coated coverslip was attached with silicone grease to form the base of a stage-mounted, thermostatically regulated chamber maintained at 37 °C. Groups of 6–8 cells were illuminated with excitation light (340 and 380 nm) at a rate of 32 times/s, and the emission measurements (at 510 nm) were integrated into 1-s averages and stored. Agonists, in HEPES buffer with 0.2% BSA, were added for 60–120 s, followed by at least 10 min of recovery prior to further stimulation. R min,R max, and autofluorescence values were obtainedin situ using ionomycin, as described previously (40Thomas A.P. Delaville F. McCormack J.G. Cobbold P.H. Techniques in Calcium Research. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 1-54Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i was calculated from the ratio of fluorescence at the two excitation wavelengths after subtraction of autofluorescence (41Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The results were evaluated statistically using the Student's t test, assuming a significance ofp < 0.05. Total RNA was extracted from control and stimulated cells with 4 mguanidine thiocyanate, 0.5% sarkosyl, 0.1 mmercaptoethanol, 25 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, followed by acid phenol/chloroform extraction (39Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). RNA was stored in ethanol at −20 °C. Prior to first strand cDNA synthesis, RNA was DNase-treated with RNase-free DNase I (35 units/ml). 5 μg of DNase-treated total RNA was used as template for first strand cDNA synthesis in a 50-μl reaction containing 0.5 mm dNTPs, 1.25 μg of oligo(dT), 20 units of RNase inhibitor, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 6 mm MgCl2, 40 mmKCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 1000 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. After 1 h at 37 °C, the reaction was frozen at −20 °C. 5–10 μg of total RNA was denatured and electrophoresed through a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel containing 3.7% formaldehyde (v/v), followed by transfer to Zetabind hybridization membrane as described by Evans et al.

Blots were prehybridized at 42 °C in 40% formamide, 5× SSC, 10× Denhardt's reagent, 1% SDS, 200 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 200 μg of tRNA and probed with a 487-base pair fragment spanning exons 3 and 4 of the human c-fos gene labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) by random priming. Membranes were washed for 30 min at 65 °C with 0.2× SSC, 1% SDS solution, and mRNAs were visualized using phosphor storage technology and autoradiography with Kodak XAR film and intensifying screens at −70 °C. RNA loading and integrity were followed by ethidium bromide staining or hybridization with a random primed fragment purified from a cDNA clone containing rat GAPDH. The blot in Fig. 6 was hybridized with c-fos and GAPDH riboprobes in the same mix as described previously (42Hipskind R.A. Baccarini M. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6219-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). 50-μl PCRs contained 0.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase, 1 μg of sense and antisense primers (see below), 200 μm dNTPs, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm mercaptoethanol, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 2 μl of cDNA. P2Y1, P2Y2, and GAPDH were amplified for 40 cycles (94 °C for 10 s; 58 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 30 s). The primer sequences were as follows: P2Y1 sense, TGTGGTGTACCCCCTCAAGTCCC; P2Y1 antisense, ATCCGTAACAGCCCAGAATCAGCA; P2Y2 sense, CCAGGCCCCCGTGCTCTACTTTG; P2Y2 antisense, CATGTTGATGGCGTTGAGGGTGTG; GAPDH sense, GGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGG; GAPDH antisense, GGTCATGAGTCCTTCCACGAT. SaOS-2 cells were serum-starved as above and then pretreated with 0.1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine for 30 min at 37 °C. Agonist was then added as described in the legend to Fig. 7. After a 20-min incubation, the cells were covered with 1 ml of ice-cold 65% ethanol and scraped off with a rubber policeman. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 8000 ×g for 3 min and stored at −20 °C until cAMP levels were determined using a radioimmunoassay (43O'Reilly D.S,. Fraser W.D. Penney M.D. Logue F.C. Cowan R.A. Williams B.C. Walters G. J. Endocrinol. 1986; 111: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The statistical significance was assessed by a one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons post-test. Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (42Hipskind R.A. Baccarini M. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6219-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). At the appropriate time point, plates were placed on ice, and the cell layer was quickly washed twice with ice-cold PBS (140 mm NaCl, 10 mmNaPO4, pH 7.3) containing 10 mm NaF and 100 μm Na3VO4. Cells were solubilized in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.05; 50 mm NaCl; 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate; 50 mm NaF; 5 mm ZnCl2; 1% (v/v) Triton X-100; 100 μm Na3VO4; 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate; 10 mm 4-nitrophenyl phosphate; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 0.5 mm benzamidine; 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin; 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and 200 nm okadaic acid. The cell layer was collected by scraping, and lysis was completed by vortexing for 45 s. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, and the supernatant was stored at −70 °C. Reactions (7.5 μl) contained the following components: 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)(dI-dC), 250 ng of calf thymus DNA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 66 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.35% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.05% (w/v) low fat milk, 15 mmdithiothreitol, 15,000 cpm of 32P-labeled probe (0.2 ng/4 fmol), and 10 μg of whole cell extract. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the entire reaction was loaded on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 45 mm Tris borate, 1.5 mm EDTA (pH 8.3) and run at 1 mA/cm for 3–4 h. Gels were dried, and the complexes were visualized by autoradiography using intensifying screens or phosphor storage technology. Core SRF90–244 was produced in HeLa cells using a recombinant vaccinia virus (8Hipskind R.A. Rao V.N. Mueller C.G.F. Reddy E.S.P. Nordheim A. Nature. 1991; 354: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The probe corresponded to the c-fos SRE (see above) subcloned in front of a G-free cassette plasmid (44Hipskind R.A. Nordheim A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19583-19592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AfterEcoRI and NarI digestion, the ends were labeled by a Klenow fill-in reaction containing [α-32P]dATP and cold dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP. Fragments were isolated from polyacrylamide gels by electroelution. 15 μg of whole cell extracts were separated on an 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis minigel and transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride. The filter was blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% (w/v) BSA in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C with the specific antiserum indicated below in blocking buffer. After washing in TBST, the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse antibody, diluted 1:1000 in 5% (w/v) low fat milk powder-TBST. After washing, the immune complexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence. The antisera used were anti-pan-ERK, diluted 1:5000; anti-phospho-Thr202/Tyr204 ERK, anti-phospho Thr183/Tyr185 SAPK, anti-phospho Thr180/Tyr182 p38, anti-SAPK, and anti-p38, diluted 1:1000. Since osteoblasts have been described to express different purinergic receptors of the P2Y family, we used RT-PCR to analyze which subtypes are expressed in the human osteosarcoma cell line SaOS-2. In addition, we tested two populations of primary osteoblastic cells derived from explants of human bone in vitro culture, termed HBDC1 and HBDC2. RT-PCR on cDNA from SaOS-2 cells gave rise to an intense signal for P2Y1 receptor transcripts but only a weak signal for P2Y2 receptor (Fig. 1). In contrast, only P2Y2 receptor transcripts were visualized in the HBDC1 cDNA, while amplification of HBDC2-derived cDNA showed similar levels of amplification for both P2Y1 and P2Y2. The signal with primers specific for GAPDH was similar in all reactions (Fig. 1), confirming the integrity and amount of cDNA in each sample. P2Y receptors are coupled to heteromeric G proteins intracellularly, and have been reported to activate, via Gq, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis and Ca2+mobilization from intracellular stores (32Harden T.K. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 541-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since SaOS-2 cells and HBDC1 express predominantly the P2Y1 and P2Y2receptors, respectively, we tested whether different P2Y1and P2Y2 receptor agonists could mobilize intracellular Ca2+, measured using fluorescence increases in groups of 6–8 fura-2-loaded cells. ATP consistently induced a rise in [Ca2+]i in both cell types (Fig.2 A and TableI). In SaOS-2 cells, ATP was effective at concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 μm (Fig.2 A). In these cells, the P2Y2 agonist UTP evoked only a minor increase in [Ca2+]i at 10 μm and a more significant increase at 100 μm (Fig. 2 B) that nevertheless was smaller than that induced by 1 μm ATP (Fig. 2, compareA and B). This difference in responsiveness was also observed upon the"

Previously, we found that calpains were equally translocated to cellular membranes (a prerequisite for protease activation) in the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. However, activation, as judged by degradation of fodrin, occurred only in the ipsilateral hemisphere. In this study we demonstrate that calpastatin, the specific, endogenous inhibitor protein to calpain, is up-regulated in response to hypoxia and may be responsible for the halted calpain activation in the contralateral hemisphere. Concomitantly, extensive degradation of calpastatin occurred in the ipsilateral hemisphere, as demonstrated by the appearance of a membrane-bound 50-kDa calpastatin breakdown product. The calpastatin breakdown product accumulated in the synaptosomal fraction, displaying a peak 24 h post-insult, but was not detectable in the cytosolic fraction. The degradation of calpastatin was blocked by administration of CX295, a calpain inhibitor, indicating that calpastatin acts as a suicide substrate to calpain during hypoxia-ischemia. In summary, calpastatin was up-regulated in areas that remain undamaged and degraded in areas where excessive activation of calpains and infarction occurs.

Andiné P. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1994; 77: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) followed by a secondary phase of cellular calcium overload simultaneous with or slightly preceding development of hypoxic-ischemic neuronal damage (5Stein D.

Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1989; 9: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Calpains (EC 3.4.22.17) are calcium-activated, nonlysosomal, neutral cysteine proteases proposed to participate in many important intracellular processes, such as turnover of cytoskeletal proteins and regulation of kinase activity and transcription factors (8Saido T. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 9Croall D. DeMartino G. Physiol Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). The activity of calpains is strictly regulated by calcium concentrations and interaction with calpastatin (the endogenous inhibitor protein), membrane phospholipids, and a multitude of other factors. The ubiquitous distribution of calpains and the complex regulation of their activity indicate that these proteases play important roles under both physiological and pathological conditions.

Inhibition of calpains may be particularly effective in the perinatal setting, considering the high calpain content in the rapidly growing brain (23Blomgren K. Karlsson J. Neurochem. Res. 1989; 14: 1149-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and increased calpain activity following hypoxia-ischemia (24Ostwald K. Hagberg H. Andiné P. Karlsson J. Brain Res. 1993; 630: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, calpain activation, as judged by the accumulation of FBDP, was especially prominent in the white matter (18Blomgren K. McRae A. Bona E. Saido T. Karlsson J. Hagberg H. Brain Res. 1995; 684: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which is interesting in the light of the specific vulnerability of the white matter in the immature brain and its devastating clinical consequences (periventricular leukomalacia). It is generally considered that upon stimulation calpains are translocated to cellular membranes, where they bind to potential substrates. The interaction between calpains, substrates (25Inomata M. Hayashi M. Nakamura M. Saito Y. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18838-18843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cellular components such as acidic phospholipids (26Saido T. Mizuno K. Suzuki K. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 485-489PubMed Google Scholar) and DNA (27Mellgren R. Song K. Mericle M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 653-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), drastically increase the calcium sensitivity of the proteases, lowering the calcium concentration required for activation down to physiological or near physiological levels. Calpastatin, the endogenous inhibitor protein of calpains, has also been demonstrated to bind to membranes, even purified phospholipid vesicles (28Mellgren R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Hence, the subcellular distribution of calpains and calpastatin is crucial for the functions of these proteins. The interaction between calpains and calpastatin is reversible and calcium-dependent in the sense that calpains bind to the inhibitor only after binding calcium (29DeMartino G. Croall D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 232: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The inhibitory activity seems to be specific for calpains, because no other protease tested so far is affected by calpastatin. Interestingly, it has been shown that calpastatin can be easily degraded by calpains in vitro (30Mellgren R. Mericle M. Lane R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 246: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 31Nakamura M. Inomata M. Imajoh S. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and in cultured cells (32Nagao S. Saido T. Akita Y. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J Biochem (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). No conclusive evidence of calpain-induced cleavage of calpastatin in vivo has been presented so far. Using a modified Levine preparation (33Rice J. Vannucci R. Brierley J. Ann. Neurol. 1981; 9: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar, 34Hagberg H. Gilland E. Diemer N. Andine P. Biol. Neonate. 1994; 66: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) allowed us to study the effects of both hypoxia and hypoxia-ischemia (HI) on the immature brain in the same animal. Previously we found that calpain was translocated to membranes, a prerequisite for activation, to the same extent in both hemispheres, but activation, as indicated by increased fodrin proteolysis, occurred only in the ipsilateral, damaged hemisphere (17Blomgren K. Kawashima S. Saido T. Karlsson J. Elmered A. Hagberg H. Brain Res. 1995; 684: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Blomgren K. McRae A. Bona E. Saido T. Karlsson J. Hagberg H. Brain Res. 1995; 684: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The present work was undertaken to elucidate whether calpastatin is involved in the process of halting calpain activation in the contralateral, undamaged hemisphere. Unilateral HI was induced in 7-day-old Wistar F rats of both sexes (33Rice J. Vannucci R. Brierley J. Ann. Neurol. 1981; 9: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar, 34Hagberg H. Gilland E. Diemer N. Andine P. Biol. Neonate. 1994; 66: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The pups were anesthetized with halothane (3.0% for induction and 1.0–1.5% for maintenance) in a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen (1:1), and the duration of anesthesia was <10 min. The left common carotid artery was cut between double ligatures of prolene sutures (6–0). After the surgical procedure the wounds were infiltrated with a local anesthetic, and the pups were allowed to recover for 1–2 h. The litters were then placed in a chamber perfused with a humidified gas mixture (7.70 ± 0.01% oxygen in nitrogen) for 100 min. The temperature in the gas chamber was kept at 36 °C. After hypoxic exposure the pups were returned to their biological dams until sacrificed. Control animals were operated and ligated but not subjected to hypoxia. All animal experimentation was approved by the Ethical Committee of Göteborg (numbers 162-95 and 225-97). Two litters (n = 17) were treated with the calpain inhibitor CX295 (Z-leu-aminobutyric acid-CONH(CH2)3-morpholine). The first dose, 200 μl of 5 mm CX295 in 100 mm NaCl (equivalent to approximately 80 μmol/kg or 40 mg/kg body weight), was administered immediately after HI. Subsequently, animals were injected with 100 μl of the CX295 solution (equivalent to approximately 40 μmol/kg or 20 mg/kg body weight) every 3 h for 24 h. Each litter was divided into two groups, where one group received subcutaneous injections and the other received intraperitoneal injections. Control animals were injected with 100 mmNaCl. The animals were sacrificed by decapitation, and the brains were rapidly dissected out on a bed of ice, weighed, quickly frozen in isopenthane and dry ice, and stored at −80 °C. Cortical tissue rostral to the hippocampus (approximately 50 mg) was dissected out from each hemisphere at −10 °C. The tissue was homogenized by sonication in 10 volumes of ice-cold 50 mm sodium borate (pH 8.0) containing 320 mm sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 3 mm NaN3. Homogenate samples were mixed with an equal volume of concentrated (3×) SDS-PAGE buffer and heated (96 °C) for 5 min. Subcellular fractionation was carried out essentially according to Hu and Wieloch (35Hu B. Wieloch T. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and Cotman et al. (36Cotman C. Banker G. Churchill L. Taylor D. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 63: 441-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The remaining homogenate was centrifuged at 800 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation of the supernatant at 9,200 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet (P2), representing a crude synaptosomal fraction, was washed by resuspending it in 500 μl of homogenizing buffer and centrifuging again at 9,200 × g. The washed pellet was resuspended in 250 μl of 3 × SDS-PAGE buffer, heated (96 °C) for 5 min, and stored at −80 °C. The supernatant (S2) was further separated into a particulate membrane fraction (P3) and a cytosolic fraction (S3) by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The S3 was decanted, added to an equal volume of 3 × SDS-PAGE buffer, heated (96 °C) for 5 min, and stored at −80 °C. The calpastatin antibody was raised against a synthetic 16-mer peptide corresponding to the C-terminal portion of rat calpastatin (37Eto A. Akita Y. Saido T. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25115-25120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). An antibody that specifically recognizes the N-terminal, calpain-specific proteolytic 147-kDa breakdown product (BDPN) of rat α-fodrin (38Bahr B. Tiriveedhi S. Park G. Lynch G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 273: 902-908PubMed Google Scholar) was used to detect fodrin cleavage. The calpain antibody (1D10A7) recognizes the large subunit of both m- and μ-calpain (39Kasai Y. Inomata M. Hayashi M. Imahori K. Kawashima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), with an approximately seven times higher affinity for m-calpain (17Blomgren K. Kawashima S. Saido T. Karlsson J. Elmered A. Hagberg H. Brain Res. 1995; 684: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase- or biotin-conjugated, were from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). The protein concentration of homogenates, P2, and S3 fractions in SDS-PAGE buffer was determined according to Karlsson et al. (40Karlsson J. Ostwald K. Kåbjörn C. Andersson M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 144-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Samples corresponding to 20 μg of total protein were electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels or NOVEX precast 8–16% Tris-glycine gels (NOVEX, San Diego, CA) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Hybond-P, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or nitrocellulose (0.45 μm; Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) membranes. Immunoreactive species were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, Super Signal, or Super Signal ULTRA chemiluminescent substrates (Pierce) and Fuji RX film (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). Films were scanned, and immunoreactive bands were quantified using the software IPLab Gel 1.5f (Scanalytics Corp., Fairfax, VA). Every sample was analyzed 1–8 times, and when multiple determinations were performed the average value was used asn = 1. Pups were re-anesthetized and perfusion-fixed with Histofix (isotonic, buffered 5% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.2) from Histolab, Västra Frölunda, Sweden). Following dissection and 2 h post-fixation at 4 °C, the brains were equilibrated in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl (phosphate-buffered saline) and 20% sucrose and 0.02% NaN3 overnight at 4 °C and embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound (Sakura Finetek Europe, Zoeterwoude, Netherlands). Coronal frozen sections (10 μm) were mounted and boiled in 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 min (antigen recovery) and blocked in 4% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. The sections were incubated with the calpastatin antibody (1:100 in blocking solution) and the secondary, biotin-labeled antibody (1:250) for 1 h each at room temperature. Visualization was performed using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). After decapitation, the brains were rapidly removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from each hemisphere using the guanidine isothiocyanate-cesium chloride method (41Chirgwin J. Przybyla A. MacDonald R. Rutter W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar), quantified spectrophotometrically at 260 nm, and stored at −80 °C. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed with the Superscript RNase H− Reverse Transcriptase kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) and random hexamer primers (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Total RNA (2 μg), random primers (500 ng), and RNase-free water to 24 μl was incubated at 70 °C for 10 min. The mixture was chilled on ice and 8 μl of 5× First Strand Buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 375 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2), 4 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 2 μl each of 10 mmdATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min followed by 2 min at 42 °C. RT enzyme (2 μl or 400 units) was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 60 min at 42 °C, followed by 15 min of inactivation at 70 °C. The cDNA was diluted to 100 μl with water and stored at −20 °C. Each PCR (25 μl) contained 4 μl of template cDNA, 0.2 mm each dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 μm of each primer, 1 unit ofTaq DNA Polymerase (Sigma) and 2.5 μl 10× PCR Buffer (Sigma). PCR cycling included: step 1, 94 °C for 5 min; step 2, 8 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 62 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 20 s; step 3, the tubes were placed on ice, and the internal standard (GAPDH) primers were added (2 μl), 1 μm final concentration; step 4, 18 more cycles as in step 2; step 5, 72 °C for 5 min. The primers used were: calpastatin upstream, 5′(1576)-ATG GGA AGG ACA AAC CAG AGA AGC C-3′, and downstream, 5′(1870)-TGA TCT TCA AAA GTC ACC ATC CAC C-3′ primers; GAPDH upstream, 5′(229)-ACC ACC ATG GAG AAG GCT GC-3′, and downstream, 5′(812)-CTC AGT GTA GCC CAG GAT GC-3′ primers. All primers were from Kebo Lab (Stockholm, Sweden). The annealing temperature and cycle numbers were chosen such that both the calpastatin and the GAPDH PCR products would be in the linear phase of amplification and of similar intensity (data not shown). The PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed under UV light. The pictures were scanned, and the bands were quantified using the software IPLab Gel 1.5f (Scanalytics Corp., Fairfax, VA). Oligonucleotide (25-mer) primers were produced using a synthesizer from Applied Biosystems. The primer sequences were: 5′-CTG GAC CTT GAA CGT ACG GGA ACA T-3′ (upstream) and 5′-CTG GAT TCT TTA GAC GCT CCA CAC A-3′ (downstream). Primers were designed to amplify a 441-base pair sequence from the noncoding region of the rat m-calpain gene, bases 2281–2719 (42DeLuca C. Davies P. Samis J. Elce J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The PCR product was sequenced to verify its identity. The m-calpain DNA transcript was cloned into a pCR-Script Tm SK(+) plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and linearized with NotI, and a riboprobe was synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase and digoxigenin-labeled UTP using digoxigenin RNA Labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). As an internal control, a 30-mer oligonucleotide probe complementary to bases 1851–1880 of rat 18 S rRNA (42DeLuca C. Davies P. Samis J. Elce J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (5′-ATC CTT CCG CAG GTT CAC CTA CGG AAA CCT-3′) was used. The probe was labeled using digoxigenin Oligonucleotide Tailing kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Animals were sacrificed by decapitation, and the brains were rapidly removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from each hemisphere by the guanidine isothiocyanate-cesium chloride method (41Chirgwin J. Przybyla A. MacDonald R. Rutter W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis and capillary blotting, membranes were hybridized with the m-calpain probe, stripped, and rehybridized with the 18 S rRNA probe. Digoxigenin-labeled species were visualized using chemiluminescence (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and quantified using the software IPLab Gel 1.5f (Scanalytics Corp., Fairfax, VA). The Mann-Whitney U test was used throughout, because normal distribution of the data could not be assumed. Where multiple comparisons were made with a control group, Bonferroni correction was used to compensate for this. The antibody against calpastatin displayed a distinct double band with an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa (Fig. 1). The antibody was highly specific, because no background or nonspecific bands were produced, just like in earlier studies (32Nagao S. Saido T. Akita Y. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J Biochem (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 37Eto A. Akita Y. Saido T. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15253-15257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the P2 fraction, a 50-kDa band appeared in the ipsilateral but not in the contralateral hemispheres after 1 h of recovery, reached a maximum after 24 h, and was no longer detectable 14 days after the insult (Fig. 1). This calpastatin breakdown product (CBDP) was very prominent and always appeared parallel to a decrease of the intact, 110-kDa band. The 50-kDa CBDP was prominent also in homogenates but could not be detected in the cytosolic fractions (Fig. 1). After 1 and 2 days of recovery, the sum of the densitometric values of the 110- and 50-kDa bands in the ipsilateral hemispheres was larger than the amount of calpastatin immunoreactivity in the contralateral hemispheres, particularly in the P2 fractions (Fig.1). In the major, cytosolic pool of calpastatin, an up-regulation was demonstrated in the contralateral, hypoxic hemisphere (Figs. 1 and 2). The increase was evident already at the end of hypoxic exposure and more prominent after 2–24 h of recovery (171% after 2 h,p = 0.014 and 185%, p = 0.007, respectively, after Bonferroni correction). No significant increase could be detected in the ipsilateral hemispheres. Rather, the contralateral hemispheres displayed 39% (0 h), 112% (2 h), 103% (6 h), 57% (1 days), and 119% (2 days) higher values than the corresponding ipsilateral hemispheres (p = 0.013, 0.037, 0.0007, 0.016, and 0.010, respectively) (Fig. 2). Only intact calpastatin (110 kDa) could be detected in the S3fraction. In tissue sections, the changes in calpastatin immunoreactivity in the parietal cortex followed those demonstrated by Western blotting, i.e. an increase in the contralateral and a decrease in the ipsilateral hemisphere (Fig.3, panels 1–3). After 2 h of recovery, the number of immunoreactive cells had increased in the contralateral hemisphere compared with controls (Fig. 3,panels 1B and 2B). After 24 h of recovery there was a striking loss of immunoreactive cells in the ipsilateral hemisphere (Fig. 3, panels 1A,2A, and 3A). The multiplex RT-PCR produced a 320-base pair calpastatin fragment and a 600-base pair GAPDH fragment with similar staining intensities (not shown). The calpastatin mRNA, from the entire hemisphere, did not display any significant differences in the control animals during normal development (PND 7, 9, 13, and 21). During reperfusion calpastatin mRNA was quantified at 2 h and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 14 days of recovery (n = 6 at all time points, except PND 9 (control) and 14 days of recovery, wheren = 5). There was a tendency toward up-regulation after HI in both hemispheres, which turned out statistically significant in the ipsilateral hemispheres after 2 h and 6 days of recovery (146%, p = 0.0065 and 150%, p = 0.0039, respectively) and in the contralateral hemispheres after 14 days (204%, p = 0.0446) (not shown). However, considering the inherent limitations of the RT-PCR technique, interpretations should be made with caution because the increases observed were only 2-fold or less. The calpain levels were assayed in pooled samples only; therefore no statistical analyses could be performed. The purpose was to correlate calpain and calpastatin changes, temporally, in identical samples (on the same membranes) and to compare with our earlier findings. The 1D10A7 antibody produced a single, distinct band with an approximate molecular mass of 75 kDa, as previously described (17Blomgren K. Kawashima S. Saido T. Karlsson J. Elmered A. Hagberg H. Brain Res. 1995; 684: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The calpain immunoreactivity (per μg total protein) in the P2 fractions was approximately 10% of that in the S3 fractions (data not shown). This ratio is lower than for the membrane and microsomal fraction used previously (corresponding to the P3 fraction), where the immunoreactivity was 20% of that found in the S3 fractions (17Blomgren K. Kawashima S. Saido T. Karlsson J. Elmered A. Hagberg H. Brain Res. 1995; 684: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Immediately after HI the calpain levels were up-regulated in the S3 fractions (213 and 151% in the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, respectively), dropping to control levels or below after 2–48 h and increasing again in the ipsilateral hemisphere at 14 days post-HI (146% compared with controls at PND 21) (Fig. 4 a). The main change in the P2 fractions was a drastic decrease at 24 and 48 h post-HI to 5 and 6% in the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, respectively, after 24 h (Fig.4 b). In the control animals there was a down-regulation of calpain in the P2 fractions at PND 10 and PND 21, whereas the S3 fractions displayed an up-regulation at these time points, indicating that the normal development entails a decreased membrane/cytosolic ratio (Fig. 4). The m-calpain probe distinctly recognized a single band on Northern blots, with an apparent size of 3.5 kilobases (Fig. 5 a). There was substantial interindividual variation in the level of m-calpain mRNA, even after normalization to 18 S rRNA. The ratio between the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres in each animal, however, proved to be highly reproducible. In control animals this ratio remained close to 100% at all time points, whereas in animals exposed to hypoxia the ratio increased after the insult, being 167% after 48 h (p = 0.006) (Fig. 5 b). Animals treated with CX295 every 3 h for 24 h following the insult displayed significantly less degradation of intact calpastatin in the ipsilateral hemisphere (47% less degradation, p = 0.003) (Table I).

Cells can undergo apoptosis in response to a broad spectrum of stimuli, including receptor stimulation, treatment with cytotoxic drugs, and γ-radiation. Although a given stimulus may activate unique signaling molecules, the current model states that the molecular events in the execution phase of apoptotic cell death are shared. Members of the caspase family, which are aspartate-specific cysteine proteases, are key initiators of this execution phase (1Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillnacourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

Their proteolytic action on specific cellular components, including other caspases, structural proteins, and enzymes, leads to the ordered degradation of the cell into apoptotic bodies.Certain members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, including CD95, directly couple to the caspase cascade via their cytoplasmic death domain. Upon multimerization by its trimeric ligand, CD95 recruits the FADD adaptor via its death domain (3Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M.

Recently, several viral proteins, termed v-FLIP (FLICE inhibitory protein), were identified that contain two regions of homology to the DEDs of FADD and caspase-8 (6Thome M. Schneider P. Hofmann K.

Both viral and cellular FLIP proteins bind to FADD and/or caspase-8 and inhibit death receptor-induced apoptosis, most likely by displacing DED-containing caspases (caspase-8 and/or -10) from the activated death receptor complex (8Hu S.

In certain cases, the stimulus indirectly activates death receptors. An example is the T cell antigen receptor, which induces synthesis of CD95 ligand and therewith activates CD95 in, for example, Jurkat T cells (12Dhein J. Walczak H. Baumler C. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H Nature. 1995; 373: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism has been proposed for apoptosis induction by anticancer drugs (13Friesen C. Herr I.

Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), indicating a mechanism for regulation of the mitochondrial caspase pathway. It has also been shown that anticancer drugs can induce expression of CD95 and/or its ligand and therewith activate the CD95 pathway (13Friesen C. Herr I. Krammer P.H. Debatin K.-M. Nat.

However, this is not a general mechanism since etoposide-induced apoptosis is CD95-independent in murine thymocytes and Jurkat cells (32Boesen-de Cock J.G.R. de Vries E. Williams G.T. Borst J. Apoptosis. 1998; 3: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Several studies suggest that the lipid ceramide is relevant for apoptosis signaling in response to death receptors, γ-radiation, and anticancer drugs.

Moreover, failure to generate ceramide has been associated with apoptosis resistance (34Cifone M.G. Roncaioli P. De Maria R. Camarda G. Santoni A. Ruberti G. Testi R.

Exogenous short-chain ceramide can induce apoptosis in certain cell types, but it is not clear whether it is equivalent in its action to naturally generated ceramide. The ceramide response induced by CD95 lies upstream from DEVD-inhibitable caspases and nuclear segmentation (42Tepper A.D. Boesen-de Cock J.G.R. de Vries E. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24308-24312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), allowing for the possibility that ceramide contributes to generation of the apoptotic phenotype.Jurkat cells selected for resistance to CD95-induced apoptosis were found to be cross-resistant to etoposide and γ-radiation. Therefore, we have examined possible convergence of the apoptosis signaling pathways induced by these three stimuli. We find that the pathways share features downstream from DED-containing caspases and are subject to common mitochondrial control. In addition, comparing responses in Bcl-2 transfectants and the variant clones, we find evidence for a Bcl-2-independent mechanism that commonly regulates apoptosis signaling induced by CD95 and the DNA-damaging regimens.DISCUSSIONOur finding that cells selected for resistance to CD95-induced apoptosis were cross-resistant to apoptosis induction by etoposide and IR suggested that apoptosis signaling induced by these three stimuli has a common aspect. Since CD95 signaling involves FADD-mediated recruitment of caspase-8 and its subsequent proteolytic activation, we examined whether etoposide and IR also induced caspase-8 processing. Caspase-8 was cleaved to a minor extent in etoposide-treated and irradiated cells, but this proved to be dispensable for effector caspase processing and the cell death response. This is an important finding since it was suggested previously that anticancer drugs (13Friesen C. Herr I. Krammer P.H. Debatin K.-M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar,14Müller M. Strand S. Hug H. Heinemann E.-M. Walczak H. Hofmann W.J. Stremmel W. Krammer P.H. Galle P.R. J. Clin.

A. 1997; 94: 5750-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) can induce apoptosis by activating the CD95 receptor system. Anticancer drugs would do so by inducing synthesis of CD95 ligand (13Friesen C. Herr I. Krammer P.H. Debatin K.-M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 14Müller M. Strand S. Hug H. Heinemann E.-M. Walczak H. Hofmann W.J. Stremmel W. Krammer P.H. Galle P.R. J. Clin.

Krammer P.H. Galle P.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). CD95 was implicated in apoptosis induction by γ-radiation based on diminished radiation sensitivity of CD95-deficient splenocytes fromlpr mice (51Reap E.A. Roof K. Maynor K. Borrero M. Booker J. Cohen P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5750-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).Such a mechanism would obviously account for the observed cross-resistance. However, involvement of the CD95 receptor-ligand system in anticancer drug- and γ-radiation-induced apoptosis has been contradicted by several reports (32Boesen-de Cock J.G.R. de Vries E. Williams G.T. Borst J. Apoptosis. 1998; 3: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 52Smith G.C. Strasser A. Vaux D.L.

Blood. 1997; 90: 935-943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, in Jurkat cells, we could not detect CD95 ligand synthesis in response to etoposide or doxorubicin, and drug-induced apoptosis could not be inhibited by blocking interaction of CD95 with its ligand (32Boesen-de Cock J.G.R. de Vries E. Williams G.T. Borst J. Apoptosis. 1998; 3: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, CD95-deficient lpr thymocytes are sensitive to etoposide-induced (32Boesen-de Cock J.G.R. de Vries E. Williams G.T. Borst J. Apoptosis. 1998; 3: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and γ-radiation-induced (52Smith G.C. Strasser A. Vaux D.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5167-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) apoptosis to the same degree as wild-type cells. Based on our experiments using FLIPL-overexpressing cells, we can exclude a role for caspase-8 and therefore for CD95 in apoptosis signaling induced by etoposide and γ-radiation in Jurkat cells, in contrast to an earlier suggestion (55Herr I. Wilhelm D. Bohler T. Angel P. Debatin K.-M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6200-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Moreover, since FLIPL also inhibits TRAIL receptor-induced apoptosis (9Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.-L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar), these death receptors can also be excluded from playing a role in the DNA damage pathways in the cell type examined here.Caspase-8 cleavage induced by etoposide and γ-radiation was inhibited by Bcl-2 overexpression, suggesting a dependence on mitochondrial components such as cytochrome c. Most likely, caspase-8 is processed as a result of the activation of other caspases that are instrumental in etoposide- and radiation-induced apoptosis. Caspase-9 would be a good candidate to initiate the apoptosis signaling pathway induced by etoposide and γ-radiation since it can take part in the Apaf-1 complex (21Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar). However, available antibodies against caspase-9 did not allow detection of this enzyme in Jurkat cells (data not shown).Our study suggests that, in Jurkat cells, apoptosis signaling induced by etoposide and γ-radiation converges with a CD95-induced pathway downstream from caspase-8, at or upstream from the mitochondrion-dependent caspase complex. It has been debated whether the CD95 pathway can be regulated by the mitochondria as assessed by effects of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Bax overexpression in transgenic or transfected cells (25Strasser A. Harris A.W. Jacks T. Cory S. Cell. 1994; 79: 329-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 26Brady H.J.M. Salomons G.S. Bobeldijk R.C. Berns A.J.M.

The discrepant results obtained in these systems were recently reconciled by the suggestion that, in some cell types (e.g. SKW6.4 cells), CD95 effectively activates caspase-8 at the DISC and induces activity of effector caspases independent of a mitochondrial contribution. In other cell types (e.g. Jurkat cells), caspase-8 activation at the DISC is inefficient, and a contribution of the mitochondrial pathway is required for effective induction of apoptosis (50Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar). Our findings in Jurkat cells are consistent with those of Scaffidi et al. (50Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar): detectable CD95-induced caspase-8 activation is slow and inhibited by Bcl-2 overexpression. However, we find that CD95-induced cytochrome c release is inhibited by FLIPLoverexpression, indicating that caspase-8 signals to the mitochondria. Most likely, undetectable amounts of activated caspase-8 generated in the DISC are sufficient to initiate the apoptosis pathway. Recently, caspase-8 was shown to induce cytochrome c release from the mitochondria via its substrate Bid, a Bcl-2-interacting protein (56Li H. Zhu H. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3765) Google Scholar,57Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3061) Google Scholar). Apparently, CD95 signaling can diverge at caspase-8, with one branch of the pathway leading directly to effector caspase activation and the other branch communicating with the mitochondria (50Scaffidi C.

Whether ceramide participates in the apoptosis signaling pathway is unknown, but this possibility is suggested by correlations between lack of a ceramide response and a failure to undergo apoptosis (34Cifone M.G. Roncaioli P. De Maria R. Camarda G. Santoni A. Ruberti G. Testi R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5859-5868Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 37Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3600-3605PubMed Google Scholar) as well as by the finding that exogenous ceramide can activate caspases and induce apoptosis. We have recently found that ceramide production in response to CD95, etoposide, and IR occurs in the absence of effector caspase activation, but depends on inducer caspase activity. 3Tepper, A. D., de Vries, E., van Blitterswijk, W. J., and Borst, J. (1999) J. Clin. Invest. 103,971–978. The failure to mount a ceramide response in the resistant JA clones is therefore not a consequence of defective effector caspase activation, but rather reflects a defect at or downstream from inducer caspase activation.Apoptosis resistance in the JA clones is most likely not due to overexpression of inhibitory Bcl-2 family members since the variant cells were sensitive to apoptosis induction by exogenous ceramide, whereas Bcl-2-overexpressing cells were resistant (Fig. 7). Moreover, immunoblotting for various Bcl-2 family members did not reveal altered expression in JA cells as compared with wild-type Jurkat cells (data not shown). It is also unlikely that the inhibitor ofapoptosis proteins (IAPs) mediate the resistance, since these do not interfere with the release of cytochromec (58Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke S. van Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). Therefore, it will be of great interest to define the cause of common apoptosis resistance in these variant clones.Note Added in Proof-Another study recently reported that FLIP does not inhibit apoptosis induced by DNA damaging regimens in Jurkat cells (Kataoka, T., Schroter, M., Hahne, M., Irmler, M., Thome, M., Froehlich, C. J., and Tschopp, J. (1998) J. Immunol. 161, 3936–3942). Cells can undergo apoptosis in response to a broad spectrum of stimuli, including receptor stimulation, treatment with cytotoxic drugs, and γ-radiation. Although a given stimulus may activate unique signaling molecules, the current model states that the molecular events in the execution phase of apoptotic cell death are shared. Members of the caspase family, which are aspartate-specific cysteine proteases, are key initiators of this execution phase (1Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillnacourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

Their proteolytic action on specific cellular components, including other caspases, structural proteins, and enzymes, leads to the ordered degradation of the cell into apoptotic bodies. Certain members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, including CD95, directly couple to the caspase cascade via their cytoplasmic death domain. Upon multimerization by its trimeric ligand, CD95 recruits the FADD adaptor via its death domain (3Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar).

We employed a commonly used inhibitor of calpain, calpeptin, to examine a role for this protease in the reorganization of the cytoskeleton under a variety of conditions. Calpeptin induced stress fiber formation in both forskolin-treated REF-52 fibroblasts and serum-starved Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. Surprisingly, calpeptin was the only calpain inhibitor of several tested with the ability to induce these effects, suggesting that calpeptin may act on targets besides calpain. Here we show that calpeptin inhibits tyrosine phosphatases, enhancing tyrosine phosphorylation particularly of paxillin. Calpeptin preferentially inhibits membrane-associated phosphatase activity. Consistent with this observation, in vitro phosphatase assays using purified glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins demonstrated a preference for the transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase-α over the cytosolic protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B. Furthermore, unlike wide spectrum inhibitors of tyrosine phosphatases such as pervanadate, calpeptin appeared to inhibit a subset of phosphatases. Calpeptin-induced assembly of stress fibers was inhibited by botulinum toxin C3, indicating that calpeptin is acting on a phosphatase upstream of the small GTPase Rho, a protein that controls stress fiber and focal adhesion assembly. Not only does this work reveal that calpeptin is an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine phosphatases, but it suggests that calpeptin will be a valuable tool to identify the phosphatase activity upstream of Rho.

The small GTP-binding protein Rho belongs to the larger Ras family of small GTPases and has been demonstrated to regulate cytoskeletal reorganization, stimulating the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions in cultured cells (1Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar). Characteristic of all Ras family members, Rho functions as a “molecular switch” in the cell (2Takai Y.

Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar), cycling between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states. The rate of activation and inactivation of this GTPase is regulated by a number of proteins, including guanine nucleotide exchange factors, GTPase-activating proteins, and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (2Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Although considerable insight has been gained into the mechanisms regulating small GTPases such as Rho, many components along the Rho signaling pathway remain to be identified. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation and/or dephosphorylation events play a major role in the Rho-mediated regulation of cytoskeletal reorganization. Evidence for this comes from the use of inhibitors of protein-tyrosine kinases such as genistein (5Ridley A.J. Hall A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2600-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 6Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J.

Since these inhibitors block the enzymatic activity of a wide range of kinases and phosphatases, it is unclear which enzyme(s) are responsible for Rho regulation in these instances. In addition, studies artificially overexpressing soluble PTPases (through microinjection or scrape loading) resulted in disassembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions (12Schneider G.B. Gilmore A.P.

Although there is increasing evidence for PTPases as important players in the regulation Rho and cytoskeletal reorganization (13Yu D.H. Qu C.K. Henegariu O. Lu X. Feng G.S. J. Biol.

The second messenger cAMP also exerts dramatic effects on cytoskeletal architecture. Elevation of cAMP in a variety of cell types induces loss of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, rounding of cells, and in some cases detachment from the underlying substratum (17Lamb N.J.C.

There may be multiple ways in which cAMP can regulate cytoskeletal reorganization, and they may all participate to some extent in the cytoskeletal disassembly associated with cAMP elevation. One potential candidate that may play a role in the disassembly of cytoskeletal structures is the ubiquitous thiol protease calpain. This enzyme localizes to focal adhesions (28Beckerle M.C.

The proteolytic actions of calpain have been postulated to destabilize focal adhesions and sever the linkage between the extracellular matrix and the contractile cytoskeleton of the cell (35Schoenwaelder S.M.

The possible participation of calpain in events requiring remodeling of the cytoskeleton prompted us to investigate the role of this protease in disassembly of the cytoskeleton. Surprisingly, we found that treatment of cells with calpeptin, an inhibitor of calpain, was sufficient to induce stress fiber formation, focal adhesions, and cell contractility. This effect was specific for calpeptin and could not be mimicked by other calpain inhibitors. Furthermore, calpeptin-induced formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions was inhibited by botulinum toxin C3, suggesting that the calpeptin target was upstream of Rho. We report that calpeptin cross-reacts with another family of enzymes, PTPases, which also possess a critical cysteine in their active site. Using this knowledge, we provide evidence for the existence of a PTPase activity, associated with the membrane fraction of cells, which acts upstream of Rho. Calpeptin, PAO, calpain inhibitor 1 (CI-1), recombinant calpastatin, and E64d were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Forskolin was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Dibutyryl cAMP and Protein A-Sepharose were from Sigma.

Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Fluorescein-conjugated anti-human IgG for microinjection was from ICN/Cappel (Aurora, OH). GST constructs for the recombinant PTPases and botulinum toxin C3 were generous gifts from various research laboratories. The catalytic domain of PTP-1B (PTP-37K-1B) (Dr. J.

Feig, Tufts University, Boston, MA). Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and REF-52 fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM as described previously (6Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3643-3654PubMed Google Scholar). Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were serum-starved by incubation in DMEM lacking serum for at least 24 h. In some experiments, cells were preincubated with vehicle alone (Me2SO) (0.1%, v/v) or one of the following compounds: calpeptin (0.1–1.0 mg/ml), E-64d (100 μm), CI-1 (10 μm), pervanadate (50 μm), EGTA/MgCl2 (1 and 2 mm, respectively), or PAO (1 μm). Cells were incubated with these compounds for 30 min at 37 °C, unless otherwise indicated. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (6Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3643-3654PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously (6Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3643-3654PubMed Google Scholar). For isolation of cytosol and membrane fractions, adherent cells were scraped into resuspension buffer (5 mmTris, pH 7.6, 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated six times (8 s each), and then centrifuged at 1,000 × g to remove intact cells and nuclei. Cytosol and membrane fractions were isolated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in Triton X-100-containing buffer. Measurement of protein concentration was determined using the Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent, with bovine serum albumin as a standard, following the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation of paxillin or phosphotyrosine-containing proteins was performed as described previously (6Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3643-3654PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates or immunoprecipitated samples were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) under reducing conditions and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Western blots were performed as described by Towbin et al. (40Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Blots were developed using SuperSignal Substrate for Western blotting (Pierce). Vanadate stock solution was prepared essentially as described (41Gordon J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Pervanadate (50 mm) was prepared by combining 100 μl of vanadate, 88 μl of Tris-buffered saline, and 12 μl of 30% hydrogen peroxide. The pervanadate solution was used within 5 min of preparation. Intracellular cAMP levels were measured as described by Yuan et al. (42Yuan Y. Schoenwaelder S.M. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27090-27098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), using a 3H-labeled cyclic AMP assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The recombinant catalytic subunit of PTP-1B (PTP-37K-1B), the cytoplasmic tail of PTPα, PTEN, and C3 exotransferase were expressed as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli (BL21) as described previously (43Zhong C. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Brown J. Shaub A. Belkin A.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on coverslips and injected with either 100 μg/ml C3 exotransferase or 2 mg/ml recombinant calpastatin (diluted in microinjection buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol)). Cells were coinjected with fluorescein-conjugated anti-human IgG in order to detect injected cells. Cells were returned to the tissue culture incubator to allow for recovery (30–60 min). Whole cell lysates or subcellular fractions from forskolin-treated (10 μm, 30 min) REF-52 or serum-starved (24 h) Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were prepared as described previously (44Gu M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27751-27759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). [32P]poly(Glu:Tyr) substrate was prepared according to the method of Burridge and Nelson (45Burridge K. Nelson A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). All assays were performed within the linear range with respect to protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity. Samples were diluted in phosphatase assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 1 mg/ml BSA, 0.3% β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μm EDTA) to a final volume of 100 μl. Reactions were started by the addition of [32P]poly(Glu:Tyr) (approximately 40,000 cpm) and incubated at 30 °C for 5–20 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid. Tubes were incubated on ice for 10 min and vortexed, and the precipitated protein was pelleted by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 2 min. The supernatant was removed and added to 2 ml of scintillation fluid. Phosphatase activity was determined by the amount of free label released into the supernatant measured by scintillation counting, minus the amount of label released in the absence of lysate. Results are expressed as the mean of several independent experiments. Activation of the thiol protease calpain has been demonstrated to result in the down-regulation of a number of cellular processes including cell spreading, migration, and contraction (35Schoenwaelder S.M.

These processes are all dependent on reorganization of the cytoskeleton. In addition, calpain is localized to focal adhesions, where its activation has been shown to correlate with the proteolysis and loss of various structural and signaling proteins (30Fox J.E.B. Goll D.E. Reynolds C.C. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1060-1066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Oda A. Druker B.J. Ariyoshi H. Smith M. Salzman E.W. J. Biol.

These studies imply a potentially important role for calpain in the disassembly of cytoskeletal architecture. To investigate this possibility, we searched for cell models that could easily be manipulated to induce cytoskeletal disassembly. We chose a rat fibroblast cell line (REF-52) as one of our cell models, since these cells have been demonstrated to rapidly and reversibly lose stress fibers and focal adhesions in response to agents that elevate intracellular levels of cAMP (e.g. forskolin, dibutyryl cAMP) (17Lamb N.J.C. Fernandez A. Conti M.A. Adelstein R. Glass B.B. Welch W.J. Feramisco J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1955-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 46Turner C.E. Pavalko F.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11938-11944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With this cell model, we set out to determine whether calpain was involved in the disassembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions induced by elevated cAMP levels. In order to study the role of calpain inside the cell, it was necessary to perturb the function of this protease. Several synthetic inhibitors have been produced that block calpain activity (47Mehdi S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 150-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 48Wang K.K.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 139-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). One such inhibitor is calpeptin (49Tsujinaka T. Kajiwara Y. Kamayashi J. Sakon M. Higuchi N. Tanaka T. Mori T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 153: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), a dipeptide aldehyde that was designed to bind specifically to the critical cysteine residue in the active site of calpain, preventing the binding and subsequent proteolysis of calpain substrates (48Wang K.K.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 139-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, we began our examination of the role of calpain in regulating the disassembly of stress fibers in our chosen cell model, using calpeptin. Under normal culture conditions, REF-52 fibroblasts displayed a striking array of thick actin stress fibers (Fig. 1 a, A). This organization was dramatically lost in response to treatment with 10 μm forskolin (elevation of cAMP) (Fig. 1 a,B). However, when these cells were treated with the calpain inhibitor calpeptin (100 μg/ml), prior to forskolin treatment, the cells retained their normal actin organization and did not lose their stress fibers (Fig. 1 a, C). We found this effect to be dose-dependent, with noticeable effects at concentrations of calpeptin as low as 20 μg/ml (data not shown). To ensure that the effects of calpeptin were not unique to forskolin, we also performed similar studies using the cAMP derivative, dibutyryl cAMP. Consistent with forskolin treatment, we found that calpeptin could prevent the dibutyryl cAMP-induced loss of stress fibers in REF-52 fibroblasts (data not shown). As a further control, we measured intracellular cAMP levels using a 3H-labeled cAMP assay system and confirmed that calpeptin was not merely acting by lowering cAMP levels inside the cell (data not shown). These results suggest that calpeptin was able to block the disassembly of the cytoskeleton induced by intracellular cAMP elevation. The calpeptin-mediated effects on cAMP-induced disassembly could be due to blocking disassembly or alternatively promoting assembly of stress fibers. To explore the possibility that calpeptin might promote stress fiber assembly, we examined the effect of calpeptin on serum-deprived Swiss 3T3 cells. When Swiss cells are starved of serum for up to 24 h, their actin stress fibers will disassemble (Fig.1 b, A). Previous studies have demonstrated that the addition of serum or serum components such as lysophosphatidic acid will rapidly induce the formation of stress fibers in starved cells via the activation of Rho (1Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar). Strikingly, when calpeptin was added to the serum-free culture medium, Swiss 3T3 cells rapidly (within 30 min) reformed their stress fibers (Fig. 1 b, B), a response reminiscent of serum or lysophosphatidic acid addition. These results are consistent with those obtained using REF-52 fibroblasts and suggest that calpeptin can promote the formation of stress fibers. Although calpeptin has proven to be an effective inhibitor of the calpain-mediated proteolysis of several calpain substrates (30Fox J.E.B. Goll D.E. Reynolds C.C. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1060-1066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Oda A. Druker B.J. Ariyoshi H. Smith M. Salzman E.W. J. Biol.

J. 1996; 318: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), like many other inhibitors its specificity at higher concentrations is questionable. To confirm that calpain was the protein targeted for inhibition by calpeptin, we tested a number of other calpain inhibitors widely used in the literature. These inhibitors were used at concentrations previously demonstrated to block calpain activity (35Schoenwaelder S.M. Yuan Y. Cooray P. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1694-1702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 38Schoenwaelder S.M. Kulkarni S. Salem H.H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Yamao-Harigaya W. Saido T.C. Jackson S.P. J.

Surprisingly, preincubation of REF-52 fibroblasts (Fig. 2) or Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (data not shown) with E64d (100 μm) (Fig.2 a, D) or CI-1 (10 μm) (Fig.2 a, E) did not prevent the forskolin-induced disassembly of stress fibers. Since calpain is a calcium-dependent protease, we tried chelation of calcium, which is an effective method of inhibiting calpain activation. However, consistent with CI-1 and E64d, incubation of REF-52 fibroblasts with a combination of EGTA (1 mm) and Mg2+ (2 mm) (Fig. 2 a, F) had no effect on the forskolin-induced disassembly of stress fibers. Finally and most convincingly, the introduction of recombinant calpastatin (the endogenous and highly specific inhibitor of calpain) into these cells did not block forskolin-induced events (Fig. 2 b). These results suggested that calpain was not the target of calpeptin in these studies and thus not responsible for the disassembly of stress fibers under conditions of elevated intracellular cAMP or deprivation of serum. Further evidence ruling out calpain as the target of calpeptin in these experiments came from studies in which we demonstrated that calpeptin could reverse stress"

Previous characterization of enzymatic activities from Plasmodium soluble extracts, responsible for in vitro hydrolysis of erythrocyte spectrin, had shown that the hydrolysis process occurred at pH 5.0 and involved aspartic protease(s) cleaving mainly within the SH3 motif of the spectrin α-subunit. Therefore, we used a recombinant construct of the erythroid SH3 motif as substrate to investigate the involvement of plasmepsins in spectrin hydrolysis. Using specific anti-plasmepsin II antibodies in Western blotting experiments, plasmepsin II was detected in chromatographic fractions enriched in the parasite SH3 hydrolase activity. Involvement of plasmepsin II in hydrolysis was demonstrated by mass spectrometry identification of cleavage sites in the SH3 motif, upon hydrolysis by Plasmodium extract enzymatic activity, and by recombinant plasmepsin II. Furthermore, recombinant plasmepsin II digested native spectrin at pH 6.8, either purified or situated in erythrocyte ghosts. Additional degradation of actin and protein 4.1 from ghosts was observed. Specific antibodies were used in confocal imaging of schizont-infected erythrocytes to localize plasmepsin II in mature stages of the parasite development cycle; antibodies clearly labeled the periphery of the parasites.

Malaria is a tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasitePlasmodium. In 1996, the World Health Organization estimated the annual mortality at 1.7–2.5 million and persons living in risk areas at ∼2 billion. Resistance of Plasmodium to antimalarial drugs and vector resistance to insecticides are increasing problems in fighting the parasite. New approaches to chemotherapy based on blocking essential metabolic pathways of the parasite are necessary. Toward this end, the parasite proteases that are involved in crucial steps of Plasmodium development appear to be good targets. Several have been described that are involved in hemoglobin hydrolysis (the so-called hemoglobinases), antigen maturation, merozoite release, or invasion of new red blood cells by merozoites (1Schrével J. Deguercy A. Mayer R. Monsigny M. Blood Cells (N. Y.). 1990; 16: 563-584PubMed Google Scholar). Among the Plasmodium proteases, the hemoglobinases have been extensively studied (2Francis S.E. Sullivan Jr., D.J. Goldberg D.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 97-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). In the food vacuole (pH 5–5.4), the 37-kDa aspartic proteases plasmepsin I and plasmepsin II initiate cleavage of the native hemoglobin tetramers, whereas the 28-kDa cysteine protease falcipain appears to digest the denatured or fragmented substrate (3Gluzman I.Y.

Tyas L. Phylip L.H. Kay J. Dunn B.D. Berry C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The 38-kDa enzyme showed kinetic properties similar to those of native plasmepsin II (8Luker K.E. Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus far, no clear difference in structure or function has emerged between plasmepsins I and II, and the reason why the parasite synthesizes both enzymes remains obscure. Unexpectedly, our work on the involvement of proteases in the invasion process yields new insights into the substrate selectivity of plasmepsin II compared with plasmepsin I. Many years ago, the depletion of spectrin and protein 4.1, two major proteins of the erythrocyte membrane cytoskeleton, was described for infected red blood cells during the schizogonic stage ofPlasmodium berghei (9Weidekamm E. Wallach D.F.H. Lin P.S. Hendricks J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 323: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A Plasmodium lophurae37-kDa cathepsin D was reported to digest spectrin and bands 2.1, 2.6, and 3 from duckling and human red blood cells at both pH 3.5 and 7.4 (10Sherman I.W. Tanigoshi L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1983; 8: 207-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Also, a 37-kDa acidic proteinase, able to cleave spectrin and protein 4.1 from human erythrocytes at both pH 5.0 and 7.2, was purified from soluble extracts of P. falciparum and P. berghei (11Deguercy A. Hommel M. Schrével J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 38: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In 1996, another P. falciparumproteolytic activity, clearly inhibited by 10–20 μmpepstatin A and involving protease(s) in the 35–40-kDa range, was described to act at acidic pH on human spectrin (12Le Bonniec S. Fournier F. Deregnaucourt C. Grellier P. Dhermy D. Lecomte M.C. Schrével J. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1996; 319: 1011-1017PubMed Google Scholar). This “spectrinase activity” cleaved the α-spectrin at a site located within the SH3 motif of the molecule. Owing to the fact that plasmepsins I and II are pepstatin A-inhibitable acidic proteinases with a molecular mass of 37 kDa, we investigated the presence of these hemoglobinases in P. falciparumchromatographic fractions enriched for the SH3 hydrolase activity. Plasmepsin II was found in the most active fractions. Mass spectrometry identification of cleavage sites in the SH3 motif upon digestion by recombinant plasmepsin II or by spectrinase activity unambiguously established involvement of plasmepsin II in in vitrohydrolysis of the SH3 motif. The recombinant enzyme proved to be able to digest native spectrin at pH 6.8, either purified or in erythrocyte ghosts. Confocal microscopy analysis of infected erythrocytes with anti-plasmepsin II antibodies showed that the enzyme can be visualized outside the parasite in mature stages of Plasmodium. These results strengthen the idea of plasmepsin II being devoted to function(s) other than hemoglobin degradation in infected red blood cells and, more generally, address the question of the redistribution of some specific proteases during the intraerythrocytic development ofP. falciparum. Saponin andN α-benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin fluorogenic substrate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chimie (St. Quentin Fallavier, France). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit Ig antibodies and tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse Ig antibodies were purchased from Nordic Immunological Laboratories. Construction of the recombinant GST 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathioneS-transferase; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MALDI-TOF-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline -SH3 peptide and linkage to Sepharose beads have been previously described (12Le Bonniec S.

The FcB1 strain from Colombia was used throughout the experiments. Culture was performed according to Trager and Jensen (13Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar). Basic culture medium contained RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 25 mmHepes, 27.5 mm NaHCO3, and 11 mmglucose (pH 7.4) supplemented with penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 7% (v/v) heat-treated human plasma. Red blood cells from the same donor were added at a hematocrit of 2–3%, and the culture was maintained under an atmosphere of 3% CO2, 6% O2, and 91% N2 at 37 °C, with daily medium changes. Synchronization of cultures was achieved by Plasmagel treatment (14Pasvol G. Wilson R.J.M. Smalley M.E. Brown J. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1978; 72: 87-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), followed, 4–5 h later, by 5% (w/v) sorbitol treatment (15Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2855) Google Scholar). Under our culture conditions, the in vitro life cycle of the FcB1 strain was 48 h. 100,000 × g extracts from the schizont stage of P. falciparum were prepared as described by Le Bonniec et al. (12Le Bonniec S. Fournier F. Deregnaucourt C. Grellier P. Dhermy D. Lecomte M.C. Schrével J. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1996; 319: 1011-1017PubMed Google Scholar). For enrichment of acidic spectrinase activity, gel filtration of 100,000 × g extracts on Superose 12 and chromatography on alkyl-Sepharose were performed using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The gel filtration procedure has been described (12Le Bonniec S. Fournier F. Deregnaucourt C. Grellier P. Dhermy D. Lecomte M.C. Schrével J. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1996; 319: 1011-1017PubMed Google Scholar). For spectrinase enrichment through hydrophobic interactions, pooled active fractions from Superose 12 were applied to an alkyl-Superose HR 5/5 column equilibrated in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 2 m ammonium sulfate. Elution was performed with a gradient of ammonium sulfate from 2 to 0 m in 100 mm phosphate buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Usually, 1-ml fractions were collected and tested for their SH3-hydrolyzing activity at pH 5.0 using the recombinant GST-SH3 peptide as substrate. Conditions for high performance electrophoresis chromatography analysis (system from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) have been described previously (12Le Bonniec S. Fournier F. Deregnaucourt C. Grellier P. Dhermy D. Lecomte M.C. Schrével J. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1996; 319: 1011-1017PubMed Google Scholar). Hemoglobin-free erythrocyte membranes were prepared according to Dodge et al. (16Dodge A.R. Mitchell C. Hanahan D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1963; 100: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3636) Google Scholar). Human spectrin was purified by incubating erythrocytes at 37 °C for 30 min in 0.3 mm sodium phosphate and 0.1 mmEDTA. After centrifugation at 300,000 × g for 1 h, the supernatant containing primarily spectrin and actin (17Morrow J.S. Speicher D.W. Knowles W.J. Hsu C.J. Marchesi V.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6592-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) was concentrated and enriched for spectrin by ultrafiltration using Centriprep-100 units (Amicon, Inc., Epernon, France). All enzymatic reactions were performed at 37 °C in 25 mm Tris adjusted to pH 6.8 or 5.0 with citrate. Usually, tests of the spectrinase-enriched fraction against GST-SH3 were performed at a ratio of 1 volume of pelleted GST-SH3-Sepharose beads (12Le Bonniec S. Fournier F. Deregnaucourt C. Grellier P. Dhermy D. Lecomte M.C. Schrével J. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1996; 319: 1011-1017PubMed Google Scholar) to 4 volumes of the enzymatic fraction. Tests of purified recombinant plasmepsin II (8Luker K.E. Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) against GST-SH3 were performed by incubating 10 μl of pelleted beads with 0.5 μg of enzyme. Tests of recombinant plasmepsin II against native spectrin was performed by incubating 0.5 μg of enzyme with 50 μg of spectrin. When indicated, recombinant plasmepsin was incubated prior to tests at pH 5.0 and 37 °C for 2 h to induce maturation of the 43-kDa precursor form to the 38-kDa form by autoactivation. Prior to mass spectrometry analysis of SH3 hydrolysis, the GST-SH3 peptide linked to Sepharose beads was incubated for 2 h at pH 5.0 and 37 °C with the spectrinase-enriched fraction recovered by gel filtration or was incubated for 3 h at pH 5 and 37 °C with recombinant plasmepsin II. The presence of released fragments was checked by electrophoresis on Tricine gel, which allows visualization of small peptides (18Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). For kinetic analysis of SH3 cleavage by the spectrinase activity, aliquots were taken after 1, 2, and 3 min of incubation of the recombinant peptide with the spectrinase-enriched fraction. The spectrinase-enriched fraction, recombinant plasmepsin II, and GST-SH3, alone and under the same experimental conditions, were used as controls in mass spectrometry analyses. After digestion of the SH3 motif with either recombinant plasmepsin II or the spectrinase-enriched fraction, the released peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). After digestion, the samples were acidified by performing a dilution (1:2 to 1:10) in a 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid solution. The MALDI matrix used was 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Aldrich). The acidified samples were then mixed 1:1 (v/v) with a saturated solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed. After determination of their molecular masses, cleavage sites in the SH3 motif were identified. MALDI-TOF-MS measurements were performed on a Voyager Elite mass spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystems, Inc., Framingham, MA) in positive ion reflectron mode using a delayed extraction. For laser desorption, a nitrogen laser beam (λ = 337 nm) was used. Typically, 150–256 shots were averaged for each acquired spectrum. External calibration was performed using a mixture of neurotensin, ACTH clip-(18–39), and ACTH-(7–38) with m/z ratios corresponding to monoisotopic [M + H]+ of 1672.92 and 2465.20 and average [M + H]+ of 3660.19, respectively. Only the averagem/z ratios of the protonated peptides are given under “Results.” The difference between the calculated average mass and the experimental mass determination was <0.5 atomic mass unit. Electrophoresis was performed on 10 and 15% acrylamide gels according to Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes according to Towbinet al. (20Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-plasmepsin I and anti-plasmepsin II antibodies (21Francis S.E. Banerjee R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14961-14968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) were used at a 1:2500 dilution. Smears of asynchronous cultures of the FcB1 strain were fixed for 2 min at −20 °C in acetone/methanol (7:3, v/v). Double labeling of cells with anti-plasmepsin II polyclonal antibodies (serum 737 (21Francis S.E. Banerjee R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14961-14968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar); 1:200 in PBS and 3% nonfat milk (pH 7.5)) and anti-MSP1 (merozoitesurface protein 1) monoclonal antibodies (ascites 22-2 (22Grellier P. Précigout E. Valentin A. Carcy B. Schrével J. Biol. Cell. 1994; 82: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar); 1:50 in PBS and 3% nonfat milk (pH 7.5)) was performed by successive incubations (2 h, room temperature) with the respective antibodies. After washing in PBS and 3% nonfat milk (3 × 10 min), slides were incubated with mixed tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse Ig antibodies (1:50) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit Ig antibodies (1:100) in PBS and 3% nonfat milk for 2 h at room temperature. Control slides for labeling of cells with secondary antibodies and nonimmune rabbit serum were processed in parallel. Slides were washed in PBS (3 × 10 min) and mounted in FluoroGuardTM antifade reagent (Bio-Rad) under a coverslip. Observations were made using a confocal laser scanning microscope (MRC 1024, Bio-Rad). Owing to the acidic pH activity of the parasite SH3 hydrolase, we looked for the presence of the three hemoglobinases plasmepsin I, plasmepsin II, and falcipain in the fractions recovered by gel filtration of a 100,000 × g extract from the schizont stage of the FcB1 strain of P. falciparum. The spectrinase activity was localized in the eluted fractions via hydrolysis of the recombinant GST-SH3 peptide at pH 5.0 and 37 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining of the gel. In controls for each fraction omitting GST-SH3, the amount of protein in the 30–50-kDa range was too low to be detected (data not shown). Plasmepsins I and II were visualized by Western blotting of the fractions using specific anti-plasmepsin I (serum 574) and anti-plasmepsin II (serum 737) antibodies. The presence of falcipain was checked by hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrateN α-benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (23Rosenthal P.J. McKerrow J.H. Rasnick D. Leech J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 35: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Distribution of the spectrinase activity (Fig. 1 A) showed that fractions 8 and 9 contained the highest SH3-hydrolyzing activity, and plasmepsin II was clearly visualized in these fractions (Fig.1 C). In contrast, plasmepsin I, although also a 37-kDa protein, was visualized in fractions 4–9, peaking in fraction 4 (Fig.1 B), which corresponds to eluted proteins with ∼100-kDa molecular masses. As chromatography was performed under nondenaturing conditions, early elution of plasmepsin I might be due to protein-protein interactions. Low SH3-hydrolyzing activity was detected in plasmepsin I-containing fractions compared with plasmepsin II-containing fractions. With respect to falcipain, degradation of the Phe-Arg 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin substrate was observed with fractions 9 and 10 (Fig. 1 D) and was minimal in fraction 8, which had high proteolytic activity against the SH3 motif. Also, falcipain is a cysteine protease, hence is not inhibited by pepstatin A, in contrast to what was observed with the spectrinase activity. To test the hypothesis that the enzyme(s) responsible for SH3 hydrolysis might be different from plasmepsin II, various biochemical procedures were tried to separate plasmepsin II from the SH3 hydrolase activity. 100,000 × g schizont extracts from different cultures of the FcB1 strain were fractionated by gel filtration on a Superose 12 column, and active fractions were further enriched either by chromatography on alkyl-Sepharose or by high performance electrophoresis chromatography. As done previously, the eluted fractions were analyzed for the presence of plasmepsin II and SH3 hydrolase. In every experiment, plasmepsin II was found to coelute with the SH3-hydrolyzing activity (data not shown). The presence of plasmepsin II in the SH3-hydrolyzing fractions prompted us to investigate the involvement of this enzyme in SH3 degradation. The recombinant enzyme was used in enzymatic assays with the recombinant GST-SH3 peptide as substrate. Recombinant plasmepsin II was incubated with substrate at pH 5.0 and 37 °C for different times, and GST-SH3 proteolysis was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining of the proteins (Fig.2). Under these conditions, the recombinant enzyme proved to be able to cleave GST-SH3, generating three fragments at 34, 32, and 30 kDa, a similar pattern to the one observed with the spectrinase-enriched fraction from gel filtration of a 100,000 × g schizont extract (12Le Bonniec S. Fournier F. Deregnaucourt C. Grellier P. Dhermy D. Lecomte M.C. Schrével J. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1996; 319: 1011-1017PubMed Google Scholar). To unambiguously clarify the involvement of plasmepsin II in the SH3 hydrolysis, the identification of SH3 cleavage sites upon spectrinase action and upon recombinant plasmepsin II action was undertaken by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of the released fragments. The recombinant GST-SH3 peptide linked to Sepharose beads was incubated at pH 5.0 and 37 °C with recombinant plasmepsin II or with a spectrinase-enriched fraction recovered by gel filtration of a 100,000 × g schizont extract. Hydrolysis products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a Tricine gel, allowing the visualization of peptides in the 1–5-kDa range (data not shown). Sepharose beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. The identified cleavage sites along the amino acid sequence of the SH3 motif are reported in Fig.3. Six sites were identified due to cleavage by the spectrinase-enriched fraction (Fig. 3, sequence 2). They are distributed within three “regions” of cleavage, showing one site (F↓Q), two sites (Y↓V, R↓R) and three contiguous sites (L↓L, L↓S, S↓S) of cleavage, respectively. Location of the cleavage regions along the amino acid sequence corresponds to the expected generation of the 34-, 32-, and 30-kDa proteolytic fragments. Five sites were identified due to cleavage by recombinant plasmepsin II (Fig. 3, sequence 1). Out of the five, four corresponded to the F↓Q, Y↓V, L↓L, and L↓S sites identified upon digestion of the SH3 motif by the spectrinase fraction. The fifth site (F↓I) was located outside the SH3 amino acid sequence, in the recombinant plasmid sequence. Although mass quantitation of the hydrolysis fragments is difficult by MALDI-TOF-MS, the intensity of some peaks was highly reproducible from one experiment to the other, suggesting that the corresponding sites were highly susceptible to cleavage. From this, the Y↓V and S↓S sites appear as major sites of cleavage with the spectrinase fraction, and Y↓V and L↓L are major sites with plasmepsin II. Minor sites with the spectrinase fraction and plasmepsin II are R↓R, L↓L, and L↓S and F↓I and L↓S, respectively. A very minor site at F↓Q was revealed for both enzymatic activities. Two main conclusions must be drawn from these results. First, plasmepsin II is unambiguously and predominantly involved in thein vitro hydrolysis of the SH3 motif observed with the parasite spectrinase fraction; and second, enzyme(s) other than plasmepsin II are involved in this hydrolysis, cleaving at the R↓R and S↓S sites. To detail the sequence of events due to respective enzymes in the spectrinase fraction, kinetic analysis of the cleavage processes was performed by MALDI-TOF-MS. The identity of the peptides released upon hydrolysis of Sepharose bead-linked GST-SH3 was assessed after 1, 2, and 3 min of enzymatic incubation (Fig. 3, sequence 3). The Y↓V site (attributed to cleavage by plasmepsin II) was first cleaved at 1 min, and then the S↓S site at 2 min. Next, the L↓L and L↓S sited (both due to plasmepsin II) and the R↓R site were cleaved off within 3 min. From this, we can infer that cleavage of the S↓S site is due to an additional endopeptidase cleaving the fragment -SSINK … VPAVY. Hydrolysis of purified human erythroid spectrin by thePlasmodium acidic spectrinase activity generates three main fragments at 170, 150, and 125 kDa (12Le Bonniec S. Fournier F. Deregnaucourt C. Grellier P. Dhermy D. Lecomte M.C. Schrével J. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1996; 319: 1011-1017PubMed Google Scholar). The generation of the 170- and 125-kDa fragments was explained by enzyme(s) cutting within the SH3 motif of the spectrin α-subunit. Because plasmepsin II was found to be part of the acting proteinases in the so-called spectrinase activity, we tested the ability of recombinant plasmepsin II to digest purified native spectrin in order to compare the proteolysis pattern with the one generated by the spectrinase activity. Spectrin from normal erythrocytes was incubated with recombinant plasmepsin II for 1 h, 2 h, and overnight at pH 6.8 and 37 °C. The recombinant enzyme had been preincubated or not for 2 h at pH 5.0 since such conditions induce autoactivation and shortening of the molecule from 43 to 38 kDa (7Hill J. Tyas L. Phylip L.H. Kay J. Dunn B.D. Berry C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Spectrin hydrolysis was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining of the proteins. Results from the overnight incubation are presented in Fig.4 A. At pH 6.8, hydrolysis of spectrin by the 43-kDa form of the enzyme occurred, generating four major fragments at 170, 155, 148, and 125 kDa (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). These fragment sizes are very close to the ones described upon spectrin degradation by the spectrinase activity. Interestingly, greater degradation of spectrin was observed at pH 6.8 in the presence of the 38-kDa form of recombinant plasmepsin II, with an additional proteolytic fragment at 112 kDa (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). Degradation of the GST-SH3 peptide by 43-kDa recombinant plasmepsin II was analyzed at pH 6.8 as well. Hydrolysis was slower than that observed at pH 5.0 (under conditions in which 43-kDa plasmepsin II is activated to 38 kDa), but it generated the expected pattern of 34-, 32-, and 30-kDa fragments (Fig. 4 B). The recombinant plasmepsin II activity was tested against ghosts from normal erythrocytes to check if native spectrin, situated within the protein network of the membrane skeleton, would be a substrate for the enzyme and if other proteins from the ghosts would be substrates as well. Erythrocytes were lysed in 5 mm PO4 buffer (pH 6.8), washed with the same buffer, and incubated overnight at pH 6.8 and 37 °C with the 43- or 38-kDa form of recombinant plasmepsin II. Degradation of the proteins from ghosts was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining of the gel. As shown in Fig. 5 (lane 3), the pattern of the ghosts was dramatically altered in the presence of 38-kDa plasmepsin II. Densitometric analysis of the gel gave a 84% disappearance of the α-spectrin and a 52% disappearance of the β-spectrin with the 38-kDa form of the enzymeversus almost unchanged α- and β-spectrin amounts in the presence of the 43-kDa form (Fig. 5, lane 2). Also, the amount of protein 4.1 decreased in the presence of 38-kDa plasmepsin II, and actin clearly disappeared. To address the question of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton being a physiologically relevant substrate of plasmepsin II in mature parasite-infected cells, we investigated (by confocal microscopy) the cellular location of the enzyme during the schizont stage. Previous immunoelectron microscopy experiments (5Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Oksman A. Knickerbocker A. Mueller R. Bryant M.L. Sherman D.R. Russel D.G. Goldberg D.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) had shown that plasmepsins are present at the surface of the parasite in trophozoites, but no analysis of plasmepsin location later during parasite intraerythrocytic development was available thus far. Smears of FcB1-infected red blood cells were fixed in acetone/methanol, and double labeling of cells was performed using rabbit anti-plasmepsin II polyclonal antibodies (serum 737) and mouse anti-MSP1 monoclonal antibody (ascites 22-2). Anti-MSP1 antibody was used to visualize mature intraerythrocytic parasites via labeling of the parasite membrane. Preservation of red blood cells upon fixation was checked by phase-contrast microscopy. No labeling was observed with non- immune rabbit serum (data not shown) or with secondary antibodies alone (data not shown). Images of immunolabeled cells, summed from three 10-nm spaced out sections each, are presented in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 A shows an ∼40-h-old schizont; although MSP1 labeling is confined to the parasite (panel 3), fleecy labeling with anti-plasmepsin II antibodies can be observed inside and outside the parasite (panel 2). The presence of anti-plasmepsin II antibody labeling in the erythrocyte cytoplasm, although not found in all schizonts, was frequently observed. In Fig. 6 B is presented an early segmenter (44–46 h old). Remarkably, plasmepsin II labeling appears to delineate individualizing merozoites, in a comparable way to MSP1 labeling, although MSP1 and plasmepsin II labeling does not totally merge; labeled plasmepsin II appears as a green rim external to the yellowMSP1-delineated membrane. Most of the current efforts in understanding the biology ofPlasmodium aim at elaborating new antimalarial strategies. Protease inhibitors have been successfully employed in well known examples such as AIDS therapy, and identification of target proteases in Plasmodium is today part of the antimalarial fight. In this respect, the hemoglobinases, as participants in an essential metabolic pathway, appear to be choice targets. Plasmepsins I and II are both responsible for the initial cleavage of hemoglobin in the digestive vacuole of the intraerythrocytic parasite, but when a specific inhibitor of plasmepsin I (SC-50083) is added to cultures at the trophozoite stage, when hemoglobin is degraded, the parasites have markedly diminished hemozoin production and are killed (IC50 = 2 × 10−6m) (5Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Oksman A. Knickerbocker A. Mueller R. Bryant M.L. Sherman D.R. Russel D.G. Goldberg D.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This indicates that plasmepsin I activity is essential, but also that plasmepsins I and II have distinct hemoglobin-degrading capacities. Moreover, the inability of plasmepsin II to supplant plasmepsin I in hemoglobin degradation raises the question of the exact role of plasmepsin II in this process. We show here that proteins other than hemoglobin can be substrates of plasmepsin II, namely spectrin, protein 4.1, and actin, all components of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton. Since plasmepsin I was shown to be inactive against a variety of non-globin substrates (2Francis S.E. Sullivan Jr., D.J. Goldberg D.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 97-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) and was also found to be poorly active on the GST-SH3 substrate, in contrast to plasmepsin II, these findings reinforce the idea that the two enzymes may be devoted to different roles in the parasitized cell. The identification of the five sites cleaved at pH 5.0 by recombinant plasmepsin II in the SH3 motif of the spectrin α-subunit is in general agreement with the known preference of plasmepsin II for hydrophobic residues on both sides of the scissile bond (3Gluzman I.Y. Francis S.E. Oksman A. Smith C.E. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1602-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Only two sites, L↓S and F↓Q, show a hydrophobic residue at the P1 position and a hydrophilic one at the P1′ position, extending the repertoire of the potential sites of cleavage for plasmepsin II. For plasmepsin I, if one considers amino acids at the P1 and P1′ positions, two putative cleavage sites can be identified within the SH3 motif: the F↓Q site, deduced from the plasmepsin I preference for the phenylalanine at the P1 position, and the L↓L site, listed as a secondary site on hemoglobin (3Gluzman I.Y. Francis S.E. Oksman A. Smith C.E. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1602-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The presence of 32–30-kDa fragment(s) upon hydrolysis of GST-SH3 by fraction 4 and adjacent functions in Fig. 1 could thus be attributed to plasmepsin I action. However, fractions in which plasmepsin II was readily detected compared with plasmepsin I (fractions 8–10) displayed higher degradative activity. This observation suggests that, most probably, recognition of potential cleavage sites in the SH3 motif by plasmepsins I and II involves additional parameters such as identity of the surrounding amino acids and/or conformation of the polypeptide chain. In the same way, the number of spectrin sites actually cleaved by plasmepsin II appears limited since a 20-h hydrolysis of purified native spectrin at pH 6.8 by recombinant plasmepsin II produces high molecular mass fragments, although many potential sites are found scattered along the α- and β-subunit amino acid sequences, predicting the generation of multiple short sized fragments. Conformational requirements might explain why the SH3 motif, whose secondary structure is different from the repetitive structure of the rest of the α-chain, is a privileged target for the enzyme. This interpretation would go along with what has been written about the enzyme specificity depending on the tertiary structure of its substrate hemoglobin (24Goldberg D.E. Slater A.F.G. Beavis R. Chait B. Cerami A. Henderson G.B. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Recombinant plasmepsin II can digest the SH3 motif of α-spectrin, as well as native spectrin, at pH 6.8. In terms of activity of the enzyme on the GST-SH3 substrate, hydrolysis of the substrate at pH 5.0 is completed within 75 min, whereas at pH 6.8, primary degradation fragments are visible. Thus, the pH optimum of the enzymatic activity does not seem to differ from hemoglobin to the GST-SH3 substrate. The activities of purified native plasmepsins II and I on hemoglobin are known to be dramatically reduced at pH 6.5. In both cases, ∼35% residual activity is detected (24Goldberg D.E. Slater A.F.G. Beavis R. Chait B. Cerami A. Henderson G.B. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Further experiments are needed to quantify the activity of the recombinant enzyme against the SH3 motif at pH 6.8 and to compare it with its activity against hemoglobin at the same pH. An interesting observation is the enhanced efficiency of recombinant plasmepsin II in degrading spectrin after it has been shortened to 38 kDa by autoactivation at pH 5.0. Previous studies had demonstrated that the structural and kinetic properties of mature recombinant plasmepsin II and native plasmepsin II were similar (8Luker K.E. Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but nothing is known about the activity of the precursor form of recombinant plasmepsin II since all experiments were performed at pH 5.0. We observed that within 20 h at pH 6.8, the hydrolysis pattern of native spectrin, either purified or from ghosts, was greater when due to the mature form of the enzyme than to the precursor form. One explanation might be that the enzyme has slowly autoactivated to the 38-kDa form at pH 6.8. If not, this might indicate that some of the properties of the enzyme differ between immature and mature forms in terms of structural and/or kinetic properties. Our results raise the question of the physiological relevance of observations made in vitro. Indeed, two points must be considered. First, the red blood cell skeleton and plasmepsin II were believed to belong to distinct cellular compartments; and second, to cleave skeleton proteins, plasmepsin II would need to act at a pH near neutrality in the cytoplasm of the red blood cell. Now, the enzyme has been found to be active at pH 6.8 against spectrin, actin, and protein 4.1, which suggests that it could be active in the red blood cell cytoplasm. Confocal imaging using anti-plasmepsin II antibodies brought clear evidence of a possible proximity between the enzyme and membrane skeleton during late parasite maturation. What has been inferred about plasmepsin I and plasmepsin II trafficking, largely deduced from the study of plasmepsin I trafficking, is that plasmepsins are secretory molecules that are synthesized as type II integral membrane proteins (21Francis S.E. Banerjee R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14961-14968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The proplasmepsins have been detected by immunoelectron microscopy at the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (5Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Oksman A. Knickerbocker A. Mueller R. Bryant M.L. Sherman D.R. Russel D.G. Goldberg D.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and visualization of plasmepsin II outside the parasite by immunoconfocal microscopy might be due to parasitophorous membrane-originated structures extending into the red blood cell cytoplasm. Plasmepsin II in early segmenters was found located at the periphery of the parasite, and labeling appeared higher at this stage than in younger schizonts, even though massive degradation of hemoglobin is not required anymore. Considering the broad substrate selectivity and cleavage site specificity of plasmepsin II and the large amount as well as the location of the enzyme in late schizonts, the overall results presented here strongly suggest that plasmepsin II function in the parasite intraerythrocytic cycle is not restricted to hemoglobin degradation. Its involvement in spectrin depletion in vivo remains to be established, but it is clear that trafficking of plasmepsins and their respective roles in the infected cell must be further explored. We are very grateful to Marie-Christine Lecomte and Catherine Fournier (INSERM; U.409) for providing the recombinant GST-SH3 clone and to Prof. Jean Rossier for fruitful collaboration between the Laboratoire de Neurobiologie at the Ecole Supérieure de Physique et Chimie Industrielles and our laboratory."
https://openalex.org/W2045591496,"Although nitric oxide (NO) has potent antiplatelet actions, the signaling pathways affected by NO in the platelet are poorly understood. Since NO can induce platelet disaggregation and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) activation renders aggregation irreversible, we tested the hypothesis that NO exerts its antiplatelet effects at least in part by inhibiting PI3-kinase. The results demonstrate that the NO donorS-nitrosoglutathione (S-NO-glutathione) inhibits the stimulation of PI3-kinase associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and of p85/PI3-kinase associated with the SRC family kinase member LYN following the exposure of platelets to thrombin receptor-activating peptide. The activation of LYN-associated PI3-kinase was unrelated to changes in the amount of PI3-kinase physically associated with LYN signaling complexes but did require the activation of LYN and other tyrosine kinases. The cyclic GMP-dependent kinase activator 8-bromo-cyclic GMP had similar effects on PI3-kinase activity, consistent with a model in which the cyclic nucleotide mediates the effects of NO. Additional studies showed that wortmannin and S-NO-glutathione have additive inhibitory effects on thrombin receptor-activating peptide-induced platelet aggregation and the surface expression of platelet activation markers. These data provide evidence of a distinct and novel mechanism for the inhibitory effects of NO on platelet function."

To systematically examine the cellular functions of CK2, human osteosarcoma U2-OS cells constitutively expressing a tetracycline-regulated transactivator were stably transfected with a bidirectional plasmid encoding either catalytic isoform of CK2 (i.e. CK2α or CK2α′) together with the regulatory CK2β subunit in order to increase the cellular levels of either CK2 isoform.

Biol. 1992; 12: 5711-5723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although its precise functions remain poorly understood, there is mounting evidence to suggest that CK2 plays an important role in the control of cell proliferation and transformation (3Litchfield D.W.

Cancer Lett. 1996; 101: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and in the lymphocytes of cattle that develop T cell lymphomas following infection with the parasite Theileria parva (14ole-MoiYoi O.K. Brown W.C. Iams K.P. Nayar A. Tsukamoto T. Macklin M.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1621-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the targeted overexpression of CK2α in the T cells of transgenic mice results in the development of lymphomas (15Seldin D.C. Leder P. Science. 1995; 267: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). By crossing different lines of transgenic mice, there is evidence for collaboration between the dysregulated expression of CK2α and the c-Myc and Tal-1 oncogenes in lymphoma development (16Kelliher M.A. Seldin D.C. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5160-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Accelerated lymphomagenesis is also observed when the mice that overexpress CK2 in T cells are crossed with mice deficient in the functional expression of p53 (17Landesman-Bollag E. Channavajhala P.L. Cardiff R.D. Seldin D.C. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2965-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that CK2 contributes to the transformation of primary and established fibroblasts. Overexpression of either catalytic isoform of CK2 (i.e. CK2α or CK2α′) exhibited cooperativity with Ha-Ras in the transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts and Balb/c 3T3 cells (18Orlandini M. Semplici F. Ferruzzi R. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Oliviero S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21291-21297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). All of these observations suggest that the increased expression of CK2 contributes to transformation. By comparison, Hericheet al. (19Heriche J.K. Lebrin F. Rabilloud T. Leroy D. Chambaz E.M. Goldberg Y. Science. 1997; 276: 952-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) observed diminished Ras-dependent transformation when the expression of CK2 was increased in NIH 3T3 cells. Collectively, although there are unresolved discrepancies in the precise role of CK2 in transformation, these studies all demonstrate the potent capacity of CK2 to influence the behavior of cells. CK2 has been detected in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of cells and is believed to phosphorylate regulatory proteins in each of these compartments (5Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 6Pinna L.A. Meggio F. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of CK2 is somewhat unique and has aided in the identification of candidate substrates for CK2. Dozens of proteins have in fact been classified as likely physiological substrates of CK2 because CK2 can phosphorylate a site or sites that are phosphorylated in cells (6Pinna L.A. Meggio F. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Of particular interest to a role in proliferation and/or transformation is the demonstration that the products of proto-oncogenes (i.e. c-Myc (20Luscher B. Kuenzel E.A. Krebs E.G. Eisenman R.N. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), c-Jun (21Lin A. Frost J. Deng T. Smeal T. al-Alawi N. Kikkawa U. Hunter T. Brenner D. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), c-Myb (22Luscher B. Christenson E. Litchfield D.W. Krebs E.G. Eisenman R.N. Nature. 1990; 344: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar)) and the tumor suppressor p53 (23Meek D.W. Simon S. Kikkawa U. Eckhart W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3253-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) are phosphorylatedin vitro by CK2 at sites that are phosphorylated in cells. However, as it has not been possible to reproducibly manipulate the expression of CK2 in cells (24Litchfield D.W. Dobrowolska G. Krebs E.G. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 373-381PubMed Google Scholar), it has not been possible to confirm that alterations in the cellular activity of CK2 result in alterations in the phosphorylation of its potential substrate proteins. Only in yeast that harbor temperature-sensitive alleles of CK2 is there rigorous genetic evidence confirming the identity of some of its cellular targets (25Cardenas M.E. Dang Q. Glover C.V. Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1785-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 26Ghavidel A. Schultz M.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2780-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Glover C.V. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 95-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). CK2 is generally a tetrameric enzyme composed of two catalytic (α) and two regulatory (β) subunits (28Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). The regulatory subunit is generally required for optimal expression of activity and appropriate regulation of substrate specificity (6Pinna L.A. Meggio F. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In mammals, there are two isozymic forms of the catalytic subunit of CK2, designated CK2α and CK2α′, that are the products of distinct genes localized to different chromosomes (29Lozeman F.J. Litchfield D.W. Piening C. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8436-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 30Wirkner U. Voss H. Lichter P. Ansorge W. Pyerin W. Genomics. 1994; 19: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 31Yang-Feng T.L. Naiman T. Kopatz I. Eli D. Dafni N. Canaani D. Genomics. 1994; 19: 173Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Between species, CK2α and CK2α′ exhibit remarkable conservation; between humans and chickens, CK2α exhibits 98% identity and CK2α′ exhibits 97% identity (29Lozeman F.J. Litchfield D.W. Piening C. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8436-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 32Maridor G. Park W. Krek W. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2362-2368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two isoforms are also closely related to each other. Within the domain that contains all of the conserved consensus motifs for members of the protein kinase family, CK2α and CK2α′ exhibit nearly 90% identity. By comparison, CK2α has a C-terminal extension of approximately 60 amino acids that is completely unrelated to the smaller (i.e. approximately 20 amino acids) C-terminal domain of CK2α′. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are also two distinct forms of the catalytic CK2 subunit, designated CKA1 and CKA2 (1Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 33Chen Wu J.L. Padmanabha R. Glover C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4981-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Genetic studies in this organism have demonstrated that CKA1 and CKA2 can compensate for each other but also demonstrates functional specialization for the two CK2 isoforms. Although few direct studies of the independent functional properties of CK2α and CK2α′ have been performed in mammalian cells, there is mounting evidence to suggest that they may also exhibit functional specialization. For example, striking differences in the subcellular localization of CK2α and CK2α′ were observed in HeLa cells (34Yu I.J. Spector D.L. Bae Y.S. Marshak D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, less obvious differences in the localization of CK2 isoforms were subsequently observed in chicken hepatoma cells or fibroblasts (35Krek W. Maridor G. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and in transfected COS-7 cells (36Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), indicating that the control of CK2 localization is complex. There are also indications that the two isoforms of CK2 are independently regulated during cell cycle progression as CK2α is phosphorylated by p34cdc2 during mitosis, whereas CK2α′ is not phosphorylated (37Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Lozeman F.J. Eisenman R.N. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13943-13951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Bosc D.G. Slominski E. Sichler C. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25872-25878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have recently identified cellular proteins that bind to CK2α but not CK2α′. 2D.G. Bosc, K. C. Graham, D. Prober, R. D. Gietz, and D. W. Litchfield, submitted for publication. Collectively, these results provide indications that the two isozymic forms of CK2 could have independent cellular functions. However, efforts to elucidate the precise functions of CK2 have been hindered by the lack of reproducible strategies for manipulating its expression in cells. To systematically examine the role of CK2 in cellular regulation, we have developed cell lines where we can reproducibly manipulate the expression of either CK2 isoform. To increase the expression of CK2, human osteosarcoma U2-OS cells that stably express the tetracycline-regulated transcriptional activator were transfected with a bidirectional plasmid encoding a catalytic subunit of CK2 (i.e. HA epitope-tagged CK2α or CK2α′) together with myc epitope-tagged regulatory CK2β subunit (39Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar, 40Baron U. Freundlieb S. Gossen M. Bujard H.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4662-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). To specifically interfere with signaling events involving CK2α and CK2α′, we also established cell lines expressing kinase-inactive mutants of CK2α or CK2α′ (i.e. HA epitope-tagged CK2α(K68M) or CK2α′(K69M)) along with myc-CK2β (36Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Contrary to the expectation that increased CK2 expression would enhance proliferation (9Munstermann U. Fritz G. Seitz G. Lu Y.P. Schneider H.R. Issinger O.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 18Orlandini M. Semplici F. Ferruzzi R. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Oliviero S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21291-21297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), increased expression of either CK2α or CK2α′ resulted in modest decreases in proliferation. Induced expression of kinase-inactive CK2α differed significantly from the effects observed following induction of similar levels of kinase-inactive CK2α′. Of particular interest is the dramatic attenuation of proliferation that is observed following induction of CK2α′(K69M), but not following induction of CK2α(K68M). These results provide the first direct evidence for functional specialization of CK2 isoforms in mammalian cells. Moreover, by establishing tetracycline-regulatable systems for the control of CK2 expression, we are now in a position for the first time to examine the mechanisms by which CK2 influences proliferation. A construct encoding CK2α with a C-terminal HA epitope tag was generated by first introducing aBlpI site and a stop codon at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, of the HA coding sequence (5′-GGCCGCATCTTTTACCCATACGATGTTCCTGACTATGCGGGCTATGACGTCCCGGACTATGCAGGATCCTATCCATATGACGTTCCAGATTACGCTGCTAGTGCGGCCGC-3′) using a polymerase chain reaction strategy. The following primers were used: 5′-GCTCAGCAGTACCCATACGATGTT-3′ (sense primer) and 5 ′-TTAAGCGTAATCTGGAACGTC-3′ (antisense primer). The sequence was amplified, subcloned into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen), and verified by DNA sequencing (42Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). The TA vector encoding the modified HA sequence was digested with SacI/BlpI, and theSacI/BlpI fragment of CK2α from the hT4.1 plasmid (29Lozeman F.J. Litchfield D.W. Piening C. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8436-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) was subcloned into this TA cloning vector that contained the modified HA sequence. The CK2α-HA cDNA was then subcloned into the HindIII/ApaI sites of pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) to generate pRc/ CMV/CK2α-HA, which was designated pZW6. The kinase-dead mutant of CK2α-HA (i.e. CK2α(K68M)-HA) was generated by first subcloning CK2α-HA from pZW6 into the Bluescript pSK+ cloning vector (Stratagene) using HindIII and ApaI. A BstBI and NcoI fragment from pRc/CMV/HA-CK2α(K68M) (36Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) was then used to replace the wild-type CK2α sequence in pSK+/CK2α-HA to generate pSK+/CK2α(K68M)-HA, which was designated pGV14. AHindIII/ApaI fragment from pGV14 encoding the CK2α(K68M)-HA cDNA was subcloned into the HindIII andApaI sites of pRc/CMV to generate pRc/CMV/CK2α(K68M)-HA, which was designated pGV15. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (42Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). The bidirectional constructs encoding both CK2α-HA or CK2α (K68M)-HA were generated as follows. The myc-CK2β construct was digested from pRc/CMV (36Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with NotI and ApaI. After gel purification, the overhangs on the fragment were filled in, and the fragment was ligated into the EcoRV site (MCS I) of the bidirectional pBI vector (CLONTECH) to generate pBI/myc-CK2β. The CK2α-HA cDNA was isolated from pZW6 usingHindIII and ApaI and ligated into theSalI (MCS II) site of pBI/myc-CK2β to generate pBI/myc-CK2β/CK2α-HA, which was designated pRS3. To generate the bidirectional construct containing kinase-dead CK2α, pRS3 was digested with Bsu36I and BstBI and fragments of 3493 and 2350 base pairs isolated. The third fragment generated in that digestion (containing the sequence that codes for catalytic residue K68) was discarded. Next, pGV15 was digested with BstBI andBsu36I and the DNA fragment containing the K68M mutation was isolated and triple ligated with the 3493- and 2350-base pair fragments to generate pBI/myc-CK2β/CK2α(K68M)-HA (designated pGV13). All constructs were verified by restriction endonuclease digests or DNA sequencing (42Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Bidirectional constructs encoding HA-CK2α′ or HA-CK2α′(K69M) and myc-CK2β were generated as follows. The HA-CK2α′ fragment was digested pRc/CMV/HA-CK2α′ (36Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with HindIII and ligated into pBI/myc-CK2β at the SalI site (MCS II) to generate pBI/myc-CK2β/HA-CK2α′ (designated pRS2). The pBI/myc-CK2β/HA-CK2α′(K69M) plasmid, designated pGV7, was constructed by replacing the HindIII fragment encoding HA-CK2α′ from pRS2 with a HindIII fragment encoding HA-CK2α′(K69M) from pRc/CMV/HA-CK2α′ (36Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by restriction endonuclease digests or DNA sequencing (42Sanger F.

Polyclonal anti-CK2α antiserum directed against the C-terminal synthetic peptide α376–391, polyclonal anti-CK2α′ antiserum directed against the C-terminal synthetic peptide α′333–350, and polyclonal anti-CK2β antiserum directed against the C-terminal synthetic peptide β198–215 have been described previously (37Litchfield D.W.

Polyclonal anti-CK2α antiserum directed against an N-terminal synthetic peptide α2–19 were similarly prepared and was used for the detection of CK2α-HA as the HA epitope interfered with recognition by the antiserum directed against the C-terminal α376–391 peptide. The monoclonal antibody 12CA5, which reacts against the HA epitope (44Field J. Nikawa J.-I. Broek D. Macdonald B. Rogers I. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell.

The hybridoma producing the 9E10 monoclonal antibodies directed against the myc epitope (46Evan G.I. Lewis G. Ramsey G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell.

Goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (AP) were purchased from Bio-Rad. UTA6 cells were derived from the human osteosarcoma cell line U2-OS and express the tetracycline-regulated transcriptional activator fusion protein (generous gift from Dr. Christoph Englert, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Germany) (41Englert C.

The UTA6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotic supplements (0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin), and 460 μg/ml G418 (all obtained from Life Technologies Inc.). UTA6 cells were cotransfected with 5 μg of pTK-hyg plasmid (CLONTECH) and 30 μg of pRS3, pGV13, pGV7, or pRS2 using the standard calcium phosphate method (47Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), with the exception of pGV13 which was cotransfected using the Fugenereagent as per manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Fifteen hours after addition of DNA, the cells were washed and fresh medium was added. Forty-eight hours after the removal of the DNA precipitate, the cells were re-fed with supplemented medium containing 500 μg/ml hygromycin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Colonies that developed after 2 weeks of drug selection were isolated and expanded in preparation for analysis of inducible expression of the epitope-tagged CK2 constructs using Western blotting. Clonal cell lines RS3.22 (expressing CK2α-HA and myc-CK2β), GV13.35 (expressing CK2α(K68M)-HA and myc-CK2β), RS2.31(expressing HA-CK2α′ and myc-CK2β), and GV7.21 (expressing HA-CK2α′(K69M) and myc-CK2β), exhibiting high levels of tightly regulated expression, were maintained in medium containing 460 μg/ml (active) G418, 500 μg/ml hygromycin, and 1.5 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma). Cells were washed twice in PBS, washed once in extraction buffer (50 mmTris-Cl (pH. 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and then extracted with 500 μl of extraction buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (30 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were sonicated twice for 10 s and then centrifuged at 55,000 rpm in a Beckman TL100.2 rotor for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and kept on ice for immediate use or frozen at −80 °C. Cells designated for immunoprecipitation were washed as described above and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and all of the protease and phosphatase inhibitors as above). The extracts were sonicated and spun at 12,000 × g for 15 min to remove debris. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were aliquoted in tubes and volumes equilibrated. The antibodies used were 12CA5 (8 μl/reaction) and 9E10 (0.5 μl/reaction) and 20 μl of a 50% protein A-Sepharose solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the mixture. After incubation by tumbling for 1 h at 4 °C, the protein A-Sepharose was isolated by centrifugation and washed once in lysis buffer and three times in kinase buffer (50 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The pellet was resuspended in kinase buffer and used for kinase assays. CK2 activity was measured in RS3.22, GV13.35, RS2.31, and GV7.21 cell extracts and immunoprecipitates using the synthetic peptide substrate (RRRDDDSDDD) that has been described previously (48Litchfield D.W.

Assays were performed for 5 min at 30 °C in a final reaction volume of 30 μl containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm ATP (specific activity 500–700 cpm/pmol) and RRRDDDSDDD (0.1 mm). Reactions were initiated by addition of 9 μl of cell extract or immunocomplex and were terminated by spotting 10 μl on P81 phosphocellulose paper as described previously (48Litchfield D.W.

The papers were washed four times in 1% phosphoric acid and once in 95% ethanol. Once dry, papers were immersed in scintillant and counted in a Beckman LS 5801 scintillation counter. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in T-buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 50 mmNaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 30 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce), and equal amounts of lysates were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for 1 h at 100 V in blotting buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, 190 mmglycine, 20% methanol) as described by Towbin et al. (49Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Blocking was performed with 3% gelatin in TBS (20 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl) at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was washed twice in TBST (0.05% Tween-20 in TBS) and reacted with either polyclonal anti-α (1/1000), polyclonal anti-α′ (1/400), polyclonal anti-β (1/500), 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (1/500), or 9E10 monoclonal antibody (1/500) in 1% gelatin in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed twice with TBST. Secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with AP and diluted 1/3000 with 1% gelatin in TBST. After reaction for 1 h at room temperature, the membrane was washed twice with TBST and once with TBS. Visualization was performed by developing with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphatep-toluidine salt and p-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Bio-Rad) in AP development buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 9.5), 0.5 mm MgCl2). UTA6, RS3.22, GV13.35, RS2.31, and GV7.21 cells were seeded in six-well dishes at a starting density of 20,000 cells/well in the presence or absence of 1.5 μg/ml tetracycline. Every 24 h, cells were harvested with PBS and 5 mmEDTA and counted with a hemocytometer. Cells were harvested from three individual wells for each cell line. Trypan blue was used to distinguish viable from non-viable cells. The medium was changed every 3 days. RS2.31 and GV7.21 cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells in 10-cm plates in the presence or absence of 1.5 μg/ml tetracycline. The medium was changed every 3 day"
https://openalex.org/W2023859626,"NIPP-1 is a subunit of the major nuclear protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1) in mammalian cells and potently inhibits PP-1 activity in vitro. Using yeast two-hybrid and co-sedimentation assays, we mapped a PP-1-binding site and the inhibition function to the central one-third domain of NIPP-1. Full-length NIPP-1 (351 residues) and the central domain, NIPP-1143–217, were equally potent PP-1 inhibitors (IC50 = 0.3 nm). Synthetic peptides spanning the central domain of NIPP-1 further narrowed the PP-1 inhibitory function to residues 191–200. A second, noninhibitory PP-1-binding site was identified by far-Western assays with digoxygenin-conjugated catalytic subunit (PP-1C) and included a consensus RVXF motif (residues 200–203) found in many other PP-1-binding proteins. The substitutions, V201A and/or F203A, in the RVXF motif, or phosphorylation of Ser199 or Ser204, which are established phosphorylation sites for protein kinase A and protein kinase CK2, respectively, prevented PP-1C-binding by NIPP-1191–210 in the far-Western assay. NIPP-1191–210 competed for PP-1 inhibition by full-length NIPP-11–351, inhibitor-1 and inhibitor-2, and dissociated PP-1C from inhibitor-1- and NIPP-1143–217-Sepharose but not from full-length NIPP-11–351-Sepharose. Together, these data identified some of the key elements in the central domain of NIPP-1 that regulate PP-1 activity and suggested that the flanking sequences stabilize the association of NIPP-1 with PP-1C."
https://openalex.org/W2159038306,"A site-directed photocross-linking approach was employed to determine components that act downstream of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF). To this end, a photolabile phenylalanine analog was incorporated at various positions of the putative effector region of the ARF molecule. Depending on the position of incorporation, we find specific and GTP-dependent interactions of ARF with two subunits of the coatomer complex, β-COP and γ-COP, as well as an interaction with a cytosolic protein (∼185 kDa). In addition, we observe homodimer formation of ARF molecules at the Golgi membrane. These data suggest that the binding site of ARF to coatomer is at the interface of its β- and γ-subunits, and this is in close proximity to the second site of interaction of coatomer with the Golgi membrane, the binding site within γ-COP for cytosolic dibasic/diphenylalanine motifs.

The initial step in the formation of these vesicles involves the recruitment of two factors from the cytosol to the Golgi membrane; ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) binds to Golgi membranes in a GTP-dependent manner (3Donaldson J.G.

Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), capable of binding both the dibasic ER retrieval motifs and the diphenylalanine motifs of members of the p24 family of proteins (9Fiedler K.

Using an affinity column containing a KKXX sequence, a coatomer subcomplex of α-, β′-, and ξ-COP could be isolated (8Cosson P. Letourneur F.

However, using direct photolabeling of intact coatomer with various photolabile peptides containing the dibasic and diphenylalanine motifs, only the γ-COP subunit was labeled, suggesting that coatomer has only one binding site for the various types of these motifs (12Harter C.

The diphenylalanine sequence is present in the C-terminal tails of the members of p24 family of type I membrane proteins (9Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E.

Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Bremser M. Lottspeich F. Fiedler K. Helms J.B. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).We previously used a site-directed photocross-linking approach to elucidate components that interact directly with ARF1 during coat assembly (15Zhao L.Y. Helms J.B. Brugger B. Harter C. Martoglio B. Graf R. Brunner J. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4418-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This method is based on the replacement of an endogenous amino acid with a photolabile analog of phenylalanine,l-4′-(3-trifluoromenthyl-3H-diazirin-3-yl)phenyalanine ((Tmd)Phe) (16Brunner J. Chem. Soc. Rev. 1993; 22: 183-189Crossref Google Scholar, 17Brunner J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 483-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). It was found that this analog in position 82 of ARF1 directly and exclusively interacts with the β-COP subunit of coatomer during the formation of transport vesicles (15Zhao L.Y. Helms J.B. Brugger B. Harter C. Martoglio B. Graf R. Brunner J. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4418-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, it was inferred that a bivalent interaction of coatomer with Golgi membranes via ARF and via members of the p24 family of proteins is involved in the budding of a COPI-coated vesicle (15Zhao L.Y. Helms J.B. Brugger B. Harter C. Martoglio B. Graf R. Brunner J. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and biologically active phospholipids (22Randazzo P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7688-7692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether ARF interacts with additional effector molecules, we inserted the (Tmd)Phe analog at various positions of the putative effector loop of ARF, identified in its crystal structure and based on its similarity with Ras (23Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We find that, depending on the site of insertion, the effector loop of ARF interacts with β-COP, γ-COP, and an as yet unidentified protein of ∼185 kDa. In addition, evidence is presented that ARF is capable of forming a homodimer on Golgi membranes, the function of which remains to be determined.RESULTSIn order to analyze proteins or molecules that act downstream of ARF (effector molecules), we focused on β-sheet β2 (amino acids 41–46) and loop L4 (amino acids 47–50) (23Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). These structures constitute the putative effector region in ARF, based on its similarity with the Ras proteins, as revealed by a comparison of the crystal structure of ARF and Ras (23Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The following criteria were applied for selection of amino acids to be replaced with the photolabile (Tmd)Phe: (i) insertion of the photolabile residue should not change the net charge of the ARF molecule and (ii) the amino acid to be replaced should have an optimal orientation (i.e. facing outward from the ARF molecule) for optimal cross-link efficiencies. Based on these criteria, we choose Val-43, Ile-46, and Ile-49 to be replaced with (Tmd)Phe, resulting in ARF mutants designated ARF-(Tmd)Phe-43, ARF-(Tmd)Phe-46, and ARF-(Tmd)Phe-49, respectively.The photolabile ARF molecules were generated by mutating the corresponding codons of ARF1 cDNA to amber and subsequent in vitro transcription and translation with suppression of this stop codon by addition of suppressor tRNA chemically loaded with the photolabile amino acid analog (see “Experimental Procedures”). Translation in the presence of [35S]methionine allows visualization of the corresponding photolabile full-length protein by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Each mutated and radiolabeled ARF showed a GTP-dependent binding to Golgi membranes, excluding the possibility that replacement of the endogenous amino acid for (Tmd)Phe had severely affected ARF activity (data not shown).Incubation of [35S]ARF-(Tmd)Phe-46 with Golgi membranes in the presence of GTPγS and subsequent irradiation of the membrane-bound ARF resulted in three cross-link products with estimated molecular masses of between 120 and 140 kDa (Fig.1 A, lane 2). The molecular masses of the cross-link products are in the range of several coatomer subunits (reviewed in Ref. 33Harter C. Wieland F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 75-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and therefore we determined whether addition of purified coatomer during the incubation of [35S]ARF-(Tmd)Phe-46 with Golgi membranes would increase the efficiency of cross-linking. As shown in Fig.1 A (lane 5 versus lane 2), a much stronger intensity of the cross-link products is observed under these conditions. In contrast to several nonspecific cross-reactivities, these three bands are strongly reduced in the presence of GDPβS (Fig. 1 A, lane 3) or in the absence of irradiation (Fig. 1 A,lane 4) or in the presence of an excess of wtARF (Fig. 1 A, lane 6). ARF has to be bound to Golgi membranes for the cross-linking to occur, as an incubation in the absence of membranes lead to a complete absence of cross-link products (Fig. 1 A, lane 1).The specific cross-link products are also observed in the presence of high concentrations of bovine brain cytosol (a high speed supernatant from bovine brain homogenate), demonstrating the highly specific interaction between ARF and these proteins (Fig. 1, lanes 7–9). Under these conditions, Golgi membranes were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C with [35S]ARF-(Tmd)Phe-46 before addition of cytosol in order to prevent competition of photolabile ARF1 with ARF1 from cytosol. Surprisingly, another cross-link product of ∼205 kDa appears in the presence of cytosol (Fig. 1, lane 9). Subtracting the molecular mass of ARF, this protein has an apparent molecular mass in the range of about 180–185 kDa. We considered the possibility that under these circumstances, ARF might also interact with clathrin heavy chain (CHC), a protein with similar molecular mass, or with AP180, a clathrin assembly-promoting phosphoprotein, or with subunits of the adaptor protein (AP) complex, all of which are recruited to the membrane to form a clathrin coated vesicle (34Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 999-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 35Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 99-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation with an α-CHC antibody did immunoprecipitate CHC from cytosol but failed to immunoprecipitate this radioactive band (data not shown). Likewise, antibodies against AP180, γ-adaptin (a subunit of the AP-1 complex), and β3B (a subunit of the AP-3 complex) did immunoprecipitate their respective antigen but failed to immunoprecipitate the cross-linked product. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the cross-link occurs at the epitope of the antibody (making it inaccessible for immunoprecipitation), these data make it unlikely that the cross-link-product is due to an interaction of ARF involved in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles.Immunoprecipitation studies in the absence of cytosol confirmed the presence of the cross-link products (∼120–140 kDa) in the coatomer complex (Fig. 1 B). An anti-coatomer antibody that immunoprecipitates native coatomer complex did immunoprecipitate all three cross-link products (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). Coatomer has four subunits (α-, β-, β′-, and γ-COP) with a molecular weight in the range in the cross-link product. Antibodies directed against each of these subunits were used to determine which subunit(s) is bound to ARF-(Tmd)Phe-46 (Fig.1 B, lanes 3–6). To this end, the samples were treated with SDS in order to dissociate coatomer before immunoprecipitation (for details see “Experimental Procedures”). Antibodies against α-COP (lane 3) and β′-COP (lane 5) did not immunoprecipitate the cross-link products, whereas antibodies against β-COP (lane 4) and γ-COP (lane 6) efficiently immunoprecipitated two different cross-link products. The third band might be derived from β-COP, as it is faintly seen with the β-COP antibody (Fig.1 B, lane 4). One possibility is that more than one ARF binds to β-COP under these conditions. Alternatively, it could be that a small fraction of ARF cross-links at a different position within β-COP, affecting its migration.Incubation of [35S]ARF-(Tmd)Phe-49 with isolated CHO Golgi membranes in the presence of GTPγS and subsequent irradiation of the membrane-bound [35S]ARF-(Tmd)Phe-49 gave a relatively complex cross-link pattern (Fig.2 A, lane 4). However, most of these cross-links are unspecific, as they also appear in the presence of GDPβS or in the absence of irradiation (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and3, respectively). Two bands at ∼40 kDa are specific according to these criteria and only appear in the complete incubation (Fig. 2 A, lane 4 versus lanes 2 and 3). These bands are dependent on the orientation of ARF in the membrane as they do not appear without membranes (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). Several potential candidates could be involved in the formation of the cross-link product of ∼40 kDa, including an interaction of ARF with the p24 family of proteins (10Sohn K. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Bremser M. Lottspeich F. Fiedler K. Helms J.B. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 14Stamnes M.A. Craighead M.W. Hoe M.H. Lampen N. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8011-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, antibodies against p23 and p24 did not immunoprecipitate the cross-link products, although they did immunoprecipitate their respective antigens (data not shown). Alternatively, the cross-link products at ∼40 kDa could be due to dimerization of ARF itself. This possibility cannot, of course, be tested by immunoprecipitation with α-ARF antibodies, as they would also immunoprecipitate ARF-(Tmd)Phe-49 together with its cross-link product. Therefore, we added increasing amounts of wtARF to the incubation of ARF-(Tmd)Phe-49 with Golgi membranes and GTPγS (Fig. 2 B). If a cross-link exists with a protein other than ARF, this would be expected to reduce the efficiency of cross-linking as the specific activity of [35S]ARF-(Tmd)Phe-49 is reduced (see Fig. 1 and Ref. 15Zhao L.Y. Helms J.B. Brugger B. Harter C. Martoglio B. Graf R. Brunner J. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4418-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, the efficiency of the cross-linking was increased with increasing amounts of wtARF (Fig.2 B). This strongly suggests that ARF-(Tmd)Phe49 forms a dimer with ARF present on the membranes, because according to the law of mass effect, only in this case an increase of the cross-link signal is expected.Figure 2Photocross-linking of membrane-bound [35S]ARF-(Tmd)Phe-49. A, in vitro translated ARF-(Tmd)Phe49 was incubated in the absence (lane 1) or presence (all other lanes) of Golgi membranes, with GDPβS (lanes 2, 5, and 8) or GTPγS (all other lanes), in the presence (lanes 5–7) or absence (all other lanes) of purified coatomer, or in the presence of ARF-depleted cytosol (lanes 8–10). After incubation, the samples were centrifuged and the membranes were irradiated (except lanes 4 and 8) and membrane-bound material was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) and autoradiography. When no membranes were present during the incubation (lane 1), the complete incubation was irradiated (without prior centrifugation) and was analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Cytosol was added as described in the legend to Fig.1. B, in vitro translated ARF-(Tmd)Phe-49 was bound to CHO Golgi membranes in the presence of GTPγS as described inpanel A (lane 4), in the absence (lane 2) or presence of 5 and 20 μg of purified recombinant myristoylated human ARF1 (lanes 3 and 4, respectively). The incubations were performed and analyzed as described in panel A. C, immunoprecipitation of membrane-bound coatomer and its individual subunits. In vitro translated ARF-(Tmd)Phe49 was bound to CHO Golgi membranes in the presence of GTPγS and coatomer as described in panel A. After irradiation of membrane-bound ARF, the membranes were solubilized in detergent-buffer and the coatomer complex was immunoprecipitated using an anti-β′-COP antibody (lane 2), or the individual coatomer subunits were immunoprecipitated after denaturation of the complex, using anti-α-COP antibody (lane 3), anti-β-COP antibody (lane 4), anti-β′-COP antibody (lane 5), and anti-γ-COP antibody (lane 6). Immunoprecipitation with a preimmune serum is shown in lane 1. Samples were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When ARF-(Tmd)Phe-49 is incubated under standard conditions but in the presence of coatomer, an additional cross-link product appears at ∼120 kDa (Fig. 2 A, lane 7). This band is not observed in the presence of GDPβS or in the absence of irradiation (Fig. 2 A, lane 7 versus lanes 5 and 6). Addition of cytosol to the complete incubation (under conditions as described for ARF(Tmd)Phe-46) also yielded the specific cross-link products at ∼40 kDa and at ∼120 kDa (Fig. 2 A, lane 10 versus lanes 8 and9). The dependence on the presence of coatomer or cytosol for the ∼120-kDa products to appear suggested a cross-linking of ARF-(Tmd)Phe-49 to a coatomer subunit. Indeed, immunoprecipitation of coatomer with an anti-coatomer antibody immunoprecipitated the 120-kDa cross-link product (Fig. 2 C, lane 2). After dissociation with SDS, antibodies against α-COP (lane 3) and β′-COP (lane 5) did not immunoprecipitate of the cross-link product, whereas antibodies against β-COP (lane 4), and, to a much lesser extent, also γ-COP, immunoprecipitated the cross-link product. Interestingly, both with ARF-(Tmd)Phe-46 and with ARF-(Tmd)Phe-49, in fact two bands (migrating at ∼120 and 140 kDa) are immunoprecipitated with the γ-COP antibody (Fig. 1 B,lane 6; Fig. 2 C, lane 6). Whereas the upper band predominates with ARF-(Tmd)Phe-46 (Fig. 1 B), the lower band predominates with ARF-(Tmd)Phe-49 (Fig. 2 C). As the immunoprecipitation of coatomer-subunits after dissociation of the coatomer complex is subunit-specific and no other subunits co-immunoprecipitate (15Zhao L.Y. Helms J.B. Brugger B. Harter C. Martoglio B. Graf R. Brunner J. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4418-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), it is likely that ARF can cross-link to two different positions of γ-COP, affecting its migration by SDS-PAGE. Depending on the location of the photolabile analogue in ARF, one cross-link of γ-COP prevails over the other.ARF-(Tmd)Phe-43 was bound to Golgi membranes under the same conditions as described above for ARF-(Tmd)Phe-46 and ARF-(Tmd)Phe-49, but did not result in any detectable cross-linking to an interacting protein. This does not exclude the possibility that this site is important for interaction with other proteins, as the distance of the interaction partner with the photolabile residue is critical for cross-link efficiency (17Brunner J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 483-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONUsing a site-directed photocross-linking approach, we previously identified a direct interaction between ARF and β-COP (15Zhao L.Y. Helms J.B. Brugger B. Harter C. Martoglio B. Graf R. Brunner J. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4418-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). With the photolabile group at a different positions within the ARF molecule, we now find that ARF also interacts with the γ-subunit of coatomer. Because single amino acids at position 46 as well as position 49 can interact both with β-COP and with γ-COP (Figs. 1 and 2), this implies that these two subunits are close neighbors within the coatomer complex. Several coatomer subcomplexes have previously been described (8Cosson P. Letourneur F. Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 11Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), including a β/γ/ζ subcomplex (9Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). It is important to note, however, that the cross-linking approach used here is qualitative and does not allow a quantitative determination of,e.g., the stoichiometry between ARF and coatomer. The main reason is that, in an aqueous environment, the generated carbene will react predominantly with water molecules, making cross-link yields ≤1% quite typical (38Brunner J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 628-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This high reactivity, however, renders this photoprobe so specific, because a very close proximity of a protein is needed to compete with the ubiquitously abundant water molecules. Under these conditions, it can be calculated (based on the specific activity of [35S]methionine incorporated into in vitrotranslated ARF) that low picogram amounts of coatomer subunits are covalently bound to suppressed ARF, which does not permit quantitation of the amount of coatomer, bound to suppressed ARF (by bandshift on SDS-PAGE).A schematic drawing of how the coatomer complex is bound to Golgi membranes is shown in Fig. 3. This model is based on the following experimental data. (i) The cytoplasmic tail of the p24 family of proteins specifically binds to coatomer (9Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 10Sohn K. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Bremser M. Lottspeich F. Fiedler K. Helms J.B. Wieland F.T. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 751-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This tail contains a diphenylalanine motif and in some instances, like p23, an additional dilysine motif. The diphenylalanine motif sets these proteins apart from ER-resident proteins that contain only the dilysine ER retrieval signal (10Sohn K. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Bremser M. Lottspeich F. Fiedler K. Helms J.B. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 40Fiedler K. Kobayashi T. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6365-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). A single binding site exists within coatomer for both dilysine retrieval motifs and the cytoplasmic domain of p23, and this site resides in γ-COP (13Harter C. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11649-11654Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). (ii) By use of site-directed photocross-linking, we have shown a direct and GTP-dependent interaction of ARF with β-COP, which persists in COPI-coated vesicles and thus is not restricted to the budding process (15Zhao L.Y. Helms J.B. Brugger B. Harter C. Martoglio B. Graf R. Brunner J. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4418-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These interactions indicate a bivalent interaction of coatomer with the Golgi membrane during vesicle formation, i.e. an anchoring of coatomer to Golgi membranes by ARF as well as by the C-terminal tails of the p24 family of proteins. (iii) The results described here demonstrate that ARF interacts with coatomer at the β/γ-COP interface. Thus, γ-COP interacts both with ARF and the p24 family of proteins, indicating that the bivalent interaction occurs in close proximity of one to another. In the absence of ARF, coatomer cannot bind to Golgi membranes (6Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 7Palmer D.J. Helms J.B. Beckers C.J. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12083-12089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore it is tempting to speculate that the initial recruitment of coatomer to Golgi membranes by ARF affects the γ-subunit so that it subsequently allows the C-terminal tail of p24 protein(s) to bind. This binding then would lead to a conformational change of coatomer, leading to polymerization of the complex and subsequent shaping of the membrane to form a bud (41Reinhard C. Harter C. Bremser M. Brügger B. Sohn K. Helms J.G. Wieland F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1224-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The uncoating of COPI-coated vesicles would simply be the reversal of this process: hydrolysis of ARF-bound GTP by a GTPase-activating protein results in uncoating of COPI-coated vesicles (42Tanigawa G. Orci L. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1365-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Thus, hydrolysis of ARF-bound GTP reduces the affinity of coatomer for ARF and ARF dissociates from COPI-coated vesicles. This in turn could reverse the conformational change in γ-COP to reduce the affinity for the p24 family of proteins, resulting in dissociation from transport vesicles of the coatomer complex.Figure 3Bivalent interaction of coatomer with Golgi membranes at the β/γ-COP interface. For details, see “Discussion.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Together with our previous study that shows an interaction of Phe-82 in ARF with β-COP, we have now mapped the interaction site of ARF and coatomer to a surface area of about 400 Å2, typical for protein-protein interactions.

However, the molecular link between PI 3-kinase and these biological responses is still unclear. We have investigated whether targeting of the catalytic p110 subunit of PI 3-kinase to cellular membranes is sufficient and necessary to induce PI 3-kinase dependent signaling responses, characteristic of insulin action. We overexpressed Myc-tagged, membrane-targeted p110 (p110CAAX), and wild-type p110 (p110WT) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. Overexpressed p110CAAX exhibited ∼2-fold increase in basal kinase activity in p110 immunoprecipitates, that further increased to ∼4-fold with insulin. Even at this submaximal PI 3-kinase activity, p110CAAX fully stimulated p70 S6 kinase, Akt, 2-deoxyglucose uptake, and Ras, whereas, p110WT had little or no effect on these downstream effects. Interestingly p110CAAX did not activate MAP kinase, despite its stimulation of p21 ras. Surprisingly, p110CAAX did not increase basal glycogen synthase activity, and inhibited insulin stimulated activity, indicative of cellular resistance to this action of insulin. p110CAAX also inhibited insulin stimulated, but not platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, demonstrating that the p110CAAX induced inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase and insulin signaling is specific, and not due to some toxic or nonspecific effect on the cells. Moreover, p110CAAX stimulated IRS-1 Ser/Thr phosphorylation, and inhibited IRS-1 associated PI 3-kinase activity, without affecting insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that it may play an important role as a negative regulator for insulin signaling. In conclusion, our studies show that membrane-targeted PI 3-kinase can mimic a number of biologic effects normally induced by insulin. In addition, the persistent activation of PI 3-kinase induced by p110CAAX expression leads to desensitization of specific signaling pathways. Interestingly, the state of cellular insulin resistance is not global, in that some of insulin's actions are inhibited, whereas others are intact.

Interestingly, the state of cellular insulin resistance is not global, in that some of insulin's actions are inhibited, whereas others are intact. One of the major physiological functions of insulin is to stimulate glucose transport into insulin-sensitive tissues by eliciting translocation of the major insulin responsive glucose transporter, GLUT4 from an intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane (1Cushman S.W.

A. 1980; 77: 2542-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). However, the signaling events that mediate insulin-stimulated glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation are poorly understood. Binding of insulin to its receptor results in receptor autophosphorylation and activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase, followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of several intermediate proteins, such as, insulin receptor substrates: IRS-1, 2, 3, 4, and the adaptor protein, Shc (3Lavan B.E.

Tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor substrates and the insulin receptor itself, then bind to Src homology 2 (SH2) 1The abbreviations used are: SH2, Src homology domain 2; PI, phosphoinositide; SH3, Src homology domain 3; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3 domain containing proteins, which further propagates downstream signals. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, a dual protein and lipid kinase is one such signaling molecule (6Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar). It consists of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit. Several isoforms of the regulatory subunit, p55α, p55PIK, p85α, p85β, and two isoforms of the catalytic subunit, p110α and p110β, have been identified. The p85 subunit is composed of an NH2-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and two SH2 domains (7Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The SH2 domains flank the region where p110 associates with p85. The SH2 domains interact with phosphotyrosine residues leading to activation of the p110 catalytic subunit. The p110 subunit phosphorylates phosphoinositides at the 3′-position of the inositol ring to generate phosphoinositides 3-P, 3,4-P2, and 3,4,5-P3 (7Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase also phosphorylates proteins on serine/threonine residues (8Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 9Lam K. Carpenter C.L. Ruderman N.B. Friel J.C. Kelly K.L. J. Biol.

J. 1994; 304: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Ras is another signaling protein downstream of IRS-1 and Shc. After insulin stimulation, tyrosine phosphorylated Shc, and IRS-1, to a lesser extent, interact with another SH2 domain containing adaptor protein-Grb2, which is pre-associated with Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that promotes the formation of the active GTP-bound state of Ras (11Sakaue M. Bowtell D. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Stimulated Ras then activates a cascade of protein serine/threonine kinases, which include Raf, MEK, and the MAP kinases. Although PI 3-kinase and Ras appear to be on separate pathways branching from IRS-1, both have been implicated in pathways that mediate the mitogenic actions of insulin, whereas the metabolic effects of insulin are primarily activated by PI 3-kinase dependent steps. Several lines of evidence indicate that activation of PI 3-kinase by insulin is required for GLUT4 translocation. For example, the PI 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY 294002 prevent GLUT4 translocation and stimulation of glucose transport in rat and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (12Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L.

Dominant-negative mutants of the 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase can also inhibit GLUT4 translocation in response to insulin (15Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y.

However, several other observations suggest that, although necessary, PI 3-kinase activation is not sufficient to promote glucose transporter translocation. Indeed, growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) can stimulate PI 3-kinase as efficiently as insulin, but have only a minor effect on GLUT4 translocation (18Isakoff S.J. Taha C.

Similarly, interleukin 4, which induces tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and PI 3-kinase activation, does not stimulate GLUT4 translocation in L6 myoblasts (18Isakoff S.J. Taha C. Rose E. Marcusohn J. Klip A. Skolnik E.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10247-10251Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Furthermore, subcellular fractionation analyses indicates that insulin, unlike other growth factors, stimulates PI 3-kinase activity not only in the plasma membrane fraction but also in the low density microsomal compartment (20Kelly K.L. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4391-4398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Nave B.T. Haigh R.J. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Shepherd P.R. Biochem.

Thus, it appears that insulin-mediated subcompartmentalization of PI 3-kinase may be unique and might be key to the specificity of the effect of insulin on glucose transport. The aim of this study was to determine whether targeting of PI 3-kinase catalytic subunit to membranous structures is sufficient to trigger signaling events downstream of PI 3-kinase. This allows us to directly study PI 3-kinase-regulated cellular processes in the absence of insulin and to determine whether PI 3-kinase activation is sufficient to trigger signaling events specific for insulin. Furthermore, it avoids potential problems associated with the use of PI 3-kinase inhibitors in elucidating the actions of this enzyme. We, and, others have recently demonstrated that increased PI 3-kinase activity induced by expression of a constitutively active p110 subunit (p110*) can induce GLUT4 translocation (25Martin S.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17605-17608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), but it stimulates glucose transport only partially in the absence of insulin (26Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In contrast, our membrane localized form of the p110 subunit of PI 3-kinase resulted in activation of downstream mitogenesis effects in COS-7 cells (27Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Escobedo M.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Since gene transfer in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by conventional methods is inefficient, in the current experiments we utilized, adenovirus-mediated, high efficiency gene transfer procedures (26Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 28Katagiri H. Asano T. Ishihara H. Inukai K. Shibasaki Y. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. J. Biol.

Our studies showed that expression of the membrane-targeted p110 subunit of PI 3-kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes were sufficient to induce PI 3-kinase dependent downstream signaling events, including glucose transport. Porcine insulin was kindly provided by Lilly. Phospho-specific MAP kinase antibody and phospho-specific p70 S6 kinase antibody were from New England Biolabs, Inc. Anti-human S6 kinase and anti-IRS-1 antibody were from Upstate Biotechnology Incorporated (UBI). c-Myc antibody (9E10), Akt antibody (C-20), p110α-CT antibody, H-Ras antibody, and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit, mouse, and goat antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Erk-1 antibody and PY20H were from Transduction. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and fetal calf serum (FCS) were obtained from Life Technologies. All radioisotopes were obtained from NEN Life Science Products Inc. (Boston, MA). XAR-5 film was obtained from Eastman-Kodak (Rochester, NY). All other reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma. 3T3-L1 cells were grown and maintained in DMEM high glucose medium containing 50 units of penicillin/ml, 50 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 10% FCS in a 10% CO2 environment. The cells were allowed to grow 2 days postconfluency, then differentiated as described earlier (29Sharma P.M. Egawa K. Gastafson T.A. Martin J.L. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7386-7397Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Prior to experimentation, the adipocytes were trypsinized and reseeded in the appropriate culture dishes. The Ad-E1A-transformed human embryonic kidney cell line 293 was cultured in DMEM high glucose medium containing 50 units of penicillin/ml, 50 units of streptomycin/ml, and 10% FCS in a 5% CO2 environment. pSG5-p110WT, and pSG5-p110CAAX were obtained as described previously (30Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The 9E10 epitope was inserted at the amino terminus of bovine p110α cDNA, and the CAAX motif (CKCVLS) was inserted at the COOH terminus for pSG5-p110CAAX. To get pAC-p110WT and pAC-p110CAAX, p110WT and p110CAAX DNA digested with BamHI were cloned into pACCMVpLpA (vector containing an ampicillin selection maker), and digested with EcoRI to determine the direction. The recombinant adenoviruses containing the cDNA encoding the p110CAAX or p110WT were isolated by homologous recombination with two plasmids, pACCMVpLpA (31Gluzman Y. Reichl H. Solnick D. Gluzman Y. Viral Vectors. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 187-192Google Scholar) and pJM17 (32McGrory W.J. Bautista D.S. Graham F.L. Virology. 1988; 163: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) as described previously (29Sharma P.M. Egawa K. Gastafson T.A. Martin J.L. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7386-7397Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmids, pAC-p110CAAX or pAC-p110WT, and pJM17 were purified and co-transfected into 293 cells. Since 293 cells were originally derived from adenovirus transformation, the missing E1 gene function of pJM17 is provided in trans. The resulting recombinant viruses containing the p110CAAX or p110WT are denoted as Ad5-p110CAAXor Ad5-p110WT, respectively, and are replication defective (at least in cells lacking the E1 region of adenovirus), but fully infectious. DNA templates for PCR were extracted from the supernatant of the culture medium of the 293 cells that were infected with each plaque isolates/viruses at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 50 plaque-forming units/ml. A multiplex PCR was performed on 1/10 dilution of virus DNA using E1A and E2B region-specific primers (33Zhang W.W. Koch P.E. Roth J.A. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 444-447PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed for the presence of recombinant or wild-type adenovirus. The presence of p110CAAX and p110WT cDNA inserts in the recombinant virus was confirmed by PCR analysis of viral DNA with p110α cDNA specific primers. One clone of each of the recombinant viruses was amplified further in 293 cells. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transduced at a m.o.i. of 1–40 plaque-forming units/cell for 16 h with stocks of either a control recombinant adenovirus (Ad5-CT) containing the cytomegalovirus promoter, pUC 18 polylinker, and a fragment of the SV40 genome, the recombinant adenoviruses Ad5-p110CAAX or Ad5-p110WT. Transduced cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in 10% CO2 and DMEM high glucose medium with 2% heat-inactivated serum, followed by incubation in the starvation media required for the assay. The efficiency of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer was approximately 90% as measured by immunocytochemistry. The survival of the differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes was unaffected by incubation of cells with the different adenovirus constructs since the total cell protein remained the same in infected or uninfected cells. 3T3-L1 adipocytes uninfected or infected with Ad5-p110CAAX, Ad5-p110WT, or Ad5-CT were starved for 16 h in DMEM regular glucose media with 0.05% FCS. The cells were stimulated with 100 ng of insulin/ml for 5–30 min at 37 °C and lysed in a solubilizing buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 units of aprotinin/ml, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm sodium fluoride, pH 7.5, for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates were centrifuged to remove insoluble materials. For Western blot analysis, whole cell lysates (20–80 μg of protein per lane) were denatured by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting in Towbin buffer containing 0.02% SDS and 20% methanol. For immunoblotting, membranes were blocked and probed with specified antibodies. Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked second antibody followed by chemiluminescence detection, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected with Ad5-p110CAAX, Ad5-p110WT, or Ad5-CT at the indicated m.o.i.s for 16 h at 37 °C and grown in medium containing heat-inactivated serum (2%) for 52 h. Serum-starved (16 h) cells were incubated in the absence (basal) or presence of insulin (100 ng/ml) for 10 min, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation (300–500 μg of total protein) with antibodies to p110α-CT, c-Myc (2 μg), or IRS-1 (4 μg) overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were precipitated from the supernatant with protein G plus (Santa Cruz) or protein A and washed as described (34Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The washed immune complexes were incubated with phosphatidylinositol (Avanti) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) for 10 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped with 20 ml of 8 n HCl and 160 ml of CHCl3:methanol (1:1) and centrifuged, and the lower organic phase was removed and applied to a silica gel thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plate (Merck) which had been coated with 1% potassium oxalate. TLC plates were developed in CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O:NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2), dried, and visualized, and quantitated on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The procedure for glucose transport was a modification of the methods described by Klip et al. (35Klip A. Li G. Logan W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: E291-E296PubMed Google Scholar). Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected with Ad5-p110CAAX, Ad5-p110WT, or Ad5-CT at the indicated m.o.i.s for 16 h at 37 °C and grown in medium containing heat-inactivated serum (2%) for 72 h. Serum and glucose-deprived cells were incubated in MEM in the absence (basal) or presence of 100 ng of insulin/ml for 1 h at 37 °C. Glucose uptake was determined in duplicate or triplicate at each point after the addition of 10 μl of substrate (2-[3H]deoxyglucose or l-[3H]glucose; 0.1 μCi, final concentration 0.01 mmol/liter) to provide a concentration at which cell membrane transport is rate-limiting. The value forl-glucose was subtracted to correct each sample for the contributions of diffusion and trapping. Glycogen synthase activity was determined as described previously (36Thomas J.A. Schlender K.K. Larner J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected with Ad5- p110CAAX, Ad5-p110WT, or Ad5-CT at 40 m.o.i. for 16 h at 37 °C and grown in medium containing heat-inactivated serum (2%) for 72 h. The cells were serum and glucose-starved in DMEM no glucose, 0.1% BSA, 2 mm pyruvate medium for 3 h, then stimulated with or without 200 ng of insulin/ml for 30 min in 5 mm glucose containing medium. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline three times, scraped in the buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm potassium fluoride, pH 7.4, and sonicated. After centrifugation, protein concentration was measured. 10 μg of protein was used to determine the ability to stimulate incorporation of [14C]UDP-glucose into glycogen in the presence and absence of glucose 6-phosphate. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected with Ad5-p110CAAX or Ad5-CT at 30 m.o.i. for 16 h at 37 °C and grown in medium containing heat-inactivated serum (2%) for 48 h. Following 24 h serum starvation, the cells were stimulated with or without insulin (100 ng/ml) for 10 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and frozen at −70 °C immediately. Frozen cell pellets were extracted in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) by shaking for 5 min at 4 °C. The resulting cell extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 2 min. The supernatants were divided in half and either 3 μg of the anti-Ras antibody Y13-259 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 3 μg of rat IgG (Cappel) were added. To both samples, goat anti-rat IgG and protein G-agarose were added as well as NaCl, SDS, and deoxycholate to final concentrations of 500 mm, 0.05%, and 0.5%, respectively. The samples were shaken gently for 1 h at 4 °C and then the immunoprecipitates were washed 4 times in RIPA buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% SDS, and 0.5% deoxycholate and 2 times in 20 mmTris-PO4, pH 7.4. The washed immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 30 μl of 5 mm Tris-PO4, pH 7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA (TED buffer), heated to 100 °C for 3 min, cooled on ice, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min. The immunoprecipitates were washed with an additional 15 μl of TED buffer which was combined with the first 30 μl of TED buffer and GTP and GDP were measured as described below. GTP was converted to ATP using NDP kinase and ADP with the ATP measured in the luciferase/luciferin system according to the following reactions, GTP+ADP→NDP kinaseGDP+ATP ATP+luciferin→luciferaseoxyluciferin+AMP+PPi+light REACTION1where PPi is pyrophosphate. This assay is sensitive to 1 fmol of GTP and was performed essentially as described previously (37Scheele J.S. Rhee J.M. Boss G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1097-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). GDP was converted to GTP using pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate with the GTP measured as described above, GDP+phosphoenolpyruvate→Pyruvate kinaseGTP+pyruvate REACTION2Because the final product is again emitted light, this assay is also sensitive to 1 fmol. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and contained in a final volume of 15 μl of 50 mm glycine, pH 7.8, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 8 mm MgSO4, 50 μmphosphoenolpyruvate, 3 milliunits of pyruvate kinase and 5 μl of sample or GDP standard. It should be noted that this assay measures the sum of GTP + GDP; thus, the amount of GTP in the sample must be subtracted from the amount of GTP + GDP to yield the amount of GDP. DNA was measured by a standard fluorescence method using the fluorescent dye bisbenzimidazole and protein was measured by the Bradford method. The amounts of GDP and GTP in the samples are determined from standard curves prepared with each set of samples and the data are expressed as femtomoles of GTP or GDP per microgram of DNA or milligram of protein in the cell lysate. The differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing the membrane-localized p110CAAX and the wild-type p110WT at 40 m.o.i. for 16 h and protein expression was examined 72 h later by Western blotting. Immunoblotting was performed against the Myc-tagged epitope present at the amino terminus of both the recombinant constructs. Specific bands appeared at ∼110 kDa corresponding to the p110CAAX and the p110WT proteins expressed in infected 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig.1, lanes 2 and 3). The level of expression of both the proteins was similar. The membrane-localized p110CAAX and the wild-type p110WToverexpressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with or without insulin for 10 min and the PI 3-kinase activity was measured in anti-Myc and anti-p110α immunoprecipitates. A representative experiment utilizing anti-p110α immunoprecipitates is shown in Fig.2 A and quantitation of data from seven separate experiments is shown in Fig. 2 B, where the PI 3-kinase activity is expressed as percent of the basal activity (observed in unstimulated, Ad5-p110CAAX infected cells). Overexpression of the membrane-localized p110CAAX protein resulted in a ∼2-fold increase in p110 α-associated PI 3-kinase activity when infected at 40 m.o.i. in the absence of insulin (Fig. 2 B). Insulin treatment of these cells further increased PI 3-kinase activity up to 4-fold (Fig. 2 B), whereas, the cells infected at the same m.o.i. with control adenovirus elicited only 2.5-fold increase in PI 3-kinase activity upon insulin stimulation. In contrast, the wild-type p110WT overexpression induced only a modest, but a dose-dependent elevation of the p110 α-associated PI 3-kinase activity in the absence of insulin. Upon insulin treatment, the level of p110 α-associated PI 3-kinase activity increased further, up to 2.5-fold in the p110WT expressing cells, similar to that observed in uninfected or control infected cells. Preincubation with 1 μm wortmannin blocked the p110-associated PI 3-kinase activity in the membrane-localized p110CAAX overexpressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Akt is a serine/threonine kinase downstream of PI 3-kinase which is activated by serine/threonine phosphorylation. (39Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Akt has been implicated as a mediator of several metabolic effects of insulin, including GLUT4 translocation, glucose uptake, and glycogen synthase activation. Therefore, we determined whether PI 3-kinase can activate Akt, using the gel mobility shift assay. Cell lysates from 3T3-L1 adipocytes infected with increasing m.o.i. of the membrane-localized p110CAAX and the wild-type p110WTexpressing adenoviruses, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-Akt antibody (Fig. 3).

Among the latter genes, we identified the gene encoding anti-apoptotic Mcl-1, the Skd3gene, and the WS-3gene, which were previously unknown to be related to mitochondrial function.

These results indicate that identification of genes up-regulated in the skeletal muscle of the Ant1-deficient mouse provides a novel method for identifying mammalian genes required for mitochondrial biogenesis. The mitochondria generate most of the cells' energy via the process oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). 1The abbreviations used are: OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; DD, differential display; nt, nucleotide(s); WS, Werner syndrome; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends OXPHOS is catalyzed by five multi-subunit enzyme complexes (complexes I-V) located within the inner mitochondrial membrane. The protein subunits necessary for oxidative phosphorylation are encoded by both the nuclear and mitochondrial genome. The mitochondrial genome encodes 13 polypeptides involved in oxidative phosphorylation, including seven subunits of complex I (ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4, ND4L, ND5, and ND6), one subunit (cytochrome b) of complex III, three subunits of complex IV (COI, COII, and COIII), and two subunits of complex V (ATPases 6 and 8) along with 22 tRNAs and 2 rRNA subunits necessary for translation of these polypeptides. Transcription of the mtDNA initiates at two sites, yielding polycistronic messages in which regions coding for protein are interspersed by regions coding for tRNA (1Clayton D.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 141: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The mature mRNAs, rRNAs, and tRNAs are released by cleavage. The nuclear genome encodes all of the remaining genes for mitochondrial biogenesis. These include the remaining subunits for OXPHOS; all of the proteins for mitochondrial regulation, transcription, and translation; and all proteins for mitochondrial intermediary metabolism (2Wallace D.C. Lott M.T. Brown M.D. Cuticchia A.J. Chipperfield M.A. Foster P.A. Human Gene Mapping 1995, a Compendium. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD1996: 1280-1331Google Scholar). Mutations in both the mitochondrial DNA and the nuclear DNA have been shown to cause OXPHOS disease. OXPHOS diseases have a highly variable clinical spectrum, showing the progressive defects in tissues most reliant on cellular energy, with central nervous system, skeletal muscle, and heart frequently being affected. Mitochondrial myopathies are characterized pathologically by degeneration of the contractile elements and the proliferation of subsarcolemmal mitochondria, resulting in ragged red muscle fibers as revealed by the modified Gomori-trichrome stain. The proliferation of mitochondria appears to be a common compensatory response to energy deficiency in muscle, whether caused by OXPHOS disease or endurance training in athletes (3Hood D.A.

The induction of the proliferation of mitochondria is a complex task, requiring coordinate regulation of hundreds of genes dispersed between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. The coordinate up-regulation of nuclear and mtDNA OXPHOS gene transcripts has been documented in the skeletal muscle of patients with three mitochondrial DNA mutation diseases: Kearns-Sayre syndrome; myoclonic epilepsy associated with ragged red fibers; and myopathy encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (4Heddi A.

Knock-out mice deficient in ANT1 exhibit many of the hallmarks of human OXPHOS disease, including a defect in coupled respiration, lactic acidosis, exercise intolerance, and a dramatic proliferation of skeletal muscle mitochondria. The dramatic increase in mitochondrial number and volume in the muscle of Ant1-deficient mice suggests that there might be a coordinate up-regulation of genes required for energy production. In an effort to identify the up-regulated genes, we have analyzedAnt1-deficient mouse muscle RNA using differential display RT-PCR technology (7Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar). This has resulted in the identification of 17 genes up-regulated in mutant mouse muscle. Among these are genes known to be involved in OXPHOS, as well as genes previously unknown to be involved in mitochondrial function. Total RNA was isolated from gastrocnemius muscle of two wild type and two Ant1-deficient mice using TRIZOL Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). DNA contamination was removed with the MessageClean kit, and the mRNA was reverse-transcribed and amplified using the differential display RNAimage Kits 1–4 (GenHunter Corporation, Nashville, TN). The resulting 33P-labeled RT-PCR products were run on 6% LongRanger polyacrylamide gels. Putative differentially regulated bands were cut from the gel, eluted, and reamplified. Differential display (DD) products were identified by the direct sequencing of reamplified products (8Buess M. Moroni C. Hirsch H.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2233-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) using the ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) and the ABI 377 DNA sequencer. The resulting sequence information was compared with GenBankTM and EST data bases at the National Center for Biomedical Information via the BLAST computer program. Northern hybridization analysis was performed using glyoxal and Me2SO to denature 10 μg of total RNA, followed by electrophoresis and transfer to Hybond N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To verify the differential expression of the genes identified by differential display, DD products were cloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and the resulting cDNAs were used as probes for Northern and reverse Northern hybridization. First, Northern blot strips that contained only skeletal muscle RNA were probed with the corresponding cloned and reamplified DD product. If this Northern blot showed up-regulation of the gene of interest, then RNA samples from the tissues containing various ratios ofAnt1/Ant2 mRNA (skeletal muscle, heart, and brain) were blotted and probed with the corresponding cloned and reamplified DD product. Probes for evaluation of mitchondrial DNA transcripts were created by amplification of nt 3351–7570 and nt 8861–14549 of the mitochondrial DNA from mouse genomic DNA using mitochondrial DNA specific primers. The Rediprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to label probes with [α-32P]dCTP. The intensity of bands was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For reverse Northern blots, DD PCR products were immobilized on membrane and hybridized to probe synthesized by reverse transcription of RNA from either wild type or Ant1-deficient mice. One μg of each DD PCR product was applied to duplicate Hybond N membranes via a dot blot apparatus (Millipore). Probes were made by reverse transcription of 20 μg of total RNA derived from gastrocnemius muscle of either wild type or Ant1-deficient mice using the ReversePrime kit (GenHunter Corporation). The 5′ ends of cDNAs identified by differential display were isolated using the RACE technique. Template for amplification was mouse skeletal muscle Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Gene-specific primers designed from the differential display product sequence were combined with linker-specific primers of the cDNA and the Advantage cDNA polymerase mix (CLONTECH), and the 5′ end of the gene was amplified. The products were sequenced directly using the ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer) and analyzed using an ABI 377 DNA sequencer. The products were also cloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen). DD RT-PCR techniques (7Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar) were used to identify genes up-regulated in Ant1 −/− mice. Total RNA from the gastrocnemius muscle of a 3-month-old littermateAnt1 +/+ and −/− mice was extracted, reverse transcribed, and subjected to differential display PCR using various arbitrary primers (exemplified in Fig.1). Using 96 primer pairs that displayed approximately 7,500 cDNA PCR products, 84 PCR products were initially identified as differentially expressed. These DD products were then reamplified, sequenced, and cloned into a plasmid vector. Seventeen genes were verified as up-regulated in the Ant1knock-out mouse, and they fell into four categories: 1) nuclear and mitochondrial genes encoding OXPHOS components, 2) mitochondrial tRNA and rRNA genes, 3) other genes involved in intermediary metabolism, and 4) an eclectic group of other genes. The sequences of ten of the DD products (TableI) revealed genes encoding subunits of the electron transport chain. Six of these are mitochondrially encoded and include the complex I subunit genes ND1, -2, -4, -5, -6, and the complex IV subunit gene COI (Fig. 2). Northern analysis revealed that all six of these mRNAs, and three others tested (ND4L, COII, and COIII) were up-regulated in the skeletal muscle of the ANT1-deficient mice (Fig.3). All mitochondrial mRNAs tested were up-regulated between 2.5–3.5-fold. Similar increases are seen for patients with mitochondrial myopathies (4Heddi A. Lestienne P. Wallace D.C. Stepien G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12156-12163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IIdentity of up-regulated differential display productsDD BandOriginIdentityFunctionDD2mtDNAND4NADH dehydrogenase subunitDD4NuclearCI-B18Ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunitDD7NuclearCoxVbCytochromec oxidase subunitDD21NuclearMGPGlycogen phosphorylaseDD24NuclearSkd3UnknownDD25NuclearWS-3UnknownDD26NuclearMcl1Anti-apoptoticDD40mtDNAND6NADH dehydrogenase subunitDD44NuclearCI-B8Ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunitDD46mtDNACOICytochrome c oxidase subunitDD57mtDNA16 S RNAMitochondrial protein synthesisDD60NuclearCoxVaCytochromec oxidase subunitDD62mtDNAND2NADH dehydrogenase subunitDD63mtDNAtRNAPolycistronic transcriptDD65mtDNAND1NADH dehydrogenase subunitDD67NuclearMor2Malate dehydrogenaseDD69mtDNAND5NADH dehydrogenase subunit Open table in a new tab Figure 3Northern blot analysis of mtDNA derived transcripts.

Probes (mtDNA probes 1 and 2) used for evaluation of mitchondrial transcripts were created by amplification of nt 3351–7570 and nt 8861–14549 of the mitochondrial DNA from mouse genomic DNA using mitochondrial DNA specific primers and were labeled by random primer extension with [α-32P]dCTP. A probe hybridizing to 18 S RNA was used to control for RNA loading levels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The remaining four up-regulated OXPHOS transcripts are derived from the nuclear DNA and encode components of complexes I and IV. The complex IV subunit genes encode two subunits of cytochrome c oxidase, COXVa (9Nielsen P.J. Ayane M. Kohler G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6723Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and COXVb (10Basu A. Avadhani N.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1087: 98-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The complex I subunits are homologues of the bovine genes encoding CI-B8 and the 18-kDa Fe-S protein (11Walker J.E. Arizmendi J.M. Dupuis A. Fearnley I.M. Finel M. Medd S.M. Pilkington S.J. Runswick M.J. Skehel J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1051-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Because these genes had not been cloned from mouse, RACE was used to isolate, clone, and sequence the mouse CI-B8 and CI-18k genes (GenBankTM accession numbers AF124786 and AF124785, respectively). Northern blots of all four of these subunits has confirmed that they are up-regulated in theAnt1 −/− skeletal muscle (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Two of the DD RT-PCR products were identified by sequence analysis to correspond to mtDNA genes encoding structural RNAs, the mitochondrial 16 S rRNA (DD57) and a cluster of three tRNAs encompassed in nucleotides 4821–5171 (DD65). The differential display product DD65 contains the 3′ end of ND1, in addition to the three contiguous tRNA genes. The association in one RNA of these continuous genes suggests that this is a processing intermediate of the polycistronic H-strand transcript. Sequence analysis of two differential display products revealed that they encode the intermediary metabolism proteins malate dehydrogenase and glycogen phosphorylase. The sequence of DD67 is identical to the 3′ region of the mouse gene for the mitochondrial isoform of malate dehydrogenase (12Joh T. Takeshima H. Tsuzuki T. Setoyama C. Shimada K. Tanase S. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. Morino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15127-15131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Malate dehydrogenase catalyzes the final reaction of the citric acid cycle, the regeneration of oxaloacetate. The sequence of DD21 reveals that it is the mouse homologue of the gene for the rat muscle isozyme of glycogen phosphorylase (13Hudson J.W. Hefferon K.L. Crerar M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1164: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Glycogen phosphorylase catalyzes the breakdown of glycogen to yield glucose-1-phosphate. The mouse homologue of the glycogen phosphorylase gene was isolated by RACE (GenBankTM accession number AF124787). The RNA levels of both malate dehydrogenase and glycogen phosphorylase genes were shown to be up-regulated in Ant1 knock-out mice (Fig.5). Skd3. Northern blots probed with DD product DD24 revealed that this message is up-regulated in both heart and skeletal muscle of theAnt1 −/− mice (Fig.6 A). The DNA sequence of DD24 is identical to the previously cloned gene Skd3.Skd3 was isolated from a mouse cDNA library based on its ability to suppress the growth defect of a yeast K+transporter mutant (14Perier F. Radeke C.M. Raab-Graham K.F. Vandenberg C.A. Gene. 1995; 152: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The predicted Skd3 gene product is a 76-kDa protein consisting of a C-terminal domain with 57–64% similarity with members of the Clp/HSP104 family of proteins (Fig.5 B). SKD3, unlike other members of the Clp/HSP104 family, contains four ankyrin-like repeats in its N-terminal domain. SKD3 also contains a hydrophilic region at its amino-terminal that is predicted by the computer program PSORT (15Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar) to target the protein to the mitochondrion (Fig. 6 B). The sequence of DD product DD25 proved to be identical to several mouse expressed sequence tags and homologous to the humanWS-3 gene. WS-3 was cloned and characterized in humans by virtue of its proximity to the gene responsible for Werner syndrome (WS) (16Ichikawa K. Yamabe Y. Imamura O. Kuromitsu J. Sugawara K. Suzuki N. Shimamoto A. Matsumoto T. Tokutake Y. Kitao S. Kataoka H. Satoh M. Sugimoto M. Goto M. Sugawara M. Furuichi Y. Gene. 1997; 189: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mouse WS-3 (DD25) was shown by Northern blot analysis to be up-regulated in the skeletal muscle of theAnt1 knock-out mouse (Fig. 5 B). The putativeWS-3 gene product is a 20.7-kDa hydrophilic protein of unknown function. However, BLAST searches performed with theWS-3 predicted protein sequence reveal a similarity to the third enzyme in the enterbacterial lipid A biosynthesis pathway (17Hirvas L. Koski P. Vaara M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,18Kelly T.M. Stachula S.A. Raetz C.R. Anderson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19866-19874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse homologue of human WS-3 was isolated by RACE (GenBankTM accession number AF124788). The sequence of the DD26 product is identical to the 3′ end of the Mcl1 gene. Mcl-1, a member of Bcl-2 family of anti-apoptotic proteins, is located at least partially in the mitochondrion (19Yang T. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Northern analysis verified that Mcl1 is up-regulated in the skeletal muscle of mice deficient in ANT1 (Fig. 5). In addition to being up-regulated in the ANT1 knock-out mouse,Mcl1 mRNA also appears to have an altered mobility on Northern blots. In the absence of the adenine nucleotide translocator, ATP synthesized in the mitochondrion is not transported into the cytoplasm, and an energy deficient state is created. The cell recognizes this deficiency, and sends an as yet unidentified signal to the nucleus to increase transcription of mitochondrial genes. Accordingly, most of the genes shown to be up-regulated in Ant1 −/− mice should encode products directly involved in the synthesis of ATP, including components of the mitochondrial energy generating apparatus, such as the electron transport chain and the citric acid cycle, machinery for mitochondrial biogenesis, including the mitochondrial rRNAs and tRNAs, and functionally related proteins such as glycogen phosphorylase and malate dehydrogenase. Previous studies2 have shown that human glycogen phosphorylase mRNA is up-regulated in mitochondrial myopathy patients and that the gene contains a 5′ REBOX binding site. The 8-base pair REBOX sequence motif was identified as a specific protein binding site in Ant1 and ATP synthetase β subunit promoters by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (20Chung A.B. Stepien G. Haraguchi Y. Li K. Wallace D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21154-21161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This binding is sensitive to NADH and thyroxine, suggesting that it may modulate OXPHOS gene expression in response to environmental and hormonal changes (20Chung A.B. Stepien G. Haraguchi Y. Li K. Wallace D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21154-21161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several of the genes shown to be up-regulated are not likely to be directly involved in ATP synthesis. Up-regulation of Mcl-1, a Bcl-2 homologue, is more likely a response to oxidative stress in the cell.Mcl1 has been shown to be up-regulated in response to reactive oxygen species (21Yang T. Buchan H.L. Townsend K.J. Craig R.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), which have shown to be at higher levels in Ant1 −/−mice. 3L. A. Esposito and D. C. Wallace, unpublished results. The finding thatMcl1 is up-regulated in this animal model for mitochondrial myopathy suggests that apoptosis plays a role in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial mutations in human patients. By analogy with the other genes found to be up-regulated, we propose that WS-3 and Skd3 are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. BLAST searches performed with the predicted WS-3 protein reveal a similarity to the third enzyme in enterbacterial lipid A biosynthesis (17Hirvas L. Koski P. Vaara M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18Kelly T.M. Stachula S.A. Raetz C.R. Anderson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19866-19874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because mitochondria are believed to have originated by endosymbiosis of bacteria, and several important mitochondrial proteins such as DNA polymerase γ (1Clayton D.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 141: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) have greater similarity to bacterial proteins than eukaryotic proteins, it seems possible that this WS-3 plays a role in mitochondrial lipid synthesis. This hypothesis is strengthened by comparison with the model of the two families of fatty acid biosynthesis enzymes. In addition to the previously known eukaryotic (type I) cytosolic enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis, bacterial homologues of these enzymes (type II) have been discovered in various eukaryotic species (22Schneider R. Brors B. Massow M. Weiss H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Some of these enzymes have been localized to the mitochondria, and deletion of the corresponding gene leads to defects in respiratory function. It is possible that prokaryotic type genes involved in lipid synthesis have also been retained from the endosymbiotic ancestor of the mitochondrion and that WS-3 is one of these genes. BecauseAnt1 −/− mice have a dramatic proliferation of mitochondria, enzymes involved in mitochondrial lipid synthesis would be expected to be up-regulated in these mice. Skd3 encodes a predicted protein with a putative mitochondrial targeting signal, ankyrin-like repeats, and similarity to the Clp/HSP104 family of proteins. Interestingly, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp78, another member of the Clp/HSP104 family, appears to cooperate with the mitochondrial matrix protein Hsp70 in maintenance of mitochondrial function (23Moczko M. Schonfisch B. Voos W. Pfanner N. Rassow J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, Hsp78 is responsible for compartment-specific thermotolerance in yeast (5Schmitt M. Neupert W. Langer T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). SKD3, unlike other members of the Clp/HSP104 family, contains four ankyrin-like repeats in its N-terminal domain. In erythrocytes, ankyrin is responsible for attachment of spectrin to integral membrane proteins, whereas in nonerythroid cells, ankyrin is thought to be involved in protein/protein or protein/cytoskeleton interactions. Because of these sequence motifs, we hypothesize that the SKD3 protein is localized to the mitochondria, where it may interact with an unknown protein and assist in the assembly of some multi-subunit complex. In this work, we have identified 17 genes up-regulated in theAnt1 −/− mice by DD RT-PCR. Interestingly, 33 other differential display products isolated have been identified by sequence, but their relative expression cannot be assessed by filter hybridization techniques, because they are of very low abundance in muscle (data not shown). Six mRNAs, one tRNA, and one rRNA encoded by the mitochondrial genome were identified as differentially expressed by differential display. Because all mitochondrial mRNAs appear to be up-regulated, differential display methods identified half of all up-regulated transcripts from the mitochondrial genome. By extrapolation to the nuclear genome, the 17 mRNAs with levels high enough to be identified as up-regulated, and the 33 genes with low level expression identified by differential display, should represent a significant proportion of the genes up-regulated inAnt1-deficient mice. We conclude that differential expression methods provide an effective means to identify genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Experiments using complementary differential expression methods, such as serial analysis of gene expression, are in progress. We acknowledge the contribution of Brett H. Graham."

The double-stranded form of this sequence serves as a binding site for a transcription enhancer factor 1-related protein while the separated single strands interact with two distinct DNA binding activities termed VACssBF1 and 2 (Cogan, J. G., Sun, S., Stoflet, E. S., Schmidt, L. J., Getz, M. J., and Strauch, A. R. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 11310–11321; Sun, S., Stoflet, E. S., Cogan, J. G., Strauch, A. R., and Getz, M. J. (1995) Mol. Cell. Biol. 15, 2429–2936). VACssBF2 has been recently cloned and shown to consist of two closely related proteins, Purα and Purβ (Kelm, R. J., Elder, P. K., Strauch, A. R., and Getz, M. J. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 26727–26733). In this study, we demonstrate that Purα and Purβ interact with each other via highly specific protein-protein interactions and bind to the purine-rich strand of the MCAT enhancer in the form of both homo- and heteromeric complexes. Moreover, both Pur proteins interact with MSY1, a VACssBF1-like protein cloned by virtue of its affinity for the pyrimidine-rich strand of the enhancer. Interactions between Purα, Purβ, and MSY1 do not require the participation of DNA. Combinatorial interactions between these three single-stranded DNA-binding proteins may be important in regulating activity of the smooth muscle α-actin MCAT enhancer in fibroblasts.

Eukaryotic gene transcription requires the coordinated assembly of upstream cis-element binding proteins, intermediary cofactors, and components of the basal transcription machinery into a multicomponent complex competent to initiate transcription. During this process, sequence-specific DNA-binding transcriptional activators and/or repressors play a pivotal role in modulating the cell-type specific expression of genes. While most such proteins bind to double-stranded DNA target sequences, a small but intriguing subclass has been identified that show enhanced affinity and specificity for either the sense or antisense strands of certaincis-regulatory elements required for promoter-specific activation (1Duncan R.

Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26727-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The involvement of ssDNA-binding proteins in VSM α-actin gene transcription was discovered as a consequence of promoter mapping studies that led to the identification of a conserved 5′-flanking sequence required for both activation and repression of promoter activity in fibroblasts and undifferentiated myoblasts (11Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Cogan J.G. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2429-2436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Cogan J.G. Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. J. Biol.

This proximal promoter element (PE) sequence (−195 to −165) exhibited polypurine-polypyrimidine asymmetry, an inverted muscle-specific MCAT (AGGAATG) enhancer element, and bound at least three distinct DNA binding activities in a sequence and strand-specific manner. The two ssDNA binding activities, formerly designated vasculara ctin single-strandbinding factors, VACssBF 1 and 2, appeared to play a role in repression (11Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Cogan J.G. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2429-2436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) while a transcription enhancer factor 1-related protein was implicated in activation (12Cogan J.G. Sun S.

Korf G.M. Foster D.N. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of repression remains to be formally established, a hypothetical model involving VACssBF-mediated disruption of MCAT element base pairing and competition for transcription enhancer factor 1 binding was proposed (11Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Cogan J.G. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2429-2436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, an additional binding site for VACssBF2 was later identified on the purine-rich coding strand of a GGAATG-containing sequence element located in a downstream VSM α-actin exon (14Kelm Jr., R.J. Sun S. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24278-24285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This coding element sequence functioned as a VACssBF2-dependent repressing element when positioned 5′ and adjacent to a transcription enhancer factor 1- or activator protein 1-dependent enhancer element in chimeric promoter constructs (14Kelm Jr., R.J. Sun S. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24278-24285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because the noncoding strand of the coding element sequence lacked detectable VACssBF1 binding affinity (14Kelm Jr., R.J. Sun S. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24278-24285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), these data suggested that VACssBF2 binding was necessary and sufficient for repression. Screening of a mouse lung cDNA expression library with the exonic VACssBF2-binding site ultimately resulted in the isolation of two clones encoding the purine-rich ssDNA-binding proteins, Purα and Purβ (10Kelm Jr., R.J.

Biochemical analyses of the cloned mouse Pur proteins expressed in fibroblasts confirmed that Purα and Purβ corresponded to the p46 and p44 components of VACssBF2 that bind to the purine-rich strand of the PE and presumably down-regulate VSM α-actin gene expression (10Kelm Jr., R.J. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26727-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used a similar binding site screen to confirm the identity between VACssBF1 and the mouse Y-box protein, MSY1. By utilizing recombinant proteins and isoform-specific immune reagents, we demonstrate highly specific protein-protein interactions between Purα, Purβ, and MSY1 which seem likely to have functional significance. These include the binding of Pur proteins to ssDNA as both homo- and heterodimeric complexes and the formation of heterotrimeric complexes between all three proteins in the absence of DNA. These data suggest that protein-protein interactions between Purα, Purβ, and MSY1 play an important role in regulating transcriptional activity of the VSM α-actin gene in fibroblasts. A mouse lung cDNA expression library (Stratagene) was screened for cDNA-encoded proteins that interact with the pyrimidine-rich strand of the VSM α-actin MCAT enhancer element using a binding site cloning methodology described previously (10Kelm Jr., R.J. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26727-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Eight independent clones were isolated from 250,000 plaques initially screened. DNA sequencing by semi-automated dideoxy termination indicated that all eight clones encoded the mouse Y-box protein, MSY1 (15Tafuri S.R. Familari M. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12213-12220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding the open reading frame minus the start methionine of mouse Purα, Purβ (10Kelm Jr., R.J. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26727-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and MSY1 (clone 7-1, this study) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers which generated 5′ BamHI and 3′KpnI cloning sites. The polymerase chain reaction products were gel purified, cut with restriction enzymes, and subcloned into pQE-30 (Qiagen) to generate fusion constructs encoding a N-terminal 6xHis tag. The resultant plasmids were transformed intoEscherichia coli strain JM109 and the orientation and fidelity of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA inserts were determined by DNA sequencing. For protein preparation, 1 liter of terrific broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated (1:50) with an overnight bacterial culture and incubated for 5–7 h at 37 °C. Recombinant protein synthesis was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 2.0 mmand an additional 4-h growth period. E. coli were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 14 ml of cold 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl (lysis buffer) supplemented with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 μg/ml each pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin. Cells were lysed by sequential 30-min incubations on ice with lysozyme added to 1.0 mg/ml followed by Triton X-100 added to 0.13% (v/v). Lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatants were collected, combined with 4 ml of packed Ni-NTA agarose resin (Qiagen) equilibrated in lysis buffer, and mixed overnight at 4 °C. The resin was washed sequentially at room temperature with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, buffer containing 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0 mNaCl. The resin was then packed into a column and washed with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 2.0 m NaCl, pH 8.0, until the A 280 nm of the flow-through was ≤0.02. His-tagged protein was eluted with a step gradient of 50 mmphosphate, 2.0 m NaCl containing 20, 40, 80, and 500 mm imidazole. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue R-250 staining. Pur protein or MSY1-enriched fractions were pooled, dialyzed versus 50 mm sodium phosphate, 1.0 m NaCl, pH 8.0, and chromatographed a second time on Ni-NTA agarose to ensure optimal purity. His-tagged protein eluates were dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8, aliquoted, and stored at −20° C. Recombinant proteins were also purified as above but in buffers supplemented with 8 m urea. Purification under such conditions enhanced the yield of His-tagged protein. No differences were observed in the in vitro protein-binding properties between His-tagged proteins purified under nondenaturing or denaturing conditions after dilution and/or dialysis into aqueous buffer. Recombinant protein concentration was estimated by optical density measurement using molar extinction coefficients and molecular weights of 18,610 and 35,000 for Purα, 18,610 and 34,000 for Purβ, and 26,170 and 36,000 for MSY1. In some cases, proteins were quantified by dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Peptides corresponding to amino acids 42–69, 210–229 and 302–324 of mouse Purβ (10Kelm Jr., R.J. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol.

The composition of each peptide was confirmed by amino acid analysis. Each peptide was synthesized with a cysteine residue at either the N or C terminus to facilitate coupling to maleimide-activated KLH (Pierce) and iodoacetyl-agarose (Sulfolink, Pierce). KLH-coupled peptides were used as immunogens and rabbit polyclonal antisera production was carried out by a commercial vendor (Cocalico) using a 60-day standard protocol. Polyclonal rabbit IgGs were affinity purified using peptide-coupled agarose columns. Briefly, whole IgG was enriched from rabbit antisera by 40% ammonium sulfate precipitation. Following centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 × g, the IgG-rich pellet was reprecipitated, dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, and dialyzed. Rabbit IgG was then applied to the appropriate 2-ml peptide-agarose (0.5–1.0 mg of peptide/ml) column equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. The flow-through fraction was collected and reapplied. After washing the column with phosphate-buffered saline, peptide-bound IgG was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, and immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 9.5. Affinity purified IgG was precipitated by the addition of solid ammonium sulfate to 75% saturation. The pellet was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 50% (v/v) glycerol/phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −20° C. Rabbit IgG from pooled preimmune serum was purified on Protein A/G-agarose (Calbiochem). IgG concentration was estimated by optical density measurement based upon a molar extinction coefficient and molecular weight of 210,000 and 150,000, respectively. His-tagged mouse Purα, Purβ, or MSY1 diluted to 50 nm in 25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 (HBS), containing 5.0 μg/ml crystalline grade bovine serum albumin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), was applied to polystyrene microtiter wells (100 μl/well) (Corning ELISA plate number 25805) and incubated 16–20 h at 4° C. The resultant Purα-, Purβ-, or MSY1-coated wells were washed once with HBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (HBST), and blocked for 1 h with 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in HBS (250 μl/well). Wells were washed once and rabbit anti-mouse Pur or MSY1 peptide antibody (1.0–0.016 μg/ml, 100 μl/well) diluted in HBST containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin was applied for 2 h at room temperature. Primary antibody solution was aspirated and wells were washed three times with HBST. Goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz) diluted 1:2000 in HBST was then applied for 1 h. Wells were washed as above and 100 μl of ABTS chromogenic substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added. Absorbance readings at 405 nm were determined after 5–6 min using a 96-well microplate spectrophotometer. Cellular Purα, Purβ, or MSY1 were enriched from 1 mg of AKR-2B fibroblast nuclear protein by selective capture on biotinylated-ssDNA (PE-F for Pur proteins and PE-R for MSY1) coupled streptavidin-paramagnetic particles as described previously (10Kelm Jr., R.J.

DNA-bound proteins were eluted with 1% SDS, resolved on a 10% (29:1) polyacrylamide mini-curtain gel, and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P) for 90 min (300 mA) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol at 4° C. After blocking overnight in 25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 (TBS), with 5% (w/v) Carnation nonfat dry milk at 4° C, the membrane was fitted into a multiscreen apparatus (Mini-PROTEAN II, Bio-Rad) and selected channels were loaded with 0.6 ml of rabbit anti-Pur or MSY1 peptide antibody diluted to 2.0, 0.5, and 0.1 μg/ml in 2% nonfat dry milk/TBS. Following a 1-h incubation at ambient temperature with gentle mixing, the antibody solutions were aspirated, and each channel was washed once with TBS, containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). The initial wash solution was aspirated, the apparatus disassembled, and the entire blot washed three more times (5 min/25-ml wash). Goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz) diluted 1:2000 in TBST was then applied for 1 h. The blot was washed four times (30 min total) and chemiluminescence reagent (ECL, Amersham) was applied for 1 min. Immune complexes were visualized on x-ray film (XAR-5, Kodak) following a 5–10-s exposure. Band shift assays were performed as described previously (11Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Cogan J.G. Strauch A.R.

A 32P-ssDNA probe corresponding to the purine-rich coding strand of the PE was then added (∼1 nm final) and mixtures were incubated for an additional 20 min prior to electrophoresis on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. His-tagged Purβ, MSY1, or dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)-coated microtiter wells (50 nm application as described above) were incubated with varying amounts of AKR-2B nuclear protein (10Kelm Jr., R.J.

Secondary antibody solution was aspirated and wells were washed four times with HBST. Immune complexes were detected using 100 μl of ABTS chromogenic substrate. Absorbance readings at 405 nm were determined after 45 min. Mouse AKR-2B fibroblasts were transiently transfected with mouse Purα and Purβ expression vectors as described previously (10Kelm Jr., R.J.

All subsequent steps including cell synchronization, serum-stimulation, harvest, extraction, and protein assay have been detailed previously (10Kelm Jr., R.J. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J.

Whole cell protein extract (100 μg) from transfected cells or nuclear extract from nontransfected rapidly growing AKR-2B fibroblasts (10Kelm Jr., R.J. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol.

After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, ∼107 sheep anti-rabbit IgG-coupled magnetic dynabeads (Dynal) were added and the mixtures incubated for an additional 90 min. In some experiments, goat anti-rabbit IgG-biotin (Santa Cruz) coupled to streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads (Promega) were used. The beads were then captured with a magnet and washed three times with HBS. Rabbit IgG-bound protein was specifically eluted by adding a vast excess of free peptide (20 μl at 50 μm) and incubating for 30 min at room temperature. Eluates were supplemented with Laemmli SDS sample preparation buffer and 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% (29:1) polyacrylamide mini-gel. Immunoprecipitates were evaluated for the presence Pur proteins and MSY1 via immunoblotting as described above. A repertoire of immune reagents based upon cDNA-deduced amino acid sequences of Purα and Purβ were produced to assist in defining determinants of protein-DNA and putative protein-protein interactions. Synthetic peptides corresponding to both conserved and unique sequences within the Pur proteins were used as immunogens in rabbits (Fig. 1). IgGs were enriched from rabbit antisera and then subjected to affinity purification using peptide-coupled agarose columns. The resultant affinity purified IgGs were tested for reactivity using both recombinant (His-tagged) and cellular Purα and Purβ (Figs.2 and 3). Assessment of antibody binding to immobilized recombinant Purα and Purβ by ELISA (Fig. 2) indicated that several antibodies possessed remarkable specificity for either Purα (anti-A291–313) or Purβ (anti-B210–229 and anti-B302–324) while another antibody directed against a conserved region (anti-B42–69) cross-reacted with Purα and Purβ (Fig. 2). The specificity of these antibodies was also evaluated by Western blotting of cellular Pur proteins enriched from an AKR-2B fibroblast nuclear extract by selective capture on paramagnetic particles coupled with the purine-rich strand of the VSM α-actin MCAT element, PE-PrMss, or PE-F (10Kelm Jr., R.J. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26727-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Consistent with ELISA data, anti-B42–69 demonstrated similar reactivity toward fibroblast-derived Purα (p46, M r ∼ 46,000) and Purβ (p44,M r ∼ 44,000) which migrate as a closely spaced doublet (Fig. 3, lanes 4–6). Anti-A291–313 recognized only the slower migrating Purα (p46) isoform (Fig. 3, lanes 16–18) while both anti-B210–229 and anti-B302–324 preferentially detected the faster migrating Purβ (p44) isoform (Fig.3, lanes 10–12 and 13–15). As expected, preimmune rabbit IgG failed to detect the Pur proteins in both screening assays.Figure 2Screening of rabbit anti-Pur peptide IgGs against recombinant Pur proteins.

Initial experiments utilized nuclear protein from AKR-2B fibroblasts as a source of cellular Purα and Purβ and a32P-oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the purine-rich coding strand of the PE (PE-PrMss or PE-F) (11Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Cogan J.G. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2429-2436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in earlier studies, Purα and Purβ -ssDNA complexes migrate as a closely spaced doublet (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). A slower migrating complex (NS) that is also detected is composed of an unrelated, nonspecific DNA-binding protein (11Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Cogan J.G. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2429-2436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kelm Jr., R.J. Sun S. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol.

As illustrated in Fig. 4 A, three out of the four anti-Pur antibodies tested (lanes 4–6) were found to selectively supershift the two major Pur protein-ssDNA complexes into two slower migrating complexes, designated SS1 and SS2. These supershifted complexes were not formed when preimmune IgG or anti-B42–69 were included in the reaction mixtures (lanes 2 and 3). The inability of anti-B42–69 to supershift suggests that this antibody is unable to bind Pur proteins in their native (i.e. nondenatured) state since immobilization on polystyrene (Fig. 2) or denaturation by SDS (Fig. 3) did not interfere with epitope recognition. Closer inspection of the band shift patterns obtained using isoform-specific antibodies provided unexpected results. While anti-A291–313 appeared to only partially supershift the major Purα-ssDNA complex (Fig. 4 A, lane 6, arrow), a minor and slower migrating complex (denoted by a *) was completely supershifted by this antibody. Moreover, anti-B210–229 and anti-B302–324 clearly supershifted the most rapidly migrating Purβ complex and, surprisingly, the major (middle) Purα-containing complex as well (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4 and 5). These data suggested that the major (middle) Purα complex is heterogeneous and likely contains Purβ while the minor, slowest migrating complex is composed exclusively of Purα. Owing to the low abundance of this minor Purα-containing complex, we also performed antibody supershift analyses using extracts from AKR-2B fibroblasts transfected with mouse Purα and/or Purβ expression vectors (10Kelm Jr., R.J.

https://openalex.org/W1995030412,"Recent studies have highlighted the existence of discrete microdomains at the cell surface that are distinct from caveolae. The function of these microdomains remains unknown. However, recent evidence suggests that they may participate in a subset of transmembrane signaling events. In hematopoietic cells, these low density Triton-insoluble (LDTI) microdomains (also called caveolae-related domains) are dramatically enriched in signaling molecules, such as cell surface receptors (CD4 and CD55), Src family tyrosine kinases (Lyn, Lck, Hck, and Fyn), heterotrimeric G proteins, and gangliosides (GM1 and GM3). Human T lymphocytes have become a well established model system for studying the process of phorbol ester-induced down-regulation of CD4. Here, we present evidence that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced down-regulation of the cell surface pool of CD4 occurs within the LDTI microdomains of T cells. Localization of CD4 in LDTI microdomains was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy. PMA-induced disruption of the CD4-Lck complex was rapid (within 5 min), and this disruption occurred within LDTI microdomains. Because PMA is an activator of protein kinase C (PKC), we next evaluated the possible roles of different PKC isoforms in this process. Our results indicate that PMA induced the rapid translocation of cytosolic PKCs to LDTI microdomains. We identified PKCα as the major isoform involved in this translocation event. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that LDTI microdomains represent a functionally important plasma membrane compartment in T cells.

Treatment of T cells with phorbol esters such as PMA is one of the methods used to mimic modulation of CD4 that occurs during the antigen encounter (12Acres B.R. Conlon P.J. Mochizuki D.Y. Gallis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16210-16214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon activation, cytoplasmatic serine residues of CD4 are phosphorylated most likely via an isoform or isoforms of PKC (13Veillette A. Bookman M.A. Horak E.M. Bolen J.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar,14Alexander D.R. Cantrell D.A. Immunol. Today. 1989; 10: 200-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). PKCs are a family of at least 12 isoenzymes, whose 8 isotypes (α, β1, β2, δ, ε, ζ, η, and θ) are expressed in T cells (15Lucas S. Marais R. Graves J.D. Alexander D. Parker P.J. Cantrell D.A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Mischak H. Kolch W. Goodnight J. Davidson W.F. Rapp U. Rose-John S. Mushinsky J.F. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3981-3987PubMed Google Scholar) and are responsible for CD4 down-modulation by endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits (17Pelchen-Matthews A. Parson I.J. Marsh M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1209-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In this regard, CD4 lacking intracellular serine residues (a possible target for PKC phosphorylation) is not down-regulated by phorbol esters (18Shin J. Doyle C. Yang Z. Kappes D. Strominger J.L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 19Doyle C. Shin J. Dunbrack R.L. Strominger J.L. Immunol. Rev. 1989; 109: 17-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). CD4 expression returns to normal only upon prolonged PMA stimulation, which exhausts cytoplasmic stores of PKC (20Hoxie J.A. Matthews D.M. Callahan K.J. Cassel D.L. Cooper R.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 1194-1201PubMed Google Scholar). PKCs differ in substrate specificity, cofactor requirements, tissue and cellular distributions, subcellular localizations (21Hoessli D.C. Rungger-Brandle E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), and regulatory mechanisms (22Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) that lead to their differential translocation in the cell following stimulation (23Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). In T lymphocytes, PMA activation induces PKCα, β1, and β2 redistribution from a diffusely cytoplasmic localization to a discrete focal distribution around the plasma membrane and nucleus (24Berry N. Ase K. Kikkawa U. Kishimoto A. Nishizuka Y. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1407-1413PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known about the specific role played by each of the multiple isoforms present in a given cell type, although the involvement of PKCθ in T cell activation following stimulation by antigen presenting cells has been recently described. In this regard PKCθ was spatially restricted to the site of contact, where receptors on the T cells encounter their counterparts on antigen presenting cells (25Monks C.R.F. Kupfer H. Tamir I. Barlow A. Kupfer A. Nature. 1997; 385: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of a given PKC isoform may represent an important clue in determining the specific function of a given PKC isoform. Electron microscopy and plasma membrane fractionation in the absence of detergent have demonstrated that the PKCα isoform is enriched with caveolae (26Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 27Smart E.J. Ying YS Mineo C. Anderson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The co-existence in the same cell of caveolae and membrane “rafts” enriched in glycolipids has been described (28Parton R.G. Simons K. Science. 1995; 269: 1398-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 29Liu J. Oh P. Horner T. Rogers R.A. Schnitzer J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) as well as membrane rafts in cells devoid of morphologically recognizable caveolae such as neuronal and hematopoietic cells (2Parolini I. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. Peschle C. Blood. 1996; 87: 3783-3794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16374-16381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). These rafts have also been termed LDTI or “caveolae-related domains.” We recently purified and characterized these low density Triton-insoluble (LDTI) microdomains from hematopoietic cells. These LDTI microdomains morphologically and biochemically resemble raft domains and were highly enriched in signal transducing molecules such as a subset of cell surface receptors, Src family tyrosine kinases, heterotrimeric G proteins, and gangliosides (GM3) (2Parolini I. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. Peschle C. Blood. 1996; 87: 3783-3794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,4Sorice M. Parolini I. Sansolini T. Garofalo T. Dolo V. Sargiacomo M. Tai T. Peschle C. Torrisi M.R. Pavan A. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 969-980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). New insights into the dynamic clustering of raft domains have highlighted their potential role as a starting point for many membrane-linked processes, including certain transmembrane signaling events (30Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). However, in the hematopoietic system, the exact function of these domains has not yet been established. To address this issue, we have analyzed the well described process of CD4 internalization in human T cells that is induced by activation with PMA. Here, we show that this process takes place within LDTI microdomains. More specifically, we demonstrate that upon PMA treatment (i) the CD4-Lck complex is disrupted within LDTI domains; (ii) CD4 shifts from LDTI domains to a Triton-soluble particulate fraction in a time-dependent manner, whereas Lck remains within the LDTI domain; and (iii) many PKC isoforms are activated and translocated from the cytosol to LDTI domains but at different rates. In addition, PKCα appears to be the most abundant isoform within LDTI domains, suggesting that it plays an important role in this process. Anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody used for Western blotting was purchased from Novocastra (Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK). Anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody used for immunoprecipitation was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). For FACS analysis and immunoelectron microscopy anti-CD4, OKT4 was purchased from Ortho Diagnostic System (Raritan, NJ). Anti-Lck, anti-PKCβ1, β2, δ, ε, and η polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies; anti-Fyn, anti-PKCα, and anti-PKCθ monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories, Inc. (Lexington, KY); anti-PKCζ was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Anti-monoclonal or -polyclonal secondary antibodies horseradish peroxidase-conjugated were purchased from Bio-Rad. Biotin-NHS was purchased from Calbiochem, and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugated was from Pierce. Gö 6976 and Gö 6850 were obtained from Calbiochem. PKCα purified enzyme was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). PMA and Histone H1, Type IIIS, were obtained from Sigma. Anti-Gi antibody was a generous gift of Dr. Tommaso Costa. An established protocol was followed to prepare total cell membranes (or particulate), enriched in plasma membrane, from human peripheral lymphocytes, with some modifications (65Lehel C. Olah Z. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Anderson W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4761-4766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 109 lymphocytes were surface labeled by incubation with biotin-NHS (0.5 mg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing with ice-cold serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then with PBS, cells were incubated with PMA (100 ng/ml) at 37 °C for the indicated times in warm RPMI medium. After three washes with ice-cold PBS, cells were Dounce-homogenized with 2 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8,0, 2 mm EGTA containing 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). The homogenate was first centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and then the supernatant was centrifuged at 2,000 ×g for 5 min to remove nuclear debris. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 60,000 rpm for 30 min to produce a nucleus-free membrane fraction (pellet) and a cytosol fraction (supernatant). Proteins were quantified by Peterson method (33Peterson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 95-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) and then resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a 0.22-μm nitrocellulose filter (Amersham Life Science, Buckinghamshire, UK), and blocked with 4% nonfat milk and 1% BSA in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0,05% Tween 20). The membrane was then probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugated at 1:30,000 dilution in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed six times with TBST and incubated with SuperSignal chemiluminescence ULTRA (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactive proteins were detected by autoradiography on Kodak T-Mat G/RA film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). LDTI complexes were isolated as described previously (2Parolini I. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. Peschle C. Blood. 1996; 87: 3783-3794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z.L. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 109 lymphocytes were washed and lysed in 1 ml of MBS (25 mm MES, pH 6, 5, 150 mm NaCl) or were treated as described to recover membrane fractions (M). Next both preparations were Dounce homogenized in buffer containing 0, 0.02, 0.1, or 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, adjusted to 40% sucrose, and placed at the bottom of four different ultracentrifuge tubes. A 5–30% linear sucrose gradient was then placed above the lysate, and the mixture was centrifuged at 45,000 RPM, 16 h, 4 °C in a SW60 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). In both cases LDTI, visible as a band migrating at approximately 20% sucrose, was harvested and washed twice with MBS at 14,000 RPM for 30 min at 4 °C and then protein quantitated. 1 × 109 lymphocytes consisting of 50 mg of total protein, yielded a mean of 7 mg of particulate fractions, and 110 μg of LDTI fractions. Thus LDTI represents 0.2% of the initial homogenate and 1.5% of membrane fraction, whereas membrane represents 14% of the initial homogenate. LDTI, total cell lysates or total membrane proteins were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose filter. The blots were blocked using 5% nonfat milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with anti-Lck polyclonal (dilution 1:100), anti-Fyn monoclonal (dilution 1:400), anti-Gi polyclonal (dilution 1:2000), anti CD4 monoclonal (dilution 1:200) or anti-PKC-specific antibodies in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. PKCα was 1:4000 diluted, PKCθ was 1:250 diluted, and the other PKC isoforms were 1:100 diluted. After washing with TBST, each filter was incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugated at 1:3000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Reactive proteins were detected as described above. For immunoprecipitation experiments LDTI domains or membrane fraction from biotin-labeled lymphocytes were prepared as described above. 1–5 μg of protein were precleared with 30 μl of a 50% slurry protein A/G-agarose (Pierce) and 1 μg of nonimmune serum in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) for 1 h at 4 °C. CD4 antibody (0.5 μg/ml) or PKCα (1 μg/ml) or PKCδ (1 μg/ml) were then added to the sample and kept overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with prewashed beads (40 μl), 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were spun down and washed four times with lysis buffer, resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer under reducing conditions, boiled, and spun down. The supernatant was loaded on a 8% SDS-PAGE. Cell surface CD4 was detected by blotting the filter with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugated under the conditions described for detection of surface proteins. Using this procedure only one band corresponding to 55-kDa CD4 was detectable. 1 μg of LDTI complexes isolated from PMA-treated cells were resuspended in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2) supplemented with Gö 6976 (10−7m) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (2×) under reducing conditions. The mixture was boiled, separated on 10% SDS-PAGE that was then dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR film. In other experiments, to test the activity of PKCα, 5 μg of Histone type IIIS and 25 ng of PKCα purified enzyme were incubated with 10 μg of phospatidylserine in ADB buffer (1 mm sodium ortovanadate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2), prior to the addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. CD4+ lymphocytes (1 × 106 in 1 ml of PBS) were incubated with PMA as reported above. PMA-treated and untreated cells were then fixed with acetone/methanol 1:1 (v/v) for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were soaked in Hank's balanced salt solution for 30 min at 25 °C and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C in the blocking buffer of 2% BSA in PBS containing 5% glycerol and 0.2% Tween 20. Cells were then labeled with anti-PKCα, δ, or ε polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. After three washes in PBS, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing three times in PBS, pH 7.4, cells were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-Lck monoclonal antibody, followed by 3 washes in PBS and the addition (30 min at 4 °C) of goat anti-mouse IgG (γ-chain-specific) conjugated with Texas Red (Calbiochem Biochem). Cells were finally washed three times in PBS and then mounted upside down onto a glass slide in 5 ml of glycerol/Tris-HCl, pH 9.2. The coverslips were sealed with nail varnish to prevent evaporation and stored at 4 °C before imaging. The images were acquired through a confocal laser scanning microscope (Sarastro 2000, Molecular Dynamics) equipped with a NIKON OPTIPHOT microscope (objective 60/1.4 oil) and an Argon Ion Laser (25 mW output). Simultaneously, the green (FITC) and the red (Texas Red, which reduces greatly overlapping) fluorophores were excited at 488 and 518 nm. Acquisition of single FITC-stained samples in dual fluorescence scanning configuration did not show contribution of green signal in red. Images were collected at 512 × 512 pixels (0.08 μm/pixel lateral dimension, 0.48 μm/pixel axial dimension). Serial optical sections were assembled in Depth-Coding (Molecular Dynamics) mode. Acquisition and processing were carried out using Image Space software (Molecular Dynamics). CD4 expression on untreated and PMA-treated lymphocytes was investigated using monoclonal antibody CD4 (OKT4) fluorescein conjugated (1:20 in PBS, 1% BSA for 30 min at 4 °C). After washing with PBS/BSA cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in PBS. Green fluorescence intensity was analyzed with FACS scan cytometer (Becton Dickinson). For every histogram 5000 cells were counted to evaluate the percentage of CD4+ cells. The percentage of surface expression at different times of incubation with PMA was calculated using the mean fluorescence divided by the mean fluorescence at time 0 minus the background fluorescence. To assess CD4 localization at the cell plasma membrane of Triton-treated cells we followed a previously reported protocol with some modifications (35Moldovan N.I. Heltianu C. Dimionescu N. Simionescu M. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, CD4+ cells were isolated from peripheral lymphocytes using the IsoCellTM human CD4 Isolation Kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instruction. CD4+ cells were then incubated with monoclonal antibody (OKT4) at 1:5 dilution in 0.5 ml of PBS/BSA for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by two washes with ice-cold PBS. Cells were resuspended with 1 ml of paraformaldehyde 3% in PBS, pH 7.2 for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing, cells were left untreated or 1% Triton X-100-treated for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by a second incubation with monoclonal antibody (OKT4) for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) (1:10 in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C), cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde (1% in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C), extensively washed, and then labeled with colloidal gold (18 nm, prepared by the citrate method) conjugated with protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3 h at 4 °C. Control experiments were performed omitting the incubation with OKT4 monoclonal antibody in both untreated and 1% Triton X-100-treated lymphocytes. All samples were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in Veronal acetate buffer, pH 7.4, for 2 h at 4 °C, stained with uranyl acetate (5 mg/ml), dehydrated in acetone, and embedded in Epon 812. Mophometric analysis of the length of plasma membrane in Triton X-100-treated cells and in untreated controls as well as quantification of colloidal gold granules were performed on 30 micrographs printed at the same magnification. The results were expressed as the means ± S.D. The detergent insolubility of caveolae and caveolae-related domains is based on their high content of cholesterol and sphingolipids; many distinct classes of lipid-modified signaling molecules are retained within these detergent-resistant membrane domains. However, certain caveolae- and caveolin-1-associated proteins are dissociated from these domains as a consequence of detergent treatment; these include receptor tyrosine kinases (such as epidermal growth factor receptor) and a variety of prenylated proteins (such as Ha-Ras) (36Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). In addition, a small amount of caveolin-1 is found in the Triton-soluble fraction, and this fraction of caveolin-1 is associated with the Golgi complex (37Kishore K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). More interestingly, recent evidence indicates that proteins can move in and out of caveolae-related domains, depending on their activations state and that this dynamic movement can be monitored by changes in Triton solubility and partitioning into low density Triton-insoluble domains (LDTI, a biochemically descriptive term for caveolae-related domains) (38Montixi C. Langlet C. Bernard A.M. Thimonier J. Dubois C. Wurbel M.A. Chauvin J.P. Pierres M. He H.T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5334-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). In a previous report, we demonstrated that CD4 is dramatically enriched within these LDTI domains in human lymphocytes (4Sorice M. Parolini I. Sansolini T. Garofalo T. Dolo V. Sargiacomo M. Tai T. Peschle C. Torrisi M.R. Pavan A. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 969-980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we analyze the changes in CD4 localization after cell activation by phorbol esters (PMA). To study changes in CD4 localization following phorbol ester cell activation, we first analyzed the Triton sensitivity of CD4 in resting lymphocytes. Thus, we experimentally defined the optimal Triton X-100 concentration that is required for the isolation of Triton-insoluble CD4 from the bulk of soluble plasma membrane proteins (Fig.1 a). To this end, ∼ 1 × 109 lymphocytes were surface labeled with sulfo-NHS-biotin. Two mg of the cell membrane fraction (M) were prepared from these labeled lymphocytes and homogenized with increasing amounts of Triton X-100, followed by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation. Each tube was then divided into twelve 375-μl fractions, and 10 μl/fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotting with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. Only biotin-labeled cell surface proteins were detected by this procedure (Fig. 1 a,left).Figure 1Characterization and enrichment of CD4 in LDTI of resting lymphocytes. a, a total membrane fraction obtained from 1 × 109 surface biotinylated lymphocytes was homogenized in a buffer containing: 0, 0.02, 0.1, or 1% Triton X-100 as indicated and subjected to sucrose gradient density centrifugation. An aliquot of each fraction (10 μl) was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Fraction 1 corresponds to the top of the gradient. Biotinylated proteins were visualized by blotting with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. Particulate material from each fraction was also collected by centrifugation, resuspend in 30 μl, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody direct against CD4. Inset, 3 μg of fraction 5 obtained from 1% Triton gradient was immunoprecipitated with 0.5 μg of anti-CD4 IgG and subjected to SDS-PAGE and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase blotting. For comparison, 10 μl from fraction 5 of the same gradient was analyzed as in parallel. b, 1 × 109 lymphocytes were used to prepare a particulate total membrane fraction, homogenized in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Twelve fractions of equal volume were collected, and their protein content was determined. The protein profile is expressed as a percentage of the total particulate loaded (2 mg). The distribution of CD4 was obtained by densitometric analysis of CD4 immunoblots. c andd, CD4 analysis in cell fractionation representing sequential steps of CD4 enrichment, starting from total cell lysate.T, total cell lysate; M, total membrane fraction (or particulate). c, values were derived from densitometry of band intensity relative to the total cell lysate (total lysate value = 1). CD4 fold enrichment was determined by the amounts used for normalized CD4 expression/relative fraction protein content (which is expressed as a percentage of the total protein). M andLDTI represent 15 and 0.2% of total protein, respectively.d, same CD4 band intensity was obtained with 50 μg of total lysate, 5 μg of total membranes, and 1 μg of the LDTI microdomains.

As previously reported, coligation of CTLA-4 mAb results in suppression of T cell proliferation and cytokine production. The proliferation but not the interleukin 2 (IL-2) production could be restored by addition of exogenous IL-2, suggesting that the inhibitory effect occurred at the level of IL-2 production rather than at the regulation of the IL-2 receptor pathway. To study the effects on nuclear factors critical for T cell activation, we analyzed the levels of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1. These were potently induced in CD3/CD28 mAb-restimulated T cells. In contrast, CTLA-4 ligation strongly suppressed the induction of both transcription factors. The compositions of NF-κB and AP-1 family members were similar, irrespective of stimulation conditions. Analyses of the NF-κB regulator IκB-α revealed similar levels of IκB-α protein in the preparations. However, a reduced phosphorylation of IκB-α in CTLA-4 coengaged T cell blasts compared with T cells ligated with CD3/CD28 was found. Previous studies have concluded that CTLA-4 ligation regulates T cell activation by inhibiting the T cell receptor-mediated signals.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 233-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar). CTLA-4 was originally thought to have a similar function as CD28. In agreement with this original thought, B7-dependent costimulation of CD28-deficient T cells has been demonstrated, which suggests that CTLA-4 ligation results in costimulation (4Wu Y. Guo Y. Huang A. Zheng P. Liu Y. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1327-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, there is accumulating data showing that CTLA-4 coligation has a negative regulatory effect on T cells, such as down-regulation of interleukin 2 (IL-2) production and cell cycle progression (5Krummel M.F. Allison J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar, 6Walunas T.L. Bakker C.Y. Bluestone J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2541-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). This negative regulatory effect is supported not only by the phenotype of CTLA-4-deficient mice (7Waterhouse P. Penninger J.M.

The IL-2 gene is regulated by signals mediated by TCR as well as CD28 signaling that ultimately leads to DNA binding of nuclear factors such as the prominent NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors (12Rincon M. Flavell R.A. EMBO. J. 1994; 13: 4370-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). After TCR stimulation, the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs within the TCR/CD3ζ chain interact with intracellular signaling molecules. The tyrosine residues within immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs become phosphorylated and create binding sites for Src homology-containing proteins (13Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The activation of these protein-tyrosine kinases results in phosphorylation of downstream substrates, e.g. p21 ras/mitogen-activated protein kinases, phospholipase Cγ1 and Vav (13Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 14Ward S.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The TCR·CD3ζ complex alone cannot stimulate proliferation, despite the activation of several downstream pathways. The CD28 receptor provides additional signals, including activation of p21 ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, phospholipase Cγ1, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (14Ward S.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This activation is attributable to tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD28 cytoplasmic domain after CD28 cross-linking. CD28·TCR signaling causes IκB-α phosphorylation, whereupon the IκB-α is degraded, and the IκB-α·NF-κB complex is resolved, allowing translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus (15Ghosh S. May M. Kopp E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar, 16Baldwin Jr., A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). Moreover, the mitogen-activated protein kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) are activated on signaling and induce c-Fos and c-Jun transcription and the following formation of AP-1 protein complexes (12Rincon M. Flavell R.A. EMBO. J. 1994; 13: 4370-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Although the downstream consequences of CTLA-4 signaling are still unclear, two distinct models have been proposed to explain the inhibitory activity of CTLA-4 (17Fallarino F. Fields P.E. Gajewski T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The first model suggests that CTLA-4 antagonizes CD28 function, either by competing for B7 binding (2Perkins D. Wang Z. Donovan C. He H. Mark D. Guan G. Wang Y. Walunas T. Bluestone J. Listman J. Finn P.W. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4154-4159PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kariv I. Truneh A. Sweet R.W. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 29-38PubMed Google Scholar, 19Greene J.L. Leytze G.M. Emswiler J. Peach R. Bajorath J. Cosand W. Linsley P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26762-26771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and/or actively blocking CD28 signal transduction (5Krummel M.F. Allison J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar, 6Walunas T.L. Bakker C.Y. Bluestone J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2541-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar,20Calvo C.R. Amsen D. Kruisbeek A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1645-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The second model suggests that CTLA-4 interferes with TCR signaling. An effect on TCR signaling was recently proposed because of identification of hyperactive kinases associated with TCR observed in CTLA-4-deficient T cells (21Marengere L.E. Waterhouse P. Duncan G.S. Mittrucker H.W. Feng G.S. Mak T.W. Science. 1996; 272: 1170-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), suggesting that CTLA-4 counteracts the hyperphosphorylation in a normal situation. Two recent studies using CD28-deficient mice found that CTLA-4 in the absence of CD28 antagonized the TCR-mediated signal, arguing that it is sufficient to explain the inhibitory effect of CTLA-4 (17Fallarino F. Fields P.E. Gajewski T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 22Lin H. Rathmell J.C. Gray G.S. Thompson C.B. Leiden J.M. Alegre M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A recent study using preactivated T cells showed that CTLA-4 selectively inhibited TCR induced ERK-2 activity and TCR·CD28-induced JNK activity (20Calvo C.R. Amsen D. Kruisbeek A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1645-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an intracellular activation motif in the CTLA-4 cytoplasmic domain has been identified, which shows homology to the CD28 cytoplasmic tail (24Leung H.T. Bradshaw J. Cleaveland J.S. Linsley P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25107-25114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 25Prasad K.V. Cai Y.C. Raab M. Duckworth B. Cantley L. Shoelson S.E. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2834-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This common domain has been shown to be the binding site for p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; however controversy regarding its role in costimulation exists (26Cefai D. Schneider H. Matangkasombut O. Kang H. Brody J. Rudd C.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2223-2230PubMed Google Scholar,27Hutchcroft J.E. Bierer B.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4071-4074PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the effect of CTLA-4 coligation on nuclear transcription factors in mouse CD4+ T cell blasts. We found that CTLA-4 ligation had profound effects on the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1. Moreover, the effects of CTLA-4 ligation were only evident when CD28 was also coligated, supporting the hypothesis that the major function of CTLA-4 is suppression of CD28 signaling. RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 0.01 m HEPES, 1 mm NaHCO3, 0.1 mg/ml gentamicin sulfate, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol was used throughout for cell cultures. UC10-4F10-11 (hamster IgG anti-murine CTLA-4) hybridoma was a kind gift from Dr. J. Bluestone (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL). Anti-CTLA-4 mAbs were produced from the hybridoma and purified on a protein G column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hamster anti-mouse CD3 (145-2C11), CD28-PE and unconjugated (37.51) CTLA-4-PE (UC10-4F10-11), hamster IgG-PE/unconjugated (G235-2356, isotype control), and rat anti-mouse CD4-PE/fluorescein isothiocyanate (GK1.5) were purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Spleens from 8–12-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (H-2b) purchased from M & B (Ry, Denmark) were used as a source of CD4+ T cells. Erythrocytes were depleted from spleen cells by hypotonic lysis, and the remaining cells were cultured in the presence of soluble anti-CD3 mAb (0.5 μg/ml). After 48 h, the cells were harvested and live cells were enriched by density centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The enrichment procedure was followed by positive selection using magnetic beads coated with anti-CD4 mAb (Miltenyi Biotec, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the manufacturer's descriptions. The purity of the CD4+ T cells (≥96%) was routinely checked by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses. Although not separated by size, they are denoted as T cell blasts throughout this paper for simplicity. Latex beads (Interfacial Dynamics Corp., Portland, Oregon) were coated with mAbs toward CD3, CD3/CD28; CD3/CTLA-4; CD3/CD28/CTLA-4; or hamster IgG (isotype control) as described by Krummel and Allison (5Krummel M.F. Allison J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar). The concentrations of mAbs used for coating were anti-CD3, 0.5 μg/ml; anti-CD28, 1 μg/ml; and anti-CTLA-4, 4.5 μg/ml. The total amount of mAb was compensated for by adding control mAb (trinitrophenol-specific hamster IgG) to a final Ig concentration of 6 μg/ml. One hundred thousand CD4+ T cell blasts were cocultured with 105 coated beads in round-bottom 96-well plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). After 24 h of restimulation, the cells were pulsed for 4 h with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine, and the amount of incorporated [3H]TdR was determined by liquid scintillation counting (28Olsson C. Michaelsson E. Parra E. Pettersson U. Lando P.A. Dohlsten M. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The amount of IL-2 was quantified by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using specific Ab pairs from PharMingen (JES6-1A12 and JES6-5H4) and recombinant murine IL-2 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The amount of IFN-γ was quantified by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant murine IFN-γ and specific Ab pairs from PharMingen (R4-6A2 and XMG1.2). Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extracts were prepared, with minor modifications, according to the method described by Schreiber et al. (29Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Aliquots of protein were stored at −70 °C until required, and protein concentrations of extracts were measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. [γ-32P]ATP-labeled probes (30,000 cpm) were prepared as described previously (30Sundstedt A. Sigvardsson M. Leanderson T. Hedlund G. Kalland T. Dohlsten M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used contained the following sequences: AP-1 consensus, 5′-CTAGTGATGAGTCAGCCGGATC-3′; NF-κB consensus, 5′-GATCGAGGGGACTTTCCCTAGC-3′; and Oct binding site, 5′-CGTCTCATGCGATGCAAATCACTTGAGATC-3′ (31Jain J. Miner Z. Rao A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 837-848PubMed Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed with the same amount of protein in each mixture (0.5–2 μg), and the samples were electrophoresed on a 6.5% polyacrylamide-Tris borate-EDTA gel as described previously (30Sundstedt A. Sigvardsson M. Leanderson T. Hedlund G. Kalland T. Dohlsten M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For supershift analyses, the mixture of nuclear protein extract and labeled oligonucleotide was incubated with 1 μg of Abs against various transcription factors for 1 h on ice. Polyclonal Abs directed to Rel family proteins p50 (sc-114), p65 (sc-372), c-Rel (sc-70), and c-Rel (sc-272, pan-c-Rel) and to AP-1 gene family proteins c-Jun/AP-1 (sc-44, pan-Jun), c-Jun/AP-1 (sc-45), Jun B (sc-046), Jun D (sc-74), c-Fos (sc-253), c-Fos (sc-052), Fra-1 (sc-183), and Fra-2 (sc-171) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The cytoplasmic protein extracts were analyzed for content of total as well as phosphorylated IκB-α protein by Western blotting. Protein extracts were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Sundbyberg, Sweden). Phosphorylated IκB-α and total IκB-α protein were analyzed with the PhosphoPlus IκB-α antibody kit according to the instructions from the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). C57BL/6 spleen cells were prestimulated for various time points, after which the expression of both CD28 and CTLA-4 was analyzed by FACS. CD28 was expressed on nonstimulated CD4+ T cells, but no CTLA-4 was detectable on the surface (Fig. 1 A). After 48 h of stimulation the CD4+ T cells contained higher levels of CD28 (Fig. 1 B), expressed the activation marker IL-2 receptor α (IL-2Rα) (data not shown), and 40–60% of the activated CD4+/CD28+ T cells also expressed CTLA-4 (Fig.1 B). To study the role of CTLA-4 on activated T cells, we stimulated T cell blasts expressing CTLA-4 as described by Krummel and Allison (5Krummel M.F. Allison J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar). We chose not to rest the T cell blasts before stimulation, because we noted that this caused a rapid down-regulation of surface CTLA-4 (data not shown). After stimulation with mAbs toward CD3/CD28, the T cell blasts produced considerable amounts of IL-2 and IFN-γ and were shown to proliferate (Fig. 2). On the contrary, when CTLA-4 was coligated, T cell blasts did not produce IL-2 or proliferate, and IFN-γ production was reduced to the level observed for blasts restimulated with anti-CD3 only (Fig. 2). In cultures restimulated with control mAb only, none of the cytokines analyzed could be detected. The effects of CTLA-4 ligation on IL-2 production was also apparent at the mRNA level. At 40 and 90 min after restimulation, T cell blasts restimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 showed a marked up-regulation of IL-2 mRNA, whereas the mRNA levels in T cell blasts restimulated with coligated CTLA-4 were comparable with the nonstimulated T cell blasts. Similar glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase levels were detected in all samples (data not shown).Figure 2CTLA-4 coligation down-regulates T cell immune response. Bulk spleen cells from C57BL/6 mice were stimulated with soluble anti-CD3 for 48 h, whereafter the CD4+ T cell blasts were collected by positive selection by magnetic cell separation. T cell blasts were then stimulated with the indicated mAb immobilized on beads. A, IL-2; B, IFN-γ production; C, proliferation as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation after 24 h of stimulation. Shown is one representative experiment of three similar performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) T cell blast proliferation, but not the IL-2 production, could be restored by the addition of recombinant human IL-2 in cultures stimulated with coligated CTLA-4 (Fig. 2, A andC). Because the IL-2Rα expression was only slightly influenced by CTLA-4 coligation, this suggested that the influence of CTLA-4 was at the level of IL-2 protein production rather than regulation of the IL-2R pathway. These results are in agreement with others (6Walunas T.L. Bakker C.Y. Bluestone J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2541-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 32Finn P.W. He H. Wang Y. Wan Z. Guan G. Listman J. Perkins D.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4074-4081PubMed Google Scholar). We further dissected the impact of CTLA-4 ligation on intracellular signaling events by studying NF-κB and AP-1 binding activity in nuclear protein preparations from restimulated CD4+ T cell blasts. Nuclear protein extracts were analyzed using gel shift analysis and oligonucleotides encoding an NF-κB or an AP-1 consensus motif. The protein preparations from T cell blasts, restimulated with anti-CD3 mAb only, produced a weak signal of NF-κB and AP-1 binding activity (Fig. 3). The inclusion of CD28 mAb led to a substantial increase in both NF-κB and AP-1 binding activity, whereas the concomitant presence of CTLA-4 brought the NF-κB and AP-1 binding activity down to levels seen in T cell blasts restimulated with anti-CD3 mAb only (Fig. 3). Interestingly, there was no effect of CTLA-4 ligation in the absence of CD28 ligation, suggesting that CTLA-4 mainly inhibited CD28 and not the CD3 signaling. Thus, the observed abrogated IL-2 production in CTLA-4-ligated T cells (Fig. 2 A) correlated with markedly reduced amounts of NF-κB and AP-1 DNA binding activity. We also analyzed DNA binding of the ubiquitous octamer binding proteins. Constitutive expression of two complexes, which most likely corresponded to Oct-1 and Oct-2, was seen in all nuclear extracts irrespective of stimulation conditions (Fig. 3). The NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors are composed of homo- or heterodimers of p50, p65, and c-Rel, whereas the AP-1 transcription factors are homo- or heterodimers of different members of the Fos (e.g. c-Fos, Fra-1, and Fra-2) and Jun (e.g. c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) family of proteins. Supershift analyses with Abs to a panel of different Rel, Fos, and Jun family proteins were used to determine whether the CTLA-4 inhibitory effect was attributable to differences in compositions of the prominent transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1. Because our findings propose that the major impact of CTLA-4 ligation is inhibition of signals mediated by CD28, we focused on studying T cell blasts stimulated with CD3/CD28 in the presence or absence of coligated CTLA-4. The components of the Rel family of transcription factors revealed two complexes binding to the NF-κB element. The main constituent in T cell blasts stimulated with either mAb combination was a faster-migrating p50-p50 homodimer (Fig.4 A). Addition of Ab against p65 to nuclear protein preparations stimulated with either mAb combination reduced the upper complex, which indicated participation of p65 in the NF-κB·Rel complex. Because the upper complex was also shifted by Ab against p50, it is reasonable to assume that it represents a p50-p65 heterodimer. Also, supershift analyses of AP-1 components revealed a similar pattern irrespective of stimulation protocols, with the major Jun component present being Jun D. The AP-1 complex was reduced in intensity when Ab against Fra-2 was added, indicating the participation of Fra-2 components in the AP-1 complexes (Fig. 4 B). No shifts were observed with control IgG (data not shown). Control experiments performed with a mixture of Abs and DNA probe in the absence of protein extract showed that none of the Abs used bound directly to the DNA target sequences (data not shown). Because a similar composition of either NF-κB/Rel or AP-1 family members appeared in the absence or presence of CTLA-4 coligation, it appears that CTLA-4-mediated down-regulation of T cell activation was attributable to interference with CD28 signal transduction rather than interference with a specific nuclear factor. NF-κB is present in the cytoplasm bound to the IκB-α protein; IκB-α retains NF-κB in the cytoplasm by masking the nuclear localization signal (16Baldwin Jr., A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 33Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IκB-α at serines 32 and 36 leads to the release and nuclear translocation of active NF-κB/Rel transcription factors (16Baldwin Jr., A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 33Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar) and represents the major regulatory step in NF-κB activation. Examination of cytoplasmic protein extracts by Western blot revealed that CD3/CD28 and CD3/CD28/CTLA-4 coligated T cell blasts contained similar levels of total IκB-α protein (Fig.5 A). Blotting with phosphospecific IκB-α Ab showed that CD4+ T cell blasts activated with CD3/CD28 mainly contained the slower-migrating phosphorylated form of IκB-α (Fig. 5 B), which suggested that the majority of NF-κB has been translocated into the nucleus and is active in transcriptional events. Interestingly, cytoplasmic protein extracts from CTLA-4-coligated CD4+ T cell blasts demonstrated reduced levels of the phosphorylated IκB-α protein (Fig. 5 B). The difference in phosphorylation status was more pronounced at 20 than at 4 h. Note that cytoplasmic protein extracts from T cell blasts that were not stimulated exhibited no detectable phosphorylated IκB-α protein (Fig. 5 B), indicating that restimulation was required to induce phosphorylated IκB-α proteins. It is well established that CD28 strongly costimulates T cells (3Lenschow D.J. Walunas T.L. Bluestone J.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 233-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar). Initially, it was assumed that a positive signal was also transduced through the CTLA-4 receptor. However, results have accumulated that suggest CTLA-4 mediates down-regulation of the ongoing immune response. It has been shown that cross-linked anti-CTLA-4 mAb inhibits proliferation in T cells stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAb (6Walunas T.L. Bakker C.Y. Bluestone J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2541-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 9Walunas T.L. Lenschow D.J. Bakker C.Y. Linsley P.S. Freeman G.J. Green J.M. Thompson C.B. Bluestone J.A. Immunity. 1994; 1: 405-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar), whereas soluble anti-CTLA-4 mAb or Fab enhances T cell proliferation and cytokine production. The observations in CTLA-4 deficient mice have strengthened the hypothesis that a negative signal is mediated by CTLA-4 coligation (7Waterhouse P. Penninger J.M. Timms E. Wakeham A. Shahinian A. Lee K.P. Thompson C.B. Griesser H. Mak T.W. Science. 1995; 270: 985-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar, 8Tivol E.A. Borriello F. Schweitzer A.N. Lynch W.P. Bluestone J.A. Sharpe A.H. Immunity. 1995; 3: 541-547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar). In support of this, it has also been shown that costimulation with B7–1 inhibits the response of primed CD28-deficient T cells (17Fallarino F. Fields P.E. Gajewski T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 22Lin H. Rathmell J.C. Gray G.S. Thompson C.B. Leiden J.M. Alegre M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). On the other hand, another study could demonstrate B7-dependent costimulation of CD28-deficient T cells, which suggested that CTLA-4 ligation led to T cell activation rather than down-regulation (4Wu Y. Guo Y. Huang A. Zheng P. Liu Y. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1327-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These contradictory results indicate the importance of studying the effects of CD28 and CTLA-4 in a relevant model with both players present. In attempts to identify intracellular targets involved in CTLA-4 signaling, a motif containing a consensus binding site of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was identified (26Cefai D. Schneider H. Matangkasombut O. Kang H. Brody J. Rudd C.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2223-2230PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have reported activation of a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase after CD28 (34Hutchcroft J.E. Franklin D.P. Tsai B. Harrison-Findik D. Varticovski L. Bierer B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8808-8812Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,35Pages F. Ragueneau M. Rottapel R. Truneh A. Nunes J. Imbert J. Olive D.

Med. 1995; 181: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, the functional importance of the CD28-CTLA-4 interaction with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase required for costimulation of T cells remains unclear (36Schneider H. Prasad K.V. Shoelson S.E. Rudd C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphatase SYP was demonstrated to specifically associate with the CTLA-4 cytoplasmic tail, and showed significant phosphatase activity toward the RAS regulator p52SHC, indicating that the Ras pathway may be regulated by CTLA-4 (21Marengere L.E. Waterhouse P. Duncan G.S. Mittrucker H.W. Feng G.S. Mak T.W. Science. 1996; 272: 1170-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Marengere and co-workers (21Marengere L.E. Waterhouse P. Duncan G.S. Mittrucker H.W. Feng G.S. Mak T.W. Science. 1996; 272: 1170-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) were also able to show that CTLA-4-deficient T cells had hyperactivated protein-tyrosine kinases Fyn, Lck, and ZAP70. This argues for CTLA-4-negative regulation being mediated via the TCR signal pathway. That CTLA-4 ligation inhibits activation of CD28-deficient T cells has also been taken as an argument for CTLA-4 having its effect(s) on TCR signaling-associated molecules. On the other hand, it cannot be ruled out that the CD28 signal pathway is the main target, and that the effects on TCR signaling represent additional substrates for CTLA-4 interference, which are revealed by the genetic removal of CD28. In the present study, we examined the effects of CTLA-4 ligation in CD3/CD28-triggered CD4+ T cell blasts. The experimental model was designed to mimic the role of CTLA-4 on activated T cells. The rationale for doing the experiments on T cell blasts expressing both CD28 and CTLA-4 on the surface was that we believe that CTLA-4 exerts its main function by down-regulating these activated cells. We found a clear inhibitory effect on IL-2 mRNA induction, T cell growth, and cytokine production. Our results are in agreement with previous studies, which show a down-regulation of T cell activation by cross-linking CTLA-4 with CD3/CD28 (5Krummel M.F. Allison J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar). T cell blasts stimulated with CD3/CD28/CTLA-4 mAb and human recombinant IL-2 proliferated strongly, indicating that these cells expressed functional IL-2R. However, the cells produced no detectable IL-2, which suggested that the blockade of proliferation by CTLA-4 was mainly a consequence of its interference with IL-2 protein production. Several transcription factors, such as NF-κB, AP-1, and Oct, have been described as critical for transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene promoter (14Ward S.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 37Serfling E. Avots A. Neumann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 181-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Analysis of CTLA-4-ligated T cell blasts showed only small amounts of NF-κB and AP-1 binding activity in nuclear protein extracts. However, large amounts of NF-κB and AP-1 DNA binding activity were induced in CD3/CD28-stimulated T cell blasts. TCR signaling alone can lead to recruitment of NF-κB and AP-1; however, the magnitude of these factors is superinduced by CD28-mediated costimulation. In our studies, an inhibition of the analyzed transcription factors could not be observed after CTLA-4 and CD3 ligation alone but required CD28 ligation. Moreover, we found that coengagement of CTLA-4 induced only low levels of IκB-α phosphorylation in the cytosol, compared with a significant amount of phosphorylated IκB-α in CD3/CD28-stimulated T cell blasts. In contrast, similar levels of total IκB-α protein level were found in the cytoplasmic protein preparations. The existence of mainly unphosphorylated IκB-α may represent inactivation of residual low amounts of NF-κB in the cytosol of CTLA-4-ligated T cell blasts but could also be attributable to a CTLA-4-mediated reduction of synthesis of NF-κB/Rel family proteins. Our findings concerning AP-1 are in concordance with a study by Calvoet al. (20Calvo C.R. Amsen D. Kruisbeek A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1645-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), who showed that CTLA-4 selectively turns off activation of downstream TCR/CD28 signaling events, i.e.activation of ERK-2 and JNK (20Calvo C.R. Amsen D. Kruisbeek A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1645-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the effects shown on ERK-2 and JNK activity occurred very rapidly after stimulation, which is in contrast to the present results. In the present study a much later effect by CTLA-4 coligation was detected. Only small quantitative differences were exhibited at earlier time points (1–8 h; data not shown). The observed differences between the studies may be explained by the divergence in our experimental protocols. Calvo et al. (20Calvo C.R. Amsen D. Kruisbeek A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1645-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) studied lymph node T cells prestimulated with soluble anti-CD3/anti-CD28 for 40 h and rested before restimulation. Furthermore, they focused on kinase activity in their experiments. A recent report concluded that IκB kinase-α and -β could mediate the NF-κB-inducing activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase 1 (MEKK1), which supports a general model of sequential involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase 1, IκB kinase, and IκB in NF-κB activation (38Lee F.S. Peters R.T. Dang L.C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9319-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase 1 has also previously been shown to be central for the JNK pathway and was proposed to be a coordinate activator of both NF-κB and AP-1 pathways (23Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Our findings, with profound effects on both NF-κB and AP-1, support the idea that CTLA-4 interferes with a common coordinator of these pathways, e.g.mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase 1. Moreover, ERK2 activity was shown to be down-regulated by CTLA-4 coligation in the absence of CD28 coligation (20Calvo C.R. Amsen D. Kruisbeek A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1645-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). TCR signaling was effected and the ERK2 activity induced was lower than in the absence of CTLA-4. Together these data indicate that CTLA-4 down-regulates T cells by affecting both the CD28 and TCR signaling pathway. Importantly, in our system with CD3/CD28/CTLA-4 present on activated T cells, the main down-regulatory effects seem mainly mediated through effects on the CD28 signaling pathway. In conclusion, one could speculate that in the T cell cap facing toward the antigen-presenting cell, phosphatases activated through binding to the CTLA-4 cytoplasmic tail act on substrates in its vicinity. Depending on the strength of the signal through TCR versusCD28, one could find an impact on the respective pathways. We have used anti-CD3 mAb as a model antigen, which gives rise to a strong T cell response. Despite this, the inhibition by CTLA-4 coligation could be demonstrated only in the presence of coligated CD28, which suggests that the main function of CTLA-4 is suppression of the T cell response by modulating signals delivered through CD28 ligation. The contributions of Jan Nilsson, Ann-Sofie Thornqvist, Agnethe Henriksson, Christa Edvardsson, Madelein Jacobsson-Andén, and Dr. Vicky Avery are greatly appreciated."

The same principle of co-elution was used to identify another G-protein associated with platelet TXA2 receptors. It was found that in addition to Gαq, purification of TXA2 receptors by ligand (SQ31,491)-affinity chromatography resulted in the co-purification of a member of the G12 family. Using an antipeptide antibody specific for the human G13 α-subunit, this G-protein was identified as Gα13. In separate experiments, it was found that the TXA2 receptor agonist U46619 stimulated [35S]guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) incorporation into G13 α-subunit. Further evidence for functional coupling of G13 to TXA2 receptors was provided in studies where solubilized platelet membranes were subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography using an antibody raised against native TXA2 receptor protein. It was found that U46619 induced a significant decrease in Gαq and Gα13 association with the receptor protein. These results indicate that both Gαq and Gα13 are functionally coupled to TXA2 receptors and dissociate upon agonist activation. Furthermore, this agonist effect was specifically blocked by pretreatment with the TXA2 receptor antagonist, BM13.505. Taken collectively, these data provide direct evidence that endogenous Gα13 is a TXA2 receptor-coupled G-protein, as: 1) its α-subunit can be co-purified with the receptor protein using both ligand and immunoaffinity chromatography, 2) TXA2 receptor activation stimulates GTPγS binding to Gα13, and 3) Gα13 affinity for the TXA2 receptor can be modulated by agonist-receptor activation.

Circulation. 1990; 81: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, despite recent progress, the TXA2-mediated signal transduction pathway is not completely understood. In this regard, previous studies have shown that one mechanism by which TXA2 receptors act is through stimulation of phospholipase C (PLC) leading to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) production, and subsequent intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (10Brace L.D.

J. 1993; 291: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, separate studies have linked this stimulation of PLC activity to TXA2 receptor signal transduction through the pertussis toxin-insensitive guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein) Gq (16Shenker A. Goldsmith P. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9309-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Knezevic I. Borg C. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26011-26017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, experiments conducted in our laboratory provided evidence for the existence of intraplatelet Ca2+ mobilization, which is independent of IP3 production (15Knezevic I. Dieter J.P. Le Breton G.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 260: 947-955PubMed Google Scholar). This finding raised the possibility that TXA2 receptors may also couple to a G-protein family separate from Gq. Additional evidence in support of this notion was provided by experiments showing that a C-terminal antibody which recognizes the α-subunit of Gq and G11was not able to completely inhibit U46619-stimulated GTPase activity (16Shenker A. Goldsmith P. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9309-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, ligand and immunoaffinity chromatography purification of the TXA2 receptor-G-protein complex allowed co-purification of G-proteins distinct from Gq (17Knezevic I. Borg C. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26011-26017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results led to the hypothesis that TXA2receptors might couple to a G-protein(s) to stimulates platelet aggregation independently of the Gq-PLC-IP3pathway. Although this putative G-protein has not been identified, recent reports have provided indirect evidence that it may belong to the G12 family (18Strathmann M. Wilkie T.M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7407-7409Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19Strathmann M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acac. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 88: 5582-5586Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In one study, it was shown that activation of platelet TXA2 receptors led to increased incorporation of the photo reactive GTP analogue [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide into both G12 and G13 α-subunits, which may suggest coupling of TXA2 receptors to these α-subunits (20Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). On the other hand, as all the agonists tested (U46619, thrombin, ADP, and vasopressin) produced [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide incorporation, this labeling could also have been due to activation of a downstream signaling event or to cross-talk between these separate signal transduction pathways. In separate studies, it was shown that the affinity state of TXA2 receptors transfected in COS-7 cells could be influenced by co-expression of Gα13 (21Allan C.J. Higashiura K. Martin M. Morinelli T.A. Kurtz D.T. Geoffroy O. Meier G.P. Gettys T.W. Halushka P.V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 277: 1132-1139PubMed Google Scholar). Although this finding is consistent with the notion that TXA2 receptors have the capacity to couple with G13, it is not clear whether such coupling occurs at physiological concentrations of receptor and/or G-protein. Consequently, two independent reports have provided indirect evidence that TXA2 receptors may couple to a Gα subunit in the G12/13 family. Based on these considerations, in the present study we performed experiments to determine whether this phenomenon occurs in a native platelet preparation using endogenous concentrations of TXA2 receptor and Gα subunits. To this end, affinity purification of the receptor-G-protein complex was employed to measure direct physical association of TXA2receptors and Gα12/13. This approach has been previously applied in our laboratory to the identification of Gαq as one of the G-proteins associated with the platelet TXA2receptors (17Knezevic I. Borg C. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26011-26017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was found that, in addition to Gαq, purification of the TXA2 receptors resulted in co-elution of Gα13. Furthermore, agonist activation of TXA2 receptors caused an increase in GTPγS binding to G13 α-subunit as well as dissociation of the receptor-Gα13 complex, providing evidence that Gα13 is indeed functionally coupled to platelet TXA2 receptors. Outdated platelet concentrates were obtained from Heartland Blood Services (Aurora, IL). SQ intermediate (ethyl-[1S [1α, 2α-(Z),3α,4α]]-7-[[3-aminomethyl]-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl]-5-heptenoate) for the synthesis of SQ31,491 was provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb Institute for Medical Research.

The peptide was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin usingm-maleimidobenzoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester and injected into White New Zealand Pasteurella multocida-free rabbits, according to previously described procedures (23Borg C.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the C-terminal region of Gαq (G-QL, Table I) were produced as described previously (16Shenker A. Goldsmith P. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol.

Antibodies were purified from rabbit serum by chromatography on protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, and the IgG fractions were labeled with carrier-free Na125I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the IODO-BEADS iodination reagent (Pierce). Rabbit polyclonal IgG raised against residues 2–21 of Gα12(G-12) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6741-6745Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although this antibody has been suggested to be specific for Gα12, C-terminal segments of G12 and G13 differ only by 4 amino acids (18Strathmann M. Wilkie T.M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lim C.-T. Lam S.C.-T. Komiotis D. Venton D.L. Le Breton G.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Typically, this method resulted in a 60–70% solubilization of platelet membrane protein, yielding a final protein concentration of 2–3 mg/ml. TXA2receptors were purified as described previously (5Kim S. Lim C.-T. Lam S.C.-T. Komiotis D. Venton D.L. Le Breton G.C. Biochem.

Briefly, the TXA2 receptor antagonist SQ31,491 was immobilized to Affi-Gel 102, and CHAPS-solubilized membranes (4 mg of protein) in buffer A (20% glycerol, 500 mm KCl, 0.2 mmEGTA, and 0.5 mg/ml asolectin) were incubated with the matrix overnight. Unbound proteins were eluted as flow-through, and the column was washed with buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mmCHAPS, 20% glycerol, 500 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mg/ml asolectin, pH 7.4). TXA2 receptors and receptor-associated proteins were then eluted with buffer D containing 50 mm TXA2 receptor antagonist, BM13.177 (25Patscheke H. Stegmeier K. Muller-Beckmann B. Sponer G. Staiger C.

After elution of the first 1-ml fraction, the flow was stopped for 30 min and restarted to elute the subsequent 1-ml fractions. TXA2 receptor binding activity as well as Gαqimmunoreactivity were found to be concentrated in the first fraction following the 30-min incubation (17Knezevic I. Borg C. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol.

A modification of this method was used in order to allow further identification of the TXA2receptor-associated G-proteins (27Djellas Y. Antonakis K. Le Breton G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Specifically, after unbound proteins were washed with buffer D, 3 μg/ml 125I-G-QL IgG, 125I-G-12 IgG, or 125I-G-13 IgG (or the same protein concentration of 125I-labeled preimmune IgG (PI IgG)) was added, and the reaction mixture was allowed to incubate for 1 h at 20 °C. Unbound antibodies were washed with buffer D, and elution of TXA2 receptors and receptor-associated proteins was performed as described above. The elution fractions were counted for 125I activity and specific binding attributable to Gαq, Gα12, or Gα13 was defined as the difference between the counts eluted from the125I-antibody columns minus the counts eluted from the125I-PI IgG column. Solubilized platelet membranes were prepared as described (5Kim S. Lim C.-T. Lam S.C.-T. Komiotis D. Venton D.L. Le Breton G.C. Biochem.

The preparation (4 mg of protein) was then incubated with an immunoaffinity matrix coupled to an anti-TXA2 receptor antibody (TxAb) for 1 h at 20 °C (28Borg C. Lim C.-T. Yeomans D.C. Dieter J.P.

The column was eluted with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5), and the 3-ml elution fraction was counted for 125I activity. Specific binding attributable to Gαq or Gα13 was defined as the difference between the counts eluted from the 125I-G-QL or125I-G-13 columns, respectively, minus the counts eluted from the 125I-PI IgG column. Eluted counts were normalized to the amount of purified TXA2 receptor protein, as measured by densitometric analysis of the immunoaffinity column elution fractions immunoblotted with TxAb.

Res. 1987; 58: 182Google Scholar) was used to block U46619 effects, BM13.505 (10 μm) was incubated for 30 min before addition of U46619. Solubilized platelet membranes (4 mg of protein) were prepared as described (5Kim S. Lim C.-T. Lam S.C.-T. Komiotis D. Venton D.L. Le Breton G.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and incubated with 10 μm GTPγS (5 × 106cpm [35S]GTPγS) for 5 min at room temperature in the presence of 1 μm GDP. The incubation was then allowed to proceed for an additional 15 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of 10 nm U46619. The preparation was added to 20 μl of G-13 IgG, which had been preincubated with 55 μl of a 10% (w/v) suspension of protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were collected, washed to remove nonspecifically bound proteins and incubated with 1 mm G-13 peptide for 1 h at room temperature to specifically elute G13 α-subunits. The fractions were then added to 5 ml of EconosafeTM (Research Product International, IL) and analyzed by scintillation spectrometry. Eluted counts were normalized to the amount of immunoprecipitated G13 α-subunit, as measured by densitometric analysis of the elution fractions immunoblotted with G-13 IgG. Immulon 2 microtiter plates were coated with either 12.5 μg of synthetic peptide or 125 μg of solubilized platelet membranes. Following incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the plates were washed three times with modified Tyrode's buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dextrose, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and then blocked by incubation for 1 h with 5% bovine serum albumin in the same buffer. Serial dilutions of antisera were applied to the wells and incubated for an additional 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed three times with the modified Tyrode's buffer, and bound antibodies were detected by incubation for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. After extensive washing, the color reaction was developed by addition of 50 μl of 0.4 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine, 0.012% H2O2 in 80 mm citrate phosphate, pH 5. An equal volume of 2 n H2SO4 was then added, and the presence of specific antibodies was measured by absorbance at 490 nm. The affinity column eluates were first concentrated using Millipore Ultrafree-MC filters. 20–40 μl of sample (30–40 μg of protein) was then subjected to SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) using 10% minigels, under nonreducing conditions, and the proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes according to the method of Towbin et al. (32Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). After transfer, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 3% gelatin in Tris-buffered saline and incubated overnight at room temperature with the indicated dilution of G-QL, G-12/13, or Gαcommon IgG. The blots were washed and treated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) as the secondary antibody. The immunoreactive proteins were detected with avidin and horseradish peroxidase, followed by 0.5 mg/ml 4-chloro-1-naphthol. Data were analyzed according to Student's paired t test (*, p < 0.05; **,p < 0.005). In order to purify TXA2 receptor-associated G-proteins, solubilized platelet membranes were subjected to ligand affinity chromatography, and the column was eluted with the TXA2 receptor antagonist BM13.177 (5Kim S.

Res. 1984; 33: 277-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Elution fractions were then immunoblotted with G-protein α-subunit specific antibodies. As illustrated in Fig. 1, G-QL IgG, which recognizes Gq and G11α-subunits, blotted a major protein band in the molecular mass region of 42 kDa and two minor bands at approximately 38 kDa in solubilized platelet membranes and the ligand column elution fraction. This pattern of primary labeling at 42 kDa and secondary labeling at lower molecular masses has been previously described in human platelets and other tissues and has been attributed to proteolytic fragments of Gαq (16Shenker A. Goldsmith P. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9309-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, blotting with G-12/13 IgG also revealed immunoreactivity for the α-subunit of G12/13. Thus, a single band in the molecular mass range of 43–44 kDa was observed both in solubilized platelet membranes and the ligand affinity column eluate (Fig. 1). On the other hand, an antibody against Gαcommon revealed that members of the Gαsand Gαi families were only present in solubilized platelet membranes but not in the affinity column eluate (data not shown). These results indicate that the ligand chromatography-purified TXA2 receptor-G-protein complex is selectively enriched in both Gαq and a member(s) of the Gα12family. In order to determine whether TXA2 receptors purified in complex with either Gα12 or Gα13, the ligand affinity eluate was first probed using a new antibody specifically directed against Gα13. This polyclonal antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with a peptide sequence unique to an internal segment of the human G13 α-subunit (G-13, Table I) (22Kabouridis P.S. Waters S.T. Escobar S. Stanners J. Tsoukas C.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 144: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Evaluation of the sera and IgG revealed that specific antibodies against Gα13 were successfully raised. Specifically, the anti-G-13 serum was shown by ELISA to react in a concentration-dependent manner with its cognate peptide (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, evaluation of solubilized platelet membranes by ELISA revealed positive immunoreactivity against an endogenous platelet protein (Fig.2 B). In addition, immunoblotting of solubilized platelet membranes with G-13 serum and IgG demonstrated a predominant 43–44 kDa protein (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2, respectively), consistent with the molecular mass previously described for G13 α-subunit (18Strathmann M. Wilkie T.M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7407-7409Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19Strathmann M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acac. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1995; 144: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The blotting of this band could be prevented by preincubation of G-13 IgG with its cognate peptide (Fig. 3,lane 3). To utilize this antibody for quantitative evaluation of Gα13, G-13 IgG was iodinated by standard procedures.Figure 3Immunoblot of solubilized platelet membranes against G-13 antiserum and G-13 IgG. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The membranes were incubated overnight with 1:50 dilution of G-13 antiserum (lane 1), 1:50 dilution of G-13 IgG (lane 2), or 1:50 dilution of G-13 IgG preincubated with 14.4 μg/ml (100 μm) G-13 peptide(lane 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the next experiments, solubilized platelet membranes were incubated with the ligand affinity matrix (5Kim S. Lim C.-T. Lam S.C.-T. Komiotis D. Venton D.L. Le Breton G.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The column was washed with buffer and then equilibrated with 125I-G-13 IgG. The TXA2 receptor-G-protein complex was next eluted by BM13.177 (25Patscheke H. Stegmeier K. Muller-Beckmann B. Sponer G. Staiger C. Neugebauer G. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1984; 43: S312-S318PubMed Google Scholar, 26Patscheke H. Stegmeier K. Thromb. Res. 1984; 33: 277-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and the elution fractions were quantitated for125I. As Gαq is known to couple to TXA2 receptors (16Shenker A. Goldsmith P. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9309-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Knezevic I. Borg C. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26011-26017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a positive control experiment was conducted using 125I-G-QL IgG. Control experiments were also performed using 125I-labeled preimmune IgG to determine nonspecific binding of both G-QL and G-13 IgG. Reported specific binding represents the difference between the counts eluted from the 125I-anti-α-subunit IgG column and the counts eluted from the 125I-labeled preimmune IgG column. Using this procedure, it was found that TXA2 receptors co-purified not only with Gαq but also with Gα13. Thus, Fig. 4illustrates that the affinity column eluate contained 53 ± 5% and 24 ± 5% specific binding for Gαq(solid bar) and Gα13(open bar), respectively. These findings, therefore, provide evidence that both Gαq and Gα13 are in direct physical association with endogenous platelet TXA2 receptors. The next series of experiments was performed to determine whether Gα12 also copurified as part of the TXA2receptor-G-protein complex. These studies employed a specific antibody directed at a unique N-terminal segment of Gα12 (G-12, Table I), which was also iodinated for quantitative purposes. Again, the TXA2 receptor-G-protein complex was purified by ligand affinity chromatography and the amount of Gα12 present in the eluate was determined using 125I-G-12 IgG. As above, specific binding was determined by parallel experiments using125I-labeled preimmune IgG. It was found that, in contrast to Gα13, Gα12 did not appear to co-purify with TXA2 receptors (Fig. 4, hatched bar). In these experiments, it can be seen that the counts attributable to Gα12 are less than the counts representing nonspecific binding by preimmune IgG. Although this decrease is not significant, it can be explained on the basis that G-12 IgG is enriched in immunoglobulins against Gα12 and consequently contains a lesser percentage of nonspecific proteins than preimmune IgG. As nonspecific protein is presumably responsible for nonspecific binding observed with preimmune IgG, the difference between125I-G-12 IgG counts and 125I-labeled preimmune IgG counts yields a negative number. The same phenomenon would also suggest that the specific binding observed for both G-QL and G-13 IgG (Fig. 4) is probably underestimated, as each of these IgG fractions contain less nonspecific proteins than their preimmune IgG controls. Furthermore, this consideration would indicate that the relative percentage of specific binding with G-QL and G-13 IgG may not necessarily represent the actual distribution of Gαq and Gα13 within the TXA2 receptor-G-protein complex. Taken together, the above results provide evidence that in addition to Gαq, platelet TXA2 receptors are coupled to endogenous Gα13. I"

From the binding experiments, we defined the domains of Axin that bind glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and β-catenin. We also examined the ability of each Axin mutant to inhibit lymphoid enhancer factor-1 (Lef-1) reporter activity in a cell line expressing high levels of β-catenin. Axin mutants that did not bind GSK-3β or β-catenin were ineffective in suppressing Lef-1 reporter activity. Binding GSK-3β and β-catenin was not sufficient for this inhibitory effect of Axin. Axin mutants with C-terminal truncations lacked the ability to inhibit Lef-1 reporter activity, even though they bound GSK-3β and β-catenin. The C-terminal region was required for binding to Axin itself. Substitution of the C-terminal region with an unrelated dimerizing molecule, the retinoid X receptor restored its inhibitory effect on Lef-1-dependent transcription.

Presently, we found in both rat adipocytes and 3T3/L1 adipocytes that okadaic acid provoked partial insulin-like increases in glucose transport, which were inhibited by phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, and inhibitors of atypical protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, ζ and λ. Moreover, in both cell types, okadaic acid provoked increases in the activity of immunoprecipitable PKC-ζ/λ by a PI 3-kinase-dependent mechanism. In keeping with apparent PI 3-kinase dependence of stimulatory effects of okadaic acid on glucose transport and PKC-ζ/λ activity, okadaic acid provoked insulin-like increases in membrane PI 3-kinase activity in rat adipocytes; the mechanism for PI 3-kinase activation was uncertain, however, because it was not apparent in phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. Of further note, okadaic acid provoked partial insulin-like increases in the translocation of hemagglutinin antigen-tagged GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in transiently transfected rat adipocytes, and these stimulatory effects on hemagglutinin antigen-tagged GLUT4 translocation were inhibited by co-expression of kinase-inactive forms of PKC-ζ and PKC-λ but not by a double mutant (T308A, S473A), activation-resistant form of protein kinase B. Our findings suggest that, as with insulin, PI 3-kinase-dependent atypical PKCs, ζ and λ, are required for okadaic acid-induced increases in GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport in rat adipocytes and 3T3/L1 adipocytes. Okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, is known to provoke insulin-like effects on GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport, but the underlying mechanism is obscure. Presently, we found in both rat adipocytes and 3T3/L1 adipocytes that okadaic acid provoked partial insulin-like increases in glucose transport, which were inhibited by phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, and inhibitors of atypical protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, ζ and λ. Moreover, in both cell types, okadaic acid provoked increases in the activity of immunoprecipitable PKC-ζ/λ by a PI 3-kinase-dependent mechanism.

Of further note, okadaic acid provoked partial insulin-like increases in the translocation of hemagglutinin antigen-tagged GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in transiently transfected rat adipocytes, and these stimulatory effects on hemagglutinin antigen-tagged GLUT4 translocation were inhibited by co-expression of kinase-inactive forms of PKC-ζ and PKC-λ but not by a double mutant (T308A, S473A), activation-resistant form of protein kinase B. Our findings suggest that, as with insulin, PI 3-kinase-dependent atypical PKCs, ζ and λ, are required for okadaic acid-induced increases in GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport in rat adipocytes and 3T3/L1 adipocytes. Okadaic acid provokes insulin-like effects on the translocation of the GLUT4 glucose transporter and glucose transport by mechanisms that are presently obscure. In rat adipocytes, stimulatory effects of okadaic acid on a process that is largely dependent on glucose transport, viz. acute incorporation of labeled glucose into lipids, are inhibited by the inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 1The abbreviations used are: PI, phosphatidylinositol; PKB, protein kinase B; IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate-1; KI, kinase inactive; 2-DOG, 2-[3H]deoxyglucose; PKC, protein kinase C; HA, hemagglutinin antigen; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; PDK-1, 3-phosphoinositidedependent kinase-1 3-kinase, wortmannin (1LeMarchand-Brustel Y.

Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Coffer P.J. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which generally functions downstream of PI 3-kinase. These findings therefore raised the possibility that okadaic acid, like insulin, may activate PI 3-kinase and dependent processes, including PKB activation and glucose transport, in the rat adipocyte. However, effects of okadaic acid on PI 3-kinase and effects of PI 3-kinase inhibitors on okadaic acid-stimulated glucose transport in rat adipocytes have not been reported. In addition, in rat skeletal muscles (1LeMarchand-Brustel Y. Gautier N. Cormont M. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3564-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and human adipocytes (3Rondinone C.M. Smith U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18148-18153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), stimulatory effects of okadaic acid on glucose transport are wortmannin-insensitive and therefore appear to be largely independent of PI 3-kinase; moreover, in rat skeletal muscle (4Jullien D. Tanti J.F. Heydrick S.J. Gautier N. Gremeaux T. van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15246-15251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 3T3/L1 adipocytes (4Jullien D. Tanti J.F. Heydrick S.J. Gautier N. Gremeaux T. van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18148-18153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), okadaic acid alone has no effect on phosphotyrosine-associated PI 3-kinase activity, and, in fact, inhibits insulin effects on this PI 3-kinase activity, apparently via enhanced serine/threonine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) (5Tanti J.F. Gremeaux T. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6051-6057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, some findings suggest that okadaic acid can activate glucose transport independently of PI 3-kinase. To add to the confusion as to whether okadaic acid activates PI 3-kinase and/or PI 3-kinase-regulated processes in rat adipocytes, there is uncertainty as to what protein kinase(s) serves as a distal activator of GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport during okadaic action. In this regard, although PKB is activated by okadaic acid in rat adipocytes and transient expression of a membrane-targeted constitutively active PKB results in the activation of GLUT4 translocation in the rat adipocyte (6Cong L. Chen H. Li Y. Zhou L McGibbon M.A. Taylor S.I. Quon M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is uncertain if PKB is required for effects of okadaic acid on GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport. Indeed, in rat adipocytes, only a relatively small fraction of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation is inhibited by a kinase-inactive (KI) form of PKB (6Cong L. Chen H. Li Y. Zhou L McGibbon M.A. Taylor S.I. Quon M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, in 3T3/L1 adipocytes, studies in which a double mutant (T308A,S473A), activation-resistant form of PKB was used as an effective dominant-negative inhibitor for insulin-sensitive PKB-mediated processes (e.g. protein synthesis) suggest that PKB is not required for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport (7Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). With respect to other potential mechanisms for activating glucose transport, PKC-ζ and PKC-λ are activated by insulin through a PI 3-kinase-dependent mechanism (8Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Karnam P.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4721-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) appear to be dependent upon the activation of one or both of these atypical PKCs. We therefore examined the possibility that the effects of okadaic acid on glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation in rat adipocytes and 3T3/L1 adipocytes may be mediated through the activation of PKC-ζ and/or PKC-λ. As described (8Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Karnam P. Bandyopadhyay G. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30075-30082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), rat adipocytes were prepared by collagenase digestion of epididymal fat pads, equilibrated in glucose-free Krebs-Ringer phosphate medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin with or without PKC-ζ/λ inhibitors (cell-permeable myristoylated PKC-ζ/λ pseudosubstrate (myr-SIYRRGARRWRKL; Quality Controlled Biochemical, Hopkington, MA) or RO 31-8220 (Alexis, San Diego, CA)) or PI 3-kinase inhibitors (wortmannin (Sigma) or LY 294002 (Alexis)), and subsequently incubated, as described in the text, with or without okadaic acid or insulin. Similarly, as described by Bandyopadhyay et al. (9Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Zhao L. Yu B. Avignon A. Galloway L. Karnam P. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2551-2558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), 3T3/L1 adipocytes were differentiated, equilibrated, and incubated in glucose-free Krebs-Ringer phosphate medium with the above described inhibitors and insulin or okadaic acid as described in the text. Rat adipocytes were treated for 30 min with or without 10 nminsulin or 1 μm okadaic acid, 0.1 mm 2-DOG containing 0.1 μCi [3H]DOG (NEN Life Science Products) was added, and uptake of 2-[3H]DOG over 1 min was measured as described (8Standaert M.L.

Activation of immunoprecipitable PKC-ζ/λ was determined as described (8Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Karnam P. Bandyopadhyay G. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol.

In brief, after incubation of intact cells with or without okadaic acid or insulin, cells were homogenized and cell lysates (defatted, post-nuclear homogenates in buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 1.2 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm NaF, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% Nonidet) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) that recognizes the C-terminal sequences of both PKC-ζ and PKC-λ (these PKCs, except for one amino acid, have identical sequences in their C-terminal 26 amino acids). After overnight incubation at 0–4 °C, precipitates were collected on protein AG-Agarose beads, washed, and incubated for 8 min at 30 °C in 50 μl of buffer containing 50 mmTris/HCL (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm Na3V04, 100 μmNa4P207, 1 mm NaF, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3–5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products), 50 μm ATP, 4 μg of phosphatidylserine, and 40 μm159Ser-PKC-ε (amino acids 153–164)-NH2 substrate (Quality Controlled Biochemicals). After incubation, aliquots of the reaction mixtures were spotted on P81 filter paper, washed in 5% acetic acid, and counted for32P. Membrane PI 3-kinase activity was measured in rat adipocytes as described (12Standaert M.L. Bandyopadhyay G. Galloway L. Ono Y. Mukai H. Farese R.V. J. Biol.

In brief, after treatment of intact cells with or without 300 nm insulin or 1 μm okadaic acid, cells were sonicated, post-nuclear defatted homogenates were centrifuged at 400,000 × gfor 45 min, and resultant membranes were assayed for PI 3-kinase activity. After assay, lipids were extracted and resolved by thin layer chromatography (12Standaert M.L. Bandyopadhyay G. Galloway L. Ono Y. Mukai H. Farese R.V. J. Biol.

PI 3-kinase activity was also measured in phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (antiserum obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). As described (6Cong L. Chen H. Li Y.

(The double mutant form of PKB was made by site-directed mutagenesis of the wild-type construct (6Cong L. Chen H. Li Y. Zhou L McGibbon M.A. Taylor S.I. Quon M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the MORPH mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). Mutagenic oligonucleotides 5′-CCA CTA TGA AGG CAT TTT GCG GAA CGC CGG-3′ and 5′-TTC CCC CAG TTC GCC TAC TCG GCC AGT GGC ACA-3′ created point mutations T308A and S473A as well as silent mutations that created a new BglI site and disrupted anXmnI site. Mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing.) In brief, 0.8 ml of 50% cell suspension was electroporated in the presence of 3 μg of pCIS2 containing cDNA insert encoding HA-GLUT4, and 7 μg of pCDNA3 containing no insert (i.e. vector only) or cDNA insert encoding KI-PKC-ζ or KI-PKC-λ, or 7 or 14 μg pCIS2 containing no insert (i.e.vector only) or cDNA insert encoding T308A,S473A-PKB. After overnight incubation to allow time for expression of cDNA inserts, the cells were washed and equilibrated in glucose-free Krebs-Ringer phosphate medium, and treated for 30 min with or without 10 nm insulin or 1 μm okadaic acid. After incubation, 2 mm potassium cyanide was added to immobilize GLUT4, and cells were washed, counted, and examined for surface content of HA-GLUT4 using mouse monoclonal anti-HA primary antibody (Babco, Berkeley, CA) and 125I-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG second antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Note that, in the absence of cDNA insert, the amounts of DNA used in these transfections have no effect on either basal or insulin-stimulated HA-GLUT4 translocation (8Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Karnam P. Bandyopadhyay G. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30075-30082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar,13Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Kikkawa U. Ono Y. Moscat J. Farese R.V. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar); also, note that KI-PKC-ζ does not inhibit GTPγS-stimulated HA-GLUT4 translocation, which is independent of atypical PKCs (13Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Kikkawa U. Ono Y. Moscat J. Farese R.V. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Also note that HA-GLUT4 expression (assessed by blotting the HA epitope) was not influenced by the presence of cDNA inserts. Thus, observed inhibitory effects of KI-PKC-ζ and KI-PKC-λ on HA-GLUT4 translocation specifically reflected changes in signaling factors used by insulin and okadaic acid, rather than the GLUT4 translocation process itself. In rat adipocytes, okadaic acid (1 μm) provoked increases in 2-DOG uptake that were approximately 30–50% of those provoked by maximally effective 10 nm insulin; moreover, PI 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, inhibited effects of okadaic acid, as well as insulin, on 2-DOG uptake (Fig. 1). Inhibitors of atypical PKCs, viz. RO 31–8220 and the cell-permeable myristoylated PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate, also inhibited effects of okadaic acid and insulin on 2-DOG uptake (Fig. 1). Note that the doses of RO 31–8220 that were required to inhibit 2-DOG uptake (as stimulated by both okadaic acid and insulin) were similar to those previously found to inhibit atypical PKCs (8Standaert M.L.

As in rat adipocytes, okadaic acid provoked increases in 2-DOG uptake in 3T3/L1 adipocytes that were approximately 30–40% of those provoked by maximally effective 100 nm insulin; these effects of okadaic acid and insulin were also inhibited by wortmannin, RO 31–8220, and the myristoylated PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate (Fig.2). Okadaic acid provoked time- and dose-dependent increases in the activity of immunoprecipitable PKC-ζ/λ in rat adipocytes. Increases in immunoprecipitable PKC-ζ/λ enzyme activity varied between 50 and 80% at 15 min of treatment with 1 μm okadaic acid, and these increases were approximately 50% of those provoked by insulin (Fig. 3). As with 2-DOG uptake, okadaic acid-induced increases in immunoprecipitable PKC-ζ/λ enzyme activity were inhibited by wortmannin and LY294002 (Fig. 3). As in rat adipocytes, 1 μm okadaic acid provoked wortmannin- and LY294002-inhibitable increases in PKC-λ activity in 3T3/L1 adipocytes (these cells contain PKC-λ, but not PKC-ζ, see Ref. 16Alessi D.R.

Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that were approximately 50% of those provoked by insulin (Fig. 4). Okadaic acid provoked increases in membrane-associated PI 3-kinase activity, which were comparable to those observed with insulin treatment in rat adipocytes (Fig. 5). In contrast, okadaic acid had no effect on PI 3-kinase that was recovered in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates, whereas insulin markedly increased phosphotyrosine-associated PI 3-kinase activity (data not shown). Okadaic acid provoked increases in the translocation of HA-GLUT4 to the plasma membrane that were approximately 40–60% of those induced by insulin in transiently transfected rat adipocytes (Figs. 6 and7). Co-transfection of KI-PKC-ζ inhibited the stimulatory effects of okadaic acid, as well as insulin, on HA-GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 6) (see Ref. 13Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Kikkawa U. Ono Y.

Note that PKC-ζ and PKC-λ apparently function interchangeably in supporting insulin-stimulated HA-GLUT4 translocation (see Ref. 13Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Kikkawa U. Ono Y. Moscat J.

Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), had no appreciable effect on okadaic acid-stimulated increases in HA-GLUT4 translocation and caused only a mild inhibition (10–20%) of insulin-stimulated HA-GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 7). We found that in both rat adipocytes and 3T3/L1 adipocytes, okadaic acid provoked increases in the activity of immunoprecipitable PKC-ζ/λ; moreover, based upon studies with wortmannin and LY294002, the activation of PKC-ζ/λ by okadaic acid appeared to be dependent upon PI 3-kinase. In keeping with this apparent dependence on PI 3-kinase, the activation of PKC-ζ/λ by okadaic acid was associated with apparent increases in membrane-associated PI 3-kinase activity in rat adipocytes. However, the mechanism whereby membrane-associated PI 3-kinase was activated by okadaic acid in rat adipocytes was unclear, because okadaic acid did not provoke increases in the activity of PI 3-kinase that was recovered in phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. Because the latter primarily reflects the activation of Src homology 2 domains in the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, the possibility remains that okadaic acid may alter the activity of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase independently of the p85 subunit but nevertheless inhibitable by wortmannin and LY294002. Despite the evidence for PI 3-kinase activation during okadaic acid action, alternative explanations for PKC-ζ/λ activation should also be considered. One such alternative is that okadaic acid may have activated 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1), which, in conjunction with D3-PO4 polyphosphoinositides, serves to activate both PKB (16Alessi D.R.

In keeping with the finding that okadaic acid-induced activation of PKC-ζ/λ appeared to dependent upon PI 3-kinase or PDK-1, PKB, another protein kinase signaling factor that operates downstream of PI 3-kinase and PDK-1 (16Alessi D.R.

Coffer P.J. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, several independent lines of evidence lend support to the postulation that okadaic acid activates or requires continued activity of PI 3-kinase and/or PDK-1. Obviously, activation of PI 3-kinase or PDK-1 may explain why effects of okadaic acid on glucose transport are inhibited by wortmannin and LY294002 in both rat adipocytes and 3T3/L1 adipocytes. Whereas okadaic acid appeared to activate PI 3-kinase and PI 3-kinase-dependent processes, viz. PKB, PKC-ζ/λ, GLUT4 translocation, and glucose transport in rat and 3T3/L1 adipocytes, the situation in rat skeletal muscle (4Jullien D. Tanti J.F. Heydrick S.J. Gautier N.

Indeed, the effects of okadaic acid on glucose transport in these tissues are wortmannin-insensitive, and therefore appear to be independent of PI 3-kinase. Further studies are needed to see if okadaic acid activates PKC-ζ/λ in human adipocytes and rat skeletal muscles. Although okadaic acid activates PKB in rat adipocytes (2Tanti J.F. Grillo S.

These findings are similar to those observed during insulin action in 3T3/L1 adipocytes (7Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), in which it was concluded that PKB is not required for insulin-induced activation of glucose transport. On the other hand, in rat adipocytes, a small fraction (approximately 20%) of insulin effects on HA-GLUT4 translocation is blocked by KI-PKB (6Cong L. Chen H. Li Y. Zhou L McGibbon M.A. Taylor S.I.

Further studies are needed to see if there are different requirements for insulin- and okadaic acid-induced effects on GLUT4 translocation in different cell types. In summary, okadaic acid activated PKC-ζ/λ in both rat adipocytes and 3T3/L1 adipocytes by a mechanism that appeared to be dependent upon PI 3-kinase or PDK-1. Moreover, the activation of PKC-ζ/λ was required for effects of okadaic acid on GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport. We thank Sara M. Busquets for her invaluable secretarial assistance."

The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 1The abbreviations used are: LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; rmsd, root mean square deviation; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy is a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family (1Moestrup S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Rev. Biomembr. 1994; 1197: 197-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Members of this family of receptors contain a small cytoplasmic domain, a single membrane-spanning helix, and clusters of two types of small cysteine-rich repeats on the extracellular side, interspersed with regions that contain a YWTD motif. The two types of cysteine-rich repeat are an epidermal growth factor-like repeat of about 50 residues and a complement-like repeat, so named for its presence in complement components C8 and C9, of about 42 residues. Each of these types of repeat contains 6 cysteines that are involved in three intradomain disulfide bonds. The limited evidence on the location of protein ligand-binding sites indicates that such sites are restricted largely to the clusters of complement-like repeats. The LDL receptor contains one cluster of seven such repeats and binds various apolipoproteins, including apoE and apoB100 (2Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). LRP contains a total of 31 such repeats organized into four clusters of 2, 8, 10, and 11 repeats (3Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). These clusters have been designated clusters I, II, III, and IV, respectively. LRP binds a much wider range of protein ligands including apolipoproteins, serpin-proteinase complexes, and α2-macroglobulin-proteinase complexes (1Moestrup S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Rev. Biomembr. 1994; 1197: 197-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Studies on truncated LRP species suggest that cluster II is a major locus for protein ligand binding (4Horn I.R. van den Berg B.M.M. van der Meijden P.Z. Pannekoek H. van Zonneveld A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13608-13613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although structures of three complement-like repeats have been reported from the LDL receptor, one by x-ray crystallography (5Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and two by NMR spectroscopy (6Daly N.L. Scanlon M.J. Djordjevic J.T. Kroon P.A. Smith R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6334-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 7Daly N.L. Djordjevic J.T. Kroon P.A. Smith R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14474-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), no structure of such a repeat has previously been reported from LRP. Both because of the sequence differences between repeats in regions that might form the ligand-binding sites and also because of the more extensive range of protein ligands that LRP can bind compared with the LDL receptor, it is important to make structural comparisons between repeats from different receptors and between repeats from the same receptor to understand differences in ligand and calcium specificity (Fig. 1). We report here the first structure of a complement-like repeat from LRP, CR8. CR8 is the eighth complement-like repeat from the N terminus and is the sixth repeat in cluster II. In overall fold CR8 is very similar to LB5, which in turn is similar to the folds of two other domains from the LDL receptor for which NMR structures are known, LB1 (6Daly N.L. Scanlon M.J. Djordjevic J.T. Kroon P.A. Smith R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6334-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and LB2 (7Daly N.L. Djordjevic J.T. Kroon P.A. Smith R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14474-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, because only 4 of 25 residues are identical between these four domains (excluding cysteines and calcium coordinating residues), 1) each domain presents very different charge densities and hydrophobic patches on its surface, suggesting that each domain will be capable of very different interactions with protein ligands and thus have its own distinct ligand specificity. CR8 was cloned as described previously (8Dolmer K. Huang W. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17016-17023Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 13C/15N-labeled CR8 was expressed as a GST fusion protein in minimal medium containing 0.6% basal medium Eagle vitamin solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 g liter−1(15NH4)2SO4, and 2 g liter−1 13C-labeled glucose. Optimal yield was achieved by harvesting the cells 6 h after induction. GST-complement repeat fusion protein was purified according to Ref. 9Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar, cleaved with thrombin (1/1000 w/w, 5–10 min at 20 °C) and rechromatographed on GSH-Sepharose. Refolding was performed as described. Correct folding was indicated by the ability of the protein to bind calcium tightly, as shown by tryptophan fluorescence change, and to give sensitized terbium fluorescence emission when terbium was bound (8Dolmer K. Huang W. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17016-17023Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 5500 m−1cm−1 estimated from the amino acid composition (10Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). NMR spectra were recorded at the University of Illinois at Chicago on a four channel Bruker DRX600 equipped with a pulsed field gradient accessory and operating at 600.13 MHz for 1H. NMR data were processed and analyzed using Triad 6.3 software (Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, MO). Lyophilized CR8 was dissolved in 20 mm CD3COOD, 10% D2O, pH 5.5, and the pH was maintained at 5.5 by addition of NaOH. The final concentration of protein was approximately 2 mm. Spectra were recorded at 298 K. Resonance assignments and distance constraints were determined using HBHA(CO)NH (11Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Reson. Ser B. 1994; 103: 203-216Crossref Scopus (836) Google Scholar), CBCA(CO)NH (12Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 6291-6293Crossref Scopus (928) Google Scholar), TOCSY-HSQC (13Zhang O.

Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1051) Google Scholar) experiments. HNCA (16Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 96: 432-440Google Scholar) was used for the backbone sequential assignment through α-carbon. Some ambiguities in sequential connectivities of backbone Cα atoms were resolved on the basis of Hα and Hβ chemical shift comparisons between HBHA(CO)NH and TOCSY-HSQC. From these three triple resonance experiments, it was possible to complete the sequential assignments. TOCSY-HSQC and HCCH-TOCSY were used for side chain proton chemical shift assignment. HBHA(CO)NH was used to distinguish β-protons and γ-protons when their proton chemical shifts were very close. The ambiguities in Hα and Hβ assignment (threonine and serine) were resolved by their connected carbon using HCCH-TOCSY. HCCH-TOCSY and 13C-NOESY-HSQC were also used for side chain carbon assignments from known proton assignment. NOE constraints were obtained from 15N-NOESY-HSQC and13C-NOESY-HSQC. Dihedral angle constraints were obtained from an HNHA experiment. HSQC spectra of a sample of CR8 freshly prepared in D2O were recorded to identify slowly exchanging amide protons and hydrogen bonds. Identification of backbone carbonyls involved in coordination to the calcium was made using a two-dimensional HACACO to permit assignment of backbone and side chain carbonyl chemical shifts. A two-dimensional [15N-1H] HSQC experiment was also carried out on the doubly labeled sample, with 13C decoupling at CO and Cα frequencies. Sensitivity enhancement gradient pulse sequences were employed for all experiments in which magnetization was detected on the amide proton. Center frequencies were 4.70 ppm for1H, 118 ppm for 15N, 55 ppm for13Cα, 43 ppm for13Cαβ, and 177 ppm for carbonyl. With resonance assignments in hand, NOEs for backbone-backbone, backbone-side chain, and side chain-side chain were identified and classified as small, medium, or large. For backbone-backbone NOEs, upper bounds of 5.0, 4.0, and 3.0 Å, respectively, were used for these three classes. For backbone-side chain and side chain-side chain NOEs, upper bounds of 5.5, 4.5, and 3.5 Å, respectively, were used for these classes. These values were also the base values used to make pseudo-atom corrections where stereospecific assignments were not available. These distance constraints, as well as torsion angle constraints derived from HNHA measurements of 3JHNHα coupling constants and chemical shift index-based assignment of secondary structure, were used as input for the torsion angle dynamics annealing simulation program DYANA (17Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar). Three disulfide bonds between cysteines were used as additional constraints before annealing. Six hydrogen bonds derived from proton exchange HSQC experiment were also included in the calculation. Energy minimization used the package AMBER (20Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham III., T.E. Ross W.L. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A. Merz K.M. Stanton R.V. Cheng A.L. Vincent J.J. Crowley M.

Force constants of 32 kcal mol−1A−2 for distance constraints and 50 kcal mol−1 radian−2 for dihedral angle constraints were employed. The constraint energy given in Table I is a measure of the mean energy violation, based on these force constants and using the formula: constraint energy = force constant- (current interatom separation − target separation)2. Comparisons of the structures of CR8 and LB5 and graphics representations of structures of CR8, LB5, LB1, and LB2 were made with MOLMOL (18Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol.

Open table in a new tab Plasmid pGEX-2T(XbaI) was a kind gift from Dr. Robert Costa (University of Illinois at Chicago). Sepharose 4B, Sephadex G-50 F and Mono Q (HR5/5) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Terbium peroxide was from Sigma. It was dissolved in concentrated HCl to give the trichloride. 99.997% CaCl2was from Johnson Matthey, Ltd. (15NH4)2SO4 and13C glucose were from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. We have previously shown qualitatively that CR8, the eighth complement-like repeat from LRP, only adopts a well defined structure in the presence of calcium (8Dolmer K. Huang W. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17016-17023Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the requirement for calcium for tight binding of protein ligands by both LRP and the closely related LDL receptor. The assignments and structure determination reported here are therefore for the calcium complex, obtained in the presence of a saturating level of calcium. All NMR assignments of CR8 were carried out on a uniformly13C,15N-labeled or 15N-labeled 44-residue construct prepared as described above. This molecule contains 42 residues (3–44) from LRP (residues 1040–1081) with an additional N-terminal Gly-Ser that resulted from the restriction site present in the vector used to create the GST-CR8 fusion protein DNA construct. The calcium complex was well behaved and gave a single set of resonances, consistent with a single well defined conformation. Despite the small size of the molecule, there was good spectral dispersion, which is illustrated by a 13C-decoupled [15N-1H]-HSQC NMR spectrum (Fig.2). Backbone amides had a 1H chemical shift range of 3.5 ppm, (from 6.73 ppm for Lys39to 10.23 ppm for Asp31) and a 15N chemical shift range of 21ppm (from 107.7 ppm for Gly5 to 128.8 ppm for Asp31). Assignment of backbone atoms (amide15N and 1H, Cα13C and 1H) was made with the aid of triple resonance experiments. Starting from distinctive residues such as glycine, small sequence elements were determined through sequential connectivities using triple resonance experiments. Experiments used in this work include HNCA, HBHA(CO)NH and N-15 edited TOCSY-HSQC. From these experiments, the identities of individual amino acids were tentatively determined from their Cα, Hα, and Hβ chemical shifts, and these small sequence elements were then further assigned to areas in the protein by comparison with the known sequence. The C-terminal amino acid triplet Glu-Gly-Val Cα sequential assignment was easily made from an HNCA experiment, because Gly-Val is a unique pair in the CR8 sequence. This assignment was independently confirmed by comparison of Hα and Hβ between HBHA(CO)NH and TOCSY-HSQC experiments. The sequential connectivities from the C-terminal valine through to Pro21 were determined by HNCA and, where Cαwas degenerate, by HBHA(CO)NH and TOCSY-HSQC. Cys19 Hα has the highest Hα chemical shift (5.24ppm). This was also used as a starting point for sequential assignment by comparison of HBHA(CO)NH and TOCSY-HSQC spectra. The same strategy as described above for the C-terminal half of the molecule was used for the sequential assignment from Ile20 through to Pro3. Sequential assignments were checked against both amide-amide and side chain-amide NOE cross-peaks. Three-dimensional 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC and three-dimensional 13C-edited HCCH-TOCSY were used for other proton and carbon side chain assignments. Some ambiguities of proton assignment were resolved by HBHA(CO)NH connectivities or by their attached carbon in HCCH-TOCSY (e.g. Hα and Hβ of threonine). Carbon side chain assignment ambiguities were resolved by13C-HCCH-NOESY. Some aromatic proton assignment were made from two NOESY experiments. A two-dimensional experiment, HA(CA)CO, was used for side chain and backbone carbonyl assignments to unambiguously assign seven backbone carbonyls, including the backbone carbonyls of residues 24 (Trp in both CR8 and LB5) and 29 (Asp in CR8 but Gly in LB5), which are the two residues that have been shown by x-ray crystallography to contribute carbonyl ligands to the bound calcium in a repeat from the LDL receptor (5Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). A total of 419 assignments were made, consisting of all backbone amide and Cα atoms, except for the Cα13C for residues Gly1 and Ser2 and the two proline15N resonances, 7 backbone carbonyl carbons, 73 side chain carbons, and 158 side chain hydrogen atoms. NOE constraints (Fig. 3) were obtained from the following two experiments: three-dimensional15N-edited NOESY-HSQC with a mixing time of 120 ms and a three-dimensional 1H-13C-correlated NOESY-HSQC in D2O with a mixing time of 120 ms. Only three i, i+3 dαN NOEs were observed, between Pro21 and Trp24, between Leu22 and Arg25, and between Ser36 and Lys39. Dihedral angle constraints were obtained from HNHA measurements of3JHNHα coupling constants and chemical shift index-based assignment of secondary structure. Six slowly exchanging amide protons were identified from HSQC spectra of a freshly prepared sample in D2O (Fig. 3). Structural calculations for Ca2+-CR8 were performed using the torsion angle dynamics annealing simulation program DYANA, with a total of 545 NOE upper distance constraints, 31 torsion angle constraints, three disulfide bonds, and 6 hydrogen bonds as input (TableI). The NOEs consisted of 208 intraresidue, 160 sequential, 74 medium range (1< i-j <5), and 103 long range interactions. The composition of the three disulfides was based on the previously determined pattern of disulfides in the homologous LB1 (19Bieri S. Djordjevic J.T. Daly N.L. Smith R. Kroon P.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13059-13065Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and LB5 (5Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) domains from the LDL receptor. Disulfides were accordingly specified for the cysteine pairs 6–19, 13–32, and 26–41. The final 40 best conformers produced by DYANA from an input of 100 initial structures were subject to energy minimization using the all-atom potential program AMBER 5.0 (20Case D.A. Pearlman D.A.

Energy minimization calculations were carried out both without and with calcium specifically coordinated. Because the four carboxylates and two backbone carbonyls that coordinate to calcium in LB5 are all present in CR8 in equivalent positions (carboxylates of Asp27, Asp31, Asp37, and Glu38 and carbonyls of Trp24 and Asp29 using CR8 numbering), similar ligation was used for CR8. Evidence concerning the coordination of the two backbone carbonyls was provided from 13C carbonyl chemical shifts of the tryptophan and amide 15N chemical shifts of the residues immediately C-terminal to Trp24 and Asp29. Thus the tryptophan carbonyl was strongly downfield shifted relative to the random coil value (177.9 ppm compared with 173.6 ppm, respectively) (22Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar, 23Biekofsky R.R. Martin S.R. Browne J.P. Bayley P.M. Feeney J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7617-7629Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and the amide nitrogens of Arg25 and Thr30 were also strongly downfield shifted about 7 ppm relative to random coil values (observed values of 127.3 and 121.0 ppm compared with random coil values of 120.8 and 114.2 ppm respectively (22Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar)). The chemical shift of the carbonyl of Asp29 was less definitive, being close to the expected random coil value. However, the large perturbation of the amide nitrogen of the adjacent threonine makes it likely that calcium does coordinate to the Asp29 carbonyl. Although the number of distance and angle violations did not differ very much between calculations carried out in the absence or presence of calcium coordination (Table I), the overall energy of the final structures obtained in the presence of calcium (mean of −362 kcal mol−1) was very much lower than in the absence of calcium (mean of −262 kcal mol−1) (Table I). The best 20 structures reported (Fig. 4) and the mean structure (Fig. 5) are therefore for structures calculated with calcium coordinated. For the 20 best structures only 1.3 distance violations >0.2 Å were found per structure, with no angle violations >10 ° (Table I).Figure 5Ribbon representation of the mean structure of CR8, based on the 20 best structures depicted in Fig. 4. The N terminus is at left, and the C terminus is atright. The two-stranded anti-parallel mini-β-sheet is shown in blue, and the one and a quarter turn α-helix is shown in yellow/ochre.

The three disulfides are shown asstraight lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The final set of 20 best structures (Fig. 4) and mean structure (Fig. 5) can be roughly described as formed from a Greek Ω in which the top of the loop has been folded backwards and down. This gives two loops, one on the left and one one the right. Each loop is held together by a disulfide between front and back, with a third disulfide holding the two loops together at the top. The left-hand loop contains a small two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet, and the left- and right-hand loops are linked at the bottom through a short α-helix. Most of the structure is very well defined, with rmsd for the backbone of 0.52 Å for residues 6 to 41 (Table I). This increases to 1.34 Å when all heavy atoms are included for this region. The N-terminal 5 residues and C termini 3 residues are only poorly defined and so cause large increases in rmsd for both backbone (2.10 Å) and heavy atoms (2.44 Å). This is not surprising because both ends act as linkers to the next domains in intact LRP and presumably must show some conformational flexibility. In addition residues 1 and 2 (Gly and Ser, respectively) are not part of CR8, being present as a consequence of the means of expressing and purifying the domain. Detailed inspection of the best low energy structures (Figs. 4 and 5) shows that residues His7–Glu10 form a β-turn structure. The amide proton of residue Glu10 exchanges slowly and thus appears to be involved in a hydrogen bond. This residue is followed by a short two-strand anti-parallel β-sheet formed by residues Phe11–Cys13 and residues Leu18–Ile20. Strong sequential dαN and cross-strand dNN, dαN, and dαa NOEs could be observed in this β-sheet. The amide protons of Phe11 and Ile20 also exchange slowly and thus appear to form hydrogen bonds with each other. This mini-sheet is followed by a one and a quarter turn α-helix from residues Pro21–Arg25. NOE cross-peaks were observed in 15N NOESY-HSQC between the Pro21α-proton and the Trp24 amide proton and between the Leu22 α-proton and the Arg25 amide proton. The amide protons of residues Trp24 and Arg25exchanged slowly, consistent with hydrogen bond formation to the carbonyls of Pro21 and Leu22, respectively. Residues Phe11 and Ile20, which are strongly conserved in LRP repeats and also present in LB5 from LDL receptor, form a small hydrophobic core together with Leu18 and Leu22. The calcium-binding site is composed entirely of ligands from the right-hand loop of the structure (Fig.6). Because the front and back parts of the loop do not form a β-sheet with one another, which might stabilize the structure (in contrast to the situation in the left-hand loop of the domain (Fig. 5)), it is understandable why calcium binding serves to rigidify the conformation of this and other complement-like domains (5Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 8Dolmer K. Huang W. Gettins P.G.W.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1662-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, the calcium bridges the front and back parts of the loop (Asp37 and Glu38 in front and Asp27, Asp29, and Asp31 in the back) and holds them together and, at the same time, tethers the loop to the α-helix that links the left and right loops, through the carbonyl of Trp24. The simultaneous neutralization by the positively charged calcium of multiple negatively charged residues, which would otherwise repel one another, would further help to stabilize this single structure. A potentially significant difference between LB5 and CR8 is that the glycine that coordinates the calcium in LB5, through its carbonyl, is an aspartate in CR8. Although chemical shift evidence strongly suggests that Asp29 also coordinates calcium through its carbonyl, it is also possible that the aspartate carboxyl could act as a calcium ligand, either in addition to the other four carboxyls or in place of one of them. Energy minimizations carried out with this side chain as a seventh ligand resulted in no significant improvement in the energy of the structure (data not shown), so this must remain speculative. In the region between the first and last of the six cysteines, LB5 is one residue shorter than CR8 (Fig. 1): an arginine inserted at position 14. Despite this insertion, there is overall a very high degree of structural similarity between the two proteins (Fig.7 and TableII). Thus the rmsd for the backbone of the whole structure, excluding residues beyond the end cysteines (residues 6–41) is 1.45 or 1.34 Å, depending on whether comparison is made with the lowest energy CR8 structure or the mean structure, respectively. If the left- and right-hand loops are considered separately, these comparisons further improve substantially. The left-hand “β-sheet loop” (residues 6–23) shows 1.20 Å rmsd between the two structures, and the calcium-binding loop (residues 24–41) shows even smaller rmsd of 0.90 Å. This high degree of similarity is despite very high variability of the primary structure, when cysteines and calcium coordinating ligands are excluded (Fig. 1). It is therefore likely that in overall fold, all of the complement-like domains in LRP and the LDL receptor will be very similar. Given the major differences in ligand specificity of LRP and the LDL receptor, the basis for these differences must therefore lie in the different residues that are presented on the surface.Table IIComparison of the structures of CR8 and LB5rmsd of mean CR8 structure compared with structure of LB5ÅWhole structure (5–42)aResidues 5–42 represent the entire region of LB5 for which coordinates were deposited.

Graphics. 1996; 14: 52-55Crossref Scopus (6490) Google Scholar). Two different proposals have been made to explain the binding of protein ligands to complement-like repeats of proteins of the LDL receptor family. One is that clusters of basic residues on the ligand interact with acidic residues on the receptor (2Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), recognizing the four acidic residues that are almost completely conserved in all of these repeats and that a cluster of basic residues has been shown to be required for binding of apoE to the LDL receptor (2Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The second is that hydrophobic interactions play a more important role (5Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), because most of the conserved acidic residues present in the C-terminal parts of these domains are involved in calcium binding and would therefore not be available to bind basic residues on the protein ligands. Both of these proposals are perhaps too one-sided and assume a common binding mode for all ligands to receptors from this family. Instead, it should be recognized that because most residues in these repeats that are neither cysteines nor putative calcium ligands will be on the surface of these small domains, the high variability of sequence between different domains will result in unique surfaces for each domain and corresponding unique ligand specificities. This is well illustrated by a comparison of the face of LB5 proposed to be a ligand-binding face (5Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) with the equivalent face of CR8 (Fig.8). Very different charge densities are found in these two domains. These arise from substantial differences in residues that occur on this face. The most notable differences are as follows, using the numbering for each domain given in Fig. 1: Phe8 in LB5 is Asp9 in CR8; Arg14in CR8 is an insertion; Ser21 of LB5 is Arg23in CR8; Glu37 of LB5 is Lys39 in CR8; and Ala40 in LB5 is Glu42 in CR8. These represent changes from acidic to basic, from polar to positively charged, from hydrophobic to negatively charged, and, for Arg14 of CR8, an addition of a positive residue. CR8 is not atypical in regard to these differences between pairs of complement-like domains. There are thus major differences in composition of equivalent residues in two other domains of known structure from the LDL receptor, LB1 and LB2 (Table III), and differences in the resulting contour surface and charge density (Fig. 8), again despite very similar backbone folds. This further emphasizes that from the point of view of understanding receptor-ligand interactions involving this family, the structure of each interacting domain must be specifically considered and therefore be available by x-ray and/or NMR means.Table IIIComparison of selected residues on the hydrophobic face of LB5 with residues in CR8, LB1, and LB2 that appear on the same face and are structurally equivalentResidueaResidues have been selected from the face of LB5 shown in Fig 8, with residues in other domains taken from sequence alignment.

No significant changes occur in expression of the genes coding for the angiotensin converting enzyme or the major pressor-mediating receptor for angiotensin, but plasma renin concentration in the mice having only one copy of the angiotensinogen gene is greater than twice wild-type. This increase is mediated primarily by a modest increase in the proportion of renal glomeruli producing renin in their juxtaglomerular apparatus and by four times wild-type numbers of renin-producing cells along afferent arterioles of the glomeruli rather than by up-regulating renin production in cells already committed to its synthesis.

An essential feature of complex organisms is the ability to maintain near constancy of their internal environments. Homeostasis is maintained by the operation of sophisticated systems that permit desirable physiological changes in biological variables, but that also act homeostatically if external factors cause undesirable changes in the variables. Genetic heterogeneity, such as is inherent to all outbred species including humans, also tends to cause variation in the internal environment. Yet the extent and types of homeostatic changes induced by naturally occurring genetic differences have not received much attention. We have recently been carrying out experiments aimed at identifying genes whose quantitative expression affects an important biological variable, blood pressure. To this end, we have used gene targeting in mice to alter the number of functional copies of several candidate genes, and so to produce systematic changes in their expression of the same order of magnitude as those occurring naturally in humans. Since the resulting mice are in other respects wild-type, their homeostatic systems are intact, and the mice can be used to investigate what compensations have been induced by the genetically determined differences in expression of the “titrated” genes. Because the causative genetic changes are life long, any induced compensations are categorically comparable with the lifelong adjustments that individual humans make in adjusting to the genetic heterogeneity inherent to our species. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) 1The abbreviations used are: RAS, renin-angiotensin system; AGT, angiotensinogen; AngI, angiotensin I; AngII, angiotensin II; JGA, juxtaglomerular apparatus; ACE, Angiotensin-converting enzyme; RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s) 1The abbreviations used are: RAS, renin-angiotensin system; AGT, angiotensinogen; AngI, angiotensin I; AngII, angiotensin II; JGA, juxtaglomerular apparatus; ACE, Angiotensin-converting enzyme; RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s) is critical for controlling blood pressure and salt balance in mammals. Angiotensinogen (AGT) is the sole source of angiotensin II (AngII), the major active peptide of the system. AGT is synthesized primarily in the liver and is secreted constitutively into the blood stream. It is the substrate for renin, a highly specific protease whose only known substrate is AGT. The majority of renin synthesis and secretion into the blood stream in normal mature animals is by modified smooth muscle cells in the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) of the kidney. The action of renin on AGT produces the decapeptide angiotensin I (AngI), which has no significant cardiovascular activity. Angiotensin-converting enzyme, ACE, a dipeptidase present in the blood stream as a circulating protein and in tissues as a membrane bound protein, converts AngI to the vasoactive octapeptide AngII. Genetic heterogeneity has been demonstrated at the angiotensinogen locus in humans (1Jeunemaitre X. Soubrier F. Kotelevtsev Y.V. Lifton R.P. Williams C.S. Charru A. Hunt S.C. Hopkins P.N.

A. 1995; 92: 2735-2739Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) quantitative differences in expression in mice of the angiotensinogen gene (Agt) have been shown to directly cause modest changes in blood pressure. Here we explore the long term homeostatic adjustments that occur in mice attempting to restore their blood pressures to normal in the face of inheriting below normal expression of the angiotensinogen gene (Agt). Except as indicated, all mice used were F1 hybrids between the inbred strains 129 and B6 with or without a disruptive mutation in the 129-derived copy of the Agt gene. The mutation in the Agt gene was generated in embryonic stem cells from the substrain 129/OlaHsd (5Simpson E.M. Linder C.C. Sargent E.E. Davisson M.T. Mobraaten L.E. Sharp J.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Prior to the matings to produce the F1 hybrids, the Agt gene mutation had been maintained for several generations on the closely related substrain 129/J. The mice were fed regular chow and handled following the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals. Blood samples were rapidly withdrawn from the descending aorta of mice after exposure to an atmosphere of CO2 (less than 1 min from loss of consciousness to the end of collection). The blood was collected into ice-cold microcentrifuge tubes containing EDTA and was immediately centrifuged to isolate plasma. Plasma AGT and (active) renin concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay as described previously (4Kim H.-S. Krege J.H. Kluckman K.D. Hagaman J.R. Hodgin J.B. Best C.F. Jennette J.C.

Plasma prorenin concentrations were determined after conversion to active renin by the trypsin-Sepharose 4B method (6Sealey J.E. Clin. Chem. 1991; 37: 1811-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). ACE activity was measured by the cleavage of a chromogenic tripeptide (7Krege J.H. John S.W.M. Langenbach L.L. Hodgin J.B.

Blood handling and radioimmunoassays followed published methods (8Hermann K. Ganten D. Unger T. Bayer C. Lang R.E. Clin.

Peptides (Elmsford). 1991; 12: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Peptides were extracted with ethanol as described in the assay procedure from the Nichols Institute (San Juan Capistrano, CA) using 600 μl of plasma pooled from three individuals matched by genotype and gender. The extracted peptide samples were divided into three equal portions and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Single portions were used for measurement of AngI, AngII, or bradykinin. Recoveries of each peptide at completion of the extraction procedure were determined by 1125-labeled tracers to be approximately 80%. By using highly specific monoclonal antibodies for the measurements, the radioimmunoassays could be carried out without further separations. The radioimmunoassays were performed with commercially available kits for AngI (DuPont), AngII (Nichols), and bradykinin (Peninsula, Belmont, CA). Tissues were rapidly dissected after withdrawing blood. Total RNA was isolated conventionally (10Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal.

All of the fragments were subcloned into a Bluescript(KS) vector for in vitrotranscription (15Melton D.A. Krieg P. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinh K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (4054) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled antisense riboprobes were synthesized by the manufacturer's protocols using a MAXI scriptTM transcription kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Unlabeled sense RNAs were prepared with the same transcription system. The sense RNAs were gel-purified and stored at −70 °C. The procedure described by Azrolan and Breslow (16Azrolan N. Breslow J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1141-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications was used for RNase protection assay. All reactions were carried out in duplicate for each sample in all experimental groups. A standard curve was generated using sense RNAs. Primer preparation and primer extension analysis for the mouse renin genes were slightly modified versions of published procedures (17Field L.J. Gross K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The primer was a 38-mer oligonucleotide complementary to Ren-1 C mRNA from positions 1039 through 1076 of the cDNA sequence (19Kim W.S. Murakami K. Nakayama K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9480PubMed Google Scholar). We determined that the nucleotide sequence of this region is identical in the strain B6 Ren-1 c gene and the strain 129Ren-1 d and Ren-2 genes. Autoradiographic bands were quantitated with an NIH image computer program (version 1.55). Quantitative RT-PCR (20Paul M. Wagner J. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2058-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) was used to assess expression of the gene coding for the type 1A receptor for AngII. Total RNA from the kidney was reversely transcribed to cDNA (21Wang A.M. Doyle M.W. Mark D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9717-9721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). A template plasmid for preparing the internal standard was constructed by making a 120-bp deletion (PvuII/DraI sites) in aPlmI/SacI fragment from the mouse type 1A receptor gene. PCR primers specific for the type 1A gene were designed from sequences of the type 1A and 1B genes (22Sasamura H. Hein L. Krieger J.E. Pratt R.E. Kobilka B.K. Dzau V.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar); they are 5′-ACGAGTCCCGGAATTACACG-3′ for the sense primer and 5′-GCGTGCTCATTTTCGTAGACAGG-3′ for the antisense primer. Competitive PCR was performed in the presence of an internal standard, yielding a 320-bp fragment. The RT product corresponding to the type 1A mRNA is 440 bp long. The amount of the full-length product relative to the internal standard was determined after hybridization to labeled full-length fragment as a probe. Immunohistochemical detection of renin was as described previously (23Gomez R.A. Lynch K.R. Chevalier R.L. Everett A.D. Johns D.W. Wilfong N. Peach M.J. Carey R.M. Am. J.

Briefly, after deparaffinization, 7-μm kidney sections were incubated with a polyclonal renin antibody (1:10,000, gift from Dr. Tadashi Inagami, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). The high specificity and characterization of this renin antibody has been documented previously (25Naruse K. Takii Y. Inagami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7579-7583Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry was done with kidneys from the Agt one-copy and wild-type mice. Two to four sections per kidney were examined by direct microscopic visualization. The total number of glomeruli, the number with renin-positive JGA, and the number with renin-positive cells upstream of the JGA were counted in each section. The percentage of renin-positive JGA was determined as (the number of renin-positive JGA in all sections) × 100/(the total number of glomeruli observed). The number of cells positive for renin, including those in the JGA itself, along the afferent arterioles of glomeruli having upstream renin-positive cells was also counted in each section. The figures thus obtained from each slide were averaged for each animal. To determine the area of juxtaglomerular apparatuses in theAgt one-copy and wild-type mice, 10 random fields of each section were captured with a video camera. Every section was screened using the same magnification (× 400), and only the JGA with a classic donut-shaped outline were evaluated. All the images were studied with an image analysis software (MochaTM, version 1.02, Jandel Scientific). Using the manual measurement mode, the perimeter of each JGA was outlined, and its area was determined by summing the number of pixels contained within the outline. To determine the number of cells in the JGA that had been evaluated for area, the number of nuclei observed within the outlined perimeter was counted. To obtain an integrated view of the distribution of renin within the kidney, the entire renal arterial tree was dissected as described previously in rats and mice (26Casellas D. Dupont M. Kaskel F.J. Inagami T. Moore L.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F151-F156PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hilgers K.F. Reddi V. Krege J.H. Smithies O. Gomez R.A. Hypertension (Dallas). 1997; 29: 216-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and stained for renin. The distribution of renin within the kidney was classified as described previously (28Reddi V. Zaglul A. Pentz E.S. Gomez R.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 63-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a type I distribution, renin is present along the whole length of the afferent vessel. In type II, renin extends upstream from the glomerulus but does not occupy the whole length of the vessel. In type III, renin is present as rings along the afferent vessel. In type IV, renin is restricted to the classical juxtaglomerular localization. In type V, no renin is found in the arteriole. All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. The two-tailed t test was used for statistical evaluations. The experimental animals used for investigating long term homeostatic compensations in the RAS have a single functional copy of the Agt gene and one disrupted by gene targeting. We refer to them as Agt one-copy mice, and their blood pressures are about 8 mmHg (approximately 7%) below the pressures of wild-type mice with two copies of the gene (4Kim H.-S. Krege J.H. Kluckman K.D. Hagaman J.R. Hodgin J.B. Best C.F. Jennette J.C. Coffman T.M. Maeda N. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2735-2739Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Except when indicated, the mice studied were F1 progeny-derived from the two inbred strains 129 and C57BL/6 (B6) and so were genetically identical except for having different numbers of functional Agt genes. Because of this genetic uniformity, even small differences between the mice can be ascribed directly to the difference in Agt gene copy number. To determine what components are homeostatically adjusted in the Agtone-copy animals, the steady state concentrations of the major RAS protein components present in plasma were compared in theAgt one-copy animals and their wild-type controls. The resulting data, Table I and Fig.1 (below), show two major differences. First, the plasma AGT concentration in the Agt one-copy mice is markedly reduced, to 33–37% of the AGT concentration in the controls (p < 0.01), which is also significantly less than the 50% expected if the amount of protein were directly related to gene copy number (p < 0.01 versus 50%). A possible complication affecting this observation is that the functional Agt gene in the one-copy animals is derived from mouse strain B6, whereas the wild-type two-copy animals have one copy from strain B6 and one from strain 129. However, a comparison of AGT levels in wild-type inbred strain B6 and 129 mice shows that B6 mice have higher AGT levels (558 ± 30 AngI ng/ml/h, in six females) than do 129 mice (426 ± 11 AngI ng/ml/h, in six females), so that if strain differences in Agt gene expression persist in the F1 hybrids, the AGT concentration in theAgt one-copy animals should be even more than 50% of the wild-type F1 animals. We conclude that the plasma concentration of AGT shows no evidence of any compensatory increase in the Agtone-copy animals.Table IPlasma proteins and peptides in F1 Agt wild-type and F1 Agt one-copy miceMalesFemalesnAgtwtAgt one-copyAgt wtAgtone-copyAGT6498 ± 23164 ± 6 (33)ap < 0.01 versus wild-type.550 ± 14201 ± 16 (37)ap < 0.01 versus wild-type.Renin638 ± 185 ± 6 (222)bp < 0.001 versus wild-type.50 ± 4131 ± 12 (262)bp < 0.001 versus wild-type.Prorenin6244 ± 3572 ± 51 (234)ap < 0.01 versus wild-type.NDNDACE3400 ± 29360 ± 15 (90)cp = 0.15 versus wild-type.246 ± 15251 ± 11 (102)cp = 0.15 versus wild-type.AngI359 ± 334 ± 4 (58)bp < 0.001 versus wild-type.60 ± 245 ± 3 (75)bp < 0.001 versus wild-type.AngII323 ± 512 ± 1 (50)ap < 0.01 versus wild-type.18 ± 111 ± 2 (62)ap < 0.01 versus wild-type.Bradykinin394 ± 496 ± 2 (103)dp = 0.87 versus wild-type.70 ± 264 ± 1 (93)dp = 0.87 versus wild-type.AGT, renin, and prorenin: ng of AngI/ml/h.

Values in parentheses are percent relative to wild-type. n, number of animals; ND, not determined; wt, wild type. The second major difference is that, in marked contrast to the absence of any detectable compensation in AGT plasma concentration, the plasma renin concentration in the Agt one-copy animals is very significantly higher (240%) than in the wild-type controls (p < 0.001), indicating a marked homeostatic adjustment in this component of the RAS. In mice and humans, renin is secreted into the circulation by renin-producing cells partly as enzymatically inactive prorenin and partly as enzymatically active renin (29Sealey J.E. Atlas S.A. Laragh J.H. Endocr. Rev. 1980; 1: 365-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The observed homeostatic increase in plasma renin could therefore be partly or wholly the consequence of a change in the proportion of the secreted protein in the active versus inactive form of renin. To investigate this possibility, we determined the plasma concentration of prorenin inAgt one-copy and in wild-type animals as well as the concentration of (active) renin. The plasma prorenin concentration in the Agt one-copy male animals was significantly higher (234%; p < 0.01) than in the wild-type controls (Table I). This increase in plasma prorenin is virtually identical to that of the plasma active renin, so that the same ratio of prorenin and active renin is observed in Agt one-copy and wild-type mice. We conclude that a change in the ratio of these two products is not part of the homeostatic adjustment made in the Agt one-copy mice. To determine the net effect of the observed increase in plasma renin concentration combined with the observed decrease in plasma AGT concentration, we compared the steady state concentrations of AngI inAgt one-copy and wild-type mice. The results show that theAgt one-copy animals have AngI levels that are 58% and 75% of wild-type in males and females, respectively. Thus the combined effect of the two changes is a partial but not complete restoration of the AngI concentrations to the wild-type level (p < 0.001 for one-copy versus wild-type), albeit at the expense of decreasing the steady state concentration of AGT below 50% of wild-type. An additional possible means of compensating for the less than normal AGT and AngI plasma levels in the one-copy animals would be via a homeostatically induced increase in the level of the converting enzyme ACE. Measurements of serum ACE activities (Table I), however, show no significant differences (p = 0.15) between theAgt one-copy mice and the wild-type controls. An additional indicator of possible changes in ACE function is the plasma bradykinin concentration, since this octapeptide is destroyed by the enzyme. We found that the bradykinin levels were not different between theAgt one-copy mice and the wild-type mice (p= 0.87). Thus we conclude that homeostatic compensation has not been induced at the level of the converting enzyme or of the bradykinin peptide. The major effector peptide of the RAS is the octapeptide AngII. A measure of changes in the net status of the circulating arm of the system can therefore be obtained by comparing the steady state plasma concentrations of AngII in Agt one-copy and wild-type mice. The resulting data show that plasma AngII in the Agtone-copy males and females are, respectively, 50% and 62% of the levels in the wild-type animals. These levels are significantly less than wild-type (p < 0.01), indicating that homeostasis is incomplete, as is reflected by the residual differences in blood pressure between Agt one-copy and wild-type animals. In summary, (Fig. 1), measurements of the expression of the protein and peptide components of the endocrine RAS show clear evidence that a major homeostatic compensation occurs in plasma renin concentrations in response to a genetic reduction in Agt gene expression. Other components of the system either show no changes or have changes that appear to be passive and secondary to the genetic reduction in AGT levels and the consequent homeostatic increase in renin. The final result is a steady state concentration of AngII in Agtone-copy animals that is still significantly less than normal. To ascertain whether the changes seen in the circulating protein components of the RAS are present at the level of transcriptional products, we used an RNase protection assay to determine the amounts of the relevant mRNAs in tissues that make the largest contribution to the plasma inAgt one-copy and wild-type animals. The major site of synthesis of AGT secreted into blood is the liver (30Nasjletti A. Masson G.M.C. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1971; 49: 931-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which also contains the highest abundance of AGT mRNA. Fig.2A presents the data for AGT mRNA inAgt one-copy and wild-type F1 males and females and in strain B6 and 129 inbred wild-type males. More mRNA is present in the female mice than in the males (a disparity also observed in the plasma AGT). But regardless of gender the liver AGT mRNA levels inAgt one-copy animals are clearly reduced compared with those in the wild-type animals (54% in males; 53% in females;p < 0.001). Recollecting that the single functionalAgt gene in the one-copy animals is derived from strain B6 and noting from Fig. 2 A that liver AGT mRNA levels in strain B6 are 1.2 times the corresponding levels in strain 129, we conclude that the liver AGT mRNA data agree with the plasma protein data in indicating no homeostatic compensation in the Agtone-copy mice in the transcription of the remaining functionalAgt gene in the primary tissue of AGT synthesis. The high steady state plasma renin (and prorenin) concentrations observed in Agt one-copy animals suggest a substantially increased level of renin gene transcription. Fig. 2 Bpresents the relevant data and shows that the steady state renin mRNA contents of the kidneys of the Agt one-copy males and females are respectively 182 and 165% of the wild-type two-copy controls (p < 0.001). Thus a major part of the homeostatic adjustment in renin production is a consequence of an increase in amount of renin mRNA. Since the steady state serum ACE activities of the experimental and control mice do not differ significantly, we expected to see no differences in the ACE mRNA levels in tissues in which ACE is synthesized. The lungs are a major site of ACE synthesis in both sexes (31Ng K.K.F. Vane J.R. Nature. 1967; 275: 762-766Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In addition, a truncated form of ACE is synthesized in the testis from a testis-specific promoter (32Howard T. Balogh R. Overbeek P. Bernstein K.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 C presents data showing that the ACE mRNA contents of the lungs of Agtone-copy males and females are slightly increased (108 and 105%) relative to their two-copy controls, but the difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.09). The ACE mRNA level in the testis was also slightly higher (data not shown), but again the difference was not significant (108% wild-type,p = 0.65). Thus there is no evidence for significant homeostatic compensation at the level of ACE mRNA. In the mouse, three receptors (types 1A, 1B, and 2) control the cellular and physiologic actions of AngII (22Sasamura H. Hein L. Krieger J.E. Pratt R.E. Kobilka B.K. Dzau V.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 33Whitebread S. Mele M. Kamber B. deGasparo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). The results of administering receptor antagonists that specifically block the actions of either the type 1 or the type 2 receptors establish that blood pressure changes are chiefly executed by the type 1 receptors (34Timmermans P.B.M.W.M. Wong P.C. Chiu A.T. Herblin W.F. Benfield P. Carini D.J. Lee R.J. Wexler R.R. Saye J.A.M. Smith R.D. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 205-251PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic experiments disrupting the genes coding for the type 1A receptor gene (35Ito M. Oliverio M.I. Mannon P.J. Best C.F. Maeda N. Smithies O. Coffman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Another possible means of homeostatic adjustments in the face of a chronic decrease in blood pressure would therefore be to increase expression of the type 1A receptor. However, comparison of the type 1A receptor gene expression by RT-PCR (Fig.3) in Agt wild-type mice (lane 1) and the Agt one-copy mice (lane 2) revealed no detectable differences, although the same assay"

Both c-myb and v-myb have been useful in studying the development of hematopoietic cells, and much work has been devoted to analyzing their properties and regulation.

Recently, the LZ motif has been reported to be required for proliferation of v-Myb-transformed monoblasts and for in vivo leukemogenicity of v-Myb (15Bartunek P. Karafiat V. Dvorakova M. Zahorova V. Mandikova S. Zenke M. Dvorak M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2939-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition to leucine zipper, other parts of v-Myb C terminus were also found to be important for the biological activities of the oncogene. 2M. Dvor̆áková, unpublished observations. All these domains are engaged in interactions with other proteins. Several interactions of Myb DBD and TA have been implicated in regulation of Myb functions in growth and differentiation. The interaction of c-Myb DBD with the EVES motifs of both p100 transcriptional coactivator and c-Myb itself down-regulates c-Myb activity (16Dash A.B. Orrico F.C. Ness S.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Similarly, the direct binding of c-Maf transcriptional activator to c-Myb DBD was found to repress Myb transcriptional activity and to inhibit Myb- and Ets1-dependent activation of CD13/APN transcription (17Hedge S.P. Kumar A. Kurschner C. Shapiro L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2729-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The Myb DBD was also found to interact with the retinoic acid receptor. This interaction appears to inhibit retinoic acid-dependent transactivation (18Pfitzner E. Kirfel J. Becker P. Rolke A. Schule R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5539-5544Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the interaction of C/EBPβ with v-Myb DBD positively affects Myb activity and results in synergistic activation of the mim-1 promoter by both proteins (19Mink S. Kerber U. Klempnauer K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1316-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Binding of Cyp-40 (20Leverson J.D. Ness S.A. Mol.

The Myb TA was found to interact with CBP (CREB-binding protein). This interaction results in activation of Myb transcriptional properties (22Oelgeschlager M. Janknecht R. Krieg J. Schreek S.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2939-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), were also found to associate with Myb LZ. No biological activity has been assigned to these interactions so far. In an attempt to detect and identify additional protein partners of v-Myb C terminus that could potentially affect biological activities of v-Myb, the v-Myb sequence downstream from transactivation domain was used in this work as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen applied to a human cDNA library. These experiments led to the isolation of ATBF1. ATBF1 gene was first identified in human hepatoma cells. Its protein product binds to and represses the activity of an AT-rich enhancer element of the human α-fetoprotein gene (26Morinaga T. Yasuda H. Hashimoto T. Higashio K. Tamaoki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6041-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). ATBF1, a vertebrate homologue of Drosophila ZfH 2 protein, is a 306-kDa protein containing 4 homeodomains, 17 zinc finger motifs, and a number of segments potentially involved in transcriptional regulation. More recently, its longer form, termed ATBF1A, was isolated (27Miura Y. Tam T. Ido A. Morinaga T. Miki T. Hashimoto T. Tamaoki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26840-26848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this work, it is shown that ATBF1 binds specifically to Myb proteins both in vitro and in vivo. Binding of ATBF1 to v-Myb can repress transcriptional activity of the oncoprotein in chicken fibroblasts. In this interaction, v-Myb amino acids 279–300 are involved and represent a novel protein-protein interaction interface through which Myb transcriptional activity can be regulated. We also describe the detection of chicken ATBF1 and point to the very high ATBF1 conservation between mammalian and avian species. Sf9 insect cells grown in SF 900 II (Life Technologies, Inc.) medium were used to produce v-Myb and c-Myb from recombinant baculovirus genomes (28Vranovsky K. Bartunek P. Cermakova V. Forstova J. Dvorak M. Doskocil J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 117: 233-235PubMed Google Scholar). Chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum, 2% chicken serum, and antibiotics. The bait molecule pB-137 was constructed by inserting the v-myb SalI-XbaI fragment (nucleotides 714–1163) in frame with GAL4 DNA-binding domain in pGBT9 (CLONTECH). In pB-85 bait, the shorter v-myb fragment (nucleotides 714–971) was used. The numbering of v-myb starts at the first coding nucleotide of the gag gene in AMV v-myb (29Bartunek P. Kozmik Z. Dvorak M. Virology. 1992; 190: 882-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To express various forms of ATBF1 fragment (encoded by the two-hybrid system-selected RX-28 plasmid) as GST fusion proteins inEscherichia coli, the following plasmids were prepared. Plasmid GST-AT438 was constructed by insertingEcoRI-HindIII fragment of ATBF1 from RX-28 intoEcoRI-Tth111I site of pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after converting HindIII and Tth111I into blunt ends by Klenow fragment. To make GST-AT175, GST-AT438 was used as a template in PCR reaction using the following primers: 5′-CGTGGGATCCACGGGAATTC-3′ and 5′-CTGGCTCTTCAGGGAGTTTC-3′. The amplified ATBF1 fragment was digested with BamHI and inserted into pGEX-3X digested with BamHI andSmaI; GST-AT139 and GST-AT81 were made by insertingBamHI-SmaI and BamHI-StuI fragments of GST-AT175 into BamHI-EcoRI site of pGEX-3X after converting EcoRI site into blunt end; in-frame deletions of BamHI-StuI fragment in GST-AT139 and GST-AT175 created GST-AT58 and GST-AT94, respectively. BamHI and StuI ends were partially filled to recreateBamHI site and maintain the reading frame. To express various v-myb proteins in TnT (Promega), the wild type v-myb EcoRI-XbaI fragment (nucleotides 360–1163) and its in-frame deletions, namely Δ721–750, Δ721–834, Δ835–900, and Δ904–933, were constructed in pGEM-4Z. For transient expression in CEFs, the full-length wild type (wt) or mutant AMV v-myb genes were inserted into pneo vector (30Lipsick J.S. Ibanez C.E. Baluda M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 267-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), creating pneo-wt v-myb, pneo-Δ835–900 v-myb, and pneo-L3,4A v-myb (15Bartunek P. Karafiat V. Dvorakova M. Zahorova V. Mandikova S. Zenke M. Dvorak M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2939-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), respectively. The pneo-Δv-myb vector containing no myb sequences was used as a control. Cytomegalovirus expression vector pKW-2T was used to express various ATBF1 constructs. To generate pKW-AT, an 8.6-kilobaseHindIII fragment of full-length ATBF1 from pCATBF1A (kindly donated by T. Morinaga; Ref. 31Yasuda H. Mizuno A. Tamaoki T. Morinaga T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used. In pKW-ΔMISAT, the Myb-interacting sequence (MIS) spanning amino acids 2426–2516 was deleted. In pKW-ATHA, three tandemly arranged hemagglutinin epitopes (HA) were attached in frame to the 3′ terminus of ATBF1. To measure transcriptional activities, four CAT reporter plasmids were used; 3xMRE-CAT contained three wild type mim-1a Myb recognition elements (15Bartunek P. Karafiat V. Dvorakova M. Zahorova V. Mandikova S. Zenke M. Dvorak M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2939-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); the SN0.5-CAT contained SmaI-NotI fragment of the chicken c-myb promoter (nucleotides −481 to −15 in Ref. 32Dvorak M. Urbanek P. Bartunek P. Paces V. Vlach J. Pecenka V. Arnold L. Travnicek M. Riman J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5651-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) in front of TATA box derived from herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene; the ATBF1 recognition element (AFE)-containing reporters, namely AFE SN0.5-CAT and AFEm SN0.5-CAT, contained the wild type or mutated AFE (31Yasuda H. Mizuno A. Tamaoki T. Morinaga T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, upstream from SN0.5 sequence. RSV-βGal plasmid has been described (15Bartunek P. Karafiat V. Dvorakova M. Zahorova V. Mandikova S. Zenke M. Dvorak M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2939-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All constructs were checked by restriction mapping or by sequencing. Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using the MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system (CLONTECH). The yeast strain HF7c was transformed with transcriptionally inert pB-85 construct using lithium acetate method. Cells that grew on synthetic medium lacking tryptophan were transformed with a HeLa cDNA library directionally cloned intoEcoRI-XhoI site of GAL4 activation domain vector pGAD GH. Approximately 1 × 106 yeast transformants were plated on 20 15-cm plates containing synthetic medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine, and including 10 mm3-aminotriazol. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 5 days. Two hundred growing individual Leu+, Trp+, His+ colonies were picked and purified on the same selection medium. Fifty well growing purified colonies were transferred to the filter paper and assayed for β-galactosidase. Five colonies were positive. Plasmids containing human cDNAs were isolated, and cDNA inserts were sequenced. ATBF1-containing plasmid (RX-28) was co-transformed with the bait construct or control plasmids (see “Results”) into SFY526 cells to verify the specificity of two-hybrid assay. Logarithmically growing bacterial cultures (10 ml) harboring different GST-ATBF1 constructs were induced for 1 h with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, sonicated briefly on ice in 1 ml of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Fluka), and 50 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma), and soluble fraction was incubated with 25 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 10 min at 4 °C. Agarose beads were washed four times with the above lysis buffer and then incubated in 200 μl of lysis buffer with insect cell lysates containing v-Myb or c-Myb. Lysates were prepared by sonication of 1 × 104 insect cells in lysis buffer, and soluble fraction was used. Alternatively, 20,000 cpm of35S-labeled in vitro synthesized (TnT) Myb proteins were used. After rocking at 4 °C for 2 h, beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography or Western blotting. Transient transfections were performed by a calcium phosphate precipitation method (33Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Four μg of v-Myb-expressing plasmids, 2 μg of reporter plasmids, 5 μg of ATBF1 expression plasmids, 1.5 μg of internal control RSV-βGal plasmid, and pBluescript carrier DNA up to 25 μg were co-transfected into approximately 7 × 105 CEF/10-cm Petri dish. Empty expression vectors pKW-2T or pneo-Δv-myb were used as controls. Forty-eight hours later, cells were harvested and nuclear or whole cell extracts were prepared. CAT activity was determined in whole cell extracts by CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), normalized for β-galactosidase activity, and plotted as -fold activation. The -fold activation represents CAT values obtained with v-Myb expression vectors divided by CAT values obtained with pneo-Δv-myb vector. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, nuclear extracts of transfected cells were prepared as described (34Arsura M. Deshpande A. Hann S.R. Sonenshein G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6702-6709Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In these experiments, pKW-ATHA was used. Nuclear proteins were extracted from 2 × 106 CEF transiently expressing v-Myb and ATBF1-HA using salt and detergent buffer essentially as described (34Arsura M. Deshpande A. Hann S.R. Sonenshein G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6702-6709Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody was used to immunoprecipitate ATBF1-HA, according to the published protocol (35Maheswaran S. Lee H. Sonenshein G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1147-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The antigen-antibody complexes were collected on a protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed, and analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE. For Western blots, the fractionated proteins were transferred onto Hybond™ ECL™ nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and v-Myb was detected using myb-specific polyclonal antibody. The blots were developed using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Two μg of total RNA prepared (36Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) from the whole chicken embryo was reverse transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cDNA was used to amplify a chicken ATBF1 fragment. Degenerated PCR primers were derived from homeodomain HD2 (5′-ACN JGN TTY ACN GAY TAY CAR-3′) and zinc finger motif Z12 (5′-RCA YTT YTT RCA XXX RTA RTT-3′) that are well conserved inDrosophila ZfH-2 and mammalian ATBF1. PCR was performed as follows: 5 min at 94 °C; 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 55 °C, 1 min at 72 °C for 35 cycles, and then 1 μl of the PCR reaction was used for reamplification with HD3 (5′-GTN CAR GTN TGG TTY CAR AAY-3′) and Z12 primers. The final PCR product (138 base pairs) was cloned into pCRTMII vector (Invitrogen) to yield pCR-chATBF1, sequenced, and used as a probe for RNase protection assay. pCR-chATBF1 was linearized byXhoI and transcribed by SP6 polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the presence of [α-32P]GTP to produce radioactive 257-base pair fragment protecting 138 nucleotides of ATBF1 mRNA. As a referential probe, chicken actin was used. RNA probes were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and hybridized to 10 μg of total cellular RNA in 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, 80% formamide, 0.4 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA at 65 °C overnight. After digestion with 5 μg/ml RNase A and 50 units/ml RNase T1 at 37 °C for 1 h, samples were analyzed in 6% polyacrylamide-urea gel and detected by autoradiography. In an attempt to isolate a protein(s) interacting with v-Myb C terminus, the MATCHMAKER yeast two-hybrid system was used. In this system, the bait molecule pB-137 containing v-mybnucleotides 714–1163 fused in frame to GAL4 DBD and carrying the gene for TRP1 bound to regulatory regions of HIS3 andlacZ reporter genes in HF7c cells auxotrophic for Trp, Leu, and His. The plasmids containing cDNA (HeLa) library fused to GAL4 TA and carrying the gene for LEU2 were introduced into bait-containing cells and transformants were selected on Trp-, Leu-, and His-lacking plates. Interaction of GAL4 TA/cDNA encoded protein with the bait protein resulted in HIS3 transcription and growth of transformants on selective medium. Growing colonies were subsequently screened for the expression of the second lacZ reporter gene. The pB-137 construct alone, however, activated bothHIS3 and lacZ genes in HF7c cells. Since v-Myb leucine zipper region has previously been shown to activate transcription in yeast (37Seneca S. Punyammalee B. Sureau A. Perbal B. Dvorak M. Crabeel M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2335-2342PubMed Google Scholar), the C-terminal part of LZ was deleted from pB-137 yielding transcriptionally inactive pB-85 (v-mybnucleotides 714–971 fused to GAL4 DBD). Upon introduction of GAL4 TA/cDNAs into pB-85 containing cells, 1 × 106transformants were obtained, 50 of which reproducibly grew well in the absence of histidine. Among them five colonies were also positive forlacZ expression. cDNA-containing plasmids were isolated from them and sequenced. One clone (RX-28) contained 440 C-terminal codons (amino acids 2345–2783) of human ATBF1 (Ref. 26Morinaga T. Yasuda H. Hashimoto T. Higashio K. Tamaoki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6041-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar; Fig.1 A). Four other positive clones carried inserts not homologous to any known sequence. To verify the interaction, the RX-28 plasmid was introduced into HF7c cells containing pB-85. In this case, all the transformed colonies exhibited both HIS + and LacZ +phenotype. Finally, instead of HF7c also SFY526 yeast strain was transfected with pB-85, pGBT9 (containing only GAL4 DBD), or pLAM (encodes human lamin C/GAL 4 DBD). LacZ expression appeared only when pB-85 and RX-28 were cotransfected, suggesting that Myb and ATBF1 fragments interact in yeast cells. To confirm the v-Myb-ATBF1 interaction observed in yeast cells, the ATBF1 sequence from RX-28 was expressed in bacteria as GST fusion protein from GST-AT 438 vector (Fig. 1 A) and bound to glutathione-agarose column. Ly-sates of Sf9 cells synthesizing either v-Myb or c-Myb were applied to the column, and retained proteins were analyzed by the Western blot procedure. As shown in Fig.1 B, both v-Myb and c-Myb proteins bound efficiently to GST-AT 438 (lanes 3 and 6), but not to GST alone (lanes 2 and 5). Smaller-sized proteins detected in lane 1 represent degradation products of c-Myb. Protein molecules larger than p48 v-Myb seen in lanes 4,5, and 6 represent irreversible reaction products of v-Myb, often generated during prolonged manipulation with v-Myb preparations. In order to delineate the ATBF1 interaction domain, six deletion mutants fused to GST were prepared. The GST-AT 175, GST-AT 139, GST-AT 81, GST-AT 94, and GST-AT 58 constructs (schematically represented in Fig.1 A) were expressed in bacteria (Fig. 1 D) and used for the binding assay with v-Myb as above. Fig. 1 C shows that only the constructs GST-AT 438, GST-AT 175, and GST-AT 94 bind Myb oncoprotein. Similar results were obtained with c-Myb (not shown). Thus, the ATBF1 amino acids in GST-AT 94 represent the minimal interaction domain where the C-terminal 37-amino acid region (amino acids 2484–2520) referred to as ATBF1-MIS is necessary for binding the full-length Myb proteins in vitro. This proline-rich region covers the C-terminal part of the third ATBF1 PQ box. In order to define the Myb sequences engaged in ATBF1 binding, several v-Myb deletion mutants were prepared. As shown in Fig.2 A, v-Myb devoid of DNA-binding domain with short in-frame deletions covering the bait fragment was used. The [35S]methionine-labeled Myb proteins (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–6) were mixed with glutathione-agarose-bound GST-AT 438. Labeled proteins retained on the agarose were revealed by electrophoresis (Fig. 2 B, lanes 7–12). Smaller sized forms of Myb proteins were probably initiated at an internal ATG codon located 96 nucleotides downstream from the first ATG. None of the Myb proteins bound to the control GST column (data not shown). It has been observed that deletion of Myb amino acids 279–300 encoded by nucleotides 835–900 severely reduced binding to ATBF1 (lane 9). Identical results were obtained with agarose-bound GST-AT 175 (not shown). Since all the Myb mutants contain the LZ region active in protein-protein interactions (15Bartunek P. Karafiat V. Dvorakova M. Zahorova V. Mandikova S. Zenke M. Dvorak M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2939-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Favier D. Gonda T.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 305-311PubMed Google Scholar,25Gonda T.J. Favier D. Ferrao P. Macmillan E.M. Simpson R. Tavner F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 211: 99-109PubMed Google Scholar), the potential contribution of LZ to ATBF1 binding was assessed using the L3,4A v-Myb mutant. This mutation was shown to reduce binding of v-Myb LZ to other proteins (15Bartunek P. Karafiat V. Dvorakova M. Zahorova V. Mandikova S. Zenke M. Dvorak M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2939-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Favier D. Gonda T.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 305-311PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments mutation of Myb LZ, leucines 3 and 4 (Leu325 and Leu332) to alanines resulted in a significant decrease of binding to GST-AT 438 (lane 11) as well as to GST-AT 175 (not shown). Thus, the data indicate that there are two adjacent sequences in Myb, namely the amino acids 279–300 present in the bait molecule and also leucines L3 and L4 of the zipper domain, required for efficient binding of ATBF1in vitro. Previous experiments revealed the interaction between chicken Myb and human ATBF1 proteins. To substantiate further functional studies with these proteins, we searched for the existence, evolutionary conservation, and expression of ATBF1 homologue in chicken cells. Southern blot analysis of the chicken chromosomal DNA detected a set of restriction fragments that hybridized with the human ATBF1 probe at high stringency (Fig.3 A). Degenerated PCR primers, derived from ATBF1 sequence highly conserved in man andDrosophila, were than used for amplification of an ATBF1 fragment from the chicken embryo cDNA. The isolated cDNA fragment displayed very high homology with the human sequence. Additional upstream and downstream sequences were obtained by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and aligned with the human and murine ATBF1 sequences. The chicken fragment shown in Fig.3 B displayed 97% identity of amino acid and 84% conservation of nucleotide sequences (data not shown). Based on the sequence comparison of other chicken ATBF1 cDNA fragments covering approximately one third of mRNA, it can be assumed that the evolutionary conservation of human and chicken ATBF1 proteins is approximately 95%. 3P. Pajer, unpublished data. RNase protection analysis was conducted to characterize the distribution of ATBF1 mRNA in various chicken tissues, cultured v-Myb transformed primary monoblasts (AMV blasts), and CEF. As shown in Fig. 3 C, ATBF1 transcripts were detected in all samples examined. The threshold levels were found in CEF, while the highest expression was detected in spleen and brain. These results document the existence of chicken ATBF1 and substantiate functional studies with human ATBF1 and chicken v-Myb. Moreover, they show that chicken fibroblasts, which do not express endogenous Myb and synthesize only background amounts of ATBF1 mRNA, are suitable for Myb-ATBF1 co-expression experiments. To document the direct binding of transiently expressed full-length ATBF1 and v-Myb proteins in CEF, a co-immunoprecipitation experiment was performed using a hemagglutinin epitope-tagged ATBF1. CEF nuclear proteins were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-HA epitope antibody, and immunocomplexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blots were then developed with Myb-specific polyclonal antibody. As shown in Fig.4 A, v-Myb was detectable in anti-HA immunoprecipitates (lane 1). In the control experiment, where the identical procedure was applied to cells transfected only with v-Myb, no signal was obtained (lane 2). In order to assess whether ATBF1 can modulate transcriptional activity of v-Myb, both cDNAs were expressed in CEF in the presence of 3xMRE-CAT, the mim-1 MRE-based reporter. In these experiments, deletion mutants ATBF1-ΔMIS, Δ835–900 v-Myb and point mutant L3,4A v-Myb were also used to characterize the effect of protein regions required for ATBF1-Myb binding in vitro. Both ATBF1 and ATBF1-ΔMIS displayed a general inhibitory effect, as they reduced the basal activity of the reporter as well as the expression of internal control plasmids having lacZ gene placed under RSV-long terminal repeat or cytomegalovirus promoters. ATBF1 proteins also inhibited v-Myb-dependent activation of 3xMRE-CAT reporter. The full-length ATBF1 appeared to be a stronger inhibitor of v-Myb than ATBF1-ΔMIS, but both CAT values were so close to the background that it was hard to draw a reliable conclusion using them. Therefore, SN0.5-CAT reporter containing a chicken c-mybpromoter fragment (SN0.5) was used. Although there is no consensus MRE in the SN0.5, v-Myb binds to it in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay and activates the downstream reporter gene (CAT) by an order of magnitude stronger than multimerized mim-1 MRE sequences. 4M. Dvor̆ák, unpublished observations. With this reporter it was possible to demonstrate that full-length ATBF1 was a more efficient inhibitor than ATBF1-ΔMIS, as it reduced v-Myb activity to 65% of that observed in the presence of ATBF1-ΔMIS (Fig.4 B, a). Insertion of ATBF1 binding sequence (AFE) upstream from the SN0.5 fragment (AFE SN0.5-CAT reporter) resulted in a further reduction of v-Myb activity by full-length ATBF1 to 25% of that obtained with ATBF1-ΔMIS (Fig. 4 B, b). This effect appeared to be specifically dependent on ATBF1 binding site, since the point mutation in AFE (AFEm), known to abrogate ATBF1 binding (see AFE[IV] element in Ref. 32Dvorak M. Urbanek P. Bartunek P. Paces V. Vlach J. Pecenka V. Arnold L. Travnicek M. Riman J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5651-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), eliminated the increment of inhibition observed with AFE SN0.5-CAT (Fig. 4 B-c). The conclusion that ATBF1 inhibits v-Myb via direct interaction has been further supported by experiments with Δ835–900 v-Myb, the mutant lacking ATBF1 binding region found in pull-down experiments (see Fig.2 B, lane 9). This v-Myb mutant was inhibited to the same extent with both the ATBF1 and ATBF1-ΔMIS, independently of the presence of MIS (Fig. 4 B, d). The L3,4A mutant of the v-Myb leucine zipper was inhibited by ATBF1 and ATBF1-ΔMIS similarly as the wt v-Myb, suggesting that Myb LZ may not participate in down-regulation of Myb transcriptional activity (Fig.4 B, e). In conclusion, the data show that ATBF1 can exert transcriptional repression of v-Myb, which is dependent on the presence of interacting amino acid sequences 279–300 (encoded by nucleotides 835–900) and 2484–2520 (encoded by nucleotides 7581–7689 in Ref. 26Morinaga T. Yasuda H. Hashimoto T. Higashio K. Tamaoki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6041-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) in v-Myb and ATBF1, respectively. The aim of this work was to identify a protein(s) interacting with v-Myb C terminus, as this part of the oncoprotein is involved in a subset of v-Myb activities, namely in the in vitro growth of transformed monoblasts as well as in the dynamics of the leukemic process in chicks (15Bartunek P. Karafiat V. Dvorakova M. Zahorova V. Mandikova S. Zenke M. Dvorak M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2939-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).2 It was impossible, however, to use the entire v-Myb C terminus as a bait in the two-hybrid system due to the presence of the leucine zipper motif, which behaves as transcription activating domain in yeast (37Seneca S. Punyammalee B. Sureau A. Perbal B. Dvorak M. Crabeel M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2335-2342PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of C-terminal portion of leucine zipper (including L3, L4, and L5) provided a transcriptionally inactive bait pB-85, which was then used to search for proteins interacting with Myb sequences upstream from the leucine L3. Screening of a HeLa cDNA library resulted in the isolation of the 1.2-kilobase fragment encoding C terminus of the complex homeodomain/zinc finger protein, ATBF1 (26Morinaga T. Yasuda H. Hashimoto T. Higashio K. Tamaoki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6041-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which bound efficiently not only the bait fragment, but also full-length v-Myb and c-Myb proteins in vitro. In co-transfection transactivation assays, ATBF1 behaved as both the general and v-Myb specific repressor of transcription. In ATBF1, a proline-rich sequence represented by amino acids 2484–2520 was found to be crucial for interaction with Myb proteins and was therefore designated as MIS. This sequence was required for in vitro and in vivo interaction and brought about the ATBF1 repressive effect on v-Myb transactivation. No other functional data on the MIS-containing part of ATBF1 protein are available to date. On the other hand, two v-Myb sequences were required for an efficientin vitro binding of ATBF1: the 22-amino acid region 279–300 (encoded by nucleotides 835–900) and leucines L3 and L4 of v-Myb LZ (not present in the bait molecule). Only amino acids 279–300, however, appeared to mediate the ATBF1 inhibitory effect on v-Myb transactivation, since their deletion eliminated the Myb-specific repression effect of ATBF1. No function has been assigned to this part of v-Myb yet. Our data indicate, however, that it contributes to the transcriptional activity of the oncoprotein, since its deletion reduced v-Myb transactivation to one third (as shown in Fig. 4 B,d). In biological assays, the Δ835–900 v-Myb mutant (in which amino acids 279–300 are missing) displayed reduced transformation and leukemia formation abilities compared with wild type v-Myb.2 Thus, v-Myb amino acids 279–300 can be viewed as a part of v-Myb transactivation domain that might activate transcription machinery through interaction with its factor(s). Binding of ATBF1 to Myb could prevent such interaction and result in down-regulation of v-Myb transcriptional activity similarly as deletion of this region. In agreement with that, ATBF1 did not show specific repression of the Δ835–900 v-Myb mutant. On the contrary, leucines L3 and L4 of v-Myb LZ do not mediate ATBF1 inhibition of v-Myb transactivation, since mutation of leucines to alanines (that eliminated Myb-ATBF1 bindingin vitro) had no effect on ATBF1 inhibitory activity. This mutation of leucines, which partially inactivates the growth promoting and leukemogenic abilities of v-Myb (15Bartunek P. Karafiat V. Dvorakova M. Zahorova V. Mandikova S. Zenke M. Dvorak M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2939-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), does not inhibit but rather activates transcriptional activity of v-Myb (Ref. 15Bartunek P. Karafiat V. Dvorakova M. Zahorova V. Mandikova S. Zenke M. Dvorak M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2939-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar; Fig.4 B, e). Thus, v-Myb LZ leucines do not seem to take part in v-Myb interaction with the transcription machinery and could be involved in a regulatory mechanism not directly connected with transcription. If this is the case, ATBF1 could modulate also this Myb activity. Alternatively, leucines of v-Myb LZ would only stabilize thein vitro binding of ATBF1. Further work is necessary to address this question. In addition to v-Myb specific inhibitory activity mediated by amino acids 2484–2520 and 279–300 in ATBF1 and v-Myb, respectively, ATBF1 displayed a general inhibitory effect on expression of different reporters. This supports a view of ATBF1 as a transcriptional inhibitor with a domain(s) of general effect and domains specific for particular tissue-specific transcription factors. Recently, a related member of the ZfH family, ZEB, the vertebrate homologue of Drosophila ZfH-1, was shown to block transcriptional activity of c-Myb (38Postigo A.A. Sheppard A.M. Mucenski M.L. Dean D.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3924-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Since our results suggest that c-Myb is likely to be affected by ATBF1 as well, the ZfH/ATBF1 family and Myb proteins might cooperate in regulation of development of specific tissues. The very high evolutionary conservation of the chicken ATBF1 and its high expression in spleen and brain tissues, where also c-Myb is expressed, support such a view. We thank Dr. C̆. Vlc̆ek for a part of sequencing work and Dr. Š. Takác̆ová for editorial assistance. We are indebted to Dr. P. Bartu˙nĕk for the help with preparation of graphic files."
https://openalex.org/W2061970520,"The general transcription factor TFIIB plays a crucial role in selecting the transcription initiation site in yeast. We have analyzed the human homologs of TFIIB mutants that have previously been shown to affect transcription start site selection in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Despite the distinct mechanisms of transcription start site selection observed in S. cerevisiae and humans, the role of TFIIB in this process is similar. However, unlike their yeast counterparts, the human mutants do not show a severe defect in supporting either basal transcription or transcription stimulated by an acidic activator in vitro. Transient transfection analysis revealed that, in addition to a role in transcription start site selection, human TFIIB residue Arg-66 performs a critical function in vivo that is bypassed in vitro. Furthermore, although correct transcription start site selection is dependent upon an arginine residue at position 66 in human TFIIB, innate function in vivo is determined by the charge of the residue alone. Our observations raise questions as to the evolutionary conservation of TFIIB and uncover an additional function for TFIIB that is required in vivo but can be bypassedin vitro. The general transcription factor TFIIB plays a crucial role in selecting the transcription initiation site in yeast. We have analyzed the human homologs of TFIIB mutants that have previously been shown to affect transcription start site selection in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Despite the distinct mechanisms of transcription start site selection observed in S. cerevisiae and humans, the role of TFIIB in this process is similar. However, unlike their yeast counterparts, the human mutants do not show a severe defect in supporting either basal transcription or transcription stimulated by an acidic activator in vitro. Transient transfection analysis revealed that, in addition to a role in transcription start site selection, human TFIIB residue Arg-66 performs a critical function in vivo that is bypassed in vitro. Furthermore, although correct transcription start site selection is dependent upon an arginine residue at position 66 in human TFIIB, innate function in vivo is determined by the charge of the residue alone. Our observations raise questions as to the evolutionary conservation of TFIIB and uncover an additional function for TFIIB that is required in vivo but can be bypassedin vitro.

Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). The GTFs assemble in an ordered fashion, beginning with the binding of TFIID to the TATA element present at most promoters. TFIID is itself a multiprotein complex of which one component mediates binding to the TATA element (TATA-binding protein; TBP). TFIIA joins the forming PIC, followed by TFIIB. The complex is then able to incorporate TFIIF/pol II, and assembly is completed by further GTFs, including TFIIE and TFIIH. This pathway of PIC assembly has been challenged by evidence that some GTFs may exist as a partially preformed entity with pol II (a holoenzyme) that is recruited to the promoter in a single step (reviewed in Ref. 3Meyer V.E. Young R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27757-27760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). TFIIB plays a pivotal role in the PIC, providing a bridge between promoter-bound TFIID and pol II/TFIIF. Consistent with this, TFIIB has been found to interact with several other GTFs including TBP, TFIIF, and pol II (4Ha I. Roberts S. Maldonado E. Sun X. Kim L.-U. Green M. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). TFIIB is a 33-kDa peptide that contains a core C-terminal domain composed of two imperfect direct repeats and an N-terminal region that chelates zinc. Although intact TFIIB has evaded structural analysis, structural data have been obtained for the C-terminal domain in isolation (5Bagby S. Kim S.J. Maldonado E. Tong K.I. Reinberg D. Ikura M. Cell. 1995; 82: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay E.D. Usheva A.A. Hisatak K. Lee D.K. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The core C-terminal region is mainly α-helical, with the end of the first direct repeat forming a basic amphipathic α helix. The second direct repeat contains a surface cluster of hydrophobic amino acids and a helix-turn-helix motif that interacts with a specific DNA sequence upstream of the TATA element (7Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 8Qureshi S.A. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 389-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Structural information has also been obtained for the immediate N terminus of Pyrococcus furiosus TFIIB, revealing a β-sheet structure forming a zinc ribbon similar to that present in the elongation factor TFIIS (9Zhu W.L. Zeng Q.D. Colangel C.M. Lewis L.M. Summers M.F. Scott R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 122-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the TFIIB C-terminal domain in a complex with TBP bound to DNA has been solved (6Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay E.D. Usheva A.A. Hisatak K. Lee D.K. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). This structure suggested that the N terminus of TFIIB would project downstream toward the region of transcriptional initiation. Biochemical and structural evidence suggests that, in native TFIIB, the N- and C-terminal domains are engaged in an intramolecular interaction (10Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S. Ponticelli A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Hayashi F. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I. Kim S. Reinberg D. Bagby S. Ikura M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7941-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It is envisaged that to participate in a productive PIC, TFIIB must undergo a conformational change that disturbs this intramolecular interaction, exposing binding sites that are required for further assembly of the PIC. Deletion analysis of human TFIIB demonstrated that TFIIF interacts with the N terminus of TFIIB and pol II with the core C-terminal region (4Ha I. Roberts S. Maldonado E. Sun X. Kim L.-U. Green M. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Thus, a conformational change in TFIIB may facilitate the interaction between TFIIB and pol II/TFIIF. Underlying the central role of TFIIB in PIC assembly, TFIIB has been proposed as a target of transcriptional activator proteins (reviewed in Ref. 1Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). At the adenovirus E4 promoter, TFIIB assembly is a limiting event that can be facilitated by an activator protein (13Lin Y.-S. Green M.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 971-981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Moreover, several activation domains can interact with TFIIB, andin vitro evidence suggests that this interaction is required for transcriptional activation (14Roberts S.G.E. Ha I. Maldonado E. Reinberg D. Green M.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Significantly, the acidic activation domain of the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein can induce a conformational change in TFIIB that disrupts the intramolecular interaction (12Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This provides a possible mechanism by which activators could stimulate further assembly of the PIC. Once a PIC has assembled, the region around the transcription initiation site melts to provide a template strand for pol II. The actual site at which transcription initiation occurs is approximately 25–30 base pairs downstream of the TATA box in most eukaryotes (reviewed in Ref. 1Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where present, the TATA element is the sole determinant of the transcription initiation site, and initiation will occur at the distance set by TATA regardless of the sequence around the site of initiation (15O'Shea-Greenfield A. Smale S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1391-1402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One well studied exception to this is the yeast S. cerevisiae, in which the transcription initiation site can occur anywhere between 40 base pairs and 120 base pairs downstream of the TATA element (reviewed in Ref. 1Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even so, open complex formation occurs at a distance downstream of TATA similar to that seen in other organisms. A scanning polymerase model has been proposed in S. cerevisiae in which the PIC translocates downstream of the melted DNA and initiates transcription at distant sites (16Giardina C. Lis J.T. Science. 1993; 261: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Schizosaccharomyces pombe exhibits a start site position akin to that seen in human cells, 25–30 base pairs downstream of the TATA element. Factor-swapping experiments between S. pombe and S. cerevisiae found that TFIIB and pol II play a key role in determining the transcription initiation site (17Li Y. Flanagan P.M. Tschochner H. Kornberg R.D. Science. 1994; 263: 805-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). TFIIB and pol II are not individually interchangeable between the two yeast species. However, when exchanged together, not only does this result in full transcriptional activity in both species, but the start site use reflects the species from which the TFIIB and pol II were derived. Thus, TFIIB and pol II in concert determine the differences in transcription initiation site between S. cerevisiae and other eukaryotes. A genetic screen in S. cerevisiae recovered mutations in TFIIB that confer a bias toward the use of downstream transcription initiation sites (18Pinto I. Ware D.E. Hampsey M. Cell. 1992; 68: 977-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Two critical residues in yeast TFIIB were analyzed; Glu-62 and Arg-78. Substitution of residue Glu-62 with an amino acid of opposing charge (Lys) resulted in a yeast strain that exhibited cold sensitivity and a slow growth phenotype at 30 °C (19Pinto I. Wu W.-H. Na J.G. Hampsey M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30569-30573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription at the CYC1 and ADH1 genes in this strain showed a preference for the use of downstream initiation sites. The mutation of residue Arg-78 to cysteine resulted in a similar phenotype to E62K, but the mutant R78E resulted in a loss of viability. Because a double mutant (E62K/R78E) was phenotypically similar to E62K and not R78E, it was suggested that Glu-62 and Arg-78 may form a salt bridge. Glu-62 and Arg-78 mutants of TFIIB are transcriptionally defective in a yeastin vitro transcription system (10Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S. Ponticelli A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Bushnell D.A. Bamdad C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17859-17864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This can be explained, at least in part, by their failure to interact with pol II in several different assays. As discussed above, the mechanism of transcription start site selection in S. cerevisiae is distinct from that observed in most other eukaryotes. In this study we analyze human TFIIB mutants homologous to the S. cerevisiae mutants described above bothin vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, we find that all the mutants are able to support both basal transcription and the response to an activator protein. However, the mutants do exhibit a downstream shift in transcription start site selection in a promoter-specific manner. In vivo analysis confirmed the importance of these residues in human TFIIB for correct transcription start site selection. However, we demonstrate that mutation of a particular residue in human TFIIB affects a function in addition to transcription start site selection that manifests itself in vivo but is bypassed in vitro. We discuss these observations in light of current models of the role of TFIIB in both PIC formation and transcription start site selection. The promoter DNA template G5E4T has been described previously (23Lin Y.-S. Carey M. Ptashne M. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 659-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). G5ML contains nucleotides −50 to +22 from the adenovirus major late promoter cloned downstream of 5 GAL4 sites in the vector pGEM3. Polymerase chain reaction-mediated site-directed mutagenesis was performed to produce the E51R, E51D, E51A, R66E, R66K, R66A, and E51R/R66E mutants. All clones were sequenced to ensure only the intended mutations were present. cDNAs encoding wild type TFIIB and the mutants (E51R, R66E, R66A, R66K, and E51R/R66E) were cloned into the vector pCDNA3 for expression in 293 cells. The in vivo vector expressing GAL4-RII has been described previously (24Martin K.J. Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). TFIIB and TFIIB mutants and GAL4-AH were purified as described (4Ha I. Roberts S. Maldonado E. Sun X. Kim L.-U. Green M. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 23Lin Y.-S. Carey M. Ptashne M. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 659-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Polyhistidine-tagged TBP was purified by nickel chelate affinity chromatography as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). The HeLa fraction containing RNA polymerase II, TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH was purified as described previously (25Ge U. Martinez E. Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 ml of HeLa nuclear extract (10 mg/ml; Computer Cell Culture Center, Mons Belgium) in buffer A (40 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.1 m KCl was fractionated over a 15-ml phosphocellulose column. The 0.5 m KCl fraction (20 ml) was dialyzed against buffer A containing 0.1 m KCl. This was applied to a 3-ml DEAE-cellulose column, which was washed extensively with buffer A (0.1 m KCl) and then with buffer A (0.25 m KCl). RNA polymerase II/TFIIF and TFIIE were eluted in 5 ml of buffer A (0.3 m KCl) and dialyzed into buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.1 m KCl. This fraction was devoid of significant levels of TFIIB as assessed by immunoblotting, transcription, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Anti-TFIIB antiserum was produced against full-length recombinant TFIIB (Scottish antibody production unit). HeLa nuclear extract was depleted of TFIIB by immunoaffinity chromatography over a protein-G-Sepharose column containing covalently linked TFIIB antibodies. Transcription assays using HeLa nuclear extract or TFIIB-depleted nuclear extracts were performed as described (13Lin Y.-S. Green M.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 971-981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) using the amounts of recombinant TFIIB indicated in the figure legends. The reconstituted transcription assay was performed similarly, except it contained 20 μl of the HeLa RNA pol II/TFIIF/TFIIE fraction, 20 ng of recombinant TBP, and the indicated amounts of TFIIB. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 5 mml-glutamine, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Cells were transfected in 90-mm dishes at 50% confluency using calcium phosphate. Briefly, 1 μg of G5E4CAT (or G5MLCAT), 2 μg of RSV-BxGALII, and 2 μg of pCDNA3-TFIIB (or mutant) was diluted to 438 μl with water, and 61 μl of 2 mCaCl2 was added. This was mixed with 500 μl of 2× HBS (54.6 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 0.274 m NaCl, and 1.5 mm Na2HPO4). The mixture was added dropwise to a plate of cells, and the media was changed 24 h later. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. For immunoblot, equal volumes of cells were added to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-loading dye, and the proteins were resolved by electrophoresis. After transfer to Immobilon P membrane, immunoblotting was performed with anti-T7 antibody (Novagen), which recognizes a tag at the C terminus of the TFIIB derivatives. Detection was performed by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was prepared using an Rneasy kit as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). 50 μg of total RNA was annealed to a 32P-labeled CAT primer, and extension was performed as for the in vitrotranscription reactions. All transfections were performed at least three times. The region of S. cerevisiae TFIIB that is involved in transcription start site selection is very highly conserved between species (Fig. 1 A). We have constructed single (E51R, R66E) and a double (E51R/R66E) point mutants of human TFIIB that correspond to the S. cerevisiaeTFIIB mutants previously characterized by others to show defects in transcription start site selection (19Pinto I. Wu W.-H. Na J.G. Hampsey M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30569-30573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutants were purified fromEscherichia coli and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining, demonstrating that all of the proteins were of equivalent purity (Fig. 1 B). Wild type TFIIB and the mutants were then tested in a transcription reaction reconstituted from partially purified/recombinant factors and dependent upon the addition of TFIIB. The promoter DNA used was the adenovirus major late (AdML) promoter, and transcripts were detected by primer extension. Fig. 2 A shows that the system is dependent upon the addition of recombinant TFIIB for the production of accurately initiated transcripts (compare lanes 0 and wt IIB). E51R, R66E, and E51R,R66E were also able to support a level of transcription equivalent to that seen with wild type TFIIB. This is in contrast to the S. cerevisiae TFIIB mutants corresponding to E51R and R66E, which showed a significant defect in transcription in vitro (10Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S. Ponticelli A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Bushnell D.A. Bamdad C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17859-17864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Moreover, all of the mutants utilized the same transcription initiation site as that observed with wild type TFIIB.Figure 2The human TFIIB mutants are functional at the adenovirus major late promoter. A, wild type TFIIB (wt IIB) or the indicated mutants (20 ng) were added to anin vitro transcription reaction containing recombinant TBP (20 ng) and a purified fraction containing RNA polymerase II, TFIIF, and TFIIE (20 μl). Transcripts were detected by primer extension and analyzed by denaturing electrophoresis. A diagram of the reporter construct is shown below the autoradiogram. B, nuclear extract (NE) depleted of endogenous TFIIB by immunoaffinity chromatography was supplemented with either wild type TFIIB or the indicated mutants (20 ng and 100 ng) and tested in the presence of the transcriptional activator GAL4-AH (+).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In view of our finding that E51R, R66E, and E51R/R66E support transcription in vitro at a level equivalent to wild type TFIIB, we next tested the possibility that the mutants may be defective in supporting the levels of transcription required during transcriptional activation. To monitor the high levels of transcription in the presence of the activator GAL4-AH, we prepared a nuclear extract depleted of TFIIB by chromatography over a column containing immobilized TFIIB antibodies. The TFIIB-depleted nuclear extract was deficient in supporting significant levels of transcription in the presence of GAL4-AH, but addition of wild type TFIIB restored activated levels of transcription (Fig. 2 B). E51R, R66E, and E51R/R66E also restored high levels of transcriptional activation. Thus, the human TFIIB mutants E51R, R66E, and E51R/R66E exhibit wild type transcriptional activity (with respect to level and initiation site) at the AdML promoter both in the absence and presence of an activator protein. Transcription at the adenovirus major late promoter largely occurs from a single site. We therefore tested the adenovirus E4 promoter, at which transcription initiation naturally occurs at multiple sites. Fig.3 A shows transcription assays in a TFIIB-depleted extract in the presence of GAL4-AH at the AdE4 promoter. Consistent with the results we obtained with the AdML promoter, E51R, R66E, and E51R/R66E supported a level of transcriptional activation equivalent to wild type TFIIB. However, there was a clear shift toward the use of downstream initiation sites by all three of the mutants compared with wild type TFIIB. Specifically, there was an increase in the use of distal transcription initiation sites (indicated B and C) compared with proximal (A). The same effect was observed when we used GAL4-SP1 as the transcriptional activator (data not shown). To examine this further, we resolved the different transcripts produced by wild type TFIIB and E51R alongside a sequencing ladder of the AdE4 promoter produced using the same radiolabeled primer (Fig. 3 B). Comparing the transcripts produced by wild type TFIIB with those produced by E51R shows a clear shift toward the use of downstream initiation sites. The sequence of this region of the AdE4 promoter is shown in Fig. 3 C, with arrows indicating the sites of initiation in the presence of wild type TFIIB (shown above the sequence) and E51R (shown below the sequence). The size of thearrows indicates the relative use of each initiation site. Thus, the role of human TFIIB residues Glu-51 and Arg-66 in transcription start site selection is conserved between yeast and mammals. However, unlike in S. cerevisiae, the human mutants support transcription in vitro at a level equivalent to wild type TFIIB. The TFIIB start site mutations used above involve the substitution of charged amino acids with residues of opposite charge. We next constructed substitutions of Glu-51 and Arg-66 to either alanine (E51A and R66A) or different amino acids of similar charge (E51D and R66K). The recombinant proteins (shown in Fig.4 A) were tested in a TFIIB-depleted nuclear extract at the AdE4 promoter (Fig.4 B). As seen with the original mutants, E51A, E51D, R66A, and R66K all supported transcription in vitro to a level equivalent to that observed with wild type TFIIB. Furthermore, they all caused a downstream shift in the transcription start sites. Thus, the charge per se of these residues is not the critical determinant in correct transcription start site selection in vitro. The human TFIIB start site mutants E51R, R66E, and E51R/R66E support levels of basal and activated transcription in vitro similar to that seen with wild type TFIIB. It would be predicted therefore that the addition of an excess of one of the mutant TFIIB proteins to a native nuclear extract would titrate the HeLa TFIIB and result in a downstream shift in the transcription initiation site. We tested this possibility and found that this was indeed the case (data not shown and Fig.5 A). We reasoned that this effect would also occur in a living cell and therefore used a transient transfection assay to determine whether the start site shift effects we observe in vitro could be recapitulated in vivo. Transfection of G5E4T into living cells failed to produce a stable message. We therefore used the same G5E4 core promoter but fused to CAT, which allowed us to detect stable transcripts. Thus, it was first necessary to test G5E4CAT in vitro to ensure that we could make a direct comparison with the in vivo effects. Fig.5 A shows a transcription assay using G5E4CAT and native nuclear extract to which either wild type TFIIB, E51R, R66E, or E51R/R66E had been added. Results comparable with those seen in a TFIIB-depleted extract with G5E4T were obtained. Specifically, the mutants caused a shift toward the use of distal transcription initiation sites (B and C) with a concomitant reduction in the proximal initiation sites (A). Next, wild type TFIIB or the mutants (E51R, R66E, and E51R/R66E) under a cytomegalovirus promoter were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells along with the activator Gal4-RII and G5E4CAT. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, total RNA was prepared, then primer extension was performed to analyze the transcripts. A representative assay is shown in Fig. 5 B. There are several striking features in this result. First, there is a clear difference in the transcription start site pattern at the AdE4 promoter in vivo compared with that seen in vitro. Essentially, the most distal initiation sites seen in vitro (C) are not used in vivo. This cannot be explained by the difference in cell type as nuclear extracts made from 293 cells produce the same pattern of transcripts at the AdE4 promoter as HeLa cell nuclear extracts (data not shown). Second, in contrast to our in vitro observations, R66E significantly inhibited transcription in the transient transfection assay, but E51R and E51R/R66E did not. This was not because of a difference in the levels of the various TFIIB constructs, as immunoblotting showed that wild type TFIIB and the mutants were of similar abundance (Fig. 5 C). Finally, overexpression of E51R and E51R/R66E caused a shift toward the use of the downstream transcription initiation sites. The intensities of the two sets of transcripts (A and B) were quantified and are expressed as a ratio (B/A) below eachlane. Thus, although there are greater constraints on the pattern of transcription initiation at the AdE4 promoter in vivo, there is a clear shift toward the use of the downstream transcription initiation sites in vivo by the TFIIB mutants. Moreover, the low level of E4 transcription remaining in cells transfected with R66E also exhibited the downstream shift. We next performed a set of transfections identical to those above but using G5MLCAT as a reporter (Fig. 5 D). As seen with the E4 promoter, R66E significantly inhibited transcription, but E51R and E51R/R66E did not. Consistent with our in vitro data, only a single transcript was produced from the AdML promoter, and the mutants did not cause the use of an alternative site. In view of the difference we observed in the properties of hTFIIB R66Ein vivo versus in vitro, we next compared R66E with the mutants R66A and R66K in a transient transfection assay (Fig. 6 A). As before, R66E inhibited transcription, with residual activity showing a downstream shift in transcription initiation site. The mutant R66A was also inhibitory, although we consistently found this mutant to be less inhibitory than R66E. In agreement with our in vitroobservations, R66A also caused a downstream shift in the site of transcription initiation. Interestingly, R66K did not significantly inhibit transcription transcription in vivo, although it did cause a downstream shift in the transcription initiation site. All of the mutants were expressed at similar levels in the transfection assay, as assessed by immunoblotting (Fig. 6 B). Thus, although the charge of hTFIIB residue 66 is critical in determining the innate transcription function of TFIIB in vivo, it is not sufficient for correct transcription start site utilization eitherin vivo or in vitro. In this study we have demonstrated that, despite the distinct mechanisms in transcription start site selection observed in S. cerevisiae and mammals, the role of TFIIB in this process is highly conserved. The mutation of two highly conserved charged residues in the N terminus of human TFIIB, homologous to those previously described in the S. cerevisiae, caused a downstream shift in transcription start site selection both in vitro andin vivo. The transcription start site shift caused by E51R, R66E, and E51R/R66E was promoter-specific, as it occurred at the AdE4 promoter and not the AdML promoter. Unlike the AdML promoter, the E4 promoter intrinsically exhibits a more flexible transcription initiation site pattern. This observation is similar to previous findings with the S. cerevisiae TFIIB mutants, which caused a transcription start site shift only at promoters that normally exhibit multiple transcription start sites (22Pardee T.S.

Biol. 1994; 14: 226-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that alterations in transcription initiation site are not tolerated at the AdML promoter. Thus, as the mutants are competent for innate transcription function in vitro, they would appear to function similarly to wild type TFIIB at the AdML promoter. There are several charged residues in this highly conserved region of TFIIB, suggesting that they may form a functional domain that interacts with a similarly charged surface in another protein. Indeed, alterations to the charge of this region invariably results in TFIIB mutants that confer downstream shifts in the transcription initiation site (10Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S. Ponticelli A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Pardee T.S. Bangur C.S. Ponticelli A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17859-17864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) 2N. A. Hawkes and S. G. E. Roberts, unpublished observations. . Interactions involving complementary electrostatic charge are energetically neutral as each domain is able to form a favorable interaction with water (27Honig B. Nicholls A. Science. 1995; 268: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar). Once removed from water, charged/polar groups need to form ion pairs and hydrogen bonds with a complementary surface. The net result does not generally contribute to the affinity of the interaction but can have effects on the specificity and, therefore, the shape of the resulting complex. This raises the intriguing possibility that the mutants we describe in this study cause a shift in the transcription initiation site not because the interaction with pol II/TFIIF (or other factors) is ablated but because of an alteration in the alignment of the complex. Such a model would be consistent with our finding that the human TFIIB start site mutants support transcription to a level equivalent to wild type TFIIB in vitro. Structural analysis of this region of TFIIB will shed light on the role of the charged cluster domain of TFIIB in transcription start site selection. The transcription start site shift induced by the various mutants used in this study was the same. Presumably, any alteration in the positioning of pol II at the promoter would be constrained relative to TATA and, therefore, provide a limited number of potential transcription start sites. We also note that the TFIIB mutants are still able to direct transcription initiation at all of the upstream sites seen with wild type TFIIB, albeit to a lesser degree. It is therefore likely that the role of TFIIB in the selection of the transcription initiation site may be restricted to modulating the 3′ parameter, whereas other factors determine the 5′ parameter. Indeed, mutants of the S. cerevisiae RBP9 subunit of pol II cause an upstream shift in transcription start site selection (28Furter-Graves E.M. Hall B.D. Furter R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4932-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 29Hull M.W. McKune K. Woychik N.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The conservative TFIIB substitution mutants E51D and R66K also caused a downstream shift in transcription start site selection. Thus, chargeper se within this region is not the sole determinant of correct transcription start site selection. Alterations in the size of the side chains of key amino acids may also have effects on the alignment of a protein-protein interaction. Significantly, the residues corresponding to human TFIIB Glu-51 and Arg-66 are totally conserved in all species sequenced to date. Although other charged residues are also totally conserved, some are substituted by residues of similar charge, and still others, where the charge is removed altogether. It is important to note that TFIIB exhibits a high degree of species specificity. Unlike TBP, S. cerevisiae and human TFIIB are not functionally interchangeable, even in basal transcription (30Shaw S.P. Wingfield J. Dorsey M. Ma J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3651-3657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that human TFIIB can substitute forDrosophila TFIIB only at certain promoters (31Wampler S.L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1542-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is possible that the differences in the charge cluster domain of TFIIB contribute to this species specificity. In contrast to our results with human TFIIB, homologous yeast TFIIB mutants are defective for transcription in vitro (10Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S. Ponticelli A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,20Bushnell D.A. Bamdad C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20170-20174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Leuther K.K. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 773-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Pardee T.S. Bangur C.S. Ponticelli A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17859-17864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This defect of the S. cerevisiae mutants correlates with their inability to stably interact with RNA polymerase II in several different assays. Deletion mapping studies of human TFIIB have shown that the N terminus (including the region studied in this work) is dispensable for interaction with RNA polymerase II (4Ha I. Roberts S. Maldonado E. Sun X. Kim L.-U. Green M. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, deletion of the N terminus of S. cerevisiae TFIIB abolishes the interaction with pol II (22Pardee T.S. Bangur C.S. Ponticelli A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17859-17864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, evidence has been presented that the region of S. cerevisiae TFIIB responsible for transcription start site selection and direct interaction with pol II may constitute distinct, but overlapping, domains within the N terminus (22Pardee T.S. Bangur C.S. Ponticelli A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17859-17864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the nature of the contacts between TFIIB and pol II (and/or other components of the general transcription machinery) have diverged from S. cerevisiae to humans. Perhaps yeast TFIIB requires a more intricate interaction with pol II as part of the scanning mechanism responsible for transcription start site selection in S. cerevisiae. Because S. pombe exhibits a transcription start site pattern similar to that seen in human cells, analysis of the TFIIB-pol II interaction in this species should help resolve this issue. The human TFIIB mutant R66E was indistinguishable from E51R or E51R/R66E in in vitro transcription assays. However, in transfection analysis R66E was a potent inhibitor of transcription, whereas E51R and E51R/R66E caused effects similar to those seenin vitro. Importantly, the low level of transcription observed in the presence of R66E in vivo exhibited a downstream shift in the transcription initiation site. Thus, TFIIB R66E is severely compromised in its ability to support transcriptionin vivo in a manner that is bypassed in vitro. Furthermore, this defect can be suppressed by the additional mutation E51R. This compensation effect in vivo is consistent with the previous observation that the S. cerevisiae homolog of human R66E is lethal but can be rescued by a second mutation corresponding to human E51R (19Pinto I. Wu W.-H. Na J.G. Hampsey M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30569-30573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conclusion of the observations inS. cerevisiae was that these two residues of opposite charge form a salt bridge. Our data are consistent with this proposal but also suggest that the salt bridge has a function that is not critical for the innate ability of TFIIB to support transcription of a naked DNA template in vitro. Substitution of Arg-66 with lysine also results in a TFIIB mutant that causes a downstream shift in transcription initiation site both in vitro and in vivo. However, this conservative substitution mutant does not significantly inhibit transcription in vivo. Taken together, these data suggest that Arg-66 plays a role in two functions; first, transcription start site selection that is determined by the specific amino acid side chain, and second, a role that is required in vivo but not in vitro and is dependent upon the charge of the residue only. A function that is required of TFIIB in vivo, but is bypassed in vitro, has several implications for our understanding of the role of TFIIB in transcription initiation. Moreover, our findings question the minimal requirements for a functional PIC in vivo as compared with those observedin vitro. Several GTFs are dispensable for transcriptionin vitro using supercoiled DNA templates (reviewed in Ref.2Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). TFIIF is one such GTF and is highly relevant in this case, because both subunits (RAP30 and RAP74) can interact with TFIIB and more specifically the N terminus of human TFIIB (4Ha I. Roberts S. Maldonado E. Sun X. Kim L.-U. Green M. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 32Fang S.M. Burton Z.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11703-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, suppressor mutants of the large subunit of TFIIF have been isolated that can reverse the slow growth phenotype and transcription start site defects of the yeast TFIIB mutant E62K (human Glu-51 (33Sun Z.W. Hampsey M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3127-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)). However, our preliminary data suggest that neither TFIIB E51R or R66E are defective for interaction with RAP30 or RAP74 in vitro. 2 As discussed above, these mutations in TFIIB may alter the specificity rather than abolish interactions with other factors. It is possible that the RAP74 suppressor mutants restore the alignment of the yTFIIB(E62R)-pol II/TFIIF interaction, leading to normal transcription start site selection. DNA topology may affect the ability of R66E to substitute the function of wild type TFIIB in vivo. For example, R66E may be nonfunctional at a nucleosome-assembled promoter. Experiments in vitro using nucleosomal DNA templates could be used to test this hypothesis. It is also possible that the in vivo-specific defect of R66E involves the response to upstream transcriptional activators. Indeed, a S. cerevisiae protein (SUB1) similar to the mammalian coactivator PC4 was isolated as a suppressor of the yTFIIB R78H cold-sensitive phenotype (34Knaus R. Pollock R. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1933-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The prospect of an additional function for TFIIB underscores the pivotal role that this GTF plays in transcription. Further studies are currently in progress to determine the function of TFIIB that is specifically required in a living cell.

The enzyme has intrinsic specificity for binding to nicked duplex DNA. To delineate the ligase-DNA interface, we have footprinted the enzyme binding site on DNA and the DNA binding site on ligase. The size of the exonuclease III footprint of ligase bound a single nick in duplex DNA is 19–21 nucleotides. The footprint is asymmetric, extending 8–9 nucleotides on the 3′-OH side of the nick and 11–12 nucleotides on the 5′-phosphate side. The 5′-phosphate moiety is essential for the binding of Chlorella virus ligase to nicked DNA. Here we show that the 3′-OH moiety is not required for nick recognition. The Chlorella virus ligase binds to a nicked ligand containing 2′,3′-dideoxy and 5′-phosphate termini, but cannot catalyze adenylation of the 5′-end. Hence, the 3′-OH is important for step 2 chemistry even though it is not itself chemically transformed during DNA-adenylate formation. A 2′-OH cannot substitute for the essential 3′-OH in adenylation at a nick or even in strand closure at a preadenylated nick. The protein side of the ligase-DNA interface was probed by limited proteolysis of ligase with trypsin and chymotrypsin in the presence and absence of nicked DNA. Protease accessible sites are clustered within a short segment from amino acids 210–225 located distal to conserved motif V. The ligase is protected from proteolysis by nicked DNA. Protease cleavage of the native enzyme prior to DNA addition results in loss of DNA binding. These results suggest a bipartite domain structure in which the interdomain segment either comprises part of the DNA binding site or undergoes a conformational change upon DNA binding.

The domain structure of Chlorella virus ligase inferred from the solution experiments is consistent with the structure of T7 DNA ligase determined by x-ray crystallography. ATP-dependent DNA ligases catalyze the joining of a 5′-phosphate-terminated strand to a 3′-hydroxyl-terminated strand via three sequential nucleotidyl transfer reactions (1Lehman I.R. Science. 1974; 186: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 2Engler M.J. Richardson C.C. Enzymes. 1982; 15: 3-29Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the first step, nucleophilic attack on the α-phosphorus of ATP by ligase results in release of pyrophosphate and formation of a covalent intermediate (ligase-adenylate) in which AMP is linked via a phosphoamide (P–N) bond to the ε-amino group of a lysine. In the second step, the AMP is transferred to the 5′-end of the 5′-phosphate-terminated DNA strand to form a DNA-adenylate intermediate, A(5′)pp(5′)N. In this reaction, a 5′-phosphate oxygen of the DNA strand attacks the phosphorus of ligase-adenylate; the active site lysine side chain is the leaving group. In the third step, ligase catalyzes attack by the 3′-OH of the nick on the DNA-adenylate to join the two polynucleotides and release AMP. ATP-dependent ligases are ubiquitous in eukaryotes. They are also encoded by certain eubacteria, bacteriophages, and eukaryotic DNA viruses. Sequence comparisons suggest that a catalytic domain common to all ATP-dependent ligases is embellished by additional isozyme-specific protein segments at the N or C termini (3Tomkinson A.E. Mackey Z.B. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain includes a set of six collinear motifs (I, III, IIIa, IV, V, and VI) that define a superfamily of covalent nucleotidyl transferases encompassing the ATP-dependent polynucleotide ligases and GTP-dependent mRNA capping enzymes (4Shuman S. Schwer B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 5Shuman S. Structure. 1996; 4: 653-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of T7 DNA ligase with bound ATP shows that the nucleotide binding pocket is composed of motifs I, III, IIIa, IV, and V (6Subramanya H.S. Doherty A.J. Ashford S.R. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1996; 85: 607-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The lysine in motif I (KXDGXR) is the site of covalent attachment of AMP to the enzyme (7Tomkinson A.E. Totty N.F. Ginsburg M. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Crystallography and mutagenesis have illuminated enzymic functional groups that are involved in nucleotide binding and nucleotidyl transfer (6Subramanya H.S. Doherty A.J. Ashford S.R. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1996; 85: 607-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 8Kodama K. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). What remains obscure is the structural basis for DNA nick recognition by DNA ligases. Conversion of nicks into phosphodiester bonds is the common final step in the DNA repair and replication pathways. Nicks are potentially deleterious DNA lesions that, if not corrected, may give rise to lethal double-strand breaks. One imagines a mechanism to ensure that ligases are directed to sites where their action is required, either via the interaction of ligase with other replication or repair proteins assembled at a nick (3Tomkinson A.E. Mackey Z.B. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) or via an intrinsic capacity to discriminate nicks from other DNA structures. We are examining the interaction of eukaryotic ligases with defined DNAs using virus-encoded enzymes as models. Vaccinia virus DNA ligase and Chlorella virus DNA ligase each forms a discrete complex with a singly nicked DNA ligand in the absence of magnesium that can be resolved from free DNA by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (11Shuman S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16138-16147Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Ho C.K. Van Etten J.L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1931-1937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The viral ligases do not form stable complexes with the following ligands: (i) DNA containing a 1- or 2-nucleotide gap, (ii) the sealed duplex DNA product of the ligation reaction, (iii) a singly nicked duplex containing a 5′-OH terminus at the nick instead of a 5′-phosphate, or (iv) a singly nicked duplex containing an RNA strand on the 5′-phosphate side of the nick (10Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 11Shuman S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16138-16147Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Ho C.K.

These DNA ligases apparently do have an intrinsic nick sensing function. Discrimination at the substrate binding step may account for the feeble activity of the eukaryotic viral DNA ligases in sealing across gaps and in joining nicked molecules containing a 5′-phosphate-terminated RNA strand (14Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9073-9079Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,15Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3536-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Nick recognition by vaccinia virus DNA ligase andChlorella virus DNA ligase also depends on occupancy of the AMP binding pocket on the enzyme, i.e. mutations of the ligase active site that abolish the capacity to form the ligase-adenylate intermediate also eliminate nick recognition, whereas a mutation that preserves ligase-adenylate formation, but inactivates downstream steps of the strand joining reaction, has no effect on binding to nicked DNA (10Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 13Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9679-9684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To physically map the ligase-DNA interface, we sought to obtain footprints of the ligase binding site on DNA and the DNA binding site on ligase. We conducted this analysis using the 298-amino acidChlorella virus PBCV-1 DNA ligase, which is the smallest eukaryotic DNA ligase known and likely constitutes the minimal catalytic unit (12Ho C.K. Van Etten J.L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1931-1937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A confounding technical factor in nuclease-footprinting the DNA side of the ligase-DNA interface was the requirement for a divalent cation cofactor at the nuclease digestion step, the problem being that the ligase-adenylate, which binds to nicked DNA in the absence of divalent cations, immediately catalyzes strand joining upon addition of a divalent cation and then dissociates from the closed duplex ligation product. The enabling factor in obtaining a nuclease footprint of the ligase-DNA complex was the finding that an alanine substitution for Asp-29 in motif I ofChlorella virus DNA ligase (27KXDGXR32) blocks step 2 of the ligation pathway without affecting enzyme-adenylate formation and nick recognition (10Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This “step-arrest” mutant ligase remains bound at the nick in the presence of magnesium; consequently, the D29A-DNA complexes could be footprinted with exonuclease III. We report that the ligase footprint extends from 8–9 nucleotides on the 3′-OH side of the nick to 11–12 nucleotides on the 5′-phosphate side of the nick. To examine the protein component of the ligase-DNA interface, we used the classical approach of limited proteolysis to probe the structure of Chlorella virus DNA ligase in the free and DNA-bound states. The Chlorella virus ligase consists of two protease-resistant domains connected by a protease-sensitive interdomain segment located between motifs V and VI. Protection of the interdomain segment from proteolysis upon binding to nicked DNA implicates this region as a component of the DNA binding surface of the enzyme. Recombinant wild typeChlorella virus DNA ligase (12Ho C.K. Van Etten J.L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1931-1937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift of Dr. C. K. Ho. Mutant enzyme D29A (10Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was expressed in bacteria without an affinity tag and purified from soluble cell lysates by S-Sepharose and blue-Sepharose column chromatography. The chromatographic behavior of D29A was monitored by SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DTT, dithiothreitol analysis of the column fractions. The lysate was applied to S-Sepharose that had been equilibrated with 0.2 m NaCl in Buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol). The column was step-eluted with Buffer A containing 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 m NaCl. D29A was recovered in the 0.6m NaCl step. The peak fractions were pooled, diluted to 0.2m NaCl, and then adsorbed to a blue-Sepharose column that had been equilibrated with 0.2 m NaCl in Buffer A. The column was developed with a linear gradient of 0.2–1 mNaCl. D29A was eluted at ∼0.6 m NaCl. The peak fractions were pooled and concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration. Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad dye reagent. The D29A enzyme preparation was a generous gift of Dr. Aidan Doherty. DNA ligands used in DNA binding and footprinting experiments were prepared by annealing a 5′32P-labeled oligonucleotide to unlabeled complementary strands to form the nicked and gapped structures depicted in the figures. End-labeling reactions and gel purification of the32P-labeled strands were performed as described (9Shuman S. Ru X. Virology. 1995; 211: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Labeled oligonucleotides were annealed to an ∼4-fold molar excess of unlabeled strands in a solution of 0.2 m NaCl by heating the mixture for 5 min at 65 °C and then cooling slowly to 22 °C. A 2′,3′-dideoxy-terminated 19-mer strand was prepared in two stages. First, an 18-mer strand d(ACATATCCGTGTCGCCCT) was 5′32P-labeled and gel-purified. Then, the labeled 18-mer was reacted for 30 min at 37 °C with 1 mm dideoxythymidine triphosphate and calf thymus terminal transferase (57 units; Promega) in primer extension buffer containing 0.1 m potassium cacodylate (pH 7.2), 10 mm CoCl2, and 1 mm DTT. The 19-mer dideoxy product was separated from residual 18-mer substrate by preparative electrophoresis through a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. The labeled strands were localized by autoradiography, and the 19-mer was eluted from an excised gel slice and recovered by ethanol precipitation. A 3′-deoxy, 2′-hydroxyl-terminated 19-mer strand was prepared in similar fashion. First, an 18-mer strand d(CATATCCGTGTCGCCCTT) was 5′32P-labeled and gel-purified. Then, the labeled 18-mer was reacted for 30 min at 37 °C with 1 mm 3′ dATP (cordycepin triphosphate) and calf thymus terminal transferase. The 19-mer 2′-OH product was separated from residual 18-mer substrate by preparative electrophoresis through a 20% polyacrylamide gel and recovered as described above. To footprint the ligase-DNA interface on the 5′-phosphate side of a DNA nick, we incubated the purified D29A enzyme with a singly nicked ligand consisting of a 42-nucleotide 3′-OH-terminated hairpin DNA and a 5′32P-labeled 18-mer strand annealed to the 5′-tail of the hairpin strand (Fig. 1 A). The binding reaction mixtures contained 50 nm nicked DNA and up to 0.8 μm ligase. At these concentrations of DNA and protein, it is the adenylated form of Chlorella virus ligase that binds to the nick to form a discrete complex (10Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Analysis of the binding reaction mixtures by native gel electrophoresis showed that nearly all of the 32P-labeled nicked DNA was bound at 0.2 μm D29A, which suggests that about one-fourth of the enzyme molecules in the preparation were adenylated (Fig.1 B). The D29A-adenylate is defective in the transfer of AMP to the 5′-phosphate of the nick (10Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Hence, the enzyme remained bound at the nick when magnesium was included in the reaction mixtures (not shown). Analysis by denaturing gel electrophoresis confirmed that the32P-labeled 18-mer strand was unreactive with a molar excess of D29A in the presence of magnesium during a 10-min incubation at 22 °C (Fig. 1 C, lane + and data not shown). The ligase-DNA mixtures and a control sample containing DNA alone were treated with exonuclease III. The 5′-labeled digestion products were resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography. The amount of exonuclease III included in the reactions was sufficient to convert all of the 32P-labeled 18-mer into a rapidly migrating species of less than 5 nucleotides (Fig. 1 C). Ligase binding to the DNA resulted in the appearance of a nuclease resistant doublet at the expense of the complete digestion product. The upper band comigrated with a 5′32P-labeled 12-mer pATTCCGATAGTG identical in sequence to the first 12 nucleotides of the input 18-mer strand (lane M). The ligase concentration dependence of exonuclease III protection was similar to the ligase dependence of the protein-DNA complex formation (Fig. 1 and data not shown). We conclude that the ligase footprint on the 5′-phosphate strand extends 11–12 nucleotides downstream of the nick. The ligase footprint on the 3′-OH side of the nick was determined using a different DNA ligand composed of three strands annealed to form the structure shown in Fig. 2. This DNA was32P-labeled at the 5′-end of the 60-mer template strand. Incubation of the nicked DNA with a molar excess of D29A ligase did not alter the size of the labeled strand. Exonuclease III digestion of the DNA in the absence of ligase converted all of the 60-mer into shorter 5′-labeled oligonucleotides, principally a cluster of three species migrating at ∼11–13 nucleotides and a minor product of ∼23 nucleotides. Binding of D29A ligase resulted in the appearance of an exonuclease III-resistant doublet migrating at 38–39 nucleotides (denoted by the asterisk in Fig. 2). Hence, the ligase footprint on the 3′-OH side of the nick spans 8–9 nucleotides on the template strand. The D29A protein is impaired in the catalysis of DNA-adenylate formation and, consequently, in strand joining. To gauge the magnitude of the catalytic defect, we performed a kinetic analysis of the reaction of D29A with the nicked hairpin substrate under single-turnover conditions (i.e. at an 8:1 molar ratio of enzyme to DNA). We found that D29A catalyzed progressive strand joining over a period of 20 h, attaining an end point with 84% of the input nicked substrate being sealed (Fig.3). The reaction proceeded with apparent first-order kinetics. A fit of the data to a single exponential yielded a rate constant of 3.5 × 10−5 s−1. A comparison of this value to the rate constant of 0.23 s−1for single-turnover ligation by the wild type Chlorellavirus ligase (10Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) indicates that the conserved motif I Asp residue contributes about a 6000-fold enhancement of the reaction rate. Note that there was no detectable accumulation of DNA-adenylate during the D29A reaction (Fig. 3), implying that DNA-adenylate formation (step 2), not the attack of the 3′-OH on DNA-adenylate to form the phosphodiester (step 3), is rate-limiting for D29A. Chlorella virus DNA ligase binds selectively to DNA molecules containing a nick. The 5′-phosphate group and the 3′-nucleotide at the nick are critical for DNA recognition (10Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 12Ho C.K. Van Etten J.L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1931-1937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the 3′-OH moiety in DNA binding has not been evaluated. In the experiment shown in Fig. 4, we analyzed by native gel electrophoresis the binding of wild type ligase to a DNA ligand containing a standard 3′-OH/5′-phosphate nickversus ligands containing variant structures at the termini of the discontinuous top strands. The ligase bound to nicked DNA, but it did not form a complex with nicked DNA lacking a 5′-phosphate or with DNA containing a 1-nucleotide gap between the 5′-phosphate and the 3′-OH groups (Fig. 4 B). To test specifically the role of the 3′-OH group, we prepared a ligand containing a single 3′-dideoxynucleotide at the nick (Fig. 4 A). The instructive finding was that ligase did bind to a 3′-deoxy/5′-phosphate nick (Fig.4 B). Similar experiments performed with purified recombinant vaccinia virus DNA ligase showed that it was also capable of binding to a 3′-deoxy/5′-phosphate nick (not shown). Thus, the 3′-OH moiety is not required for nick recognition by the two virus-encoded enzymes. The second step of the ligase pathway is the reaction of DNA-bound ligase-adenylate with the 5′-phosphate at the nick to form the nicked DNA-adenylate intermediate. DNA-adenylate is normally undetectable during reactions catalyzed by eukaryotic viral ligases (11Shuman S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16138-16147Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Ho C.K. Van Etten J.L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1931-1937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); this is because the enzyme remains bound to the nicked DNA-adenylate after step 2 and rapidly catalyzes the attack of the 3′-OH on DNA-adenylate to form a phosphodiester. By definition, the 3′-OH is required for step 3. But does the 3′-OH participate in step 2? We have shown here that a 3′-OH is not required for the binding of ligase to the nicked substrate. If the 3′-OH plays no role in step 2 chemistry, we would expect to detect the accumulation of DNA-adenylate when ligase reacts with the 3′-deoxy/5′-phosphate nicked DNA substrate. 3′-OH/5′-Phosphate-nicked DNA and 3′-deoxy/5′-phosphate-nicked DNA substrates (both 5′ 32P-labeled at the nick) were incubated with an 8-fold molar excess of wild type Chlorella virus DNA ligase in the presence of magnesium and ATP. Reaction with the standard nick resulted in near quantitative joining of the 5′32P-labeled 18-mer strand to the unlabeled 42-mer hairpin strand to form a 60-mer ligation product (Fig.5 B). Chlorellavirus ligase formed no 37-mer ligation product with the 3′-deoxy substrate (as expected), but we also detected no adenylate transfer to the 5′ 32P-labeled 18-mer strand. A positive control for DNA-adenylate formation was provided by the reaction of vaccinia virus DNA ligase with a 1-nucleotide gapped substrate. The vaccinia ligase binds weakly to the gapped substrate, but it can catalyze step 2 under conditions of enzyme excess (11Shuman S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16138-16147Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The ligase tends to dissociate from the gapped DNA-adenylate step 2 product without executing step 3. This leads to the accumulation of high levels of an adenylated DNA strand, AppDNA, and very little formation of the expected 36-mer ligation product (Fig. 5 B). Note that reaction of vaccinia ligase with the 3′-deoxy nicked DNA substrate yielded only trace amounts of DNA-adenylate (<1% of the input 5′-phosphate strand was adenylated) (Fig. 5 B). We surmise from this experiment that a 3′-OH moiety is critical for DNA-adenylate formation by the two virus-encoded DNA ligases. We performed an additional experiment in which Chlorella virus DNA ligase was reacted in stoichiometric amounts with a nicked substrate consisting of a 5′32P-labeled 18-mer (pTTCCGATAGTGACTACAG) and a 2′-OH-terminated 19-mer strand (pCATATCCGTGTCGCCCTTA-2′-OH) annealed to a complementary 36-mer template strand. (The 2′-OH-terminated 19-mer strand was prepared by 3′ extension of an 18-mer with cordycepin triphosphate.) The ligase catalyzed no detectable joining of the two strands to form an expected 37-mer ligation product and there was only a trace conversion of the 5′ 32P-labeled 18-mer to DNA-adenylate (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the essential role of the 3′-OH at the nick in DNA adenylate formation cannot be fulfilled by a 2′-OH moiety. Note that the presence of a 2′-OH has no inhibitory effects on the action of Chlorella virus DNA ligase, which is perfectly capable of binding and sealing a nicked duplex in which the 3′-OH strand is all RNA (15Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3536-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Can a 2′-OH serve as the nucleophile in step 3 of the ligation reaction? To answer this question, we tested the ability ofChlorella virus ligase to seal a preadenylated nicked duplex DNA containing a 2′-OH at the nick (Fig.6). The use of a preadenylated nicked molecule bypasses the requirement for the 3′-OH during step 2 and allows us to focus exclusively on the reactivity of a 2′-OH as the nucleophile in the strand closure step. The preadenylated 2′-OH substrate and a preadenylated 3′ OH control nicked DNA substrate were reacted with an 8-fold excess of ligase for 60 min. The 3′-OH substrate was efficiently joined to the adenylated strand to yield the expected ligation product, and the reaction was complete in 15 min (Fig. 6). In contrast, the 2′-OH strand was completely unreactive with the DNA-adenylate (Fig. 6). We conclude that Chlorella virus ligase displays a strict requirement for a 3′-OH during the step of phosphodiester bond formation. Purified D29A ligase was subjected to proteolysis with increasing amounts of trypsin. SDS-PAGE analysis of the undigested enzyme preparation revealed an ∼40 kDa polypeptide corresponding to the Chlorella virus ligase (Fig.7). The electrophoretic mobility of the 298-amino acid PBCV-1 ligase (predicted size of 34 kDa) is anomalously slow (12Ho C.K. Van Etten J.L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1931-1937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequencing of the 40-kDa species by automated Edman chemistry after transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane confirmed that the N-terminal sequence (AITKPL) corresponded to that of the Chlorella virus enzyme beginning at residue Ala-2 of the ligase polypeptide. Apparently, the ligase suffered removal of the initiating methionine during expression in Escherichia coli. Initial scission of the ligase at low concentrations of trypsin yielded two clusters of digestion products: a set of 3 polypeptides migrating at ∼26–29 kDa and a smaller set of polypeptides migrating at ∼10–12 kDa (Fig. 7). Sequencing of these cleavage products revealed that each of the polypeptides in the larger cluster derived from the N terminus of the enzyme. The lower molecular mass cluster was a mixture of at least 4 polypeptides. The N-terminal sequences of the two major species, RSTHKSGKV and STHKSGKVE, indicated that these products arose by tryptic cleavage at Lys-219/Arg-220 and Arg-220/Ser-221. Two less abundant peptides within the low molecular mass cluster derived from tryptic cleavages at Lys-210/Thr-211 and Lys-224/Ser-225. The trypsin-accessible sites fall within a 16-amino acid segment between nucleotidyl transferase motifs V and VI (see Fig. 10). The finding that the two clusters of tryptic products persisted at trypsin concentrations in excess of the amount sufficient to cleave all of the input protein suggested that these species corresponded to folded protein domains. The sensitivity of wild type ligase to tryptic proteolysis was identical to that observed with the D29A enzyme (not shown). These results are consistent with a bipartite ligase structure consisting of a larger N-terminal domain and a smaller C-terminal domain connected by a linker segment distal to motif V.Figure 10Sites of protease cleavage within nativeChlorella virus DNA ligase. The amino acid sequence of Chlorella virus DNA ligase is shown. Nucleotidyl transferase motifs I, III, IIIa, IV, V, and VI arehighlighted in boxes. The sites of proteolysis by trypsin are denoted by the arrows above the sequence, and sites cleaved by chymotrypsin are indicated by the arrows below the sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The tryptic sensitivity of free ligase was compared with that of ligase preincubated with an equimolar concentration (15 μm) of DNA ligand containing a single 3′-OH/5′-phosphate nick. The trypsin concentration dependence of cleavage of the free enzyme to yield the N-terminal cluster (Fig.8) was similar to that seen in Fig. 7. Nicked DNA afforded substantial (∼8-fold) protection of the ligase from tryptic digestion (Fig. 8). We did not observe protection of ligase from trypsin digestion when the ligase was preincubated with the 42-mer hairpin strand alone (not shown). These results suggest that the trypsin-sensitive segment of the free ligase that is protected in the presence of DNA may comprise part of the DNA binding site on the enzyme. Alternatively, protection from proteolysis may occur because of a ligand-induced conformational change involving a site on the enzyme other than the DNA-binding surface. A ligand-induced conformational change would be supported by a finding of DNA-induced acquisition of trypsin sensitivity at novel sites not cleaved in the free enzyme. However, we found that the electrophoretic mobility of the digestion products generated in the presence of nicked DNA did n"

Exposure of some tissues and cells to EGF also stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity and results in an increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. Because cAMP activates the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), we investigated the effect of PKA on the EGFR. The purified catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAc) stoichiometrically phosphorylated the purified full-length wild type (WT) and kinase negative (K721M) forms of the EGFR. PKAc phosphorylated both WT-EGFR as well as a mutant truncated form of EGFR (Δ1022–1186) exclusively on serine residues. Moreover, PKAc also phosphorylated the cytosolic domain of the EGFR (EGFRKD). Phosphorylation of the purified WT as well as EGFRΔ1022–1186 and EGFRKD was accompanied by decreased autophosphorylation and diminished tyrosine kinase activity. Pretreatment of REF-52 cells with the nonhydrolyzable cAMP analog, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP, decreased EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins as well as activation of the WT-EGFR. Similar effects were also observed in B82L cells transfected to express the Δ1022–1186 form of EGFR. Furthermore, activation of PKAc in intact cells resulted in serine phosphorylation of the EGFR. The decreased phosphorylation of cellular proteins and diminished activation of the EGFR in cells treated with the cAMP analog was not the result of altered binding of EGF to its receptors or changes in receptor internalization. Therefore, we conclude that PKA phosphorylates the EGFR on Ser residues and decreases its tyrosine kinase activity and signal transduction both in vitro andin vivo.

Biochem. 1991; 197: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Upon binding of EGF to its receptor, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) undergoes dimerization and displays tyrosine kinase activity. This leads to autophosphorylation of the EGFR as well as phosphorylation of intracellular substrates (3Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that, in the heart, EGF increases contractility and heart rate by augmenting cAMP accumulation (4Nair B.G. Rashed H.M. Patel T.B. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a result of stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity via activation of Gsα (4Nair B.G. Rashed H.M. Patel T.B.

Parikh B. Milligan G. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21317-21322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, we have also demonstrated that EGF-elicited stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity requires the tyrosine kinase activity of the EGFR and may involve phosphorylation of Gsα (7Nair B.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6947-6951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The cyclic AMP formed in response to EGF can activate the heterotetrameric cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) by binding to its two regulatory subunits, thereby dissociating them from the catalytic subunits (9Walsh D.A. Van Patten S.M. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1227-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAc) can then phosphorylate a variety of intracellular proteins (9Walsh D.A. Van Patten S.M. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1227-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The EGFR is a 170-kDa glycoprotein with a single transmembrane domain. Its intracellular domain is susceptible to phosphorylation on various residues. Thus, the five autophosphorylation sites in the cytosolic domain of EGFR are located at tyrosine residues 992, 1068, 1086, 1148, and 1173 (10Downward J. Parker P. Waterfield M.D. Nature. 1984; 311: 483-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 11Margolis B.L. Lax I. Kris R. Dombalagian M. Honegger A.M. Howk R. Givol D. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 1750-1754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the EGFR is subject to regulation by other kinases. Hence, protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylates the EGFR at Thr-654, thereby decreasing the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the EGFR (13Hunter T. Ling N. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1984; 311: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 14Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9462-9469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-1002 by p34 cdc2 (15Kuppuswamy D. Dalton M. Pike L.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1129-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is likewise associated with inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity. The EGFR can also be phosphorylated on Thr-669 by mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK; Refs. 17Northwood I.C. Gonzalez F.A. Wartmann M. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15266-15276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 18Takishima K. Griswold-Prenner I. Ingebritsen T. Rosner M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S.

In addition, in vivopp60c-src phosphorylates the EGFR on three tyrosines (Tyr-845, -891, and -820) that are not the autophosphorylation sites (19Sato K.-i. Sato Y. Aoto M. Fukami Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Stover D.R. Becker M. Liebetanz J. Lydon N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15591-15597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These novel phosphotyrosines may provide docking sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins, which would explain the enhancement of the mitogenic response to EGF observed in pp60c-src-overexpressing cells (20Stover D.R. Becker M. Liebetanz J. Lydon N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15591-15597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Previous in vitro studies have shown that the EGFR is a substrate for phosphorylation by PKA (21Rackoff W.R. Rubin R.A. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1984; 34: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 22Ghosh-Dastidar P. Fox C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3864-3869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, to date, the functional significance of the phosphorylation has not been described. Since we and others have previously shown that EGF can activate adenylyl cyclase and increase cAMP accumulation in several tissues (4Nair B.G. Rashed H.M. Patel T.B. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,23Nakagowa Y. Gammichia J. Purushotham K.R. Schneyer C.A. Humphreys-Beher M.G. Biochem.

Physiol. 1995; 269: G676-G682PubMed Google Scholar), in the present study we have investigated the possibility that PKA may modulate EGFR tyrosine kinase activity. Our data show that phosphorylation of the EGFR by PKA on serine residues leads to decreased tyrosine kinase activity and diminished autophosphorylation of the EGFR both in vitro and in vivo. Using the procedures described previously (26Hubler L. Levanthal P.S. Bertics P.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 231: 107-114Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) wild type EGFR was purified from A431 cells. Likewise, using the same method (26Hubler L. Levanthal P.S. Bertics P.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 231: 107-114Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the EGFR K721M and EGFRΔ1022–1186 were purified from B82L cells transfected to express these forms of the receptor. The final step in this method involved elution of the EGFR with EGF from an EGFR antibody affinity column. The catalytic subunit of PKA from bovine heart (PKAc; Sigma) was dissolved in a buffer containing 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μm EDTA, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50% ethylene glycol (8000 units/ml). The various forms of purified EGFR (WT, EGFRΔ1022–1186, K721M, and EGFRKD (amino acids 644–1186)) were incubated with 480 units/ml PKAc in 10 μl of phosphorylation buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 mmMgSO4, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mmNaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μm ATP, 50 μm sodium vanadate, and 100 nm EGF (Upstate Biotechnology Inc. or Intergen Co.) for the indicated times at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by addition of 2× Laemmli sample medium and boiling at 100 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels. The samples for autoradiography and phosphoamino acid analyses contained 5 μCi (6000 Ci/mmol) [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) and were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Bands corresponding to the 32P-labeled proteins were excised from polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and subjected to phosphoamino acid analyses as described previously (8Poppleton H. Sun H. Fulgham D. Bertics P. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6947-6951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This was achieved by pursuing two approaches. Both approaches involved decreasing the autophosphorylation of the EGFR. First, we employed the purified, kinase negative form of the EGFR (EGFR K721M; Ref. 27Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C.-P. Walton G.M. Der C.J. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1989; 59: 33-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). This receptor (10 ng) was phosphorylated as described above. In the second approach, the tyrosine kinase activity of the wild type EGFR (100 ng) was inactivated by incubation with 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide (28Gill G.N. Bertics P.J. Thompson D.M. Weber W. Cochet C. Growth Factors and Transformation.in: Feramisco J. Series: Cancer Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1985: 11-18Google Scholar) for 15 min in the phosphorylation buffer described above except that vanadate and dithiothreitol were absent. After addition of dithiothreitol (2 mm) to block further modifications of sulfhydryl groups, PKAc (480 units/ml) and [γ-32P]ATP (10 μm) were added to phosphorylate the EGFR as described above. Following SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide), the bands corresponding to the EGFR were excised, and radioactivity associated with the receptor was determined. From the known specific radioactivity of ATP in the reaction mixture, the moles of phosphate incorporated into known amount of receptor were determined. B82L cells expressing EGFRΔ1022–1186 (12Walton G.M. Chen W.S. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1750-1754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and REF-52 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105cells per 35-mm dish and allowed to grow for 24 h. The cells were then serum starved overnight and treated with 100 μm8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (8-CPT-cAMP; Sigma) for the indicated times before addition of 100 nm EGF. Cells were harvested in 2× Laemmli sample medium, and the samples were boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. An aliquot (20 μl) of the proteins in the Laemmli sample medium was diluted with water (80 μl) and mixed with 400 μl of 0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, to precipitate the SDS. Standards of bovine serum albumin were similarly treated. The supernatant from this mixture was utilized to determine protein concentrations using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay reagent. Equal amounts of protein (15–45 μg) were then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blots were performed as described previously (8Poppleton H. Sun H. Fulgham D. Bertics P. Patel T.B. J. Biol.

Either a polyclonal (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or a monoclonal (PY-20; ICN Biomedicals Inc.) anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (both at 1:1000 dilution) was used. To detect activated EGFR, immunoblots of cellular proteins were performed with anti-active EGFR antibody (Transduction Laboratories). To ensure that equal amounts of proteins from REF-52 cells were loaded on gels, the blots were reprobed with anti-PKAc-α antibody (Santa Cruz). B82L cells (4 × 105 cells per 35-mm dish) expressing the K721M form of the EGFR were treated with and without 8-CPT-cAMP for 30 min. The EGFR was then immunoprecipitated from equal amounts of cell lysates (400 μg of protein) with anti-EGFR antibody (Transduction Laboratories) as described before (7Nair B.G. Patel T.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 1239-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Following separation of proteins in the immunoprecipitate by SDS-PAGE, Western analysis was performed with anti-phosphoserine antibody (clone A49, Alexis Corp., 1:250 dilution) according to the manufacturer instructions. The blot was reprobed with anti-EGFR antibody (Santa Cruz) to ensure that equal amounts of EGFR were immunoprecipitated. Purified WT, EGFRΔ1022–1186, or EGFRKD was preincubated with the indicated amounts of PKAc in phosphorylation buffer described above for 30 min at 30 °C. Thereafter, 1 mm Val-5-angiotensin II (Novabiochem) and 1.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP were added and phosphorylation was allowed to proceed for 10 min at room temperature in a total volume of 25 μl. The reactions were stopped with 25 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation, the supernatants were spotted onto P81 Whatman filter disks, rinsed five times for 2 min each in 75 mm phosphoric acid, dried, and counted for32P incorporation into Val-5-angiotensin II. B82L cells expressing either the WT or Δ1022–1186 forms of EGFR were plated in 24-well plates (30,000 cells/well) and serum starved overnight. The cells were washed with 0.5 ml of ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer modified to contain 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and incubated on ice for 25 min with the same buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Thereafter, 125I-EGF (50 pm) was added, and incubation was continued on ice for a further 2 h. Cells were then washed three times with 0.5 ml of ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer and solubilized in 0.5 ml of 1 N NaOH. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of excess (1 μm), unlabeled EGF. To monitor internalization of the EGFR, the method of Honnegar et al. (29Honnegar A. Dull T.J. Bellot F. Van Obberghen E. Szapary D. Schmidt A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3045-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was pursued. Essentially, following binding of 125I-EGF to cells as described above, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then washed with Krebs-Henseleit buffer as described above. Cell surface-associated 125I-EGF was removed and counted with 0.5 ml ice-cold 0.5 m acetic acid and 150 mmNaCl. Thereafter, cells were washed once with Krebs Henseleit buffer and lysed at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of 1N NaOH to determine the amount of internalized 125I-EGF. Because EGF can increase cAMP accumulation in the heart and other tissues (4Nair B.G. Rashed H.M. Patel T.B. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Nair B.G.

Physiol. 1995; 269: G676-G682PubMed Google Scholar), we postulated that akin to the negative regulation of the EGFR by protein kinase C (14Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9462-9469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (16Countaway J.L. Nairn A.C. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1129-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and p34 cdc2 (15Kuppuswamy D. Dalton M. Pike L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19134-19242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PKA may alter the functional activity of EGFR. To address this hypothesis, initially, we determined the effect of pure PKAc on autophosphorylation of the purified WT and Δ1022–1186 forms of EGFR; in the Δ1022–1186 form of EGFR, four of the five autophosphorylation sites are deleted. Fig.1 A shows that PKAc decreases the incorporation of 32P label from [γ-32P]ATP into the WT-EGFR, whereas 32P incorporation into EGFRΔ 1022–1186 remained unchanged in the presence of PKAc. Similar results, i.e. decreases in32P incorporation, were obtained when the WT-EGFR was incubated with the PKA holoenzyme activated by 8-CPT-cAMP (not shown). This is in contrast with the results of Rackoff et al. (21Rackoff W.R. Rubin R.A. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1984; 34: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and Ghosh-Dastidar et al. (22Ghosh-Dastidar P. Fox C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3864-3869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who showed an increase in32P incorporation from [γ-32P]ATP into the purified EGFR after addition of PKA. Possible explanations for this difference are as follows. First, Rackoff et al. (21Rackoff W.R. Rubin R.A. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1984; 34: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) incubated the EGFR with PKA for just 30–60 s, which may be too short to reach steady state phosphorylation of the EGFR on tyrosine and serine/threonine residues. Second, in the experiments of Rackoffet al. (21Rackoff W.R. Rubin R.A. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1984; 34: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and Ghosh-Dastidar and Fox (22Ghosh-Dastidar P. Fox C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3864-3869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), vanadate, an inhibitor of phosphotyrosine phosphatases was absent. Under these conditions, tyrosine phosphatases, which may co-purify with the EGFR, would decrease tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR, thereby allowing the net increase in PKA-mediated phosphorylation to be monitored. In contrast, in our experiments that employed a longer incubation time and vanadate, the phosphorylation observed with 32P incorporation would represent the sum of tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation of the EGFR. Therefore, to determine whether PKAc altered tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR, experiments similar to those in Fig. 1 A were performed with unlabeled ATP. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western analyses with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As demonstrated by data in Fig.1 B, incubation of the WT-EGFR with PKAc decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor. Similarly, autophosphorylation of the Δ1022–1186 form of the EGFR was also decreased in the presence of PKAc. Thus, the decrease in 32P incorporation in WT-EGFR observed in the presence of PKAc (Fig. 1 A) represents a decrease in autophosphorylation of the receptor. Likewise, because tyrosine phosphorylation of the one site (Tyr-992) on the EGFRΔ1022–1186 is decreased (Fig. 1 B), in the presence of a serine or threonine phosphorylation of this receptor by PKAc, no net change in 32P incorporation would be evident (Fig.1 A), i.e. phosphorylation of one serine or threonine residue by PKAc on EGFRΔ1022–1186 would compensate for the loss of phosphorylation at Tyr-992. To determine whether PKAc phosphorylates serine or threonine residues on the EGFR, phosphoamino acid analyses were performed. Fig.2 A shows that phosphorylation of the WT-EGFR occurs predominantly on serine residues, as also found by Rackoff et al. (21Rackoff W.R. Rubin R.A. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1984; 34: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and Ghosh-Dastidar and Fox (22Ghosh-Dastidar P. Fox C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3864-3869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Fig. 2 A shows that the appearance of phosphoserine in the presence of PKAc is accompanied by a decrease in phosphotyrosine. PKAc also phosphorylates EGFRΔ1022–1186 on serine residues (Fig. 2 B), and this increase in serine phosphorylation is accompanied by the loss of tyrosine phosphorylation. These data support the contention that, in experiments performed with EGFRΔ1022–1186 and [γ-32P]ATP, no net difference in32P incorporation into the receptor is observed in the presence of PKAc (Fig. 1 A, right panel) because of a gain of serine phosphorylation and concomitant loss of tyrosine phosphorylation. Because both the WT and EGFRΔ1022–1186 are phosphorylated on serine residues by PKAc, the data in Fig. 2demonstrate that the PKAc phosphorylation site(s) is(are) not located in the region between amino acids 1022 and 1186. In additional experiments, we determined whether the purified, cytosolic region of the EGFR (amino acids 645–1186; EGFRKD) is also phosphorylated by PKAc. As demonstrated by data in Fig.3 A, phosphorylation of the purified EGFRKD by PKAc resulted in a mobility shift of the EGFRKD on polyacrylamide gels. These data coupled with the findings with the wild type and Δ1022–1186 forms of the EGFR (Figs. 1 and 2) demonstrate that the serine residue(s) on the EGFR, which is(are) phosphorylated by PKAc, resides between amino acids 644 and 1022.Figure 3PKAc phosphorylates the purified cytosolic domain of the EGFR ( EGFRKD ) and stoichiometrically phosphorylates the kinase negative (K721M) form of the EGFR and kinase inactivated WT-EGFR. Panel A, purified, cytosolic domain of the EGFR (10 ng) was incubated in the presence of PKAc (480/ml) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. The phosphorylation of EGFRKD by PKAc alters its migration (indicated by **) on the gel as seen for many phosphoproteins. A representative of three experiments is shown.Panel B, purified EGFR K721M (10 ng) was incubated in the presence of PKAc (480 units/ml, Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP (10 μm) for 10 min at room temperature in the reaction mixture described under “Materials and Methods.” The reactions were terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample medium. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% gels) and subjected to autoradiography. The bands corresponding to EGFR K721M in the presence and absence of PKAc were excised and counted for 32P content. A representative of three similar experiments is shown. Stoichiometry of phosphorylation was 0.74 mol of Pi per mol of EGFR.Panel C, purified EGFR (100 ng) was incubated withN-ethylmaleimide (1 mm) for 15 min as described under “Materials and Methods.” PKAc (480 units/ml) was then added to the incubation containing all ingredients of the phosphorylation mixture. Reactions were terminated after 30 min and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. Autoradiography was performed to detect the phospho-proteins. The EGFR band was excised from the gel, and the32P label incorporated was determined by counting. Stoichiometry of phosphorylation was 0.87 mol of Pi per mol of EGFR. Note that autophosphorylated PKAc is visible on the autoradiographs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the wild type EGFR is phosphorylated both on Tyr as well as Ser residues in the presence of PKAc, and because tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor decreases in the presence of PKAc (Fig. 2, Aand B), the stoichiometry of phosphorylation was difficult to monitor. To circumvent this problem, we employed two approaches. First, phosphorylation of the purified, kinase negative form of the EGFR (EGFR K721M) was monitored. Second, the WT-EGFR was incubated withN-ethylmaleimide to inhibit its tyrosine kinase activity (28Gill G.N. Bertics P.J. Thompson D.M. Weber W. Cochet C. Growth Factors and Transformation.in: Feramisco J. Series: Cancer Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1985: 11-18Google Scholar). Thereafter, the PKAc-mediated phosphorylation was monitored. As demonstrated in Figs. 3, B and C, autophosphorylation of either the K721M form of the EGFR or the wild type receptor in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide was minimal. Under these conditions, PKAc phosphorylated both the kinase negative EGFR (EGFR K721M, Fig. 3 B) and WT-EGFR with a stoichiometry of 0.74 and 0.87 mol of Pi per mol of EGFR, respectively. Because incubation of the WT and Δ1022–1186 forms of EGFR in the presence of PKAc decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of both receptors (Figs. 1 B and 2), it would appear that PKAc-elicited phosphorylation of EGFR on serine residues modulates the tyrosine kinase activity of the EGFR. Therefore, to directly evaluate the functional significance of phosphorylation of EGFR by PKAc, we studied the influence of PKAc on the tyrosine kinase activity of the WT and Δ1022–1186 forms of EGFR. Fig. 4demonstrates that PKAc, in a concentration-dependent manner, inhibited tyrosine kinase activity of both types of EGFR. Moreover, as demonstrated in Fig. 4 C, PKAc also inhibited the tyrosine kinase activity of the EGFRKD. Together, the data in Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 demonstrate that the stoichiometric serine phosphorylation of the EGFR by PKAc is accompanied by a decrease in tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor. Moreover, the site of serine phosphorylation on the EGFR is located between residues 644–1022. Next we investigated whether or not activation of PKA in vivo alters EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins and activation of the EGFR. For this purpose, cells were incubated with 8-CPT-cAMP, a nonhydrolyzable cAMP analog, that activates PKA (30Roger P.P. Reuse S. Maenhout C. Dumont J.E. Vitam. Horm. 1995; 51: 59-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Fig.5 A(i) illustrates that in REF-52 cells, in the absence of 8-CPT-cAMP, the addition of EGF resulted in a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. The most prominent tyrosine phosphorylation in response to EGF was observed in proteins of molecular masses of ∼180 and ∼70 kDa (Fig. 5 A(i)). Treatment of REF-52 cells with 8-CPT-cAMP resulted in a marked decrease in EGF-elicited tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins (Fig. 5 A(i)). The decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in the presence of 8-CPT-cAMP cannot be attributed to differences in protein loading because reprobing the same blot with anti-PKAc antibody showed that the amount of PKAc in each lane was the same (lower panel of Fig. 5 A(i)). Moreover, as assessed with the anti-active EGFR antibody, EGF-elicited activation of the EGFR in REF-52 cells was also markedly attenuated in the presence of 8-CPT-cAMP (Fig. 5 A(ii)); immunoprecipitation of the EGFR from REF-52 cells treated with 8-CPT-cAMP also showed a decrease in EGF-elicited autophosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated EGFR (not shown). Similarly, in B82L cells transfected to express EGFRΔ1022–1186, activation of PKA by 8-CPT-cAMP for different times also led to a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins (Fig.5 B). Thus, 5 min after treatment of cells with 8-CPT-cAMP, a decrease in EGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins was observed (Fig. 5 B). Treatment of these cells with forskolin, which directly activates adenylyl cyclase and increases cAMP levels (31Carpenter G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar), yielded similar results (not shown). To determine whether or not activation of PKA in intact cells phosphorylates the EGFR on serine residues, the experiment depicted in Fig. 5 C was performed. Essentially, B82L cells transfected to express the kinase-negative form of the EGFR (EGFR K721M) were treated with 8-CPT-cAMP for 30 min in the absence of EGF. Thereafter, the cells were lysed, and EGFR was immunoprecipitated. Following separation of proteins in the immunoprecipitate, Western analysis with anti-phosphoserine antibody was performed. As shown in Fig.5 C, treatment of cells with 8-CPT-cAMP resulted in serine phosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated EGFR; the amount of receptor immunoprecipitated from cells treated with and without 8-CPT-cAMP was the same (Fig. 5 C). The data in Fig. 5 demonstrate that activation of PKA in intact cells results in serine phosphorylation of the EGFR, decreased activation of the receptor (Fig.5 A(ii)) and decreased phosphorylation of cellular proteins in response to EGF. Moreover, the data in Fig. 5 Cdemonstrate that activation of PKA in intact cells can phosphorylate the EGFR on serine residues in the absence of EGF. Thus, the EGFR does not have to be activated by its ligand for phosphorylation by PKA. One possible reason for a decrease in autophosphorylation of EGFR in intact cells in the presence of the PKA activator 8-CPT-cAMP is that PKA-elicited phosphorylation of the EGFR may alter binding of EGF to its receptor or enhance receptor internalization, thereby decreasing the number of cell surface EGF receptors. To address this possibility, we monitored the binding of 125I-EGF and internalization of the ligand in B82L cells expressing EGFRΔ1022–1186 that had been pretreated with or without 8-CPT-cAMP. These experiments were performed with 125I-EGF concentrations of 50 pm, theKD of EGFR for EGF, because any change in binding affinity would be most pronounced at this concentration of the ligand. Essentially, our data demonstrated that, in B82L cells expressing EGFRΔ1022–1186, the binding of EGF was not altered (TableI). Likewise, pretreatment of B82L cells expressing EGFRΔ1022–1186 with 8-CPT-cAMP did not alter receptor internalization (Table I). These data indicate that the decrease in EGF-elicited receptor autophosphorylation observed in cells preincubated with 8-CPT-cAMP is not the result of a modification in either EGF binding to its receptors or a change in cell surface EGFR numbers because of receptor internalization. Thus, the effects of PKA activation in intact cells reflect the in vitro findings which demonstrate that PKA, by phosphorylating EGFR on serine residues, decreases its protein-tyrosine kinase activity.Table IActivation of PKA in intact cells does not alter binding of EGF or internalization of the EGF receptorConditionControl+8-CPT-cAMP (100 μm)125I-EGF bound (fmol/30,000 cells)3.8 ± 0.253.3 ± 0.8125I-EGF internalized (fmol/30,000 cells)1.6 ± 0.31.6 ± 0.3B82L cells (30,000 cells per well) expressing the Δ1022–1186 form of the EGF receptor were serum deprived overnight.

Regulation of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity by phosphorylation has been described for PKC (13Hunter T. Ling N. Cooper J.A.

Our data presented here add to the list of protein kinases that regulate EGFR and, for the first time, demonstrate an inhibitory effect of PKA on the early steps of the EGF signaling cascade both in vivoand in vitro. To date, studies of the inhibitory influence of the cAMP-PKA pathway on EGFR signaling have focused mainly on events downstream of Ras, more specifically on MAPK. Thus, it is known that activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway can have inhibitory (32Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 33Wu J. Dent P.

This variability is probably because of the various Raf isoforms expressed in the different cell types (37Erhardt P. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 5524-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, these studies in which intracellular cAMP levels were raised to modulate MAPK activation in response to EGF failed to show an inhibitory effect on WT-EGFR autophosphorylation (32Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 33Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W.

Surgery. 1996; 120: 345-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This is in contrast with our data (Fig. 5) which demonstrate that PKA can interfere with the EGFR signaling cascade at the level of the EGFR itself. One explanation for this discordance may be that the cell lines overexpressing the WT-EGFR, which were used in a number of the studies concerning MAPK activation, may not be suitable for detecting this inhibitory effect of PKA because the amount of EGFR far exceeds the amount of PKA. Indeed, in B82L cells that overexpress the WT-EGFR, we have also not observed any significant decrease in EGF-elicited tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in the presence of 8-CPT-cAMP (not shown). In any event, our findings, together with those of others (32Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 33Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A.

A.). 1993; 90: 10305-10309Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) suggest that, in some cells, PKA can inhibit EGF-mediated activation of MAPK by attenuating both the EGFR kinase as well as interactions of Raf and Ras, and these two mechanisms may act in a mutually reinforcing manner. Interestingly, the EGFR is not the only receptor tyrosine kinase target for regulation by PKA. Hence, pretreatment of cells with cAMP-elevating agents increases serine/threonine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and decreases its insulin-dependent tyrosine kinase activity by 50% (40Stadtmauer L. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3402-3407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This decrease in insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity by cAMP-elevating agents has been confirmed inin vitro experiments which demonstrated that PKA phosphorylates the insulin receptor and decreases its tyrosine kinase activity (41Roth R.A. Beaudoin J. Diabetes. 1987; 36: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These findings coupled with our observations would suggest that PKA may play a more generalized role in regulation of receptor protein-tyrosine kinase signaling. Although, at present, the identity of the serine residue(s) on EGFR which is(are) phosphorylated remains unknown, there are some sites that can be discarded. Thus, because PKA phosphorylates and modulates the activity of the WT-EGFR, EGFR Δ1022–1186, and cytosolic domain (EGFRKD) of the receptor similarly, it would appear that the functionally important serine residue(s) which is(are) phosphorylated and modulates EGFR kinase activity must reside in the cytosolic region,i.e. between amino acids 644 and 1022. Within this region of the EGFR, serine residues 671, 967, 971, and 1002 have been shown to be phosphorylated (15Kuppuswamy D. Dalton M. Pike L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19134-19242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Heisermann G.J. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13152-13158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among these, however, only the phosphorylation of Ser-1002 by p34 cdc2 has been shown to decrease EGFR tyrosine kinase activity (15Kuppuswamy D. Dalton M. Pike L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19134-19242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The functional significance of phosphorylation of Ser-671, -967, and -971 remains to be determined (42Heisermann G.J. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13152-13158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, however, none of these sites including Ser-1002 conforms to the PKA consensus sequence. Nevertheless, the identity of the precise serine residues on EGFR that are phosphorylated by PKA and that alter EGFR kinase activity forms the subject of future investigations. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that PKA can phosphorylate EGFR on serine residue(s) and that this phosphorylation is accompanied by a decrease in EGFR protein-tyrosine kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo. In view of our previous findings that EGFR kinase activity is required to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity (7Nair B.G. Patel T.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 1239-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and increase intracellular cAMP levels (5Nair B.G. Rashed H.M. Patel T.B. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W2111235048,"We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO. Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.

Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar). Activated STAT5 moves to the nucleus where it promotes transcription of target genes by binding to specific STAT5 response sequences. In binding studies, the EPOR has been detected on purified primary human erythroid progenitor cells with one affinity (K d = 0.1 nm) or with two affinities (K d = 0.1 nm and 0.57 nm) for 125I-EPO (7Broudy V.C.

Physiol. 1988; 137: 337-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The significance of two affinities of the EPOR for EPO is not clear. Evidence suggests that there is an accessory component of the EPOR that increases EPO binding affinity (9Hermine O. Dong Y.J. Goldwasser E. Blood. 1994; 84: 811-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Nagao M. Matsumoto S. Masuda S. Sasaki R. Blood. 1993; 81: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Dong Y.J. Goldwasser E. Exp. Hematol. 1993; 21: 483-486PubMed Google Scholar), but this component(s) has yet to be identified. Alternatively, two affinities of the EPOR for EPO may arise from two nonequivalent receptor binding sites on EPO, one of high affinity (∼1 nm) and one of low affinity (∼1 μm), that have been reported for the extracellular domain of the EPOR in solution (12Philo J.S. Aoki K.H. Arakawa T. Owers Narhi L. Wen J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Structurally, the human EPOR is a 484-amino acid glycoprotein with a single transmembrane segment located between extracellular and intracellular domains each of nearly equal size (13Jones S.S. D'Andrea A.D. Haines L.L. Wong G.G. Blood. 1990; 76: 31-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EPOR is a member of a large family of cytokine and growth factor receptors whose ligand binding domains contain homologous sequences and are predicted to be structurally related (14Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). These ligand binding domains consist of approximately 200–250 amino acid residues and contain two subdomains, each predicted to consist of seven β-strands and to be structurally related to fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains (14Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar, 15Bazan J.F. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 350-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal FNIII-like domain contains a pair of spatially conserved cysteine bridges, while the carboxyl-terminal FNIII-like domain contains a conserved β-strand F and a highly conserved WSXWS motif that are hallmarks of receptors of the cytokine receptor family (14Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported the characterization of an EPO-binding protein (EBP), consisting of amino acids 1–225 of the extracellular domain of the mature human EPOR, that was expressed in E. coli in quantity and purity sufficient for site-specific mutagenesis and crystallographic studies (16Johnson D.L.

Recently, the crystal structures of the EBP bound to agonist peptide (EPO-mimetic peptide, EMP1) and an antagonist peptide (EMP33) have been determined (17Livnah O. Stura E.A. Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. Mulcahy L.S. Wrighton N.C. Dower W.J. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1996; 273: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 18Livnah O. Johnson D.L. Stura E.A. Farrell F.X.

EMP1 is a 20-amino acid peptide that is one of a series of related peptides discovered by phage display methodology (19Wrighton N.C. Farrell F.X. Chang R. Kashyap A.K. Barbone F.P. Mulcahy L.S. Johnson D.L. Barrett R.W. Jolliffe L.K. Dower W.J. Science. 1996; 273: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). EMP1 exhibits no homology to EPO, yet binds specifically to the EPOR and mimics the biological effects of EPO both in vitro and in vivo (19Wrighton N.C. Farrell F.X. Chang R. Kashyap A.K. Barbone F.P. Mulcahy L.S. Johnson D.L. Barrett R.W. Jolliffe L.K. Dower W.J. Science. 1996; 273: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The structure of the EBP in the EMP1·EBP complex consists of two domains, each containing seven β-strands arranged in a FNIII-like topology (17Livnah O. Stura E.A. Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. Mulcahy L.S. Wrighton N.C. Dower W.J. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1996; 273: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). This topology for the EBP was also observed in the recently described crystal structure of EBP (EPObp) bound to EPO (20Syed R.S. Reid S.W. Li C. Cheetham J.C. Aoki K.H. Liu B. Zhan H. Osslund T.D. Chirino A.J. Zhang J. Finer-Moore J. Elliott S. Sitney K. Katz B.A. Matthews D.J. Wendoloski J.J. Egrie J. Stroud R.M. Nature. 1998; 395: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The structure of the EBP shows close homology with the structures of ligand binding domains of GHR, prolactin receptor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor, and GP130 (21de Vos A.M.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1665-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), all members of the cytokine receptor family. The EBP also shows structural homology with the extracellular domains of TF (25Muller Y.A. Ultsch M.H. de Vos A.M. J. Mol.

Nature. 1995; 376: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), and even a natural killer cell inhibitory receptor (28Fan Q.R. Mosyak L. Winter C.C. Wagtmann N. Long E.O. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Tissue factor and IFNγRα are “class 2” cytokine receptors (14Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar) in which the seven-β-strand FNIII-like fold is maintained but the relative orientation of the two domains differs. The interaction between EMP1 and EBP consists of two molecules of EMP1 bound by two molecules of EBP to form a two-fold symmetrical assembly, where each peptide interacts with its peptide partner and both receptor molecules (17Livnah O. Stura E.A. Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. Mulcahy L.S. Wrighton N.C. Dower W.J. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1996; 273: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). As a result of this binding symmetry, EBP residues that interact with EMP1 are practically identical for each EBP in the complex. These interactions include hydrophobic contacts with the side chains of Phe93, Met150, and Phe205and a hydrogen-bonding interaction with the side chain of Thr151 of the EBP. The interactions with Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 are among the most significant non-polar contacts in the binding interface in terms of the area of molecular surface buried by each of these residues (17Livnah O. Stura E.A. Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. Mulcahy L.S. Wrighton N.C. Dower W.J. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1996; 273: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Prior to the determination of the EMP1·EBP crystal structure, we investigated what role Phe93 and Met150 might have in EPO binding, based on their predicted secondary structural homologies to the positions of ligand binding determinants in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family (29Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jin R. McMahon F.J. Collins A. Tullai J. Gruninger R.H. Jolliffe L.K. Mulcahy L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14045-14054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Phe93 was found to be critical for EPO binding, while Met150 was found to be relatively unimportant. In the present study, we used the alanine substitution mutants at Phe93 and Met150 to determine if these residues contribute significantly to EMP1 binding. In addition, further alanine substitution mutants were created at EBP residues Thr151and Phe205. These residues were selected for mutagenesis, based on their contacts with EMP1 in the EMP1·EBP crystal structure and on predicted secondary structural homologies to the positions of ligand binding determinants in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family. Furthermore, these residues contact EPO in the recently reported EPO·EPObp crystal structure (20Syed R.S. Reid S.W. Li C. Cheetham J.C. Aoki K.H. Liu B. Zhan H. Osslund T.D. Chirino A.J. Zhang J. Finer-Moore J. Elliott S. Sitney K. Katz B.A. Matthews D.J. Wendoloski J.J. Egrie J. Stroud R.M. Nature. 1998; 395: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, while Thr151 appears to be unimportant for the binding of these ligands. In contrast, Met150, which is relatively unimportant for EPO binding, is critical for EMP1 binding. Thus, some of the same residues on the EPOR are important for binding two very different ligands, EPO and EMP1, suggesting that these residues may be required for productive ligand binding to the EPOR. The bacterial expression, purification, and characterization of the 225-amino acid extracellular domain of the EPOR (referred to here as an EBP) has been described in detail elsewhere (16Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee W.-H. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Exp. Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Biophysical analysis indicated that the purified EBP contained the expected amino terminus, disulfide-bridging pattern, and molecular mass. The EBP exhibited a low nanomolar binding affinity (K d = 5 nm) for EPO. Mutagenesis of the EBP was performed as described previously (29Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jin R. McMahon F.J. Collins A. Tullai J. Gruninger R.H. Jolliffe L.K. Mulcahy L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14045-14054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and the concentrations of purified wild-type and mutant EBP were estimated using the experimentally determined extinction coefficient of the wild-type EBP of 2.3 absorbance units/mg/ml at 280 nm (16Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee W.-H. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Exp. Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Gross structural characterization of the F205A-EBP by circular dichroism (CD) was performed as described previously (29Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jin R. McMahon F.J. Collins A. Tullai J. Gruninger R.H. Jolliffe L.K. Mulcahy L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14045-14054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Competition binding assays in which wild-type or mutant EBP compete for 125I-EPO binding with EPOR on the surface of TF-1 cells were performed as described (30Johnson D.L. Farrell F.X. Barbone F.P. McMahon F.J. Tullai J. Hoey K. Livnah O. Wrighton N.C. Middleton S.A. Loughney D.A. Stura E.A. Dower W.J. Mulcahy L.S. Wilson I.A. Jolliffe L.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3699-3710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Equilibrium binding experiments on the wild-type and mutant EBP were carried out using a surface plasmon resonance assay on a BIAcore 2000 instrument. Proteins were coupled to the carboxymethylated dextran surface using amine coupling chemistry. The derivatization levels were ∼3,000 resonance units. Different concentrations of either EPO or EMP1 were injected over all four flow cells sequentially at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The surfaces were regenerated with a 1-min pulse of 10 mmsodium acetate, pH 4.0. Each chip had one negative control surface and one surface containing wild-type EBP. To calculate the dissociation constants, the change in the equilibrium amount of ligand bound as a function of the concentration of ligand was fit to the equation for a simple 1:1 binding model, R=(Rmax×[ligand])/(Kd+[ligand]),Equation 1 or to a model for two independent binding sites R=(Rmax1×[ligand])/(Kd1+[ligand])+Equation 2 (Rmax2×[ligand])/(Kd2+[ligand]),where R is the response, R maxis the maximum response, and K d is the dissociation constant. The ability of EMP1 to mediate the dimerization of wild-type and mutant EBP was evaluated in chemical cross-linking assays using the sulfhydryl-reactive cross-linking reagent (1,4-di- (3′-(2′-pyridyldithio) propionamido)butane (DPDPB; Pierce). The assay was performed as described previously (17Livnah O. Stura E.A. Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. Mulcahy L.S. Wrighton N.C. Dower W.J. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1996; 273: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 30Johnson D.L. Farrell F.X. Barbone F.P. McMahon F.J. Tullai J. Hoey K. Livnah O. Wrighton N.C. Middleton S.A. Loughney D.A.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3699-3710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), except that the reaction products were detected and quantified using high performance-size exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC). Briefly, wild-type or mutant EBP (11 μm) were incubated with a variable concentration of EMP1 (stock prepared in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and 0.5 mmDPDPB (stock prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide) in 75 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 4 h at room temperature then overnight at 4 °C. All reactions and controls contained a final concentration of 4.4% Me2SO and 0.007% trifluoroacetic acid to improve the solubility of the cross-linker. The samples were analyzed by HP-SEC on a Waters 625 HPLC system equipped with a Waters 996 detector. Separations were performed at room temperature on a 7.8 × 300-mm G3000 SWXL column (Supelco, Bellfonte, PA). The column was equilibrated in 10 mmNa2PO4, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and was monitored at 220 nm. Under these conditions, EBP eluted at ∼9.6 min, while the dimer product eluted earlier at ∼8.9 min. These elution times correspond toM r ∼25,000 for EBP monomer andM r ∼52,000 for the dimer product based on calibration of the column using a commercial HP-SEC standard mixture (16Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee W.-H. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Exp. Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The percentage of dimer product formed was calculated by adding the integrator determined peak area for the monomer and dimer protein peaks to determine total protein peak area. The dimer area value was divided by the total protein peak area and multiplied by 100 to yield the percentage of dimer observed in each reaction mixture. The reported value for each concentration is the average over three different chromatographic separations, and the error bars are the standard deviation value for the three experiments. For expression in COS7 cells, the various mutants were subcloned from the EBP bacterial expression plasmid pSAM3 (16Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee W.-H. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Exp. Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) to a mammalian expression plasmid encoding the full-length human EPOR in pSG5 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Transient transfection of COS7 cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) was performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids encoding the wild-type or mutant (F93A, M150A, or F205A) forms of the human EPOR along with a plasmid encoding STAT5a (pME18S-STAT5a, kindly provided by Dr. Alice Mui, DNAX Research Institute). Stimulations were performed for 10 min at 37 °C with either EPO or EMP1 at the stated concentrations. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using nuclear extracts prepared from resting or stimulated cells and an oligonucleotide probe containing the FcγRI STAT response sequence, as described previously (31Gaffen S. Lai S.Y. Xu W. Gouillex F. Groner B. Goldsmith M.A. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7192-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Previously, we expressed the extracellular domain of the human EPOR as a soluble EBP in E. coli (16Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee W.-H. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Exp. Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1) revealed several EBP residues that form significant contacts with the peptide (17Livnah O. Stura E.A. Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. Mulcahy L.S. Wrighton N.C. Dower W.J. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1996; 273: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). These include major nonpolar interactions with the side chains of Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bond with the side-chain hydroxyl group of Thr151(Fig. 1). Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 of the EBP along with TyrP4, PheP8, TrpP13, and CysP15 of the peptide form a hydrophobic core at the heart of the interaction between EBP and EMP1 (Ref. 17Livnah O. Stura E.A. Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. Mulcahy L.S. Wrighton N.C. Dower W.J. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1996; 273: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar; Fig. 1). The hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Thr151 is part of a network of mostly main-chain hydrogen bonds formed with main-chain atoms of the type I β-turn of the peptide (Fig. 1). To determine if Thr151 and Phe205 contribute significantly to EPO binding, these residues were replaced with alanine and the resultant mutant proteins were purified and tested for their ability to compete for 125I-EPO binding with EPOR on the surface of TF-1 cells. Alanine was chosen as the replacement residue, since it is likely to result in a loss of interactions from the original side chain without introducing new interactions or gross structural changes (32Ward W.H.J. Timms D. Fersht A.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 280-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The T151A-EBP exhibited an IC50 of 6.5 nm in this assay, nearly identical to the wild-type value of 3.5 nm, indicating that Thr151 does not contribute significantly to EPO binding (Fig. 2). In contrast, the F205A-EBP does not compete for EPO in this assay except at very high concentrations. About 45% inhibition of 125I-EPO binding to the cells was observed at the highest concentration of F205A-EBP tested (10 μm; Fig. 2). Thus, the F205A-EBP exhibits an IC50 > 10 μm in this assay compared with the wild-type value of 3.5 nm, suggesting that this mutation results in a dramatic decrease in the ability to bind EPO. Competition binding analyses were also performed on the F93A- and M150A-EBP. Similar to the F205A-EBP, the F93A-EBP exhibited about 45% inhibition of 125I-EPO binding at 10 μm (Fig. 2) and, thus, also has an IC50 > 10 μm in this assay. The M150A-EBP bound EPO as well as wild-type, exhibiting an IC50 of 3.5 nm. These results suggest that Phe93 and Phe205 are critical for EPO binding, while Met150 and Thr151 are relatively unimportant for EPO binding. We have previously shown that the dramatic reduction in EPO binding in the F93A-EBP is not a result of gross structural changes caused by the mutation (29Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jin R. McMahon F.J. Collins A. Tullai J. Gruninger R.H. Jolliffe L.K. Mulcahy L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14045-14054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To investigate the possible structural consequences of the F205A mutation, CD was used to evaluate the overall secondary structure and thermal denaturation of the F205A-EBP relative to the wild type. The F205A-EBP produced a CD spectrum similar to wild type except for reduced intensity in the 200–220-nm region (Fig.3 A) and resulted in a small (∼5 °C) decrease in thermal stability relative to the wild-type EBP (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, the limited differences in CD spectrum and decrease in Tm of the F205A-EBP indicate that this mutation does not cause significant changes in the global secondary structure or the stability of the EBP. To determine an EPO binding affinity (K d) for the EBP mutants, equilibrium binding analyses were performed on the wild-type and mutant EBP using surface plasmon resonance. As can be seen in Fig. 4 A, the EPO binding curves for the M150A- and T151A-EBP were similar to wild type. The data for the wild-type and T151A-EBP fit best to a two-site model (see “Experimental Procedures”), yielding a high affinityK d of ∼5 nm and a low affinityK d of ∼900 nm for EPO. For the M150A-EBP, however, the two-site fit of the data gave no improvement over the 1:1 model. This mutant exhibited a singleK d for EPO of 36 nm, only slightly increased relative to the high affinity (5 nm)K d of the wild-type EBP. In contrast, the F205A-EBP exhibited a dramatically increased K d of 1 μm relative to wild-type EBP (Fig. 4 A). The difference between the 1 μm K d and the >10 μm IC50 for EPO observed for the F205A-EBP (see above) might be expected, since competitive binding data (IC50) are not directly comparable to equilibrium binding data (K d). Furthermore, in the competition binding format, the EBP mutants compete for EPO binding with cell surface wild-type EPOR exhibiting a K d for EPO of 400 pm (34Kitamura T. Tange T. Terasawa T. Chiba S. Kuwaki T. Miyagawa K. Piao Y.-F. Miyazono K. Urabe A. Takaku F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Less active mutants might compete poorly if at all with the high affinity EPOR, leading to increased IC50values relative to K d values from a direct binding assay. In any case, the 1 μm K d of the F205-EBP represents a decrease in binding affinity of about 200-fold from the 5 nm K d of the wild type, confirming the results of the competition binding experiments that Phe205 is an important EPO binding determinant. The F93A-EBP showed no binding to EPO over the concentration range studied (1 nm to 10 μm; Fig. 4A), confirming that Phe93 is also an important EPO binding determinant of the EPOR (29Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jin R. McMahon F.J. Collins A. Tullai J. Gruninger R.H. Jolliffe L.K. Mulcahy L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14045-14054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance was also used to examine EMP1 binding affinities of the wild-type and mutant EBP. The sensorgrams for EMP1 binding at a concentration of 1 μm are shown in Fig.4 B. The F93A-, M150A-, and F205A-EBP did not show specific binding to EMP1 above the background seen for an underivatized surface or surfaces coated with unrelated proteins (leptin and leptin receptor). Only the T151A-EBP bound EMP1, showing a response similar to that of wild type (Fig. 4 B). In binding curves generated at various concentrations of EMP1 (0.1–10 μm), the wild-type and T151A-EBP had comparable affinities for EMP1 of ∼350 nm (data not shown). This value is similar to the half-maximal response (EC50) of 400 nm reported for EMP1 in cell proliferation assays (19Wrighton N.C. Farrell F.X. Chang R. Kashyap A.K. Barbone F.P. Mulcahy L.S.

https://openalex.org/W2035278697,"To identify mechanisms whereby activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) alters the radiation resistance of human melanoma cells, we examined the possible role of ATF2 in UVC-induced apoptosis. Forced expression of full-length or truncated (Δ1–195 amino acids) forms of ATF2 in LU1205, a late-stage human melanoma cell line, elevated the levels of UVC-induced apoptosis. At the same time, either truncated or full-length forms of ATF2 reduced UVC-induced activation of the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) promoter and decreased expression of TNFα. Forced expression of c-Jun in ATF2-expressing melanoma cells restored TNFα expression, suggesting that both forms of ATF2 sequestered transcription factors that positively regulate TNFα expression in response to UV irradiation. Antagonistic antibodies to Fas, but not to TNFR1, efficiently suppressed UVC-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the Fas pathway mediates the primary apoptotic signal in melanoma cells whereas the TNFR1 pathway elicits a survival signal. Indeed, treatment of melanoma cells with TNFα before UVC irradiation partially suppressed UVC-induced apoptosis, further supporting the protective role of TNFα in UVC-treated melanoma cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that ATF2 contributes to UVC-induced apoptosis through transcriptional silencing of TNFα, which balances Fas-mediated cell death in melanoma."

A1ARs are expressed very early in embryonic development, and A1ARs are among the earliest expressed G protein coupled receptors in the heart and brain. To understand the biologic basis of A1AR expression, a genomic fragment containing the murine A1AR promoter was cloned. Reporter assay studies using DDT1 MF2 cells that express A1ARs revealed that 500 base pairs of the proximal A1AR promoter contained essential elements for A1AR gene expression. Transgenic mice with A1AR proximal promoter coupled with the β-galactosidase reporter gene had heavy labeling of the brain and atria, consistent with normal patterns of A1AR expression. Within the proximal A1AR promoter, putative binding sites for cardiac transcription factors GATA and Nkx2.5 were identified. Co-expression studies revealed that GATA-4 and Nkx2.5 could individually drive A1AR promoter activity and act synergistically to activate A1AR expression. These observations suggest that embryonic A1AR expression involves activation of the A1AR promoter by GATA-4 and Nkx2.5.

Each adenosine receptor subtype has distinct ligand binding properties and different patterns of tissue expression (1Olah M.E. Stiles G.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 581-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A1 adenosine receptors (A1ARs) are widely distributed in the central nervous system and act to influence neuronal function, neurotransmitter release, and protect against seizure activity and cerebral ischemia (2Brundege J.M. Dunwiddie T.V. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 39: 353-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 3Higgins M.J. Hosseinzadeh H. MacGregor D.G. Ogilvy H. Stone T.W. Pharm. World Sci. 1994; 16: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A1ARs are also expressed in the heart, where their activation protects the myocardium against ischemia and can terminate supraventricular arrhythmias (4Shryock J.C. Belardinelli L. Am. J. Cardiol. 1997; 79: 2-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 5Linden J. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2668-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Recent evidence shows that A1AR expression begins at very early stages of development (6Rivkees S.A. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 89: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, A1ARs are expressed in neurons during periods of active neurogenesis and neuronal migration (6Rivkees S.A. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 89: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Brain regions with high levels of A1AR expression at early stages include the hippocampus, cerebellum, and hindbrain (6Rivkees S.A. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 89: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A1ARs are expressed at even earlier stages in the myocardium when the heart is a primitive cardiac cylinder that has not begun beating, making A1ARs the earliest known expressed GPCR in the heart (6Rivkees S.A. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 89: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 7Hofman P.L. Hiatt K. Yoder M.C. Rivkees S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R1374-R1380PubMed Google Scholar). Presently, our understanding of the factors that regulate A1AR gene expression is at early stages. The human A1AR gene promoter has been isolated and examined (8Ren H. Stiles G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4864-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Ren H. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 975-980PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ren H. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The 5′-untranslated region of the human A1AR gene contains two promoter elements, designated “A” and “B,” that are separated by an intron (9Ren H. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 975-980PubMed Google Scholar). The A and B promoters are believed to have nonclassical TATA boxes (A, TTAAGAC; B, TTTAAA), and the B promoter is more active than the A promoter (9Ren H. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 975-980PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that nuclear proteins bind to AGG motifs in the promoter A region, although the identity of these proteins is unknown (10Ren H. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Recognizing the unique temporal and spatial patterns of A1AR expression, there is considerable interest in identifying the factors that influence A1AR gene expression. To provide additional insights into the factors that regulate A1AR expression, we have isolated and characterized the murine A1AR promoter (mA1ARp). We now show that 500 bp of the proximal mA1ARp contains motifs responsible for A1AR expression in the brain and heart and that the transcriptional activating factors GATA-4 and Nkx2.5 potently induce mA1ARp activation. A murine genomic 129/SVJ library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was screened with a 32P-labeled probe generated from a 400-bp fragment from the 5′-end of the rat A1AR cDNA (11Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Stehle J.H. Rivkees S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). A positive clone of 4.5 kilobases was isolated and purified using the polyethylene glycol (Mr 8000) precipitation method. The phage insert was subcloned into aKpnI site in Bluescript-SKII+ (Stratagene; La Jolla, CA), mapped by restriction digestion, and sequenced in both directions. The −502 to +35 mA1ARp fragment was subcloned into the pNLAC vector (12Hoyle G.W. Mercer E.H. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The construct was then digested with KpnI andPstI, and the mA1AR-pNLAC DNA was gel purified (Qiagen; Santa Clarita, CA). The purified fragment was microinjected into the pronuclei of fertilized eggs (C57/BL6) at the Yale Transgenic Center. Injected eggs were implanted into pseudopregnant recipient mice. Offspring were screened for the presence of the transgenes by PCR amplification of DNA from tail biopsies using oligonucleotide primer pairs CCGTGCATCTGCCAGTTGAG (mA1ARp) and TGGGGCAGTCGATCGGTAAGGATTC (nLAcZ). PCR conditions consisted of 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. PCR products were then separated on a 1.2% agarose gel. β-Galactose staining was examined in whole-mount embryo specimens from timed pairings of male founders with wild-type female mice as described (12Hoyle G.W. Mercer E.H. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Behringer R.R. Crotty D.A. Tennyson V.M. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Wolgemuth D.J. Development. 1993; 117: 823-833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Embryos were dissected from the uteri and placed in individual wells in 12-well plates that contained ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Corresponding amniotic membranes were saved for PCR genotyping. Embryos were fixed in 0.25% glutaraldehyde for 30 min on ice. Specimens were next washed three times for 30 min in PBS. Specimens were then incubated in PBS staining solution containing 2 mm MgS04, 5 mmK3Fe(CN)6, 5 mmK4Fe(CN)6, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, and 1.0 mg/ml X-gal. Specimens were then incubated overnight at 37 °C. The next day, specimens were washed in PBS and stored at 4 °C until microscopic examination. After staining, some specimens were frozen in chilled (−20 °C) 2-methylbutane, stored at −80°, and sectioned in a cryostat (10 μm), and tissue sections were examined. cDNA libraries were constructed from DDT1 MF-2 cell mRNA using the 5′-RACE system (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) (14Kriangkum J. Vainshtein I. Elliott J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3793-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Single-stranded cDNAs were synthesized using the antisense gene-specific primer 1 (GSP1; ATAAGGATGGCCAGTGGGATGAC) located 190 bp 5′ of the initiator methionine ATG codon. The cDNAs were tailed at the 3′-end with poly(A)+ using terminal transferase and then amplified by the PCR reaction using the specific anchor oligonucleotides and the GSP2 antisense primer (GACCAAGGCAATGAGCACCTCGA), which is 40 bp 5′ of the initiator methionine codon. The amplified products were then subcloned into the pCR2.1 vector using the Invitrogen TA Cloning System (Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced. Ribonuclease mapping was performed with an RPA II kit from Ambion (Houston, TX) (15Gutkowska J. Tremblay J. Antakly T. Meyer R. Mukaddam-Daher S. Nemer M. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A 210-bp fragment of mA1AR genomic DNA that was 720–510 bp upstream of the initiator methionine was isolated by PCR (forward primer CCATCCAGTCACTAGTACGAAACAGGG; reverse primer, CTATATAAGCTTATCCTGCCTGCCAACCGGTA) was subcloned into Bluescript SKII+ (Stratagene), linearized, and transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to yield a 32P-labeled riboprobe that was gel purified. Twenty-five micrograms of total RNA from DDT1 MF-2 cells were hybridized with the riboprobe at 45 °C for 20 h and digested with 100-fold diluted RNase solution at 37 °C for 30 min. The protected products were analyzed by 8 m urea, 7% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 32P-labeled andHaeIII-digested X174 RFI DNA to determine the sizes of the products. All constructs were prepared by ligation of PCR-generated DNA fragments into the pGL3-Basic expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR products were generated using the full-length mA1ARp construct as a template. PCR conditions consisted of 25 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min using Roche Molecular Biochemicals Taq polymerase (Indianapolis, IN). PCR products were then separated on a 1.2% agarose gel and gel-eluted (Quiex II kit; Qiagen) before digestion with restriction endonucleases and ligation into pGL3. For isolation of the −502 to + 35 construct, the forward primer was AACTGGCTAGCCCTGGGTTC, and the reverse primer was TCCCAGCCCGGCCTTTC. Specific mutations were made by the PCR overlap-extension method of Hoet al. (16Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). To generate the front part of mutant promoters, oligonucleotide primer pairs (primers A and B) were designed to generate a 5′-fragment of the mA1ARp. Another set of oligonucleotide primer pairs (primers C and D) were designed to generate a 3′-fragment of the mA1ARp receptor. B and C primers contained sequences that encoded for the desired mutations. PCR reactions were performed to generate A-B and C-D fragments, which were gel-eluted. Receptor fragments (A-B and C-D) were then combined in a third PCR reaction to generate a full-length A1AR using flanking primers (A and D). Flanking PCR primers contained restriction endonuclease sites for subcloning into PGL3. Mutant constructs were then sequenced. DDT1 MF-2, MDCK, HELA, and HepG2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were grown in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. All media were supplemented to final concentrations of 50 IU/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air incubator at 37 °C. On the day before transfection, cells were passaged into 12-well plates (22-mm per dish) so they would be about 70% confluent the next morning. Transient cell transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.); 1 μg of each test plasmid and 0.2 μg of the control plasmid pRL-CMV carrying the Renilla luciferase gene downstream of the CMV promoter were added to the medium. The next day, cells were washed twice with PBS, collected in a microcentrifuge, and incubated in 300 μl of cell lysis solution (Promega). The supernatant obtained by centrifugation for 5 min was used to measure firefly and Renilla luciferase activities. Luciferase activity was measured on 15 μl of cell extract using a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale CA) using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Firefly luciferace activity was expressed relative to Renilla luciferase activity for all test constructs. Each sample was tested in quadruplicate. Each study was repeated at least four separate times. Radioligand binding studies were performed using intact cells as described (6Rivkees S.A. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 89: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Stehle J.H. Rivkees S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), using [3H]DPCPX (NEN Life Science Products; specific activity, 100 Ci/mmol). All determinations were done in quadruplicate. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (17Engeland K. Andrews N.C. Mathey-Prevot B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24572-24579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cultured cells were suspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenates were chilled on ice for 15 min, and then 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 were added. After vigorous vortexing for 10 s, the nuclear fraction was precipitated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min and suspended in 100 μl of buffer B (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The mixture was left on ice for 15 min with frequent agitation. Nuclear extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentration was determined using bicinchoninic acid (Pierce). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed as described (18Cheskis B. Lemon B.D. Uskokovic M. Lomedico P.T. Freedman L.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1814-1824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Scott V. Clark A.R. Docherty K. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 31: 339-347PubMed Google Scholar). DNA-protein reactions were performed for 30 min at 30 °C in a mixture (20 μl) containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg of poly(deoxyinosine-deoxycytidine) (dI-dC), 0.1–0.4 ng 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe, and nuclear miniextracts (2–8 μg of protein). Where indicated, the reaction was performed in the presence of unlabeled oligonucleotide competitors. DNA-protein complexes were electrophoresed on 4% PAGE containing 6.7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3.3 mm sodium acetate, 2.5% glycerol, and 0.1 mm EDTA. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. Supershift assays using antibody to GATA 4 (sc-1237x; Santa Cruz Bitotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA) were preformed by incubating 0.5–2.0 μg of the antibody with 100 μg of the nuclear extract for 1 h at 4 °C. Nuclear extracts where incubated with32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes as described above. Sequences of oligonucleotides used in these studies were: GATA, TCTGGGGATACTTGGCTAGAC; mutated GATA, TCTGGGGTTACTTGGCTAGAC; “A” region, CTTCTGTCACGAATGGGGCACC; mutated “A” region, CTTCTGTTAAGAATGGGGCACC. ANOVA was used to test for differences among groups in luciferase reporter studies. To isolate the mA1ARp, a 129SVJ murine genomic library (CLONTECH) was screened using a probe generated from the 5′-coding region of the rat A1AR. Library screening resulted in the isolation of a 4.5-kilobase genomic fragment that was sequenced in full. The 3′-region of the genomic fragment contained 700 bp that was identical to the reported sequence of the murine A1AR (250 bp noncoding and 300 bp coding) (20Marquardt D.L. Walker L.L. Heinemann S. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4508-4515PubMed Google Scholar). At 742 and 685 bp upstream of the initiator methionine site, sequences that were identical to the human A1AR promoter “A” (TTAAGA) and “B” (TTTAAA) motifs were identified (Fig.1). We next determined the transcription start site of the mA1ARp using complementary methods of 5′-RACE and RNase mapping. mRNA from DDT1 MF-2 cells, which is a Syrian hamster myocyte cell line that expresses A1ARs at high levels (21Ramkumar V. Olah M.E. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 639-647PubMed Google Scholar), was used in these studies. In our hands, the concentration of A1ARs in DDT1 MF2 cells is 253 ± 12 fmol/mg whole cell protein. Using 5′-RACE and RNase mapping, we identified a similar transcription start site 560 bp upstream of the initiation codon. Only one transcription start site was identified with each method. To identify regions of the mA1ARp involved in control of A1AR gene expression, the expression of a series of mA1ARp-luciferase constructs was examined. The mA1ARp fragments were subcloned into the pGL3 reporter vector (Promega; Madison WI); different cell types were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). To control for transfection efficiency, cells were co-transfected with a Renilla control reporter vector (pRL-CMV; Promega). To examine the specificity of the observed responses, studies were performed in HeLa and HEPG2 cells that do not express A1ARs and in DDT1 MF2 and MDCK cells that do express A1ARs (DDT1 MF-2, 236 ± 19 fmol/mg protein; MDCK, 45 ± 9 fmol/mg protein). Although we saw reporter expression in all cell types in which luciferase activity was driven by a control CMV-luciferase promoter (CMV-PGL3; Promega), no reporter expression was seen for any of the mA1ARp fragments tested in HEPG2 or HeLa cells (n = 4 separate studies using reporter constructs shown in Fig. 2). In contrast, we saw specific reporter activity after we transfected the DDT1 MF-2 and MDCK cells with mA1ARp gene fragments (Fig. 2). Next, the expression of a broad series of mA1ARp truncation constructs was examined in DDT1 MF-2 cells. With progressive deletion of the 5′ region of the A1ARp, reporter activity increased (Fig. 2). Additional truncation studies showed that, when base pairs from −500 to −250 were deleted, reporter expression declined (Fig.3). Because in vitro truncation reporter studies indicated that the proximal 500 bp of the mA1AR promoter resulted in high levels of reporter expression in cells that contain A1ARs, we next tested if this region played a role in A1AR expression in vivo. The proximal mA1ARp (−502 to +35) fragment was thus linked with a previously characterized β-galactosidase reporter construct for generation of transgenic mice (12Hoyle G.W. Mercer E.H. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Behringer R.R. Crotty D.A. Tennyson V.M. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Wolgemuth D.J. Development. 1993; 117: 823-833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The construct was injected into 100 murine oocytes that were then implanted into the uteri of pseudo-pregnant female mice. Forty mice were subsequently born, four males of which were positive for the mA1ARp-nlacZ transgene and were studied. To analyze patterns of reporter gene expression during early development, founder males were mated with wild-type females. β-Galactosidase activity was examined in embryos, which were genotyped by PCR. In the embryos that were positive for the transgene (from two lines 5163 and 5174), a blue reaction product was present over the brain, spinal cord, and atria between PC 8.5–13 (Fig.4). In contrast, no color reaction was seen in littermates that did not express the transgene (Fig. 4). This pattern of expression is identical to that seen by in situhybridization or receptor-labeling autoradiography (6Rivkees S.A. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 89: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Next, we attempted to identify motifs within the proximal mA1ARp (−502 to +35) where transcription factors may bind. When we examined sequences within this region, we identified putative GATA, Nkx2.5 binding sites, and a potential TATA box. At position −434, a GGATAC motif was identified. This motif differs from the classical GATA binding motif of (A/T)GATA(A/G), but is shown to bind GATA proteins (22Ko L.J. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4011-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 23Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). At position −243, the sequence TTAAGAA was identified, which is similar to the Nkx2.5 binding motif TNAAGTA (24Chen C.Y. Croissant J. Majesky M. Topouzis S. McQuinn T. Frankovsky M.J. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Genet. 1996; 19: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,25Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15628-15633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This motif is similar to the “A” promoter of the human A1ARp. At −85, the motif TTTAAA was identified that corresponds with the “B” promoter of the human A1ARp. To test the roles of these motifs on promoter activity, each was mutated and reporter assays were performed. Following conversion of the GATA motif to GTTA, reporter activity was markedly reduced (Fig.5). Following conversion of the TTAAGAA motif to TTATGAA, reporter activity was reduced by 50% (Fig. 5). Following conversion of TTTAAA to TCTACA, reporter activity was reduced by 70% (Fig. 5). Because GATA-4 and Nkx2.5 are important for heart development (26Lints T.J. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Lyons I. Harvey R.P. Development. 1993; 119: 419-431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the mA1ARp contains putative GATA and Nkx2.5 binding sites, we next tested if GATA-4 and Nkx2.5 influence mA1ARp expression. A1ARp activity was thus examined after co-transfection with constructs driving the expression of GATA-4 or Nkx2.5 (provided by Dr. Robert Schwartz). These studies were performed in DDT1 MF-2 and HeLa cells. In each cell line, co-expression of GATA-4 with −502 to +35 mA1ARp reporter constructs resulted in 20–40-fold increases in receptor expression for the constructs containing the GATA binding motif (Fig.6). However, when the GATA motif was mutated to GTTA, there was no increased reporter activity (Fig. 6). Following co-expression of Nkx2.5 with the mA1ARp reporter construct, mA1ARp reporter activity increased 15-fold (Fig. 6). However, when the Nkx2.5 motif was mutated to TCTACA, increased reporter activity was not seen (Fig. 6). We also tested if Nkx2.5 and GATA-4 acted synergistically to drive A1AR expression, similar to that observed for the atrial natriuretic factor promoter (27Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 28Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Co-transfection studies were therefore performed by transfecting cells with amounts of Nkx2.5 and GATA-4 expression constructs that individually did not induce reporter expression (Fig.7). The studies showed that Nkx2.5 and GATA-4 acted synergistically to induce mA1ARp expression (Fig. 7). EMSA assays were next performed to test if the putative GATA and Nkx2.5 binding motifs interact with nuclear proteins. When a radiolabeled 20-bp oligonucleotide containing the GATA binding motif was incubated with DDT-MF2 cell nuclear extracts, one prominent band was seen (Fig. 8). When studies were performed with increasing concentrations of unlabeled oligonucleotides, the amount of radioactivity of the band decreased (Fig. 8). When the GATA site was mutated to GTTA, the amount of labeling of the band was markedly reduced (Fig. 8). When antibody against GATA-4 was added to the nuclear extracts, the size of the band representing the protein-DNA complex was shifted to a higher molecular weight (Fig. 8). When a radiolabeled 20-bp oligonucleotide containing the Nkx2.5 binding motif was incubated with DDT1 MF-2 cell nuclear extracts, one prominent band was seen (Fig. 9). When studies were performed with increasing concentrations of unlabeled oligonucleotides, the amount of radioactivity of the band decreased (Fig. 9). When the Nkx2.5 site in the competitor oligonucleotide was mutated to TCTACA, the amount of labeling was not reduced (Fig. 9). Because Nkx2.5 antibody was not available to us, we did not perform Nkx2.5 supershift studies. To begin to identify the factors that regulate the expression of A1ARs, we isolated the murine A1AR promoter. Showing that the genomic fragment isolated contained a murine A1AR promoter, patterns of β-galactosidase expression in mA1ARp-nlacZ mice were temporally and spatially similar to patterns of A1AR expression seen in rodents (6Rivkees S.A. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 89: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). When we compared human and murine A1AR promoter sequences, we detected several similarities among the genes, further supporting the notion that we isolated a murine A1AR promoter. In the human A1ARp, two promoter motifs designated “A” and “B” have been identified and shown to represent distinct transcriptional start sites (9Ren H. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 975-980PubMed Google Scholar). In the murine A1AR promoter, we identified identical motifs that were separated by 160 bp, whereas these motifs are separated by 650 bp in the human gene (9Ren H. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 975-980PubMed Google Scholar). Based on our mA1ARp truncation, mutation, and gel-shift studies, we believe that the “A” motif is a Nkx2.5 binding site. The “B” motif appears to be an unconventional TATA box similar to that reported for other genes (29Fenton S.E. Groce N.S. Lee D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30870-30878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30Mullick J. Addya S. Sucharov C. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13729-13742Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Whereas there is evidence for two transcriptional start sites in the human A1ARp, we only observed one transcriptional start site for the murine A1AR promoter. To characterize the mA1ARp, reporter assays were performed using Syrian hamster smooth muscle DDT1 MF-2 cells since they express A1ARs at high levels (21Ramkumar V. Olah M.E. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 639-647PubMed Google Scholar). We had hoped to examine murine A1AR promoter expression in murine cell lines that express endogenous A1ARs. However, we are unaware of murine cell lines expressing A1ARs at levels detectable by radioligand binding studies. Fortunately, although DDT1 MF-2 cell lines are not of murine origin, mA1ARp expression was readily apparent in these cells. Studies of murine A1AR promoter truncation mutants showed that the reporter constructs spanning the region from −502 to +35 had the highest levels of activity. In contrast, when the distal regions of the mA1ARp were present in reporter constructs, receptor expression was greatly reduced, raising the possibility that this region contains binding domains for repression elements. Sequence analysis of the −502 to +35 fragment suggested the presence of GATA and Nkx2.5 binding sites; no other GATA or Nkx binding motifs were found within this region. Mutation of the GATA or Nkx2.5 motifs resulted in reduction in promoter expression, suggesting that these sites play important roles in endogenous A1AR gene expression. When co-transfection studies were performed using GATA-4 and Nkx2.5 expression vectors, increased promoter activity was observed, supporting the notion that GATA-4 and Nkx2.5 can activate A1AR gene expression. When cells were transfected with both GATA-4 and Nkx2.5, synergistic effects on mA1ARp activity were observed. In mice, GATA-4 and Nkx2.5 are expressed in the heart as early as postconceptual day 6.5 and play a role in driving cardiac gene expression (31Heikinheimo M. Scandrett J.M. Wilson D.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 32Grepin C. Robitaille L. Antakly T. Nemer M. Mol. Cell.

Recently, Nkx2.5 and GATA-4 have been shown to directly interact to drive the expression of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) promoter (27Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 28Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), as we observed for the murine A1AR promoter. Both ANF and A1ARs are expressed in the heart at early developmental stages (27Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 28Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), although cardiac A1AR expression occurs at even earlier ages than ANF cardiac expression (6Rivkees S.A. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 89: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It is thus tempting to speculate that GATA-4 and Nkx2.5 play a role in the early cardiac expression of A1ARs and ANF. Interestingly, Nkx2.5 is also expressed in the tongue during early gestation (33Lints T.J. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Lyons I. Harvey R.P. Development. 1993; 119: 969PubMed Google Scholar); we also observed A1AR gene expression in the tongue at the same developmental stages (6Rivkees S.A. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 89: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Whereas GATA-4 and Nkx2.5 may play a role in cardiac A1AR expression, these factors are not expressed in the central nervous system (31Heikinheimo M. Scandrett J.M. Wilson D.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 32Grepin C. Robitaille L. Antakly T. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4095-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 33Lints T.J. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Lyons I. Harvey R.P. Development. 1993; 119: 969PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, other transcriptional activating factors will play a role in A1AR expression in the brain. Currently, the identity of these factors is unknown. Overall, we now show that the proximal promoter of the murine A1AR contains critical elements for A1AR gene expression in the brain and heart. Murine A1AR promoter activity also appears to be potently regulated by the transcriptional activating factors GATA-4 and Nkx2.5, which interact at a specific site in the proximal A1AR promoter. Future studies are indicated to identify additional promoter regions and transcriptional regulators that influence A1AR expression in other important sites of adenosine action. Dr. Jean Lachowicz is thanked for assistance in some of these studies. Dr. Robert J. Schwartz is thanked for providing GATA-4 and Nkx2.5 expression constructs. Dr. Patrick Gallagher is thanked for technical suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W1976626158,"Agouti-related protein (AGRP) is an endogenous antagonist of melanocortin action that functions in the hypothalamic control of feeding behavior. Although previous studies have shown that AGRP binds three of the five known subtypes of melanocortin receptor, the receptor domains participating in binding and the molecular interactions involved are presently unknown. The present studies were designed to examine the contribution of extracytoplasmic domains of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) to AGRP binding by making chimerical receptor constructs of the human melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R; a receptor that is not inhibited by AGRP) and the human MC4R (a receptor that is potently inhibited by AGRP). Substitutions of the extracytoplasmic NH2 terminus and the first extracytoplasmic loop (exoloop) of the MC4R with homologous domains of the MC1R had no effect on AGRP (87–132) binding affinity or inhibitory activity (the ability to inhibit melanocortin-stimulated cAMP generation). In contrast, cassette substitutions of exoloops 2 and 3 of the MC4R with the homologous exoloops of the MC1R resulted in a substantial loss of AGRP binding affinity and inhibitory activity. Conversely, the exchange of exoloops 2 and 3 of the MC1R with the homologous exoloops of the MC4R was found to confer AGRP binding and inhibitory activity to the basic structure of the MC1R. Importantly, these substitutions did not affect the ability of the α-melanocyte stimulating hormone analogue [Nle4,d-Phe7] melanocyte stimulating hormone to bind or activate the chimeric receptors. These data indicate that exoloops 2 and 3 of the melanocortin receptors are important for AGRP binding.

These peptides have been implicated in diverse physiological processes but are most widely recognized for their roles in melanogenesis, steroidogenesis, and, more recently, feeding behavior (1Tatro J.B.

In addition, two endogenous melanocortin antagonists, Agouti and AGRP, have been discovered that function as modifiers of melanocortin action. The most well-documented function of Agouti is its action as a paracrine signaling molecule that modifies melanocortin action at the MC1R (the melanocyte MCR) (10Bultman S.J. Michaud E.J.

Agouti is temporally produced by cells adjacent to the hair follicle melanocyte and is responsible for the Agouti phenotype (dark hair with a sub-apical yellow band).In vitro studies have demonstrated that recombinant Agouti is a potent antagonist of melanocortin action at MCR subtypes 1, 2, and 4 (11Lu D.

Yamada T. Gantz I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). AGRP was originally identified from its sequence similarity to Agouti (14Shutter J.R. Graham M. Kinsey A.C. Scully S. Lthy R. Stark K.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 15Fong T.M. Mao C. MacNeil T. Kalyani R. Smith T. Weinberg D. Tota M.R.

Science. 1997; 278: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar). Both AGRP and Agouti have a COOH-terminal cysteine-rich motif. In contrast to Agouti, AGRP is a potent antagonist of the melanocortin-3 receptor and the MC4R and has also been shown to have a lesser degree of inhibitory action at the melanocortin-5 receptor. Although a full understanding of the biological spectrum of AGRP action remains to be determined, its expression in the hypothalamus, its ability to inhibit the action of α-MSH at the MC4R, and its ability as a transgene (under the control of a β-actin promoter) to cause obesity in mice indicate that it is involved in the regulation of feeding behavior. In the hypothalamus, α-MSH is believed to act a satiety-inducing factor that mediates its action through the MC4R, whereas AGRP is one of several opposing orexigenic agents. AGRP is transcribed as 132 amino acids in man (131 amino acids in mouse), and although it is not presently known whether it is post-translationally processed in mammals, we have recently shown that a 46-amino acid COOH-terminal AGRP variant has the same ability to selectively bind MCR subtypes and functionally inhibit melanocortins as the full-length molecule (17Yang Y.-K. Thompson D. Dickinson C.J. Wilken J. Barsh G.S. Kent S.B.H. Gantz I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Pharmacological studies using this chemically synthesized truncated AGRP variant, AGRP (87–132), indicate that AGRP is a competitive antagonist of α-MSH at MCR subtypes 3, 4, and 5. AGRP has very little amino acid sequence similarity to melanocortins. Even in its artificially truncated form, AGRP is 46 amino acids and contains 10 cysteine residues capable of forming five disulfide bonds. In contrast, the predominant melanocortin in the hypothalamus, α-MSH, is only 13 amino acids in length and has no cysteine residues. These observations suggest that the members of this agonist-antagonist pair have significantly different tertiary structures, despite their use of the same receptors. It is also important to note that with respect to their competitive interaction, α-MSH is capable of activating MCR subtypes 1, 3, 4, and 5, whereas AGRP can only inhibit the action of α-MSH action at MCR subtypes 3, 4, and 5. In view of their apparent structural dissimilarity and subtype specificity, it is likely that α-MSH and AGRP have receptor binding determinants that are not identical. To date, little is known about the molecular forces and receptor domains involved in AGRP-MCR binding. Based on assumptions about its structure and presently held concepts about the way larger peptides bind seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors, we hypothesized that one potential binding determinant for AGRP might be the extracytoplasmic domains of the MCRs. The amino acid sequences of the MC1R and MC4R were examined by a hydrophobicity plot (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI) and examined manually by comparing their sequences to a previously published alignment of seven transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor α-helices (18Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). The chimeras utilized in these studies are schematically diagrammed in Fig.1. The chimeras were constructed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The human MC1R and MC4R served as a template. During an initial round of PCR, partial-length receptor fragments were generated. The sequence of one of the PCR primer oligonucleotides consisted of an extracytoplasmic domain of interest coupled to a portion of the transmembrane domain required to form a chimeric receptor. The second oligonucleotide primer consisted of either the 5′ or 3′ end of the MC1R or MC4R. Receptor fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and used in a second round of PCR in which full-length chimeric receptor constructs were assembled by cycling the appropriate fragments together for 10 cycles before adding both 5′ and 3′ receptor primers. The chimeric receptors were subcloned into the M13 vector for single-stranded dideoxynucleotide sequencing to check that the desired sequences were present and that no sequence errors had been introduced by PCR. The constructs were then subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A comparison of the exchanged amino acid sequences of the NH2-terminal, first, second, and third exoloops of the MC1R and MC4R is shown in Fig. 2. The sequence of the wild-type MC4R used in these studies can be found in GenBankTM under accession number L08603 (8Gantz I. Miwa H. Konda Y. Shimoto Y. Tashiro T. Watson S.J. DelValle J. Yamada T. J.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), with some modification. Briefly, 12 h before the experiments, 0.2 million cells were plated on 24-well plates. Before initiating the binding experiments, cells were washed twice with minimum Eagle's medium. Cells were then incubated with different concentrations of unlabeled ligand containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and either 1 × 105 cpm of 125I-NDP-MSH or 1 × 105 cpm of 125I-AGRP. After a 1-h incubation, the cells were again washed twice with minimum Eagle's medium, and the experiment was terminated by lysing the cells with 0.1 nNaOH and 1% Triton X-100. Radioactivity present in the lysate was quantified using an analytical gamma counter. Nonspecific binding was determined by measuring the amount of 125I label remaining bound in the presence of 10−5m unlabeled ligand, and specific binding was obtained by subtracting the nonspecific bound radioactivity from the total bound radioactivity. The binding displacement curves were drawn using Graphpad Prism. The agonist-antagonist complex dissociation constant was calculated using the equation K b = [AGRP]/(EC50ratio − 1). All experiments represent n ≥ 3 ± S.E. Fig. 2 A demonstrates that cassette substitutions of the NH2 terminus, first, second, and third exoloop of the MC4R (alone or in combination) with homologous regions of the MC1R did not alter 125I-NDP-MSH binding. Data in Figs. 2 and 4 are expressed as total counts per minute (cpm) to emphasize the point that the various HEK-293 cell lines expressed roughly the same numbers of receptors. Fig. 2 B summarizes the ability of AGRP (87–132) to displace125I-NDP-MSH from the MC4R/MC1R chimeras. IC50values are listed in Table I. As shown, AGRP (87–132) had only a minute ability to displace125I-NDP-MSH binding from the wild-type MC1R. In contrast, AGRP (87–132) dose-dependently displaced all125I-NDP-MSH from the MC4R. These data are consistent with the known MCR subtype specificity of AGRP. Substitution of the NH2 terminus or the first exoloop of the MC4R with homologous loops of the MC1R had no effect on the ability of AGRP (87–132) to displace 125I-NDP-MSH. However, substitution of the second or third exoloop of the MC4R with those of the MC1R resulted in a significantly reduced IC50 of AGRP (87–132) in inhibiting 125I-NDP-MSH binding to chimeric receptor MC4R/2eMC1R or MC4R/3eMC1R. Simultaneous substitution of the second and third exoloops of the MC4R with those of the MC1R (chimera MC4R/2e, 3eMC1R) led to further inhibition of AGRP binding.Table IEffect of NDP-MSH and AGRP on 125I NDP-MSH binding on HEK cells transfected with chimeras of human MC4RChimerasBinding IC50(nm)NDP-MSHAGRPMC4RWT3.48 ± 0.269.1 ± 1.2MC4R/NH2MC1R2.78 ± 0.149 ± 0.5MC4R/1eMC1R3.25 ± 0.149.4 ± 2.8MC4R/2eMC1R4.1 ± 0.2263 ± 5.9MC4R/3eMC1R3.1 ± 0.16126 ± 5.2MC4R/2e,3eMC1R3.27 ± 0.65562 ± 26MC1RWT0.42 ± 0.02>1000 Open table in a new tab To further examine AGRP binding to the chimerical receptors, binding studies were performed with 125I-AGRP (87–132) (Fig.2 C). As expected, the wild-type MC1R demonstrated little if any specific 125I-AGRP (87–132) binding. In contrast, significant 125I-AGRP (87–132) binding was observed at the MC4R. Notably, there was a progressive loss in specific125I-AGRP (87–132) binding at chimeric MC4R with substitutions of the second and third exoloop with homologous exoloops of the MC1R (chimeras MC4R/2eMC1R, MC4R/3eMC1R, and MC4R/2e,3eMC1R). Substitution of the third exoloop had a greater effect than substitution of the second loop, and simultaneous substitution of exoloops 2 and 3 had an additive effect. These data are entirely consistent with the ability of AGRP to displace125I-NDP-MSH binding presented in Fig. 2 B. The chimerical MC4R containing both exoloops 2 and 3 of the MC1R (MC4R/2e, 3eMC1R) retained only approximately 38% of the specific125I-AGRP (87–132) binding of the wild-type MC4R. To study the functional effects of exoloop substitution in more detail, the ability of AGRP (87–132) to inhibit melanocortin action at the MC4R/MC1R chimeras was examined in cAMP assays (Fig.3). Consistent with the known effects of AGRP, 3 × 10−7m AGRP (87–132) potently inhibited NDP-MSH action at the MC4R (Fig. 3 A) but had no effect on NDP-MSH-stimulated cAMP generation at the MC1R (Fig.3 E). Fig. 3, B and C, reveals that there was a loss in the ability of AGRP to inhibit NDP-MSH-stimulated cAMP generation at the chimeric MC4R/MC1R containing the second or third exoloops of the MC1R. When compared with the wild-type MC4R, simultaneous substitution of exoloops 2 and 3 of the MC4R with those of the MC1R resulted in a greater loss in the ability of AGRP (87–132) to inhibit NDP-MSH-stimulated cAMP than substitution of either individual exoloop (Fig. 3 D).

We hypothesized that if exoloops 2 and 3 were important to AGRP binding, then cassette substitution of those MC1R exoloops with those homologous exoloops of the MC4R would result in a chimeric MC1R that, unlike the wild-type MC1R, would be able to interact with AGRP. Fig. 4 Ademonstrates that MC1R chimeras with substitutions of their second and third exoloops of the MC4R retained a 125I-NDP-MSH binding affinity comparable to that of the wild-type MC1R. Fig. 4 B shows that AGRP (87–132) had only a minimal ability to displace 125I-NDP-MSH binding at the wild-type MC1R. A small displacement of 125I-NDP-MSH binding was observed only at very high concentrations of AGRP (87–132). In contrast, AGRP (87–132) dose-dependently displaced all bound125I-NDP-MSH from the MC4R. Remarkably, substitution of the second or third exoloop of the MC4R into the sequence of the MC1R caused a dramatic increase in the ability of AGRP (87–132) to displace125I-NDP-MSH from the basic structure of the MC1R, whose nonmutated form lacks responsiveness to AGRP. A stepwise increase in the ability of AGRP ability to displace 125I-NDP-MSH binding from chimeras MC1R/2eMC4R, MC1R/3eMC4R, and MC1R/2e,3eMC4R was observed. Simultaneous substitution of both the second and third exoloops of MC4R had an additive effect on this parameter. Notably, substitution of MC4R exoloop 3 had a greater effect on the ability of AGRP (87–132) to displace 125I-NDP-MSH binding than did MC4R exoloop 2. The IC50 values are reported in TableIII.Table IIIEffect of NDP-MSH and AGRP on 125I NDP-MSH binding on cells transfected with chimeras of the human MC1RChimerasBinding IC50NDP-MSHAGRPnMMC1RWT0.38 ± 0.05>1000MC1R/2eMC4R0.5 ± 0.12316 ± 26.5MC1R/3eMC4R0.76 ± 0.21100 ± 21MC1R/2e,3eMC4R0.71 ± 0.1432 ± 7.6MC4RWT3.81 ± 0.329 ± 1.2 Open table in a new tab Fig. 4 C shows that individual or simultaneous substitutions of the second and third exoloops of the MC4R into the sequence of the MC1R (chimeras MC1R/2eMC4R, MC1R/3eMC4R, and MC1R/2e,3eMC4R) conferred upon the MC1R a dramatically increased ability to bind125I-AGRP (87–132). These data are consistent with the ability of AGRP to displace 125I-NDP-MSH binding presented in Fig. 4 B. As shown, substitution of the third exoloop had a greater effect than substitution of the second loop, and simultaneous substitution of MC4R exoloops 2 and 3 had an additive effect. The chimerical MC1R containing both exoloops 2 and 3 of the MC4R (MC1R/2e,3eMC4R) demonstrated approximately 76% of the specific125I-AGRP (87–132) binding of the wild-type MC4R. As in the case of the MC4R/MC1R chimeras, we sought to more fully examine the functional effects of exoloop substitutions by examining the ability of AGRP (87–132) to inhibit melanocortin-stimulated cAMP generation. Fig.5 A demonstrates that 3 × 10−7m AGRP (87–132) had no ability to inhibit melanocortin-stimulated cAMP generation at the wild-type MC1R. In contrast, AGRP (87–132) is a potent antagonist of NDP-MSH action at the wild-type MC4R (Fig. 5 E). As shown in Fig. 5,B and C, placement of MC4R exoloop 2 or exoloop 3 into the sequence of the MC1R led to a chimerical receptor that, unlike the wild-type MC1R, was inhibited by AGRP. Substitution of the third exoloop of the MC1R with the third exoloop of the MC4R had a greater effect on establishing functional AGRP inhibition than did substitution of the second exoloop of the MC4R. Simultaneous substitution of exoloops 2 and 3 of the MC1R with the homologous exoloops of the MC4R led to a chimerical MC1R that could be significantly inhibited by AGRP (Fig. 5 D). The cAMP data of the MC1R/MC4R chimeras are completely consistent with radioligand binding studies from the same chimeric receptors (Fig. 4). EC50 and K bvalues are reported in Table IV.Table IVEffect of AGRP on cAMP formation stimulated by NDP-MSH on HEK cells transfected with chimeras of the human MC1RNDP-MSHNDP-MSH + AGRP (10−7m)NDP-MSH + AGRPAGRPK bNDP-MSHEC50nmEC50 nmnmMC1RWT0.31 ± 0.040.36 ± 0.61.16276.8 ± 32MC1R/2eMC4R0.18 ± 0.030.59 ± 0.113.3130 ± 13MC1R/3eMC4R0.14 ± 0.051.2 ± 0.218.639.47 ± 6.8MC1R/2e,3eMC4R0.35 ± 0.0638.4 ± 6.2109.72.75 ± 0.87MC4RWT0.92 ± 0.12228.8 ± 34247.8.11.2 ± 0.05 Open table in a new tab Recent insights into the hypothalamic control of feeding behavior indicate that α-MSH, which is produced by neurons in the arcuate nucleus, purveys a satiety signal that is mediated through the MC4R (the role of the melanocortin-3 receptor within the arcuate nucleus has not yet been clearly defined). Produced by adjacent neuropeptide Y-containing neurons, AGRP is believed to act as an opposing orexigenic agent. In its role as an important mediator of satiety, the MC4R has become a prime target for anti-obesity drug development. An understanding of the molecular basis underlying the ability of α-MSH and AGRP to bind the MC4R is of potential importance to those pharmaceutical discovery efforts. Previous three-dimensional modeling of the MC1R, extensive point mutagenesis of the human MCR subtypes 1, 3, and 4, and structure-activity studies using substituted and truncated adrenocorticotropic hormone 1–13 fragments have led us to formulate a structural model of MCR in which agonists bind to the MCRs in a relatively shallow pocket formed by the transmembrane α-helices of those receptors (19Haskell-Luevano C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23000-23010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In general, this model of melanocortin binding to the MCRs is consistent with current concepts regarding the molecular interactions of small peptide hormones and seven transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors (21Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). A model for AGRP binding to the MCRs remains to be developed. Our previous characterization of AGRP (87–132) described a molecule that consisted only of the COOH-terminal cysteine motif of AGRP (17Yang Y.-K. Thompson D. Dickinson C.J. Wilken J. Barsh G.S. Kent S.B.H. Gantz I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although this molecule contained no NH2-terminal amino acids proximal to the first cysteine residue present in the AGRP sequence (Cys-87), it retained full biological activity. Whereas it is plausible to assume that the deletion of cysteine residues would disrupt the AGRP tertiary structure by removing disulfide bonds and would result in a molecule with markedly diminished functional capabilities, those experiments did not test this point, and it cannot definitely be said that AGRP (87–132) is a truly “minimized” AGRP molecule. Based on the probable size of AGRP, we hypothesized that AGRP was likely to bind to receptor domains other than or in addition to transmembrane domains. Extracytoplasmic receptor domains constitute a logical site that could be involved in AGRP binding. Seven transmembrane receptors have four potential extracytoplasmic domains including the NH2 terminus, first, second, and third extracytoplasmic loops (exoloops) at which binding might occur. Importantly, the NH2 terminus of the MCRs is not long, unlike the glycoprotein, metabotropic glutamate, and ion-sensing receptors in which lengthy NH2 termini have been found to play a crucial role in ligand binding. In the present experiments, we demonstrate that exoloops 2 and 3 of the MC4R are crucial determinants of AGRP binding affinity and inhibitory activity. Substitution of MC4R exoloops 2 and 3 with those homologous exoloops of the MC1R resulted in a loss of AGRP binding affinity and inhibitory activity, whereas placement of those MC4R exoloops into the sequence of the MC1R led to the establishment of significant AGRP activity at the MC1R. A comparison of the relative degree of change in AGRP binding affinity and inhibitory activity displayed by the MCR chimeras indicates that substitution of exoloop 3 induced more profound effects than substitutions of exoloop 2. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the amino acid sequence of exoloop 3 of the MC1R and MC4R is longer than that of exoloop 2 and that exoloop 3 has a greater degree of dissimilarity in amino acid side chain charge and hydrophobicity than exoloop 2 (Fig. 1). Importantly, the observation that similar receptor numbers were expressed suggests that receptor expression is not the basis of the observed changes in cAMP assays. Whereas the present studies have clearly identified receptor domains (exoloops 2 and 3) that are involved in antagonist binding, they do not conclusively reveal the mechanism underlying those changes. Inherent to most mutagenesis studies is the inability to unequivocally discern whether pharmacological effects result from a direct disruption of atomic interactions involving the ligand and receptor or whether they result from conformational changes imposed on the receptor that only indirectly affect ligand binding. In other words, it is difficult to state with absolute certainty that the changes in AGRP binding affinity and inhibitory activity observed in these studies truly resulted from the addition or removal of specific amino acids (present in the exoloops) that have direct atomic interactions with the amino acids of AGRP. Instead, it is possible that the observed pharmacological changes simply resulted from an alteration in chimeric receptor structure unrelated to the pharmacophore binding pocket that permitted or discouraged AGRP binding, despite being uncharacteristic of the wild-type receptor on which they were based. Several observations favor an interpretation that specific sites of interaction were identified in these studies. First, all chimeras retained a 125I-NDP-MSH binding affinity similar to that observed at the wild-type MCRs, and all chimeras were activated by nanomolar concentrations of NDP-MSH. If the tertiary structure of the chimeric receptors had been drastically altered, one would expect that the ability of NDP-MSH to bind and activate the chimeric receptors should have been altered. Second, exchange of exoloops between the MC1R and MC4R led not only to a loss of the ability of AGRP to bind chimeric MCRs and inhibit NDP-MSH action (MC4R/MC1R chimeras) but also to a gain in the functional ability of AGRP to bind chimeric MCRs and inhibit NDP-MSH action (MC1R/MC4R chimeras). Despite these salient points, the possibility that small, localized conformational changes in the chimeric receptors are responsible for the observed pharmacological effects lingers. However, regardless of the distinction between direct and indirect causation, it is still possible to conclude that the present studies have identified an important intrinsic property of the MCRs residing in exoloops 2 and 3 that facilitates AGRP binding. The present studies should not be interpreted to mean that the only receptor domains involved in AGRP binding are exoloops 2 and 3. In fact, the observation that exoloops 2 and 3 of the MC4R were not sufficient to confer full AGRP binding affinity and inhibitory activity to the MC1R (chimera MC1R/2e,3eMC4R) could be viewed as evidence that other MCR domains also participate in AGRP binding. Similarly, removal of exoloops 2 and 3 from the MC4R (MC4R/2e,3eMC1R) was not sufficient to lead to a complete loss of AGRP (87–132) binding affinity and inhibitory activity. The studies reported herein primarily address the binding of AGRP to the MCRs. Nonetheless, some additional comment and a specific word of caution are warranted regarding the implications of these studies to NDP-MSH binding. Existing literature is conflicting regarding the contribution of exoloops to the binding of melanocortin agonists to the MCRs. Chhajlani et al. (22Chhajlani V. Xu X. Blauw J. Sudarshi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) reported that mutating several hydrophilic residues in the NH2 terminus and exoloops 1, 2, and 3 of the MC1R resulted in significant shifts in125I-NDP-MSH binding. In contrast, Schiöth et al. (23Schiöth H.B. Muceniece R. Szardening M. Prussi P. Wikberg J.E.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) performed mutagenesis studies on exoloop 2 of the human melanocortin-3 receptor and concluded that this exoloop was not involved in NDP-MSH binding. At the time of publication, neither of these groups had the advantage of using radioligand125I-AGRP (87–132), which is of a distinctly different nature from 125I-NDP-MSH, to check the structural integrity of their mutated receptors. Unfortunately, the present studies are not capable of resolving the controversy over whether exoloops are significantly involved in NDP-MSH binding. The fact that changing exoloops did not alter NDP-MSH binding affinity or potency could support the notion that exoloops are not critical to its binding. On the other hand, because both the MC1R and MC4R bind NDP-MSH, any binding determinants in exoloops 2 and 3 could simply have been switched in the construction of the chimeras. These data also make it tempting to hypothesize that a component of the subtype specificity of the MCRs for Agouti resides in the second and third receptor exoloops. It is not unreasonable to speculate that the relative affinity of Agouti for selected MCR subtypes could be increased or decreased by altering exoloops 2 and 3. Cassette mutagenesis experiments could be used to address this question (e.g. by exchanging the second and third exoloops between the melanocortin-3 receptor or the melanocortin-5 receptor and the MC1R and observing the increases or decreases in the affinity or inhibitory activity of Agouti). In summary, the present data have identified an important MCR structural property involved in AGRP binding that resides in exoloops 2 and 3. Whereas these exoloops appear to have a preeminent effect on AGRP binding, it will be important in the future to determine whether other MCR domains are also involved in AGRP binding and to define the relative importance of those domains compared with these exoloops.

The vitamin D receptor is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates the biological effects of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25-(OH)2D3). 1The abbreviations used are: 1, 25-(OH)2D3, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; VDR, vitamin D receptor; AF-2, activation function 2; LBD, ligand-binding domain; RXR, retinoid X receptor; SRC-1, steroid receptor coactivator 1; GRIP-1, glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; VDRE, vitamin D response element; AF-1 activation function 1, AF-2a, activation function 2a; TR, thyroid hormone receptor; GH, growth hormone The mechanism involves a 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced heterodimerization of VDR with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), VDR-RXR binding to vitamin D-responsive elements (VDREs) in the promoter regions of specific genes, and the subsequent impact of the VDR-RXR heterodimer on transcriptional control of vitamin D responsive genes (1, 2). Discrete domains of the VDR that are important to this mechanism are the 90-residue zinc finger DNA-binding module in the NH2-terminal portion of the VDR, the large COOH-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD), an RXR heterodimerization interface located within the COOH-terminal portion of the LBD, and the activation function 2 (AF-2) domain. The AF-2 domain is a small α-helical region located at the extreme COOH terminus of the VDR. The precise role of the AF-2 domain in VDR-activated transcription is not fully understood. Recent studies show that it plays a central role in mediating ligand-dependent protein-protein interactions with the p160 family of nuclear receptor coactivator proteins such as SRC-1 and GRIP-1 (3Henttu P.M.

In the unliganded RXR, helix H12 (which contains the AF-2 motif) projects out from the globular LBD core (13Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). In the liganded receptor (e.g., the estrogen receptor, the retinoic acid receptor, or the thyroid hormone receptor), the AF-2 helix is folded down onto the surface of the LBD where it is thought to close off the hydrophobic ligand binding pocket (14Brzozowski A.

Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Interestingly, p160 coactivator proteins do not interact appreciably with unliganded receptors in which the AF-2 domain may, in fact, be more surface exposed (8Hong H. Kohli K. Trivedi A.

Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar). High affinity coactivator interaction with nuclear receptors apparently requires a ligand-induced repositioning of the AF-2 helix against the core of the LBD. This suggests that the AF-2 helix alone is required but is not completely sufficient to mediate coactivator interaction and that an interaction surface comprised of the AF-2 domain and other surface-exposed domains is needed for efficient coactivator interaction and transactivation. Candidate domains surrounding the AF-2 core that may form a part of a coactivator interaction surface include exposed residues on the surfaces of helices H3 and H4, the loop between H11 and H12, and the region between H1 and H3 comprising the Ω loop (13Bourguet W.

Recently, we identified a novel autonomous activation function in helix H3 of the VDR that is distinct from the AF-2 activation domain. 2Kraichely, D. M., Nakai, Y. D., and MacDonald, P. N., (1999) J. Cell. Biochem., in press. Here, we show that select residues within the helix H3 activation domain are also required for ligand-dependent transcription and interaction of VDR with the p160 family of nuclear receptor coactivators including SRC-1 and GRIP-1. Specifically, a Y236A helix H3 mutation in the VDR selectively disrupted 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced interactions between VDR and SRC-1 or GRIP-1. These data support a model for VDR in which ligand binding creates a transactivation surface or platform for the binding of p160 coactivator proteins. Important components of this transactivation platform for the VDR are helices H3 and H12. Single-stranded DNA for the mammalian expression vector pSG5-VDR (4–427) was isolated as described.2 Mutations were introduced using the GeneEditorin vitro oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The reporter constructs, (VDRE)4-TATA-GH and (GAL4)5-TATA-GH were described previously (6Masuyama H. Brownfield C.M. St-Arnaud R. MacDonald P.N. Mol.

The expression plasmids for pSG5 GAL4-VDR-(195–238) wild-type and helix H3 point mutants were described.2 The pSG5-VDR-(4–427) expression plasmid was described previously (20Hsieh J.C. Jurutka P.W.

The pSG5 full-length GRIP-1 expression plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Michael R. Stallcup and has been described previously (22Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected by standard calcium phosphate precipitation procedures as described previously (21MacDonald P.N. Dowd D.R. Nakajima S. Galligan M.A. Reeder M.C. Haussler C.A. Ozato K.

In all transfections, the amount of total DNA was kept constant at 15 μg by adding pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as a carrier plasmid. Transfected cells were treated with 10−8m 1,25-(OH)2D3 or ethanol vehicle for 24 h, and an immunoassay was used to determine the amount of secreted GH (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA). GST-VDR wild-type and helix H3 point mutants (H229A, D232A, and Y236A) were expressed in the DH5α strain of Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity as described previously (23Baudino T.A.

Purified proteins (0.5 μg) were each combined with 4.5 μg of nuclear extracts of HeLa cells and incubated with four different concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2-[3H]D3 (18 Ci/mmol) overnight at 4 °C in the presence or absence of a 400-fold molar excess of unlabeled 1,25-(OH)2D3. Nuclear extracts were added because previous studies have shown that highly purified VDR obtained from bacterial and baculovirus expression systems requires additional nuclear proteins to facilitate high-affinity ligand binding (25Nakajima S. Hsieh J.C. MacDonald P.N. Haussler C.A. Galligan M.A. Jurutka P.W. Haussler M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). GST alone or HeLa cell extracts alone generally showed less than 1% specific binding in this assay. Unbound ligand was removed with dextran-coated charcoal, and specific binding in the bound fraction was determined by scintillation counting. Binding curves were analyzed by Scatchard plots to determine the dissociation constant. All two-hybrid plasmid constructs used the pAS1 (26Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y.

The pAS1-VDR-(116–427) wild-type and Y236A mutant each contained the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–147) and the carboxyl-terminal region of VDR (amino acids 116–427). The pAD-mSRC-1-(1169–1465), pAD-mRIP-140-(867–1158), pAD-GAL4-RXRα-(235–493), and pAD-GAL4 were identical to those formerly described by our lab (6Masuyama H. Brownfield C.M. St-Arnaud R.

Interactions between the purified GST fusion proteins and [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were assessed as described (23Baudino T.A. Kraichely D.M. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. Winchester S.K. Partridge N.C.

Autoradiographic images were scanned and densitometrically quantitated using ImageQuant, Version 3.0, software from Molecular Dynamics. We have identified a distinct transactivation function within helix H3 of the human vitamin D receptor that resides between residues Asp195 and Ile238.2 Fusion of this helix H3 domain to a heterologous DNA-binding domain such as GAL4-(1–147) was sufficient to mediate potent transactivation of a GAL4-responsive reporter gene construct (Fig. 1). Moreover, expression of this minimal domain (Asp195-Ile238 of the VDR) interfered with 1,25-(OH)2D3-stimulated transcription by intact VDR, indicating a central role for this minimal domain in VDR-mediated transactivation.2 Three important residues within the minimal domain were identified as His229, Asp232, and Tyr236. Altering these amino acids individually to alanine residues reduced (H229A or Y236A) or abolished (D232A) this autonomous transactivation activity (Fig. 1). To investigate the functional importance of amino acid residues within helix H3 for 1,25-(OH)2D3-activated transcription by full-length VDR, point mutations were introduced into the full-length pSG5-VDR-(4–427) plasmid, and the ability of these mutants (S225A, H229A, D232A, S235A, Y236A, and K240A) to activate transcription of a (VDRE)4-TATA-GH reporter gene in COS-7 cells was examined. As illustrated in Fig.2, the S225A and K240A mutations showed only modest effects (20–30% decrease compared with wild-type VDR), whereas the mutation of Ser235 led to a greater than 55% reduction in the ligand-dependent transcription of a vitamin D-responsive reporter. However, most striking were the mutations of His229, Asp232, and Tyr236 which individually eliminated VDR-activated transcription. As shown in the lower panel of Fig. 2, Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates from duplicate transfection plates revealed nearly equivalent expression of VDR for the mutants examined in this assay, with the exception being the D232A mutant which showed somewhat reduced levels of expression or stability. Consequently, His229, Asp232, and Tyr236 are three residues within helix H3 that are determined to be important for both the autonomous activity of the minimal domain (Fig. 1) and for ligand-activated transcription of full-length VDR (Fig. Figure 1, Figure 2).Figure 2Point mutations within helix H3 in the full-length VDR disrupt ligand-activated transcription. A series of point mutations were generated within helix H3 in the full-length pSG5-VDR-(4–427) by site-directed mutagenesis, and these mutants were tested in COS-7 cells. Each transfection included 3 μg of a (VDRE)4-TATA-GH reporter construct and either 10 ng of pSG5-VDR-(4–427) wild-type or a mutant version (S225A, H229A, D232A, S235A, Y236A, or K240A). The cells were treated in the absence or presence of 10−8m1,25-(OH)2D3 as indicated for 24 h, and GH secretion was determined by an immunoassay. A western immunoblot analysis of pSG5-VDR-(4–427) wild-type and mutants using the anti-VDR-9A7 antibody is shown in the bottom panel. Extracts were prepared from duplicate plates of COS-7 cells transfected with the wild-type pSG5-VDR-(4–427) and the helix H3 mutants (S225A, H229A, D232A, S235A, Y236A, and K240A) in pSG5-VDR-(4–427).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the precise molecular basis for the loss of ligand-dependent transactivation in these mutant VDRs, a number of important functional parameters were analyzed including RXR heterodimerization, ligand-binding, and coactivator interaction. To determine whether these mutations altered VDR heterodimerization with RXR, in vitro protein-protein interaction assays were performed (Fig. 3 A), and a quantitation of these interactions is presented in Fig. 3 B. A 5-fold increase in the amount of 35S-labeled VDR (wild-type) binding to GST-RXR was observed in the presence of 10−8m 1,25-(OH)2D3(compare lanes 3–4). Similarly, 35S-labeled full-length VDR mutants (S225A, S235A, Y236A, and K240A) showed ligand-dependent interaction with RXR that was comparable with wild-type (lanes 7–8, 19–20,23–24, and 27–28). However,35S-labeled full-length VDR mutants H229A and D232A were impaired in their ability to interact with RXR in a ligand-dependent manner (lanes 11–12 and15–16). Neither wild-type nor any mutant showed interaction with GST alone (lanes 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and26). These data suggest that the H229A and D232A mutations in full-length VDR compromised the ability of the receptor to bind ligand or to heterodimerize with RXR. Several helix H3 VDR mutants were then examined in an in vitro ligand-binding assay. Specific, saturable binding curves were generated for the binding of 1,25-(OH)2-[3H]D3 by purified wild-type VDR and mutants. As suggested from the previous experiment, the VDR mutants H229A and D232A exhibited impaired abilities to bind the 1,25-(OH)2D3 ligand (Fig.4). The Y236A mutation appeared to bind ligand with an affinity comparable with wild-type VDR. Dissociation constants for the binding of 1,25-(OH)2-[3H]D3 by the wild-type VDR and mutants were determined from Scatchard plots of the saturable binding curves (Fig. 4, inset). The Y236A mutant had a KD similar to wild-type VDR (0.2–0.3 nm), whereas the H229A and D232A mutants had 4.5- and 8-fold lower affinities, respectively. Cumulatively, these data indicate that the H229A and D232A mutations were inactive in hormone-mediated VDR transcription, presumably because of impaired ligand binding and subsequent inability to heterodimerize with RXR. In contrast, the loss of 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated transactivation by the Y236A mutation could not be explained by this defect because it bound ligand with an affinity similar to that of wild-type VDR, and it interacted in a ligand-dependent manner with RXR. These data suggested that the Y236A mutant must be defective in some other aspect of receptor action that did not include hormone binding or RXR heterodimerization. Therefore, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to assess the ability of wild-type VDR and mutant Y236A to interact with nuclear receptor coactivator proteins (Fig. 5). In this system, ligand-dependent interactions were observed between the wild-type VDR (pAS1-VDR-(116–427)) and fusion proteins of SRC-1 and RIP-140 (pAD-mSRC-1-(1169–1465) and pAD-mRIP-140-(867–1158), respectively). These 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependent interactions between wild-type VDR and SRC-1 or RIP-140 were observed previously (6Masuyama H. Brownfield C.M. St-Arnaud R. MacDonald P.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the helix H3 point mutant Y236A (pAS1-VDR-(116–427) Y236A) showed markedly reduced interaction with RIP-140 and essentially no interaction with SRC-1. Both wild-type and mutant Y236A retained strong interaction with RXRα in this system (data not shown). No interaction was observed with the AD-GAL4 parent plasmid for either wild-type VDR or mutant Y236A. Thus, 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependent interactions between VDR (Y236A) and AF-2 coactivator proteins were dramatically impaired compared with wild-type VDR as determined by the yeast two-hybrid system. To confirm these in vivo yeast two-hybrid data, interactions between VDR (Y236A) and p160 coactivator proteins were examinedin vitro by GST pull-down analysis. As shown in Fig.6 A, 35S-labeled full-length SRC-1 showed strong in vitro interaction with purified wild-type GST-VDR-(116–427) in a 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependent manner (lanes 3–4). Only minimal interaction was detected with the liganded GST-VDR Y236A mutant (compare lanes 4 and6). No interaction was observed with purified GST (lane 2). Similarly, 35S-labeled full-length GRIP-1 showed strong interaction with purified wild-type GST-VDR-(116–427) in the presence of 10−8m1,25-(OH)2D3 which was not apparent in the absence of hormone (lanes 3–4). Purified GST-VDR-(116–427) Y236A showed only very weak interaction in the presence of hormone (lane 6) (Fig. 6 B). These findings indicate that mutant Y236A, despite retaining the ability to bind hormone and to heterodimerize with RXR, is selectively impaired in interaction with coactivator proteins both in yeast and in in vitro binding assays. Transient reporter gene expression assays in COS-7 cells were used to determine the effects of SRC-1 or GRIP-1 on 1,25-(OH)2D3-activated transcriptional activity by VDR and the Y236A mutant. As shown in Fig.7, cells were cotransfected with the full-length wild-type VDR or mutant Y236A and full-length SRC-1 or the pCR 3.1 parent vector using a (VDRE)4-TATA-GH reporter construct. Expressing the wild-type VDR showed weak transcriptional activity in the absence of hormone. However, treating these cells with 10−8m 1,25-(OH)2D3activated reporter gene expression by about 9-fold, which was further augmented nearly 3-fold by coexpression of SRC-1. The transcriptional enhancement observed with wild-type VDR was not apparent with mutant Y236A even in the presence of excess SRC-1. Similar results were obtained for both wild-type VDR and mutant Y236A in cells cotransfected with additional exogenous full-length GRIP-1. Additionally, although the wild-type VDR was maximally activated at 10−8m 1,25-(OH)2D3, the Y236A mutant was inactive even when the cells were treated with higher concentrations of ligand (10−6m) ruling out the possibility of a partial ligand-binding defect (data not shown). The overexpression of SRC-1 was previously shown to restore the transcriptional activity of a helix H3 point mutant (T277A in TRβ) (29Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar); however, we found that neither the overexpression of full-length SRC-1 or GRIP-1 could promote transactivation by the VDR mutant Y236A. These findings demonstrate that tyrosine 236 is a critical residue in the VDR for mediating activated transcription through interaction with AF-2 coactivators of the p160 family. The AF-2 domain is a small α-helix at the COOH terminus of the nuclear receptors that is required for ligand-activated transcription. The AF-2 core sequence is highly conserved throughout the nuclear receptor superfamily consisting of a centrally conserved glutamic acid residue flanked by two pairs of hydrophobic residues (6Masuyama H. Brownfield C.M. St-Arnaud R. MacDonald P.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 29Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Recently, the AF-2 domain has been shown to be the central motif through which coactivator proteins such as SRC-1 and GRIP-1 interact in a ligand-dependent manner with the nuclear receptors (3Henttu P.M. Kalkhoven E. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1832-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 4Hong H. Kohli K. Garabedian M.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell.

Brownfield C.M. St-Arnaud R. MacDonald P.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The ligand-dependent interaction between coactivators and the AF-2 helix is thought to be critical for transcriptional regulation mediated by the nuclear receptor family members. For example, in the VDR, the deletion of the AF-2 helix or subtle point mutations within its conserved residues selectively abrogates coactivator interaction (6Masuyama H. Brownfield C.M. St-Arnaud R. MacDonald P.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) as well as ligand-activated transcription (6Masuyama H. Brownfield C.M. St-Arnaud R. MacDonald P.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 12Jurutka P.W. Hsieh J.-C. Remus L.S. Whitfield G.K. Thompson P.D. Haussler C.A. Blanco J.C.G. Ozato K. Haussler M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14592-14599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Consistent with the properties of other activation domains identified in unrelated transactivating proteins, the AF-2 helix is active when assayed outside of the context of the nuclear receptor, meaning that it alone confers transactivation capacity to a heterologous DNA binding domain such as GAL4-(1–147). Specifically, for the VDR, our laboratory demonstrated that a fusion protein consisting of the VDR AF-2 helix and GAL4-(1–147) was sufficient for both transactivation and for interaction with coactivator proteins including SRC-1 (6Masuyama H. Brownfield C.M. St-Arnaud R. MacDonald P.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Importantly, in this heterologous context, both transactivation and coactivator interaction mediated through the minimal AF-2 motif were substantially weaker compared with the liganded, intact VDR. These findings suggested that other residues outside the AF-2 core domain may be required for optimal coactivator interaction and for the full transcriptional activity of the VDR. Helix H3 is an intriguing candidate region outside the AF-2 motif of the VDR that may be important for coactivator contact and transactivation. Based on the structural analyses of related nuclear receptors, helix H3 of the VDR is a putative α-helix that resides between Leu224 and Lys246 (18Wurtz J.M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified a distinct transactivation domain in the VDR that encompasses a major portion of helix H3.2 This domain alone was sufficient for transactivation, suggesting that it may serve an important role in VDR function, perhaps forming a part of a binding interface for other transcriptional regulatory proteins. Indeed, expression of the minimal helix H3 activation domain in COS-7 cells interfered with or squelched VDR-mediated transactivation, indicating that this domain interacted with limiting factors in the cell which are essential for VDR-activated transcription.2 It is possible that the helix H3 interacting proteins are distinct from the AF-2 coactivators SRC-1 and GRIP-1 of the p160 family and are selective for the helix H3 transactivation domain of the VDR. Alternatively, helices H3 and H12 in the VDR may fold in a manner that creates a single transactivation surface in which both helices are required for optimal interaction with the SRC-1/GRIP-1 family of coactivator proteins. Such a model was proposed by Barettino et al. (30Barettino D. Vivanco-Ruiz M.M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) who suggested that the activity of the AF-2 domain of nuclear receptors depends on the cooperation of a number of activation domains that are dispersed throughout the hormone binding domain and that are brought together upon ligand binding. This hypothesis is strongly supported by crystallographic data that examined the ligand-binding domain of related nuclear receptors (13Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 14Brzozowski A. Pike A. Dauter Z. Hubbard R. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G. Gustafsson J. Carlquist M.

These structural data indicate that ligand induces a dramatic structural change that involves a folding or packing of the helix H12 (AF-2 domain) onto the surface of the globular LBD core with a juxtapositioning of helix H12 and helices H3/H4. Moreover, scanning surface mutagenesis of the thyroid hormone receptor (hTRβ1) recently identified a hydrophobic cleft formed by helices H3, H5, H6, and H12 that is crucial for thyroid hormone-dependent binding of the coactivator proteins SRC-1 and GRIP-1 and for ligand-activated transcription (31Feng W. Ribeiro R.C.J. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.W. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. West B.L. Science. 1998; 280: 1747-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Cumulatively, these data suggest that ligand binding induces a repositioning of helix H12 to create a coactivator interaction surface composed of helix H12 and surrounding residues within helices H3, H5, and H6. Our current data strongly support a similar paradigm for the VDR. This was most strikingly apparent in the Y236A mutation within the VDR helix H3 activation domain. While the Y236A mutation did not affect the ability of VDR to bind ligand or to heterodimerize with RXR, alteration of this single tyrosine residue selectively impaired both 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependent interaction with the AF-2 coactivators SRC-1 and GRIP-1 as well as 1,25-(OH)2D3-activated transcription. The essential nature of this helix H3 residue in coactivator function is apparent in Fig. 7, wherein overexpression of SRC-1 or GRIP-1 dramatically augments 1,25-(OH)2D3-activated transcription mediated by wild-type VDR, but each exhibited absolutely no effect on transactivation mediated by the VDR (Y236A) mutant. Thus, in addition to the AF-2 domain, Y236 located within the helix H3 activation domain of the VDR is required for efficient interaction with coactivators of the SRC-1/GRIP-1 family and the subsequent transcriptional regulatory effects of the VDR. Asp232 of hVDR is a critical residue for transactivation mediated by the minimal helix H3 domain (Fig. 1).2 However, its role in mediating the transcriptional activity of the full-length VDR is unknown. The role of Asp232 in the intact VDR could not be tested directly because mutation of Asp232 in the full-length VDR disrupts the ligand-dependent interaction of VDR with RXR (Fig. 3) and binding of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (Fig. 4). Whether Asp232 directly contacts the ligand or if it is responsible for maintaining an important structural role required for high order binding or RXR heterodimerization remains to be determined. However, some insight may be gained from modeling studies of the ligand-binding domain of the VDR (32Wurtz J.M. Guillot B. Moras D. Vitamin D: Chemistry, Biology and Clinical Applications of the Steroid Hormone. University of California, Printing and Retrographics, Riverside, CA1997: 165-172Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of holo-RARγ, this study strongly suggests that Asp232 of hVDR (corresponding to Glu232 in RARγ) is spatially distant from the ligand (>5 Å) and does not directly contact the ligand (32Wurtz J.M. Guillot B. Moras D. Vitamin D: Chemistry, Biology and Clinical Applications of the Steroid Hormone. University of California, Printing and Retrographics, Riverside, CA1997: 165-172Google Scholar). In fact, Glu232 of RARγ (corresponding to Asp232 of hVDR) is solvent-exposed and projects out away from the ligand, residing on the outer face of helix H3 (data not shown). These structural modeling data suggest that Asp232of the VDR may not be directly involved in ligand binding, and its mutation in the full-length VDR may affect the positioning of other nearby residues that do directly contact ligand. Regardless, its putative surface localization and its key role in transactivation by the minimal domain strongly suggest that it also may play a role in the transactivation surface of the full-length receptor. An intriguing paradox arises from our studies of the VDR activation domains as well as previous work of others on related nuclear receptors. The AF-2 domain of most nuclear receptors is autonomously active when assayed outside the context of the native receptor. The same is true for the AF-1 (33Folkers G.E. van der Leede B.J. van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 616-627PubMed Google Scholar, 34Metzger D. Ali S. Bornert J.-M. Chambon P. J. Biol.

Gene (Amst.). 1994; 143: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) motifs of other nuclear receptors and the helix H3 activation domain that we identified in the VDR.2 Yet mutations that inactivate the VDR AF-2 core in the intact receptor completely abolish 1,25-(OH)2D3-activated transcription, indicating that, in the context of the full-length VDR with an inactive AF-2 domain, other resident activation functions such as the helix H3 domain are also nonfunctional. However, our data also demonstrate that inactivation of the helix H3 domain through the Y236A mutation abolishes 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated transactivation, indicating that the AF-2 domain is also nonfunctional in this context. Thus, additional structural complexities likely exist in the liganded intact receptors that preclude observation of the resident activities of the AF-2 or helix H3 activation domains, both of which are readily apparent when assayed outside the context of the full-length VDR. Moreover, the co-dependence of the AF-2 and helix H3 domains is not consistent with a mechanism that involves distinct coactivator proteins functioning exclusively through either the AF-2 or the helix H3 domains. In conclusion, although it is difficult to predict the three-dimensional positioning of specific amino acids in the VDR in the absence of any structural data, our studies suggest that Tyr236 is an important residue that may comprise a portion of the interaction surface through which p160 coactivator proteins such as SRC-1 or GRIP-1 contact the VDR. Taken together, the findings described in this manuscript and structural data of related nuclear receptors suggest that helix H3 of the VDR is a transactivation domain that functions in concert with the AF-2 domain to form a transactivation surface that mediates 1,25-(OH)2D3-/VDR-mediated transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2115114534,"The serum response element (SRE) is a promoter element essential for transcriptional activation of immediate early genes, such as c-fos and early growth response-1, by mitogenic signals. Several transcription factors bind the SRE, including the serum response factor (SRF), the ternary complex factor, and the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ). The C/EBPβ mRNA encodes three translation products of 38, 35, and 20 kDa. p35-C/EBPβ activates transcription of the SRE in an SRF-dependent fashion, whereas p20-C/EBPβ, which initiates at an internal in-frame methionine, lacks a transactivation domain and inhibits transcription. We show that SRF and C/EBPβ interact in vivo through the DNA binding domain of SRF and the C terminus of C/EBPβ common to p35/38 and p20. Therefore, like the ternary complex factor, C/EBPβ may be recruited to the SRE not only by binding to the DNA, which is not a high affinity site, but also by protein-protein interactions with SRF. Strikingly, in both the mammalian two-hybrid assay and in vivocoimmunoprecipitations, the association of SRF and p35-C/EBPβ but not p20-C/EBPβ is dramatically stimulated by activated Ras. Furthermore, mutation of the threonine within a mitogen-activated protein kinase consensus motif in the C terminus of C/EBPβ eliminates the response to Ras. These results suggest a new mechanism by which mitogenic signals may influence transcription activity of the SRE by selectively promoting protein-protein interactions between SRF and the transactivator p35-C/EBPβ."
https://openalex.org/W1998954201,"Previous studies identified two intrinsic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, isozyme 1 (11β-HSD) and the 50-kDa esterase (E3), sharing some amino acid sequence motifs in their N-terminal transmembrane (TM) domains. Both are type II membrane proteins with the C terminus projecting into the lumen of the ER. This finding implied that the N-terminal TM domains of 11β-HSD and E3 may constitute a lumenal targeting signal (LTS). To investigate this hypothesis we created chimeric fusions using the putative targeting sequences and the reporter gene, Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein. Transfected COS cells expressing LTS-green fluorescent protein chimeras were examined by fluorescent microscopy and electron microscopic immunogold labeling. The orientation of expressed chimeras was established by immunocytofluorescent staining of selectively permeabilized COS cells. In addition, protease protection assays of membranes in the presence and absence of detergents was used to confirm lumenal or the cytosolic orientation of the constructed chimeras. To investigate the general applicability of the proposed LTS, we fused the N terminus of E3 to the N terminus of the NADH-cytochromeb5 reductase lacking the myristoyl group and N-terminal 30-residue membrane anchor. The orientation of the cytochromeb5 reductase was reversed, from cytosolic to lumenal projection of the active domain. These observations establish that an amino acid sequence consisting of short basic or neutral residues at the N terminus, followed by a specific array of hydrophobic residues terminating with acidic residues, is sufficient for lumenal targeting of single-pass proteins that are structurally and functionally unrelated."

Nevertheless, the limited number of known examples hampers the identification of common mechanisms that regulate translation of specific groups of genes in mammalian cells.

Translational control of eukaryotic gene expression can be broadly classified into two major categories: global control affecting the overall rate of protein synthesis, and selective control in which the translation rate of mRNA subsets varies in response to biological stimuli (1Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 2Merrick W.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N.

Regulation of eukaryotic gene expression during developmental processes, such as germ cell maturation and early embryonic development in Xenopus, Caenorhabditis elegans, andDrosophila, was demonstrated to involve selective translation of certain mRNA species (see Ref. 11Wickers M. Kimble J. Strickland S. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 433-450Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, however, the translation of only few mRNAs was shown to be regulated by gene-specific mechanisms during differentiation. The most characterized example of this type of regulation is the translation of 15-lipoxygenase mRNA during red blood cell differentiation (8Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Previously, two approaches were used to identify and isolate specific mRNAs translationally regulated during differentiation. One approach was based on the pulse-chase labeling of cells with radioactive amino acids, followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to identify relative changes in the translation pattern. Candidate proteins were further characterized using various biochemical methods, and their corresponding cDNAs were cloned and used to quantify their respective mRNA levels (12Jefferies H.B.J. Thomas G. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4367-4372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Thomas G. Thomas G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2137-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The second approach was based on the assumption that translationally inactive mRNAs are present as free cytoplasmic mRNPs, whereas actively translated mRNAs are contained within polysomes. To isolate and identify mRNAs selectively mobilized from mRNPs 1The abbreviations used are: RNP, ribonucleoprotein; 5′-TOP, 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactio; DDRT-PCR, differential display RT-PCR; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-1-phorbol-13-acetate; BMV, Brome mosaic virus to polysomes, cDNA probes were prepared from mRNPs and polysomes and hybridized against cDNA libraries (14Loreni F. Francesconi A. Jappelli R. Amaldi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1859-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 15Yenofsky R. Bergmann I. Brawerman G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3909-3913Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These studies, although limited to the relatively abundant mRNAs, led to the identification of a group of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins, elongation factors for protein synthesis, and proteins of as yet unknown function (14Loreni F. Francesconi A. Jappelli R. Amaldi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1859-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). More recent studies have established that translational efficiency of these mRNAs correlates with the rate of cell proliferation (16Avni D. Shama S. Loreni F. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3822-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The cis element in this type of translationally controlled mRNAs was found to be a 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract (5′-TOP), and they were termed 5′-TOP mRNAs (16Avni D. Shama S. Loreni F. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3822-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this study a new protocol based on the separation of polysomes from mRNPs using sucrose gradient centrifugation followed by differential display RT-PCR analysis is presented. This methodology identifies new mRNAs specifically mobilized from cytoplasmic free mRNPs onto polysomes and vice versa in the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 during cellular differentiation. Our findings suggest that Alu-like elements within cytoplasmic mRNAs are involved in gene-specific translation regulation.

Restriction endonucleases and Random Priming Reagent kit were provided by New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA); AMV-Reverse Transcriptase, Taq DNA-polymerase, RiboMAXTM Large Scale RNA Production System, wheat germ extract, and rabbit reticulocyte nuclease-treated lysates were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). The rapid amplification of 5′ cDNA ends kit was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Nylon membranes and radiochemicals were purchased from NEN Life Science Products Inc. (Boston, MA). The human cell lines K562 and HL-60 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum,l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were routinely passaged twice a week to a density of 0.5–1.0 × 106 cells/ml and grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Induction of differentiation (30 ml of 4 × 105cells/ml for 140-mm plate) was performed by the addition of 50 nm TPA, 100 nm 1,25-dehydroxyvitamin D3, or 1.25% dimethyl sulfoxide. Cell harvesting and sucrose gradient separation between polysomal and subpolysomal fractions were performed as described previously (17Meyuhas O. Thompson J.R. Perry R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2691-2699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed at 4 °C, and the postmitochondrial supernatant was overlaid onto a 15–45% sucrose gradient and spun at 26,000 rpm for 4 h at 4 °C. Fractions of polysomes (up to disomes) and subpolysomes (from 80 S to RNPs) were collected from the bottom of each gradient with continuous monitoring at 260 nm and precipitated with 0.1 mNaCl and 2.5 volumes of ethanol, the pellets were dissolved in guanidine thiocyanate and further purified by centrifugation through CsCl (18Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Purified RNA preparations were quantified by spectrophotometry. For Northern blot analysis, RNA was denatured in glyoxal and subjected to electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer. The RNA was transferred to a nylon-based membrane, hybridized with the indicated32P-random primed labeled probe, washed, and exposed to x-ray film as described (19Rosen H. Polakiewicz R. Brain Res. Dev. 1989; 46: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The DNA probes were specific cDNAs, prepared by PCR and labeled by random priming. For RT-PCR analysis first-strand cDNA was synthesized with avian myeloblastosis virus-RT in the presence of 1 μg of total RNA, 1.5 μm oligo(dT) primer, 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 40 mm KCl, 6 mmMgCl2, 10 units of RNase inhibitor, and 10 units of avian myeloblastosis virus-RT in a final volume of 10 μl. Reaction was carried out for 45 min at 42 °C followed by heat inactivation for 5 min in 75 °C. For each PCR reaction we used 2 μl of the cDNA reaction mixture, 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 2 units ofTaq polymerase, 1 times the corresponding reaction buffer provided with the enzyme, and a pair of PCR-specific primers (50 pmol of each). The amplification was performed for 15–40 cycles (each cycle consisted of 1 min at 93 °C, 1 min at 58 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C). The PCR products were then separated on 2.5% NuSieve 3:1 agarose gel. The following gene-specific primers were used (the sequences are written from 5′ to 3′): GGAACATGCTGAGAAACTG and CAGGGTGTGCTTGTCAAAG for H-ferritin; TCACCAACTGGGACGACATG and GTACAGGGATAGCACAGCCT for b-actin; ATCCCCAGAAGCAGCATGAC, TGCAGAGTGCCGAGAAATCC and CCCATTTCATGCCGTCCTG for TA 90 (fibulin 1D); CTCACACACACAACCATCC and GGAGTCTGGCTGTATTGTCC for TA 40; GGGAAAGCTTTCTAGTCTA and GTACTTAGGATAGCAGTAC for TA 10; GCTTGGGCCTTCCTCCATC and CTCTGTACACCCAGGAGTC for TA 12; CTGTTCCTAATGAGCAGGGC and TCAAAACTCACACGGCAGC for TA 20; GTTAGACCCCAATGAGACC and CACATTCCCCTTCACCTTC for TR (TR 11); GTCTCAAGGTGTTTGACGG and AGGAGTCCGTGGGTCTTGA for TR 10; ATCTCCTTCATCCCTCTCC and GCTTTTAGTGCTGCTTCCTC for TR 13; AGACCCTCACTGGCAAAAC and TGACCTTCTTCTTGGGACG for TR 40; CCGCAAACTCTGTCTCAAC and GGCCTCCTCTTTGCTGATT for TR 80; GTAACTCCACCAAGCCCATC and CCCTCTTTTCTTTTCCTCCC for VDR; TGCAGGTGGCAGAGTGAATG and CAAGAGATTGGGGGGTGAAG for PAI-1; GATTATGTCCGGCCACGTTC and ACCCAGCCCCACAAAAAAAG for acyl-CoA; TCTCTCCTCCCTTTCTTCCC and TCCTTCCTCTGCTTCTCACC for Il-6R; CTGCGGAGATCACACTGAC and GCTCTTCCTCCTACACATC for HLA; GAGTCTGCTGAAGCTATCC and AGTCTACACCACAACCACC for RepA. For the semiquantitative RT-PCR the number of amplification cycles was limited in order to maintain the PCR reaction within the linear range. The optimal number of cycles for each pair of primers was determined by withdrawn aliquots of the corresponding reactions for agarose gel analysis after various number of cycles. The number of cycles sufficient for detecting clearly visible bands was chosen. The relative intensity of the DNA bands remained the same for at least four additional cycles. Differential display of 0.5 μg of total RNA from polysomes and from subpolysomes before and after cell treatment was performed essentially as described by Liang and Pardee (20Liang P. Pardee A.B.

For reverse transcription, 13 units/μl of Super Script II RT (Life Technologies, Inc., Bethesda, MD) were used. PCR reactions were performed with combinations of 10 different arbitrary 10-mer primers (50% GC, sense primers) and 5 different 5′-T12MN-3′ primers (antisense primers, where MN were GG, GC, CG, GA, or AT). The PCR products were labeled with 50 nm32P (3000 Ci/mmol), separated by 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and detected by autoradiography. DNA was eluted from the differentially amplified bands, reamplified by PCR as described (20Liang P. Pardee A.B. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Sequence analysis was carried out with GCG supplied programs. The HL-60 unidirectional cDNA library (obtained from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, number 950-07) was constructed in pcDNA I vector usingNotI dT primer and transfected into the Escherichia coli MC1061/PC. Screening of the HL-60 cell line cDNA library was performed by in situ hybridization with a radioactive labeled probe (22Strauss W.M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1995: 6.3.1-6.3.6Google Scholar). The DNA templates for in vitro transcription and translation were either the TA-40 pcDNA I plasmid linearized at the XhoI site (S1) or TA-40 derived fragments. These fragments were obtained by PCR reactions with T7 promoter primer TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG in combination with each of the following TA-40 specific primers: CTCACACACACAACCATCC (S2), CGGATTTGGGAAACTTTTCTATAAA (S3), and AGCTGTGCTTTACATAGCAATCTT (S4). Transcription reactions with T7 RNA polymerase were performed using the Ribo MAXTM Large Scale RNA Production System as recommended by the supplier. The quality of the synthesized RNA was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. Protein synthesis assays were carried in a standard micrococcal nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate reaction mixture according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions containing BMV or luciferase transcripts as templates were incubated for 40 min at 30 °C in the presence of [35S]methionine. Aliquots were spotted onto 1-cm square filters and hot trichloroacetic acid percipitable radioactivity was determined. Where indicated, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly[I]·poly[C]) or TA-40 derived transcripts were added to the translation reaction prior to the addition of BMV or luciferase transcripts. All results are representative of at least three independent experiments. To identify genes whose expression is translationally regulated, we combined a sucrose gradient separation of polysomes from mRNPs with DDRT-PCR analysis and cDNA cloning. Polysomal and subpolysomal RNAs were purified from cells before and after treatment. These RNA samples were subjected to a DDRT-PCR analysis and the radioactive labeled cDNA products were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This protocol is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. Distribution of RNAs between polysomal and subpolysomal fractions is indicated by the relative intensity of the bands of the same electrophoretic mobility in adjacent lanes of the autoradiogram. Differences in the distribution of the intensities of bands found in treated cells relative to nontreated cells pointed toward candidates for translationally regulated transcripts (see arrows in Fig. 1). The bands' intensity was changed linearly in the range of 28–40 PCR cycles and thus, even small differences in mRNA distribution could be detected (data not shown). To confirm the validity of this experimental approach, the regulation of ferritin expression was re-examined. Ferritin biosynthesis is a classical model for gene-specific translational control (23Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 24Melefors O. Hentze M.W. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This model of iron-dependent regulation was thoroughly investigated and established in a number of cell lines, including the K562 human erythroleukemia cells (25Mattia E. Josic D. Ashwell G. Klausner R. van Renswoude J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4587-4593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that were used in this study as a test model. K562 cells were grown in suspension to a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml and then divided to untreated control culture and to experimental culture that was exposed to 100 mmhemin-iron for 4 h. Cytoplasmic RNA was separated by centrifugation on sucrose gradients and analyzed (Fig.2 A). The RNAs from polysomal and subpolysomal fractions were extracted separately. 10 μg of RNA from each fraction were subjected to a Northern blot analysis with32P-labeled human H-ferritin cDNA probe (Fig.2 B). In the untreated cells most of the H-ferritin mRNA sedimented with the subpolysomal fraction (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1and 2), whereas, in the hemin-treated cells H-ferritin mRNA was equally distributed between the polysomal and subpolysomal fractions (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 4). Similar results were obtained by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis performed with specific human H-ferritin primers (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). These results confirmed the iron-dependent mobilization of H-ferritin mRNA onto polysomes in K562 cells. It is worthwhile to mention that in these cells ferritin biosynthesis was reported to be regulated at the mRNA level as well (26Mattia E. den-Blaauwen J. Ashwell G. van-Renswoude J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1801-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). RNAs from the same samples were subjected to DDRT-PCR analysis (as described under “Experimental Procedures”); the 10-mer arbitrary oligonucleotides upstream primers used were: 1) 5′-AAGGTAGTGC-3′, 2) 5′-CTTGATTGCC-3′, 3) 5′-GCTATCACAG-3′; and the T12MN anchored primers were: 4) 5′-T12CG-3′, 5) 5′-T12AG-3′, and 6) 5′-T12AT-3′. The sequences of primers 1 and 4 were derived from the 3′-untranslated region of the human H-ferritin mRNA (27Chou C.C. Gatti R.A. Fuller M.L. Concan P. Wong A. Chada S. Davis R.C. Salser W.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The sequence of primer 1 is located 120 nucleotides upstream to the poly(A) addition site, whereas primer 4 is the H-ferritin mRNA-specific anchored primer. For a given RNA preparation, the DDRT-PCR reactions generated highly reproducible mobility patterns of 30–100 distinct bands, depending on the combination of primers. The relative intensity patterns of the bands of the same electrophoretic mobility in adjacent lanes (from control and treated cells) were reproducible only in 70–80%. Therefore, it was necessary to run the DDRT-PCR analysis in duplicate. An autoradiogram of the DDRT-PCR analysis, performed with the combination of primers numbers 1 and 4 and exposed for 2 h, is shown in Fig.2 C. An additional 25 bands appeared after a 12-h exposure (data not shown). The arrow on the autoradiogram points at bands with an estimated size of 130 nucleotides. Isolation and sequencing of these DNA fragments confirmed that they corresponded to the H-ferritin cDNA. Comparison between the signals in lanes 1 and 2 (control) and those in lanes 3 and4 (hemin-treated) indicated that the DDRT-PCR analysis produced similar results to those obtained by Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses (Fig. 2, B and C). This demonstrated the feasibility to identify mobilization of specific mRNAs onto polysomes using the DDRT-PCR analysis. Promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 is one of the best studied models of cell differentiation (28Birnie G.D. Br. J. Cancer. 1988; 58: 41-45Google Scholar, 29Tsiftsoglou A.S. Robinson S.H. Int. J. Cell. Cloning. 1985; 3: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This culture comprises 90–95% of cells with myeloblastic/promyelocytic morphology. A variety of agents can induce differentiation of these cells either to granulocyte-like (dimethyl sulfoxide) or to monocyte/macrophage-like (TPA or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) cells (28Birnie G.D. Br. J. Cancer. 1988; 58: 41-45Google Scholar). Differentiation of HL-60 cells into monocyte/macrophage-like cells was induced with 50 nm TPA. After 24 h of induction, proliferation was arrested, and almost all the cells adhered in aggregates to the plastic dish; then they spread out and acquired a spindle-shaped morphology and prominent pseudopodia. This series of events was confirmed microscopically in all experiments. To compare the polysomal profiles of HL-60 cells during their differentiation, cytoplasmic RNA from noninduced control, 12-, 24-, and 48-h treated cells was analyzed following centrifugation on sucrose gradients (Fig. 3 A). The relative amount of polysomes decreased gradually during the course of cellular differentiation (Fig. 3 A), reflecting the growth arrest and inhibition of overall protein synthesis associated with cellular differentiation. To identify transcripts whose translation was specifically regulated, we isolated RNAs from polysomal and subpolysomal fractions of control and TPA-treated cells, and examined them by differential display analysis (Figs. 3 B and5 A). Thirty DDRT-PCR reactions, employing various combinations of primers on each RNA sample, produced a total of about 2500 different bands. Assuming that an average of 15,000 different species of mRNAs are expressed per cell, our analysis covered about 15% of the cellular RNAs. Most bands in this analysis represented RNA species with unaltered polysomal/subpolysomal distribution and thus provided multiple internal controls. Some mRNA species (type A) were found both in polysomal and subpolysomal fractions, both before and after treatment (Fig. 3 B, m and p, in bothcon and 24-h lanes). Other species (type B) were present in subpolysomes only (about 10%, in m lanes only), or were found exclusively in polysomes (type C; about 5%, in p lanes only). Type B represents untranslated RNAs, whereas type C consists of RNAs that are apparently translated very efficiently, and therefore likely to be translationally regulated. In this study, however, only specific mRNAs whose translation was affected by cellular differentiation were further investigated.Figure 5Identification of mobilized transcripts during differentiation of HL-60 cells. A, differential display RT-PCR analysis of polysomal (p) and nonpolysomal (m) fractions of 48-h TPA-treated cells (48 h) or control untreated cells (con). The 10-mer arbitrary oligonucleotides upstream primers used in these experiments were: (i) 5′-GCTATCACAG-3′; (ii) 5′-GTCATGCACA-3′; (iii) 5′-TGGATCCAAG-3′; (iv) 5′-ATTGGGAAGG-3′. The open arrows point at the bands corresponding to candidates for translationally activated RNAs (TAs).B, RT-PCR analysis of TA transcripts, performed on nonpolysomal (lanes 1 and 3) and polysomal (lanes 2 and 4) fractions of control (lanes 1 and 2) or 48-h TPA-treated cells (lanes 3and 4) with TA 10, 12, 20, and 90 specific primers.C, RT-PCR analysis of nonpolysomal (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9) and polysomal (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) fractions of control (lanes 1 and2) or 12- (lanes 3 and 4), 24- (lanes 5 and 6), 48- (lanes 7 and8), and 72- (lanes 9 and 10) h TPA-treated cells. TA-40 (TA40), actin (AC), and H-ferritin (FE) specific primers were used in these reactions (see “Expermental Procedures” for details).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of RNA from 24-h treated cells revealed few candidates for specifically repressed RNAs (arrows in Figs. 3 Band 4 a). In these cases bands derived from control cells exhibited usually similar intensities in subpolysomes and polysomes, whereas in treated cells the intensity of the bands from subpolysomes was much higher than that of the polysomes (arrows in Figs.3 B and 4 A). These DNA bands (designated TR10, 11, 13, 40, and 80) were purified from the gels, amplified, cloned, and used as probes for RNA blot analysis of 10 μg of total RNA from different fractions. Autoradiograms of these analyses are presented in Fig. 4 B. It is evident that most of the corresponding mRNAs in the 24-h treated cells were found in subpolysomal fractions (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3 and4). Comparison between the signals in lanes 1 and2 (control) and those in lanes 3 and 4(treated) indicates that the later mRNAs were no longer associated with the polysomes upon differentiation (Fig. 4 B). Semiquantitative analysis revealed no significant changes in the total amount of TR mRNAs during the early stages of HL-60 cellular differentiation (data not shown). The kinetics of translational repression of these TR genes was studied by semiquantitative specific RT-PCR. An example of such analysis is shown in Fig. 4 C. The release of TR-RNA from the polysomes was detected 12 h after TPA treatment (compare lanes 1 and 2, control, tolanes 3 and 4, 12-h treated). Expression of actin mRNA (AC) was determined by Northern blot (Fig. 4 B) and RT-PCR (Fig. 4 C) analysis to test the specificity of the observed phenomena. It is worthwhile to mention that actin mRNA was always found predominantly in polysomal fractions. The TR clones (TR 10, 11, 80, 13, and 40) were sequenced. Search for homologous sequences in the Gene Banks revealed that these clones derived from the 3′ termini of the human mRNAs for ribosomal proteins L13a, L19, L11, S27 and the mRNA for ubiquitin 52 amino acid fusion protein (the natural hybrid between ubiquitin monomer and ribosomal protein), respectively. All five transcripts were relatively short mRNAs (from ∼340 to ∼700 nucleotides) with polypyrimidines at their 5′ end, indicating the possibility that they were members of the 5′-TOP mRNA family. These results are in agreement with the accepted concept of translational repression of 5′-TOP's mRNAs in nonproliferating cells (for review, see Ref. 30Meyuhas O. Avni D. Shama S. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 363-388Google Scholar). Further analysis of the 48-h TPA-treated cells revealed, in addition to the TR genes, 10 specific bands with relative enhanced intensity in the polysomal fraction (some of them are labeled by arrows in Fig. 5 A). These bands represented mRNA candidates for translationally activated genes and were designated TA genes. They were isolated from the gels, amplified, cloned, sequenced, and used as probes for RNA blot analysis. We could not detect the corresponding RNAs in the Northern blot analysis of HL-60 total RNA (20 μg), probably due to their low abundance in these cells. Therefore, eight pairs of TA-specific primers were used in semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 5, B andC). This analysis confirmed that five out of the eight tested TA transcripts represented mRNAs that were mobilized onto polysomes upon differentiation (see TA-12, 20, 90, and 40 in Fig. 5,B and C; TA 10*"
https://openalex.org/W2036078565,"In rat brain and cultured neuroendocrine PC12 cells, Glut3 is localized at the cell surface and, also, in a distinct population of homogenous synaptic-like vesicles. Glut3-containing vesicles co-purify with “classical” synaptic vesicles, but can be separated from the latter by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Unlike classical synaptic vesicles, Glut3-containing vesicles possess a high level of aminopeptidase activity, which has been identified as aminopeptidase B. This enzyme has recently been shown to be a marker of the secretory pathway in PC12 cells (Balogh, A., Cadel, S., Foulon, T., Picart, R., Der Garabedian, A., Rousselet, A., Tougard, C., and Cohen, P. (1998) J. Cell Sci. 111, 161–169). We, therefore, conclude that Glut3 is targeted to secretory vesicles in both neurons and PC12 cells. In rat brain and cultured neuroendocrine PC12 cells, Glut3 is localized at the cell surface and, also, in a distinct population of homogenous synaptic-like vesicles. Glut3-containing vesicles co-purify with “classical” synaptic vesicles, but can be separated from the latter by sucrose gradient centrifugation.

(1998) J. Cell Sci. 111, 161–169). We, therefore, conclude that Glut3 is targeted to secretory vesicles in both neurons and PC12 cells. Glucose transporters represent a family of proteins that are responsible for the cellular uptake of glucose and are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells in a tissue-specific fashion (1Mueckler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Normally, these proteins function at the cell surface and recycle between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartment(s) at a rate that depends on the type of cell as well as the isoform of the transporter protein. The distribution of glucose transporters between the plasma and intracellular membranes is strictly regulated, because this distribution has a major impact on glucose uptake and, hence, cellular energy metabolism as well as on maintaining glucose homeostasis in the blood. This is certainly true for the fat and muscle-specific transporter isoform, Glut4, and, to some extent, for the “ubiquitous” transporter isoform, Glut1, both of which traffic in competent cells under tight insulin control (reviewed in Refs. 1Mueckler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar and2Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E1-E14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glut3, which is expressed to some degree in cultured L6 muscle cells, has also been shown to redistribute to the plasma membrane after insulin or insulin growth factor-1 treatment (3Bilan P.J. Mitsumoto Y. Maher F. Simpson I.A. Klip A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, Glut3 is expressed in platelets in which it is translocated from α-granules to the cell surface in response to thrombin, a phenomenon that may reflect increased energy requirements of platelets upon activation (4Heijnen H.F.G. Oorschot V. Sixma J.J. Slot J.W. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 5Sorbara L.R. Davies-Hill T.M. Koehler-Stec E.M. Vannucci S.J. Horne M.K. Simpson I.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The major Glut3-expressing tissue, however, is brain (1Mueckler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 6Maher F. Vannucci S.J. Simpson I.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1003-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), and it is unknown whether Glut3 function in brain may be regulated by compartmentalization. We, therefore, studied the intracellular localization of Glut3 in rat brain as well as in cultured rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Although the major part of the Glut3 moiety in both brain and PC12 cells is localized in the plasma membrane, a fraction of the transporter has been found inside the cell. Intracellular Glut3 is present in a biochemically homogenous population of membrane vesicles, which are co-purified with classical synaptic vesicles but can be separated from the latter in equilibrium density and velocity sucrose gradients. A unique feature of Glut3-containing vesicles that allows one to easily discriminate them from classical synaptic vesicles, which otherwise have a very similar protein composition (7Thoidis G. Pushkin A. Chen P. Vallega G. Leeman S. Fine R.E. Kandror K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1998; 95: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), is the presence of aminopeptidase activity. We have determined that this activity belongs to aminopeptidase B, which has recently been shown to represent a marker of the regulated secretory pathway in PC12 cells (8Balogh A. Cadel S. Foulon T. Picart R. DerGarabedian A. Rousselet A. Tougard C. Cohen P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 161-169PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we suggest that Glut3-containing vesicles represent a novel secretory compartment in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. We have also found Glut3 in clathrin-coated vesicles, suggesting that Glut3 may recycle between the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes viaa clathrin-mediated pathway. Affinity purified anti-Glut3 antibody was from Charles River Pharmservices. Antibody to clathrin heavy chain was from ICN. Antibody to synaptophysin was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Antibodies to SV2 and synaptotagmin were kind gifts from Dr. K. Buckley (Harvard Medical School). Antibody to synaptobrevin was a kind gift from Dr. R. Jahn (Max Plank Institute, Gottingen). The pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Confluent 15-cm plates were rinsed twice at 4 °C with buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm MgCl2). Cells were scraped from dishes into 1–2 ml of buffer per plate, and homogenized with 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer followed by passage through a 25 gauge needle 10 times. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100 ×g for 5 min, followed by centrifugation of the resulting supernatant (S1) at 27,000 × g for 35 min to yield a pellet and supernatant (S2) (9Desnos C. Clift-O'Grady L. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Total intracellular membranes were pelleted by centrifugation of supernatant S2 at 180,000 ×g for 2 h and centrifuged on a 10–30% (w/w) sucrose velocity gradient for 50 min at 48,000 rpm in a SW50.1 rotor. Fractions were collected and analyzed for synaptic vesicle proteins. Fractions in the gradient that were enriched in SV2, synaptophysin and synaptobrevin, were pooled, pelleted, and reapplied on a 10–50% (w/v) sucrose equilibrium density gradient and centrifuged for 18 h at 48,000 rpm in a SW50.1 rotor. Fractions were collected starting from the bottom of the gradient and blotted for GLUT3 as well as for individual synaptic vesicle proteins. Synaptosomes were prepared from rat brains according to the procedure of Huttner et al. (10Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. DeCamilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). The resulting synaptosomal pellet was diluted with 9 volumes of ice cold H2O (hypotonic lysis of synaptosomes to release synaptic vesicles) and immediately homogenized with three strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. 1m HEPES, pH 7.4, was added to a final concentration of 7.5 mm HEPES, and the homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 25,500 × g to remove the synaptosomal membrane. The supernatant was centrifuged for 2 h at 48,000 rpm, in a Ti60 rotor, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 30 mm sucrose, 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and homogenized by passage through a 25 gauge needle 5 times back and forth. This material was loaded on a continuous gradient of 50–800 mmsucrose, 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and the gradient was centrifuged for 5 h at 22,000 rpm in an AH627 rotor. Fractions containing synaptic vesicle marker proteins were pooled, pelleted by centrifugation at 48,000 rpm for 2 h, resuspended in buffer A and then loaded onto an equilibrium density sucrose gradient (10–50% (w/v) in buffer A) and centrifuged at 48,000 rpm for 18 h in a SW50.1 rotor. For velocity centrifugation, material from the equilibrium density gradient was further fractionated in 10–30% (w/w) gradients in a SW50.1 rotor at 48,000 rpm for 55 min. Following each centrifugation, fractions were collected starting from the bottom of the gradient and analyzed for the total protein content, presence of specific proteins by Western blotting, and aminopeptidase activity. Clathrin-coated vesicles were purified from rat brain in MES 1The abbreviations used are: MES, morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline buffer (0.1m MES, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmMgCl2, pH 6.5) by the procedure of Maycox et al.(11Maycox P.R. Link E. Reetz A. Morris S.A. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The final pellet containing purified coated vesicles was resuspended in 0.2 ml of MES buffer, and coated vesicles were then centrifuged in an equilibrium density sucrose gradient (20–65% (w/v) in MES buffer, pH 6.5) at 48, 000 rpm for 18 h in a SW50.1 rotor. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradient and analyzed for total protein and for specific proteins by Western blotting. Fractions that were positive for clathrin as well as for the synaptic vesicle proteins SV2, synaptophysin, and synaptobrevin were further purified by recentrifugation in an additional equilibrium sucrose gradient (20–65% w/v) for 18 h. To separate proteins by anion exchange chromatography, membrane samples were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 for at least 2 h at 4 °C, centrifuged, and applied to a 1-ml Pharmacia Mono-Q column equilibrated with buffer A with 50 mm NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100. Elution was carried out with a linear gradient of NaCl (final concentration 0.5 m, total volume of the gradient 30 ml) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fifty 1-ml fractions were collected for analysis of the total protein content, aminopeptidase activity and for Western blotting. The concentration of NaCl in the gradient fractions was re-evaluated with a digital conductivity meter. Protein solutions (up to 1 mg in 0.15–0.20 ml) in 1% Triton X-100 in buffer A (clarified by centrifugation for 15 min in a Microfuge) was loaded on a 5–20% sucrose gradient (total volume. 4.6 ml) prepared in buffer A with 0.1% Triton X-100 and spun for 16 h at 33,000 rpm in a SW-50.1 rotor. The gradients were separated into 46 fractions starting from the bottom of the tube for analysis of the total protein content, aminopeptidase activity, and for Western blotting. Standard proteins, bovine serum albumin (67 kDa) and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (141 kDa), were analyzed in separate tubes. Fractions (10 μl) from the gradient were mixed in the presence of 1% Triton X-100, with 1 mm (final concentration) arginine-β-naphthylamide (0.5 ml) in a total volume of 1.5 ml of buffer A. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and fluorescence in the fractions was measured at 410 nm. The excitation wavelength was 340 nm. PC12 cells grown on coverslips for 2 days were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS containing 4% sucrose for 30 min, then washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked with 4% donkey serum, and stained with affinity purified antibody against Glut3 followed by Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Each incubation with antibody lasted for 60 min at room temperature. SlowFade-Light Antifade kit (Molecular Probes) was used for mounting cells on slides. Staining was examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Bio-Rad, Microscope Division; MRC/600). Glut3-containing vesicles purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation were pelleted, resuspended in PBS to a final concentration 0.1–0.5 mg/ml, and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Formvar-carbon coated nickel grids were layed on 25-μl drops of vesicle suspension for 1–5 min. Grids were then stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 30 s, dried, and viewed through a Phillips transmission electron microscope. Micrographs were taken at magnification × 10,000–48,000. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206999) Google Scholar) and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine. Following transfer, the membrane was blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C and probed with specific antibodies. Autoradiograms were quantitated in a computing densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). Protein content was determined with the BCA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fig. 1 shows localization of Glut3 in the neuroendocrine PC12 cell line by immunofluorescent staining. In this figure, it is evident that in addition to the plasma membrane, Glut3 is present in an intracellular perinuclear compartment. To understand the nature of this intracellular Glut3-containing compartment, we fractionated PC12 cells as described previously (9Desnos C. Clift-O'Grady L. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). After cell homogenization, heavy subcellular structures and the plasma membrane were removed by pelleting, and the resulting intracellular membranes were fractionated in a linear equilibrium density gradient as described under “Materials and Methods.” Under these conditions, Glut3-containing intracellular membranes have a very narrow density distribution that substantially, although not completely, overlaps with the position of the synaptic vesicle marker proteins SV2 and synaptophysin, with Glut3-containing vesicles having a buoyant density less than synaptic vesicles (Fig. 2). The limited amount of the material available from cultured cells did not allow us to purify intracellular Glut3-containing vesicles from PC12 cells in the preparative amounts that were required for detailed biochemical analysis of this compartment. Therefore, further characterization of Glut3-containing vesicles was performed using rat brain as a source of biological material. In the following experiments, we took advantage of a well established procedure for the isolation and subcellular fractionation of synaptosomes (10Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. DeCamilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Briefly, we isolated synaptosomes from rat brain, lysed them with osmotic shock, removed synaptic membranes, and purified intra-synaptosomal membranes by preparative sucrose gradient centrifugation (10Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. DeCamilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). This preparation was fractionated further by equilibrium density sucrose gradient centrifugation as shown in Fig.3 and as described previously (7Thoidis G. Pushkin A. Chen P. Vallega G. Leeman S. Fine R.E. Kandror K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1998; 95: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This procedure allows the separation of the intra-synaptosomal membrane material into two major peaks according to their buoyant densities (7Thoidis G. Pushkin A. Chen P. Vallega G. Leeman S. Fine R.E. Kandror K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1998; 95: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), one of which is likely to represent classical synaptic vesicles (7Thoidis G. Pushkin A. Chen P. Vallega G. Leeman S. Fine R.E. Kandror K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1998; 95: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The nature of the second less dense population of vesicles remains unknown. Fig. 3 shows that Glut3 is specifically enriched in this second population of vesicles. Based on these results, we conclude that the buoyant density distribution of Glut3 vesicles and synaptic vesicles in PC12 cells (Fig. 2) and rat brain (Fig. 3) is very similar if not identical. As we have shown earlier (7Thoidis G. Pushkin A. Chen P. Vallega G. Leeman S. Fine R.E. Kandror K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1998; 95: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and reconfirm here, this second population of “synaptic-like” vesicles from rat brain, unlike classical synaptic vesicles, possesses a high level of aminopeptidase activity (Fig. 3), which serves as a convenient and reliable marker of this compartment and allows one to readily distinguish the two populations of vesicles. The peak 2 fractions, which contained both Glut3 and aminopeptidase, were pooled and, following pelleting, recentrifuged in a sucrose velocity gradient (Fig. 4). Under these conditions, the Glut3-containing material sediments as homogeneous vesicles whose distribution completely overlaps with the total protein profile and also with synaptic vesicle marker proteins and aminopeptidase activity. Data presented in Fig. 4 suggest that Glut3-containing vesicles at this purification step are close to homogeneity. This was confirmed by electron microscopy (Fig. 5), which demonstrated that this preparation consists of homogenous round-shaped vesicles with an average diameter of 47 ± 5 nm. Using electron microscopy, we could not find any significant differences between Glut3-containing synaptic-like vesicles and classical synaptic vesicles (not shown). To identify aminopeptidase activity associated with Glut3-vesicles, we used an antibody against aminopeptidase B described by Cadel et al.(13Cadel S. Pierotti A.R. Foulon T. Creminon C. Barre N. Segretain D. Cohen P. Mol. Cel. Endocrinol. 1995; 110: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For these experiments, we solubilized Glut3-containing vesicles in 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged this material in a 5–20% linear sucrose gradient. Under these conditions, aminopeptidase activity sediments as one peak corresponding to a protein of ∼70 kDa and completely overlaps with the distribution of aminopeptidase B as determined by Western blotting (Fig.6). In the next experiment, we fractionated Triton-solubilized Glut3-containing vesicles on a Mono-Q column (Fig.7). Unlike sucrose gradient centrifugation, fast protein liquid chromatography allows the separation of aminopeptidase activity into two peaks, the major of which co-elutes with aminopeptidase B. The nature of the minor peak remains unknown, although it may represent a degradation product of the major peak or may result from binding of aminopeptidase B to other proteins. Thus, we conclude that aminopeptidase B is the only or, at least, the major aminopeptidase present in Glut3-containing vesicles. Because aminopeptidase B has recently been shown to be targeted to the regulated secretory pathway in PC12 cells (8Balogh A. Cadel S. Foulon T. Picart R. DerGarabedian A. Rousselet A. Tougard C. Cohen P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 161-169PubMed Google Scholar), we believe that Glut3-containing vesicles, which we describe here, represent a secretory compartment in both PC12 cells and neurons. Glucose transporter proteins, Glut1, and Glut4, in particular, are known to recycle between the plasma membrane and an intracellular storage compartment. To determine whether this may also be the case for Glut3, we isolated clathrin-coated vesicles from rat brain according to the procedure of Maycox et al. (11Maycox P.R. Link E. Reetz A. Morris S.A. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and fractionated them in an equilibrium density sucrose gradient (Fig. 8). Glut3 is clearly present in clathrin-coated vesicles suggesting that this isoform of glucose transporter recycles in neurons, although the quantitative parameters of this recycling have yet to be determined. In this study, we examine the intracellular localization of Glut3, the predominant glucose transporter isoform in brain. We show that Glut3 is present in a distinct homogenous population of synaptic-like vesicles that we have recently identified in rat brain (7Thoidis G. Pushkin A. Chen P. Vallega G. Leeman S. Fine R.E. Kandror K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1998; 95: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) where these vesicles are as abundant as classical synaptic vesicles and can be separated from the latter by equilibrium density gradient centrifugations. The overall protein composition of these synaptic-like vesicles is very close to classical synaptic vesicles, with SV2, synaptotagmin, synaptophysin, and synaptobrevin being the major components in both pools (7Thoidis G. Pushkin A. Chen P. Vallega G. Leeman S. Fine R.E. Kandror K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1998; 95: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Several important differences have nevertheless been found in protein content in the two vesicular populations. First, synaptic-like vesicles have a much lower content of V-type H+-ATPase (proton pump) (7Thoidis G. Pushkin A. Chen P. Vallega G. Leeman S. Fine R.E. Kandror K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1998; 95: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); second, they specifically compartmentalize Glut3 (this study); finally, they have very high aminopeptidase activity that has been identified as aminopeptidase B (this study). Because this aminopeptidase is known to be targeted to the secretory pathway (8Balogh A. Cadel S. Foulon T. Picart R. DerGarabedian A. Rousselet A. Tougard C. Cohen P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 161-169PubMed Google Scholar), we believe that these synaptic-like vesicles represent a secretory compartment in neurons and PC12 cells. This is consistent with the fact that Glut3 is targeted to the secretory granules in platelets, another cell type with high Glut3 content (4Heijnen H.F.G. Oorschot V. Sixma J.J. Slot J.W. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 5Sorbara L.R. Davies-Hill T.M. Koehler-Stec E.M. Vannucci S.J. Horne M.K. Simpson I.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because Glut3 is also a predominant component of clathrin-coated vesicles in rat brain, we suggest that this protein may recycle between its intracellular compartment and the plasma membranevia an as yet uncharacterized pathway involving clathrin-coated vesicles. There are interesting parallels between Glut3-containing vesicles in brain and Glut4-containing vesicles in insulin-sensitive fat and skeletal muscle tissues. Both types of vesicles have similar size, sedimentation coefficient, and buoyant density in sucrose solutions (this study and Ref. 14Kandror K.V. Coderre L. Pushkin A.V. Pilch P.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Moreover, both incorporate aminopeptidases that, in addition to glucose transporters, serve as marker proteins for these vesicular compartments. The specific vesicle-associated aminopeptidases, however, are quite different; insulin-sensitive aminopeptidase, or IRAP, was found in Glut4-containing vesicles (15Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8017-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar,16Keller S.R. Scott H.M. Mastick C.C. Aebersold R. Lienhard G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23612-23618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and aminopeptidase B (8Balogh A. Cadel S. Foulon T. Picart R. DerGarabedian A. Rousselet A. Tougard C. Cohen P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 161-169PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cadel S. Foulon T. Viron A. Balogh A. Midol-Monnet S. Noel N. Cohen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2963-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) in Glut3-containing vesicles. An even more significant difference is that Glut4-containing vesicles represent a specialized endosomal compartment in adipocytes (18Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas Glut3-containing vesicles in brain are likely to be a regulated secretory compartment. In this regard, it will be interesting to determine whether Glut3- and aminopeptidase B-containing synaptic-like vesicles are relevant to the vesicular compartment identified by transfection of Glut4 into PC12 cells (19Herman G.A. Bonzelius F. Cieutat A.-M. Kelly R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12750-12754Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This may reveal interesting aspects of protein targeting into different specialized intracellular membrane compartments. Another important question has to do with the regulation of Glut3 translocation from intracellular secretory vesicles to the cell surface and its possible return to an intracellular pool, which presumably takes place via a clathrin-mediated mechanism. This problem is currently under investigation in our laboratory. We thank Dr. Dennis Brown for help with confocal microscopy."

Leinwand L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Each member has been shown to be responsive to a complex set of intrinsic and extrinsic signals that collectively regulate their expression in a defined developmental stage- and muscle fiber type-specific pattern. Within the MyHC gene family, the βMyHC is the one member whose regulated expression in both cardiac and skeletal muscle has been most extensively studied. Expression of the βMyHC gene has been detected in the ventricular myocardium and skeletal muscles comprising the hind limb of fetal mice, whereas in the adult, its expression is primarily restricted to skeletal muscles or muscle regions composed predominately of slow twitch type I fibers (2Lyons G.E. Ontell M. Cox R. Sassoon D. Buckingham M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar,3Lyons G.E. Schiaffino S. Sassoon D. Barton P. Buckingham M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2427-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In vitro investigations of the control of βMyHC gene transcription have led to the identification of a control region located within the proximal promoter (nucleotides −300 to −188 of the human βMyHC gene) region (4Flink R.L Edwards J.G.

Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22678-22688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This control region was found to be composed of three discrete DNA regulatory elements termed MCAT-like, C-rich and βe3, which are highly conserved in location and sequence across species (4Flink R.L Edwards J.G. Bahl J.J. Liew C.-C. Sole M. Morkin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9917-9924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Shimizu N. Dizon E. Zak R. Mol. Cell.

Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22678-22688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absolute requirement for these elements to obtain high levels of gene expression was demonstrated in transient transfection studies where the independent disruption of any of these conserved elements decreased and/or abolished muscle-specific expression of βMyHC reporter genes (4Flink R.L Edwards J.G.

Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22678-22688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Located just upstream from the βMyHC control region is a highly conserved negative regulatory element (βNRE; nucleotides −332 to −300) that represses transcription of βMyHC reporter genes and heterologous promoters in transient expression assays (4Flink R.L Edwards J.G. Bahl J.J. Liew C.-C. Sole M. Morkin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9917-9924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Edwards J.G. Bahl J.J. Flink I. Milavetz J. Goldman S. Morkin E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 504-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have provided evidence that two distinct proteins interact with this element: cellular nucleic acid-binding protein (CNBP) and the Y-box binding factor, YB-1 (9Flink I.L Morkin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6959-6965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Gore M.T. Sumbandam T. Umeda P.K. Circulation. 1993; 88 (abstr.): 1261Google Scholar). In co-transfection experiments, CNBPα, but not CNBPβ, was shown to repress βMyHC reporter gene expression in rat fetal heart cells. Although the regulatory effects of YB-1 binding at the βNRE have not been determined, existing evidence suggests that YB-1 plays a role in mediating tissue-specific gene expression in a variety of tissue types including striated muscle (11Matsumoto K. Wolffe A.P. Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 318-323Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 12Ruiz-Lozano P. de Leccea L. Buesa C. de la Osa P.P. LePage D. Gualberto A. Walsh K. Pons G.

While the βNRE has been shown to regulate βMyHC gene expression in primary cardiocytes (9Flink I.L Morkin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6959-6965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), its regulatory role in vivo has not been identified, nor has this element been shown to play a regulatory role in mediating βMyHC gene expression in skeletal muscle. A more complex picture of the regulatory mechanisms directing βMyHC gene expression has emerged from recent transgenic investigations. These investigations revealed that decreased muscle-specific βMyHC transgene expression was observed only when all three DNA regulatory elements comprising the βMyHC control region were simultaneously mutated (15Knotts S. Rindt H. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31275-31282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rindt H. Gulick J. Knotts S. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5332-5338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was also shown that additional sequences located upstream of nucleotide −600 are required for high levels of muscle-specific βMyHC transgene expression and that these element(s) can compensate for the loss of any one or two control region elements (15Knotts S. Rindt H. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31275-31282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rindt H. Gulick J. Knotts S. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5332-5338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, these in vivo findings indicate that complex combinatorial interactions between distal and proximal DNA regulatory elements are required for high levels of striated muscle-specific expression. An important and relatively unexplored area concerns the malleable nature of βMyHC gene expression in response to a broad spectrum of physiological perturbations including changes in the levels of circulating thyroid hormone, modified patterns of electrical stimulation, and altered mechanical work loads. We have focused our efforts on delineating DNA regulatory element(s) that direct βMyHC gene expression in response to diverse modes of neuromuscular activity such as mechanical overload (MOV) and non-weight-bearing (NWB) activity (17Tsika G.L. Wiedenman J.L. Gao L. McCarthy J.J. Sheriff-Carter K. Rivera-Rivera I.D. Tsika R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C690-C699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18McCarthy J.J. Fox A.M. Tsika G.L. Gao L. Tsika R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: R1552-R1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our transgenic deletion analysis revealed that 293 base pairs (bp) of proximal promoter region is minimally sufficient to confer MOV induction to a CAT reporter gene, while 600 bp of proximal promoter region is sufficient to direct NWB responsiveness (17Tsika G.L. Wiedenman J.L. Gao L. McCarthy J.J. Sheriff-Carter K. Rivera-Rivera I.D. Tsika R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C690-C699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18McCarthy J.J. Fox A.M. Tsika G.L. Gao L. Tsika R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: R1552-R1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of βMyHC expression in response to MOV and NWB is correlated with a specific fiber phenotype change, where under normal conditions βMyHC expression is primarily restricted to slow twitch type I fibers but can be induced in fast twitch type II fibers following MOV and decreased in slow twitch type I fibers by NWB activity. Given the associated fiber type shift with the antithetic nature of βMyHC expression in response to these two diverse perturbations, several queries arise. First, do MOV and NWB activity direct βMyHC gene transcription via the same or distinct cis-acting element(s)? Second, do MOV and/or NWB element(s) serve an independent or overlapping role in specifying fiber type-specific expression? Third, does the βNRE contribute to the decrease in βMyHC expression seen under NWB conditions in vivo? As an initial step toward resolving these critical regulatory mechanism(s), we have set out to delimit a βMyHC gene promoter region that is responsive to NWB activity by generating transgenic lines harboring transgenes composed of either 293 or 350 bp of the human βMyHC gene proximal promoter region (β293, β350) fused to the 5′-end of the CAT gene. Notable findings resulting from this transgenic study are that the DNA regulatory sequence(s) that mediate βMyHC gene expression in response to either MOV or NWB activity are segregated to different regions within the proximal promoter of the βMyHC gene and that a negative regulatory element (dβNRE-S) that interacts with two unidentified protein(s), may play an in vivo role in NWB regulation of βMyHC. Transgenic mice were generated by microinjection of purified transgene DNA into pronuclei of single cell fertilized embryos as described previously (19Tsika R.W. Exercise Sport Sci. Rev. 1994; 22: 361-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Transgene-positive mice (founders) were identified by Southern blot analysis. Subsequent offspring derived from mating the founders were screened for transgene incorporation using the polymerase chain reaction. In the present study, multiple independent transgenic lines representing transgenes β350 and β293 (Fig. 1) were studied, and all lines were maintained in a heterozygous state by continual outbreeding to nontransgenic FVB/n mice. The NWB and MOV procedures used in this study were approved by the Animal Care Committee for the University of Missouri-Columbia, and the NWB and MOV mice were housed in an AAALAC (Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International) accredited animal facility. All mice were provided with food and water ad libitum and were housed at room temperature (24 °C) with a 12-h light-dark cycle in either standard filter top cages (control and MOV mice) or cages designed for head-down tilt suspension (hind limb suspension), as described previously (18McCarthy J.J. Fox A.M. Tsika G.L. Gao L. Tsika R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: R1552-R1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adult β293 transgenic mice, 12 weeks of age, were randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1) a NWB group that used hind limb suspension to impose NWB conditions (NWB; n = 46); 2) a NWB control group that served as cage ambulatory controls for the NWB group (C, n = 46); 3) a MOV group where MOV was imposed on the fast twitch plantaris muscle bilaterally by surgically removing the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles (17Tsika G.L.

Physiol. 1995; 269: C665-C674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (MOV; n = 17); and 4) a MOV control group that represented a sham-operated control for the MOV group (C;n = 17). Mice were prepared for the NWB experiment by an inexpensive modification of the noninvasive tail traction procedure, as described previously (18McCarthy J.J. Fox A.M. Tsika G.L. Gao L. Tsika R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: R1552-R1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For MOV studies, mice weighing an average of 25.7 g (see Tables II and III) were anesthetized with 0.017 ml of 2.5% (w/v) avertin/g of body weight (17Tsika G.L. Wiedenman J.L. Gao L. McCarthy J.J. Sheriff-Carter K. Rivera-Rivera I.D. Tsika R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C690-C699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tsika R.W. Hauschka S.D. Gao L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C665-C674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following a 2-week NWB period and an 8-week MOV period, control (NWB-C, MOV-C) and experimental (NWB, MOV) animals were anesthetized and weighed, and control-soleus (CS), NWB-soleus (NWB-S), control-plantaris (CP), and MOV-plantaris (MOV-P) muscles were collected for further study. All muscles were trimmed clean of fat and connective tissue, weighed, and stored at −80 °C until assayed. Prior to the initiation of the NWB study, a 4-week time course analysis was undertaken to establish the time period over which the greatest decrease in mouse muscle mass, transgene expression (composed of 5600 bp of βMyHC 5′ promoter sequence upstream of the CAT gene (15Knotts S.

Our results indicated that the greatest magnitude of change for each of the aforementioned parameters occurred after 2 weeks of NWB activity; therefore, the present NWB study was conducted with a 2-week termination time point. 2J.

Physiol. 1995; 269: C665-C674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate phenol-chloroform method as described by Chomczynaski and Sacchi (22Chomczynaski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of RNA was judged by the ratio of the absorbances (260/280 nm). Due to the small size of mouse muscle, it was necessary to pool muscle from 3–5 mice (CS = 6–8 mg; NWB-S = 5–6 mg; CP = 16 mg; MOV-P = 30 mg). Six micrograms of total RNA from CS and NWB-S or 8 μg from CP and MOV-P muscles was denatured at 65 °C in a solution containing 5 μl of deionized formamide and 1 μl of 10× running buffer. The inclusion of ethidium bromide allowed visualization of the RNA samples. Total RNA was fractionated on a 1.5% (w/v) agarose, 2.2 mformaldehyde-containing gel, transferred to a nylon filter (Duralon, Stratagene) by capillary blotting, and immobilized on the membrane by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (UV Stratalinker, Stratagene). The specific cDNA probes used in this study were as follows: mouse-specific CNBP probe (23Kingsley P.D. Zinkin A.S. Silver L.S. Pendola F.L. Palis J. Dev. Growth Differ. 1996; 38: 697-706Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), rat-specific YB-1 (10Gore M.T. Sumbandam T. Umeda P.K. Circulation. 1993; 88 (abstr.): 1261Google Scholar), and human 18 S rRNA (24Erickson J.M Rushford C.L. Dorney D.J. Wilson G.N. Schmickel R.D. Gene (Amst.). 1981; 16: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For detection of CAT mRNA, aHindIII/BamHI fragment from pSVOCAT was used. All cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) using a random primer kit (Stratagene) to a specific activity of 7–8 × 108 cpm/μg of DNA. An oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the mouse βMyHC 3′-untranslated region was used to detect mouse βMyHC-specific transcripts (20Tsika R.W. Hauschka S.D. Gao L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C665-C674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was end-labeled to a specific activity of 6 × 108 cpm/ng of DNA with γ-32P (6000 Ci/mmol)-labeled ATP using a KinAse-It kit (Stratagene). Filters were washed twice in 2× sodium chloride/sodium citrate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS for 15 min at room temperature followed by two 30-min washes in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 60 °C. Filters were dried and exposed to x-ray film (XAR-5, Eastman Kodak Co.) overnight at −80 °C. Differences between intensities of signal in control and experimental lanes were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) and expressed as relative percentage difference of arbitrary units. All Northern blots were hybridized with an 18 S rRNA cDNA probe to verify that each lane contained equal (±5%) amounts of RNA and for the purpose of normalizing all RNA values. CAT assays were performed as described by Tsikaet al. (20Tsika R.W. Hauschka S.D. Gao L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C665-C674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Extracts were prepared from transgenic tissues using a glass tissue homogenizer to disrupt tissues in 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 5 mm EDTA. All muscle extracts were prepared from frozen tissue, and each n value represents pooled muscles from one mouse. The protein concentration of each extract was determined by the method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). Tissue extracts were heated at 65 °C for 10 min followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 ×g. Since each transgenic line exhibits inherently different transgene expression levels, it was necessary to use different amounts of tissue extract and variable incubation times so that the CAT enzyme activities could be determined within a linear range (30% conversion) as described previously (17Tsika G.L. Wiedenman J.L. Gao L. McCarthy J.J. Sheriff-Carter K. Rivera-Rivera I.D. Tsika R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C690-C699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tsika R.W. Hauschka S.D. Gao L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C665-C674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Direct comparisons between and within transgenic lines representing both control and experimental groups (CS, NWB-S, CP, and MOV-P) were facilitated by presenting the data as specific CAT activity (pmol/μg of protein/min). Nuclear extracts were isolated from adult rat CS and NWB-S muscle. The sequential isolation of myonuclei and nuclear extract protein was performed according to the protocol of Lichtstein et al. (25Lichtstein S.J. Wuarin J. Schibler U. Cell. 1987; 51: 963-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) with minor modifications as described by Mar et al. (26Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4271-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and Larkin et al. (27Larkin S.B. Farrance I.K.G. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3742-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All procedures were carried out on ice. All buffers contained 2 μg/ml of each protease inhibitor: aprotinin and leupeptin and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Eight grams of either CS or NWB-S muscle, harvested from adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (200 g), were minced in phosphate-buffered saline. Minced muscle tissue was incubated for two 15-min intervals in relaxation buffer 1 (100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 6.8), followed by two 10-min washes in RBII (50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 6.8). The muscle tissue was then washed with 100 ml of homogenization buffer A (0.3 msucrose, 60 mm KCl, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)), followed by homogenization in 300 ml of fresh homogenization buffer A. Muscle tissue was disrupted with an Omni homogenizer (20-mm saw-tooth generator) at 60% power for three 20-s pulses. Muscle homogenates were then centrifuged (1000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min) in a Beckman JA-25–50 rotor, and the pellets were solubilized in homogenization buffer B (0.3 m sucrose, 60 mmKCl, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmDTT) containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. The solubilized pellet was homogenized (7-mm saw-tooth generator) at 60% power for one 15-s pulse, followed by homogenization with a hand-held Teflon glass Dounce homogenizer. Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the homogenate to a final concentration of 27% (v/v), and the mixture was centrifuged at 27,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The nuclear pellet was solubilized in 10 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% (w/v) glycerol). Nuclei were lysed by dropwise addition of 3 mNH4SO4 (pH 7.9) to a final concentration of 0.4m, and the resulting extract was gently shaken for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate was ultracentrifuged at 126,000 ×g for 1 h using a Beckman Ti-70 rotor, and the supernatant was collected. Solid NH4SO4 (0.3 g/ml) was added slowly to the supernatant, and nuclear proteins were allowed to precipitate on ice for 30 min. Precipitated proteins were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 126,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in 500 μl of dialysis buffer (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT). The muscle nuclear protein extract was dialyzed twice for 1 h each time against dialysis buffer, and aliquots were quick frozen and stored at −80 °C. Once thawed, nuclear protein extracts were not refrozen for use. Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). All oligonucleotide probes used in this study are listed in TableI. The double-stranded βNRE oligonucleotide probe (nucleotides −332 to −300) was labeled by fill-in reaction using the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dCTP. Single-stranded βNRE oligonucleotide probes (antisense, sense, sense-proximal, and sense-distal) were end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and [γ-32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and gel-purified. Binding reactions were performed for 20 min at room temperature in a 25-μl total volume. The binding reactions contained binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 5% (w/v) glycerol), 20,000 cpm of labeled DNA probe, 1 μg of either CS or NWB-S nuclear extract, and 0.1 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as a nonspecific competitor. Specificity of DNA binding was assessed by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled homologous or heterologous competitor DNA to the binding reaction. In some binding reactions, either HeLa nuclear extract (250 ng) or partially purified recombinant rat YB-1 protein extract (100 ng) was used in place of soleus nuclear extracts. Following incubation, DNA-protein complexes were electrophoretically resolved from unbound oligonucleotide probe on a 5% (w/v) nondenaturing polyacrylamid"
https://openalex.org/W2042165079,"Metallocarboxypeptidase D (CPD) is a membrane-bound trans-Golgi network (TGN) protein. In AtT-20 cells, CPD is initially produced as a 170-kDa endoglycosidase H-sensitive glycoprotein. Within 30 min of chase, the CPD increases to 180 kDa and is resistant to endoglycosidase H as a result of carbohydrate maturation. CPD also undergoes an activation step required for binding to a substrate affinity resin. Blocking the protein exit from the endoplasmic reticulum inhibits the increase in molecular mass but not the step required for affinity column binding, suggesting that enzyme activation precedes carbohydrate maturation and that these reactions occur in distinct intracellular compartments. Only the higher molecular weight mature CPD enters nascent secretory vesicles, which bud from the TGN of permeabilized AtT-20 and GH3 cells. The budding efficiency of CPD into vesicles is 2–3-fold lower than that of endogenous proopiomelanocortin in AtT-20 cells or prolactin in GH3 cells. In contrast, the packaging of a truncated form of CPD, which lacks the cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain, was similar to that of proopiomelanocortin. Taken together, the results support the proposal that CPD functions in the TGN in the processing of proteins that transit the secretory pathway and that the C-terminal region plays a major role in TGN retention.

Many bioactive peptides are synthesized from larger proteins by proteolytic processing that occurs in different organelles. Several endoproteases, which cleave at basic amino acid containing sites, have been described: prohormone convertase-1 (PC1) 1The abbreviations used are: PC, prohormone convertase; CPE, carboxypeptidase E; CPD, carboxypeptidase D; TGN, trans-Golgi network; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PRL, prolactin; POMC, proopiomelanocortin; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone (also known as PC3), PC2, PC4, PACE4, PC5A and -B (also known as PC6A and -B), and PC7 (also known as PC8 and LPC) (1Smeekens S.P.

A. 1996; 93: 3388-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Following the endoprotease step, a carboxypeptidase is usually required to remove residual Lys and/or Arg residues from the C terminus of the peptide (7Fricker L.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 8Fricker L.D. Fricker L.D. Peptide Biosynthesis and Processing. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 199-230Google Scholar). In some cases, further modification results in a C-terminal amide residue; this reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (9Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Until recently, carboxypeptidase E (CPE, also known as carboxypeptidase H, enkephalin convertase, and E.C. 3.4.17.10) was thought to be the only carboxypeptidase involved in the generation of peptide hormones and neurotransmitters (7Fricker L.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 8Fricker L.D. Fricker L.D. Peptide Biosynthesis and Processing. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 199-230Google Scholar). However, studies onCpe fat /Cpe fat mice have suggested that another carboxypeptidase contributes to peptide processing in addition to CPE (10Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouille Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J. Paigen B.J. Leiter E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). TheCpe fat /Cpe fat mice have a point mutation in the coding region of the CPE gene, which inactivates the enzyme resulting in its degradation prior to secretion (10Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouille Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J. Paigen B.J. Leiter E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 11Varlamov O. Leiter E.H. Fricker L.D.

These mice have reduced levels of several peptide hormones and neurotransmitters and elevated levels of proteolytic-processing intermediates containing C-terminal basic residues (10Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouille Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J. Paigen B.J. Leiter E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 12Rovere C. Viale A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30619-30624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar); this finding is strong evidence that CPE plays a major role in peptide processing. However, fully processed peptides are present in moderate levels in Cpe fat /Cpe fatmice, raising the possibility that another carboxypeptidase contributes to peptide processing. Carboxypeptidase D (CPD) was discovered during a recent search for enzymes with carboxypeptidase-like enzymatic properties (14Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25007-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Both CPE and CPD have substantial activity at pH values in the 5–6 range (14Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25007-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the internal pH of the intracellular compartments where processing is thought to occur (15Russell J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9496-9507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Johnson R.G. Scarpa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2189-2191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the intracellular localization of CPE and CPD differ; CPE is predominantly in the secretory vesicles of the regulated pathway, whereas CPD is enriched in the TGN and immature secretory granules (17Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 877-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,18Eng F.J. Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The physical properties of the two enzymes are also different. CPE is a 50–56-kDa protein that is present both as a soluble and peripheral membrane-associated form, whereas CPD is a type I 180-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein (14Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25007-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Recently, rat (19Xin X. Varlamov O. Day R. Dong W. Bridgett M.M. Leiter E.H. Fricker L.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 897-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and human (20Tan F. Rehli M. Krause S.W. Skidgel R.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) CPD cDNAs have been sequenced and were found to be homologs of duck gp180, a protein that binds duck hepatitis B virus particles (21Kuroki K. Eng F. Ishikawa T. Turck C. Harada F. Ganem D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15022-15028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Duck gp180 and rat and human CPD contain three repeats of a 50-kDa CPE-like domain, followed by a transmembrane domain and a 58 residue cytosolic tail (19Xin X. Varlamov O. Day R. Dong W. Bridgett M.M. Leiter E.H. Fricker L.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 897-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Tan F. Rehli M. Krause S.W. Skidgel R.A. Biochem.

Several other enzymes in the secretory pathway are also membrane-bound proteins, such as furin, PC5B, and peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (22Hatsuzawa K. Hosaka M. Nakagawa T. Nagase M. Shoda A. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22075-22078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Nakagawa T. Murakami K. Nakayama K.

Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These membrane-bound proteins are located in the TGN, although they also cycle to the cell surface (25Molloy S.S. Thomas L. VanSlyke J.K. Stenberg P.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar,26Tausk F.A. Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2185-2196PubMed Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to examine the biosynthesis and sorting of endogenous CPD into nascent secretory vesicles in the AtT-20 and GH3 cell lines. These cells express CPD mRNA (19Xin X. Varlamov O. Day R. Dong W. Bridgett M.M. Leiter E.H. Fricker L.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 897-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and have been extensively used to study the biosynthesis and intracellular trafficking of peptide hormones and processing enzymes. The results of the pulse-chase analysis in the present study are consistent with the previous finding that CPD is present in the TGN and cycles from the cell surface back to the TGN (17Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 877-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in AtT-20 cells. In addition, the finding that newly synthesized CPD is able to enter nascent secretory vesicles that bud from the TGN, albeit at a reduced efficiency relative to endogenous prohormones and hormones, is further evidence that CPD functions in the TGN and immature secretory vesicles in the processing of peptides and proteins. Our results also demonstrate that the cytoplasmic tail and/or transmembrane domain of CPD play an essential role in retaining the enzyme in the TGN. Wild type AtT-20 cells in 60-mm plates were incubated for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine and then radiolabeled (pulsed) with [35S]Met for 15 min, washed 3 times with media, and chased for various times at 37 °C. In some experiments, the chase was performed in media containing brefeldin A (5 μg/ml), cycloheximide (100 μg/ml), or at 15 or 20 °C. Following the chase, the media were removed, and the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then frozen on dry ice after adding 0.5 ml of 10 mm NaAc buffer at pH 5.5. For the analysis of the active form of CPD, the cells were thawed and sonicated, and the buffer was adjusted to 1% Triton X-100 and 1m NaCl in 50 mm NaAc, pH 5.5. The homogenate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was subjected to purification on a 0.5-mlp-aminobenzoylarginine-Sepharose 6B affinity column as described (14Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25007-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 27Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28884-28889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cell medium was also analyzed on the affinity resin after first adjusting the pH to 5.5 with 50 mm NaAc. CPD was eluted from the affinity column using 2 ml of Tris buffer, pH 8, containing 50 mm NaCl, 25 mm Arg, and 0.01% Triton X-100. Aliquots of the affinity column eluate were analyzed on a 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, which was then treated with Fluoro-hance and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak). Quantitation of autoradiograms was performed using an image analysis system as described (28Klein R.S. Das B. Fricker L.D. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 2011-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All autoradiograms used for quantitation were in the linear range of the system. For the isolation of CPD and CPE by immunoprecipitation, aliquots of the extracts described above were used. In some experiments, cells were extracted directly with 2% SDS using the standard immunoprecipitation protocol (29Mitra A. Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19876-19881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed using polyclonal antisera against purified rat CPD, purified duck CPD (gp180), the C-terminal 57 residues of duck CPD, or the C-terminal 9 residues of rat CPE (11Varlamov O. Leiter E.H. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13981-13986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28884-28889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Antisera-bound CPD was isolated using protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma) as described (29Mitra A. Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19876-19881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CPD was recovered by boiling the protein A-Sepharose 4B pellet in polyacrylamide gel-loading buffer containing 1% SDS for 5 min, and the immunoprecipitated material was analyzed on denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels as described above. In some experiments, the immunoprecipitated material was incubated in the presence of N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs), endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs), or neuraminidase fromVibrio cholerae (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 16 h at 37 °C. Prior to incubation with the protease-free glycosidases, the samples were boiled to inactivate any contaminating proteases. Following digestion, the samples were analyzed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels as described above. The preparation of permeabilized cells by a swell-scrape method was described previously (30Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 31Ling W.L.W. Siddhanta A. Shields D. Methods (Orlando). 1998; 16: 141-149Google Scholar). Basically, cells were radiolabeled for 10 min with [35S]Met, chased for 120 min (or shorter times) at 20 °C, and incubated in cold hypotonic buffer (15 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) for 5 min. After swelling, the cells were scraped off the plate with a rubber policeman and resuspended in 90 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 1 mm MgCl2, as described (30Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 31Ling W.L.W. Siddhanta A. Shields D. Methods (Orlando). 1998; 16: 141-149Google Scholar). Cells used for these analyses included wild type GH3 cells, AtT-20 cells expressing gp180 (18Eng F.J. Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and AtT-20 cells expressing gp180ΔC-term, a truncated form of duck CPD that lacks the cytosolic tail and transmembrane region. 2Varlamov, O., Eng, F. J., Novikova, E. G., and Fricker, L. D. (1999) J. Biol. Chem., in press. The incubation conditions for these experiments consisted of approximately 5 × 105 permeabilized cells, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 125 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 200 μm GTP, 10 mmcreatinine phosphate, 160 μg/ml creatinine phosphate kinase (ATP-regenerating system), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml Trasylol. Incubation for 90 min at 37 °C under these conditions is sufficient to reconstitute both prohormone processing and nascent secretory vesicle release from the TGN (30Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,31Ling W.L.W. Siddhanta A. Shields D. Methods (Orlando). 1998; 16: 141-149Google Scholar). The assay for nascent secretory vesicle budding was based on quantitating the release of radiolabeled hormones into a 15,000 ×g supernatant following an in vitro incubation (31Ling W.L.W. Siddhanta A. Shields D. Methods (Orlando). 1998; 16: 141-149Google Scholar, 33Austin C.D. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Following the incubation, permeabilized cells were pelleted and lysed in detergent, and the lysates and supernatants containing nascent secretory vesicles were immunoprecipitated with antisera to either rat CPD, duck CPD (gp180), CPE, prolactin, or ACTH (a gift of Dr. Richard Mains, Johns Hopkins University) (this antiserum also recognizes proopiomelanocortin and intermediate processing forms of ACTH) as described (31Ling W.L.W. Siddhanta A. Shields D. Methods (Orlando). 1998; 16: 141-149Google Scholar). Immunoreactive material was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by fluorography. Band intensities were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics model 300A computing densitometer and Image Quant 3.3 software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The biosynthesis of CPD was investigated in AtT-20 cells using metabolic labeling with [35S]Met and two techniques to isolate the radiolabeled CPD, substrate affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation. After a 15-min pulse with radiolabel followed by purification of the CPD on a substrate affinity resin, a single 170-kDa form of CPD was detected (Fig. 1). During the 30 min chase period, the apparent molecular mass of the radiolabeled CPD increased to 180 kDa, and the amount of radiolabeled CPD recovered from the affinity column also increased severalfold (Fig.1). Quantitation of the results from four separate experiments showed a reproducible 3-fold increase in the amount of affinity-purified radiolabeled CPD upon early chase times (Fig.2). Following this increase, the level of radiolabeled CPD remained constant for several hours and then decreased (Figs. 1 and 2). After 20 h, the cellular level of radiolabeled CPD was approximately 30% of the peak value. No radiolabeled CPD was detected in the media for any of the time points investigated (Fig.1).Figure 2Quantitation of the pulse-chase analysis of CPD and CPE in AtT-20 cells upon purification by substrate affinity column. Quantitation was performed using exposures within the linear range of the film.

CP, carboxypeptidase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To compare the relative amount of CPE and CPD produced by the same cells, the affinity columns were first eluted with high pH buffer (to elute CPE) before eluting the CPD with Arg. Analysis of the CPE-containing fractions showed a major band of approximately 55 kDa (not shown). The intensity of this band was substantially greater than that of the radiolabeled CPD. Because the affinity columns appear to bind both proteins quantitatively, the AtT-20 cells synthesize approximately 50–100-fold more CPE than CPD, after adjustment for the number of Met residues in each protein. Quantitation of the radiolabeled CPE from four separate experiments showed a 35% decrease over the first hour followed by a slower decrease over the remainder of the chase period (Fig. 2). As previously reported (34Fricker L.D. Devi L. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1404-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), radiolabeled CPE was detected in the media after 1 h of chase and accumulated with increasing chase time (not shown). When the radiolabeled CPD in the pulse-chase extracts was isolated by immunoprecipitation, its apparent molecular mass increased from 170 to 180 kDa during the 1 h chase period, but no increase in the amount of radiolabeled protein was evident (Fig.3). Similar results were obtained when using antiserum raised against either the mature form of rat CPD (Fig.3) or against its C-terminal region (data not shown). No differences in gel mobility were detected in comparing the extraction procedures used for the affinity column procedure (Triton X-100 plus NaCl) with the procedure used for immunoprecipitation (SDS) (data not shown). Thus, the increase in the amount of radiolabeled CPD recovered from the affinity column with time presumably represents an activation step, possibly protein folding, that is required for binding to the substrate affinity resin. In contrast to the increase in radiolabeled CPD seen during short chase periods with the affinity purification method, the decrease in CPD levels upon long chase periods was comparable for both the affinity purification and immunoprecipitation, indicating that the reduction is because of loss of CPD protein and not because of less efficient binding to the affinity column (not shown). To investigate whether changes in glycosylation contributed to the increase in apparent molecular mass of CPD, affinity purified material was treated with glycosidases. N-Glycosidase F, which removes all N-linked sugars, reduced the size of the protein isolated immediately after the pulse (i.e. the 170-kDa form) to 147 kDa and the form after chase (i.e. the 180-kDa form) to 150 kDa (Fig. 3). Neuraminidase digestion, which removes terminal sialic acid, decreased the apparent molecular mass of the 180-kDa species to 175 kDa but had no effect on the migration of the 170-kDa form (Fig. 3). This finding indicates that only the 180-kDa form had reached the trans-Golgi (the site of sialyltransferase activity) during 1 h of chase. Endoglycosidase H reduced the apparent molecular mass of the 170-kDa species to 147 kDa but had no effect on the 180-kDa form (Fig. 3). Thus, the 170-kDa species is endoglycosidase H sensitive, although the 180-kDa form is endoglycosidase H resistant, suggesting that the smaller form is predominantly localized to the ER or cis-Golgi, whereas the larger species is present in the medial or trans-Golgi. To further study the biosynthesis of CPD, the pulse-chase was performed under several conditions that trap proteins in the ER followed by isolation using a substrate affinity resin (Fig.4). To test whether the increase in the amount of CPD recovered on the affinity resin was because of increased synthesis of CPD, cycloheximide was used. When cycloheximide was added to the chase medium to block further protein synthesis, the amount and size of CPD was identical to that isolated from control untreated cells (Figs. 4 and 5, X). Brefeldin A added during the chase prevented the increase in apparent molecular mass but not the amount of CPD recovered from the affinity resin (Figs.4 and 5, B). Similarly, when the chase was performed at 15 °C, the increase in size was prevented but not the amount of radiolabeled CPD bound to the affinity resin (Figs. 4 and 5,15). Incubation at 20 °C, which prevents the exit of vesicles from the trans-Golgi network (30Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 35Matlin K. Simons K. Cell. 1983; 34: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), partially blocked the size increase (Figs. 4 and 5, 20). Taken together, these results suggest that the activation step is an ER event because treatments that block the exit from the ER do not prevent the activation.Figure 5Quantitation of the effect of various conditions on the amount of [35S]Met-labeled CPD recovered from the affinity resin.

This involves pulse-labeling the cells with [35S]Met followed by a 2 h chase at 20 °C to trap the radiolabeled proteins in the TGN, followed by permeabilization of the cells and analysis of the proteins present in nascent secretory vesicles, which are released from the TGN during subsequent in vitro incubation at 37 °C (31Ling W.L.W. Siddhanta A. Shields D. Methods (Orlando). 1998; 16: 141-149Google Scholar). For these experiments, AtT-20 cells were used as well as the rat anterior pituitary GH3 cell line because preliminary data determined these cells have relatively high levels of CPD. In addition, permeabilized GH3 cells have been used extensively to investigate vesicle budding from the TGN (36Chen Y.G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D. Hammond S.M. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane (37Martin T.F. Walent J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10299-10308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In GH3 cells, newly synthesized CPD was approximately 170 kDa (Fig.6 A, lane 1). When the cells were chased for 2 h at 20 °C, the majority of the protein remained as the 170-kDa form, although a small amount was present as a 180-kDa protein (Fig. 6 A, lane 2). Only the larger form of CPD entered nascent secretory vesicles (Fig.6 A, lane 6). Release of the vesicles from the TGN and the packaging of the 180-kDa CPD was dependent on the presence of an energy-generating system (compare lanes 6 and8). When wild type AtT-20 cells were used, the level of endogenous CPD was not easily detected in the budded vesicles, and so a cell line overexpressing duck CPD (gp180) was used. In these cells, the processing of CPD from the 170 to the 180-kDa species was much more efficient than in GH3 cells, and only a small fraction of the enzyme remained 170 kDa following a 2 h chase at 20 °C (Fig. 6 B, lane 2). For both AtT-20 and GH3 cell lines, the relative amount of CPD that entered into the nascent secretory vesicles represented only a small fraction (12–14%) (Table I) of the total radiolabeled CPD. In contrast, the budding of nascent secretory vesicles containing prolactin (PRL) from the TGN of GH3cells or of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) from AtT-20 cells was significantly more efficient (36–41%) (Table I) and was similar to results previously obtained (30Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 31Ling W.L.W. Siddhanta A. Shields D. Methods (Orlando). 1998; 16: 141-149Google Scholar). As expected the budding of vesicles containing these prohormones was energy-dependent (30Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 38Wan L.

The low apparent budding efficiency of CPD into nascent secretory vesicles was not because of the intrinsic inefficiency of the permeabilized system, because vesicles containing soluble cargo polypeptides (PRL and POMC) were efficiently released from the TGN (Table I).Table IQuantitation of vesicle buddingCell lineSampleBuddingaVesicle budding efficiency was calculated from gels similar to those shown in Figs. 6 and 7 as the amount of immunoreactive material in the vesicle fraction divided by the total immunoreactive material ((S)/(P + S) × 100).

Here we have focused on one such protein, p83. We partially purified p83, obtained peptide sequence, and identified it as the intermediate chain of cytoplasmic dynein. During oocyte maturation, dynein intermediate chain became hyperphosphorylated at the time of germinal vesicle breakdown and remained hyperphosphorylated throughout the rest of meiosis and early embryogenesis. p150Glued, a subunit of dynactin that has been shown to bind to dynein intermediate chain, underwent similar changes in its phosphorylation. Both dynein intermediate chain and p150Glued also became hyperphosphorylated during M phase in XTC-2 cells and HeLa cells. Thus, two components of the dynein-dynactin complex undergo coordinated phosphorylation changes at two G2/M transitions (maturation in oocytes and mitosis in cells in culture) but remain constitutively in their M phase forms during early embryogenesis. Dynein intermediate chain and p150Glued phosphorylation may positively regulate mitotic processes, such as spindle assembly or orientation, or negatively regulate interphase processes such as minus-end-directed organelle trafficking.

Fully grown (stage VI) Xenopus oocytes are arrested in a G2-like state. Exposure to progesterone releases oocytes from this arrest and causes meiotic maturation. The maturing oocyte undergoes germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), 1The abbreviations used are: GVBD, germinal vesicle breakdown; dynein IC, cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; XTC-2, Xenopus tadpole cell line 2; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid forms a meiotic spindle, segregates its homologous chromosomes, completes the first meiotic division, enters meiosis 2, and then arrests in metaphase of meiosis 2.

Machleder E.M. Science. 1998; 280: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), ensuring that the oocyte's decision to carry out maturation is decisive and irrevocable. Relatively little is known about how the activation of MAPK and Cdc2 brings about the dramatic cell biological changes of maturation. Some of the relevant substrates of these kinases are undoubtedly involved in entry into mitosis as well; others must be specific for meiosis or maturation. Expression cloning studies have identified a number of proteins that become phosphorylated at the onset of mitosis (16Stukenberg P.T. Lustig K.D. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Curr.

Here we have approached the identification of meiotic phosphoproteins by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting, the strategy that implicated p42 MAPK in Xenopus oocyte maturation (19Jessus C. Rime H. Haccard O. Van Lint J. Goris J. Merlevede W. Ozon R. Development. 1991; 111: 813-820PubMed Google Scholar, 20Haccard O. Jessus C. Cayla X. Goris J. Merlevede W. Ozon R. Eur. J.

We looked for immunoreactive bands that increased in intensity during oocyte maturation (as does p42 MAPK), decreased in intensity (as does Cdc2), or changed in their electrophoretic mobility. This paper focuses on the first of these proteins, p83, a band that shifts up in its apparent molecular weight during oocyte maturation but does not change substantially in intensity. Through purification and peptide sequencing, we have identified p83 as a component of the minus-end-directed microtubule motor dynein, the cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain (dynein IC). We found that dynein IC comigrates with p83 and undergoes mobility shifts that exactly parallel those of p83; that the mobility shift of dynein IC is due to phosphorylation; and that dynein IC cross-reacts with various phosphotyrosine antisera but is phosphorylated mainly at serine in vivo. Dynein IC was found to undergo hyperphosphorylation just prior to germinal vesicle breakdown and to remain hyperphosphorylated throughout maturation and early embryogenesis. In addition, we examined the phosphorylation of the p150Glued subunit of dynactin, because of the physical and functional association between dynein and dynactin (23Allan V. Curr.

We found that p150Glued also becomes hyperphosphorylated during oocyte maturation and, like dynein IC, remains in a shifted form during early embryogenesis. Finally, we found that both dynein IC and p150Glued exhibit mobility shifts in nocodazole-treated XTC-2 cells and HeLa cells. These findings demonstrate that multiple components of the dynein/dynactin system undergo coordinated phosphorylation changes at the G2/M transitions of both meiosis and mitosis.

Cell. 1982; 30: 675-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). Immature stage VI oocytes were treated with progesterone (5 μg/ml) in modified Barth's saline containing Ca2+ and bovine serum albumin at room temperature for various lengths of time to induce maturation. GVBD was inferred from the appearance of a distinct white dot at the oocyte's animal pole. Groups of oocytes were quick-frozen on dry ice. Ten oocytes, eggs, or embryos were added to 100 μl of ice-cold extract buffer (250 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) containing 0.5 mm Na3VO4 and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by pipetting through a 200-μl pipette tip. Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min in a microcentrifuge with a right angle rotor. Samples of clarified cytoplasm were removed from the overlying lipid and underlying yolk protein. Cytoplasm was frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C. Concentrated cell-free Xenopus oocyte extracts were prepared essentially as described previously (29Huang C.-Y.F. Ferrell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2169-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cycling egg extracts were prepared as described (32Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). G2 phase oocyte lysates containing approximately 600 mg of protein were subjected to a 20–35% ammonium sulfate cut. The precipitate was resuspended in 60 ml of buffer A (50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 20 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble proteins. The supernatant was loaded on an S-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed extensively with buffer A, and proteins were eluted with buffer B (50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 1 mNaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). The eluent was diluted with a 10× volume of buffer C (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) and then spun at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. The filtrate was applied to a 5-ml FPLC HiTrap Blue column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer D (buffer C plus 10 mm NaCl). Protein was eluted with a 35-ml linear gradient from buffer C to buffer E (buffer C plus 1.5 m NaCl and 2% ethylene glycol). Fractions were collected and assayed for p83 by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting. The 83-kDa doublet bands were excised from the SDS-PAGE and sent to the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory (Yale University) for sequencing. For in vivo 32P labeling, groups of 50 oocytes were placed in a 12-well plate containing 2 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate/ml in modified Barth's saline containing Ca2+ and bovine serum albumin as described above and incubated with or without progesterone (5 μg/ml). Once the progesterone-treated oocytes reached GVBD, both groups of oocytes were transferred to nonradioactive modified Barth's saline solution, washed four times, and frozen on dry ice. Lysates were prepared as described above. Samples were separated on 7.5 or 10% low-bis polyacrylamide SDS gels (acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio 100:1) and transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore Corp.) blotting membranes. Proteins were detected with polyclonal antiphosphotyrosine antiserum (21Ferrell Jr., J.E. Wu M. Gerhart J.C. Martin G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1965-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), dynein IC monoclonal antibody (clone 70.1; Sigma), or p150Glued monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories), followed by 125I-protein A for phosphotyrosine detection or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) for dynein IC and p150Glued detection. Oocyte lysates were diluted with 1 volume of IP buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 15 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm NaF, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 60 mm 2-glycerolphosphate, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). The solution was incubated with dynein IC antibody 70.1 or p150Glued antiserum at 4 °C for 2–4 h. Anti-mouse IgM agarose (for dynein IC) (Sigma) or anti-mouse IgG agarose (for p150Glued) (Sigma) was added and incubated for another 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer lacking NaF, Na3VO4, and 2-glycerolphosphate. The resulting pellets were resuspended either in SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE analysis or λ-phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35, and 2 mmMnCl2). Dynein IC or p150Glued immunoprecipitates were incubated with 400 units of λ-phosphatase (New England BioLabs) in λ-phosphatase buffer at 30 °C for 30 min. This was followed by adding an additional 400 units of λ-phosphatase for a further 60 min at 30 °C. 32P-Labeled lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with dynein or p150Glued antibodies followed by SDS-PAGE and transfer to Immobilon P membranes as described above. Dynein IC and p150Glued bands were excised and subjected to partial acid hydrolysis (33Kamps M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The hydrolysates were mixed with phosphoamino acid standards and subjected to two-dimensional (pH 1.9 followed by pH 3.5) electrophoresis on thin layer cellulose plates (34Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). XTC-2 cells were grown in 70% L-15 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were arrested in interphase (S phase) by double thymidine block. Cells were treated with 2 mmthymidine for 24 h, grown in regular medium for 12 h, and then grown again for 24 h in medium containing 2 mmthymidine. Cells were arrested in M phase by release from double thymidine block followed by treatment with nocodazole (100 ng/ml) for 12–16 h. Mitotic cells were recovered by gentle shake off. Mitotic index was determined by staining an aliquot of the cells with Hoechst 33342 dye followed by epifluorescence microscopy. Samples for immunoblotting were prepared by suspending washed pelleted cells in phosphate-buffered saline and lysing with SDS sample buffer. Bacterially expressed wild-type malE-Mos protein was purified as described (12Yew N. Mellini M.L. Vande Woude G.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. We used antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting to search for proteins that undergo phosphorylation changes during Xenopus oocyte maturation, with the aim of identifying new regulators or effectors of meiosis. In agreement with previous reports (19Jessus C. Rime H. Haccard O. Van Lint J. Goris J. Merlevede W. Ozon R. Development. 1991; 111: 813-820PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ferrell Jr., J.E. Wu M.

Biol. 1991; 11: 2517-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), the most prominent antiphosphotyrosine-reactive bands were a ∼42-kDa band corresponding to p42 MAP kinase, which appeared just prior to GVBD, and a ∼33-kDa band corresponding to Cdc2, which disappeared just prior to GVBD (Fig.1 A). In addition, we identified five other bands recognized by at least one antiphosphotyrosine antiserum that changed in intensity or mobility during maturation, with apparent molecular masses of 83, 95, 100, 116, and 140 kDa (Fig. 1 A and data not shown). Early attempts to identify these proteins by testing plausible candidates proved to be unsuccessful. We therefore purified each of the proteins fromXenopus oocytes or eggs, using antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting as an assay. Here we shall focus on p83, which migrated as a doublet in G2 phase with the upper band becoming more prominent during maturation (Fig. 1 A). Both p83 bands were recognized by several antiphosphotyrosine antisera (PY20, 4G10, and the polyclonal serum used in the blots shown herein), and their recognition was blocked by phenylphosphate (40 mm) or phosphotyrosine (1 mm) but not by phosphothreonine (1 mm) or phosphoserine (1 mm) (data not shown). Both p83 bands were detected in G2 phase Xenopusextracts and shifted to the upper band in extracts treated with okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor, and Mos, an activator of the MAP kinase cascade (Fig. 1 B). p83 also shifted in response to added active Cdc2-cyclin B (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Initial attempts to immunopurify p83 with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies were unsuccessful; we therefore used classical protein purification techniques. G2 phase oocyte lysates were subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation (taking a 20–35% cut) followed by S-Sepharose cation exchange chromatography and HiTrap Blue dye affinity chromatography. The HiTrap Blue column profile is shown in Fig. 2. p83 eluted as a doublet in fractions 31–35 as judged by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig. 2 C). Corresponding bands were seen by Coomassie staining (Fig. 2 B). To address whether the two p83 bands were derived from the same protein, both bands were cut out from SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subjected to tryptic digestion and reversed phase microbore HPLC analysis. The patterns of tryptic peptides from the two bands were nearly identical (Fig. 3 A). All of the major peaks were present in both samples, indicating that these two proteins were probably closely related. To further test this conclusion, four peptide peaks from each of the samples were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The masses of the upper and lower band peptides were very similar (Fig. 3 B), again supporting the idea that the upper and lower p83 bands were derived from a single protein. These findings also suggested that both of the two p83 bands were essentially pure (or, possibly, that both bands were contaminated by the same non-p83 protein). The MALDI-MS analysis was used to identify peptide peaks that would be suitable for gas phase microsequencing. One such peak (peak 5, from the p83 lower band) was sequenced and found to comprise VTQVDFAPR. This peptide was similar (8 of 9 identities) to a predicted tryptic peptide from rat cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain (dynein IC) (Fig.3 C). The predicted molecular mass of rat dynein IC is 74 kDa (31Paschal B.M. Mikami A. Pfister K.K. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1133-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), close to the apparent molecular weight of Xenopus p83. We therefore hypothesized that p83 was Xenopus dynein IC. To test this hypothesis, we made use of a monoclonal dynein IC antibody that cross-reacts with the Xenopus protein. G2phase oocyte extracts were obtained and treated with buffer, Mos, okadaic acid, or Cdc2-cyclin B. Aliquots of the extracts were subjected to immunoblotting with the dynein IC antibody 70.1. Dynein IC was found to migrate as a closely spaced 83-kDa doublet in G2 phase extracts (Fig. 4 A), and dynein IC shifted to a single upper band in response to Mos, okadaic acid, or Cdc2-cyclin B (Fig. 4 A). Thus, dynein IC (Fig.4 A) and p83 (Fig. 1 B) migrate similarly and respond similarly to various stimuli. Immunoprecipitated dynein IC was recognized on immunoblots by antiphosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig.4 B). Taken together, the common properties of the two proteins identify p83 as dynein IC. Next, we addressed whether the upper dynein IC band represented a hyperphosphorylated form of the lower band. Dynein IC was immunoprecipitated from G2 and M phase lysates. Immunoprecipitates were then treated with extract buffer, λ-phosphatase (a dual specificity phosphatase), or λ-phosphatase plus vanadate (an inhibitor of λ-phosphatase), and the products were subjected to electrophoresis and dynein IC immunoblotting. G2 phase dynein IC migrated as a doublet (Fig.5 A, lane 1), and the upper band was eliminated by treatment with λ-phosphatase (lane 2) but not by treatment with λ-phosphatase plus vanadate (lane 3). Dynein IC isolated from M phase lysates migrated as a single upper band (lane 4) and was shifted to a lower band by treatment with λ-phosphatase (lane 5) but not by treatment with λ-phosphatase plus vanadate (lane 6). These findings establish the dynein IC upper band to be a hyperphosphorylated form of the lower band. The fact that both the upper and lower bands of dynein IC were recognized by antiphosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 1) suggested that both forms were phosphorylated at tyrosine. However, previous phosphoamino acid analysis of axonemal dynein reportedly yielded only phosphoserine (35Dillman III, J.F. Pfister K.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1671-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Consequently, we examined further whether dynein IC is phosphorylated on tyrosine. Dynein IC was labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in vivo, subjected to immunoprecipitation, and transferred to a blotting membrane. Radiolabel was found to be incorporated into G2 phase dynein IC (both bands) and M phase dynein IC, and the overall level of labeling of G2 and M phase dynein IC was similar (data not shown). The dynein IC bands were excised from the blot and subjected to partial acid hydrolysis and thin layer electrophoresis. The two G2 phase dynein IC bands and the M phase dynein IC band all yielded primarily phosphoserine (Fig.5 B), consistent with a previous report (35Dillman III, J.F. Pfister K.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1671-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and contrary to the antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting results (Figs. 1, 2, and 4), no phosphotyrosine was detected. This finding suggests that the recognition of dynein IC by antiphosphotyrosine antibodies might have been spurious. We also immunoprecipitated dynein IC from M phase oocytes and treated the immunoprecipitates with λ-phosphatase. The λ-phosphatase caused dynein IC to shift completely to the lower band without decreasing its antiphosphotyrosine immunoreactivity (Fig.5 C). The simplest interpretation of these data is that the antiphosphotyrosine antibodies recognize dynein IC in a phosphorylation state-independent fashion. To determine whether dynein IC hyperphosphorylation was specific to meiosis or occurred in other M phases, we examined in detail the timing of dynein IC hyperphosphorylation during maturation, mitosis in cycling extracts, and the mitotic cycles of fertilized eggs and early embryos. Dynein IC shifted to its hyperphosphorylated form just prior to GVBD (Fig.6 A), at about the time when Cdc2 and p42 MAPK become activated (data not shown). Dynein IC remained hyperphosphorylated throughout the rest of meiosis 1 and into meiosis 2. There was no detectable decrease in dynein IC phosphorylation during the period before meiosis 2 when Cdc2 activity drops (Fig.6 A and data not shown; see also Ref. (62Furuno N. Nishizawa M. Okazaki K. Tanaka H. Iwashita J. Nakajo N. Ogawa Y. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Next, we assessed dynein IC phosphorylation in cycling egg extracts, with cell cycle progression assessed by observation of nuclei formed from added sperm chromatin. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the extracts were initially in interphase and then entered mitosis at about 60 min and exited mitosis at about 80 min. During all of these cell cycle phases, dynein IC remained in its hyperphosphorylated form (Fig.6 B). Finally, we examined dynein IC phosphorylation during the completion of meiosis 2 and the first three mitotic cycles of fertilized eggs. Once again, dynein IC remained constitutively in its hyperphosphorylated form (Fig. 6 C). Dynein IC was also found to be hyperphosphorylated in stage X (gastrula) embryos. Taken together, these results show that dynein IC goes from partially hyperphosphorylated to fully hyperphosphorylated at the G2/meiosis 1 transition during oocyte maturation, and then remains constitutively hyperphosphorylated throughout the remainder of meiosis, mitosis, and early embryogenesis. Dynein IC physically interacts with the p150Glued component of dynactin complex (27Karki S. Holzbaur E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28806-28811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 28Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Since dynein IC underwent cell cycle-dependent hyperphosphorylation during oocyte maturation, we set out to determine whether p150Glued did as well. As shown in Fig.8 A, p150Glued progressively shifted from a lower apparent molecular weight band to a higher one during oocyte maturation. The mobility shift was due to hyperphosphorylation, since λ-phosphatase treatment caused M phase p150Glued to shift from the higher band to the lower one (Fig.7 A). In vivo 32P labeling and phosphoamino acid analysis of p150Glued showed that G2 phase p150Glued was essentially nonphosphorylated, and M phase p150Glued was phosphorylated predominantly at serine (Fig.7 B). Like dynein IC, p150Gluedhyperphosphorylation persisted throughout meiosis and early embryogenesis (Fig. 8, A,B, and D), and p150Glued became hyperphosphorylated in Mos-, okadaic acid-, and Cdc2-cyclin B-treated G2 phase oocyte extracts (although less rapidly and less completely than did dynein IC; Fig. 8 C versusFig. 4 A). Okadaic acid also caused p150Glued to shift to a third more highly shifted band that we have not detected during the normal cell cycles of oocytes and eggs (Fig.8 C).Figure 7Phosphorylation of p150Glued in G2 and M phase oocytes. A, effect of phosphatase treatment on p150Glued electrophoretic mobility. G2 or M phase lysates were immunoprecipitated with p150Glued antiserum. The immunoprecipitates were treated with extract buffer (lanes 1 and4), λ-phosphatase (lanes 2 and5), or λ-phosphatase plus Na3VO4(lanes 3 and 6). Samples were then analyzed by the SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with p150Glued antiserum. B, phosphoamino acid analysis of in vivo labeled p150Glued. Stage VI oocytes, treated with or without progesterone, were metabolically labeled in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate. Labeled oocytes were lysed and immunoprecipitated with p150Glued antiserum. Two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analyses of 32P-dynein intermediate chain immunoprecipitates from G2 and M phases are shown. The positions of nonradioactive phosphoamino acid standards are shown on the right. S, phosphoserine; T, phosphothreonine; Y, phosphotyrosine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Finally, we assessed whether dynein IC and p150Glued were hypophosphorylated in interphase (as was the case for oocytes) or hyperphosphorylated in interphase (as was the case for early embryos) in two somatic cell lines, Xenopustadpole XTC-2 cells and human HeLa cells, and whether there was any change in their phosphorylation when the cells entered mitosis. Interphase cells were obtained after double thymidine block; mitotic cells were obtained by releasing the double-thymidine blocked cells, arresting them in M phase by nocodazole treatment, and harvesting the mitotic cells by gentle shake off. This treatment yielded approximately 8"

Recently we reported on a class of hydroxamic acid based HPCs of which suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA; TableI) is the prototype.

Thus these agents have been recognized as potentially useful in the treatment of cancer, and are currently being studied at the National Cancer Institute.Table IPhotoaffinity labeling reagent is a structural analog of the parent compound SAHA Open table in a new tab In MEL cells, a model system we have used to study these agents, SAHA exerts its effects on the cell cycle. Shortly after exposure to SAHA, a transient prolongation of the initial G1 phase of the cell cycle is observed, and modulation in expression of a number of proteins involved in regulating cell cycle progression occurs (3Marks P.A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Int. J. Hematol. 1996; 63: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Over the next 48 h of culture with SAHA, there is progressive recruitment of most of the cells to differentiate, accompanied by accumulation of both total and underphosphorylated retinoblastoma gene product (pRB), the onset of globin synthesis, and permanent G1 arrest. Extensive structure-activity studies have shown that to achieve high potency, SAHA-like HPCs must meet strict structural requirements. The hydroxamic acid is crucial for achieving micromolar activity (SAHA; Table I). The optimal spacer length spanning the two polar sites is six methylenes, and only certain substitutions are tolerated on the benzene ring. These structural requirements suggest a specific binding interaction with a cellular target, rather than a nonspecific interaction. Photoaffinity labeling is widely used for investigation of receptor-ligand interactions (11Bayley H. Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 12. Elsevier, New York1983Google Scholar). We probed for the cellular target(s) of SAHA-like HPCs by designing a photoaffinity labeling reagent ([3H]498; Table I )structurally based on SAHA. Photoaffinity labeling in cell free extracts has identified a 32-kDa protein (p32), which was subsequently identified by mass spectrometry as the 40 S ribosomal protein S3. We show that S3 can be specifically labeled in bacterial lysates. Our results are consistent with S3 being a target of the SAHA-like HPCs. Carbonyl diimidazole (1.12 mmol) was added at 0 °C to a 50-ml round-bottomed flask containing 15 ml of dry THF and 1.11 mmol of suberic acid monomethyl ester. After stirring at 0 °C for 30 min, then at room temperature for 2 h, 1.13 mmol of 2,6-diiodo-4-aminoaniline 3 in 20 ml of THF were added dropwise through an addition funnel and the reaction was stirred at room temperature overnight. Then the THF was evaporated in vacuo and the residue was partitioned between CHCl3/H2O. The organic layer was evaporated, and the product was purified by silica gel chromatography (5% MeOH/CHCl3), to yield 0.337 g (57%) of 4.1H NMR: δ 1.2 (m, 4H), 1.5 (m, 4H), 1.5 (m, 2H), 2.3 (t, 2H), 2.3 (t, 2H), 3.6 (s, 3H), 4.84 (s, 2H), 7.9 (s, 2H), 9.6 (s, 1H). A solution of 0.62 mmol of 4 and 3.17 mmol of LiOH·H2O in 30 ml of 3:1 MeOH/H2O was heated to 60 °C, until TLC showed no presence of the starting material. The MeOH was removed in vacuo, and the aqueous residue was diluted, filtered, and acidified to pH 5 with 1 m HCl. The resulting precipitate was filtered and recrystallized from MeOH to afford 0.2655 g (82.7%) of 5. 1H NMR: δ 1.2–1.3 (m, 4H), 1.4–1.6 (m, 4H), 2.2 (m, 4H), 4.8 (s, 2H), 7.9 (s, 2H), 9.6 (s, 1H), 12.0 (s, 1H). A solution of 0.616 mmol of carbonyl diimidazole in 10 ml of THF was added to a solution of 0.385 mmol of 5in 20 ml of THF, and the reaction was stirred overnight at room temperature. Then, 0.914 mmol of H2NO-TBDPS were added, and the reaction was stirred at room temperature overnight. The THF was removed, and the reaction mixture was purified over silica gel (10% MeOH/CHCl3), then by preparative TLC, using the same solvent mixture. The product was washed with ether to afford 0.202 g (53%) of 6. 1H NMR: δ 1.1 (s, 9H), 1.0–1.2 (m, 4H), 1.2–1.4 (m, 2H), 1.4–1.5 (m 2H), 1.9(t, 2H), 2.2 (t, 2H), 4.8 (s, 2H), 7.3–7.4 (m, 6H), 7.6–7.7 (m, 4H), 7.9 (s, 2H), 9.8 (s, 1H), 10.6 (s, 1H). A solution of 77 mg of 6 in 15 ml of THF was chilled to 0 °C, and 0.2 ml of a 25% solution of tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride in THF were injected. The solution was stirred for 5 h, the first 10 min at 0 °C, then at room temperature. Then 6 ml of H2O/EtOAc (1:1) were added, and the THF was removedin vacuo. The solid in the organic layer was filtered, washed with ether and dried. This afforded 49.5 mg (97%) of7. 1 H NMR: δ 1.2–1.3 (m, 4H), 1.4–1.6 (m, 2H), 1.9 (t, 2H), 2.2 (t, 2H), 4.8 (s, 2H), 7.9 (s, 2H), 8.6 (s, 1H), 9.6 (s, 1H), 10.4 (s, 1H). The following was performed by the NEN Life Science Products custom tritium labeling service. A suspension of 4 mg of Pd-C (10% Pd) in 3 ml of methanol was mixed with 10 mg of Na2CO3 in H2O, cooled down over an ice/salt bath, and flushed with 3H2 gas (1 atm). Then, a prechilled 10-mg solution of 7 in MeOH was injected. The tritiation was carried out for 2–3 h. Then, the catalyst was filtered and the solvent was removed by distillation. The product (0.0188 mmol) had a specific activity of 40.42 Ci/mmol. 300 mCi were dissolved in MeOH (0.00742 mmol; ∼2 mg) and used in the subsequent step without further purification. Compound 8a was synthesized by catalytic hydrogenation of 7, using the above procedure. A solution of 18.8 mg of8a in 7 ml of MeOH was cooled to 0 °C over an ice bath. A chilled solution of 0.00742 mmol of radioactive 8 (300 mCi) in 4 ml of MeOH was added, followed by a solution of 0.1 ml of HCl in 1 ml of H2O. Then a solution of 0.14 mmol of NaNO2 in 0.5 ml of H2O was added to the reaction mixture over a 5-min period, and the reaction was stirred for 45 min at 0 °C, until a positive result to I2/starch paper was obtained. Sulfamic acid (0.093 mmol) was added, and the reaction was stirred for 15 min. A solution of 0.145 mmol of NaN3 in 0.2 ml of H2O was injected, and the reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature. After 15 min, 2 ml of EtOAc were added and the reaction mixture was concentrated by rotary evaporation. The residue was partitioned between 10 ml of 1:1 EtOAc/H2O, and the EtOAc layer was evaporated to dryness, to afford 11.6 mg (50%) of [ 3 H]498(specific activity 4 Ci/mmol). Compound 498 was synthesized from8a using the above procedure for the synthesis of[ 3 H]498, without the addition of8. MEL DS19/Sc9 cells, derived from 745A cells, were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cultures were initiated at a cell density of 1 × 105 cells/ml, and all experiments were performed with cells in logarithmic growth phase. Induction of differentiation, cell density, and benzidine reactivity were determined as described (12Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, London1994: 213-217Google Scholar). An aliquot of 1.6 × 107 MEL cells was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 50 μg/ml PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) at 0 °C for 30 min. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm (Beckman 5402 microcentrifuge) for 15 min. The supernatant was stored at −80 °C and used as whole cell extracts. Cell fractionation was performed according to the method previously described by van't Hof et al. (13van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, 2 × 108 MEL cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mmMgCl2) at 0 °C for 15 min, then Dounce homogenized (1 stroke). After the addition of 200 μl of 1.25 m sucrose and 2 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, the mixture was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (S1) was removed. The pellet (P1) was resuspended in 1 ml of a mixture of 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The combined S1 supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C (SS-34 rotor). The supernatant (S10) was centrifuged for 45 min at 100,000 ×g in a Beckman 70.1 Ti. The pellets (P10 and P100) were suspended in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The supernatant (S100) was used as the cytosolic extracts. Cell preparations were incubated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with or without nonradioactive 498 for 1 h at 4 °C. [ 3 H]498 was added to the final indicated concentration with the final protein concentration at 2 mg/ml. The samples were incubated for an additional 2.5 h, followed by 20 min of UV irradiation at 4 °C (Rayonet photochemical reactor lamp, Southern New England Ultraviolet Co., maximum light intensity at 253.7 nm). The UV irradiation experiments were carried out by maintaining the distance of 5 cm between the sample and light source. After irradiation, the samples were subjected to protein purification or solubilized in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were normalized for protein unless otherwise stated. Gels were enhanced (EN3HANCE, NEN Life Science Products), dried, and mounted on x-ray film for fluorography. For Triton X-100 extraction, P100 fractions were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with Csk buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.3 m sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF) at a final protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. For Zwittergent 3-16 extractions, Triton X-100-resistant fractions (PTx) were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% Zwittergent 3-16, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF) at a final protein concentration of 0.5–1 mg/ml. The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g in a Beckman TL-100 desktop ultracentrifuge (TLA 100.2 rotor) for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatants were removed. For Triton X-100 extraction, PTx fractions were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for further analysis, or solubilized in SDS sample buffer. For Zwittergent 3-16 extraction, the supernatants (STx+zw) were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed twice with ice-cold ether, and solubilized in SDS sample buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above. For mass spectrometric analysis, after electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and stained with Amido Black. The 32-kDa band was excised from the nitrocellulose blot and processed for internal sequence analysis as described (14Lui M. Tempst P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 241: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Lacomis L. Grewal A. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Tempst P. J. Chromatogr. 1998; 862: 167-181Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, in situ digestion was done using 0.1 μg of trypsin (modified sequencing grade; Promega, Madison, WI) in 10 μl of 100 mm NH4HCO3 (supplemented with 0.5% Zwittergent 3-16) for 2 h at 37 °C. The resulting peptide mixture was then loaded onto a 2-μl bed volume of Poros 50 R2 (PerSeptive, Framingham, MA) reversed-phase beads (sized to be between 40 and 60 μm, and slurry packed into an Eppendorf gel-loading tip), washed with 20 μl of 5% MeCN, 0.1% formic acid, and stepwise eluted in 4 μl of 16% (and then with 4 μl of 30%) MeCN, 0.1% formic acid; the two resulting fractions are designated “16% pool” and “30% pool.” Each peptide pool was analyzed twice by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS), in the presence and absence of peptide calibrants (15Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Lacomis L. Grewal A. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Tempst P. J. Chromatogr. 1998; 862: 167-181Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Aliquots (0.5 μl) were deposited on the probe surface, mixed with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution (MALDI-Quality; Bruker-Daltonics, Billerica, MA) on the plate, and allowed to dry at room temperature; calibrants were diluted from concentrated stocks and mixed to yield 12.5 fmol of each per 0.2-μl volume of the same solvent prior to mixing with the analytes. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired on a REFLEX III (Bruker-Franzen, Bremen, Germany) instrument equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser, a gridless pulsed-extraction ion source, and a 2-GHz digitizer. The instrument was operated in reflector mode; 25-kV ion acceleration, 26.25-kV reflector, and −1.4-kV multiplier voltages were used. Ion extraction was done 200 ns after each laser irradiance by pulsing down the source extraction lens to 17.7 kV from its initial 25-kV level to give appropriate time-lag focus conditions at the detector. Spectra were obtained by averaging multiple signals; laser irradiance and number of acquisitions (typically 100–150) were operator-adjusted to yield maximal peak deflections, derived from the digitizer as TOF data and displayed in real time as mass spectra using a SPARC station 5 (Sun Microsystems, Mountain View, CA). After recalibration with internal standards, monoisotopic masses were assigned for all prominent peaks, and a peptide mass list generated. Electrospray ionization (ESI) MS was done on an API 300 triple quadrupole instrument (PE-SCIEX; Thornhill, Canada), modified with an injection adaptable fineionization source (JaFIS) as described (16Geromanos S. Philip J. Freckleton G. Tempst P. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 12: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Needle voltage ranged from 600 to 1350 V depending on the application. The voltages for the orifice and the curtain plate were set at 5 and 350, respectively. Q1 scans were collected using a 0.5-atomic mass unit step size, and a 3-ms dwell time over a mass range from 400 to 1400 atomic mass units; scans were averaged for statistical analysis, and Q1 resolution was set such that the charge state of singly, doubly, and triply charged ions could be ascertained. For operation in the MS/MS mode, Q1 was set to transmit the complete isotopic envelope of the parent. All spectra were averaged with a 0.5-Da step size and a 3-ms dwell time for 5 min over the mass range of the singly chargedm/z. Q3 resolution was set such that the charge state of the fragment ions could be distinguished. Collision energies, as well as collision assisted dissociation gas pressures, were optimized individually for each peptide as to obtain the best MS/MS spectra. Selected, “major” mass values (combined from the 16% and 30% peptide pools, but restricted to 900 atomic mass units ≤m/z ≤ 3,000 atomic mass units) from the MALDI-TOF experiments were arbitrarily taken to search a protein non-redundant data base (NRDB; European Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton, UK) using the PeptideSearch (17Mann M. Højrup P. Roepstorff P. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 22: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) algorithm. A molecular mass range of up to 300 kDa was covered, with a mass accuracy restriction of 30 ppm or better, and a maximum of one missed cleavage site allowed per peptide. After a tentative identification was made, as many as possible of the experimental masses were fitted to the listed sequence (monoisotopic mass values), allowing for maximal 0.1-Da discrepancy. MS/MS spectra from the ESI triple quadrupole analyses were inspected for uninterrupted y“ ion series using the “find higher Aas” routine of the BioToolbox (PE-SCIEX) software; the resultant information (2–6-amino acid partial sequence, plus corresponding precursor and fragment ion masses) was semi-automatically transferred, by way of a custom AppleScript (Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA), to the SequenceTag (18Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar) program and used as a search string, with a 2-Da mass error restriction. In case less than three y” ions could be tagged, this limited information was taken (together with precursor ion mass) to search the data base using the PepFrag protein identification program from the PROWL resource (19Fenyö D. Zhang W. Chait B. Beavis R.C. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 721A-726ACrossref Google Scholar). 2The PepFrag protein identification program from the PROWL resource is available via the World Wide Web (http://prowl. rockefeller.edu/PROWL/pepfragch.html). Any protein identification thus obtained was verified by comparing the computer-generated fragment ion series of the predicted tryptic peptide with the experimental MS/MS data; this also allowed the discrimination of true from false positives in case more than one protein was retrieved. The mouse ribosomal protein S3 cDNA was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR using total cellular RNA isolated from MEL cells. Reverse transcriptase-PCR, RNA isolation, and molecular cloning were carried out according to Ausubel et al. (20$$Google Scholar). The primers are designed according to DNA sequences for S3 in GenBank (Accession no. X76772) with additional sequences at 5′ end (lowercase letters below) that contain restriction enzyme sites (HindIII for the 5′ end primers and BglII for the 3′ end primers). The sequences of these primers are as follows: 5′ end primer, 5′-ccc aag ctt ATG GCG GTG CAG ATT TCC AAG-3′; 3′ end primer, 5′-ata aga tct CCA GAT GCA GCT CGC CAA GAC-3′. PCR products were ligated into pGEM-T vector (Promega) and verified by DNA sequencing. Inserts from clones with the correct DNA sequences were released from the vector byHindIII and BglII digestion, gel-purified, and ligated into HindIII- and BglII-digested pFLAG-MAC vector (Kodak). Transformation, confirmation of FLAG fusion junction, preparation of bacterial lysates, and analyses of FLAG-S3 fusion protein were done according to manufacturer's instruction (Kodak). Bacterial lysates containing no fusion protein and FLAG-S3 were subjected to photoaffinity labeling as described above. Photoaffinity-labeled samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Expression of S3 was detected by rabbit polyclonal anti-S3 antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (21Lutsch G. Stahl J. Kargel H.-J. Noll F. Bielka H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 51: 140-150PubMed Google Scholar). The signal was detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce). We designed a photoaffinity labeling reagent structurally based on SAHA (TableI). The phenyl azide moiety was chosen as the photoactivatable group for two reasons. (a) The utility of phenyl azides as photoaffinity labeling reagents is well known and documented (22Patai S. Chemistry of Functional Groups. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988Google Scholar). Upon photolysis at 254 nm, azido groups generate a highly reactive nitrene that can bind to many cellular components. (b) The photoaffinity labeling reagent maintains its activity as a potent inducer of differentiation. We have previously synthesized a SAHA analog (498; Table I), and found that incorporation of an azido group in the para position of the benzene ring does not interfere with the differentiation activity (Fig. 2). Tritium labeling was chosen over other isotopes since bulky substituents such as iodine resulted in a marked decrease in the potency of the inducer. The synthesis of[ 3 H]498 (Fig.1) involved introduction of tritium by catalytic dehalogenation of suberic hydroxamic acid (4-amino-3,5-diiodoaniline) amide 7, followed by conversion of the amine to an azide. Radiolabeling had to precede azide formation because of the instability of the azide group to the reduction conditions used to introduce tritium. Diiodination of 4-nitroaniline 1 with iodine monochloride (23Sandin R.B. Drake W.V. Leger F. Org. Syn. Coll. 1943; II: 196-197Google Scholar) gave rise to 2,6-diiodo-4-nitroaniline 2, which was reduced with SnCl2 (24Willgerodt C. Arnold E. Chem. Berichte. 1904; : 3351Google Scholar) to yield 2,6-diiodo-4-aminoaniline3. Activation of suberic acid monomethyl ester with carbonyl diimidazole followed by coupling to 3 gave rise to the ester4. The ester was hydrolyzed with LiOH to yield the carboxylic acid 5 (25Corey E.J. Szekely I. Shiner C.S. Tetrahedron Lett. 1977; : 3529Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The t-butyldiphenylsilyl protected hydroxamic acid 6 was prepared by activation of5 with carbonyl diimidazole, followed by reaction with the silyl protected hydroxylamine. Deprotection with tetrabutylammonium fluoride gave rise to hydroxamic acid 7. Compound7 was catalytically tritiated with3H2/Pd-C in methanol/H2O/Na2CO3 to yield8 (specific activity 40 Ci/mmol). Compound 8 was diluted 10-fold with nonradioactive analog 8a, diazotized, and treated with sodium azide to yield suberic hydroxamic acid (4-azido-3,5-ditritioaniline) amide ([ 3 H]498, specific activity 4 Ci/mmol). At 3.5 μm,498 induces on the average 50% of the cells to differentiate (Fig. 2). In addition, cell growth is inhibited by more than 50% (data not shown). In comparison, SAHA induces on the average about 70% of the cells to differentiate at 2.5 μm (Fig. 2), inhibiting cell growth by more than 50% (data not shown). Our preparation of[ 3 H]498 was found to have a level of activity similar to that of the nonradioactive analog 498(data not shown). We asked initially whether [ 3 H]498specifically binds any cellular proteins. We separated specific from nonspecific interactions by competition with excess nonradioactive analog 498. Whole cell lysates were prepared from MEL cells, incubated with [ 3 H]498 in the presence or absence of nonradioactive 498 and irradiated. Protein samples were solubilized in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by fluorography. We observed (Fig.3 A) one specifically radiolabeled protein of 32 kDa (p32) and several nonspecifically labeled proteins. Furthermore, we specifically labeled p32 in the T24 human bladder carcinoma cell line and the ARP 1 human myeloma cell line (data not shown). SAHA-like HPCs induce T24 cells to differentiate (7Richon V.M. Emilliani S. Verdin E. Webb Y. Breslow R. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3003-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar) and ARP 1 cells to undergo apoptosis (7Richon V.M. Emilliani S. Verdin E. Webb Y. Breslow R. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3003-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Thus p32, has been identified as a SAHA-like HPC-binding protein. To determine the cellular distribution of p32, we prepared P10, P100, and S100 fractions from MEL cells and assayed for the presence of p32. Fig. 3 B shows that p32 localizes to the P100 fraction, and is the most abundant protein detected by the label in this fraction. To establish that binding to p32 occurs at the same concentration range at which SAHA and [ 3 H]498 induce differentiation, we followed the specific binding of[ 3 H]498 to p32 by incubating P100 fractions with different concentrations of the compound in the presence or absence of excess 498. [ 3 H]498can be detected specifically bound to p32 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 C), and at the concentration in which it is active as an inducer of differentiation. Furthermore, we performed a dose-response competition experiment, by incubating P100 fractions with 5 μm [ 3 H]498 and varying the concentration of 498. The labeling of p32 by[ 3 H]498 can be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner with increasing concentrations of498 (Fig. 3 D). We partially purified p32 by sequential extraction taking advantage of solubility differences between p32 and other cellular components. P100 fractions were extracted with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, partitioning p32 into the detergent-resistant fraction (PTx). PTx fractions were extracted with buffer containing 0.1% Zwittergent 3-16, partitioning p32 into the detergent soluble fraction (STx+zw) (Fig.4 A). Silver staining (Fig.4 B) confirmed the partial purifica"

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1656-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)-mediated transcriptional activation. Four mechanisms have been postulated to underlie modulation of multiple signaling pathways by COUP-TF subfamily members: 1) competition for DNA response element binding, 2) inactive heterocomplex formation including titration of retinoid X receptor (RXR), 3) active silencing of basal transcription, and 4) transcriptional transrepression (16Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Of these potential mechanisms, competition for binding to response elements is well documented and is based upon the ability of COUP-TF proteins to bind a large variety of response elements (16Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). COUP-TFI and ARP1 are known to form homodimers in solution and to bind promiscuously as such to direct repeats (DR) of the canonical half-site AGGTCA exhibiting the highest affinity for a DR spaced by 1 base pair (DR1; Refs. 1Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1448-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar and3Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). ARP1 and COUP-TFI share extensive identity, particularly in the ligand and DNA binding domains (Refs. 12Ladias J.A.A. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Cardot P. Cheng J. Zannis V. Caldaras C. J.

Dev. 1994; 47: 81-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 1). Ear2 is less well conserved with either protein in these domains (Fig. 1), which has led some to suggest that Ear2 may not be a member of COUP-TF subfamily of nuclear receptors (16Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). However, based on compelling evolutionary arguments, Escriva and co-workers (19Escriva H. Safi R. Hanni C. Langlois M.-C. Saumitou-Laprade P. Stehelini D. Capron A. Pierce R. Laudet V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moreover, other groups consider Ear2 to be a member of COUP-TF subfamily based on the capacity of this protein to form homodimeric, DNA binding complexes and to repress ligand-dependent activation of target genes mediated by other nuclear receptors, such as retinoic acid (1Kliewer S.A.

COUP-TFI and ARP1 play important roles in development, particularly in patterning of the nervous system in Xenopus (21van der Wees J. Matharu P.J. de Roos K. Destree O.H. Godsave S.F. Durston A.J.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1925-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). COUP-TFI null animals exhibit perinatal lethality, possibly arising from malformations of the glossopharyngeal ganglion and associated IXth cranial nerve resulting in an inability to feed properly (25Qiu Y. Pereira F.A. DeMayo F.J. Lydon J.P. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1925-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Given the overall similarity between COUP-TFI and ARP1, both in terms of structural conservation and overlapping patterns of expression in the developing central nervous system (24Qiu Y. Cooney A. Kuratani S. DeMayo F.J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4451-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), it seems remarkable that ARP1 does not compensate for the lack of COUP-TFI expression in these animals (25Qiu Y. Pereira F.A. DeMayo F.J. Lydon J.P. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1925-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Knock-out of the ARP1 gene in the mouse is apparently embryonic lethal (16Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that Ear2 and ARP1 form heterodimers in yeast and in vitro, both in solution and on directly repeated response elements. Moreover, these orphan receptors were shown to interact in mammalian cells and to be coexpressed in the embryo and in two embryonal carcinoma cell lines as well as in several adult tissues suggesting that ARP1·Ear2 heterodimeric complexes may play a role(s) in embryonic development and in the adult organism. The bait vectors (pBTM116 and pBL1) for the yeast two-hybrid screen and the yeast reporter strains L40 (26Le Douarin B. Pierrat B. vom Baur E. Chambon P. Losson R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 876-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and PL3 (27Pierrat B. Heery D. Lemoine Y. Losson R. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 119: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) were all generous gifts from Drs. R. Losson and P. Chambon (IGBMC, Illkirch, France). Human ARP1 (ARP1, Ref. 28Nakshatri H. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 890-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. H. Nakshatri, and NR1 was a kind gift from Dr. S. Nakanishi. A fragment corresponding to the hinge and putative ligand binding domain of ARP1 (regions D and E, amino acids 144–414) was amplified by PCR and cloned into both pBTM116 and pBL1 (26Le Douarin B. Pierrat B. vom Baur E. Chambon P. Losson R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 876-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), encoding LexA DBD-ARP1 DE and ER DBD-ARP1 DE fusion proteins, respectively. Receptor bait constructs for mouse RXRα (amino acids 132–467) and human RARγ (amino acids 90–454) have been described previously (29Dowell P. Ishmael J. Avram D. Peterson V. Nevrivy D. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33435-33443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). An unrelated bait corresponding to the carboxyl tail (amino acids 835–938) of the NR1 subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (30Moriyoshi K. Masu M. Ishii T. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1991; 354: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar) was similarly prepared for these studies. All fragments amplified by PCR were verified by sequence analysis. A mammalian expression vector encoding an ER DBD/ARP1 DE fusion protein was constructed by inserting the EcoRI fragment of pBL1-ARP1 DE into the EcoRI site of pTL1 (31Leid M. Kastner P. Lyons R. Nakshatri H. Saunders M. Zacharewski T. Chen J.-Y. Staub A. Garnier J.-M. Mader S. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 68: 377-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). A mammalian expression vector encoding the DE region of mouse Ear2 (amino acids 122–390) fused to the transcriptional activation domain of GAL4 (GAL4 AD; amino acids 768–881) was prepared by insertion of the corresponding Ear2 fragment into pACT2 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), yielding pACT2-Ear2 DE. This plasmid was then digested withHindIII, excising the GAL4 AD-Ear2 DE fragment, which was subsequently cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector, pTL1. An amino-terminal truncation mutant of ARP1, mycARP1ΔAB, with a myc epitope tag at the amino terminus was prepared by PCR amplification of an appropriate fragment and insertion into pTL1. Full-length Ear2, fused to an HA epitope tag and the GAL 4 AD, was excised from the library plasmid (pACT2) by digestion with HindIII, and the resulting fragment was ligated into pTL1 creating HA-Ear2. The latter two constructs were prepared for use in DNA binding experiments designed to distinguish between heterodimeric complexes of intermediate electrophoretic mobility and homodimeric complexes composed of either receptor. The ER-responsive CAT reporter, 17-mer-ERE-globin-CAT, has been described previously (32Nagpal S. Saunders M. Kastner P. Durand B. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 70: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were prepared for ARP1 DE (GST-ARP1 DE) and Ear2 DE (GST-Ear2 DE) by PCR amplification of the corresponding fragments and subcloning into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) that had been previously digested with BamHI andEcoRI. The integrity of all constructs was verified by sequence analysis. Saccharomyces cerevisiaeL40 reporter strain expressing ARP1 (D and E regions) was transformed with a mouse brain cDNA library (CLONTECH) fused to the GAL4 AD on a leucine-selectable vector, pACT2. The screen for ARP1-interacting clones was conducted in synthetic medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine and supplemented with 20 mm 3-aminotriazole. The plasmids from positive clones containing the brain cDNAs were rescued, shuttled inEscherichia coli, and sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide dye terminator method on an Applied Biosystems, Inc., model 373 or 377 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) at the Central Services Laboratory of the Oregon State University Center for Gene Research and Biotechnology. Filter assays were utilized to confirm the positive clones. For quantitative purposes the positive clones were grown in synthetic medium to an A 600of approximately 2 units, and β-galactosidase activity was assayed as described by Kippert (33Kippert F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 128: 201-206PubMed Google Scholar), and modified by Avram and Bakalinsky (34Avram D. Bakalinsky A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 511-521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand-dependent assays were carried out by inclusion of 1 μm 9-cis-RA or identical amounts of vehicle in the culture medium. GST pull-down experiments were conducted as described previously (29Dowell P. Ishmael J. Avram D. Peterson V. Nevrivy D. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33435-33443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 35Dowell P. Peterson V.J. Zabriskie T.M. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2013-2020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). EMSAs were conducted essentially as described previously (31Leid M. Kastner P. Lyons R. Nakshatri H. Saunders M. Zacharewski T. Chen J.-Y. Staub A. Garnier J.-M. Mader S. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 68: 377-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). ARP1ΔAB and HA-Ear2 were expressed by in vitro transcription/translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega). In each case the receptors used for gel retardation assays were translated in parallel in the presence of [35S]methionine for the purpose of quantification. The DR1(G) response element upper strand had the following sequence (canonical half-sites are bold and underlined): 5′-TCGAGGGTAGAGGTCAGAGGTCACTCG-3′; DR2(G) through DR5(G) were synthesized with identical flanking and repeated hexanucleotide sequence but with the following inter-repeat spacers (5′ to 3′): GA (DR2), CGA (DR3), CGAA (DR4), and CCGAA (DR5). The DR(T) series of oligonucleotides were identical to the DR(G) series except that the repeated hexanucleotide had the sequence AGTTCA. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (ATCC CRL 1573) were cultured in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Summit, Boulder, CO) and 4 mm glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were grown to 50–60% confluence and transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate method. Each 100-mm plate was cotransfected with 1 μg of expression vector encoding the ER DBD or ER DBD/ARP1 DE, 1 μg of GAL4 AD, or GAL4 AD/Ear2 DE, 2 μg of the 17-mer-ERE-Globin-CAT reporter construct, and 10 ng of pCMV-SPORT-βgal (Life Technologies, Inc.) encoding β-galactosidase which was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and extracts were prepared using standard techniques. β-Galactosidase activity in cellular extracts was quantified using a colorimetric assay, and CAT activity was determined by thin layer chromatography. First strand cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg of RNA (Ambion, Austin, TX) and 100 ng of random hexamer primers (Promega) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm concentrations of each dNTP, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a total volume of 25 μl, and the reactions were carried out for 30 min at 37 °C. One μl of each reverse transcription reaction was subjected to PCR amplification using ARP1-, Ear2-, and 36B4 (36Kronczynska A.M. Coutts M. Makrides S. Brawerman G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)-specific primers. ARP1 and Ear2 amplifications were carried out for 25 cycles, whereas amplification of 36B4 was conducted for 19 cycles. Amplification of 36B4 was used as a control for the quantity of cDNA present in each sample as well in normalization of gel loading and Southern blotting. Note that, in general, one cycle consisted of the following steps: 94 °C × 30 s, 50 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 60 s; however, the annealing temperature was varied for each set of primers to optimize amplification. Amplification products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and then transferred to ZetaProbe membranes (Bio-Rad). The blots were probed with specific, end-labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to internal sequence in the PCR products. RT-PCR analyses of ARP1 and Ear2 expression in F9 and P19 embryonal carcinoma cells treated in monolayers with either vehicle ortrans-retinoic acid for 24 h were carried out as described above. A fragment encoding the ARP1 hinge region and putative ligand binding domain was used as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins expressed in brain that interact with ARP1, which is highly expressed in brain (Refs. 18Jonk L.J.C. de Jonge E.J.

Brain Res. 1995; 30: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, and this report). A protein found to interact with ARP1 was Ear2, another member of steroid hormone receptor superfamily, which is closely related to COUP-TF subfamily, that includes COUP-TFI and ARP1 (Fig.1). The Ear2 clone isolated in our screen contains the entire open reading frame identified by Jonk and co-workers (18Jonk L.J.C. de Jonge E.J. Pals C.E.G.M. Wissink S. Vervaart J.M.A. Schoorlemmer J. Kruijer W. Mech. Dev. 1994; 47: 81-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, the present clone contains 183 base pairs upstream of the putative initiator methionine previously described (18Jonk L.J.C. de Jonge E.J. Pals C.E.G.M. Wissink S. Vervaart J.M.A. Schoorlemmer J. Kruijer W. Mech. Dev. 1994; 47: 81-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, as there is no in frame stop codon(s) in this upstream sequence, it is possible that the actual Ear2 protein is extended in the amino terminus beyond the previously identified initiator methionine (18Jonk L.J.C. de Jonge E.J. Pals C.E.G.M. Wissink S. Vervaart J.M.A. Schoorlemmer J. Kruijer W. Mech. Dev. 1994; 47: 81-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To evaluate the specificity of ARP1-Ear2 interaction, we examined interactions of Ear2 with RAR, RXR, and an unrelated bait, the carboxyl terminus of the NR1 subunit of theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (30Moriyoshi K. Masu M. Ishii T. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1991; 354: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar). The interaction of Ear2 with ARP1 was specific inasmuch as Ear2 did not interact with RXRα or RARα in the presence or absence of 9-cis-retinoic acid (Fig. 2). Similarly, Ear2 did not interact with the carboxyl terminus of NR1 (Fig. 2). A qualitative, in vitro protein-protein interaction study was conducted to confirm the ARP1-Ear2 interaction observed in yeast and to investigate the ability of each protein to self-associate. The hinge and putative LDB regions of each protein were fused to glutathioneS-transferase (GST), creating GST-ARP1 DE and GST-Ear2 DE, and both proteins were expressed in bacteria for use in standard GST pull-down experiments (29Dowell P. Ishmael J. Avram D. Peterson V. Nevrivy D. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33435-33443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 35Dowell P. Peterson V.J. Zabriskie T.M. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2013-2020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). [35S]Met-labeled Ear2 interacted with GST-ARP1 DE (Fig.3 A, lane 3) confirming the interaction observed in yeast. [35S]Met-labeled Ear2 was also found to interact with itself (GST-Ear2 DE, lane 4) with efficiency nearly identical to that with which it interacted with GST-ARP1 DE (lane 3) suggesting that Ear2 may form heterodimeric and homodimeric complexes with equal facility. Similarly, [35S]Met-labeled ARP1ΔAB interacted with both GST-Ear2 DE and -ARP1 DE fusion proteins (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3and 4, respectively) but not with glutathione charged with GST alone (lane 2). These in vitro findings corroborate results obtained in yeast (Fig. 2) and also suggest that ARP1 and Ear2 participate in heterodimeric interactions in solution with an apparent efficiency comparable to that of the homodimerization involving either receptor. COUP-TFI, ARP1, and Ear2 form homodimers in solution and bind promiscuously to direct repeats (DR) of the canonical half-site, AGGTCA, with varied inter-repeat spacing. However, all of these receptors exhibit a degree of selectivity for DRs spaced by a single base pair (DR1) (1Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1448-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 3Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In addition, COUP-TFI and ARP1 bind as a heterodimeric complex to DR elements composed of varied spacing (3Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Based on our observation that ARP1 and Ear2 form heterodimers in yeast (Fig. 2) and in solution (Fig. 3), we conducted electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to determine if ARP1 and Ear2 bind to directly repeated response elements as a heterodimeric complex. mycARP1ΔAB homodimeric complexes bound in a protein concentration-dependent manner to the DR1 probe (Fig.4, lanes 1–3; complex C5). HA-Ear2 formed two complexes, C1 and C2, that exhibited differential electrophoretic mobility on this probe (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and5). The two species of HA-Ear2, which bound to this probe in a protein concentration-dependent manner, most likely arose from correct and internal initiation of HA-Ear2 translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (data not shown). At comparable amounts of protein, HA-Ear2 (C1 and C2) clearly bound to the DR1 probe less efficiently than mycARP1ΔAB (C5; compare lanes 1–3 to 4–6 of Fig. 4). However, incubation of a fixed amount of mycARP1ΔAB with increasing amounts of HA-Ear2 resulted in the complete titration of the mycARP1ΔAB homodimeric complex (C5) into mycARP1ΔAB·HA-Ear2 heterodimeric complexes, C3 and C4 (Fig. 4,lanes 7–9). When excessive amounts of HA-Ear2 were used, the appearance of HA-Ear2 homodimeric complexes (C1 and C2) were also evident (Fig. 4, lanes 8–9). Similarly, titration of a fixed amount of HA-Ear2 with increasing amounts of mycARP1ΔAB quantitatively shifted HA-Ear2 homodimeric complexes (C1 and C2) into mycARP1ΔAB·HA-Ear2 heterodimeric complexes (C3 andC4; Fig. 4, lanes 10–12). The homodimeric mycARP1ΔAB complex (C5) was apparent when this protein was used in excess (Fig. 4, lanes 11 and 12). Complexes C1/C2 and C5 were supershifted with anti-HA and anti-myc antibodies, respectively, whereas both antibodies supershifted complexes C3 and C4, confirming the identity of each complex (data not shown). We next sought to determine if the capacity of ARP1 and Ear2 to bind directly repeated response elements as homodimeric and/or heterodimeric complexes was a function of the length of the inter-repeat spacer. mycARP1ΔAB homodimers bound to probes with spacing ranging from 1 to 5 base pairs (complex C5; Fig.5 A, lanes 1, 4, 7, 10, and13) with somewhat varied efficiency (DR2 ≥ DR1 > DR5 > DR3 > DR4). Conversely, HA-Ear2 did not appear to bind any of these probes with the exception of DR1, to which HA-Ear2 homodimers bound weakly at the relatively low amount of HA-Ear2 protein used in these experiments (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, and14). mycARP1ΔAB·HA-Ear2 heterodimeric complexes (C3 and C4) bound to probes of all spacings with a distinct preference for DR1 and DR2 (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15). Thus, mycARP1ΔAB·HA-Ear2 heterodimeric complexes exhibited a DNA binding specificity (DR1 ≥ DR2 > DR4 > DR5 > DR3) that was clearly distinct from that of HA-Ear2 homodimers (which bound weakly to DR1 only) and subtly distinct from mycARP1ΔAB homodimeric complexes (see above). Methylation interference studies have implicated a role for the guanines present in each half-site of a DR1-type response element in the specific interaction of COUP-TFI with DNA (38Hwung Y.-P. Wang L.-H. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13470-13474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To address the potential role of the second guanine (G2) in each AGGTCA half-site in DNA recognition by ARP1·ARP1, ARP1·Ear2, and Ear2·Ear2 complexes, EMSAs were carried out using a series of probes in which G2 in each half-site was mutated to thymidine (see Fig. 5 B). This G2 → T mutation had a dramatic effect on the efficiency of both mycARP1ΔAB homodimer and mycARP1ΔAB·HA-Ear2 heterodimer binding to probes of all spacing (Fig. 5 B). However, mycARP1ΔAB homodimers did bind to the “T” series probe with a single base pair spacer, DR1(T) (Fig. 5 B, lane 1), and with lower efficiency to DR5(T) (lane 13) and DR3(T) (lane 7). In contrast, mycARP1ΔAB·HA-Ear2 heterodimer binding was not evident on any of the “T” series probes with the pos"

This function relates to the ability of CD45 to regulate p56 lck, a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase necessary for T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling. Previous studies have demonstrated that CD45 is constitutively associated in T-lymphocytes with a transmembrane molecule termed CD45-AP (or lymphocyte phosphatase-associated phosphoprotein). Even though the exact role of this polypeptide is unclear, recent analyses of mice lacking CD45-AP have indicated that its expression is also required for optimal T-cell activation. Herein, we wished to understand better the function of CD45-AP. The results of our studies showed that in T-cells, CD45-AP is part of a multimolecular complex that includes not only CD45, but also TCR, the CD4 and CD8 coreceptors, and p56 lck. The association of CD45-AP with TCR, CD4, and CD8 seemed to occur via the shared ability of these molecules to bind CD45. However, binding of CD45-AP to p56 lck could take place in the absence of other lymphoid-specific components, suggesting that it can be direct. Structure-function analyses demonstrated that such an interaction was mediated by an acidic segment in the cytoplasmic region of CD45-AP and by the kinase domain of p56 lck. Interestingly, the ability of CD45-AP to interact with Lck in the absence of other lymphoid-specific molecules was proportional to the degree of catalytic activation of p56 lck. Together, these findings suggest that CD45-AP is an adaptor molecule involved in orchestrating interactions among components of the antigen receptor signaling machinery. Moreover, they raise the possibility that one of the functions of CD45-AP is to recognize activated Lck molecules and bring them into the vicinity of CD45.

Activation of T-lymphocytes by antigen is initiated by protein tyrosine phosphorylation (1Wange R.L. Samelson L.E.

Although the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T-cell antigen receptor; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; CD45-AP, CD45-associated protein; MAb, monoclonal antibody and the associated CD3 and ζ subunits are devoid of intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity, they can recruit two classes of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases to mediate this response, the Src family and the Syk/Zap-70 family. The Src-related enzymes Lck and FynT initiate TCR-mediated signals by phosphorylating a signaling motif in the cytoplasmic domain of CD3 and ζ termed ITAM (for immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif). Following this phosphorylation, the Syk/Zap-70 family kinases are activated through binding of their tandem Src homology 2 (SH2) domains to doubly phosphorylated ITAMs. Together with Src family kinases, Zap-70 and Syk are responsible for subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of several signal transduction molecules including phospholipase C-γ1, Cbl, Vav, Slp-76, and Lat. CD45 is a 180–220-kDa transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase expressed on all nucleated hemopoietic cells (5Thomas M.L. Semin.

In T-cells it constitutes ∼10% of all cell surface glycoproteins. Previous studies have shown that CD45 is necessary for T-cell activation because of its ability to promote constitutive dephosphorylation of the inhibitory carboxyl-terminal tyrosine of p56 lck, tyrosine 505 (7Pingel J.T.

This dephosphorylation is necessary for Lck to become activated and phosphorylate the TCR complex upon antigen stimulation. There is also an indication that CD45 is able to dephosphorylate other substrates, including the positive regulatory site of Lck (tyrosine 394) and the ζ subunit of TCR (10Furukawa T. Itoh M.

Although the precise mechanism by which CD45 specifically targets these substrates is not established, it is noteworthy that small amounts of p56 lck, but not FynT, can be found to coimmunoprecipitate with CD45 in mild detergent lysates of T-cells (13Schraven B.

Furthermore, CD45 has been shown to colocalize on the cell with several other molecules, including the TCR complex, CD4, CD2, and Thy-1 (16Schraven B. Samstag Y. Altevogt P. Meuer S.C.

Thus, it is possible that the specificity of CD45 toward its substrates is dictated in part by its relative distribution on the cell surface. Previous studies have demonstrated that the majority of CD45 molecules in T-cells is associated with a 30-kDa polypeptide termed CD45-associated protein (CD45-AP) or lymphocyte phosphatase-associated phosphoprotein (hereafter named CD45-AP) (22Schraven B.

Ohta T. Kimura S. J Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 2357-2360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Through molecular cloning, CD45-AP was shown to be a novel transmembrane protein with a short extracellular domain of ∼9 amino acids, a single transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic region of ∼145 residues (see Fig.8 A) (23Schraven B.

Structure-function analyses and experiments with recombinant proteins have revealed that the interaction between CD45 and CD45-AP is direct and that it occurs via their respective transmembrane segments (25McFarland E.D.C.

Thomas M.L. J Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 28103-28107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); however, the affinity of this association was apparently low because it could be detected only through in vitro kinase reactions and not by Western blotting. The importance of CD45-AP in normal cellular physiology was addressed recently by the creation of CD45-AP-deficient mice through homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells (30Matsuda A. Motoya S. Kimura S. McInnis R. Maizel A.L. Takeda A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1863-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although T-cell development was not noticeably affected in these mice, thymocytes and splenic T-cells exhibited a decrease in proliferation in response to TCR stimulation. CD45-AP-deficient T-cells were also less efficient at mediating effector functions such as cytolysis. Although a precise biochemical explanation for these defects was not established, it is noteworthy that CD45-AP-deficient T-cells also demonstrated a reduction in CD45 expression and in the amount of p56 lckthat can be coimmunoprecipitated with CD45. In this paper, we wish to explore further the role of CD45-AP in T-lymphocytes. The results of our experiments showed that CD45-AP is part of a complex that contains not only CD45 but also the antigen receptor, the CD4 and CD8 coreceptors, and p56 lck. They also demonstrated clearly that an interaction between CD45-AP and Lck can occur in the absence of other lymphoid-specific molecules and that this association is proportional to the degree of enzymatic activation of p56 lck. Thymocytes were extracted from 5–6-week-old Balb/c mice. BI-141 is an antigen-specific mouse T-cell line (31Reske-Kunz A.B. Rude E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1985; 15: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It expresses TCR, CD3, and CD45 but lacks CD4 and CD8. Because BI-141 contains very low amounts of endogenous p56 lck, a variant transfected with a wild-type lck cDNA was used for some of the experiments (32Abraham N. Miceli M.C. Parnes J.R. Veillette A. Nature. 1991; 350: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Monoclonal cell lines expressing either Tac-ε or Tac-ζ were generated by transfection. 2S. Latour, E. Henry, and A.

All lymphoid cells were propagated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and antibiotics. Whenever appropriate, the aminoglycoside G418 (0.6 mg/ml) was also added to the growth medium. COS-1 cells were grown as detailed elsewhere (36Fournel M. Davidson D. Weil R. Veillette A. J. Exp.

Variants in which the sequences coding for the carboxyl-terminal region of CD45-AP were truncated were also generated by polymerase chain reaction. In the process, a Myc-derived epitope was inserted at their carboxyl terminus. cDNAs coding for wild-type, ΔU, ΔSH3, ΔSH2, Y394F, Y505F, G2A/Y505F, ΔU/Y505F, K273R/Y505F, and Y394F/Y505F Lck were reported previously (32Abraham N.

Anlck cDNA lacking the sequences encoding the kinase domain (ΔK lck) was produced by digesting the wild-type cDNA with NcoI, blunting the resulting DNA fragment, and ligating with a linker containing a stop codon. This deletion removed the kinase and negative regulatory domains of p56 lck. All constructs were verified by sequencing to ensure that no unwanted mutation had been introduced (data not shown). For transfection in COS-1 cells, the various cDNAs were cloned in the multiple cloning site of pXM139, which contains the SV40 origin of replication. Transfections in COS-1 cells were performed as described elsewhere (36Fournel M. Davidson D. Weil R. Veillette A. J. Exp.

A polyclonal antiserum directed against CD45-AP was produced in rabbits using a fusion protein encompassing the cytoplasmic domain of CD45-AP as an immunogen.

Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) reacting with CD45 (M1.89.18.7), TCR (F23.1 and H57), CD3 (145–2C11 for immunoprecipitation; HMT-3 for immunoblotting), ζ (H146), Thy-1 (G7), CD4 (GK1.5), CD8 (2.43), Tac (7G7), and Myc (9E10) were reported elsewhere. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in Brij-97-containing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Brij-97, 2 mmEDTA) supplemented with 10 μg/ml each of the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone,N-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, as well as the phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride (50 mm) and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm). For COS-1 cells, cells were lysed in TNE buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA), supplemented with the same inhibitors. Polypeptides were recovered by immunoprecipitation from equivalent amounts of total cellular proteins using the indicated antibodies, precoupled to protein A or protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In some cases, immune complexes were collected with Staphylococcus aureus protein A (Pansorbin; Calbiochem), coupled, if indicated, to rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Ig) G. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Proteins were then eluted in sample buffer, boiled, electrophoresed in 8% (Lck), 10% (CD45-AP and ε) or 12% (ζ) SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred onto Immobilon membranes (Millipore) for immunoblotting. Immunoblots were performed according to a protocol described previously (42Veillette A. Bookman M.A. Horak E.M. Bolen J.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). After incubation with125I-protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or125I-goat anti-mouse IgG (ICN), immunoreactive products were detected by autoradiography and quantitated with a PhosphorImager (BAS 2000; Fuji). To gain more understanding of the function of CD45-AP in T-lymphocytes, its ability to interact with molecules other than CD45 was evaluated. Normal ex vivo mouse thymocytes were lysed in Brij-97-containing buffer, and various polypeptides were immunoprecipitated from postnuclear cell lysates using the indicated antibodies. After separation in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the presence of CD45-AP in these immunoprecipitates was determined by immunoblotting with a rabbit antiserum directed against the cytoplasmic domain of CD45-AP (Fig. 1 A). As reported earlier (23Schraven B. Schoenhaut D. Bruyns E. Koretzky G. Eckerskorn C. Wallich R. Kirchgessner H. Sakorafas P. Labkovsky B. Ratnofsky S. Meuer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29102-29111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Takeda A. Maizel A.L. Kitamura K. Ohta T. Kimura S. J Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 2357-2360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), large amounts of CD45-AP were found to coimmunoprecipitate with CD45 (lane 3).Unexpectedly, though, we observed that appreciable quantities of CD45-AP were also present in immunoprecipitates of Lck (lanes 4 and 5), CD4 (lane 8), CD8 (lane 9), and TCR-associated CD3 (lane 10). In contrast, no CD45-AP was detected in FynT immunoprecipitates (lanes 6 and 7) or in immunoprecipitates obtained with normal rabbit serum (lane 11). It is notable that CD45-AP migrated as three distinct species in these gels, in agreement with earlier reports (23Schraven B. Schoenhaut D. Bruyns E. Koretzky G. Eckerskorn C. Wallich R. Kirchgessner H. Sakorafas P. Labkovsky B. Ratnofsky S. Meuer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29102-29111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These variations in the apparent molecular mass of CD45-AP are apparently caused by serine phosphorylation (23Schraven B. Schoenhaut D. Bruyns E. Koretzky G. Eckerskorn C. Wallich R. Kirchgessner H. Sakorafas P. Labkovsky B. Ratnofsky S. Meuer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29102-29111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To address the specificity of these associations, the ability to CD45-AP to coimmunoprecipitate with a series of other signal transduction molecules expressed in thymocytes was assessed (Fig.1 B). Contrary to p56 lck (lane 1) and the TCR-associated ζ chain (lane 10), no CD45-AP was associated with the protein tyrosine kinases Csk (lane 3) and Chk (lane 4), the adaptor molecules Cbl (lane 7) and Shc (lane 9), and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav (lane 8). However, a small quantity was detected in Zap-70 (lane 5) and Syk (lane 6) immunoprecipitates. Because Syk/Zap-70 family kinases are known to be constitutively associated with TCR in thymocytes (49van Oers N.S. Killeen N. Weiss A. Immunity. 1994; 1: 675-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), it is plausible that these interactions were mediated via the TCR. We also wanted to test whether components of the TCR complex could be found in immunoprecipitates of CD45-AP (Fig.2). Therefore, thymocyte lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against either CD45-AP or CD45, and the presence of the ζ subunit of TCR in these immunoprecipitates was revealed by immunoblotting with anti-ζ MAb H146. This experiment demonstrated that significant amounts of ζ were immunoprecipitated both with CD45-AP (lane 1) and with CD45 (lane 2) but not when normal rabbit serum (lane 4) or an irrelevant MAb antibody (anti-Tac MAb 7G7; data not shown) was used as immunoprecipitating reagent. As expected, large quantities of ζ were also detectable in anti-CD3 immunoprecipitates (lane 3). In combination, these data revealed that CD45-AP could be coimmunoprecipitated not only with CD45 but also with several elements of the antigen receptor complex in thymocytes, including TCR, CD3ζ, CD4, and CD8, as well as with p56 lck. To understand the mechanism(s) of these interactions, we first investigated whether they required the presence of CD4 and CD8 by performing similar analyses with the CD4-negative, CD8-negative mouse T-cell line BI-141 (Fig.3). As was the case in thymocytes (Fig.1), significant amounts of CD45-AP were present in immunoprecipitates of CD45 (Fig. 3, lane 2), CD3 (lane 6), TCR (lanes 7 and 8), and ζ (lane 9) in BI-141 cells. Smaller quantities were also detected in anti-Lck immunoprecipitates (lane 3). However, there was no CD45-AP associated with FynT (lane 4) or the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked molecule Thy-1 (lane 10), even though both molecules are expressed abundantly in BI-141 cells (data not shown). Moreover, no CD45-AP was recovered when an antibody against CD4 (lane 5) or normal rabbit serum (lane 11) was used for immunoprecipitation. Thus, the interaction of CD45-AP with TCR (and Lck) could take place in the absence of CD4 and CD8. Next, we wished to determine whether the CD45-AP-TCR interaction was direct. Because CD45-AP contains only a few extracellular residues and its transmembrane region is already involved in binding to CD45, we were especially interested in testing the possibility that its intracytoplasmic region may bind the intracellular sequences of CD3 and/or ζ. To this end, subclones of BI-141 bearing chimeras in which the cytoplasmic sequences of either ζ or the ε subunit of CD3 were fused to the extracellular and transmembrane regions of Tac were studied (Fig. 4). As in control BI-141 cells (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2 and 3), substantial amounts of CD45-AP were immunoprecipitated with CD45 (lanes 7 and 12) and CD3 (lanes 8 and13) in these derivatives. In contrast, though, none was associated with Tac-ε (lane 9) or Tac-ζ (lane 14), despite the fact that both chimeras were expressed at the cell surface (data not shown) and were present in amounts comparable or superior to those of the endogenous TCR-associated chains (Fig.4 B; data not shown). Similar results were obtained when individual chains of CD3ζ were transfected with CD45-AP in COS-1 cells (data not shown). Hence, these results implied that the interaction between CD45-AP and TCR was not mediated by the cytoplasmic domain of either ε or ζ. Unfortunately, similar experiments could not be performed with chimeras encompassing the cytoplasmic domain of the δ or γ subunit of CD3 because fusions were internalized rapidly and not expressed stably at the cell surface (data not shown). Studies of splicing isoforms of CD45 have indicated that CD45 and the TCR complex can interact by way of their extracellular domains (20Leitenberg D. Novak T.J. Farber D. Smith B.R. Bottomly K. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar,50Novak T.J. Farber D. Leitenberg D. Hong S.C. Johnson P. Bottomly K. Immunity. 1994; 1: 109-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). On this basis, the possibility that the CD45-AP-TCR interaction was mediated by CD45 was ascertained by studying T-cells lacking CD45 expression (Fig. 5). CD45-positive YAC-1 T-cells, as well as a variant lacking CD45 (YAC-N1), were lysed and processed for immunoprecipitation as outlined above. In keeping with our earlier observations (Figs. 1 and 3), CD45-AP was present in immunoprecipitates of CD3 and ζ from CD45-positive YAC-1 cells (Fig.5, lanes 3 and 4); however, it was not observed when similar immunoprecipitates were obtained from the CD45-negative variant (lanes 8 and 9). This difference was not the result of variations in TCR expression because both cell lines expressed comparable levels of TCR at the cell surface (data not shown). However, it is noteworthy that the abundance of CD45-AP in YAC-N1 (lane 6) was reduced ∼5-fold compared with that of its CD45-positive counterpart (lane 1). A similar decrease in CD45-AP expression has been reported in other CD45-negative T-cells (23Schraven B. Schoenhaut D. Bruyns E. Koretzky G. Eckerskorn C. Wallich R. Kirchgessner H. Sakorafas P.

Therefore, it is conceivable that the ability to detect CD45-AP·TCR complexes in YAC-N1 was hampered by the lowered abundance of CD45-AP. Nonetheless, because the amount of CD45-AP remaining in these cells was still significant (∼20% of control), we believe that this result is consistent with the idea that CD45 mediates the CD45-AP-TCR interaction. Similar findings were made using thymocytes from CD45-deficient mice (data not shown). Previously it was reported that small quantities of Lck could be observed in immunoprecipitates of the CD45 phosphatase obtained from mild detergent lysates of T-cells (13Schraven B. Kirchgessner H.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8958-8964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the basis for this association was not determined, it was shown to happen in the absence of CD4 and CD8 expression (15Ross S.E. Schraven B. Goldman F.D. Crabtree J. Koretzky G.A. Biochem.

Its expression is markedly down-regulated in de-differentiated VSMC, suggesting a role for APEG-1 in VSMC differentiation. We have now determined that APEG-1 is a single-copy gene in the human, rat, and mouse genomes and have mapped human APEG-1 to chromosome 2q34. To study the molecular mechanisms regulating its expression, we characterized the genomic organization and promoter of mouse APEG-1. APEG-1 spans 4.5 kb in the mouse genome and is composed of five exons. Using reporter gene transfection analysis, we found that a 2.7-kb APEG-15′-flanking sequence directed a high level of promoter activity only in VSMC. Its activity was minimal in five other cell types. A repressor region located within an upstream 685-base pair sequence suppressed the activity of this 2.7-kb promoter. Further deletion and mutation analyses identified an E box motif as a positive regulatory element, which was bound by nuclear protein prepared from VSMC. In conjunction with its flanking sequence, this E box motif confers VSMC-specific enhancer activity to a heterologous SV40 promoter.

Differentiation. 1993; 55: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), their expression in vivo is not restricted to VSMC. However, a 0.4-kb segment of the SM22α promoter, which contains two CArG elements, has been shown recently to confer expression only in the arterial SMC of transgenic mice (13Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 14Li L. Miano J.M. Mercer B. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Because mutation of the proximal CArG element eliminates all SM22α promoter activity in transgenic animals, this element appears to be necessary and sufficient for high-level expression restricted to the SMC lineage (13Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The CArG element binds to nuclear proteins such as serum response factor and YY1. Serum response factor and YY1 are both expressed ubiquitously; thus it is unclear how the CArG element regulates arterial SMC-specific expression conferred by the 0.4-kb segment of the SM22α promoter. This puzzle could be explained by the presence of arterial SMC-specific transacting factors or co-factors that have yet to be identified. Aortic preferentially expressed gene-1 (APEG-1) was cloned in our laboratory by virtue of its preferential expression in VSMC (15Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Endege W.O. Kho C.-J. Jain M.K.

These data suggest that APEG-1 may serve as a sensitive marker for VSMC differentiation, and that it may play a role in regulating growth and differentiation in this cell type. In this report we show that APEG-1 is a single-copy gene. The APEG-1 transcription unit spans 4.5 kb in the mouse genome and contains five exons. Using reporter gene transfection analysis, we found that 2.7 kb of the APEG-1 5′-flanking sequence contains potent VSMC-specific promoter activity. Further deletion and mutation analyses identified an E box motif as a positive regulatory element, which was bound by nuclear protein prepared from VSMC. In conjunction with its flanking sequence, this E box motif confers VSMC-specific enhancer activity to a heterologous promoter. Rat aortic SMC (RASMC) were harvested from the thoracic aortas of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) by enzymatic digestion (16Gunther S. Alexander R.W. Atkinson W.J. Gimbrone M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Bovine aortic endothelial cells were harvested from bovine aortic endothelium as described (17Lee M.-E. Bloch K.D. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10446-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). U-2 OS cells were kindly provided by Dr. T.-P. Yao (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). HeLa, HepG2, C2C12, and NIH 3T3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 4 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a humidified incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2). RASMC culture medium contained 10 mmHEPES (pH 7.4). Monc-1 cell culture and differentiation into SMC were as described (18Jain M.K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Chin M.T. Feinberg M.W. Sibinga N.E.

Genomic DNA was extracted from cultured mouse embryonic stem cells, RASMC, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Genomic DNA (10 μg) was digested with 50 units of the restriction enzymeXbaI, EcoRI, BamHI,HindIII, or SacI, separated on a 0.8% agarose gel, denatured, and transferred to NitroPure filters (MSI, Westboro, MA) by using a standard protocol (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The filters were hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled APEG-1 cDNA probes from the appropriate species (the cDNA probes contain exons 2 to 5). After hybridization, filters were washed at 55 °C in 0.2 × SSC (30 mm sodium chloride, 3 mm sodium citrate), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and exposed to Kodak BioMax films with intensifying screens. To locate APEG-1 on a specific human chromosome, we hybridized a genomic Southern blot membrane containing an EcoRI-digested human monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid panel (BIOS Laboratories, New Haven, CT) with a human APEG-1 cDNA probe under the same hybridization and washing conditions. A 129/SvJ mouse genomic library in λ FIX II vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened with a mouse APEG-1 cDNA probe. Four positive clones were purified and subcloned into pUC 18 (Promega, Madison, WI) or pBlueScript II SK (Stratagene) plasmid vectors. The genomic DNA and exon-intron junctions were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method with primers designed from the mouseAPEG-1 cDNA. Intron sizes were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with flanking exon primers, and by direct sequencing. The DNA sequences were assembled and analyzed with Sequencher 3.0 software (Gene Codes Co., Ann Arbor, MI) running on a PowerMacintosh (Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA). A 305-bp mouse APEG-1fragment (−122 to +183) was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using the forward primer 5′-CGTTCgagcTCCACCACTCCAGGG-3′ (the lowercase sequence indicates a SacI site introduced for cloning purposes) and the reverse primer 5′-GAGGCTTTGCACACGGAC-3′ and subcloned into the pCR-Script vector (Stratagene). After linearization this construct was used to produce an [α-32P]UTP-labeled antisense riboprobe with T3 RNA polymerase. Gel-purified antisense riboprobe was hybridized overnight with 20 μg of total RNA from mouse aorta, heart, or skeletal muscle. Yeast tRNA was also hybridized as a negative control. RNase A (0.1 unit) and RNase T1 (4 units) were added subsequently to digest single-strand RNA, and the remaining riboprobe was separated on an 8% sequencing gel along with a sequencing ladder using the linearized template and reverse primer. The gel was exposed to Kodak X-OMAT film overnight with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. A 5′ RACE system (Life Technologies, Inc., Manassas, VA) was used according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The nested primers were R592, 5′-CCATATTCGTTGACCGCC-3′ for reverse transcription; R354, 5′-TTGGGGGTGCCTTGGAAGAAGAGTC-3′ for the initial PCR; and R309, 5′-TGGGACTGAGCTTCATGGTAGGGGTTCGG-3′ for the nested PCR. One microgram of total RNA from mouse aorta was used. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) RNA and primers provided by the manufacturer were used as positive controls. The 5′ RACE product was cloned into the pCR-II vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for sequence analysis. A 2.7-kb mouse APEG-1 5′-flanking genomic sequence (bp −2663 to +76) was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the forward primer −2663 (5′-GCGATAGATAACCTGGTGATCC-3′) and the reverse primer +76 (5′-TCAGCCTGGCCAGCCCCACTCACTC-3′). The reporter plasmid p(−2663/+76) was made by inserting this 2.7-kb fragment into the SacI and SmaI sites of the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). Additional 5′-end deletion constructs were generated by PCR with the GL2 primer (Promega) and the following primers: −1073 (5′-CTGGAGCtcGGAATCTAAACTC-3′), −479 (5′-CCCTGAgAGcTCTTTGGTTCTC-3′), −355 (5′-GCTGaGCTcTATGGGTCAACAC-3′), and −122 (5′-CGTTCgagcTCCACCACTCCAGGG-3′). (The nucleotides in lowercase in each primer show mutations introduced for cloning purposes.) To generate 3′-deletion and mutation constructs, we paired the −479 or −122 forward primer with the +38 (5′-TGACCaAGCTtAGGCCCCGCAC-3′) or +76Emut (5′-ggcaagcttTCAGCCTGGCCAGCCCCACTCACTCGCTGACCgtGCTGAGGCCC-3′) reverse primer by PCR and subcloned the products into theSacI and HindIII sites of pGL3-Basic. The 3.3-kbAPEG-1 promoter construct p(−3336/+76) was generated by subcloning a 3.3-kb fragment of APEG-1 5′-flanking region (bp −3336 to +76) into the SacI and SmaI sites of pGL3-Basic. The reporter plasmid p(−3336/+76)Rev was made by digesting p(−3336/+76) with KpnI to invert a 1.5-kb DNA fragment (bp −3336 to −1813) within the plasmid. Each construct was confirmed by sequencing from both orientations. p(−2663/+76) and pGL3-Control (equal moles) were used to transfect growing cells on 60-mm dishes with DEAE-dextran for RASMC (20Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M.

To correct for variability in transfection efficiency, we co-transfected 1 μg of pCAT3-Control in all experiments. Luciferase and CAT activities were measured 48–60 h after transfection as described (20Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C. Hsieh C.-M. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Biol.

To compare APEG-1 promoter activity in different cell types, we expressed the normalized activity of p(−2663/+76) as a percentage of that of pGL3-Control. In the promoter deletion and mutation analyses, the normalized activity of each construct was expressed as a percentage of the activity of p(−2663/+76). All data are presented as the mean ± S.E. RASMC and NIH-3T3 nuclear extracts were prepared from cells grown on 150-mm dishes essentially as described (22Ritzenthaler J.D. Goldstein R.H. Fine A. Lichtler A. Rowe D.W. Smith B.D. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). C2C12 cells were grown in 10% fetal bovine serum then kept in 2% horse serum for 3 days to induce differentiation into myotubes. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford dye-binding method (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with the Bio-Rad protein assay system (Bio-Rad). For the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, oligonucleotide probes were synthesized according to the mouseAPEG-1 exon 1 sequences E (5′-GGGCCTCAGCTGGGTCAG-3′) and Emut (5′-GGGCCTCAGCacGGTCAG-3′). An 18-bp E box-containing probe was also synthesized according to the mouse muscle creatine kinase (MCK) enhancer sequence (5′-CCCCACACCTGCTGCCT-3′). An unrelated Oct-1 sequence (5′-TTATGCAAAATAATAAAACGTATT-3′) was made as a nonspecific competitor. Double-stranded oligonucleotide (50 pmol) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by using polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and purified on a Sephadex G-25 column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). A typical binding reaction consisted of 8 μg of nuclear extract, DNA probe (20,000 cpm), 250 ng of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. A molar excess (100-fold) of unlabeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide was added to the reaction to compete for DNA binding. For mobility supershift experiments, 4 μg of an anti-E2A protein (E12 and E47) monoclonal antibody (Yae antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was included in the binding reaction and incubated on ice for 20 min before the probe was added. Binding reactions were incubated on ice for 15 min and resolved by 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.5 × TBE buffer (44.5 mm Tris base, 44.5 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. We performed Southern analysis with a full-lengthAPEG-1 cDNA probe to determine whether APEG-1is a single-copy gene. Hybridization of EcoRI-,BamHI-, HindIII-, or SacI-digested genomic DNA from human, rat, and mouse revealed a simple pattern that suggests that APEG-1 is a single-copy gene in all three species (Fig. 1 A). To test the possibility that APEG-1 associates with certain genetic disorders that have been mapped, we determined the chromosomal location of the human APEG-1 gene. Southern hybridization to an EcoRI-digested human/rodent monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid panel revealed that APEG-1 is located on human chromosome 2 (Fig. 1 B). This result was confirmed by using an independent human/rodent somatic cell hybrid panel (data not shown). To determine the subchromosomal localization of human APEG-1, we carried out a genomic PCR analysis by using the GeneBridge 4 radiation hybrid panel with specific primers from the human APEG-1 cDNA sequence (24Walter M.A. Spillett D.J. Thomas P. Weissenbach J. Goodfellow P.N. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The PCR results were then screened against a sequence-tagged site data base for the human genome (25Dib C. Faure S. Fizames C. Samson D. Drouot N. Vignal A. Millasseau P. Marc S. Hazan J. Seboun E. Lathrop M. Gyapay G. Morissette J. Weissenbach J. Nature. 1996; 380: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (2730) Google Scholar). APEG-1 mapped to human chromosome 2q34 between markers D2S360 and D2S353 (data not shown). Despite the preferential expression of APEG-1 in VSMC, a search of the human genome data base did not reveal an association with known inherited vascular diseases or with a particular gene cluster (26McKusick V.A. Center for Medical Genetics. Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD) and National Center for Bio/Technology Information, National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD1997Google Scholar). Using a full-length mouse APEG-1 cDNA probe, we identified several clones from a 129/SvJ mouse genomic library. TheseAPEG-1 genomic sequences assembled into a 4.5-kb organization that contained five exons and four introns (Fig.2, A and B). The open reading frame for the APEG-1 protein began in the second exon and terminated at the 5′-end of the fifth exon (Fig.2 B). The identified exon-intron junctions (Fig.2 B) were all in agreement with the consensus 5′ GT and 3′ AG sequences (27Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar). To determine the APEG-1 transcription start site, we performed RNase protection assays. A 305-bp (−122 to +183) APEG-1antisense riboprobe encompassing the 5′-untranscribed region and most of the first exon was hybridized with RNA from mouse aorta, brain, heart, and undifferentiated and differentiated Monc-1 cells (Monc-1 cells are transformed neural crest cells that can be differentiated into VSMC) (18Jain M.K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Chin M.T. Feinberg M.W. Sibinga N.E. Hsieh C.-M. Yet S.-F. Stemple D.L. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5993-5996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). After RNase digestion (Fig.3 A), three partially protected riboprobe signals of between 100 and 200 nucleotides were observed primarily in the mouse aorta and to a lesser extent in the heart and the differentiated Monc-1 cells (28 and 57% compared with aorta, respectively). Very little signal was seen in the brain (12%) and the undifferentiated Monc-1 cells (11%). The most 5′ transcription start site (Fig. 3 A, long arrow) for mouseAPEG-1 mapped to a CA nucleotide pair (Fig. 3 A,bent arrow), which is found at many eukaryotic transcription start sites (28Bucher P. Trifonov E.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 10009-10026Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Two shorter fragments (Fig. 3 A,arrowheads) corresponded to downstream CA pairs and may also be transcription start sites. In addition, a fully protected riboprobe (minus sequence from the vector) was found in the aorta, brain, heart, and differentiated Monc-1 cells (Fig. 3 A,asterisk). This fully protected probe was generated by a 4-kb APEG-1isoform. 2C.-M. Hsieh and M.-E. Lee, unpublished data. To confirm the transcription start site of APEG-1, we performed a 5′ RACE experiment. We amplified and cloned a 363-bp cDNA fragment from mouse aortic RNA (Fig. 3 B). After we had removed sequences introduced by the 5′ RACE procedure, this 363-bp product contained a 309-bp APEG-1 cDNA sequence whose 5′ end (Fig. 3 C, bent arrow) was the same as the primary transcription start site (Fig. 3 A, long arrow) identified by the RNase protection assays. To identify potentialcis-acting elements that may be important in the regulation of APEG-1 promoter activity, we cloned and sequenced the 3.3-kb 5′-flanking region (Fig. 4). There are no upstream TATA-like sequences in the APEG-15′-flanking sequence; however, there is a consensus initiator motif (5′-YYCAYYYYY-3′) at the APEG-1 transcription start site (Figs. 3 A and 4, bent arrow) (29Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 30Weis L. Reinberg D. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). We identified several cis-acting elements (by their consensus sequences) that have the potential to regulate APEG-1promoter activity (Fig. 4). Among them are two CArG (or CArG-like) elements known to regulate expression of SMC-specific genes (13Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar,31Herring B.P. Smith A.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1394-C1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S.

Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6332-6340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, we identified two Sp1 sites in the proximal promoter region (bp −52 and bp −143 relative to the transcription start site) that may potentiate transcription from the TATA-lessAPEG-1 promoter (34Smale S.T. Schmidt M.C. Berk A.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). To see whether the APEG-1 5′-flanking sequence contains a VSMC-specific promoter, we constructed the reporter plasmid p(−2663/+76) by cloning a 2.7-kb APEG-1 5′-flanking region and 76 bp of exon 1 into the pGL3-Basic vector. In VSMC (RASMC), the 2.7-kb APEG-1 5′-flanking region directed a high level of promoter activity that was similar (86%) to the activity of pGL3-Control, which contains the potent SV40 promoter/enhancer (Fig.5). In contrast, this 2.7-kbAPEG-1 sequence directed low levels of promoter activity in the five other non-SMC that we tested (bovine aortic endothelial cells, HeLa, U-2 OS, NIH 3T3, and HepG2). Thus, the 2.7-kb APEG-15′-flanking region contains potent VSMC-specific promoter activity. We reported elsewhere that expression of APEG-1 is down-regulated in de-differentiated VSMC both in vivo andin vitro (15Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Endege W.O. Kho C.-J. Jain M.K. Kashiki S. delos Santos R. Lee W.-S. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17354-17359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus although we had expected VSMC-specificAPEG-1 promoter activity, we were surprised that 2.7 kb of the APEG-1 5′-flanking region directed high levels of promoter activity in cultured, and therefore de-differentiated, RASMC. One explanation for this discrepancy would be the presence of negative DNA regulatory elements outside the 2.7-kb APEG-15′-flanking sequence. To test this possibility, we constructed p(−3336/+76) and p(−3336/+76)Rev by cloning an additional 685 bp ofAPEG-1 5′-flanking sequence into p(−2663/+76) in both orientations. In comparison with that of p(−2663/+76), the promoter activity of p(−3336/+76) and p(−3336/+76)Rev was reduced markedly (Fig. 6). An additional (upstream) 4-kb DNA sequence did not decrease promoter activity further (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that an orientation-independent transcription repressor is located between bp −3336 and −2663 5′ of the APEG-1 transcription start site. This APEG-1 transcriptional repressor may explain, at least in part, the decrease in expression of APEG-1 in dedifferentiated VSMC (15Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Endege W.O. Kho C.-J. Jain M.K. Kashiki S. delos Santos R. Lee W.-S. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17354-17359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To identify the cis-acting element in theAPEG-1 promoter responsible for its potent activity in RASMC, we made three deletion constructs from the 5′ end of p(−2663/+76). In transient transfection experiments, the three deletion constructs, p(−1073/+76), p(−479/+76), and p(−355/+76), had promoter activity similar to that of p(−2663/+76). A fourth deletion construct, p(−122/+76), showed a 20% reduction in promoter activity (Fig. 7). These data suggest that most of the APEG-1 promoter activity is contained between bp −122 and +76. To further localize the positive cis-acting element, we generated a series of 3′ deletion constructs based on p(−479/+76) and p(−122/+76). These allowed us to determine whether the presence of the 76-bp exon 1 sequence was important for promoter activity. In comparison with p(−479/+76), p(−479/+38), and p(−122/+38) both had much lower promoter activity (16 and 4%, respectively) (Fig. 7). These results indicated that the sequence between bp +38 and +76 in exon 1 was essential for APEG-1 promoter activity. When we inspected the sequence between bp +38 and +76 for potential transcription factor-binding sites, we identified an E box motif (CAGCTG) at bp +39 to +44 (Fig. 4). To determine the importance of this E box motif, we mutated its sequence from CAGCTG to CAGCAC in p(−479/+76) and p(−122/+76). As demonstrated by transfection experiments with p(−479/+76)Emut and p(−122/+76)Emut, mutation of the exon 1 E box motif caused a dramatic reduction in APEG-1promoter activity (Fig. 7). These data indicate that this E box motif located at the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) is essential for high level APEG-1 promoter activity in RASMC. Although not commonly found, transcription regulatory elements have been documented to locate to the 5′-UTR of a few other genes (35Amrolia P.J. Cunningham J.M. Ney P. Nienhuis A.W. Jane S.M. J.

For instance, the 5′-UTR of the herpes simplex virus type 1 ICP22 gene and the human integrin β3 gene contain cis-acting elements that mediate high level expression of these genes (36Greco A. Simonin D. Diaz J.J. Barjhoux L. Kindbeiter K. Madjar J.J. Masse T. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 1693-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 37Wilhide C.C. Jin Y. Guo Q. Li L. Li S.X. Rubin E. Bray P.F. Blood. 1997; 90: 3951-3961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the human Aγ-globin gene also has regulatory elements in the 5′-UTR. One of these elements binds to the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 and may regulate transcription of the humanAγ-globin gene during development (35Amrolia P.J. Cunningham J.M. Ney P. Nienhuis A.W. Jane S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12892-12898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that one CArG box and one CArG-like box are located at bp −1531 to −1522 and bp −443 to −434 of the APEG-15′-flanking region, respectively (Fig. 4). The CArG box is crucial to the expression of several other SMC-specific genes (13Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 31Herring B.P. Smith A.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1394-C1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S.

In the case of the APEG-1 promoter, however, deletion of the CArG and CArG-like boxes did not alter its activity (Fig. 7), indicating that the two boxes are dispensable. This dispensability distinguishes APEG-1 from other SMC-specific genes and suggests the existence of CArG-independent mechanisms of SMC-specific gene expression. Indeed, we have shown that the CArG-less promoter of mouse CRP2/SmLIM directs a high level of VSMC-specific reporter gene expression in transgenic mice (38Yet S.-F. Folta S.C. Jain M.K. Hsieh C.-M.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4344-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the ubiquitously expressed E2A gene products E12 and E47 (46Roberts V.J. Steenbergen R. Murre C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7583-7587Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) heterodimerize with tissue-specific transcription factors to regulate gene expression via the E box motif (47Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar), although an E47 or E12 heterodimerization partner has not been identified in VSMC. We therefore wanted to determine by electrophoretic mobility shift assay whether the APEG-1 exon-1 E box was bound by nuclear protein prepared from VSMC, and whether E12 and E47 were present in the binding complex. Incubation of a probe containing the APEG-1 E box (E) but not one containing a mutated E box (Emut) with RASMC nuclear extract resulted in a DNA-protein complex (Fig.8 A). This DNA-protein complex was specific because only an excessive amount (100-fold) of unlabeled E box oligonucleotide could compete with it for binding (Fig.8 A); the mutated E box oligonucleotide and an unrelated Oct-1 oligonucleotide could not compete with it. To see if E47 or E12 was present in the DNA-protein complex, we performed mobility shift assays with the Yae monoclonal antibody specific to E47 and E12 (48Jacobs Y. Vierra C. Nelson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7321-7333Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Addition of the Yae antibody to the binding reaction did not, however, cause a mobility supershift or a disappearance of the DNA-protein complex (Fig. 8 B). As a positive control, we used another E box-containing mouse enhancer sequence, MCK , and nuclear proteins extracted from differentiated C2C12 myotubes (48Jacobs Y. Vierra C. Nelson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7321-7333Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The Yae antibody was able to supershift a distinct binding complex in C2C12 myotubes which is presumably composed of heterodimeric E2A proteins and MyoD or myogenin (Fig. 8 B). These results indicate that the E12 and E47 proteins are not present in the APEG-1 E box-binding protein complex. We next tested the specificity of the APEG-1 E box-binding protein in two additional cell types and found that the same binding complex also existed in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and C2C12 myotubes (Fig.8 C). This result and the deletion/mutation analyses of theAPEG-1 promoter by transfection experiments would suggest that the E box is essential for APEG-1 promoter activity but not sufficient to confer SMC specificity. A similar scenario is found in CArG box-mediated SMC-specific gene expression (13Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 31Herring B.P. Smith A.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1394-C1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S.

By electrophoretic mobility shift assay, the CArG box is bound by serum response factor, whose expression is not cell type restricted. Thus, it appears that additional SMC-specific accessory factors may be required to interact with either the APEG-1 E box-binding protein or serum response factor to direct SMC specific transcription. Although the APEG-1 E box and the MCK E box share the same MyoD-type E box (49Blackwell T.K. Huang J. Ma A. Kretzner L. Alt F.W. Eisenman R.N. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), they formed distinct DNA-protein complexes when incubated with nuclear extracts of RASMC or C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 8, B and C). For example, incubation of RASMC nuclear extracts resulted in a more prominent DNA-protein complex with the APEG-1 E box than theMCK E box. Furthermore, an E2A-containing complex was present when C2C12 nuclear extracts were incubated with theMCK but not APEG-1 E box. These observations indicate that additional E box-flanking sequences are required to determine the binding preferences of different nuclear proteins in the same cell type, which may contribute to cell type-specific gene expression. We cloned (in both orientations) a 74-bp exon 1 sequence (+2 to +76) containing the APEG-1 E box upstream of the SV40 promoter in pGL3-Promoter. The resulting plasmids pGL3-E1Ebox and pGL3-E1Ebox.Rev were then transfected into several cell types. The SV40 enhancer in pGL3-Control (positive control) increased SV40 promoter activity in all cell types tested (Fig.9). Only in RASMC, in contrast, did theAPEG-1 E box and its flanking sequence (in either orientation) increase SV40 promoter activity markedly (Fig. 9). These findings indicate that the E box motif and its flanking sequence are both necessary and sufficient for a VSMC-specific enhancer. To our knowledge, this work on the APEG-1 promoter is the first demonstration that an E box plays an important role in VSMC-specific gene transcription. Future studies to identify thetrans-acting factors responsible for E box-dependent APEG-1 promoter activity and down-regulation of promoter activity by VSMC de-differentiation will contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating VSMC-specific gene expression and phenotypic modulation.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5877-5886Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). GT modification of incompletely folded proteins involves interaction with both polypeptide and glycan determinants, including recognition of hydrophobic amino acids and interestingly, the innermost GlcNAc residue of the glycan chain (the site of attachment of oligosaccharide to protein) (15Sousa M.C. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Both recognition elements must be covalently linked to effectively catalyze Glc transfer (15Sousa M.C. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and accessible to GT modification, which for certain glycoproteins may be concealed by molecular chaperone association in vivo, particularly under conditions of extreme ER stress (14Fernandez F. Alessio C.D. Fanchiotti S. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5877-5886Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The size of the glycan chain,e.g. the oligomannose core, is also important for the efficiency of reglucosylation; Man8–9GlcNAc2glycans are reglucosylated much more effectively than shorter Man5–7GlcNAc2 glycans (12Sousa M.C. Ferrero-Garcia M.A. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 16Van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4179-4186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As recently demonstrated in mutant BW cell types synthesizing truncated Glc3Man5GlcNAc2 N-glycans, TCRα molecules having shortened oligosaccharides were reglucosylated much less efficiently than TCRα molecules having normal size glycans, which was correlated with TCRα instability (16Van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4179-4186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To evaluate the folding status of TCR glycoproteins as a function of their assembly into multisubunit complexes in the ER, we studied the GT modification of TCR proteins in 2B4 T hybridoma cells. These studies show that all TCR subunits bearing N-glycan chains were modified by GT and that TCR proteins were differentially reglucosylated during their assembly into multisubunit complexes. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that reglucosylation of most TCR subunits was extinguished following CD3αβ assembly and formation of CD3-associated disulfide-linked αβ heterodimers, indicating that TCR folding is finalized convergent with formation of αβδεγε complexes. 2B4 T hybridoma cells and the TCRβ-deficient 2B4 variant 21.2.2 were maintained by weekly passage in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 (17Hedrick S.M.

Klausner R.D. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 3254-3258PubMed Google Scholar). Deoxymannojirimycin (dmj) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and was used at a final concentration of 75 μg/ml. Metabolic pulse-labeling with [3H]galactose was performed as described previously (16Van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4179-4186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in glucose-free RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 5 mm sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1 mm cycloheximide (chx) for 3 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2; cells were centrifuged and resuspended in similar medium containing 0.5 mCi/ml ([6-3H]galactose) (ICN, Irvine, CA) and labeled for 15–45 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Effectiveness of chx treatment in blocking new protein synthesis was verified by parallel experiments using [35S]methionine (data not shown). In experiments using dmj, cells were cultured overnight in medium containing 75 μg/ml dmj at 37 °C in 5% CO2; cell viability was identical in medium- and dmj-treated cultures (data not shown). Biotinylation of cell surface proteins was performed as described previously (24Wu W. Harley P.H. Punt J. Sharrow S.O. Kearse K.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 759-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cells were solubilized in 1% digitonin (Wako, Kyoto, Japan) lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mmNaCl, plus protease inhibitors) at 1 × 108 cells/ml for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation to remove insoluble material and immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibodies preabsorbed to protein A-Sepharose beads as described previously (16Van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4179-4186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Sequential immunoprecipitation, one- and two-dimensional SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting were performed according to previously published methods (16Van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4179-4186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Munitz T.I. Wiest D.L. Nakayama T. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4504-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recently we examined the reglucosylation of unassembled TCRα and -β proteins in BW thymoma cells using [3H]galactose as a radioactive tracer of Glc residues (16Van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4179-4186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here we extended these studies in 2B4 T hybridoma cells to approximate at which stage(s) of TCR complex formation folding of individual TCR glycoproteins is completed, with the rationale that GT modification (reglucosylation) will cease upon attainment of proper conformation. As shown in Fig.1, [3H]galactose may be incorporated into N-linked oligosaccharides on glycoproteins via three major pathways: (i) conversion into UDP-[3H]galactose, the sugar donor for galactosyltransferase enzymes that transfer galactose residues to mature, complex-type oligosaccharides in the trans-Golgi; (ii) epimerization of UDP-[3H]galactose to UDP-[3H]glucose, the sugar donor for GT that transfers Glc residues to high mannose glycans on incompletely folded glycoproteins in the ER; and (iii) conversion of UDP-[3H]glucose into dolichol-phospho[3H]glucose, which is incorporated into nascent Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 glycans that are cotranslationally added to newly synthesized polypeptides in the ER (Fig. 1) (16Van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4179-4186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Hubbard S.C. Robbins P.W. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 16-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the current study, cycloheximide was included in all experiments to inhibit incorporation of [3H]glucose into newly translated proteins, thereby restricting radiolabeling to galactosylation and reglucosylation routes (Fig. 1) (16Van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4179-4186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 2B4 T hybridoma cells were used, which have served as a model cell type for TCR assembly in numerous studies (1Klausner R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bonifacino J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 54: 403-431Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, multiple TCR subunits were detected in anti-CD3ε precipitates of [3H]galactose-labeled 2B4 T cells, including CD3δ and -γ glycoproteins and clonotypic TCRα and -β proteins (Fig.2 A); as expected, nonglycosylated CD3ε and TCRζ molecules were not visualized (Fig. 2 A). Because anti-CD3ε precipitates contain a mixture of TCR components at various stages of their assembly superimposed upon one another, sequential precipitation techniques were used to separate more completely assembled TCR proteins (capable of becoming galactosylated in the Golgi) from partially assembled and unassembled TCR subunits (retained in the ER) (25Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Munitz T.I. Wiest D.L. Nakayama T. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4504-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As demonstrated, when supernatants from anti-CD3ε precipitates were sequentially precipitated with anti-TCRβ mAb, radiolabeled TCRβ proteins were detected (Fig. 2 A), representing unassembled TCRβ proteins modified via the reglucosylation pathway. Consistent with incorporation of [3H]glucose into glycan chains on ER-localized TCRβ proteins, the radioactive signal on reglucosylated TCRβ proteins was sensitive to digestion with endoglycosidase H (EH), specific for immature oligosaccharides (data not shown). The vast majority of radiolabeled CD3γ glycoproteins associated with CD3ε were not simultaneously assembled with TCRβ but existed in partial complexes of CD3γε components (Fig. 2 A, anti-TCRβ → anti-CD3ε precipitates, respectively), indicating that most radiolabeled CD3γ chains associated with CD3ε were modified by GT. More than half of the CD3ε-associated CD3δ chains were assembled with TCRβ (Fig. 2 A), with remaining CD3δ proteins existing in partial δε complexes containing reglucosylatedN-glycans; unassembled CD3δ glycoproteins were also modified by GT as shown by sequential immunoprecipitation of anti-CD3ε precipitates with anti-CD3δ Ab to capture “free,” unassembled CD3δ chains (Fig. 2 A). Reglucosylation of partially assembled and free CD3γ and -δ glycoproteins was verified in 21.2.2 cells (Fig. 2 B), a TCRβ-deficient 2B4 variant that cannot assemble CD3 chains into a form capable of ER exit (29Bonifacino J.S. Chen C. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Ashwell J.D. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 35: 6929-6933Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Similar to our results in parental 2B4 cells, significantly more radiolabeled CD3γ proteins were associated with CD3ε than CD3δ proteins in 21.2.2 cells (Fig. 2 B). In agreement with previous studies showing that nascent glycoproteins undergo multiple cycles of deglucosylation and reglucosylation in the ER (9Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 16Van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4179-4186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), Glc residues did not persist on CD3ε-associated γ proteins in 21.2.2 cells (Fig. 2 C), and CD3γ proteins were effectively radiolabeled during a secondary pulse period with [3H]galactose (Fig. 2 C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that glycosylated TCR subunits were substrates for GT, including invariant CD3γ and -δ molecules and clonotypic TCRβ proteins. In addition, these data show that both “free” and assembled CD3γ and -δ proteins contained reglucosylated glycans. To determine the contribution of reglucosylation in [3H]galactose radiolabeling of TCR proteins, studies were performed using the mannosidase inhibitor dmj, which precludes conversion of immature, high mannose glycans to mature (galactosylated) glycans in the Golgi (30Elbein A.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 497-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); thus, only reglucosylated glycoproteins are visualized in such experiments (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig.3 A, markedly fewer radiolabeled TCR proteins were present in anti-TCRα (A2B4) immunoprecipitates of dmj-treated cells relative to media-treated cells with TCRβ and CD3γ and -δ chains being completely absent and only TCRα proteins detected (Fig. 3 A). Consistent with restriction of radiolabeling to immature N-glycans, TCRα proteins in dmj lysates migrated with increased mobility compared with TCRα proteins from control lysates (Fig. 3 A) and unlike control TCRα molecules, disappeared completely following EH digestion (Fig. 3 A). Note that increased mobility of EH-digested TCRα-associated TCRβ proteins in control lysates results from the fact that several N-glycans on TCRβ proteins remain in the immature high mannose form, even on surface-expressed molecules, which is also true for CD3δ proteins (31, 32 and see below). Interestingly, increased amounts of reglucosylated (unassembled) TCRβ proteins existed in dmj lysates relative to control lysates (Fig.3 A), which was accompanied by augmented survival of newly synthesized TCRβ proteins. 2K. P. Kearse, unpublished observations. These results were specific in that the half-life and reglucosylation of unassembled TCRα molecules were relatively unaffected; similar results were observed in BW thymoma cells (data not shown). Biochemical analysis of surface-labeled molecules showed that the vast majority of TCR glycoproteins expressed on dmj-treated cells contained immature, EH-sensitive oligosaccharides (Fig. 3 B), demonstrating the effectiveness of dmj in blocking maturation ofN-oligosaccharides in these studies and showing that dmj treatment did not perturb TCR assembly. Taken together, these results show that most radiolabeled TCRβ and CD3γ and -δ glycoproteins associated with 2B4 TCRα represent galactosylated species and not reglucosylated TCR molecules. We conclude that TCRβ proteins assembled into TCRα and -β heterodimers are ineffectively modified by GT (and thus no longer perceived by the ER quality control system as incompletely folded) and relatedly, that reglucosylation of TCRβ and CD3γ and -δ proteins is terminated following their association with TCRα molecules. In addition, these data show that inhibition of mannosidase activity resulted in enhanced reglucosylation of unassembled TCRβ proteins. Assembly of TCRα and -β proteins into disulfide-linked heterodimers is preceded by the association of monomeric TCRα and TCRβ proteins with CD3 components in the form of αδε and βγε intermediates, which join to form αβδεγε complexes (3Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Singer A. Immunity. 1995; 2: 391-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, we next wished to determine whether CD3-associated TCRα and -β proteins were modified by GT. As shown in Fig. 4, both monomeric and dimeric radiolabeled TCRα and -β proteins were detected in association with CD3 chains in lysates of [3H]galactose-labeled 2B4 T cells (Fig. 4). Because monomeric TCRα and -β proteins are restricted to the ER (1Klausner R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bonifacino J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 54: 403-431Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 3Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Singer A. Immunity. 1995; 2: 391-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), these data indicate that reglucosylated (incompletely folded) TCRα and -β proteins exist in association with CD3 in 2B4 T cells, most likely as CD3α and CD3β intermediates because our previous results showed that few, if any, reglucosylated TCRβ proteins were associated with TCRα chains. To determine the contribution of GT modification to [3H]galactose radiolabeling of CD3-associated TCRα and -β proteins, dmj treatment was utilized to restrict radiolabeling to the reglucosylation pathway as before. In agreement with our previous findings that CD3γ and -δ glycoproteins assembled into partial δε, γε complexes were modified by GT, CD3γ and -δ chains were effectively labeled in dmj-treated cells (Fig.5 A). As noted earlier, reglucosylation of unassembled TCRβ chains, captured in sequential precipitates with anti-TCRβ mAb, was enhanced in dmj-treated cells relative to media-treated cells (Fig. 5 A). Importantly, these data show that reduced amounts of TCRα and -β proteins were associated with CD3 chains in dmj-treated cells compared with media-treated cells (Fig. 5 A), which was expected as our previous results showed that a significant portion of radiolabeled TCRα and -β proteins were assembled into disulfide-linked heterodimers modified by galactosylation. Analysis on two-dimensional nonreducing × reducing (NR × R) gels showed that relatively few radiolabeled TCRα and -β dimers were detected in anti-CD3 precipitates of dmj-treated cells (Fig. 5 B), unlike CD3 chains, which were readily visible (Fig. 5 B). Interestingly, radiolabeled TCRα proteins existed as both disulfide-linked and monomeric species whereas the vast majority of TCRβ molecules were present as non-disulfide-linked monomers (Fig. 5 B). Formation of TCRα and -β heterodimers was not precluded in dmj-treated cells as shown by immunoblotting of CD3 precipitates with anti-TCRα mAb (Fig. 6); dimeric TCRα proteins in media-treated groups existed as two species: an upper band representing mature (EH-resistant) proteins and a lower band migrating parallel with non-disulfide-linked TCRα monomers containing immature (EH-sensitive) glycans (Fig. 6). As demonstrated, only immature TCRα proteins were present in lysates of dmj-treated cells (Fig. 6). These results corroborate our previous findings that TCRβ subunits associated with TCRα proteins were ineffectively modified by GT and that reglucosylated (incompletely folded) CD3-associated monomeric TCRα and -β proteins exist in normal (untreated) cells. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that reglucosylation of most TCR components is extinguished following the CD3α and -β assembly and formation of disulfide-linked TCRα and -β heterodimers, indicating that TCR folding is finalized convergent with formation of αβδεγε complexes.Figure 5Reglucosylated TCR α and -β proteins are assembled with CD3 components in 2B4 T cells.

The data in the current report significantly extend previous studies on TCR processing in splenic T lymphocytes, which showed that significant Glc trimming of newly synthesized CD3δ and TCRα glycoproteins takes place prior to association with partner TCR chains (33Van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9660-9665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), based on their comigration with calnexin-associated glycoforms following digestion with jack bean α-mannosidase. Indeed, the current study utilizes a sensitive radiolabeling method which specifically identifies TCR subunits containing monoglucosylatedN-glycans generated via the reglucosylation pathway. The current report establishes that all TCR subunits containingN-glycans are substrates for GT and evaluated reglucosylation as a function of TCR assembly, previously examined only on unassembled TCRα and -β proteins expressed in BW thymoma cells, which do not efficiently assemble TCR complexes due to deficient CD3δ synthesis (16Van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4179-4186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The results in this study suggest a scheme in which reglucosylation of invariant CD3γ and -δ subunits persists until their association with clonotypic TCRα and -β chains, and GT modification of TCRβ proteins is terminated following the assembly of αβδεγε complexes and formation of disulfide-linked TCRα and -β heterodimers. Interestingly, unlike CD3-associated TCRβ molecules, which were ineffectively modified by GT following disulfide linkage with TCRα proteins, reglucosylated TCRα molecules existed as both CD3-associated monomers and dimers. Although the exact significance of these findings remain to be determined, these data suggest that folding of TCRα may be one of the final steps of ER quality control that precedes TCR egress to the Golgi. It is conceivable that folding of the TCR complex occurs concomitant with the ordered assembly of TCR subunits and that GT recognition motifs become progressively “masked” as TCR oligomerization proceeds, similar to ER retention and lysosomal targeting information contained within the polypeptide sequences of certain TCR subunits (1Klausner R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bonifacino J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 54: 403-431Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 34Bonifacino J.S. Cosson P. Klausner R.D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26281-26284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, the results in the current study provide evidence that most TCR glycoproteins are no longer perceived by the ER quality control system as incompletely folded following the assembly of αβδεγε TCR complexes, which, interestingly, is the stage at which TCR complexes become competent for ER exit. It is possible that reglucosylation of higher ordered TCR complexes ceases due to relocalization from the ER to the Golgi complex; however, we favor the idea that assembly, folding, and intracellular transport of TCR proteins are closely coupled events, similar to what has been observed for other multimeric immune protein complexes, i.e. major histocompatibility complex molecules (37Cresswell P. Cell. 1996; 84: 505-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 38Solheim J. Carreno B.M. Hansen T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 541-543PubMed Google Scholar, 39Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Indeed, previous studies have demonstrated that protein reglucosylation is not static but proceeds in a rapid, cyclic fashion in concert with Glc removal by glucosidase II enzymes (9Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar,16Van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4179-4186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that reglucosylation of “free” TCRβ proteins was increased under conditions of mannosidase blockade, which was specific in that GT modification of TCRα proteins was relatively unaffected.2 Because the efficiency of GT modification is inversely correlated with N-glycan chain length (12Sousa M.C. Ferrero-Garcia M.A. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 16Van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4179-4186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and dmj inhibits the activity of certain ER mannosidase enzymes (40Weng S. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25656-25663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,41Weng S. Spiro R.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it is reasonable that increased reglucosylation of unassembled TCRβ proteins in dmj-treated cells results from persistence of Man residues on N-glycan chains. However, it was also noted that the stability of newly synthesized TCRβ molecules was enhanced under these conditions, similar to what has been described for CD3δ proteins by Weissman and colleagues (6Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Thus, the relationship between increased reglucosylation and increased survival of TCR proteins under conditions of mannosidase blockade remains to be determined. Moreover, despite the fact that GT modification of certain TCR subunits was enhanced by prevention of Man removal, relatively few reglucosylated TCR proteins assembled into higher ordered TCR complexes were detected under these conditions, indicating that GT modification (folding) of TCR subunits is tightly regulated. Finally, it is unknown to what extent specific N-glycans on TCR proteins containing multiple oligosaccharides may be differentially modified by GT enzymes. Recent studies by Dessen et al. (42Dessen A. Gupta D. Sabewsan S. Brewer C.F. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4933-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) demonstrate that N-acetylglucosamine residues interact with neighboring amino acids of proteins in native conformations, which may be one of the major mechanisms by which GT modification of newly synthesized proteins is regulated (14Fernandez F. Alessio C.D. Fanchiotti S. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5877-5886Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 43Fanchiotti S. Fernandez F. Alessio C.D. Parodi A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The data in the current report suggest that determinants that signify malfolded molecules may persist on TCRα proteins compared with other TCR subunits, an idea that is consistent with previous findings that TCRα survival is uniquely sensitive to perturbations in the ER quality control system (16Van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4179-4186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Suh K. Bergmann J.E. Gabel C.A. J.

Therefore, the cardiac energy metabolizing pathways must be properly established and efficiently functioning. While the biochemistry of these pathways is well defined, limited information regarding the regulation of cardiac metabolic genes is available. Previously, we reported that 1.9 kilobase pairs of murine adenylosuccinate synthetase 1 gene (Adss1) 5′-flanking DNA directs high levels of reporter expression to the adult transgenic heart. In this report, we define the 1.9-kilobase pair fragment as a cardiac-specific enhancer that controls correct spatiotemporal expression of a reporter similar to the endogenousAdss1 gene. A 700-base pair fragment within this region activates a heterologous promoter specifically in adult transgenic hearts. Proteins present in a cardiac nuclear extract interact with potential transcription factor binding sites of this region and thesecis-acting sites play important regulatory roles in the cardiac expression of this reporter.

Several genes that encode metabolic enzymes are activated at low levels during early cardiogenesis, then are up-regulated around birth to reach adult levels during postnatal development to deal with the increasing cardiac energy demands (2Keller A. Ott M.-O. Lamande N. Lucas M. Gros F. Buckingham M. Lazar M. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 3Lyons G.E. Muhlebach S. Moser A. Masood R. Paterson B.M. Buckingham M.E. Perriard J.-C. Development (Camb.). 1991; 113: 1017-1029PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous metabolic pathways also utilize cardiac-specific isozymes that are present at high levels in the heart (4Guicherit O.M. Rudolph F.B. Kellems R.E. Cooper B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22582-22587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Jaynes J.B. Johnson J.E. Buskin J.N. Gartside C.L. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell.

Although the biochemistry of cardiac metabolism is well defined, the genetic signaling pathways that control expression of the cardiac metabolic genes are not well understood. Few cardiac cis-regulatory elements that function in vivo have been identified and preliminary studies are just beginning to describe transcription factor interactions as genetic regulatory mechanisms. The subset of cardiac regulatory regions that has received the most attention has been those that control contractile gene transcription (7Subramaniam A. Gulick J. Neumann J. Knotts S. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4331-4336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rindt H. Knotts S. Robbins J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Two of the best characterized cardiac structural gene enhancer and promoter regions regulate the α- and β-myosin heavy chain genes, which have been used to direct expression of several other genes to the murine heart (10Colbert M.C. Hall D.G. Kimball T.R. Witt S.A. Lorenz J.N. Kirby M.L. Hewett T.E. Klevitsky R. Robbins J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1958-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Gulick J. Hewett T.E.

Less well characterized cardiac structural gene enhancers include those that control expression of the myosin light chain 1/3 (13McGrew M.J. Bogdanova N. Hasegawa K. Hughes S.H. Kitsis R.N. Rosenthal N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4524-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and 2v genes (14Lee K.J. Hickey R. Zhu H. Chien K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1220-1229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another class of cardiac elements, those regulating genes that encode enzymes of energy metabolism, is the least understood group of cardiac regulatory regions. Since the murine linear heart tube begins to beat early in development (1Fishman M.C. Chien K.R. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 2099-2117PubMed Google Scholar), these energy metabolizing pathways must be well established during cardiac formation and morphogenesis. Synthesis and control of the metabolic enzymes that provide the massive supply of energy to the constantly beating heart are areas of study that can provide further information about the molecular pathways controlling heart development and function. Analysis of only two cardiac metabolic gene flanking regions by the transgenic assay, specifically those regulating the transcription of the creatine kinase (15Donoviel D.B. Shield M.A. Buskin J.N.

Consequently, characterization of several energy metabolic regulatory regions is necessary and a comparison of the metabolic versus the structural cardiac enhancers will help to define the mechanisms of tissue-specific activation and enhancement. We chose to study the adenylosuccinate synthetase 1 (Adss1) gene to characterize further heart-specific cis-acting control elements and to analyze trans-regulatory mechanisms. ADSS1, a striated-muscle specific energy metabolic enzyme, is a member of the purine nucleotide cycle (PNC), which regulates adenine nucleotide pool levels during periods of increased workload. During intense muscle contraction, the forward myokinase and AMP deaminase reactions generate additional ATP. When the myocyte recovers, ADSS1 and ADSL restore adenine nucleotide levels (18Stayton M.M. Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1983; 22: 103-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The PNC may support energy metabolism differently in the heart. We propose that this cycle is activated under hypoxic conditions when oxidative phosphorylation pathways cannot function efficiently. The PNC generates additional ATP, while cycle intermediates positively regulate anaerobic glycolysis for substrate level phosphorylation. When oxygen levels return to normal, the return pathway of the PNC restores adenine nucleotide levels. Previously, we showed that 1.9 kb of Adss1 5′-flanking DNA can direct high levels of reporter gene expression to the adult transgenic mouse heart (19Lewis A.L. Guicherit O.M. Datta S.K. Hanten G.R. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22647-22656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we report that thisAdss1 1.9-kb fragment regulates reporter expression in transgenic hearts similar to the endogenous Adss1 gene. This cardiac enhancer directs copy number-dependent, integration site-independent expression to the hearts of transgenic mice at levels comparable with the endogenous gene. Also, a 700-bp fragment within the 1.9-kb 5′-flanking fragment activates a heterologous promoter specifically in transgenic hearts. This region contains a cluster of potential cardiac transcription factors that specifically bind proteins from a cardiac nuclear extract. Using mutational analyses, we show that these transcription factor binding sites play important regulatory roles in cardiac reporter gene expression. Finally, we report that several cardiac transcription factors trans-activate 1.9HSCAT expression in a noncardiac background specifically through these sites. Combinations of transcription factors lead to enhanced reporter expression. These results are the first to identify a potential target gene for the cardiac bHLH factors, Hand1 and Hand2. In situ hybridization to sections was performed as described (20$$Google Scholar). Antisense and sense riboprobes were generated from the Adss1 cDNA and from the CAT cDNA. All of the probes were acid-hydrolyzed to an average size of 750 bp. Sections were viewed with an Olympus BX60 microscope, and photographs were captured using a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc.). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215560) Google Scholar). CAT assays were performed as described (22Winston J.H. Hanten G.R. Overbeek P.A. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13472-13479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CAT specific activity was determined under linear conditions. Total cellular RNA from tissues was isolated by the Trizol procedure as described (Life Technologies, Inc.). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (19Lewis A.L. Guicherit O.M. Datta S.K. Hanten G.R. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22647-22656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Neonatal rat cardiac nuclear extract was prepared from primary cardiomyocyte cultures as described (23Bohinski R.J. Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to various regions of theAdss1 5′-flanking region were synthesized as follows: Nkx 2.5 (nt −1523 to −1504), MEF2 (nt −1713 to −1694), E box A (nt −1914 to −1894), E box B (nt −1893 to −1874), E box C (nt −1863 to −1834), and E box D (nt −1773 to −1754), GATA site A (nt −1423 to −1402), GATA site B (nt −1407 to −1384), GATA site C (nt −1483 to −1354), GATA site D (nt −1353 to −1324), and GATA site E (nt −1063 to −1043). The Nkx 2.5 site was mutated to taaTAtg, the MEF2 site was mutated to cGaCCtCtCg, GATA sites A–C were mutated to CAGTGC, GATA sites D and E were mutated to GCGTTG, and E boxes A–D were mutated to GGTAAC (mutated sites are capitalized). These oligonucleotides were used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis (24Shi D. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27331-27338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The 1.9HSCAT construct was described previously (19Lewis A.L. Guicherit O.M. Datta S.K. Hanten G.R. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22647-22656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The 0.6XhSCAT construct was generated by digesting the HSCAT/pSG5 vector with XhoI andSalI, blunt-ending with T4 polymerase, and was cloned into the EcoRV site of the Bluescript KS+ vector. The 700-bp Adss1 HindIII-XbaI fragment was blunt-ended with Klenow and cloned in the SmaI site in front of the SPAC (short promoter Ada CAT) (22Winston J.H. Hanten G.R. Overbeek P.A. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13472-13479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) construct in both the forward and the reverse orientations. The SPAC construct is present in the Bluescript KS+ vector backbone and consists of an 800-bp minimalAda promoter, the CAT cDNA, and a SV40 intron and polyadenylation signal. The Nkx 2.5, MEF2, and GATA site-directed mutants were generated by a PCR megaprimer procedure. The primers that were used are as follows (mutated nucleotides are capitalized, and transcription factor sites are underlined): universal site sequencing primer, mutant MEF oligonucleotide reverse, 5′-tcaaagcctgagacGaGaGGtCgccaagggcccacataga-3′; mutant Nkx 2.5 forward, 5′-caagggcaagcattaaTAtgacctgaccaa-3′; mutant GATA A–D forward spanned nucleotides −1423 to −1324 in which sites A–C were changed to CAGTGC, and site D was changed toGCGTTG and primer B, 5′-tctctacctcactcagtgcca-3′. The first PCR reac- tion generated the fragment that contained the mutant site. The PCR fragment was gel-purified by the QiaexII kit (Qiagen, Inc.). That fragment was then used as the megaprimer for the second PCR reaction. PCR cycling conditions were as follows: hot start at 94 °C for 10 min, then 94 °C for 1 min; 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 30 cycles; a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min; and hold the reactions at 4 °C. The large fragment was gel-purified by the QiaexII kit (Qiagen, Inc.) and was then digested withXbaI and cloned into the XbaI-digested, calf intestinal phosphatase-treated HSCAT backbone. All constructs were isolated by cesium gradient purification (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.42-1.43Google Scholar). The orientation of the cloned fragment was determined by restriction enzyme digestion, and the presence of the mutant site was confirmed by sequencing (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The 5′ deletion HSCAT construct was generated by a partialApaI digestion of the 1.9HSCAT construct. The deletion fragment was gel-purified by the QiaexII kit (Qiagen, Inc.), blunt-ended with T4 polymerase, and religated. The expression constructs for CV1 cotransfection analysis; pCGN (26Chen C.Y.

Expression constructs CMV Hand1 and CMV Hand2 were generated by cloning the respective cDNAs into theEcoRV site of the pCDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). Transient transfection into neonatal rat primary cardiomyocytes were performed as described (29Xia Y. Buja L.M. McMillin J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12082-12087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). CAT assays and β-gal assays were performed as described (22Winston J.H. Hanten G.R. Overbeek P.A.

Experimental data are presented as the mean of three independent transfection assays done in duplicate and normalized to β-gal activity. Transgene constructs were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified by either a QiaexII kit or a Qiaquick kit (Qiagen, Inc.). Transgenic mice were prepared by injecting the constructs in fertilized FVB/N oocytes (31Taketo M. Schroeder A.C. Mobraaten L.E. Gunning K.B. Hanten G. Fox R.R. Roderick T.H. Stewart C.L. Lilly F.

Founder (F0) transgenic animals were identified as described previously (19Lewis A.L. Guicherit O.M. Datta S.K. Hanten G.R. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22647-22656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cotransfections into CV1 fibroblasts were performed as described previously (27Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with a total of 3 μg of plasmid DNA, which included 500 ng of 1.9HSCAT reporter plasmid, 1 μg of CMV β-gal, and various concentrations of expression vector plasmids (250 ng of CMV Nkx 2.5, 250 ng of CMV GATA 4, 150 ng of CMV MEF2C, 150 ng of CMV E12, 250 ng of Hand1, and 250 ng of CMV Hand2). All transfections were balanced with a CMV empty vector. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped from dishes in 400 μl of a CAT assay buffer. The cells were lysed by sonication and were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a clean tube, and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215560) Google Scholar). CAT assays and β-gal assays were performed (22Winston J.H. Hanten G.R. Overbeek P.A. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13472-13479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Xia Y. Buja L.M. Scarpulla R.C. McMillin J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11399-11404Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Values were the average of at least three experiments, each with duplicate plates and were normalized to β-gal activity. Previously, we reported that 1.9 kb of Adss1 5′-flanking DNA possessed the ability to direct high levels of reporter gene expression to the adult murine transgenic heart (19Lewis A.L. Guicherit O.M. Datta S.K. Hanten G.R. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22647-22656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To determine whether this 1.9-kbAdss1 fragment possesses the capability to control correct spatiotemporal expression of a reporter, 1.9HSCAT transgenic embryos were analyzed at different developmental times. Both the endogenousAdss1 gene and the 1.9HSCAT transgene were expressed in both the atrium and ventricle of the heart at 9.0 d.p.c. (Fig.1, A and B). At 11.5 d.p.c., expression of both the endogenous gene and the transgene were detected in both chambers of the heart and in the developing facial and jaw muscles (Fig. 1 C). Interestingly, the level of CAT mRNA was lower than the level of Adss1mRNA in the atrium (Fig. 1 D). Faint expression of both the Adss1 gene and the 1.9HSCAT transgene was also detected in the fetal liver (Fig. 1, C and D). No signal above background was detected with sense riboprobes (data not shown). To determine whether the 1.9-kb 5′-flanking region has the capability to maintain reporter gene expression during late embryogenesis, a founder 1.9HSCAT transgenic litter was dissected at 15 d.p.c., and cardiac and liver tissues were analyzed for CAT enzyme activity. In two transgenic embryos (11 and 12), CAT enzyme was strongly expressed in the heart, but negligible levels were detected in the liver (Fig.1 E). This experiment shows that transgene expression in the liver ceased, while transgene expression in the heart remained high. No CAT activity was detected in these tissues in nontransgenic embryos (9 and 10). Thus, the 1.9-kb Adss1 5′ fragment possesses the capabilities to activate gene expression in cardiac progenitors and to sustain expression throughout embryonic cardiac development. Several cardiac and muscle energy metabolic genes experience a transcriptional up-regulation during perinatal development to support the increased energy demands of the growing, mobile organism (41Braun T. Tannich E. Buschhausen-Denker G. Arnold H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2513-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 42Grepin C. Dagnino L. Robitaille L. Haberstroh L. Antakly T. Nemes M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3115-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To determine whether Adss1 cardiac expression also increases during neonatal development, total RNA was isolated from 1.9HSCAT transgenic hearts at different developmental timepoints (Fig.2 A), and Northern analysis was performed using both Adss1 and CAT probes. Adss1transcripts were expressed at low levels on embryonic day 17, and expression continued to steadily increase through day 21 of postnatal development. Expression of the 1.9HSCAT construct was not detected at embryonic day 17 by Northern analysis, but transcripts were visualized by day 1, and 1.9HSCAT expression continued to be up-regulated through day 21. However, the expression of the 1.9HSCAT construct appeared to be up-regulated more slowly than the expression of the endogenousAdss1 gene. The expression of both genes is depicted graphically in Fig. 2 B. In conclusion, both the endogenousAdss1 gene and the 1.9HSCAT construct undergo a phase of transcriptional enhancement during perinatal cardiac development that is similar to several other muscle metabolic genes. Important characteristics that define an enhancer element are the ability to confer integration site independence and copy number dependence (32Engel J.D. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 304-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To determine whether the 1.9-kb Adss1 5′ flank can confer dominant expression capability, the total CAT activity of the 1.9HSCAT construct was compared with the copy number (Fig.2 C). Copy numbers ranged from 1 to 16. The graph resulted in a linear relationship with 9/9 transgenic mouse hearts. Therefore, the 1.9 kb of Adss1 5′ flank appears to confer both integration site independence and copy number dependence on the CAT reporter gene. Since expression of the 1.9HSCAT construct can be reasonably predicted based on copy number, we determined whether this 1.9-kb flanking region contains all the information necessary to direct the proper levels of reporter expression to the adult transgenic heart. Total RNA was isolated from various tissues of an adult 1.9HSCAT mouse containing 16 copies of the transgene (Fig. 2 D). Northern analysis showed the expected pattern of Adss1 mRNA expression in skeletal muscle and heart, with the highest levels being expressed in skeletal muscle tissue (4Guicherit O.M. Rudolph F.B. Kellems R.E. Cooper B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22582-22587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No expression was detected in nonmuscle tissues. A CAT probe revealed 1.9HSCAT expression specifically in adult transgenic heart tissue, but not in skeletal muscle. Therefore, the 1.9HSCAT construct directs expression specifically to the adult transgenic heart, and the levels of CAT mRNA appear to be comparable with the endogenous levels of Adss1 mRNA in cardiac tissue (see “Discussion”). In conclusion, the 1.9-kbAdss1 5′ flank properly activates cardiac reporter expression, controls correct developmental cardiac up-regulation, and directs levels of reporter expression to the adult heart that are similar to endogenous Adss1 levels. We demonstrated that the 700 base pairs of Adss1 5′ flank between 1.9 and 1.2 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site are essential for expression of the reporter construct in cardiac tissue (19Lewis A.L.

To determine whether this 700-bpHindIII-XbaI region can act as a cardiac enhancer, this fragment was cloned in front of the SPAC construct (see “Materials and Methods”) in both the forward and reverse orientations (Fig. 3,A and B). This construct contained an 800-bp adenosine deaminase promoter (Ada), which is expressed at negligible levels in murine cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues (22Winston J.H. Hanten G.R. Overbeek P.A. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13472-13479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This minimal Ada promoter alone is not activated in tissues of transgenic mice, but when controlled by a placental, thymic, or forestomach enhancer, the promoter is activated specifically in those respective tissues (22Winston J.H.

Both HX.SPAC + and − constructs directed highest levels of expression of the reporter construct to cardiac tissue (Fig. 3, A andB). However, the levels of CAT enzyme activity were 500–1000-fold lower than the 1.9HSCAT levels in the transgenic heart (data not shown). Therefore, the 700-bp Adss1 fragment possesses the ability to activate a heterologous Adapromoter in both the forward and reverse orientations in the transgenic murine heart. To begin to determine whether cardiac proteins interact with potential cardiac binding sites present in the 700-bp HindIII-XbaI fragment from theAdss1 5′-flanking region, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed (Fig. 4). Each of the possible transcription factor binding sites was end-labeled and used as a probe to determine whether proteins present in a neonatal rat primary cardiac nuclear extract bind to the sites. First, a shifted complex was evident with an Adss1 Nkx 2.5 probe (Fig.4 A, lane 1). This complex was competed away by 25 × and 50 × (lanes 2 and 3) of cold wild type Nkx oligonucleotide, but only partially by 100 × of mutant Nkx oligonucleotide (lane 4). Next, theAdss1 MEF2 probe bound proteins from the rat cardiac nuclear extract (Fig. 4 B, lane 5). 50 and 100 × cold wild type MEF2 oligonucleotides competed away binding (lanes 6 and 7), but 100 × cold mutant MEF2 oligonucleotides did not compete (lane 8). Third, each of the four E boxes from the Adss1 5′ flank bound proteins present in the rat cardiac nuclear extract (Fig. 4 C,lanes 9, 12, 15, and 18). Binding was competed away by 100 × each of the cold wild type E box oligonucleotides (lanes 10, 13,16, and 19), but not by 100 × cold mutant E box oligonucleotides (lanes 11, 14,17, and 20). Multiple protein complexes formed on the E box C binding site (lanes 15–17). Finally, proteins present in the cardiac nuclear extract interacted with each of theAdss1 GATA transcription factor binding sites (Fig.4 D, lanes 21, 24, 27,30, and 33). Binding was competed away by 100 × cold wild type GATA oligonucleotides (lanes 22,25, 28, 31, and 34), but not by 100 × cold mutant GATA oligonucleotides (lanes 23, 26, 29, 32, and35). Again, several different protein complexes were apparent on GATA sites B (lanes 24–26) and E (lanes 33–35). In summary, proteins present in a neonatal rat cardiac nuclear extract can specifically bind to each of the potentialAdss1 transcription factor binding sites, but do not bind to the mutant transcription factor sites. Mutations were generated in the 1.9HSCAT construct to identify binding sites that regulate Adss1expression in cardiac muscle (Fig.5 A). The Nkx, MEF2, and GATA site mutations used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis were introduced into the 1.9HSCAT constru"
