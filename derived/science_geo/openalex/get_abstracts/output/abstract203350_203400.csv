https://openalex.org/W2071027974,"Through the intravenous inoculation of soil suspensions in the tail vein of mice, Blastomyces dermatitidis was recovered from a Lexington, Kentucky, soil sample. The positive specimen was collected in a tobacco-stripping barn. The shed had sheltered a dog that died of blastomycosis 2 years before the sample was collected."

The medium used is diphasic and contains a cell-free extract of chick embryo which is essential for growth. Inocula of 50,000 amoebas yield 150,000 to 200,000 organisms in 72 hours of incubation at 35°C. An extract prepared from boiled embryos supports growth equally well."

The effects of norepinephrine concentration, reserpine, and ouabain on the uptake suggest that the amine enters cells both by diffusion and by a concentrating miechanism that is saturated at low levels of norepinephrine. The drugs inhibit the latter."

Isolation was made in a serially transplantable cell line originating from human embryonic lung. Efforts to identify these agents as known viruses, by utilizing standard techniques, have been unsuccessful"

https://openalex.org/W1997036265,Observation of the action potential and contraction of the leaf of Dionaea muscipula Ellis revealed several interesting phenomena. Two successive stimuli are generally necessary to cause contraction. The first and ineffective stimulus is associated with slow depolarization. The second stimulus has much more rapid depolarization and initiates contraction.

https://openalex.org/W2154910194,The basis of the mutant phenotype of the pyr 3a strain of Neurospora appears to be the arginine sensitivity of an early step in pyrimidine synthesis. The effect of a suppressor mutation which renders pyr 3a pyrimidine-independent is to reduce arginine levels in the mycelium by its effect on ornithine transcarbamylase.

https://openalex.org/W2022077858,"A survey of the structure of the cell walls of green, brown, and red algae, as seen under light and electron microscopes is in progress. In this report a comparison of the cell wall structure of a brown alga, Dictyota flabellata, and a red alga, Helminthocladia californica, is presented. In Dictyota, typicalofthe brown algae, the microfibrillar pattern in the apical cells and in the adjacent cells of the thallus tip is reticulate. In mature cells the microfibrils are dominantly parallel in orientation. Pits, fields ofclosely set pores, are distinctive. The microfibrils in the pit areas are masked by nonfibrillar material. Helminthocladia, with a cell wall characteristic of the red algae, differs from Dictyota in that the microfibrillar pattern is reticulate throughout the thallus. In the pit areas the microfibrils are not masked by amorphous material."

https://openalex.org/W1992709274,"IN previous communications from this laboratory, the synthesis of urea-14C from arginine-14C was reported to occur in the living rat brain1,2. In these experiments only the rat brains were analysed for their radioactive urea content, and the objection was raised that perhaps these levels did not indicate endogenous brain urea synthesis, but were merely a reflexion of blood 14C-urea levels, especially since it is known that urea readily diffuses across the blood brain barrier. Experiments were therefore designed to show that the brain 14C-urea levels were independent of blood 14C-urea levels and that the brain had the capacity to synthesize urea from arginine. This communication describes such experiments."

https://openalex.org/W2151010792,"WHEN bacterial cells are disrupted by any of the methods now in use, a considerable amount of ultra-microscopic particles is released from them, and these can be isolated by ultracentrifugation, usually for 1–2 hr. at 100,000g. This fraction is quite heterogeneous. The function and localization in the cell of its different components are not yet clearly known. This is probably the reason why the nomenclature of these particles is still in a rather confused state. According to different authors they have been called ‘mitochondria’, ‘microsomes’, ‘particles’, ‘small particles’, ‘particulate fraction’, ‘ETP’ etc."

During purification and assay of the enzyme, it was found that the enzymatic activity of hurain is greatly affected by metal ions."
