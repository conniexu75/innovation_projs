https://openalex.org/W1973303770,"To analyze cell lineage in the murine cerebral cortex, we infected progenitor cells with a recombinant retrovirus, then used the retroviral gene product to identify the descendants of infected cells. Cortices were infected on E12-E14 either in vivo or following dissociation and culture. In both cases, nearly all clones contained either neurons or glia, but not both. Thus, neuronal and glial lineages appear to diverge early in cortical development. To analyze the distribution of clonally related cells in vivo, clonal boundaries were reconstructed from serial sections. Perinatally (E18-PN0), clonally related cells were radially arrayed as they migrated to the cortical plate. Thus, clonal cohorts traverse a similar radial path. Following migration (PN7-PN23), neuronal clones generally remained radially arrayed, while glial clones were variable in orientation, suggesting that these two cell types accumulate in different ways. Neuronal clones sometimes spanned the full thickness of the cortex. Thus, a single progenitor can contribute neurons to several laminae."
https://openalex.org/W1987906661,"Levels of the inhibitory transmitter, GABA, and its synthesizing enzyme, GAD, appear to be regulated in the visual cortex of young adult monkeys in an activity-dependent manner. In monkeys subjected to monocular deprivation by eye removal, tetrodotoxin injection, or eyelid suture, the number of GABA and GAD immunoreactive neurons in deprived-eye columns of the cortex is reduced by up to 50%. This effect is unaccompanied by cell death and is reversible. After cessation of TTX injection or reopening of the eyes, the number of immunostained cells returns to normal. The effect appears after 4–5 days of eye removal or tetrodotoxin injection, but only after 7–16 weeks of eyelid suture. In the latter case, it is more severe in the younger monkeys. The reversible reduction in GABA and GAD immunostaining extends out of layer IVC into layer IVA and to neurons around but not in cytochrome oxidase periodicities of layer III. This may indicate selective vulnerability of GABA cells sensitive to high spatial frequency."
https://openalex.org/W1993635776,"Serotonin (5-HT) induces a large inward current accompanied by a conductance increase when applied focally to either neurons of mouse hippocampal cultures or cells of the NG108-15 clonal cell line. In both systems, the response is blocked by ICS 205-930, curare, and metoclopramide, while 2-methyl-5-HT is an agonist. The actions of ICS 205-930 and 2-methyl-5-HT indicate that the response is mediated by the 5-HT3 receptor. In NG108-15 cells the response activated in as little as 35 ms. The rapidity of the response suggests a direct coupling between the 5-HT3 receptor and a channel, which are probably both part of a single membrane protein. In both cell types, prolonged application of 5-HT resulted in desensitization; the rates of desensitization were accelerated by the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin. The 5-HT3 receptor has much in common with the nicotinic receptor and is probably involved in rapid synaptic transmission in the mammalian brain. Since this response is modulated by manipulations that elevate intracellular cAMP levels, the central synapses in which this receptor operates may exhibit plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2017619951,"To define further the molecules that control sympathoadrenal differentiation, we have investigated the effects of FGF, NGF, and glucocorticoid on cultured neonatal rat adrenal chromaffin cells. Basic FGF (bFGF), like NGF, induces cell division and neurite outgrowth from these cells. Dexamethasone inhibits neuronal differentiation but not proliferation induced by bFGF Unlike NGF, bFGF will not support the survival of chromaffin cell-derived sympathetic neurons. However, bFGF induces a dependence on NGF The overlapping but distinct responses to NGF and bFGF may underlie a sequence of events in sympathetic differentiation. bFGF (or another factor) may act locally in developing ganglia to stimulate mitotic expansion and initial axon outgrowth. Subsequent survival and maturation are then controlled by NGF, which is provided by peripheral targets of innervation. In the adrenal gland, glucocorticoids may permit bFGF to amplify the chromaffin population, while preventing neuronal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2008411984,"Denervation of adult skeletal muscle results in increased sensitivity to acetylcholine in extrajunctional regions of the muscle fiber. This increase in acetylcholine sensitivity is accompanied by a large increase in the level of mRNAs coding for the alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-subunits of the acetylcholine receptor. To determine whether muscle activity is sufficient to regulate expression of extrajunctional acetylcholine receptor mRNA levels, denervated muscles were stimulated with extracellular electrodes. Direct stimulation of denervated muscle suppresses both the increase in extrajunctional acetylcholine sensitivity and the expression of mRNA encoding the alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-subunits of the acetylcholine receptor. These results show that muscle activity regulates the level of extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors by regulating the expression of their mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1516306518,"The purpose of this work was to investigate the molecular mechanism responsible for the induction of hepatic glucokinase in diabetic rats acutely treated with insulin. Experimental diabetes was provoked by injection of streptozotocin 8-10 days before the experiments. Regular insulin was given by three intraperitoneal injections at 8-h intervals, and the time course of glucokinase induction was followed over a time period of 24 h. The amount of glucokinase in liver was estimated by Western blotting of total cytosol protein with affinity-purified antibodies, as well as by conventional enzyme activity assay. Both measurements showed that glucokinase was reduced by more than 90% in the livers of diabetic rats as compared to normal controls. Following insulin administration, the amount (and activity) of glucokinase increased in a time-dependent fashion, after an initial lag of 4 h, to reach 65% of the nondiabetic control level 24 h after the initial dose of insulin. Northern blot analysis with a cloned cDNA probe was used to quantitate glucokinase mRNA. In contrast with the slow onset of enzyme accumulation, the amount of glucokinase mRNA was shown to be increased dramatically as early as 1 h after insulin administration. The abundance of specific mRNA increased until 8 h after the initial dose of insulin. Subsequently, the level of the mRNA decayed rapidly so that little message was left after 16 h and virtually none after 24 h. Run-on transcription experiments with isolated nuclei showed that the rate of transcription of the glucokinase gene was increased about 20-fold within 45 min of insulin administration and returned to the prestimulation level after 8 h. From these data, it was concluded that the induction of glucokinase resulted primarily from a burst in the transcriptional activity of the gene, leading to a short-term accumulation of glucokinase mRNA. The more sustained elevation of the enzyme level can be accounted for by the long half-life of the enzyme (greater than 30 h). The virtually immediate activation of glucokinase gene transcription suggests a direct effect of insulin on the liver cell."
https://openalex.org/W1549934991,"4-Methylumbelliferyl (4-MU) glycosides of N-acetylglucosamine oligosaccharides were used as substrates to detect expression of a Streptomyces chitinase in Escherichia coli. Low levels of enzyme were detected when S. plicatus DNA was cloned into a bacteriophage lambda vector (EMBL-4). Subcloning into E. coli plasmids also gave low but detectable levels of enzyme expression. High level expression was achieved by resection of the cloned S. plicatus DNA with Bal31 followed by in-frame fusion to the amino-terminal peptide sequence of beta-galactosidase found in the pUC vectors. The Streptomyces chitinase was secreted into the periplasmic space of E. coli, and its signal sequence was removed. We characterized the activity of the cloned enzyme and compared it to three other purified Streptomyces plicatus chitinases with respect to hydrolysis of the 4-MU oligosaccharides. We found that two of the enzymes form 4-methylumbelliferone much more rapidly from the 4-MU disaccharide than from the trisaccharide. These same enzymes convert the 4-MU trisaccharide primarily to diacetylchitobiose and the 4-MU monosaccharide, a nonfluorescent product. The latter compound is not hydrolyzed appreciably by any of the enzymes. On the basis of these results, we suggest a new definition of exo and endo chitinase that differs from that found in the literature. We propose that exochitinase activity be defined as processive action starting at the nonreducing ends of chitin chains with release of successive diacetylchitobiose units, and that endochitinase activity be defined as random cleavage at internal points in chitin chains."
https://openalex.org/W1526504444,"S1 mapping on the VAS1 structural gene indicates the existence of two classes of transcripts initiating at distinct in-frame translation start codons. The longer class of VAS1 transcripts initiates upstream of both ATG codons located 138 base pairs away and the shorter class downstream of the first ATG. A mutation that destroys the first AUG on the long message results in respiratory deficiency but does not affect viability. Mutation of the ATG at position 139 leads to lethality because the initiating methionine codon of the essential cytoplasmic valyl-tRNA synthetase has been destroyed. N-terminal protein sequence data further confirm translation initiation at ATG-139 for the cytoplasmic valyl-tRNA synthetase. From these results, we conclude that the VAS1 single gene encodes both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic valyl-tRNA synthetases. The presequence of the mitochondrial valyl-tRNA synthetase shows amino acid composition but not the amphiphilic character of imported mitochondrial proteins. From mutagenesis of the ATG-139 we conclude that the presequence specifically targets the cytoplasmically synthesized mitochondrial valyl-tRNA synthetase to the mitochondrial outer membrane and prevents binding of the enzyme core to cytoplasmic tRNAVal."
https://openalex.org/W2019562175,"The Shaker gene encodes the A-channel of larval and pupal muscle, or one or more of its subunits. Alternative splicing produces messages for several different proteins; two mRNA species have previously been shown to induce the expression of A-currents in Xenopus oocytes. Two additional mRNAs have now been tested and found to produce A-currents in oocytes. The four currents differ in kinetics of inactivation, indicating that the Shaker products may contribute to kinetic diversity in A-channels of the fly and that sequences in both the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions are important for inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2103015548,"Serotonin (5-HT) inhibits elongation of neurites of specific identified neurons. Here we report a novel, growth-enabling action of another neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (ACh). When applied simultaneously with serotonin, ACh prevents the inhibition of Helisoma neuron B19 neurite elongation that would occur in response to application of 5-HT alone. We also report that ACh prevents the rise in growth cone Ca2+ that would occur in response to application of 5-HT alone and that ACh blocks the electrical excitatory effect of 5-HT on neuron B19. These results support the hypothesis that growth cone motility and neurite elongation can be regulated by voltage-gated Ca2+ fluxes and suggest that the dynamics of neurite morphology may be complexly regulated by an array of neurotransmitters, as is functional electrical activity."
https://openalex.org/W1532404678,"Tyr(P)-containing proteins were purified from extracts of insulin-treated rat hepatoma cells (H4-II-E-C3) by antiphosphotyrosine immunoaffinity chromatography. Two major insulin-stimulated, Tyr(P) proteins were recovered: an Mr 95,000 protein (identified as the insulin receptor beta subunit by its immunoprecipitation by a patient-derived anti-insulin receptor serum and several anti-insulin receptor (peptide) antisera) and an Mr 180,000 protein (which was unreactive with all anti-insulin receptor antibodies). After purification and tryptic digestion of the Mr 95,000 protein, tryptic peptides containing Tyr(P) were purified by sequential antiphosphotyrosine immunoaffinity, reversed-phase, anion-exchange chromatography. The partial amino acid sequence obtained by gas- and solid-phase Edman degradation was compared to the amino acid sequence of the intracellular extension of the rat insulin receptor deduced from the genomic sequence. Approximately 80% of all beta subunit [32P]Tyr(P) resides on two tryptic peptides: 50-60% of [32P]Tyr(P) is found on the tryptic peptide Asp-Ile-Tyr-Glu-Thr-Asp-Tyr-Tyr-Arg from the tyrosine kinase domain, which is recovered mainly as the double phosphorylated species (predominantly in the form with Tyr(P) at residues 3 and 7 from the amino terminus; the remainder with Tyr(P) at residues 3 and 8), with 10-15% as the triple phosphorylated species. A second tryptic peptide is located near the carboxyl terminus, contains 2 tyrosines, and has the sequence, Thr-Tyr-Asp-Glu-His-Ile-Pro-Tyr-Thr-; this contains 20-30% of beta subunit [32P]Tyr(P) and is identified primarily in a double phosphorylated form. Approximately 10% of beta subunit [32P]Tyr(P) resides on an unidentified tryptic peptide of Mr 4,000-5,000. The insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in intact rat hepatoma cells thus involves at least 6 of the 13 tyrosine residues located on the beta subunit intracellular extension. These tyrosines are clustered in several domains in a distribution virtually identical to that previously found for partially purified human insulin receptor autophosphorylated in vitro in the presence of insulin. This multisite regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation is the initial intracellular event in insulin action."
https://openalex.org/W2022053073,"Brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are made up of protein subunits that differ from those constituting muscle nAChRs. To characterize the physiological properties of one class of avian brain nicotinic receptor, we injected the nuclei of Xenopus oocytes with full-length cDNAs for the ligand binding (alpha 4) and structural (n alpha) subunits. Injected oocytes had large ACh-induced currents in the microampere range that were insensitive to alpha-bungarotoxin, as expected for neuronal nAChRs. We found that these brain nAChRs incorporate at least two alpha 4 subunits and that their functional properties differ from muscle nAChRs in at least two respects: the elementary conductance is considerably smaller (20 pS), and channels in outside out patches stop functioning within a few minutes."
https://openalex.org/W2093048632,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) immunoaffinity-purified from brains are composed of only two kinds of subunits rather than the four kinds present in muscle-type AChRs. Here we report the N-terminal protein sequences of the structural subunits of AChRs from rat and chicken brains and the cloning of full-length cDNAs for the chicken brain AChR structural subunit. Previously, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the ACh-binding subunit of AChR immunoaffinity-purified from rat brain was shown to correspond to the cDNA alpha 4. Thus, cDNA sequences are now known for both of the subunits that form one AChR subtype in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1535445115,"Abstract Yeast cells from a wild type or protease-deficient strain were lysed in the absence or presence of protease inhibitors and the extracts analyzed by analytical high pressure liquid chromatography on diethylaminoethyl silica gel. Conditions that inhibited protease action caused elution of a novel DNA polymerase activity at a position in the gradient distinct from the elution positions of both DNA polymerase I and II. In large scale purifications, this DNA polymerase, called DNA polymerase III, copurified with a single-stranded DNA dependent 3'-5' exonuclease activity, exonuclease III, to near homogeneity. Glycerol gradient centrifugation partially dissociated the complex to yield two peaks of exonuclease III activity, one at 7.7 S together with the DNA polymerase, and one at 4.0 S without polymerase activity. Gel filtration indicated that the complex has a molecular mass greater than 400 kDa. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate indicated that the complex consists of several subunits: 140, 62, 55, and 53 kilodaltons, some of which may be proteolysis products. The exonuclease component of the complex can excise single nucleotide mismatches providing a base-paired primer-template which can be elongated by the DNA polymerase. Under replication conditions, the complex exhibits a measurable turnover rate of dTTP to dTMP and it contains no primase activity. The enzymatic activities of the 3'-5' exonuclease are consistent with a proofreading function during in vivo DNA replication. A second exonuclease activity, exonuclease IV, separated from the complex late in the purification scheme. It degrades both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA in the 5'----3' direction."
https://openalex.org/W2088328271,"Acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) is a heparin-binding polypeptide that is a mitogen for endothelial cells and glial cells, as well as a differentiation factor for PC12 cells and certain neurons. We show here that aFGF is as potent as nerve growth factor (NGF) in stimulating both neuritic outgrowth and proliferation in adrenal chromaffin cells from young rats, but it fails to support long-term survival. Heparin strongly potentiates aFGF-dependent neuritic outgrowth but not aFGF-dependent proliferation. As is the case with NGF, phorbol myristate acetate depresses aFGF-induced cell division and increases the outgrowth of neurites. On the other hand, dexamethasone antagonizes neuritic outgrowth elicited by both NGF and aFGF but inhibits only proliferation induced by NGF. The effects of basic FGF (bFGF) are similar but not identical to those of aFGF. Thus the regulatory pathways controlled by aFGF, bFGF, and NGF are partially distinct."
https://openalex.org/W2016844708,"Fast transient K+ channels (A channels) of the type operating in the subthreshold region for Na+ action potential generation were expressed in Xenopus oocytes injected with rat brain poly(A) RNA. Sucrose gradient fractionation of the RNA separates mRNAs encoding A-currents (6-7 kb) from mRNAs encoding other voltage-dependent K+ channels. A-currents expressed with fractionated mRNA differ in kinetics and pharmacology from A-currents expressed with total mRNA. The original properties of the A-currents can be reconstituted when small mRNAs (2-4 kb) are added to the large mRNA fraction. Thus the properties of the A-currents expressed with total poly(A) RNA depend on the presence of more than one mRNA species. mRNA(s) present in the large RNA fraction must encode channel subunits since they express an A-current by themselves. The small mRNA(s) may encode a second subunit(s) or a factor, such as an enzymatic activity that modulates the properties of the channels, which could play a role in generating A-channel functional diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2059035007,"A cDNA (199E) specific for the 57 kd neural IF protein has been isolated from a PC12 cell lambda gt11 library. Antibody eluted from the fusion protein produced by 199E recognizes the 57 kd protein on immunoblots and, in PC12 cells, labels a pattern of fibrillar structures identical to that seen with 57 kd antiserum. In situ hybridization using antisense RNA transcripts labels areas of the nervous system known to contain the 57 kd protein. 199E hybridizes with a single mRNA species of approximately 2.0 kb from PC12 cells. A 199E-reactive message can be detected as early as E10 in rat embryos. Southern analyses suggest that there is only one gene for this protein. Amino acid sequence predicted from 199E indicates that the 57 kd protein is a type III IF protein like vimentin and desmin. Thus, expression of IF structural genes in neurons is not limited to the type IV neuronal IF triplet proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2147287875,"A chicken genomic clone encoding a portion of the neuronal acetylcholine receptor (AChR) alpha 3 subunit was used to identify homologous mRNA in embryonic chick ciliary ganglia. In situ hybridization indicated that the mRNA was neuronal. Northern blot analysis revealed a major hybridizing species of 3.5 kb. Protection experiments confirmed that ganglionic RNA contained material indistinguishable by RNAase digestion from the 300 nucleotide probe used. No transcripts were detected by in situ hybridization or Northern blot analysis for chick neuronal AChR alpha 2 or alpha 4 genes. alpha 3 transcripts were present at all times examined (E6 to 1 year posthatch). Both postganglionic axotomy and preganglionic denervation of ciliary ganglia in newly hatched chicks produced declines in alpha 3 mRNA levels, implying regulation of neuronal AChR mRNA by cell-cell interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1568295454,"Abstract We have probed the interaction of T7 RNA polymerase with DNA in an elongation complex arrested by a site specifically placed psoralen diadduct or furanside monoadduct using DNase I footprinting techniques. The psoralen derivative, HMT (4'-hydroxy-methyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen), was first placed at a specific site in the middle of a chemically synthesized double-stranded DNA fragment containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter at one end. The psoralen molecule was photochemically attached either to 2 adjacent thymidine residues on opposite strands as a diadduct or to only 1 thymidine residue on the coding strand as a furan-side monoadduct. Using these psoralen-modified DNAs as templates for transcription, we found that T7 RNA polymerase was blocked at the psoralen adduct site and that the arrested elongation complex protected about 15 nucleotides upstream from the adduct on the coding strand and 20 nucleotides around the adduct on the noncoding strand from DNase I digestion. The two psoralen-modified DNA templates yielded identical RNA transcripts and DNase I footprints. In contrast, T7 polymerase protected only the coding strand from -20 to +8 in the initiation complex. These results suggest that the RNA polymerase undergoes a marked conformational change upon converting from an initiation complex to an elongation complex."
https://openalex.org/W1490078221,"The OmpR protein is a positive regulator involved in osmoregulatory expression of the ompC and ompF genes that specify the major outer membrane proteins OmpC and OmpF, respectively. We purified the OmpR protein not only from wild-type cells but also from two ompR mutants (ompR2 and ompR3) exhibiting quite different phenotypes as to osmoregulation of the ompC and ompF genes. The OmpR2 protein has an amino acid conversion in the C-terminal portion of the OmpR polypeptide, whereas the OmpR3 protein has one in the N-terminal portion. Comparative studies on these purified OmpR proteins were carried out in terms of their interaction with the ompC and ompF promoters. The nucleotide sequences involved in OmpR-binding were determined in individual promoter regions by deoxyribonuclease I footprinting. The OmpR3 protein as well as the wild-type OmpR protein appeared to bind, to similar extents, to both the ompC and ompF promoters. In contrast, the OmpR2 protein bound preferentially to the ompF promoter and failed to protect the ompC promoter against DNAse I digestion. These results support the view that the C-terminal portion of the OmpR protein is responsible for the binding of the OmpR protein to the ompC and ompF promoter DNAs. Based on these results, the structure and function of the OmpR protein are discussed in relation to the mechanism of osmoregulation."
https://openalex.org/W1553490318,"The LEU4 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the major structural gene involved in the production of alpha-isopropylmalate synthase. It was recently proposed that LEU4 should be capable of encoding two forms of alpha-isopropylmalate synthase, based mainly on the observation that two of four major transcription start sites are located downstream from the ATG at the beginning of the LEU4 open reading frame (Beltzer, J. P., Chang, L. L., Hinkkanen, A. E., and Kohlhaw, G. B. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5160-5167). The two forms with molecular weights of 68,000 and 65,000, respectively, would differ only in the N-terminal region, and only the larger of the two forms would be imported into the mitochondria. We have now constructed LEU4'-'lacZ translational fusion plasmids that contain either a normal LEU4' portion (expected to express both the long and the short forms of the fusion protein) or a modified LEU4' portion in which productive translation is possible only from the second in-frame AUG (expected to express only the short form of the fusion protein). beta-Galactosidase measurements and immunoblotting of crude mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions of yeast cells transformed with the fusion plasmids indicate that two forms of hybrid protein are produced and that only the larger form is targeted to the mitochondria. The distinguishing feature of the targeting sequence appears to be its ability to form an 18-residue long amphiphilic helix. Expression of the native short form of LEU4-encoded alpha-isopropylmalate synthase behind a strong yeast promoter has enabled us to show that the short form is functional in leucine biosynthesis, is inhibited by leucine with an apparent inhibitor constant of approximately 0.4 mM, and exists as a cytoplasmic dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1586892062,"A yolk protein, egg-specific protein, synthesized and accumulated in the developing ovaries of Bombyx mori serves not only as the nutritive source for embryogenesis but also for the reorganization of the yolk system through limited degradation. Using the purified egg-specific protein as a substrate, a protease responsible for its limited hydrolysis was identified in embryonating eggs and purified to homogeneity. The protease had an apparent molecular mass of 30,500 with one subunit of 29,000 daltons. It hydrolyzes synthetic substrates at carbonyl bonds of Arg or Lys residues, and the hydrolysis is strongly inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and leupeptin, suggesting that it is a trypsin-like protease. The protease shows an extremely high degree (over 2,000-fold) of specificity for egg-specific protein compared to other yolk proteins. Intact egg-specific protein is cleaved into three fragments in two steps; the first releases a 8.7-kDa peptide as an end product and a 55-kDa peptide intermediate, and in the second the intermediate is cleaved into 36- and 17.2-kDa peptides. By relating the NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of these peptides to the sequence of the intact egg-specific protein, the protease was shown to cleave first at a Lys-Asn site and secondly at Arg-Asp. Proteolytic activity abruptly appears mid-way in embryogenesis and increases steeply during completion of larval differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2065387581,"Searching for specific markers of neural crest-derived cell lineages, we immunized mice with glycoproteins purified from adult quail peripheral myelin. We obtained a monoclonal antibody that reacts with myelin and peripheral glial cells. This antibody, to Schwann cell myelin protein (SMP), is specific for the membranes of all Schwann cells, irrespective of whether they are associated with myelinated nerves. SMP persists on Schwann cells in long-term cultures in vitro, but is absent from satellite cells of peripheral ganglia, both in vivo and in vitro. The antigen (a protein doublet of Mr 75,000–80,000) is present in, but not restricted to, the myelin lamellae, since it is distributed along the whole myelinating Schwann cell membrane. In the CNS, SMP appears as a single band of Mr 80,000. SMP is first detectable by immunofluorescence at E6 in the quail, which is at least 6 days earlier than the first appearance of already described markers related to myelination."
https://openalex.org/W1658793131,"LamB, an outer membrane protein of Escherichia coli, is a component of the maltose-maltooligosaccharide transport system. We used p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-maltohexaoside, a chromogenic analog of maltohexaose, and a periplasmic amylase that hydrolyzes this compound to study the LamB-mediated diffusion of p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-maltohexaoside into the periplasm. Using this approach, we were able to characterize LamB in vivo as a saturable channel for maltooligosaccharides. Permeation through LamB follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a Km of 0.13 mM and a Vmax of 3.3 nmol/min/10(9) cells. Previous studies suggested that maltose-binding protein increases the rate of maltooligosaccharide diffusion through LamB. We show here that, at least in strains that are unable to transport maltooligosaccharides into the cytoplasm, maltose-binding protein does not influence the rate of substrate diffusion. The periplasmic amylase had been previously described as being of the alpha-type. We have now purified this protein and analyzed its mode of action using chromogenic maltooligosaccharides of varying length. Analysis of the hydrolytic products revealed that the enzyme recognizes its substrate from the nonreducing that the enzyme recognizes its substrate from the nonreducing end and preferentially liberates maltohexaose, in contrast to the behavior of classical alpha-amylases that are endohydrolases. Using p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-maltohexaoside as a substrate, we determined a Km of 3 microM and a Vmax of 0.14 mumol/min/mg of protein."
https://openalex.org/W2093017309,"Long-term memory for sensitization of the gill- and siphon-withdrawal reflex in Aplysia, produced by 4 days of training, is associated with increased synaptic efficacy of the connection between the sensory and motor neurons. This training is also accompanied by neuronal growth; there is an increase in the number of synaptic varicosities per sensory neuron and in the number of active zones. Such structural changes may be due to changes in the rates of synthesis of certain proteins. We have searched for proteins in which the rates of [35S]methionine labeling are altered during the maintenance phase of long-term memory for sensitization by using computer-assisted quantitative 2-D gel analysis. This method has allowed us to detect 4 proteins in which labeling is altered after 4 days of sensitization training."
https://openalex.org/W2023587870,"The regulation of acetylcholine receptor α-subunit gene expression was analyzed by transient expression assays. Using rabbit β-globin cDNA as a reporter gene, we have confirmed that the 5′-flanking sequence of the chicken acetylcholine receptor a-subunit gene directs specific expression in differentiated C2C12 cells, a mouse muscle cell line, but not in undifferentiated C2C12 cells and mouse 3T3 fibroblasts. Testing chimeric plasmids containing Bal31 deletion mutants of the a-subunit gene upstream sequence, we found the - 116 to -81 region of the α-subunit to be responsible for tissue- and stage-specific expression. This 36 by fragment stimulates the activity of both α-subunit and SV40 promoters in a distance- and orientation-independent manner, thus fulfilling the criteria of an enhancer."
https://openalex.org/W1974113993,"Neural crest cells of vertebrate embryos produce neurons, glia, pigment cells, and connective tissue in vivo and in vitro. To test the developmental potential of apparently undifferentiated crest cells, we have used the monoclonal antibody A2B5, which recognizes a cell surface glycolipid characteristic of neurons, to identify and immunoablate a subpopulation of cultured avian neural crest cells with a neuronal phenotype. Our results indicate that a limited neurogenic precursor subpopulation is present in cultures of avian neural crest cells and that the fate of this subpopulation can be influenced by environmental conditions arising when dispersal of neural crest cells is delayed."
https://openalex.org/W1987836596,"Adult neurons, isolated from the salamander retina, were maintained in low-density cell culture and examined for synapse formation by electrophysiological and electron microscopic techniques. Morphologically identifiable rod, cone, horizontal, bipolar, and amacrine/ganglion cells survived for many months, grew processes, and formed numerous cell contacts. Intracellular recordings showed the presence of a variety of voltage- and time-dependent conductances and both electrical and chemical transmission among these cells. At the ultrastructural level, gap junctions, monad ribbon synapses, and conventional synapses, like those present in the intact retina, were observed in sibling cultures. Thus, all major classes of adult retinal neurons, in addition to ganglion cells, are able to regenerate processes and reform synapses. The regenerated synaptic contacts are functional and structurally diverse."
https://openalex.org/W1977889826,"Single-channel K+ currents were recorded from young and mature spinal neurons cultured from Xenopus embryos to examine the bases of the developmental increases in density and in rate of activation of the macroscopic voltage-dependent delayed rectifier K+ current (IKv). K+ channels of three conductance classes (integral of 80, 30, and 15 pS) are present at both ages, but only the intermediate and small conductance classes are voltage-dependent and thus underlie IKv. The increase in the density of IKv is due to increases in the numbers of intermediate and small channels per cell, but not to changes in their open probabilities. The increase in rate of activation of IKv results from a change in the activation kinetics of the intermediate channel class alone."

In low salt conditions, these particles release their double-stranded RNA and can then use added plus L-A or plus M1 single-stranded RNAs as templates to synthesize their respective double-stranded RNAs. The reaction requires dialyzed L-A virus-like particles as the source of the enzyme, a partially purified cell extract (host factor(s)), added single-stranded RNA as a template, and polyethylene glycol 6000, along with four NTPs. Crude host factor extracts prepared from mak3 or mak10ta mutants also support the reaction as effectively as that from a wild type strain, while a crude extract prepared from a pet18 mutant grown under the nonpermissive conditions is less effective. Template specificity of the in vitro reaction is the same as that expected for the enzyme reaction in vivo. Plus L-A and plus M1 single-stranded RNAs, but not 18 S rRNA, are converted to their respective double-stranded RNAs with net RNA synthesis. The newly synthesized strand of M1 double-stranded RNA is a full-length minus strand. This demonstration of replicase activity in the mature L-A virus-like particles which contain L-A double-stranded RNA is consistent with our previous L-A double-stranded RNA replication model; the difference between the mature L-A virus-like particles and L-A double-stranded RNA-synthesizing particles (expected to be replication intermediates in vivo) is just that the former contain L-A double-stranded RNA, while the latter contain L-A plus single-stranded RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2040734004,"cDNA clones of 7 low-abundance canary brain RNAs hybridize in situ to different subsets of brain cells. Although these cell sets are distinct, they are dispersed in a variety of brain regions with overlapping anatomical distributions. These cDNA clones were initially selected by their relative hybridization to forebrain and rest-of-brain RNAs and represent a sampling of a much larger population of differentially expressed RNAs present at individual concentrations of 10(-7) to 10(-4) as a fraction of polyadenylated RNA mass. Our results suggest the existence of several thousand low-abundance brain mRNAs likely to be distributed in diverse and overlapping brain cell subsets. Furthermore, our experiments define a simple and general strategy for producing and analyzing molecular probes for subsets of brain cells and provide an initial set of useful reagents for further study of brain organization and development."
https://openalex.org/W1537104524,"Two derivatives of erythromycin have been prepared carrying either an aryl azide or a 4-nitroguaiacol as a photoreactive group. Both derivatives bind to the specific erythromycin ribosomal site as shown by saturation and competition studies. The derivatives were isotopically labeled either with tritium or with 125I, and radioactivity is covalently incorporated to the ribosome upon irradiation at the appropriate wavelength. The ribosomal proteins labeled were identified by either mono- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis or high performance liquid chromatography. It has been found that protein L22 is the protein mainly, and under some conditions exclusively, labeled by the erythromycin derivatives. These results were confirmed using ribosomes from erythromycin-resistant mutants having a protein L22 with modified electrophoretical mobility. Protein L15 is also labeled in both cases, and the aromatic azide derivative labels to a lesser extent proteins L2 and L4. Competition experiments with erythromycin indicate that labeling in protein L22, and probably in L15, is specific, while the specificity of labeling in proteins L2 and L4 is questionable. These results indicate that the erythromycin derivatives label different ribosomal proteins than the spiramycin type of macrolides (Tejedor, F., and Ballesta, J.P.G. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 467) suggesting that the binding sites of both macrolide types are probably not identical."
https://openalex.org/W1487050642,"Three N-acyl derivatives of biotinylethylenediamine were prepared: I, biotinylamidoethyl-3-(3-[125I]iodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionamide; II, biotinylamidoethyl-[3H]acetamide; and III, biotinylamidoethyl-3-(3,5-[125I]diiodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionamid e. Each compound was combined with a large excess of avidin, yielding 1:1 molar complexes. Aside from a small fraction of each complex that dissociated more rapidly, the dissociation half-lives of these complexes were: I, 41 days; II, 4.4 days; and III, 148 days. The iodo- (mono or di) hydroxyphenylpropionyl moieties of I and III, therefore, contribute significantly to the binding strength of these compounds toward avidin. We also formed 4:1 complexes of I, II, and III with avidin (compound in excess), each of which exhibited biphasic dissociation, with initial half-lives of 4, 3.2, and 24 days, respectively. Thus, I or especially III potentially can be used as a sensitive tracer in quantitative studies with avidin."
https://openalex.org/W1541805215,"When recA protein promotes homologous pairing and strand exchange involving circular single strands and linear duplex DNA, the protein first polymerizes on the single-stranded DNA to form a nucleoprotein filament which then binds naked duplex DNA to form nucleoprotein networks, the existence of which is independent of homology, but requires the continued presence of recA protein (Tsang, S. S., Chow, S. A., and Radding, C. M. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 3226-3232). Further experiments revealed that within a few minutes after the beginning of homologous pairing and strand exchange, these networks began to be replaced by a distinct set of networks with inverse properties: their formation depended upon homology, but they survived removal of recA protein by a variety of treatments. Formation of this second kind of network required that homology be present specifically at the end of the linear duplex molecule from which strand exchange begins. Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein or phage T4 gene 32 protein largely suppressed the formation of this second population of networks by inactivating the newly formed heteroduplex DNA, which, however, could be reactivated when recA protein was dissociated by incubation at 0 degrees C. We interpret these observations as evidence of reinitiation of strand invasion when recA protein acts in the absence of auxiliary helix-destabilizing proteins. These observations indicate that the nature of the nucleoprotein products of strand exchange determines whether pairing and strand exchange are reversible or not, and they further suggest a new explanation for the way in which E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein and gene 32 protein accelerate the apparent forward rate of strand exchange promoted by recA protein, namely by suppressing initiation of the reverse reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1602887517,"The in vivo effect of insulin upon the incorporation of 32Pi into nuclear proteins was investigated in quiescent baby hamster kidney fibroblasts (BHK-21). Insulin has previously been shown to be mitogenic in these cells (Richman, R. A., Johnson, R. A., and Friedman, D. L. (1981) Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 168, 196-203). Incorporation into two proteins (Mr = 62,000 and 72,000) in the 0.4 M salt-resistant nuclear fraction was enhanced 2-6-fold by insulin. The effect of insulin (20 nM) was observable within 5 min of treatment, reached a maximum at 15 min, and continued for at least 90 min. The half-maximal effect of insulin was obtained at a concentration of approximately 1 nM. Analysis of nuclear matrix preparations indicated that the two insulin-sensitive proteins were prominent nuclear matrix proteins and suggested that they were lamins A and C. This was confirmed by immunostaining with lamin antibodies and by two-dimensional electrophoresis. These studies indicate that insulin rapidly stimulates the incorporation of phosphate into nuclear lamins A and C in quiescent BHK-21 fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1518520643,"Triethyl phosphate, dimethyl methylphosphonate, and the hypophosphite ion all contain the phosphoryl functional group. When added to an oxygenated erythrocyte suspension, the former compound gives rise to a single 31P NMR resonance, whereas the latter compounds give rise to separate intra- and extracellular 31P NMR resonances. On the basis of experiments with intact oxygenated cell suspensions (in which the hematocrit was varied) and with oxygenated cell lysates (in which the lysate concentration was varied), it was concluded that the chemical shifts of the intra- and extracellular populations of triethyl phosphate differ as a consequence of the diamagnetic susceptibility of intracellular oxyhemoglobin but that this difference is averaged by the rapid exchange of the compound across the cell membrane. The difference in the magnetic susceptibility of the intra- and extracellular compartments contributes to the observed separation of the intra- and extracellular resonances of dimethyl methylphosphonate and hypophosphite. The magnitude of this contribution is, however, substantially less than that calculated using a simple two-compartment model and varies with the hematocrit of the suspension. Furthermore, it is insufficient to fully account for the transmembrane chemical shift differences observed for dimethyl methylphosphonate and hypophosphite. An additional effect is operating to move the intracellular resonances of these compounds to a lower chemical shift. The effect is mediated by an intracellular component, and the magnitude of the resultant chemical shift variations depends upon the chemical structure of the phosphoryl compound involved."
https://openalex.org/W1483934669,The mechanism of superrepression by the mutant trp repressor EK49 was examined. This superrepressor has a glutamic acid-to-lysine change at residue 49. The purified EK49 trp repressor was found to have a 10-fold higher affinity than wild type repressor for trp operator DNA. This increased affinity was shown to be due to a decrease in dissociation rate. The binding of trp operator DNA by EK49 trp repressor in the filter binding assay was more sensitive to high salt concentrations than binding by wild type repressor.
https://openalex.org/W1528656836,"The Escherichia coli biotin operon repressor protein (BirA) has been overexpressed at the level of 0.5-1% of the total cellular protein from the plasmid pMBR10. Four lines of evidence demonstrated that authentic BirA protein was produced. First, birA plasmids complemented birA mutants for both the repressor and biotin holoenzyme synthetase activities of BirA. Second, biotin holoenzyme synthase activity was increased in strains containing the overproducing plasmids. Third, deletion of sequences flanking the birA gene did not alter production of the 35-kDa BirA protein, but insertion of oligonucleotide linkers within the birA coding region abolished it. Fourth, the 35-kDa protein copurified with the biotin binding activity normally associated with BirA. The birA protein has been purified to homogeneity in a three-step process involving chromatography on phosphocellulose and hydroxyapatite columns."
https://openalex.org/W1974663748,"Acetylcholine receptor (AChR)-like molecules are found in clusters on the surface of parasympathetic neurons in the frog cardiac ganglion. Electron microscopy of immunoperoxidase-stained tissue reveals that in normally innervated ganglia most of these clusters are located at synaptic sites. Denervation for 2-3 weeks results in a 64% reduction in the total surface area occupied by AChR-like clusters; this change is brought about by the combined effects of a 4-fold decrease in cluster size and a 30% increase in cluster number. Denervation also changes the distribution of AChR-like clusters: clusters, normally restricted to portions of the cell surface, are more widely distributed following denervation. Denervation of amphibian skeletal muscle for a comparable period of time has no effect on the size or the number of synaptic clusters of AChRs. These results suggest that AChRs in nerve and in muscle are regulated differently by innervation."
https://openalex.org/W2048366624,"Muscle satellite cells play an important role in the postnatal growth of skeletal muscle and in the regeneration of damaged muscle during adult life. Little is known about the physiological properties of satellite cells in their dormant state as they lie adjacent to the intact muscle fibers, underneath the basement membrane. Our recent experiments, using patch clamp techniques, indicate that no tight electrical coupling is present between satellite cells and the muscle fiber dissociated from rat flexor digitorum brevis. Satellite cells possess sodium channels with low sensitivity to tetrodotoxin and at a much lower density than muscle. In addition, satellite cells are insensitive to acetylcholine (ACh) for at least 24 hr after having been removed from the animal, even when detached from their muscle fiber. However, we could measure ACh-evoked currents from satellite cells 48–72 hr in culture, indicating that ACh sensitivity develops with time."
https://openalex.org/W1533050590,"Abstract We report the subcloning and characterization of the molecular elements necessary for the expression of the Escherichia coli valS gene which encodes the enzyme valyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.9). The valS gene was subcloned from the Clarke-Carbon plasmid pLC26-22 by genetic complementation of the valS temperature-sensitive mutant strain, AB4141. The protein-coding region of the valS structural gene was determined by in vitro DNA directed coupled transcription-translation assays. Assays of cellular extracts of cells transformed with a plasmid containing a full length copy of the valS gene enhanced in vivo valyl-tRNA synthetase-specific activity 12-fold. The DNA sequences of the 5'- and 3'-terminal regions of the valS structural gene are presented. The transcription initiation sites of the valS gene were determined, in vivo and in vitro, by S1 nuclease protection studies, primer-extension analysis and both alpha-32P labeled and gamma-32P-end-labeled in vitro transcription assays. In vivo, valS transcription initiates from tandem overlapping promoters separated by seven nucleotides. In vitro, only the upstream promoter is active. The presence of several regions of hyphenated dyad symmetry overlapping the tandem promoter region are noted. The valS translational start codon (AUG) is located 93 base pairs downstream from the major transcription initiation site. The valS transcriptional unit encodes only the valyl-tRNA synthetase gene since the 3' terminus of the amino acid-coding region of this gene is followed closely (26 base pairs) by an efficient rho-independent transcription termination site."
https://openalex.org/W1517770626,"We have found a wide occurrence of alpha,beta-diaminopropionate ammonia-lyase in bacteria and actinomycetes. Considerable amounts of this enzyme were found in Salmonella typhimurium. The enzyme was purified and crystallized from S. typhimurium (IFO 12529). The relative molecular mass of the native enzyme, estimated by the ultracentrifugal equilibrium method, is 89,000 Da, and the enzyme consists of two subunits identical in molecular mass. The enzyme exhibits absorption maxima at 278 and 413 nm and contains 2 mol of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate(pyridoxal-P)/mol of enzyme. The enzyme catalyzes the alpha,beta-elimination reaction of both L- and D-alpha,beta-diaminopropionate, the most suitable substrates, to form pyruvate and ammonia. The L- and D-isomers of serine were also degraded, though slowly. After the internal Schiff base with pyridoxal-P had been reduced with sodium borohydride, followed by trypsin or lysyl endopeptidase digestion of the enzyme, we determined the sequence of about 20 amino acid residues around the lysine residue which binds pyridoxal-P. No homology was found in either the amino acid sequence of the pyridoxal-P binding peptide or the amino-terminal amino acid sequence between the enzyme and other pyridoxal-P-dependent enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1595752687,"The signal sequence of the precursor of the Escherichia coli outer membrane protein OmpA was altered by oligonucleotide insertions into the corresponding gene. In one case, OmpA-S1, the hydrophobic core of the signal peptide, is reduced from 12 to 10 residues, and one positive charge is added near the NH2-terminus. In another case, OmpA-P1, the hydrophobic core is extended from 12 to 16 residues. The pro-OmpA protein is normally processed partially co- and partially posttranslationally. Processing of the pro-OmpA-S1 protein was entirely posttranslational and that of the pro-OmpA-P1 protein strictly cotranslational. Evidence is presented which strongly suggests that posttranslational processing reflects posttranslational translocation across the plasma membrane. The generation times of cells expressing pro-OmpA-P1 or pro-OmpA-S1 were identical and the pro-OmpA-S1 polypeptide could be chased into the mature protein in the absence of protein synthesis. Hence, it does not matter which mode of processing, or rather translocation, is used. The same oligonucleotides were inserted into the ompA gene of plasmid pRD87; a plasmid which leads to overproduction of the protein and to massive accumulation of both the mature protein and the precursor. In the OmpA signal sequence encoded by pRD87-P2 the hydrophobic core is extended from 12 to 20 residues. This peptide was also rapidly removed. Therefore, regardless of whether the hydrophobic core contains 12, 16, or 20 lipophilic residues, not only does the signal sequence always function correctly to mediate export, but in each case, the cleavage site is always accessible to the signal peptidase."
https://openalex.org/W1533889068,"The oxygen-evolving photosystem II particles prepared from spinach chloroplasts with brief sonication and Triton X-100 treatment were subjected to butanol/water phase partitioning. Three peripheral proteins of photosystem II having relative molecular masses of 33,000, 24,000, and 18,000 daltons and a part of the associated with photosystem II were partitioned into the aqueous phase, depending on the concentration of salt which was included in the suspension of the photosystem II particles. Quantitative analysis of the phase partitioning of the photosystem II particles under the various ionic conditions at pH 6.5 suggested the following: (a) two of the four of associated with photosystem II are located at a relatively environment and easily extracted from the membrane; (b) one of these hydrophilic atoms is structurally in close proximity to the protein of the relative molecular mass of 33,000 daltons and stabilized by the protein specifically; (c) the protein of the relative molecular mass of 24,000 daltons as well as that of 33,000 daltons is involved in the stabilization of the other hydrophilic manganese in the membrane; (d) each of the three proteins has an independent binding site on the membrane and organizes a specific catalytic domain where oxidation of water is carried out efficiently in collaboration with the reaction center of photosystem II."
https://openalex.org/W1583291817,"Abstract Leader peptidase, an integral transmembrane protein of Escherichia coli, is synthesized without a cleavable amino-terminal leader peptide. Of the five domains that participate in the membrane assembly of this protein, one is an internal region. We have used oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to examine the properties of the internal signal that are crucial for leader peptidase assembly. For this purpose, the net charge at the amino terminus of the internal signal was changed from +2 to +1 and -1 and, at the carboxyl terminus of the signal, from 0 to -1 or +1. These mutations had no effect on the membrane assembly of leader peptidase, suggesting that the charges have little role in the signal function. The apolar core of this signal was disrupted by substitution of basic amino acids for apolar residues. Substitution of an arginyl residue at position 70, or two arginyl residues at position 67 and 69, prevented membrane assembly. However, substitution of an arginyl residue at position 66 or either arginyl or lysyl residue at position 68 was without effect. Thus, while the apolar character of the internal signal is important, the precise position of a charged residue determines its effect on assembly."

https://openalex.org/W1668414261,"We examined the extent to which rates of enzymatic conversion of the oxytocin biosynthetic precursor to mature peptide are modulated by intramolecular and intermolecular assembly of precursor and polypeptide intermediates. The biosynthesized precursor contains hormone and neurophysin sequences linked by a Gly-Lys-Arg sequence and undergoes enzymatic processing reactions which include endoproteolytic cleavage at the Lys-Arg dibasic sequence, carboxypeptidase B-like exoproteolytic cleavage, and enzymatic amidation. We evaluated the effect of neurophysin on such processing reactions using semisynthetic precursors of oxytocin/bovine neurophysin I and synthetic oxytocinyl precursor intermediates as substrates. Neurophysin I at high concentration (0.7 mM) reduced the rates of carboxy-peptidase B-like conversion of oxytocinyl-Gly-Lys-Arg to oxytocinyl-Gly and the enzymatic amidation of oxytocinyl-Gly to mature (C-terminal amidated) oxytocin. The dependence of rate suppression on the concentrations of peptide substrate and neurophysin I suggested that suppression is due to intermolecular formation of hormone-neurophysin complexes which are aggregated at least to dimers. An analogous intramolecular neurophysin effect was found for endoproteolytic processing of semisynthetic precursors. Endoproteinase Lys-C cleaved the Lys11-Arg12 peptide bond in a native-like semisynthetic precursor at a significantly slower rate than it did an assembly-deficient precursor analogue. The difference in semisynthetic precursor endoproteolysis rates is most substantial at the high concentrations at which the native-like precursor would form dimers but the assembly-deficient analogue would not. The native-like semisynthetic precursor was more stable than the assembly-deficient precursor analogue to tryptic digestion. The concentration-dependent effects of neurophysin, both intramolecularly as a precursor domain and intermolecularly as an interacting protein, are likely to occur in the secretory granules in which the biosynthetic precursors are packaged. The molecular organization of both hormone/neurophysin precursors and the noncovalently complexed hormone-neurophysin intermediates can be expected to play a role in modulating enzymatic processing reactions that lead to mature neurohypophysial hormones."
