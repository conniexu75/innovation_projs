https://openalex.org/W2164695230,"The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been implemented in a variety of model organisms to mediate site-directed mutagenesis. A wide range of mutation rates has been reported, but at a limited number of genomic target sites. To uncover the rules that govern effective Cas9-mediated mutagenesis in zebrafish, we targeted over a hundred genomic loci for mutagenesis using a streamlined and cloning-free method. We generated mutations in 85% of target genes with mutation rates varying across several orders of magnitude, and identified sequence composition rules that influence mutagenesis. We increased rates of mutagenesis by implementing several novel approaches. The activities of poor or unsuccessful single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) initiating with a 5' adenine were improved by rescuing 5' end homogeneity of the sgRNA. In some cases, direct injection of Cas9 protein/sgRNA complex further increased mutagenic activity. We also observed that low diversity of mutant alleles led to repeated failure to obtain frame-shift mutations. This limitation was overcome by knock-in of a stop codon cassette that ensured coding frame truncation. Our improved methods and detailed protocols make Cas9-mediated mutagenesis an attractive approach for labs of all sizes."
https://openalex.org/W2058731507,"A novel extracellular thermo-alkali-stable laccase from Bacillus tequilensis SN4 (SN4LAC) was purified to homogeneity. The laccase was a monomeric protein of molecular weight 32 KDa. UV-visible spectrum and peptide mass fingerprinting results showed that SN4LAC is a multicopper oxidase. Laccase was active in broad range of phenolic and non-phenolic substrates. Catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) showed that 2, 6-dimethoxyphenol was most efficiently oxidized by the enzyme. The enzyme was inhibited by conventional inhibitors of laccase like sodium azide, cysteine, dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol. SN4LAC was found to be highly thermostable, having temperature optimum at 85°C and could retain more than 80% activity at 70°C for 24 h. The optimum pH of activity for 2, 6-dimethoxyphenol, 2, 2'-azino bis[3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate], syringaldazine and guaiacol was 8.0, 5.5, 6.5 and 8.0 respectively. Enzyme was alkali-stable as it retained more than 75% activity at pH 9.0 for 24 h. Activity of the enzyme was significantly enhanced by Cu2+, Co2+, SDS and CTAB, while it was stable in the presence of halides, most of the other metal ions and surfactants. The extracellular nature and stability of SN4LAC in extreme conditions such as high temperature, pH, heavy metals, halides and detergents makes it a highly suitable candidate for biotechnological and industrial applications."
https://openalex.org/W2056400389,"The chemical uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) was an effective and widely used weight loss drug in the early 1930s. However, the physiology of DNP has not been studied in detail because toxicity, including hyperthermia and death, reduced interest in the clinical use of chemical uncouplers. To investigate DNP action, mice fed a high fat diet and housed at 30 °C (to minimize facultative thermogenesis) were treated with 800 mg/liter DNP in drinking water. DNP treatment increased energy expenditure by ∼17%, but did not change food intake. DNP-treated mice weighed 26% less than controls after 2 months of treatment due to decreased fat mass, without a change in lean mass. DNP improved glucose tolerance and reduced hepatic steatosis without observed toxicity. DNP treatment also reduced circulating T3 and T4 levels, Ucp1 expression, and brown adipose tissue activity, demonstrating that DNP-mediated heat generation substituted for brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. At 22 °C, a typical vivarium temperature that is below thermoneutrality, DNP treatment had no effect on body weight, adiposity, or glucose homeostasis. Thus, environmental temperature should be considered when assessing an anti-obesity drug in mice, particularly agents acting on energy expenditure. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of DNP suggest that chemical uncouplers deserve further investigation for the treatment of obesity and its comorbidities.

Thus, environmental temperature should be considered when assessing an anti-obesity drug in mice, particularly agents acting on energy expenditure. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of DNP suggest that chemical uncouplers deserve further investigation for the treatment of obesity and its comorbidities. Obesity prevalence is ∼35% in the United States and ∼20% in Europe and is increasing worldwide (1Ogden C.L. Carroll M.D. Kit B.K. Flegal K.M.

European Commission, Brussels2010Google Scholar). Obesity contributes to serious comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Despite the epidemic's magnitude, few effective therapeutic options exist. Current treatments with diet, exercise, and behavior modification work well in the short term but have a low long term success rate (3Kraschnewski J.L. Boan J. Esposito J. Sherwood N.E. Lehman E.B.

Bariatric surgery is effective, but it is invasive and supported by limited long term (decades) safety and efficacy data. Pharmacotherapies for obesity are also meager. One modestly effective drug, orlistat, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1999, and two others (lorcaserin and phentermine/topiramate) were approved in 2012. The effect of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) 3The abbreviations used are: DNP2,4-dinitrophenolBATbrown adipose tissueHFDhigh fat dietRERrespiratory exchange ratioTaenvironmental temperatureTbcore body temperatureTEEtotal energy expenditureWATwhite adipose tissueHOMA-IRhomeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance. to increase metabolic rate has been known since the late 1800s and was studied during World War I (4Perkins R.G. A study of the munitions intoxications in France.Pub. Health Rep. 1919; 34: 2335-2374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the early 1930s, DNP was widely used as a weight loss drug (5Tainter M.L. Stockton A.B. Cutting W.C. Dinitrophenol in the treatment of obesity.JAMA. 1935; 105: 332-336Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar); however, enthusiasm for DNP therapy waned due to its low therapeutic index and serious toxicities, including hyperthermia, skin reactions, cataracts, and death (6Colman E. Dinitrophenol and obesity: an early twentieth-century regulatory dilemma.Regul. Toxicol. Pharmacol. 2007; 48: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 7Grundlingh J. Dargan P.I.

In 1948, its mechanism of action was discovered, revealing that DNP is a protonophore, able to move protons through lipid bilayers and thus to chemically uncouple substrate oxidation from ATP production (8Loomis W.F. Lipmann F. Reversible inhibition of the coupling between phosphorylation and oxidation.J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 173: 807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mammals naturally use an uncoupling protein in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and beige/brite adipose tissue to generate heat to maintain core body temperature (Tb). Thus, BAT and beige/brite adipose tissue activation is of interest as a component of drug therapy for obesity (9Nedergaard J. Cannon B.

Facultative thermogenesis persists in Ucp1 null mice, which lack BAT function, suggesting a role for other tissues, such as muscle (11Enerback S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H.

However, although facultative thermogenesis is extremely important in small mammals, both thermogenic need and capacity in adult humans are much lower than in mice. Therefore, using a chemical uncoupler that is presumably active in all tissues might be a complementary approach to obesity pharmacotherapy, avoiding the constraint that there is limited facultative thermogenesis in adult humans. 2,4-dinitrophenol brown adipose tissue high fat diet respiratory exchange ratio environmental temperature core body temperature total energy expenditure white adipose tissue homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance. Mice are a useful model system to study human obesity physiology and treatment due to the conserved biology, plethora of genetic tools, and modest resources (compounds, housing) required. However, the profound differences in thermal biology (14Gordon C.J. Thermal physiology of laboratory mice: defining thermoneutrality.J. Thermal Biol. 2012; 37: 654-685Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar) have not typically been considered when studying obesity physiology and treatment (15Overton J.M. Phenotyping small animals as models for the human metabolic syndrome: thermoneutrality matters.Int. J. Obes. (Lond.). 2010; 34: S53-S58Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Given the need for improved obesity pharmacotherapy and the dearth of data on chemical uncouplers, we investigated the physiological effects of chemical uncoupling in mice, using DNP as a model compound. While doing so, we also examined the effect of ambient temperature (comparing 30 °C, which is approximately thermoneutral for mice, with 22 °C, which is below thermoneutrality (16Herrington L.P. The heat regulation of small laboratory animals at various environmental temperatures.Am. J. Physiol. 1940; 129: 123-139Crossref Google Scholar, 17Mount L.E.

Female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were housed at 4 per cage, unless otherwise indicated, at 22 or 30 °C with ad libitum access to water and high fat diet (D12492, 60% kcal fat, 5.24 metabolizable kcal/g; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) starting at 6 weeks of age with a 12-h/12-h dark/light cycle (lights on at 0600 h). Female mice can be housed together and were used due to limited capacity for thermoneutral housing. Body weight, food intake, and water intake were measured twice weekly. DNP (800 mg/liter; Sigma-Aldrich) treatment began when mice were ∼6–8 weeks old. DNP was neutralized with NaOH, protected from light, administered in drinking water, and changed twice weekly. DNP was kept moist, and skin/mucous membrane contact was avoided. DNP concentrations were measured assuming a molar extinction coefficient of 10,356 m−1 cm−1 at 400 nm in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Tap water adjusted to pH 7.0 was vehicle. Protocols were approved by the NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Male diet-induced obese C57BL/6J mice were also tested at 30 °C with DNP in drinking water and were housed at 2 per cage. Indirect calorimetry was performed with access to food and water using a 12-chamber environment controlled CLAMS system (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Female mice were treated with DNP or vehicle at 22 or 30 °C for 6 weeks. Treatment was continued in the chambers, and the chamber temperature was 30 °C for all groups. To minimize thermal deconditioning of the 22 °C groups while providing sufficient time for familiarization to the chambers, mice were placed into the indirect calorimetry chambers at 1700 h, and baseline EE was measured at 0800–1000 h the next day. CL316243 (0.1 mg/kg intraperitoneally in saline; Sigma-Aldrich) was dosed at 1100 h. Body composition was measured by time domain EchoMRI 3-in-1 (Echo Medical Systems, Houston, TX). Rectal temperatures were measured using a digital thermometer (YSI 455, Measurement Specialties, Shrewsbury, MA). Intraperitoneal glucose (2g/kg, after a 16-h fast, with AUC calculated from 0 mg/dl) and insulin tolerance (0.75 units/kg, ad libitum fed) tests were performed at 0930 h. Glucose was measured with a Glucometer Contour (Bayer, Mishawaka, IN). Liver triglyceride was measured as glycerol after NaOH hydrolysis (Cayman Chemical, catalog no. 10010755). Mice were anesthetized (100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine, intraperitoneally), bled retro-orbitally, and serum was frozen until assayed using the following kits. Free fatty acids (Roche Applied Science), triglycerides (Pointe Scientific Inc., Canton, MI), cholesterol (Thermo Scientific), β-hydroxybutyrate (BioVision, Milpitas, CA), acetoacetate (BioVision), and d-lactate (BioVision) were measured by colorimetric assays. Insulin (Millipore, St. Charles, MO), adiponectin (Millipore), insulin-like growth factor 1 (ALPCO, Salem, NH), T3 (DiaSorin Inc., Stillwater, MN), and T4 (DiaSorin) were measured by radioimmune assay. Leptin (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and fibroblast growth factor 21 (Millipore) were measured by ELISA. RNA was extracted (Qiagen RNeasy Plus Mini Kit, Germantown, MD), converted to cDNA (Roche Transcriptor High Fidelity cDNA Synthesis Kit, Indianapolis, IN), and quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (7900HT, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using SYBR Green.

Open table in a new tab Protein from BAT was prepared using radioimmune assay precipitation buffer and quantified (Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Protein (10 μg/lane) was separated in 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to PVDF membrane, and probed with anti-UCP1 antibody (1:5000; U6382, Sigma-Aldrich) or anti-α-tubulin (1:5000; T6074, Sigma-Aldrich). Signals were detected with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific), using exposure times appropriate to signal intensity. Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, blocked in paraffin wax, and sectioned. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined by light microscopy. Data were analyzed using unpaired Student's t tests or analysis of variance with Tukey's honestly significant difference post-hoc testing using Sigmaplot version 12.5 (Systat Software Inc.). Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Preliminary dose-ranging experiments at thermoneutrality demonstrated that a dose of 800 mg/liter DNP in drinking water (∼89 mg/kg/day) reduced body weight without affecting food or water intake or causing noticeable changes in behavior. This dose was used for all experiments because higher DNP doses reduced water and food intake, possibly an aversive effect, whereas lower doses did not affect body weight (Fig. 1). We treated female C57BL/6J mice with DNP for 8 weeks at 30 °C on a high fat diet. DNP-treated mice weighed 18% (p < 0.05) less than vehicle-treated mice, with no effect on food intake (Fig. 2, A and B). DNP treatment reduced fat mass with no change in lean mass (Fig. 2C). Free-living total energy expenditure (TEE), calculated by energy balance, from the caloric intake, change in body weight, and change in body composition (18Ravussin Y. Gutman R. LeDuc C.A. Leibel R.L. Estimating energy expenditure in mice using an energy balance technique.Int. J. Obes. (Lond.). 2013; 37: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), was increased by 13% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2D). DNP treatment lowered fed and fasting glucose levels and HOMA-IR and improved glucose tolerance, with no obvious effect on insulin tolerance (Fig. 2, E–K). Treatment with DNP in male diet-induced obese mice showed similar effects on body weight and composition, food intake, and TEE over 2 weeks (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Effects of DNP treatment in male C57BL/6J mice.

Vehicle-treated mice gained more weight at 30 °C than at 22 °C (Fig. 4A), consistent with prior reports (19Rippe C. Berger K. Böiers C. Ricquier D. Erlanson-Albertsson C.

At 30 °C, DNP-treated mice weighed 23% less than vehicle-treated controls, due to reduced fat mass with little change in lean mass (Fig. 4, C and D). In contrast, at 22 °C DNP had no effect on body weight or fat mass. Mice at 22 °C ate 23% more than mice housed at 30 °C, with no DNP effect on food (Fig. 4B) or water intake (not shown). We used the energy balance technique to measure free living TEE (18Ravussin Y. Gutman R. LeDuc C.A. Leibel R.L. Estimating energy expenditure in mice using an energy balance technique.Int. J. Obes. (Lond.). 2013; 37: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Over 5 weeks of treatment, the free living TEE of the vehicle groups at 22 °C was 32% greater than at 30 °C. At 30 °C, DNP treatment increased TEE by 16%, whereas at 22 °C, DNP treatment had no effect on free living TEE (Fig. 4E). Next, we used indirect calorimetry to measure the effect of DNP on metabolic rate and thermogenic capacity. These experiments were performed at thermoneutrality to remove the contribution of facultative thermogenesis. To minimize thermal deconditioning of the 22 °C groups while providing sufficient acclimatization time, mice were placed in the metabolic chambers 13 h before baseline measurements. DNP treatment increased baseline TEE measured at thermoneutrality (Table 2). In the 30 °C groups, the DNP-mediated metabolic rate increase, compared with vehicle-treated controls, was 6% per mouse (0.209/0.196, p = not significant), 37% per g of body weight (8.82/9.46, p = 0.009), 28% per (g of body weight)0.75 (19.4/15.1, p = 0.02), or 11–13% using a statistical model. Comparing the 22 °C groups (where the DNP-treated and vehicle groups have the same body weight), the mean DNP-mediated increase was 17% (0.237/0.202, p = 0.05) above the light phase thermoneutral metabolic rate. There were no differences in RER (respiratory exchange ratio, the ratio of CO2 produced to O2 consumed, which indicates metabolic fuel type) or physical activity.TABLE 2Effect of CL316243 in DNP-treated mice30 °C vehicle30 °C DNP22 °C vehicle22 °C DNPTemperatureDrugT × DBody weight (g)30.9 ± 1.623.8 ± 0.927.5 ± 1.227.4 ± 1.50.010.01Baseline (pre-CL316243)TEE (kcal/h/mouse)0.196 ± 0.0060.209 ± 0.0140.202 ± 0.0100.237 ± 0.0130.047TEE (kcal/h/body weight)6.46 ± 0.368.82 ± 0.697.42 ± 0.448.86 ± 0.750.003TEE (kcal/h/body weight0.75)15.1 ± 0.719.4 ± 1.416.9 ± 0.920.1 ± 1.50.004RER0.764 ± 0.0120.756 ± 0.0060.758 ± 0.0050.754 ± 0.006Activity (beam breaks/13 min)174 ± 29204 ± 37191 ± 34225 ± 23TEE (kcal/h/mean mouse)0.2260.2510.2300.268<0.0001TEE (kcal/h/median mouse)0.1850.2080.1890.228<0.0001After CL316243TEE (kcal/h/mouse)0.350 ± 0.0090.286 ± 0.0170.419 ± 0.0180.433 ± 0.015<0.0010.02TEE, ratio to baseline1.79 ± 0.071.45 ± 0.192.09 ± 0.101.85 ± 0.080.0060.02RER0.707 ± 0.0070.716 ± 0.0050.702 ± 0.0030.717 ± 0.010 Open table in a new tab CL316243, a selective β3-adrenoreceptor agonist, was used in thermoneutral conditions to maximally stimulate BAT thermogenesis and WAT lipolysis, assaying the capacity for facultative thermogenesis (22Susulic V.S.

In all groups, CL316243 caused a drop in RER to ∼0.71, indicating that fatty acids were the predominant energy source. In vehicle-treated mice, TEE stabilized after CL316243 treatment at increases of 79 ± 7 and 109 ± 10% over baseline in the mice that were chronically maintained at 30 and 22 °C, respectively (p = 0.03, 30 °C versus 22 °C). The smaller TEE increase with chronic 30 °C exposure is probably due to the reduced capacity for BAT activation. Surprisingly, in DNP-treated mice, acute CL316243 treatment had a qualitatively different effect, a large acute increase in TEE (due to fat oxidation because the RER is ∼0.71), which then diminished gradually. By ∼5 h after drug dosing, the 30 °C DNP TEE was lower than the 30 °C vehicle controls. DNP treatment increases metabolic rate measured at thermoneutrality in both the 22 and 30 °C Ta groups. Our interpretation is that at 22 °C, the DNP-mediated increase in metabolic rate is quantitatively offset by a reduction in facultative thermogenesis, so there is no net change in TEE. With an unchanged TEE and food intake, there was no effect on body weight. In contrast, upon chronic adaptation to 30 °C, there is little ongoing BAT thermogenesis to suppress, so the DNP-mediated increase in metabolic rate increases the TEE. At 30 °C, the TEE increase caused by DNP was not compensated for by increased food intake; thus, weight loss ensued. The BAT phenotype was investigated to see if it supports the above interpretations. In vehicle-treated mice, BAT had larger lipid droplets at 30 °C, consistent with the greater adiposity of the mice (Fig. 6A). BAT at 22 °C had higher Ucp1 mRNA and protein levels compared with the 30 °C vehicle group, indicating greater activation (Fig. 6, B and C). However, other mRNA markers of BAT activation (Prdm16, Cidea, Dio2, and Fgf21) or mitochondrial function/mass (CytoC and Cox8b mRNAs; mitochondrial DNA) were not significantly increased, consistent with a relatively modest activation of BAT (Fig. 6, C and D). DNP treatment at 30 °C reduced Ucp1, Prdm16, Cidea, Dio2, and Fgf21 mRNA levels. Other mitochondrial markers were also reduced, either significantly (Cox8b mRNA) or non-significantly (CytoC mRNA and mitochondrial DNA). At 22 °C, DNP tended to reduce BAT activation markers but not to the level seen at 30 °C (Fig. 6, A–D). No consistent changes in BAT mitochondrial appearance were seen with electron microscopy (data not shown). Leptin mRNA in WAT and serum levels reflected the underlying adiposity, being reduced by DNP versus vehicle at 30 °C and were proportional to each other and body weight/fat mass (Fig. 7) (data not shown). No changes in WAT mRNA markers of browning were detected. Adiponectin levels did not differ between the groups (Fig. 7). Igf-1 levels were higher at 22 °C versus 30 °C (p = 0.001), with no effect of DNP treatment. Fgf21 concentrations were variable but appeared to be reduced by DNP. DNP treatment decreased serum T3 and T4 levels at both temperatures (p < 0.005) (Fig. 7). At 30 °C, DNP treatment reduced liver weight by 13% (p = 0.058), due to reduced hepatic steatosis, with a 49% reduction in triglyceride amount (p = 0.02) (Fig. 8, A–C). DNP-treated livers showed no histological evidence of injury. Indeed, at 30 °C, DNP treatment actually reduced alanine aminotransferase levels by 32% (p = 0.002; Fig. 8D). Although DNP treatment might be predicted to induce mitochondrial function to compensate for less efficient ATP production, we observed that DNP had no effect on liver mRNA levels of Pgc1α or Pgc1β, transcription factors that stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis, Cox5b (Fig. 8E), or mitochondrial DNA levels (data not shown). Liver mRNA levels of metabolic proteins were similar among the four treatment groups; only Fgf21 and Mcad mRNA levels were higher at 22 °C versus 30 °C in vehicle-treated mice. DNP treatment reduced Scd1 mRNA at both temperatures. Serum β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and triglyceride levels were increased in DNP-treated mice maintained at 30 °C, whereas no change was observed in free fatty acid, lactate, or cholesterol levels (Fig. 8, F and G). Additionally, there was no change in the β-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratio, suggesting that the liver mitochondrial redox state was not significantly altered by DNP treatment. No difference in rectal body temperature (Tb) was observed in mice fed a HFD at 22 °C. At 30 °C, results were inconsistent, with DNP treatment sometimes increasing Tb, possibly more so during handling. Rectal Tb was more systematically monitored in singly housed, chow-fed male C57BL/6J mice at 30 °C treated with DNP or vehicle (n = 8/group). Light phase Tb was measured on 12 of 21 days, and the global mean Tb was 0.22 °C higher in the DNP-treated mice (36.53 ± 0.06 °C versus 36.31 ± 0.06 °C; p = 0.006). These results suggest that DNP treatment can slightly increase Tb at 30 °C. We studied the effect of chronic DNP treatment in mice housed below (22 °C) and at (30 °C) thermoneutrality. Below thermoneutrality, a DNP dose that increased thermoneutral metabolic rate by ∼17% had no effect on TEE, body weight, or adiposity. Our results suggest that in mice maintained below thermoneutrality, the increase in energy expenditure generated by DNP-mediated uncoupling can be compensated for by reducing BAT thermogenesis. At thermoneutrality, this compensatory mechanism is absent due to the fact that BAT and other sources of facultative thermogenesis are virtually inactive in thermoneutral conditions. Therefore, at thermoneutrality, DNP treatment increases TEE, leading to reduced body weight, adiposity, and hepatic steatosis and improved glucose tolerance. No attenuation in efficacy or clear toxic effects of DNP treatment were observed. Recently, a DNP prodrug that is activated in the liver was reported, which also improved hepatic steatosis and glucose homeostasis and did so with an improved therapeutic index (26Perry R.J. Kim T. Zhang X.M. Lee H.Y. Pesta D. Popov V.B. Zhang D. Rahimi Y. Jurczak M.J. Cline G.W. Spiegel D.A. Shulman G.I.

Its effects at thermoneutrality were not investigated. Chronic DNP treatment reduced circulating thyroid hormone levels, the principal regulator of basal metabolic rate (27Du Bois E.F.

https://openalex.org/W2023929579,"Our previous work demonstrated that application of a bio-organic fertilizer (BIO) to a banana mono-culture orchard with serious Fusarium wilt disease effectively decreased the number of soil Fusarium sp. and controlled the soil-borne disease. Because bacteria are an abundant and diverse group of soil organisms that responds to soil health, deep 16 S rRNA pyrosequencing was employed to characterize the composition of the bacterial community to investigate how it responded to BIO or the application of other common composts and to explore the potential correlation between bacterial community, BIO application and Fusarium wilt disease suppression. After basal quality control, 137,646 sequences and 9,388 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained from the 15 soil samples. Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Gemmatimonadetes and Actinobacteria were the most frequent phyla and comprised up to 75.3% of the total sequences. Compared to the other soil samples, BIO-treated soil revealed higher abundances of Gemmatimonadetes and Acidobacteria, while Bacteroidetes were found in lower abundance. Meanwhile, on genus level, higher abundances compared to other treatments were observed for Gemmatimonas and Gp4. Correlation and redundancy analysis showed that the abundance of Gemmatimonas and Sphingomonas and the soil total nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen content were higher after BIO application, and they were all positively correlated with disease suppression. Cumulatively, the reduced Fusarium wilt disease incidence that was seen after BIO was applied for 1-year might be attributed to the general suppression based on a shift within the bacteria soil community, including specific enrichment of Gemmatimonas and Sphingomonas."
https://openalex.org/W2031661014,"Background The river Göta Älv is a source of freshwater for 0.7 million swedes. The river is subject to contamination from sewer systems discharge and runoff from agricultural lands. Climate models projects an increase in precipitation and heavy rainfall in this region. This study aimed to determine how daily rainfall causes variation in indicators of pathogen loads, to increase knowledge of variations in river water quality and discuss implications for risk management. Methods Data covering 7 years of daily monitoring of river water turbidity and concentrations of E. coli, Clostridium and coliforms were obtained, and their short-term variations in relation with precipitation were analyzed with time series regression and non-linear distributed lag models. We studied how precipitation effects varied with season and compared different weather stations for predictive ability. Results Generally, the lowest raw water quality occurs 2 days after rainfall, with poor raw water quality continuing for several more days. A rainfall event of >15 mm/24-h (local 95 percentile) was associated with a three-fold higher concentration of E. coli and 30% higher turbidity levels (lag 2). Rainfall was associated with exponential increases in concentrations of indicator bacteria while the effect on turbidity attenuated with very heavy rainfall. Clear associations were also observed between consecutive days of wet weather and decreased water quality. The precipitation effect on increased levels of indicator bacteria was significant in all seasons. Conclusions Rainfall elevates microbial risks year-round in this river and freshwater source and acts as the main driver of varying water quality. Heavy rainfall appears to be a better predictor of fecal pollution than water turbidity. An increase of wet weather and extreme events with climate change will lower river water quality even more, indicating greater challenges for drinking water producers, and suggesting better control of sources of pollution."
https://openalex.org/W2108744331,"Bacterial microcompartments are large proteinaceous assemblies that are found in the cytoplasm of some bacteria. These structures consist of proteins constituting a shell that houses a number of enzymes involved in specific metabolic processes. The 1,2-propanediol-utilizing microcompartment is assembled from seven different types of shell proteins, one of which is PduA. It is one of the more abundant components of the shell and intriguingly can form nanotubule-like structures when expressed on its own in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. We propose a model that accounts for the size and appearance of these PduA structures and underpin our model using a combinatorial approach. Making strategic mutations at Lys-26, Val-51, and Arg-79, we targeted residues predicted to be important for PduA assembly. We present the effect of the amino acid residue substitution on the phenotype of the PduA higher order assemblies (transmission electron microscopy) and the crystal structure of the K26D mutant with one glycerol molecule bound to the central pore. Our results support the view that the hexamer-hexamer interactions seen in PduA crystals persist in the cytoplasmic structures and reveal the profound influence of the two key amino acids, Lys-26 and Arg-79, on tiling, not only in the crystal lattice but also in the bacterial cytoplasm. Understanding and controlling PduA assemblies is valuable in order to inform manipulation for synthetic biology and biotechnological applications."
https://openalex.org/W1993436216,"Osteopontin (OPN) is a multifunctional extracellular matrix (ECM) protein involved in multiple physiological processes. OPN expression is dramatically increased in visceral adipose tissue in obesity and the lack of OPN protects against the development of insulin resistance and inflammation in mice. We sought to unravel the potential mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of the absence of OPN. We analyzed the effect of the lack of OPN in the development of obesity and hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) using OPN-KO mice. OPN expression was upregulated in epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT) and liver in wild type (WT) mice with HFD. OPN-KO mice had higher insulin sensitivity, lower body weight and fat mass with reduced adipose tissue ECM remodeling and reduced adipocyte size than WT mice under a HFD. Reduced MMP2 and MMP9 activity was involved in the decreased ECM remodeling. Crown-like structure number in EWAT as well as F4/80-positive cells and Emr1 expression in EWAT and liver increased with HFD, while OPN-deficiency blunted the increase. Moreover, our data show for the first time that OPN-KO under a HFD mice display reduced fibrosis in adipose tissue and liver, as well as reduced oxidative stress in adipose tissue. Gene expression of collagens Col1a1, Col6a1 and Col6a3 in EWAT and liver, as well as the profibrotic cytokine Tgfb1 in EWAT were increased with HFD, while OPN-deficiency prevented this increase. OPN deficiency prevented hepatic steatosis via reduction in the expression of molecules involved in the onset of fat accumulation such as Pparg, Srebf1, Fasn, Mogat1, Dgat2 and Cidec. Furthermore, OPN-KO mice exhibited higher body temperature and improved BAT function. The present data reveal novel mechanisms of OPN in the development of obesity, pointing out the inhibition of OPN as a promising target for the treatment of obesity and fatty liver."
https://openalex.org/W1982925338,"The Arctic climate is changing at an unprecedented rate. What consequences this may have on the Arctic marine ecosystem depends to a large degree on how its species will respond both directly to elevated temperatures and more indirectly through ecological interactions. But despite an alarming recent warming of the Arctic with accompanying sea ice loss, reports evaluating ecological impacts of climate change in the Arctic remain sparse. Here, based upon a large-scale field study, we present basic new knowledge regarding the life history traits for one of the most important species in the entire Arctic, the polar cod (Boreogadus saida). Furthermore, by comparing regions of contrasting climatic influence (domains), we present evidence as to how its growth and reproductive success is impaired in the warmer of the two domains. As the future Arctic is predicted to resemble today's Atlantic domains, we forecast changes in growth and life history characteristics of polar cod that will lead to alteration of its role as an Arctic keystone species. This will in turn affect community dynamics and energy transfer in the entire Arctic food chain."
https://openalex.org/W2014707681,"In the present study we show that luxS of Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003 is involved in the production of the interspecies signaling molecule autoinducer-2 (AI-2), and that this gene is essential for gastrointestinal colonization of a murine host, while it is also involved in providing protection against Salmonella infection in Caenorhabditis elegans. We demonstrate that a B. breve luxS-insertion mutant is significantly more susceptible to iron chelators than the WT strain and that this sensitivity can be partially reverted in the presence of the AI-2 precursor DPD. Furthermore, we show that several genes of an iron starvation-induced gene cluster, which are downregulated in the luxS-insertion mutant and which encodes a presumed iron-uptake system, are transcriptionally upregulated under in vivo conditions. Mutation of two genes of this cluster in B. breve UCC2003 renders the derived mutant strains sensitive to iron chelators while deficient in their ability to confer gut pathogen protection to Salmonella-infected nematodes. Since a functional luxS gene is present in all tested members of the genus Bifidobacterium, we conclude that bifidobacteria operate a LuxS-mediated system for gut colonization and pathogen protection that is correlated with iron acquisition."

The second aim of this study was to examine the predictive performance of the selected metabolites for both early onset [EO-PE] and late onset PE [LO-PE].This was a case-control study of maternal serum samples collected between 8+0 and 13+6 weeks of gestation from 167 women who subsequently developed EO-PE n = 68; LO-PE n = 99 and 500 controls with uncomplicated pregnancies. Metabolomics profiling analysis was performed using two methods. One has been optimized to target eicosanoids/oxylipins, which are known inflammation markers and the other targets compounds containing a primary or secondary biogenic amine group. Logistic regression analyses were performed to predict the development of PE using metabolites alone and in combination with first trimester mean arterial pressure (MAP) measurements.Two metabolites were significantly different between EO-PE and controls (taurine and asparagine) and one in case of LO-PE (glycylglycine). Taurine appeared the most discriminative biomarker and in combination with MAP predicted EO-PE with a detection rate (DR) of 55%, at a false-positive rate (FPR) of 10%.Our findings suggest a potential role of taurine in both PE pathophysiology and first trimester screening for EO-PE."
https://openalex.org/W1985062956,"Lipids are major sources of metabolic energy in sharks and are closely linked to environmental conditions and biological cycles, such as those related to diet, reproduction and migration. In this study, we report for the first time, the total lipid content, lipid class composition and fatty acid profiles of muscle and liver tissue of white sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, of various lengths (1.5–3.9 m), sampled at two geographically separate areas off southern and eastern Australia. Muscle tissue was low in total lipid content (<0.9% wet mass, wm) and was dominated by phospholipids (>90% of total lipid) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (34±12% of total fatty acids). In contrast, liver was high in total lipid which varied between 51–81% wm and was dominated by triacylglycerols (>93%) and monounsaturated fatty acids (36±12%). With knowledge of total lipid and dry tissue mass, we estimated the energy density of muscle (18.4±0.1 kJ g−1 dm) and liver (34.1±3.2 kJ g−1 dm), demonstrating that white sharks have very high energetic requirements. High among-individual variation in these biochemical parameters and related trophic markers were observed, but were not related to any one biological or environmental factor. Signature fatty acid profiles suggest that white sharks over the size range examined are generalist predators with fish, elasmobranchs and mammalian blubber all contributing to the diet. The ecological applications and physiological influences of lipids in white sharks are discussed along with recommendations for future research, including the use of non-lethal sampling to examine the nutritional condition, energetics and dietary relationships among and between individuals. Such knowledge is fundamental to better understand the implications of environmental perturbations on this iconic and threatened species."
https://openalex.org/W1986649427,"Connexin43 (Cx43) is the most abundant gap junction protein in higher vertebrate organisms and has been shown to be involved in junctional and non-junctional functions. In addition to the expression of full-length Cx43, endogenously produced carboxyl-terminal segments of Cx43 have been described and have been suggested to be involved in manifold biological functions, such as hypoxic preconditioning and neuronal migration. Molecular aspects, however, behind the separate generation of carboxyl-terminal segments of Cx43 have remained elusive. Here we report on a mechanism that may play a key role in the separate production of these domains. First, stringent evidence derived from siRNA treatment and specific knockouts revealed significant loss of the low molecular weight fragments of Cx43. By applying a dicistronic vector strategy on transfected cell lines, we were able to identify putative IRES activity (nucleotides 442–637) in the coding region of Cx43, which resides upstream from the nucleotide sequence encoding the carboxyl terminus (nucleotides 637–1149). Functional responsiveness of the endogenous expression of Cx43 fragments to hypoxic/ischemic treatment was evaluated in in vitro and in vivo models, which led to a significant increase of the fastest migrating form (20 kDa) under conditions of metabolic deprivation. By nano-MS spectrometry, we achieved stringent evidence of the identity of the 20-kDa segment as part of the carboxyl-terminal domain of full-length Cx43. Our data prove the existence of endogenously expressed carboxyl-terminal domains, which may serve as valuable tools for further translational application in ischemic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2014220737,"Background Recent studies report the importance of metabolic health beyond obesity. The aim of this study is to compare the risk for diabetes development according to different status of metabolic health and obesity over a median follow-up of 48.7 months. Methods 6,748 non-diabetic subjects (mean age 43 years) were divided into four groups according to the baseline metabolic health and obesity status: metabolically healthy non-obese (MHNO), metabolically healthy obese (MHO), metabolically unhealthy non-obese (MUHNO) and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUHO). Being metabolically healthy was defined by having less than 2 components among the 5 components, that is, high blood pressure, high fasting blood glucose, high triglyceride, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and being in the highest decile of homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index. Obesity status was assessed by body mass index (BMI) higher than 25 kg/m2. The development of diabetes was assessed annually from self-questionnaire, fasting glucose and HbA1c. Results At baseline, 45.3% of the subjects were MHNO, 11.3% were MHO, 21.7% were MUHNO, and 21.7% were MUHO. During a median follow-up of 48.7 months, 277 subject (4.1%) developed diabetes. The hazard ratio for diabetes development was 1.338 in MHO group (95% CI 0.67–2.672), 4.321 in MUHNO group (95% CI 2.702–6.910) and 5.994 in MUHO group (95% CI 3.561–10.085) when MHNO group was considered as the reference group. These results were similar after adjustment for the changes of the risk factors during the follow-up period. Conclusion The risk for future diabetes development was higher in metabolically unhealthy subgroups compared with those of metabolically healthy subjects regardless of obesity status."

This excess energy can be harvested through biophotovoltaic platforms to generate electrical energy. In this study, algal biofilms formed on ITO anodes were investigated for use in the algal biophotovoltaic platforms. Sixteen algal strains, comprising local isolates and two diatoms obtained from the Culture Collection of Marine Phytoplankton (CCMP), USA, were screened and eight were selected based on the growth rate, biochemical composition and photosynthesis performance using suspension cultures. Differences in biofilm formation between the eight algal strains as well as their rapid light curve (RLC) generated using a pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorometer, were examined. The RLC provides detailed information on the saturation characteristics of electron transport and overall photosynthetic performance of the algae. Four algal strains, belonging to the Cyanophyta (Cyanobacteria) Synechococcus elongatus (UMACC 105), Spirulina platensis. (UMACC 159) and the Chlorophyta Chlorella vulgaris (UMACC 051), and Chlorella sp. (UMACC 313) were finally selected for investigation using biophotovoltaic platforms. Based on power output per Chl-a content, the algae can be ranked as follows: Synechococcus elongatus (UMACC 105) (6.38×10(-5) Wm(-2)/µgChl-a)>Chlorella vulgaris UMACC 051 (2.24×10(-5) Wm(-2)/µgChl-a)>Chlorella sp.(UMACC 313) (1.43×10(-5) Wm(-2)/µgChl-a)>Spirulina platensis (UMACC 159) (4.90×10(-6) Wm(-2)/µgChl-a).

Within this context, Rab5a plays an important role in the spatial regulation of intracellular transport and signal transduction processes. Here, we report a previously uncharacterized role for Rab5a in the regulation of T-cell motility. We show that Rab5a physically associates with protein kinase Cϵ (PKCϵ) in migrating T-cells. After stimulation of T-cells through the integrin LFA-1 or the chemokine receptor CXCR4, Rab5a is phosphorylated on an N-terminal Thr-7 site by PKCϵ. Both Rab5a and PKCϵ dynamically interact at the centrosomal region of migrating cells, and PKCϵ-mediated phosphorylation on Thr-7 regulates Rab5a trafficking to the cell leading edge. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Rab5a Thr-7 phosphorylation is functionally necessary for Rac1 activation, actin rearrangement, and T-cell motility. We present a novel mechanism by which a PKCϵ-Rab5a-Rac1 axis regulates cytoskeleton remodeling and T-cell migration, both of which are central for the adaptive immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2070735350,"The family Poritidae formerly included 6 genera: Alveopora, Goniopora, Machadoporites, Porites, Poritipora, and Stylaraea. Morphologically, the genera can be differentiated based on the number of tentacles, the number of septa and their arrangement, the length of the polyp column, and the diameter of the corallites. However, the phylogenetic relationships within and between the genera are unknown or contentious. On the one hand, Alveopora has been transferred to the Acroporidae recently because it was shown to be more closely related to this family than to the Poritidae by previous molecular studies. On the other hand, Goniopora is morphologically similar to 2 recently described genera, Machadoporites and Poritipora, particularly with regard to the number of septa (approximately 24), but they have not yet been investigated at the molecular level. In this study, we analyzed 93 samples from all 5 poritid genera and Alveopora using 2 genetic markers (the barcoding region of the mitochondrial COI and the ITS region of the nuclear rDNA) to investigate their phylogenetic relationships and to revise their taxonomy. The reconstructed molecular trees confirmed that Alveopora is genetically distant from all poritid genera but closely related to the family Acroporidae, whereas the other genera are genetically closely related. The molecular trees also revealed that Machadoporites and Poritipora were indistinguishable from Goniopora. However, Goniopora stutchburyi was genetically isolated from the other congeneric species and formed a sister group to Goniopora together with Porites and Stylaraea, thus suggesting that 24 septa could be an ancestral feature in the Poritidae. Based on these data, we move G. stutchburyi into a new genus, Bernardpora gen. nov., whereas Machadoporites and Poritipora are merged with Goniopora."

FISH revealed two main patterns: (i) exclusively scattered signals, and (ii) scattered and specific signals, forming evident blocks. The enrichment was observed in both euchromatic and heterochromatic areas and only the motif (C)30 was absent in heterochromatin. The A and B chromosomes were enriched with all the elements that were mapped, being observed in the B chromosome more distinctive blocks for (GA)15 and (GAG)10. For A complement distinctive blocks were noticed for (A)30, (CA)15, (CG)15, (GA)15, (CAC)10, (CAA)10, (CGG)10, (GAA)10, (GAC)10 and (GATA)8. These results revealed an intense spreading of microsatellites in the A. flavolineata genome that was independent of the A+T or G+C enrichment in the repeats. The data indicate that the microsatellites compose the B chromosome and could be involved in the evolution of this element in this species, although no specific relationship with any A chromosome was observed to discuss about its origin. The systematic analysis presented here contributes to the knowledge of repetitive DNA chromosomal organization among grasshoppers including the B chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2024414230,"Counting animals to estimate their population sizes is often essential for their management and conservation. Since practitioners frequently rely on indirect observations of animals, it is important to better understand the relationship between such indirect indices and animal abundance. The Formozov-Malyshev-Pereleshin (FMP) formula provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the relationship between animal track counts and the true density of species. Although this analytical method potentially has universal applicability wherever animals are readily detectable by their tracks, it has long been unique to Russia and remains widely underappreciated. In this paper, we provide a test of the FMP formula by isolating the influence of animal travel path tortuosity (i.e., convolutedness) on track counts. We employed simulations using virtual and empirical data, in addition to a field test comparing FMP estimates with independent estimates from line transect distance sampling. We verify that track counts (total intersections between animals and transects) are determined entirely by density and daily movement distances. Hence, the FMP estimator is theoretically robust against potential biases from specific shapes or patterns of animal movement paths if transects are randomly situated with respect to those movements (i.e., the transects do not influence animals’ movements). However, detectability (the detection probability of individual animals) is not determined simply by daily travel distance but also by tortuosity, so ensuring that all intersections with transects are counted regardless of the number of individual animals that made them becomes critical for an accurate density estimate. Additionally, although tortuosity has no bearing on mean track encounter rates, it does affect encounter rate variance and therefore estimate precision. We discuss how these fundamental principles made explicit by the FMP formula have widespread implications for methods of assessing animal abundance that rely on indirect observations."
https://openalex.org/W1969556651,"Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum, first-in-class glycylcycline antibiotic currently used to treat complicated skin and intra-abdominal infections, as well as community-acquired pneumonia. In addition, we have demonstrated that tigecycline also has in vitro and in vivo activity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) due to its ability to inhibit mitochondrial translation. Tigecycline is relatively unstable after reconstitution, and this instability may limit the use of the drug in ambulatory infusions for the treatment of infection and may prevent the development of optimal dosing schedules for the treatment of AML. This study sought to identify a formulation that improved the stability of the drug after reconstitution and maintained its antimicrobial and antileukemic activity. A panel of chemical additives was tested to identify excipients that enhanced the stability of tigecycline in solution at room temperature for up to one week. We identified a novel formulation containing the oxygen-reducing agents ascorbic acid (3 mg/mL) and pyruvate (60 mg/mL), in saline solution, pH 7.0, in which tigecycline (1 mg/mL) remained intact when protected from light for at least 7 days. This formulation also preserved the drug's antibacterial and antileukemic activity in vitro. Moreover, the novel formulation retained tigecycline's antileukemic activity in vivo. Thus, we identified and characterized a novel formulation for tigecycline that preserves its stability and efficacy after reconstitution."
https://openalex.org/W1998164127,In utero RNAi of the dyslexia-associated gene Kiaa0319 in rats (KIA-) degrades cortical responses to speech sounds and increases trial-by-trial variability in onset latency. We tested the hypothesis that KIA- rats would be impaired at speech sound discrimination. KIA- rats needed twice as much training in quiet conditions to perform at control levels and remained impaired at several speech tasks. Focused training using truncated speech sounds was able to normalize speech discrimination in quiet and background noise conditions. Training also normalized trial-by-trial neural variability and temporal phase locking. Cortical activity from speech trained KIA- rats was sufficient to accurately discriminate between similar consonant sounds. These results provide the first direct evidence that assumed reduced expression of the dyslexia-associated gene KIAA0319 can cause phoneme processing impairments similar to those seen in dyslexia and that intensive behavioral therapy can eliminate these impairments.

The GxGD aspartyl proteases SPPL2a and, to a lesser extent, SPPL2b are responsible for this intramembrane cleavage event. Additionally, the TMEM106B paralog TMEM106A is also lysosomally localized; however, it is not a specific substrate of SPPL2a or SPPL2b. Our data add to the growing list of proteins that undergo intramembrane proteolysis and may shed light on the regulation of the frontotemporal lobar degeneration risk factor TMEM106B."
https://openalex.org/W2066704947,"Cdk5 is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) family. In contrast to other Cdks that promote cell proliferation, Cdk5 plays a role in regulating various neuronal functions, including neuronal migration, synaptic activity, and neuron death. Cdks responsible for cell proliferation need phosphorylation in the activation loop for activation in addition to binding a regulatory subunit cyclin. Cdk5, however, is activated only by binding to its activator, p35 or p39. Furthermore, in contrast to Cdk1 and Cdk2, which are inhibited by phosphorylation at Tyr-15, the kinase activity of Cdk5 is reported to be stimulated when phosphorylated at Tyr-15 by Src family kinases or receptor-type tyrosine kinases. We investigated the activation mechanism of Cdk5 by phosphorylation at Tyr-15. Unexpectedly, however, it was found that Tyr-15 phosphorylation occurred only on monomeric Cdk5, and the coexpression of activators, p35/p25, p39, or Cyclin I, inhibited the phosphorylation. In neuron cultures, too, the activation of Fyn tyrosine kinase did not increase Tyr-15 phosphorylation of Cdk5. Further, phospho-Cdk5 at Tyr-15 was not detected in the p35-bound Cdk5. In contrast, expression of active Fyn increased p35 in neurons. These results indicate that phosphorylation at Tyr-15 is not an activation mechanism of Cdk5 but, rather, indicate that tyrosine kinases could activate Cdk5 by increasing the protein amount of p35. These results call for reinvestigation of how Cdk5 is regulated downstream of Src family kinases or receptor tyrosine kinases in neurons, which is an important signaling cascade in a variety of neuronal activities."

https://openalex.org/W1976914598,"Epidermal and mucosal epithelial cells are integral to host defense. They not only act as a physical barrier but also utilize pattern recognition receptors, such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), to detect and respond to pathogens. Members of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of transcription factors are key components of TLR signaling as they impart specificity to downstream responses. Although IRF6 is a critical regulator of epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation, its role in TLR signaling has not previously been addressed. We show here that IRF6 is activated by IRAK1 as well as by MyD88 but not by TRIF or TBK1. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments further demonstrated that IRF6 can interact with IRAK1. Gene silencing in epithelial cells along with gene promoter reporter assays showed that IRAK1 mediates TLR2-inducible CCL5 gene expression at least in part by promoting IRF6 activation. Conversely, IRAK1 regulated CXCL8 gene expression independently of IRF6, thus identifying a molecular mechanism by which TLR2 signaling differentially regulates the expression of specific chemokines in epithelial cells. Bioinformatics analysis and mutagenesis-based experiments identified Ser-413 and Ser-424 as key regulatory sites in IRF6. Phosphomimetic mutation of these residues resulted in greatly enhanced IRF6 dimerization and trans-activator function. Collectively, our findings suggest that, in addition to its importance for epithelial barrier function, IRF6 also contributes to host defense by providing specificity to the regulation of inflammatory chemokine expression by TLR2 in epithelial cells."

https://openalex.org/W2052426890,"Circadian (≅ 24 h) clocks control daily rhythms in metabolism, physiology, and behavior in animals, plants, and microbes. In Drosophila, these clocks keep circadian time via transcriptional feedback loops in which clock-cycle (CLK-CYC) initiates transcription of period (per) and timeless (tim), accumulating levels of PER and TIM proteins feed back to inhibit CLK-CYC, and degradation of PER and TIM allows CLK-CYC to initiate the next cycle of transcription. The timing of key events in this feedback loop are controlled by, or coincide with, rhythms in PER and CLK phosphorylation, where PER and CLK phosphorylation is high during transcriptional repression. PER phosphorylation at specific sites controls its subcellular localization, activity, and stability, but comparatively little is known about the identity and function of CLK phosphorylation sites. Here we identify eight CLK phosphorylation sites via mass spectrometry and determine how phosphorylation at these sites impacts behavioral and molecular rhythms by transgenic rescue of a new Clk null mutant. Eliminating phosphorylation at four of these sites accelerates the feedback loop to shorten the circadian period, whereas loss of CLK phosphorylation at serine 859 increases CLK activity, thereby increasing PER levels and accelerating transcriptional repression. These results demonstrate that CLK phosphorylation influences the circadian period by regulating CLK activity and progression through the feedback loop."
https://openalex.org/W2078983976,"Neural stem or progenitor cells have been proposed to restore gastrointestinal function in patients suffering from congenital or acquired defects of the enteric nervous system. Various, mainly embryonic cell sources have been identified for this purpose. However, immunological and ethical issues make a postnatal cell based therapy desirable. We therefore evaluated and quantified the potential of progenitor cells of the postnatal murine enteric nervous system to give rise to neurons and glial cells in vitro. Electrophysiological analysis and BrdU uptake studies provided direct evidence that generated neurons derive from expanded cells in vitro. Transplantation of isolated and expanded postnatal progenitor cells into the distal colon of adult mice demonstrated cell survival for 12 weeks (end of study). Implanted cells migrated within the gut wall and differentiated into neurons and glial cells, both of which were shown to derive from proliferated cells by BrdU uptake. This study indicates that progenitor cells isolated from the postnatal enteric nervous system might have the potential to serve as a source for a cell based therapy for neurogastrointestinal motility disorders. However, further studies are necessary to provide evidence that the generated cells are capable to positively influence the motility of the diseased gastrointestinal tract."
https://openalex.org/W2033953853,"Based on a reduced two-compartment model, the dynamical and biophysical mechanism underlying the spike initiation of the neuron to extracellular electric fields is investigated in this paper. With stability and phase plane analysis, we first investigate in detail the dynamical properties of neuronal spike initiation induced by geometric parameter and internal coupling conductance. The geometric parameter is the ratio between soma area and total membrane area, which describes the proportion of area occupied by somatic chamber. It is found that varying it could qualitatively alter the bifurcation structures of equilibrium as well as neuronal phase portraits, which remain unchanged when varying internal coupling conductance. By analyzing the activating properties of somatic membrane currents at subthreshold potentials, we explore the relevant biophysical basis of spike initiation dynamics induced by these two parameters. It is observed that increasing geometric parameter could greatly decrease the intensity of the internal current flowing from soma to dendrite, which switches spike initiation dynamics from Hopf bifurcation to SNIC bifurcation; increasing internal coupling conductance could lead to the increase of this outward internal current, whereas the increasing range is so small that it could not qualitatively alter the spike initiation dynamics. These results highlight that neuronal geometric parameter is a crucial factor in determining the spike initiation dynamics to electric fields. The finding is useful to interpret the functional significance of neuronal biophysical properties in their encoding dynamics, which could contribute to uncovering how neuron encodes electric field signals."

NKG2D ligands can be induced upon cell stress and are frequently targeted post-translationally in infected or transformed cells to avoid immune recognition. Virus infection and inflammation alter protein N-glycosylation, and we have previously shown that changes in cellular N-glycosylation are involved in regulation of NKG2D ligand surface expression. The specific mode of regulation through N-glycosylation is, however, unknown. Here we investigated whether direct N-glycosylation of the NKG2D ligand MICA itself is critical for cell surface expression and sought to identify the essential residues. We found that a single N-glycosylation site (Asn8) was important for MICA018 surface expression. The frequently expressed MICA allele 008, with an altered transmembrane and intracellular domain, was not affected by mutation of this N-glycosylation site. Mutational analysis revealed that a single amino acid (Thr24) in the extracellular domain of MICA018 was essential for the N-glycosylation dependence, whereas the intracellular domain was not involved. The HHV7 immunoevasin, U21, was found to inhibit MICA018 surface expression by affecting N-glycosylation, and the retention was rescued by T24A substitution. Our study reveals N-glycosylation as an allele-specific regulatory mechanism important for regulation of surface expression of MICA018, and we pinpoint the residues essential for this N-glycosylation dependence.

At present, 76 different alleles of MICA have been identified, the majority being highly homologous. The 008 allele of MICA is unusual because it encodes a molecule lacking a cytoplasmic tail caused by a frameshift mutation that leads to a premature stop codon (15Robinson J. Pérez-Rodríguez M.

Some viruses can inhibit full-length MICA alleles, but not the truncated MICA008.

However, many proteins that are normally glycosylated show no loss of function when glycosylation is prevented (37Benjamin L. Cassimeris L. Lingappa V. Plopper G. Cells. Jones and Bartlett Publishers, Sudbury, MA2007: 120Google Scholar). N-Glycosylation is initiated by a cotranslational process in the lumen of ER. The N-glycans are added to consensus sequences Asn-Xaa-(Thr/Ser) and further trimmed and remodeled upon transit through the Golgi. Cancer and infection often result in altered glycosylation of cellular proteins (38Marcos N.T. Magalhães A. Ferreira B. Oliveira M.J. Carvalho A.S. Mendes N. Gilmartin T. Head S.R. Figueiredo C.

Although the purposes may be numerous, it is likely that the changes in N-glycosylation participate in escape of immune recognition. Based on our previous studies, which showed that 2-deoxy d-Glucose (2DG) inhibited MIC surface expression by blocking cellular N-glycosylation, the aim of this project was to investigate the importance of the molecular N-glycan pattern of MICA itself for cell surface expression of MICA. Furthermore, we sought to identify residues in MICA important for this N-glycosylation-mediated regulation. We show that N-glycosylation is an allele-specific post-translational mechanism directly regulating MICA018 surface expression. We found that abrogation of N-glycosylation at position Asn8 inhibited cell surface expression of MICA018. This regulatory mechanism did not apply to MICA008 surface expression, which was unaffected by changes in N-glycosylation. Mutational analysis focusing on the differences between MICA018 and MICA008 alleles showed that a single amino acid (Thr24) in the extracellular domain of MICA018 was essential for N-glycosylation dependence, whereas the cytoplasmic tail was not involved. These regulatory properties of MICA018 sensitivity to N-glycosylation were found to be targeted by cells expressing HHV7-U21. Furthermore, MICA008 surface expression was also inhibited in HHV7-U21-expressing cells, possibly through a novel post-translational regulatory mechanism.

Transient transfections of all cell lines were done using the Amaxa Nucleofector Device (Lonza) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Short descriptions for each cell line follow. For Jurkat cells, 3 × 106 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of cell line Nucleofector solution V or Ingenio electroporation solution (MIR 50117; Mirus Bio LLC), mixed with 1 μg or 3 μg of plasmid, and pulsed using the Nucleofector program G-010. For Granta-519 cells, 2 × 106 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of Ingenio electroporation solution, mixed with 5 μg of plasmid, and pulsed using the Nucleofector program T-001. The expression of the plasmids was measured 20–24 h after transfection. For melanoma cell lines, 1.5–2 × 106 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of Nucleofector solution T, mixed with 1.5–2 μg of plasmid, and pulsed using the Nucleofector program U-020.

https://openalex.org/W2088863626,"Background Colitis is a common clinical complication in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a primary immunodeficiency caused by impaired oxidative burst. Existing experimental data from NADPH-oxidase knockout mice propose contradictory roles for the involvement of reactive oxygen species in colitis chronicity and severity. Since genetically controlled mice with a point-mutation in the Ncf1 gene are susceptible to chronic inflammation and autoimmunity, we tested whether they presented increased predisposition to develop chronic colitis. Methods Colitis was induced in Ncf1-mutant and wild-type mice by a 1st 7-days cycle of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), intercalated by a 7-days resting period followed by a 2nd 7-days DSS-cycle. Cytokines were quantified locally in the colon inflammatory infiltrates and in the serum. Leukocyte infiltration and morphological alterations of the colon mucosa were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results Clinical scores demonstrated a more severe colitis in Ncf1-mutant mice than controls, with no recovery during the resting period and a severe chronic colitis after the 2nd cycle, confirmed by histopathology and presence of infiltrating neutrophils, macrophages, plasmocytes and lymphocytes in the colon. Severe colitis was mediated by increased local expression of cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-17A) and phosphorylation of Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). Serological cytokine titers of those inflammatory cytokines were more elevated in Ncf1-mutant than control mice, and were accompanied by systemic changes in functional subsets of monocytes, CD4+T and B cells. Conclusion This suggests that an ineffective oxidative burst leads to severe chronic colitis through local accumulation of peroxynitrites, pro-inflammatory cytokines and lymphocytes and systemic immune deregulation similar to CGD."
https://openalex.org/W2090140794,"Background Emergency Departments (EDs) have to cope with an increasing number of elderly patients, often presenting with non-specific complaints (NSC), such as generalized weakness. Acute morbidity requiring early intervention is present in the majority of patients with NSC. Therefore, an early and optimal disposition plan is crucial. The objective of this study was to prospectively study the disposition process of patients presenting to the ED with NSC. Methods For two years, all patients presenting with NSC presenting to an urban ED were screened and consecutively included. The initial disposition plan was compared to the effective transfer after observation. Optimal disposition was defined as a high accuracy regarding disposition of patients with acute morbidity to an internal medicine ward. Results The final study population consisted of 669 patients with NSC. Admission to internal medicine increased from 297 (44%) planned admissions to 388 (58%) effective admissions after observation. Conversely, transfers to geriatric community hospitals and discharges decreased from the initially planned 372 (56%) patients to 281 (42%) effectively transferred and discharged patients. The accuracy regarding disposition of patients with acute morbidity increased from 53% to 68% after observation. Conclusion Disposition planning in patients with NSC improves after observation, if defined by the accuracy regarding hospitalization of patients with acute morbidity. Further research should focus on risk stratification tools for timely disposition planning in order to reduce high admission rates for patients without acute morbidity and high readmission rates for discharged patients with non-specific complaints."
https://openalex.org/W1986854303,"Two lines of investigation have highlighted the importance of antibodies to the V1/V2 domain of gp120 in providing protection from HIV-1 infection. First, the recent RV144 HIV-1 vaccine trial documented a correlation between non-neutralizing antibodies to the V2 domain and protection. Second, multiple broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the V1/V2 domain (e.g. PG9) have been isolated from rare infected individuals, termed elite neutralizers. Interestingly, the binding of both types of antibodies appears to depend on the same cluster of amino acids (positions 167–171) adjacent to the junction of the B and C strands of the four-stranded V1/V2 domain β-sheet structure. However, the broadly neutralizing mAb, PG9, additionally depends on mannose-5 glycans at positions 156 and 160 for binding. Because the gp120 vaccine immunogens used in previous HIV-1 vaccine trials were enriched for complex sialic acid-containing glycans, and lacked the high mannose structures required for the binding of PG9-like mAbs, we wondered if these immunogens could be improved by limiting glycosylation to mannose-5 glycans. Here, we describe the PG9 binding activity of monomeric gp120s from multiple strains of HIV-1 produced with mannose-5 glycans. We also describe the properties of glycopeptide scaffolds from the V1/V2 domain also expressed with mannose-5 glycans. The V1/V2 scaffold from the A244 isolate was able to bind the PG9, CH01, and CH03 mAbs with high affinity provided that the proper glycans were present. We further show that immunization with A244 V1/V2 fragments alone, or in a prime/boost regimen with gp120, enhanced the antibody response to sequences in the V1/V2 domain associated with protection in the RV144 trial."
https://openalex.org/W2125290101,"Mediator is an evolutionary conserved multi-protein complex present in all eukaryotes. It functions as a transcriptional co-regulator by conveying signals from activators and repressors to the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. The Arabidopsis thaliana Med25 (aMed25) ACtivation Interaction Domain (ACID) interacts with the Dreb2a activator which is involved in plant stress response pathways, while Human Med25-ACID (hMed25) interacts with the herpes simplex virus VP16 activator. Despite low sequence similarity, hMed25-ACID also interacts with the plant-specific Dreb2a transcriptional activator protein. We have used GST pull-down-, surface plasmon resonance-, isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR chemical shift experiments to characterize interactions between Dreb2a and VP16, with the hMed25 and aMed25-ACIDs. We found that VP16 interacts with aMed25-ACID with similar affinity as with hMed25-ACID and that the binding surface on aMed25-ACID overlaps with the binding site for Dreb2a. We also show that the Dreb2a interaction region in hMed25-ACID overlaps with the earlier reported VP16 binding site. In addition, we show that hMed25-ACID/Dreb2a and aMed25-ACID/Dreb2a display similar binding affinities but different binding energetics. Our results therefore indicate that interaction between transcriptional regulators and their target proteins in Mediator are less dependent on the primary sequences in the interaction domains but that these domains fold into similar structures upon interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2075406940,"Background Hulless barley is attracting increasing attention due to its unique nutritional value and potential health benefits. However, the molecular biology of the barley grain development and nutrient storage are not well understood. Furthermore, the genetic potential of hulless barley has not been fully tapped for breeding. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, we investigated the transcriptome features during hulless barley grain development. Using Illumina paired-end RNA-Sequencing, we generated two data sets of the developing grain transcriptomes from two hulless barley landraces. A total of 13.1 and 12.9 million paired-end reads with lengths of 90 bp were generated from the two varieties and were assembled to 48,863 and 45,788 unigenes, respectively. A combined dataset of 46,485 All-Unigenes were generated from two transcriptomes with an average length of 542 bp, and 36,278 among were annotated with gene descriptions, conserved protein domains or gene ontology terms. Furthermore, sequences and expression levels of genes related to the biosynthesis of storage reserve compounds (starch, protein, and β-glucan) were analyzed, and their temporal and spatial patterns were deduced from the transcriptome data of cultivated barley Morex. Conclusions/Significance We established a sequences and functional annotation integrated database and examined the expression profiles of the developing grains of Tibetan hulless barley. The characterization of genes encoding storage proteins and enzymes of starch synthesis and (1–3;1–4)-β-D-glucan synthesis provided an overview of changes in gene expression associated with grain nutrition and health properties. Furthermore, the characterization of these genes provides a gene reservoir, which helps in quality improvement of hulless barley."
https://openalex.org/W2090259361,"REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ are members of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily of ligand-regulated transcription factors that play important roles in the regulation of circadian physiology, metabolism, and immune function. Although the REV-ERBs were originally characterized as orphan receptors, recent studies have demonstrated that they function as receptors for heme. Here, we demonstrate that cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPP) and zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP) are ligands that bind directly to the REV-ERBs. However, instead of mimicking the agonist action of heme, CoPP and ZnPP function as antagonists of REV-ERB function. This was unexpected because the only distinction between these ligands is the metal ion that is coordinated. To understand the structural basis by which REV-ERBβ can differentiate between a porphyrin agonist and antagonist, we characterized the interaction between REV-ERBβ with heme, CoPP, and ZnPP using biochemical and structural approaches, including x-ray crystallography and NMR. The crystal structure of CoPP-bound REV-ERBβ indicates only minor conformational changes induced by CoPP compared with heme, including the porphyrin ring of CoPP, which adopts a planar conformation as opposed to the puckered conformation observed in the heme-bound REV-ERBβ crystal structure. Thus, subtle changes in the porphyrin metal center and ring conformation may influence the agonist versus antagonist action of porphyrins and when considered with other studies suggest that gas binding to the iron metal center heme may drive alterations in REV-ERB activity."
https://openalex.org/W2059791793,"Ecohydrodynamics investigates the hydrodynamic constraints on ecosystems across different temporal and spatial scales. Ecohydrodynamics play a pivotal role in the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems, however the lack of integrated complex flow models for deep-water ecosystems beyond the coastal zone prevents further synthesis in these settings. We present a hydrodynamic model for one of Earth's most biologically diverse deep-water ecosystems, cold-water coral reefs. The Mingulay Reef Complex (western Scotland) is an inshore seascape of cold-water coral reefs formed by the scleractinian coral Lophelia pertusa. We applied single-image edge detection and composite front maps using satellite remote sensing, to detect oceanographic fronts and peaks of chlorophyll a values that likely affect food supply to corals and other suspension-feeding fauna. We also present a high resolution 3D ocean model to incorporate salient aspects of the regional and local oceanography. Model validation using in situ current speed, direction and sea elevation data confirmed the model's realistic representation of spatial and temporal aspects of circulation at the reef complex including a tidally driven current regime, eddies, and downwelling phenomena. This novel combination of 3D hydrodynamic modelling and remote sensing in deep-water ecosystems improves our understanding of the temporal and spatial scales of ecological processes occurring in marine systems. The modelled information has been integrated into a 3D GIS, providing a user interface for visualization and interrogation of results that allows wider ecological application of the model and that can provide valuable input for marine biodiversity and conservation applications."
https://openalex.org/W2165985623,"The effect that climate change and variability will have on waterborne bacteria is a topic of increasing concern for coastal ecosystems, including the Chesapeake Bay. Surface water temperature trends in the Bay indicate a warming pattern of roughly 0.3–0.4°C per decade over the past 30 years. It is unclear what impact future warming will have on pathogens currently found in the Bay, including Vibrio spp. Using historical environmental data, combined with three different statistical models of Vibrio vulnificus probability, we explore the relationship between environmental change and predicted Vibrio vulnificus presence in the upper Chesapeake Bay. We find that the predicted response of V. vulnificus probability to high temperatures in the Bay differs systematically between models of differing structure. As existing publicly available datasets are inadequate to determine which model structure is most appropriate, the impact of climatic change on the probability of V. vulnificus presence in the Chesapeake Bay remains uncertain. This result points to the challenge of characterizing climate sensitivity of ecological systems in which data are sparse and only statistical models of ecological sensitivity exist."
https://openalex.org/W1966503198,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) promotes the survival, maintenance, and neurite outgrowth of sensory and sympathetic neurons, and the effects are mediated by TrkA receptor signaling. Thus, the cell surface location of the TrkA receptor is crucial for NGF-mediated functions. However, the regulatory mechanism underlying TrkA cell surface levels remains incompletely understood. In this study, we identified syntaxin 8 (STX8), a Q-SNARE protein, as a novel TrkA-binding protein. Overexpression and knockdown studies showed that STX8 facilitates TrkA transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane and regulates the surface levels of TrkA but not TrkB receptors. Furthermore, STX8 modulates downstream NGF-induced TrkA signaling and, consequently, the survival of NGF-dependent dorsal root ganglia neurons. Finally, knockdown of STX8 in rat dorsal root ganglia by recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 6-mediated RNA interference led to analgesic effects on formalin-induced inflammatory pain. These findings demonstrate that STX8 is a modulator of TrkA cell surface levels and biological functions."
https://openalex.org/W2059119572,"Background The impact of the intrauterine environment on the developmental programming of adult female reproductive success is still poorly understood and potentially underestimated. Litter size variation in a nonhuman primate, the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus), allows us to model the effects of varying intrauterine environments (e.g. nutrient restriction, exposure to male womb-mates) on the risk of losing fetuses in adulthood. Our previous work has characterized the fetuses of triplet pregnancies as experiencing intrauterine nutritional restriction. Methodology/Principal Findings We used over a decade of demographic data from the Southwest National Primate Research Center common marmoset colony. We evaluated differences between twin and triplet females in the number of pregnancies they produce and the proportion of those pregnancies that ended in fetal loss. We found that triplet females produced the same number of total offspring as twin females, but lost offspring during pregnancy at a significantly higher rate than did twins (38% vs. 13%, p = 0.02). Regardless of their own birth weight or the sex ratio of the litter the experienced as fetuses, triplet females lost more fetuses than did twins. Females with a male littermate experienced a significant increase in the proportion of stillbirths. Conclusions/Significance These striking findings anchor pregnancy loss in the mother’s own fetal environment and development, underscoring a ""Womb to Womb"" view of the lifecourse and the intergenerational consequences of development. This has important translational implications for understanding the large proportion of human stillbirths that are unexplained. Our findings provide strong evidence that a full understanding of mammalian life history and reproductive biology requires a developmental foundation."
https://openalex.org/W1995473167,"The two-partner secretion (TPS) systems of Gram-negative bacteria secrete large TpsA exoproteins by a dedicated TpsB transporter in the outer membrane. TpsBs contain an N-terminal module located in the periplasm that includes two polypeptide transport-associated (POTRA) domains. These are thought to initiate secretion of a TpsA by binding its N-terminal secretion signal, called the TPS domain. Neisseria meningitidis encodes up to five TpsA proteins that are secreted via only two TpsB transporters: TpsB1 and TpsB2. Of these two, the TpsB2 recognizes the TPS domains of all TpsAs, despite their sequence diversity. By contrast, the TpsB1 shows a limited recognition of a TPS domain that is shared by two TpsAs. The difference in substrate specificity of the TpsBs enabled us to investigate the role of the POTRA domains in the selection of TPS domains. We tested secretion of TPS domains or full-length TpsAs by TpsB mutants with deleted, duplicated, and exchanged POTRA domains. Exchanging the two POTRA domains of a TpsB resulted in a switch in specificity. Furthermore, exchanging a single POTRA domain showed that each of the two domains contributed to the cargo selection. Remarkably, the order of the POTRA domains could be reversed without affecting substrate selection, but this aberrant order did result in an alternatively processed secretion product. Our results suggest that secretion of a TpsA is initiated by engaging both POTRA domains of a TpsB transporter and that these select the cognate TpsAs for secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2075471471,"We analyzed angling catch records for 341,959 muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) from North America to test for a cyclic lunar influence on the catch. Using periodic regression, we showed that the number caught was strongly related to the 29-day lunar cycle, and the effect was consistent across most fisheries. More muskellunge were caught around the full and new moon than at other times. At night, more muskellunge were caught around the full moon than the new moon. The predicted maximum relative effect was ≈5% overall. Anglers fishing exclusively on the peak lunar day would, on average, catch 5% more muskellunge than anglers fishing on random days. On some lakes and at night, the maximum relative effect was higher. We obtained angler effort data for Wisconsin, Mille Lacs (MN), and Lake Vermilion (MN). For Lake Vermilion there was a significant effect of the lunar cycle on angler effort. We could therefore not conclude that the lunar effect on catch was due to an effect on fish behavior alone. Several factors affected the amount of variation explained by the lunar cycle. The lunar effect was stronger for larger muskellunge (>102 cm) than for smaller fish, stronger in midsummer than in June or October, and stronger for fish caught at high latitudes (>48°N) than for fish caught further south. There was no difference in the lunar effect between expert and novice muskellunge anglers. We argue that this variation is evidence that the effect of the lunar cycle on catch is mediated by biological factors and is not due solely to angler effort and reflects lunar synchronization in feeding. This effect has been attributed to variation among moon phases in lunar illumination, but our results do not support that hypothesis for angler-caught muskellunge."
https://openalex.org/W2091767719,"High mobility group nucleosomal binding domain 2 (HMGN2) is a small and unique non-histone protein that has many functions in a variety of cellular processes, including regulation of chromatin structure, transcription, and DNA repair. In addition, it may have other roles in antimicrobial activity, cell homing, and regulating cytokine release. Although the biochemical properties of HMGN2 protein are regulated by acetylation and phosphorylation, it is not yet known whether HMGN2 activity can also be regulated by SUMOylation. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that HMGN2 is modified by covalent attachment of small ubiquitin-related modifier 1 (SUMO1) by pro-inflammatory signal and identified the major SUMOylated lysine residues that localize to the HMGN2 nucleosome-binding domain at Lys-17 and Lys-35. SENP1 can deSUMOylate SUMOylated HMGN2, and PIAS1 is the E3 ligase responsible for SUMOylation of HMGN2. Finally, using SUMO1-conjugated HMGN2 purified from a basal SUMOylation system in Escherichia coli, we demonstrated that SUMOylated HMGN2 has decreased the binding affinity to nucleosome core particles in comparison to unSUMOylated HMGN2. These observations potentially provide new perspectives for understanding the functions of HMGN2 in inflammatory reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1974186548,"A proteomics-based search for molecules interacting with caspase-14 identified prosaposin and epidermal mesotrypsin as candidates. Prosaposin is a precursor of four sphingolipid activator proteins (saposins A–D) that are essential for lysosomal hydrolysis of sphingolipids. Thus, we hypothesized that caspase-14 and mesotrypsin participate in processing of prosaposin. Because we identified a saposin A sequence as an interactor with these proteases, we prepared a specific antibody to saposin A and focused on saposin A-related physiological reactions. We found that mesotrypsin generated saposins A–D from prosaposin, and mature caspase-14 contributed to this process by activating mesotrypsinogen to mesotrypsin. Knockdown of these proteases markedly down-regulated saposin A synthesis in skin equivalent models. Saposin A was localized in granular cells, whereas prosaposin was present in the upper layer of human epidermis. The proximity ligation assay confirmed interaction between prosaposin, caspase-14, and mesotrypsin in the granular layer. Oil Red staining showed that the lipid envelope was significantly reduced in the cornified layer of skin from saposin A-deficient mice. Ultrastructural studies revealed severely disorganized cornified layer structure in both prosaposin- and saposin A-deficient mice. Overall, our results indicate that epidermal mesotrypsin and caspase-14 work cooperatively in prosaposin processing. We propose that they thereby contribute to permeability barrier formation in vivo.

Because we identified a saposin A sequence as an interactor with these proteases, we prepared a specific antibody to saposin A and focused on saposin A-related physiological reactions. We found that mesotrypsin generated saposins A–D from prosaposin, and mature caspase-14 contributed to this process by activating mesotrypsinogen to mesotrypsin. Knockdown of these proteases markedly down-regulated saposin A synthesis in skin equivalent models. Saposin A was localized in granular cells, whereas prosaposin was present in the upper layer of human epidermis. The proximity ligation assay confirmed interaction between prosaposin, caspase-14, and mesotrypsin in the granular layer. Oil Red staining showed that the lipid envelope was significantly reduced in the cornified layer of skin from saposin A-deficient mice. Ultrastructural studies revealed severely disorganized cornified layer structure in both prosaposin- and saposin A-deficient mice. Overall, our results indicate that epidermal mesotrypsin and caspase-14 work cooperatively in prosaposin processing. We propose that they thereby contribute to permeability barrier formation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2059362068,"The classic understanding of prehension is that of coordinated reaching and grasping. An alternative view is that the grasping in prehension emerges from independently controlled individual digit movements (the double-pointing model). The current study tested this latter model in bimanual prehension: participants had to grasp an object between their two index fingers. Right after the start of the movement, the future end position of one of the digits was perturbed. The perturbations resulted in expected changes in the kinematics of the perturbed digit but also in adjusted kinematics in the unperturbed digit. The latter effects showed up when the end position of the right index finger was perturbed, but not when the end position of the left index finger was perturbed. Because the absence of a coupling between the digits is the core assumption of the double-pointing model, finding any perturbation effects challenges this account of prehension; the double-pointing model predicts that the unperturbed digit would be unaffected by the perturbation. The authors conclude that the movement of the digits in prehension is coupled into a grasping component."

Concerted integration catalyzed by RSV integrase (IN) is effectively inhibited by HIV STIs. Optimized assembly of the RSV synaptic complex required IN, a gain-of-function 3′-OH-recessed U3 oligonucleotide, and an STI under specific conditions to maintain solubility of the trapped synaptic complex at 4 °C. A C-terminal truncated IN (1–269 residues) produced a homogeneous population of trapped synaptic complex that eluted at ∼151,000 Da upon Superdex 200 size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Approximately 90% of input IN and DNA are incorporated into the trapped synaptic complex using either the C-terminally truncated IN or wild type IN (1–286 residues). No STI is present in the SEC running buffer suggesting the STI-trapped synaptic complex is kinetically stabilized. The yield of the trapped synaptic complex correlates with the dissociative half-life of the STI observed with HIV IN-DNA complexes. Dolutegravir, MK-2048, and MK-0536 are equally effective, whereas raltegravir is ∼70% as effective. Without an STI present in the assembly mixture, no trapped synaptic complex was observed. Fluorescence and mass spectroscopy analyses demonstrated that the STI remains associated with the trapped complex. SEC-multiangle light scattering analyses demonstrated that wild type IN and the C-terminal IN truncation are dimers that acted as precursors to the tetramer. The purified STI-trapped synaptic complex contained a tetramer as shown by cross-linking studies. Structural studies of this three-domain RSV IN in complex with viral DNA may be feasible.

Physical identification of an assembled IN-DNA complex capable of concerted integration has been successful. The HIV synaptic complex (SC) contains the viral DNA and IN (Fig. 1) and is the first complex in the integration pathway, detectable by native agarose gel electrophoresis (9Li M. Mizuuchi M.

Strand transfer inhibitors (STIs) directed against HIV IN are effective inhibitors in combination with other anti-retroviral drugs to prevent HIV replication in humans (17Di Santo R. Inhibiting the HIV integration process: past, present, and the future.J. Med. Chem. 2014; 57: 539-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Three IN STIs, raltegravir (RAL), elvitegravir (EVG), and dolutegravir (DTG), have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for HIV treatment. The STIs also inhibit strand transfer mediated by PFV IN and inhibit its replication (18Valkov E. Gupta S.S. Hare S. Helander A. Roversi P. McClure M. Cherepanov P.

The HIV IN STIs appear to trap SC by making contacts with both IN and DNA, as shown for the PFV intasome (6Hare S. Gupta S.S. Valkov E. Engelman A. Cherepanov P.

Gupta S.S. Hare S. Helander A. Roversi P. McClure M. Cherepanov P. Functional and structural characterization of the integrase from the prototype foamy virus.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), HIV IN STIs also have the ability to differentially inhibit the replication of Alpharetrovirus, Betaretrovirus, and Gammaretrovirus (27Koh Y. Matreyek K.A. Engelman A. Differential sensitivities of retroviruses to integrase strand transfer inhibitors.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 3677-3682Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that RSV IN would also be susceptible to inhibition by STIs. We demonstrate here that STIs at low nanomolar concentrations inhibit the concerted integration catalyzed by RSV IN as effectively as observed previously with HIV IN using similar large size DNA substrates (∼1 kb) (10Pandey K.K. Bera S. Zahm J. Vora A. Stillmock K. Hazuda D. Grandgenett D.P.

Physical trapping of HIV-1 synaptic complex by different structural classes of integrase strand transfer inhibitors.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 8376-8387Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Wild type (WT) RSV IN (1–286 residues) and C-terminally truncated INs (1–269, 1–270, and 1–274 residues) were shown to efficiently use 3′-OH-recessed ODN substrates for concerted integration. The slowly dissociating HIV IN STIs were very effective in trapping the assembled RSV SC in solution at high micromolar concentrations of IN and 3′-OH recessed viral DNA (18/20 bp). The STI-trapped RSV SC was soluble and stable upon Superdex 200 size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) in running buffer lacking STIs. Without STIs in the assembly mixture, no trapped SC structures were produced. SEC analysis of kinetically trapped SC with WT RSV IN(1–286) and the above C-terminal truncations in the RSV IN “tail” region (residues 269–286) demonstrated that IN(1–269) was sufficient to produce a homogeneous population of trapped SC. Further analyses of the oligomeric state of RSV IN in solution suggested that the RSV IN dimer is the precursor to the tetramer within the trapped RSV SC. Collectively, the results provide insights into the mechanism of RSV SC assembly and its interactions with STIs, and they suggest that future structural studies of the three-domain RSV IN in complex with viral DNA may be feasible. Recombinant WT RSV IN (1–286 residues) and its C-terminal truncated fragments (1–269, 1–270, and 1–274 residues) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)pLysS and purified to near homogeneity similar to procedures previously described (28McCord M.

RSV IN was concentrated to 10–30 mg/ml in a final buffer containing 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine, 2 mm MgSO4, 200 mm (NH4)2SO4, 50 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol. The purified INs were free of contaminating DNA endonuclease activities using supercoiled DNA as substrate. Strand transfer assays were performed using a linear 3.6-kb DNA donor substrate that possessed a single U3 long terminal repeat (LTR) DNA end and labeled with 32P at the 5′ LTR end (29Vora A. Bera S.

The substrate was produced by NdeI digestion of a circular plasmid generating a 2-bp 3′-OH recessed U3 end. The U3 end sequence was modified on the cleaved strand at nucleotide position 6 (T to A) producing a gain-of-function (GU3) substitution that possesses severalfold higher catalytic activity than the WT U3 sequence (29Vora A.

Briefly, RSV IN (20 nm) and donor DNA (0.5 nm) were preassembled at 14 °C for 15 min in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 8% polyethylene glycol 6000. Upon addition of supercoiled target DNA (2.7 kb)(1.5 nm), strand transfer was for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped with EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mm, and samples were deproteinized with 0.5% SDS, 1 mg/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 37 °C. Strand transfer products were separated on a 1.3% agarose gel, dried, and analyzed by a Typhoon Trio Laser Scanner (GE Healthcare). Solution conditions to efficiently promote concerted integration by HIV IN using ODN substrates (14Pandey K.K. Bera S. Grandgenett D.P.

The assay with 3′-OH recessed ODN substrate (18/20 bp) containing RSV GU3 LTR sequences typically contained 2 μm LTR substrate and 4 μm IN in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 (or MgSO4), 5 mm DTT, and 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). After initial preincubation of the IN/DNA mixture at 14 °C for 15 min, the supercoiled target DNA (10 nm) was added, and strand transfer was carried out at 37 °C for 45 min. The reactions were deproteinized as described above. Strand transfer products were separated on a 1.8% agarose gel, stained with SYBR Gold (Invitrogen), and analyzed by a Typhoon Trio Laser Scanner (GE Healthcare). The 3′ processing activities of RSV IN(1–286, 1–274, and 1–269) were determined using blunt-ended 32P-labeled 4.6-kb GU3-U5 substrate as described previously (29Vora A. Bera S. Grandgenett D.

RSV GU3 ODN substrates were prepared by annealing two complementary ODN that were synthesized and PAGE-purified by Integrated DNA Technologies (Iowa City, IA). The GU3 ODN substrates are designated by the length of their noncleaved strand and termed either 3′-OH recessed (R) or blunt (B)-ended. The sequences were as follows: 18R (5′-ATTGCATAAGACAACA-3′ and 5′-AATGTTGTCTTATGCAAT-3′); 20R (5′-GTATTGCATAAGACAACA-3′ and 5′-AATGTTGTCTTATGCAATAC-3′); 20B (5′-GTATTGCATAAGACAACATT-3′ and 5′-AATGTTGTCTTATGCAATAC-3′); and 22R (5′-GAGTATTGCATAAGACAACA-3′ and 5′-AATGTTGTCTTATGCAATACTC-3′). Two different 3′-OH recessed ODN with nonspecific sequences were also prepared: 21R-NSP (5′-GCAATGATACCGCGAGACC-3′ and 5′-TGGGTCTCGCGGTATCATTGC-3′) and 29R-NSP (5′-CGCCGCATACACTATTCTCAGAATGAC-3′ and 5′-CGGTCATTCTGAGAATAGTGTATGCGGCG-3′). We assembled STI-trapped SC in solution from RSV IN, 3′-OH recessed GU3 ODN and STIs. Optimized assembly reactions contained GU3 20R (15 μm) and IN(1–269) (45 μm) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1 m nondetergent sulfobetaine (NDSB-201), 5 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10% (v/v) DMSO, and 125 μm STI. The assembly process continued for 3 to 24 h at 4 °C in the dark because some STIs are light-sensitive. Variations from these standard assembly conditions were described in the text or figure legends as indicated. The trapped SC produced in the presence of an STI was analyzed by Superdex 200 size-exclusion chromatography as described below. Fractions containing the trapped SC eluting at ∼150 kDa were collected and analyzed as described. The STIs RAL, MK-2048, and MK-0536 were kindly provided by Merck, and DTG was supplied by GlaxoSmithKline. EVG and additional DTG were also purchased from Selleck Chemicals. Following assembly of the RSV-trapped SC in the presence of STIs, the samples were injected (∼100–500 μl) onto a Superdex 200 (10/300) (GE Healthcare) for SEC operating at 4 °C. The standard column running buffer was 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, 200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine. The column buffer was modified in certain experiments as indicated. The Superdex 200 column was calibrated with the following molecular mass standards: thyroglobulin (670 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), bovine γ-globulin (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), horse myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.3 kDa). STI-trapped RSV SC was purified by SEC. Fractions containing the trapped SC were collected and analyzed for the presence of STIs. The running buffer for SEC was devoid of glycerol as it may interfere with mass spectroscopy analysis. Samples were extracted with 3 volumes of HPLC-grade acetonitrile. The samples were vortexed for 5 min followed by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was dried under heated nitrogen and reconstituted in 100 μl with HPLC-grade acetonitrile for LC/MS/MS analysis. Standards containing MK-2048 were analyzed (100 or 500 ng/ml in acetonitrile). MK-2048 in the samples was identified via an LC/MS/MS system that consisted of an LC-20AD pump (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), an HTC PAL autosampler (Leap technologies, Carrboro, NC), and a Sciex API-4000 mass spectrometer in ESI mode (AB Sciex, Foster City, CA). The multiple reaction monitoring transition for MK-2048 was m/z, 462.06 > 303.9. The mobile phases consisted of 0.1% formic acid in HPLC grade water and 100% HPLC grade acetonitrile with an Armor C18 reverse phase column (2.1 × 30 mm, 5 μm, Analytical Sales and Services, Pompton Plains, NJ) at a flow rate of 0.35 ml/min. The starting phase was 10% acetonitrile for 0.9 min, then increased to 90% acetonitrile over 0.4 min, and maintained for 0.2 min before returning to 10% acetonitrile over 0.4 min, and then held for 1.6 min at 10% acetonitrile. The presence of RAL and MK-0536 within the trapped RSV SC was determined by fluorescence spectroscopy. Samples were prepared by acetonitrile extraction as described earlier. The excitation and emission maxima for RAL and MK-0536 were empirically determined using a Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorimeter (Jobin Yvon, Inc., Edison, NJ). RAL exhibited excitation and emission maxima at 310 and 410 nm, respectively. These maxima for RAL matched a previous report (30Poirier J.M. Robidou P. Jaillon P. Quantification of the HIV-integrase inhibitor raltegravir (MK-0518) in human plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection.J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2008; 867: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The excitation and emission maxima for MK-0536 were 350 and 455 nm, respectively. The oligomeric form of RSV IN(1–269) in the DTG-trapped SC was determined. Fractions spanning the DTG-trapped SC peak were cross-linked with EGS at 22 °C for 10 min. An equivalent amount of IN(1–269) was purified by SEC and cross-linked with EGS in parallel. The SEC running buffer contained 0.4 m NaCl and lacked (NH4)2 SO4. The cross-linking reactions were quenched with 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, for 10 min on ice and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Krypton (Thermo Scientific). The absolute molecular weights of RSV IN(1–269, 1–274, and 1–286) as well as STI-trapped SC were determined by SEC on Superdex 200 (10/300) connected in-line with multiangle light scattering (MALS) mini-DAWN TREOS equipped with a 658-nm laser (Wyatt Technology Corp., Santa Barbara, CA) coupled with refractive index measurement by Optilab T-rEX (Wyatt Technology). The molar mass of IN and trapped SC was calculated from the observed light scattering intensity and differential refractive index using Zimm scattering model in ASTRA software (Wyatt Technology). To determine the absolute molar mass of trapped SC, a dn/dc of 0.185 and 0.170 was used for protein and DNA components, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2076999188,"A major task in computational biology is the discovery of short recurring string patterns known as motifs. Most of the schemes to discover motifs are either stochastic or combinatorial in nature. Stochastic approaches do not guarantee finding the correct motifs, while the combinatorial schemes tend to have an exponential time complexity with respect to motif length. To alleviate the cost, the combinatorial approach exploits dynamic data structures such as trees or graphs. Recently (Karci (2009) Efficient automatic exact motif discovery algorithms for biological sequences, Expert Systems with Applications 36:7952-7963) devised a deterministic algorithm that finds all the identical copies of string motifs of all sizes [Formula: see text] in theoretical time complexity of [Formula: see text] and a space complexity of [Formula: see text] where [Formula: see text] is the length of the input sequence and [Formula: see text] is the length of the longest possible string motif. In this paper, we present a significant improvement on Karci's original algorithm. The algorithm that we propose reports all identical string motifs of sizes [Formula: see text] that occur at least [Formula: see text] times. Our algorithm starts with string motifs of size 2, and at each iteration it expands the candidate string motifs by one symbol throwing out those that occur less than [Formula: see text] times in the entire input sequence. We use a simple array and data encoding to achieve theoretical worst-case time complexity of [Formula: see text] and a space complexity of [Formula: see text] Encoding of the substrings can speed up the process of comparison between string motifs. Experimental results on random and real biological sequences confirm that our algorithm has indeed a linear time complexity and it is more scalable in terms of sequence length than the existing algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W2074321961,"This paper presents a novel object detection method using a single instance from the object category. Our method uses biologically inspired global scene context criteria to check whether every individual location of the image can be naturally replaced by the query instance, which indicates whether there is a similar object at this location. Different from the traditional detection methods that only look at individual locations for the desired objects, our method evaluates the consistency of the entire scene. It is therefore robust to large intra-class variations, occlusions, a minor variety of poses, low-revolution conditions, background clutter etc., and there is no off-line training. The experimental results on four datasets and two video sequences clearly show the superior robustness of the proposed method, suggesting that global scene context is important for visual detection/localization."
https://openalex.org/W2075883209,"The late events of the budding yeast cell division cycle, cytokinesis and cell separation, require the assembly of a contractile actomyosin ring (CAR), primary and secondary septum formation followed by enzymatic degradation of the primary septum. Here we present evidence that demonstrates a role for the budding yeast amphiphysin complex, a heterodimer comprising Rvs167 and Rvs161, in CAR assembly and cell separation. The iqg1-1 allele is synthetically lethal with both rvs167 and rvs161 null mutations. We show that both Iqg1 and the amphiphysin complex are required for CAR assembly in early anaphase but cells are able to complete assembly in late anaphase when these activities are, respectively, either compromised or absent. Amphiphysin dependent CAR assembly is dependent upon the Rvs167 SH3 domain, but this function is insufficient to explain the observed synthetic lethality. Dosage suppression of the iqg1-1 allele demonstrates that endocytosis is required for the default cell separation pathway in the absence of CAR contraction but is unlikely to be required to maintain viability. The amphiphysin complex is required for normal, post-mitotic, localization of Chs3 and the Rho1 GEF, Rom2, which are responsible for secondary septum deposition and the accumulation of GTP bound Rho1 at the bud neck. It is concluded that a failure of polarity establishment in the absence of CAR contraction and amphiphysin function leads to loss of viability as a result of the consequent cell separation defect."

https://openalex.org/W1968670053,"Neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus occurs constitutively throughout postnatal life. Adult neurogenesis includes a multistep process that ends with the formation of a postmitotic and functionally integrated new neuron. During adult neurogenesis, various markers are expressed, including GFAP, nestin, Pax6, polysialic acid-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), neuronal nuclei (NeuN), doublecortin, TUC-4, Tuj-1, and calretinin. Prosaposin is the precursor of saposins A–D; it is found in various organs and can be excreted. Strong prosaposin expression has been demonstrated in the developing brain including the hippocampus, and its neurotrophic activity has been proposed. This study investigated changes in prosaposin in the dentate gyrus of young and adult rats using double immunohistochemistry with antibodies to prosaposin, PSA-NCAM, and NeuN. Prosaposin immunoreactivity was intense in the dentate gyrus at postnatal day 3 (P3) and P7, but decreased gradually after P14. In the dentate gyrus at P28, immature PSA-NCAM-positive neurons localized exclusively in the subgranular zone were prosaposin-negative, whereas mature Neu-N-positive neurons were positive for prosaposin. Furthermore, these prosaposin-negative immature neurons were saposin B-positive, suggesting that the neurons take up and degrade prosaposin. In situ hybridization assays showed that prosaposin in the adult dentate gyrus is dominantly the Pro+9 type, a secreted type of prosaposin. These results imply that prosaposin secreted from mature neurons stimulates proliferation and maturation of immature neurons in the dentate gyrus."
