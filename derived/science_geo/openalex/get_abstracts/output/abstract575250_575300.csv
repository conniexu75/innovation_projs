Single Lgr5+ stem cells can be cultured into three-dimensional organoids containing all intestinal epithelial cell types at near-normal ratios. Conditions to generate the main cell types (enterocyte, goblet cells, Paneth cells, and M cells) are well established, but signals to induce the spectrum of hormone-producing enteroendocrine cells (EECs) have remained elusive. Here, we induce Lgr5+ stem cell quiescence in vitro by blocking epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in organoids and show that their quiescent state is readily reverted. Quiescent Lgr5+ stem cells acquire a distinct molecular signature biased toward EEC differentiation. Indeed, combined inhibition of Wnt, Notch, and MAPK pathways efficiently generates a diversity of EEC hormone-expressing subtypes in vitro. Our observations uncouple Wnt-dependent stem cell maintenance from EGF-dependent proliferation and provide an approach for the study of the elusive EECs in a defined environment."

https://openalex.org/W3100321173,"We demonstrate a fiber-integrated quantum optical circulator that is operated by a single atom and that relies on the chiral interaction between emitters and transversally confined light. Like its counterparts in classical optics, our circulator exhibits an inherent asymmetry between light propagation in the forward and the backward direction. However, rather than a magnetic field or a temporal modulation, it is the internal quantum state of the atom that controls the operation direction of the circulator. This working principle is compatible with preparing the circulator in a coherent superposition of its operational states. Such a quantum circulator may thus become a key element for routing and processing quantum information in scalable integrated optical circuits. Moreover, it features a strongly nonlinear response at the single-photon level, thereby enabling, e.g., photon number-dependent routing and novel quantum simulation protocols."

We have investigated the underlying mechanisms by looking at gene expression, chromatin states, and TF binding during the uniquely efficient Ngn2, Isl1, and Lhx3 motor neuron programming pathway.

Direct programming by the overexpression of transcription factors (TFs) promises to improve in vitro disease modeling and produce clinically relevant cell types for future cell replacement therapies. During embryonic development or in vitro directed differentiation, cells acquire their terminal fate by progressively transitioning through intermediate progenitor stages. Accordingly, the transcriptional profile and chromatin states are also progressively shaped until they reach the terminal state (Gifford et al., 2013Gifford C.A. Ziller M.J. Gu H. Trapnell C. Donaghey J. Tsankov A. Shalek A.K. Kelley D.R. Shishkin A.A. Issner R. et al.Transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics during specification of human embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2013; 153: 1149-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). On the other hand, successful direct programming requires that the derived transcriptional network completely replaces the resident one without the benefit of transitioning through the developmental intermediate progenitor states. Thus, there are several unanswered questions about this abrupt transition. Are all terminal genes upregulated with the same kinetics and do they all follow similar chromatin trajectories? Do the programming TFs directly associate with terminal genes or do their binding targets change as programming progresses? What is the role of transcription factors induced at early programming stages? Without such guiding principles to help design direct programming strategies for generating cells that are copies of those found in vivo, most current direct programming protocols remain inefficient. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying such drastic cell fate transitions will be instrumental to improving the efficiency of direct programming protocols. Programming TFs must activate cell-specific genes when expressed in cellular and epigenetic conditions alien to those they face during embryonic development. These cell-specific gene targets may not be accessible or expression-competent in the initial cell state. How programming TFs engage the genome was investigated during the programming of two diametrically opposite cell fates, leading to two alternative models. Soufi et al., 2012Soufi A. Donahue G. Zaret K.S.

In a small percentage of the cells, the OSKM factors have the ability to bind to repressed chromatin domains and activate pluripotency gene expression (Soufi et al., 2012Soufi A. Donahue G.

Pioneer transcription factors target partial DNA motifs on nucleosomes to initiate reprogramming.Cell. 2015; 161: 555-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Alternatively, during programming of excitatory neurons from fibroblasts, Ascl1 is proposed to rapidly bind “on-target” to a set of terminal state regulatory regions (Wapinski et al., 2013Wapinski O.L. Vierbuchen T. Qu K. Lee Q.Y. Chanda S. Fuentes D.R. Giresi P.G. Ng Y.H. Marro S. Neff N.F. et al.Hierarchical mechanisms for direct reprogramming of fibroblasts to neurons.Cell. 2013; 155: 621-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The contrasting programming TF behaviors (dynamic off-target versus static on-target) could be due to intrinsic differences when programming rapidly dividing pluripotent cells versus a postmitotic neuron. However, the low efficiency of most programming protocols to terminal fates precludes the investigation of chromatin and transcription factor dynamics at regulatory regions and genes without confounding signals from cells that are not following a productive programming path. Therefore, although the programming processes have begun to be delineated, the chromatin trajectories and functions of genes induced during such cellular conversions remain obscure. In an extreme case of rapid and efficient direct programming, we have recently shown that the expression of Ngn2, Isl1, and Lhx3 TFs (the NIL factors) directly programs spinal motor neuron fate without the application of patterning signals (Mazzoni et al., 2013Mazzoni E.O. Mahony S. Closser M. Morrison C.A. Nedelec S. Williams D.J. An D. Gifford D.K. Wichterle H. Synergistic binding of transcription factors to cell-specific enhancers programs motor neuron identity.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). When expressed in pluripotent cells, the NIL factors program motor neuron fate within 48 hr, bypassing all intermediate motor neuron progenitor states. The terminal motor neurons share cellular and molecular properties with motor neurons generated during development. The expression of the NIL factors in pluripotent stem cells has two clear advantages as a model of TF-mediated direct programming. First, NIL expression programs spinal motor neurons, a specific cell type that has a known correlate in vivo (Dasen and Jessell, 2009Dasen J.S. Jessell T.M. Hox networks and the origins of motor neuron diversity.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2009; 88: 169-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, Jessell, 2000Jessell T.M. Neuronal specification in the spinal cord: inductive signals and transcriptional codes.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar) and is a desired programming target for clinical applications. Thus, it is possible to precisely measure the cellular outcome. Second, NIL programming is extremely efficient, above 90%, making it possible to study productive and effective direct programming without the confounding signals of cells that failed to achieve complete terminal fate. To understand how cells transition from a rapidly dividing pluripotent stem cell to a postmitotic spinal motor neuron, we investigated the dynamics of the transcriptome, chromatin landscape, and programming TF binding during the first 48 hr after NIL expression (Figures 1A and S1A). Our results revealed that NIL-directed programming is the product of a transcriptional and chromatin multi-step cascade. We suggest that motor neuron programming is the result of two independent regulatory modules induced by Ngn2 and the Isl1/Lhx3 pair that converge with a feedforward regulatory logic by the activity of the Onecut and Ebf TF families. Direct programming is characterized by the activity of one or more regulators that force the establishment of a different transcriptional network and thus a new cell fate. We have previously reported the drastic transcriptional transformation that results from NIL expression in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (Mazzoni et al., 2013Mazzoni E.O. Mahony S. Closser M. Morrison C.A. Nedelec S. Williams D.J. An D. Gifford D.K. Wichterle H. Synergistic binding of transcription factors to cell-specific enhancers programs motor neuron identity.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, we did not analyze two important aspects of this transformation: the programming trajectory and the homogeneity of the terminal cell population. We thus investigated these aspects using single cell RNA-sequencing (seq). We performed single cell expression analysis before inducing the NIL factors and at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, and 48 hr after treating the inducible NIL cells with doxycycline and successfully sequenced a total of 368 cells. We used diffusion maps to estimate pseudo-time ordering for each cell into a differentiation progression path (Haghverdi et al., 2015Haghverdi L. Buettner F. Theis F.J. Diffusion maps for high-dimensional single-cell analysis of differentiation data.Bioinformatics. 2015; 31: 2989-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Organizing the cells by differentiation pseudo-time reveals a remarkably unidirectional trajectory with no apparent branching points or roadblocks to programming motor neurons within 48 hr (Figure 1B). Reassuring to our unsupervised path reconstruction and as expected from the differentiation protocol, the differentiation pseudo-time trajectory contains a unique starting point. Moreover, single cell expression analysis of a selected group of genes (n = 705) reveals different activation and repression kinetics during programming, also recovered with the cell population average observed in bulk RNA-seq (Figure S1B). Thus, NIL programming factors induce a series of transcriptional changes that directly programs postmitotic motor neuron fate from pluripotent cells through a single differentiation trajectory. Moreover, these results suggest that NIL programming dynamics can be assessed using population-wide assays like bulk RNA-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq without loss of temporal resolution. In stepwise cell differentiation, progressive chromatin changes at promoters restrict the differentiation potential as cells become more differentiated, while the chromatin landscape must be rapidly transformed to complete programming. To understand chromatin dynamics during motor neuron programming, we performed a ChIP-seq time series (0 hr, 12 hr, 24 hr, and 48 hr after NIL induction) for histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), and acetylation (H3K27ac) (Figure 1A). To discover groups of promoters based on their histone modification time-course profiles, we designed a conditional Gaussian Bayesian network model (Lauritzen and Wermuth, 1989Lauritzen S.L. Wermuth N. Graphical models for associations between variables, some of which are qualitative and some quantitative.Ann. Stat. 1989; 17: 31-57Crossref Google Scholar, Pearl, 1988Pearl J. Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems: Networks of Plausible Inference. Morgan Kaufmann Series in Representation and Reasoning, 1988Google Scholar) that can learn and classify combinatorial time-course trajectories of multiple ChIP-seq data sets such that a given cluster represents the dynamic trajectories of all analyzed histone modifications together (Figure S1C). The model assumes that each histone modification is independent of all others given the cluster assignment and operates on the fold changes between the time points for each histone modification assuming that a given fold change value for a given histone modification is dependent upon the preceding fold change value (Figure S1C; see STAR Methods). We applied this model to cluster promoter regions based on the combinatorial trajectories of H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3 histone modifications into 11 promoter classes (P1 to P11; Figures 1C and S1D). Grouping those promoter classes into three broad groups for upregulation, downregulation, and no-change reveals that promoters follow multiple distinct activation and repression trajectories, which in turn correspond to distinct gene expression dynamics (Figure 1C). This is reflected in the extent of up- or downregulation as well as the slope of change in gene expression. Scaling the expression of each gene and visualizing the scaled values as a heatmap shows that different promoter groups correspond to different up- and downregulation kinetics (Figure 1D). The highest promoter and transcription activation occurs in P1 promoters, which start in a bivalent H3K4me3/H3K27me3 state (Figure S1E) and resolve into an active H3K4me3/H3K27ac state (Bernstein et al., 2006Bernstein B.E.

In contrast, P7 promoters show an opposite trend where they start in an active H3K4me3/H3K27ac state and switch to a repressed H3K27me3 state, also reflected in a strong and rapid decrease in gene expression. GO and Reactome analysis show enrichment for pluripotency genes in this group (Table S1). Similar to P1 promoters, P10 promoters start in a bivalent H3K4me3/H3K27me3 state (Figure S1E), but are not activated during differentiation. GO analysis indicates a general enrichment for cell fate specification showing that this group includes cell-fate specific genes that are not activated during motor neuron differentiation. The contrast between P1, P7, and P10 promoters suggests that during NIL induction pluripotency genes (e.g., Lin28a, Fgf4, Oct4, and Sox2) are repressed as stem cell fate is extinguished, presumably by the activity of the programming factors and culture conditions, while neuron (e.g., Tubb3) and motor neuron genes (e.g., Chat, Isl2, and Hb9) are activated, and genes related to other developmental pathways are unchanged (e.g., Tead4, Tbx5, and GATA6) (Figures 1C and 1D). Therefore, NIL induction in a chromatin environment distinct to that encountered during normal development results in significant promoter chromatin remodeling consistent with a motor neuron fate. Further, these results reveal that even without transitioning through progenitor stages, bivalent chromatin states at promoters get resolved in a lineage specific manner as they do during stepwise differentiation. How does the forced expression of Ngn2, Isl1, and Lhx3 control a unidirectional differentiation trajectory with multiple dynamic expression and chromatin changes? To answer this question, we investigated the binding pattern of Ngn2, Isl1, and Lhx3 after induction and deployed MultiGPS, an integrative machine-learning approach for profiling multi-condition ChIP-seq data sets (Mahony et al., 2014Mahony S. Edwards M.D. Mazzoni E.O. Sherwood R.I. Kakumanu A. Morrison C.A. Wichterle H. Gifford D.K. An integrated model of multiple-condition ChIP-seq data reveals predeterminants of Cdx2 binding.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2014; 10: e1003501Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (see STAR Methods). We found that Isl1 and Lhx3 co-occupy 98% of their bound regulatory regions at 12 hr postinduction (Figure 2A), consistent with what we previously reported at 48 hr (Mazzoni et al., 2013Mazzoni E.O. Mahony S. Closser M. Morrison C.A. Nedelec S. Williams D.J. An D. Gifford D.K. Wichterle H. Synergistic binding of transcription factors to cell-specific enhancers programs motor neuron identity.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, only ∼13% of Isl1/Lhx3 binding overlaps with Ngn2 at 12 hr (Figure 2B). Furthermore, GO term analysis of genes close to Ngn2 versus Isl1/Lhx3 bound regions shows that Isl1/Lhx3 binding is associated with specific spinal cord and motor neuron genes, while Ngn2 binding is associated with more generic neuronal differentiation activities (Table S2). These results suggest that Ngn2 controls genes associated with a more general neuronal fate, while Isl1 and Lhx3 activate motor neuron specific gene expression. To assess whether the programming factors stably associate with regulatory regions controlling motor neuron fate or if their binding patterns change over time following activation, we first profiled Isl1 and Lhx3 binding at 12 hr, 24 hr, and 48 hr using ChIP-seq. We also assessed Isl1 and Lhx3 binding at an earlier 8 hr time point, before the programming factors reach maximum level of expression. The binding pattern is almost identical (<8% difference) between 8 hr and 12 hr (Figure S2A), and therefore we used the latter more robust data as our baseline for early binding. Since Ngn2 protein levels rapidly decrease as cells become postmitotic (Mazzoni et al., 2013Mazzoni E.O. Mahony S. Closser M. Morrison C.A. Nedelec S. Williams D.J. An D. Gifford D.K. Wichterle H. Synergistic binding of transcription factors to cell-specific enhancers programs motor neuron identity.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we did not assess Ngn2 binding dynamics after 12 hr. Out of 14,969 sites bound by both Isl1 and Lhx3 observed during programming, we could confidently categorize 7,983 of them into three binding classes based on their dynamic behavior during programming (Figure 2C; since Isl1 and Lhx3 binding is highly correlated, we show only Lhx3 for simplicity). Of these categorized sites, 31% were assigned to an “early only” class, where programming factors bind at early stages of programming and lose their binding as cells transition into a postmitotic motor neuron fate. Another 48% of the binding events did not show any markedly differential ChIP enrichment over the course of programming and were assigned to a “constant” class. The programming factors engage these sites at early stages of programming and maintain their binding until cells are completely programmed. A further 21% were assigned to a “late only” class; these sites are only engaged later in the programming process. Therefore, Isl1 and Lhx3 binding divides into a group of sites constantly engaged during programming and sites that are dynamic even during the short 48 hr span of motor neuron programming. The plastic pluripotent state is often thought to be associated with chromatin states that are poised to be activated. Therefore, the high programming efficiency by the NIL factors might be due to their binding targets being mostly located in accessible chromatin in pluripotent cells. To investigate this model, we mapped accessibility by ATAC-seq (Buenrostro et al., 2013Buenrostro J.D. Giresi P.G. Zaba L.C. Chang H.Y. Greenleaf W.J. Transposition of native chromatin for fast and sensitive epigenomic profiling of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins and nucleosome position.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3217) Google Scholar) before NIL induction (0 hr; Figure 2D). ATAC-seq cut site counts at Ngn2, Isl1/Lhx3 early only; Isl1/Lhx3 constant; and Isl1/Lhx3 late only binding sites demonstrate that transient early binding by Ngn2 or Isl1/Lhx3 is split between accessible and inaccessible regulatory regions. However, Isl1/Lhx3 constant binding and late binding occur in regions that were mostly inaccessible by ATAC-seq before programming began (Figure S2B). Therefore, the high programming efficiency by NIL factors does not solely rely on binding sites being accessible prior to NIL expression, but is also associated with regulatory regions that are inaccessible in the initial cell fate. To identify the enhancers controlled by NIL and to understand if programming TF binding activates, decommissions, or is inconsequential for the chromatin state of regulatory elements, we asked whether enhancer chromatin dynamics correlates with Ngn2, Isl1, and Lhx3 binding during programming. Ngn2 binding to previously accessible regions largely took place in proximal promoter regions, whereas binding at inaccessible sites occurred distally to genes (Figure S2C). Consistent with its role activating the general neuronal program, proximal regulatory regions associated with Ngn2 accessible binding remain accessible and active (Figures 3A, 3B , S3A, and S3B). 0 hr-accessible early only Isl1/Lhx3 sites rapidly lose accessibility, H3K27ac, H3K4me2, and H3K4me1 during programming (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A). On the other hand, Isl1/Lhx3 constant and late only sites occur in regions of the genome with low initial accessibility and activity that change to accessible and active upon TF binding, as evident by an increase in ATAC-seq reads and a concomitant H3K27ac, H3K4me2, and H3K4me1 enrichment as programming progresses (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A). Therefore, early Isl1/Lhx3 binding to distal regulatory regions seems to be associated with decommissioning of enhancers active at the initial cell fate, while constant and late only Isl1 and Lhx3 binding promote enhancer activation. The fact that chromatin dynamics at regulatory elements directly correspond to Isl1/Lhx3 binding dynamics suggests that NIL binding dynamics might be directly responsible for the expression waves observed during programming (Figure 1C). Thus, we investigated if Ngn2, Isl1, and Lhx3 enhancer binding classes defined based on dynamics and accessibility (Figure 2D) are associated with our previously identified dynamic promoter classes (Figure 1C). To assign each binding site to a target promoter, we chose a “closest-promoter” model, where each TF binding site is assigned to its closest promoter region if the binding site is within 100 kb of the promoter region. Using the closest-promoter model, we measured the enrichment or depletion of association between transcription factor binding and dynamic promoter classes. This analysis revealed: (1) Although Ngn2 and Isl1/Lhx3 early binding to inaccessible enhancers does not clearly associate with a specific promoter class, Ngn2 and Isl1/Lhx3 early binding to accessible regions is associated with downregulated genes in agreement with the chromatin behavior at those binding sites (Figure 3C); (2) Isl1/Lhx3 constant sites are enriched in the proximity of strongly upregulated P1 and P2 promoters and depleted from downregulated P6 and P7 classes (Figure 3C); and (3) late only Isl1/Lhx3 sites are enriched in P2 and P3 cluster promoters that are upregulated later during programming (Figure 3C), but are depleted from downregulated promoters (Figure 3C). Together, these results suggest that the early binding of the NIL factors to accessible regions is associated with transcriptional downregulation. On the other hand, Isl1/Lhx3 constant and late binding activates regulatory regions controlling the transcriptional cascade during programming (Figure 3C). Of note, the closest-promoter model enriches for correlation between promoter chromatin trajectories and their assigned enhancer trajectories better than a simpler method that assigns promoters to all binding sites within 500 kb (Figure S3C and data not shown). Therefore, our data suggest a direct control of gene expression by the programming factors; NIL binding appears to regulate the local chromatin status at bound regulatory regions, and we see a surprising correlation between promoter and enhancer chromatin dynamics during motor neuron programming. The strong correlation of different classes of TF binding events with distinct chromatin and expression dynamics suggest that dissecting the mechanisms by which Isl1 and Lhx3 are recruited to their various regulatory regions during programming is required to understand the entire programming process. Enhancers are engaged by multiple transcription factors, and coordinated TF binding is often associated with enhancer activity during development and programming (Arnosti et al., 1996Arnosti D.N.

Thus, to identify other transcription factors that could influence Isl1 and Lhx3 binding dynamics during programming, we searched for overrepresented DNA sequence motifs in each of the three Isl1/Lhx3 dynamic binding categories (see STAR Methods). Constant Isl1/Lhx3 sites are characterized by more frequent instances of the primary Isl1/Lhx3 homeodomain motif than early only and late only sites, suggesting that Isl1 and Lhx3 recognize sites that contain favorable binding sequences and remain bound to these sites throughout the programming process (Figures 4A and S4A). A fraction of constant binding sites are also enriched for the E-box motif variant that is associated with Ngn2 and other bHLH factors such as Neurod1, also activated during programming. Indeed, many of those E-box containing sites are bound by Ngn2 during early stages of programming (Figure S4B), demonstrating that DNA sequence motifs can point to cooperative TF interactions. Interestingly, early only binding events have relatively less frequent instances of the primary Isl1/Lhx3 motif compared to constant sites. These early only sites are also enriched for motifs corresponding to the pluripotency factor Oct4 (Figures 4A and S4A) and are associated both with accessible chromatin (Figure 2D) and the binding of Oct4 at 0 hr (Figure S4C). Finally, late only binding sites also have less frequent instances of the Isl1/Lhx3 primary motif than constant sites. However, late only sites are enriched for motifs corresponding to Ebf and Onecut transcription factors (Figures 4A and S4A).

https://openalex.org/W2560238712,"Electrical brain stimulation (EBS) complements neural measurements by probing the causal relationship between brain and perception, cognition, and action. Many fundamental questions about EBS remain unanswered, including the spatial extent of cortex responsive to stimulation, and the relationship between the circuitry engaged by EBS and the types of neural responses elicited by sensory stimulation. Here, we measured neural responses and the effects of EBS in primary visual cortex in four patients implanted with intracranial electrodes. Using stimulation, behavior, and retinotopic mapping, we show the relationship between the size of affected cortical area and the magnitude of electrical charge. Furthermore, we show that the spatial location of electrically induced visual sensations is matched to the receptive field of the cortical site measured with broadband field potentials, and less so with event related potentials. Together, these findings broaden our knowledge about the mechanism of EBS and the neuromodulation of the human brain."

Kept in isolation, qubits can be stable. In a practical setting, however, qubits must be addressed and interact with each other. Such an environment is typically viewed as a source of decoherence and has a detrimental effect on a qubit's ability to retain encoded information. Gustavsson et al. used a sequence of pulses as a source of “environment shaping” that could substantially increase the coherence time of a superconducting qubit. Science , this issue p. 1573"
https://openalex.org/W2560740462,"A critical feature of neural networks is that they balance excitation and inhibition to prevent pathological dysfunction. How this is achieved is largely unknown, although deficits in the balance contribute to many neurological disorders. We show here that a microRNA (miR-101) is a key orchestrator of this essential feature, shaping the developing network to constrain excitation in the adult. Transient early blockade of miR-101 induces long-lasting hyper-excitability and persistent memory deficits. Using target site blockers in vivo, we identify multiple developmental programs regulated in parallel by miR-101 to achieve balanced networks. Repression of one target, NKCC1, initiates the switch in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling, limits early spontaneous activity, and constrains dendritic growth. Kif1a and Ank2 are targeted to prevent excessive synapse formation. Simultaneous de-repression of these three targets completely phenocopies major dysfunctions produced by miR-101 blockade. Our results provide new mechanistic insight into brain development and suggest novel candidates for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2560354931,"Generic spinal motor neuron identity is established by cooperative binding of programming transcription factors (TFs), Isl1 and Lhx3, to motor-neuron-specific enhancers. How expression of effector genes is maintained following downregulation of programming TFs in maturing neurons remains unknown. High-resolution exonuclease (ChIP-exo) mapping revealed that the majority of enhancers established by programming TFs are rapidly deactivated following Lhx3 downregulation in stem-cell-derived hypaxial motor neurons. Isl1 is released from nascent motor neuron enhancers and recruited to new enhancers bound by clusters of Onecut1 in maturing neurons. Synthetic enhancer reporter assays revealed that Isl1 operates as an integrator factor, translating the density of Lhx3 or Onecut1 binding sites into transient enhancer activity. Importantly, independent Isl1/Lhx3- and Isl1/Onecut1-bound enhancers contribute to sustained expression of motor neuron effector genes, demonstrating that outwardly stable expression of terminal effector genes in postmitotic neurons is controlled by a dynamic relay of stage-specific enhancers."

Apart from a role for dopamine deficiency in some forms, the cellular mechanisms underlying most dystonias are currently unknown. Here, we discover a role for deficient eIF2α signaling in DYT1 dystonia, a rare inherited generalized form, through a genome-wide RNAi screen. Subsequent experiments including patient-derived cells and a mouse model support both a pathogenic role and therapeutic potential for eIF2α pathway perturbations. We further find genetic and functional evidence supporting similar pathway impairment in patients with sporadic cervical dystonia, due to rare coding variation in the eIF2α effector ATF4. Considering also that another dystonia, DYT16, involves a gene upstream of the eIF2α pathway, these results mechanistically link multiple forms of dystonia and put forth a new overall cellular mechanism for dystonia pathogenesis, impairment of eIF2α signaling, a pathway known for its roles in cellular stress responses and synaptic plasticity."

In the last decades however, increasing socioeconomic and cultural transformations, including land-use change, outmigration, globalized markets, the introduction of new species, and climate change have led to a decreasing availability of indigenous resources, and are ultimately leading to a reduction of local use-knowledge. Participant observations, discussions, walks-in-the-woods, semi-structured interviews and informal meetings were carried out in 12 villages of far western Nepal between 2011 and 2015 to assess how sociocultural changes have affected the sustenance of indigenous systems and local biodiversity, when compared to studies carried out in the previous decades. Our findings show that there were no statistically significant differences in subject variable means, but differences were relatively important to plant parts-use and plant growth-forms (p = 0.183 and 0.088 respectively). Cissampelos pareira, Acorus calamus, Calotropis gigantea were found to have the greatest relative importance, whereas Ageratina adenophora, Melia azedarach, Carum carvi were most important based on use values. Among them, C. pareira and A. adenophora were introduced. The spatial distribution of species collected for medicine showed that all habitats were important for collection however, habitats close to villages were more favored. The use of non-indigenous and easily available species and more accessible habitats is becoming more prevalent as primary forests become increasingly overexploited, indigenous species become limited, and sociocultural cause of land use change expand. The utilization of indigenous and non-indigenous species and nearby habitats, although possibly affecting the quality of medicinal species, nonetheless reveals the dynamism of indigenous medicines as an adaptive asset mitigating human and non-human environmental changes."

Although phenazines exist in many forms, the best studied is pyocyanin. Here, we describe pyocyanin demethylase (PodA), a hitherto uncharacterized protein that oxidizes the pyocyanin methyl group to formaldehyde and reduces the pyrazine ring via an unusual tautomerizing demethylation reaction. Treatment with PodA disrupts P. aeruginosa biofilm formation similarly to DNase, suggesting interference with the pyocyanin-dependent release of extracellular DNA into the matrix. PodA-dependent pyocyanin demethylation also restricts established biofilm aggregate populations experiencing anoxic conditions. Together, these results show that modulating extracellular redox-active metabolites can influence the fitness of a biofilm-forming microorganism."

There is a little information concerning CTRP13 in the context of NAFLD and T2DM. We evaluated the plasma levels of CTRP13 in healthy control and patients with NAFLD, T2DM and NAFLD+T2DM, and also correlations between CTRP13 plasma levels and clinical and subclinical features. Circulating CTRP13 was examined in 88 male (20 healthy control, 22 T2DM patients, 22 NAFLD patients and 22 NAFLD+T2DM patients). CTRP13 and adiponectin plasma levels were measured by ELISA method. CTRP13 serum levels were higher in the control group than the other groups (all p <0.001). CTRP13 had significant negative correlation with unfavorable anthropometric and metabolic factors including BMI, visceral fat, Insulin, HOMA-IR, TG, AST, ALT and ɣ-GT and have a positive correlation with plasma concentration of adiponectin. CTRP13 had a significant inverse correlation with cIMT (r = -0.345) and liver stiffness (LS) (r = -0.372) (both, p <0.001). Also, the multiple stepwise linear regression has shown that visceral fat is a significant predictor of CTRP13 serum levels (p <0.001). Multiple stepwise linear regression with LS as the dependent variable showed that ALT (p < 0.001) and SBP (p = 0.010) were two predictor factors for LS. Strikingly, multiple stepwise linear regression showed that CTRP13 (p = 0.006) and SBP (p = 0.007) were two independent predictors for cIMT. Lower CTRP13 in patients with T2DM, NAFLD and NAFLD + T2DM was associated with increased risk of the diseases. CTRP13 have negative associations with unfavorable metabolic factors and also is a negative predictor of cIMT. Our results suggested that CTRP13 could be an associated factor with NAFLD in patients with and without T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W2559823817,"Transplantation of embryonic γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons has been shown to modify disease phenotypes in rodent models of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. However, whether transplanted interneurons modulate fear memory remains largely unclear. Here, we report that transplantation of embryonic interneurons into the amygdala does not alter host fear memory formation. Yet approximately 2 weeks after transplantation, but not earlier or later, extinction training produces a marked reduction in spontaneous recovery and renewal of fear response. Further analyses reveal that transplanted interneurons robustly form functional synapses with neurons of the host amygdala and exhibit similar developmental maturation in electrophysiological properties as native amygdala interneurons. Importantly, transplanted immature interneurons reduce the expression of perineuronal nets, promote long-term synaptic plasticity, and modulate both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmissions of the host circuits. Our findings demonstrate that transplanted immature interneurons modify amygdala circuitry and suggest a previously unknown strategy for the prevention of extinction-resistant pathological fear."
https://openalex.org/W2559854174,"HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are the most effective pharmacological means of reducing cardiovascular disease risk. The most common side effect of statin use is skeletal muscle myopathy, which may be exacerbated by exercise. Hypercholesterolemia and training status are factors that are rarely considered in the progression of myopathy. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which acute and chronic exercise can influence statin-induced myopathy in hypercholesterolemic (ApoE-/-) mice. Mice either received daily injections of saline or simvastatin (20 mg/kg) while: 1) remaining sedentary (Sed), 2) engaging in daily exercise for two weeks (novel, Nov), or 3) engaging in daily exercise for two weeks after a brief period of training (accustomed, Acct) (2x3 design, n = 60). Cholesterol, activity, strength, and indices of myofiber damage and atrophy were assessed. Running wheel activity declined in both exercise groups receiving statins (statin x time interaction, p<0.05). Cholesterol, grip strength, and maximal isometric force were significantly lower in all groups following statin treatment (statin main effect, p<0.05). Mitochondrial content and myofiber size were increased and 4-HNE was decreased by exercise (statin x exercise interaction, p<0.05), and these beneficial effects were abrogated by statin treatment. Exercise (Acct and Nov) increased atrogin-1 mRNA in combination with statin treatment, yet enhanced fiber damage or atrophy was not observed. The results from this study suggest that exercise (Nov, Acct) does not exacerbate statin-induced myopathy in ApoE-/- mice, yet statin treatment reduces activity in a manner that prevents muscle from mounting a beneficial adaptive response to training."

https://openalex.org/W2560588049,"The diagnosis of subacromial pathology is limited by the poor accuracy of clinical tests for specific pathologies. The aim of this study was to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of clinical examination and imaging features for identifying subacromial pain (SAP) defined by a positive response to diagnostic injection, and to evaluate the influence of imaging findings on the clinical diagnosis of SAP.In a prospective, diagnostic accuracy design, 208 consecutive patients presenting to their primary healthcare practitioner for the first time with a new episode of shoulder pain were recruited. All participants underwent a standardized clinical examination, shoulder x-ray series and diagnostic ultrasound scan. Results were compared with the response to a diagnostic block of xylocaineTM injected into the SAB under ultrasound guidance using ≥80% post-injection reduction in pain intensity as the positive anaesthetic response (PAR) criterion. Diagnostic accuracy statistics were calculated for combinations of clinical and imaging variables demonstrating the highest likelihood of a PAR. A PAR was reported by 34% of participants. In participants with no loss of passive external rotation, combinations of three clinical variables (anterior shoulder pain, strain injury, absence of symptoms at end-range external rotation (in abduction)) demonstrated 100% specificity for a PAR when all three were positive (LR+ infinity; 95%CI 2.9, infinity). A full-thickness supraspinatus tear on ultrasound increased the likelihood of a PAR irrespective of age (specificity 98% (95%CI 94, 100); LR+ 6.2; 95% CI 1.5, 25.7)). Imaging did not improve the ability to rule-out a PAR.Combinations of clinical examination findings and a full-thickness supraspinatus tear on ultrasound scan can help confirm, but not exclude, the presence of subacromial pain. Other imaging findings were of limited value for diagnosing SAP."
https://openalex.org/W2560248670,"The human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene is repressed in most somatic cells, whereas the expression of the mouse mTert gene is widely detected. To understand the mechanisms of this human-specific repression, we constructed bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) reporters using human and mouse genomic DNAs encompassing the TERT genes and neighboring loci. Upon chromosomal integration, the hTERT, but not the mTert, reporter was stringently repressed in telomerase-negative human cells in a histone deacetylase (HDAC)-dependent manner, replicating the expression of their respective endogenous genes. In chimeric BACs, the mTert promoter became strongly repressed in the human genomic context, but the hTERT promoter was highly active in the mouse genomic context. Furthermore, an unrelated herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) promoter was strongly repressed in the human, but not in the mouse, genomic context. These results demonstrated that the repression of hTERT gene was dictated by distal elements and its chromatin environment. This repression depended on class I HDACs and involved multiple corepressor complexes, including HDAC1/2-containing Sin3B, nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD), and corepressor of RE1 silencing transcription factor (CoREST) complexes. Together, our data indicate that the lack of telomerase expression in most human somatic cells results from its repressive genomic environment, providing new insight into the mechanism of long-recognized differential telomerase regulation in mammalian species.-Cheng, D., Zhao, Y., Wang, S., Zhang, F., Russo, M., McMahon, S.

https://openalex.org/W2560256699,"The unique potential of chloroplasts/thylakoids to harness light energy to transport electrons from H2O to various entities was exploited for reduction of Ag+ to generate nanoparticles (NPs). Spinach thylakoids/chloroplasts turned AgNO3 solutions brown in light, but not in dark. Besides showing Ag-NPs specific surface plasmon resonance band, these brown solutions showed presence of 5-30 nm crystalline NPs composed of Ag. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis revealed that Ag-NPs were biphasic composed of face-centered cubic Ag0 and cubic Ag2O. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data further corroborated the presence of Ag2O in Ag-NPs. Limited formation of Ag-NPs in dark and increased generation of Ag0/Ag2O-NPs with increase in light intensity (photon flux density) by thylakoids/chloroplasts, established the role of light-harvesting photosynthetic machinery in generation of Ag0/Ag2O-NPs. Potential of thylakoids/chloroplasts to generate Ag-NPs from Ag+ on exposure to red and blue wavelength regions of visible light of electromagnetic spectrum, further confirmed the involvement of photosynthetic electron transport in reduction of Ag+ and generation of Ag-NPs. While light energy mediated photosynthetic electron transport donates energized electrons extracted from H2O to Ag+ to form Ag0-NPs, O2 released as a by-product during photolysis of H2O oxidizes Ag0 to form Ag2O-NPs. Our findings furnish a novel, simple, economic and green method that can be exploited for commercial production of Ag0/Ag2O-NPs."
https://openalex.org/W2560654429,"The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is one of the principal hub proteins that transmit growth signals from upstream oncogene products including Ras and BRaf to downstream effector proteins. However, there are both reports supporting and refuting the increase in ERK activity in cancer tissues expressing the active Ras and BRaf proteins. We considered that the cell density might account for this discrepancy. To examine this possibility, we prepared Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells that expressed an active HRas, NRas, KRas, or BRaf and an ERK biosensor based on the principle of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). As we anticipated, expression of the active Ras or BRaf increased ERK activity at low cell densities. However, the ERK activity was markedly suppressed at high cell densities irrespective of the expression of the active Ras or BRaf. Western blotting analysis with Phos-tag gel revealed the decrease of tyrosine and threonine-diphosphorylated active ERK and the increase of tyrosine-monophosphorylated inactive ERK at high cell density. In addition, we found that calyculin A, an inhibitor for PPP-subfamily protein serine/threonine phosphatases, decreased the tyrosine-monophosphorylated ERK. Our study suggests that PPP-subfamily phosphatases may be responsible for cell density-dependent ERK dephosphorylation in cancer cells expressing active Ras or BRaf protein."
https://openalex.org/W2559828994,"The survival of the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) is threatened by devil facial tumour disease (DFTD). This transmissible cancer is usually fatal, and no successful treatments have been developed. In human studies, the small immunomodulatory molecule imiquimod is a successful immunotherapy, activating anti-tumour immunity via stimulation of toll-like receptor-7 (TLR7) signaling pathways. In addition, imiquimod is a potent inducer of apoptosis in human tumour cell lines via TLR7 independent mechanisms. Here we investigate the potential of imiquimod as a DFTD therapy through analysis of treated DFTD cell lines and Tasmanian devil fibroblasts. WST-8 proliferation assays and annexin V apoptosis assays were performed to monitor apoptosis, and changes to the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes were analysed using qRT-PCR. Our results show that DFTD cell lines, but not Tasmanian devil fibroblasts, are sensitive to imiquimod-induced apoptosis in a time and concentration dependent manner. Induction of apoptosis was accompanied by down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 and BCLXL genes, and up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic BIM gene. Continuous imiquimod treatment was required for these effects to occur. These results demonstrate that imiquimod can deregulate DFTD cell growth and survival in direct and targeted manner. In vivo, this may increase DFTD vulnerability to imiquimod-induced TLR7-mediated immune responses. Our findings have improved the current knowledge of imiquimod action in tumour cells for application to both DFTD and human cancer therapy."

The goal of this work was to evaluate the immuno-reactivity of antigens and identify candidates to be considered for development of a simple serological test for the detection of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense or T. b. rhodesiense infections, ideally both. Methodology/Principal Findings The reactivity of 35 antigens was independently evaluated by slot blot and ELISA against sera from both T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense infected patients and controls. The antigens that were most reactive by both tests to T. b. gambiense sera were the membrane proteins VSG LiTat 1.3, VSG LiTat 1.5 and ISG64. Reactivity to T. b. rhodesiense sera was highest with VSG LiTat 1.3, VSG LiTat 1.5 and SRA, although much lower than with T. b. gambiense samples. The reactivity of all possible combinations of antigens was also calculated. When the slot blot results of 2 antigens were paired, a VSG LiTat 1.3- ISG75 combination performed best on T. b. gambiense sera, while a VSG LiTat 1.3-VSG LiTat 1.5 combination was the most reactive using ELISA. A combination of SRA and either VSG LiTat 1.3 or VSG LiTat 1.5 had the highest reactivity on T. b. rhodesiense sera according to slot blot, while in ELISA, pairing SRA with either GM6 or VSG LiTat 1.3 yielded the best results. Conclusions This study identified antigens that were highly reactive to T. b. gambiense sera, which could be considered for developing a serological test for gambiense HAT, either individually or in combination. Antigens with potential for inclusion in a test for T. b. rhodesiense HAT were also identified, but because their reactivity was comparatively lower, a search for additional antigens would be required before developing a test for this form of the disease."

Methods Thirty-one children from Malawi aged 4–62 months were followed every 3 months and at intercurrent illness visits for ≤47 months (September 2009-December 2011). We compared malaria parasite carriage by blood smear microscopy (BS) and confirmed clinical malaria incidence (CCM, or positive BS with malaria symptoms) in children initiated on HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) with zidovudine, lamivudine, and either nevirapine (NVP), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, or lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV-rtv), a protease inhibitor. Results We found an association between increased time to recurrent positive BS, but not CCM, when anti-malarial treatment and LPV-rtv based ART were used concurrently and when accounting for a LPV-rtv and antimalarial treatment interaction (adjusted HR 0.39; 95% CI (0.17,0.89); p = 0.03). Conclusions LPV-rtv in combination with malaria treatment was associated with lower risk of recurrent positive BS, but not CCM, in HIV-infected children.

https://openalex.org/W2558268560,"The ability to reason about causality underlies key aspects of human cognition, but the extent to which non-humans understand causality is still largely unknown. The Aesop's Fable paradigm, where objects are inserted into water-filled tubes to obtain out-of-reach rewards, has been used to test casual reasoning in birds and children. However, success on these tasks may be influenced by other factors, specifically, object preferences present prior to testing or arising during pre-test stone-dropping training. Here, we assessed this 'object-bias' hypothesis by giving New Caledonian crows and 5-10 year old children two object-choice Aesop's Fable experiments: sinking vs. floating objects, and solid vs. hollow objects. Before each test, we assessed subjects' object preferences and/or trained them to prefer the alternative object. Both crows and children showed pre-test object preferences, suggesting that birds in previous Aesop's Fable studies may also have had initial preferences for objects that proved to be functional on test. After training to prefer the non-functional object, crows, but not children, performed more poorly on these two object-choice Aesop's Fable tasks than subjects in previous studies. Crows dropped the non-functional objects into the tube on their first trials, indicating that, unlike many children, they do not appear to have an a priori understanding of water displacement. Alternatively, issues with inhibition could explain their performance. The crows did, however, learn to solve the tasks over time. We tested crows further to determine whether their eventual success was based on learning about the functional properties of the objects, or associating dropping the functional object with reward. Crows inserted significantly more rewarded, non-functional objects than non-rewarded, functional objects. These findings suggest that the ability of New Caledonian crows to produce performances rivaling those of young children on object-choice Aesop's Fable tasks is partly due to pre-existing object preferences."

One of the major obstacles for the development of a cost-efficient process is the lack of resistance of currently used fungal enzymes to harsh conditions such as high temperature. Adapted, thermophilic microbial communities provide a huge reservoir of potentially interesting lignocellulose-degrading enzymes for improvement of the cellulose hydrolysis step. In order to identify such enzymes, a leaf and wood chip compost was enriched on a mixture of thermo-chemically pretreated wheat straw, poplar and Miscanthus under thermophile conditions, but in two different set-ups. Unexpectedly, metagenome sequencing revealed that incubation of the lignocellulosic substrate with compost as inoculum in a suspension culture resulted in an impoverishment of putative cellulase- and hemicellulase-encoding genes. However, mimicking composting conditions without liquid phase yielded a high number and diversity of glycoside hydrolase genes and an enrichment of genes encoding cellulose binding domains. These identified genes were most closely related to species from Actinobacteria, which seem to constitute important players of lignocellulose degradation under the applied conditions. The study highlights that subtle changes in an enrichment set-up can have an important impact on composition and functions of the microcosm. Composting-like conditions were found to be the most successful method for enrichment in species with high biomass degrading capacity."

However, because of increasing antibiotic resistance, other antibacterial agents are required, preferably ones that do not affect the beneficial intestinal microbiota of the host. This study evaluated the in vitro selective growth-inhibitory effect of 8-hydroxyquinoline (8HQ) on C. perfringens vs. bifidobacteria in a medium containing chicken ileal digesta. Prior to the experiments, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 8HQ and penicillin G were determined by broth microdilution assay. The minimum inhibitory concentration values of 8HQ for C. perfringens were 16–32 times lower than the values for bifidobacteria. Treatment of autoclaved and non-autoclaved chicken ileal digesta with 8HQ showed a selective anticlostridial effect. After incubation of C. perfringens with autoclaved ileal digesta for 3 h, all 8HQ concentrations tested (32–2048 μg/mL) significantly reduced C. perfringens bacterial count. In contrast, the same treatment had no or only a slight effect on bifidobacteria counts. Unlike 8HQ, penicillin G did not exhibit any selectivity. Similar results were obtained after incubation for 24 h. In non-autoclaved ileal digesta, all 8HQ concentrations tested significantly reduced C. perfringens bacterial counts after incubation for 30 min and 3 h, while no effect was observed on bifidobacteria. These results suggest that 8HQ may serve as a prospective veterinary compound for use against necrotic enteritis in poultry."
https://openalex.org/W2560685428,"Bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) is a Parapoxvirus that induces acute pustular skin lesions in cattle and is transmissible to humans. Previous studies have shown that BPSV encodes a distinctive chemokine-binding protein (CBP). Chemokines are critically involved in the trafficking of immune cells to sites of inflammation and infected tissue, suggesting that the CBP plays a role in immune evasion by preventing immune cells reaching sites of infection. We hypothesised that the BPSV-CBP binds a wide range of inflammatory chemokines particularly those involved in BPSV skin infection, and inhibits the recruitment of immune cells from the blood into inflamed skin. Molecular analysis of the purified protein revealed that the BPSV-CBP is a homodimeric polypeptide with a MW of 82.4 kDa whilst a comprehensive screen of inflammatory chemokines by surface plasmon resonance showed high-affinity binding to a range of chemokines within the CXC, CC and XC subfamilies. Structural analysis of BPSV-CBP, based on the crystal structure of orf virus CBP, provided a probable explanation for these chemokine specificities at a molecular level. Functional analysis of the BPSV-CBP using transwell migration assays demonstrated that it potently inhibited chemotaxis of murine neutrophils and monocytes in response to CXCL1, CXCL2 as well as CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5 chemokines. In order to examine the effects of CBP in vivo, we used murine skin models to determine its impact on inflammatory cell recruitment such as that observed during BPSV infection. Intradermal injection of BPSV-CBP blocked the influx of neutrophils and monocytes in murine skin in which inflammation was induced with lipopolysaccharide. Furthermore, intradermal injection of BPSV-CBP into injured skin, which more closely mimics BPSV lesions, delayed the influx of neutrophils and reduced the recruitment of MHC-II+ immune cells to the wound bed. Our findings suggest that the CBP could be important in pathogenesis of BPSV infections."

This means they can stave off AIDS and it vastly reduces the likelihood that they will transmit the virus to others. In keeping with this finding, the massive survey effort led by Columbia University's Mailman School of Health discovered that the rate of new infections in Zimbabwe and Zambia was substantially lower than previously estimated by modeling done by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) that relied on less rigorous data. This bolsters hopes that these countries are on the path to the UNAIDS goal of controlling their AIDS epidemics by 2030."

The company, Seattle, Washington–based Juno Therapeutics, has its most troubled trial on hold and is racing to figure out why patients suffered fatal brain swelling, called cerebral edema. Researchers elsewhere are grappling with possible ramifications for the breakthrough treatment, in which a patient9s T cells are genetically engineered to fight cancer. Called chimeric antigen receptor–T therapy, it goes up for drug approval next year. Doctors speculate that the cerebral edema could be due to the specific product tested and the trial9s patient population, rather than the overall strategy itself. But they9re mostly in the dark, and hope that additional research, including new animal models, could help explain what happened and why."
https://openalex.org/W2560229326,"A detailed, long-term ocean temperature record derived from corals on Christmas Island in Kiribati and other islands in the tropical Pacific shows that the extreme warmth of recent El Nino events reflects not just the natural ocean-atmosphere cycle but a new factor: global warming caused by human activity. Over the last 7000 years, El Ninos, which warm the eastern Pacific, waxed and waned. Then, during the 20th century, their intensity began to climb. The trend is likely to continue, boding ever-more-destructive El Ninos in the future. The finding helps settle a long-standing debate about the role of global warming in these events, which had been hard to resolve because records are short and spotty in the remote parts of the Pacific where El Nino hits hardest."

Immunotherapy has changed the face of cancer treatment. However, despite some success, most individuals do not respond to this type of treatment. One potential reason is the presence of immunosuppressive macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Kaneda et al. and De Henau et al. now show in mice that inhibiting the lipid kinase phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ), or deleting the gene that encodes it, turns immunosuppressive macrophages into immunostimulatory ones in a cell-intrinsic manner. Inhibiting PI3Kγ in tumor-bearing mice led to greater T cell activation within tumors and, when combined with clinically available immunotherapies, to reduced tumor growth and improved overall survival. Clinical trials testing whether this strategy will also work in people are ongoing.

DNA is packaged into chromatin, and it must be actively unpacked, or remodeled, for genes to be transcribed into mRNA. That mRNA, synthesized in the nucleus, is also packed onto proteins, forming mRNA ribonucleoparticles (mRNPs). mRNPs are then shunted into the cytoplasm. Babour et al. show that one of the chromatin remodeling machines, the enzyme complex ISW1, has a second role in checking that mRNPs are properly packaged and competent to be exported to the cytoplasm. The ISW1 complex binds directly to the premature mRNPs, retaining them in proximity to their transcription sites.

The Qatar Genome Programme (QGP) announced in late 2013 set a controversial goal of sequencing the complete genomes of all 300,000 native Qataris. QGP collaborators have now sequenced the full genomes of 3000 generally healthy citizens for a pilot project. Local and expat researchers from Qatari institutions are planning more than a dozen studies based on these initial DNA sequences, which were completed in June. But so far, no outside researchers have gotten their hands on the information, as QGP officials and scientists wrestle over data access issues."

Gravimeters sense tiny changes in the local gravitational field and are used in geological studies, mineral exploration, and civil engineering to detect underground voids. Typically the size and weight of a small microwave oven, their operation is mechanical: A test mass pulls on a sensitive spring, and any difference in extension is compared with a reference point. Cold atoms cooled to their quantum ground state offer a quantum mechanical approach for detecting gravity. Abend et al. have developed an onchip cold-atom interferometer in which the active part of the sensor, including atom cooling and interference, takes up less than a cubic centimeter. The on-chip approach offers the prospect of compact and sensitive gravimeters for field deployment.

Iron-bismuth compounds are of interest for extending the series of superconducting iron-pnictide materials, but the Fe-Bi bond has been elusive. One problem is the immiscibility of Bi in Fe. Walsh et al. report that the formation of FeBi2 can be observed under extreme pressure conditions created with diamond anvils. Previous work was unsuccessful with the lower-pressure (body-centered cubic) phase of iron, so pressures sufficient to create its face-centered cubic phase were needed. At pressures above 30 GPa and temperatures of ∼1500°C, a phase was observed in x-ray diffraction in which each iron atom coordinated to eight Bi atoms, along with stabilizing Bi-Bi interactions. Once formed, the material was stable down to 2.9 GPa.

Starving bacteria in the gut may turn a beneficial microbial community into one that enhances disease susceptibility. Desai et al. explored the effects of eating adequate dietary fiber in a model in which 14 well-characterized strains of human gut bacteria were inoculated into germfree mice. A diet deficient in fiber increased the abundance of bacteria that digest the polysaccharides in the mucin layer that lines the gut. Thus, instead of helping digest the polysaccharides in dietary fiber, the microbiota attacked the protective layer of the intestinal wall. This allowed an introduced bacterial pathogen to grow and cause lethal colitis. The results may help establish the amounts and types of fiber that best maintain the protective mucin layer in the colon.
