https://openalex.org/W2058379153,"By considering radioisotope dating as a problem in trace element detection, and by using the cyclotron as a high-energy mass spectrometer for this purpose, we have shown that one can greatly increase the maximum age that can be determined while simultaneously reducing the size of the sample required. The cyclotron can be used to detect atoms or simple molecules that are present at the 10(-16) level or greater. For (14)C dating one should be able to go back 40,000 to 100,000 years with 1- to 100-mg carbon samples; for (10)Be dating, 10 to 30 million years with 1-mm(3) to 10-cm(3) rock samples; for tritium dating, 160 years with a 1-liter water sample. The feasibility of the technique has been demonstrated experimentally by measuring the tritium/deuterium ratio in a sample 24 years old. For samples many half-lives old, the fractional error in the age is small even if rates of production or deposition of the isotopes. Although cyclotrons are expensive to build, their operating costs are relatively low. If several samples are dated per hour the cost per date may not be substantially higher than it is today for decay dating. There are already more than 50 cyclotrons in operation which have the potential to do radioisotope dating, and their application to important problems of dating and trace element analysis should prove very fruitful."
https://openalex.org/W2074485586,"Efforts to develop formulas for contrasting genetic interests of workers and queens in social Hymenoptera are complicated by many factors, including multiple matings by queens, oviposition by unmated females, and mating rivalry among genetic relatives (Hamilton's ""local mate competition""). Because of haplodiploid sex determination in Hymenoptera, when such influences are absent, queens benefit from 1:1 sex ratios of investment (male: female) in reproductive offspring, workers from 1:3 ratios among reproductive siblings. Reports of variable ratios, including many well above 1:3, and female biases in nonsocial Hymenoptera and diplodiploid termites, implicate local mate competition and raises questions about previous interpretations that workers have their way."
https://openalex.org/W2043685559,"Quarks of charge +1 and other anomalous hydrogen have been sought by using the 88-inch cyclotron at Berkeley as a high-energy mass spectrometer, with natural hydrogen and deuterium as the sources of ions. No quarks were observed, and limits were placed on their ratio to protons on the earth that vary from < 2 x 10(-19)for high masses (3 to 8.2 atomic mass units) to 10(-13) for the lowest masses (< (1/3) atomic mass unit)."

https://openalex.org/W2153927033,Nations usually locate their smaller administrative subdivisions in regions of highest population density. This report derives a precise form of the size-density relationship from the general assumption that social structures evolve in such a way as to minimize the total time expended by society in their operation. The result is confirmed empirically.

https://openalex.org/W1970549510,In a limited temperature range the partial pressure of gallium subsulfide (Ga(2)S) above gallium sesquisulfide (Ga(2)S(3)) increases when the temperature is decreased. The anomaly in the partial pressure is caused by changes with temperature in the equilibrium compositions of two solid phases that coexist at 1228 degrees +/- 3 degrees K. At this temperature the solids differ in sulfur content by 0.4 atomic percent sulfur.

Under such conditions spontaneous vocalizations were infrequent, and vocal responsiveness to a painful stimulus was substantially reduced."
https://openalex.org/W2067955445,"The rate of flow of a tagged species of a material substance through a permeable membrane is proportional to the rate of flow of the substance itself when, and only when, the species mole fraction of the substance is the same on both sides of the barrier. The ratio of the osmotic transfer coefficient of a substance in a particular barrier to the exchange coefficient, determinable with a tracer, is greater than 1."

In the alfalfa weevil, Hypera postica, this extraocular cutoff filter evidently works in conjunction with the compound eyes, enabling the insect to use visual cues in locating or recognizing its host plant."

Similar implants of hydrocortisone in the pituitary gland, and of cholesterol in the hypothalamus, had no noticeable effect on the adrenals."
