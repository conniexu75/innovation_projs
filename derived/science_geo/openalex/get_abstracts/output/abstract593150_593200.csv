https://openalex.org/W2747734729,"Mavacamten, formerly known as MYK-461 is a recently discovered novel small-molecule modulator of cardiac myosin that targets the underlying sarcomere hypercontractility of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, one of the most prevalent heritable cardiovascular disorders. Studies on isolated cells and muscle fibers as well as intact animals have shown that mavacamten inhibits sarcomere force production, thereby reducing cardiac contractility. Initial mechanistic studies have suggested that mavacamten primarily reduces the steady-state ATPase activity by inhibiting the rate of phosphate release of β-cardiac myosin-S1, but the molecular mechanism of action of mavacamten has not been described. Here we used steady-state and presteady-state kinetic analyses to investigate the mechanism of action of mavacamten. Transient kinetic analyses revealed that mavacamten modulates multiple steps of the myosin chemomechanical cycle. In addition to decreasing the rate-limiting step of the cycle (phosphate release), mavacamten reduced the number of myosin-S1 heads that can interact with the actin thin filament during transition from the weakly to the strongly bound state without affecting the intrinsic rate. Mavacamten also decreased the rate of myosin binding to actin in the ADP-bound state and the ADP-release rate from myosin-S1 alone. We, therefore, conclude that mavacamten acts on multiple stages of the myosin chemomechanical cycle. Although the primary mechanism of mavacamten-mediated inhibition of cardiac myosin is the decrease of phosphate release from β-cardiac myosin-S1, a secondary mechanism decreases the number of actin-binding heads transitioning from the weakly to the strongly bound state, which occurs before phosphate release and may provide an additional method to modulate myosin function."
https://openalex.org/W2747355438,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) present a significant risk to each other. AD and T2D are characterized by deposition of cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) and pancreatic human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), respectively. We investigated the role of amyloidogenic proteins in the interplay between these diseases. A novel double transgenic mouse model combining T2D and AD was generated and characterized. AD-related amyloid transgenic mice coexpressing hIAPP displayed peripheral insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and glucose intolerance. Aβ and IAPP amyloid co-deposition increased tau phosphorylation, and a reduction in pancreatic β-cell mass was detected in islets. Increased brain Aβ deposition and tau phosphorylation and reduced insulin levels and signaling were accompanied by extensive synaptic loss and decreased neuronal counts. Aβ immunization rescued the peripheral insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, suggesting a role for Aβ in T2D pathogenesis for individuals predisposed to AD. These findings demonstrate that Aβ and IAPP are key factors in the overlapping pathologies of AD and T2D.-Wijesekara, N., Ahrens, R., Sabale, M., Wu, L., Ha, K., Verdile, G., Fraser, P. E.

https://openalex.org/W2750260074,"Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) deacetylates and regulates many mitochondrial proteins to maintain health, but its functions are depressed in aging and obesity. The best-studied sirtuin, SIRT1, counteracts aging- and obesity-related diseases by deacetylating many proteins, but whether SIRT1 has a role in deacetylating and altering the function of SIRT3 is unknown. Here we show that SIRT3 is reversibly acetylated in the mitochondria and unexpectedly is a target of SIRT1 deacetylation. SIRT3 is hyperacetylated in aged and obese mice, in which SIRT1 activity is low, and SIRT3 acetylation at Lys57 inhibits its deacetylase activity and promotes protein degradation. Adenovirus-mediated expression of SIRT3 or an acetylation-defective SIRT3-K57R mutant in diet-induced obese mice decreased acetylation of mitochondrial long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, a known SIRT3 deacetylation target; improved fatty acid β-oxidation; and ameliorated liver steatosis and glucose intolerance. These SIRT3-mediated beneficial effects were not observed with an acetylation-mimic SIRT3-K57Q mutant. Our findings reveal an unexpected mechanism for SIRT3 regulation via SIRT1-mediated deacetylation. Improving mitochondrial SIRT3 functions by inhibiting SIRT3 acetylation may offer a new therapeutic approach for obesity- and aging-related diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2747982551,"The vitamin D endocrine system regulates mineral homeostasis through its activities in the intestine, kidney, and bone. Terminal activation of vitamin D3 to its hormonal form, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), occurs in the kidney via the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP27B1. Despite its importance in vitamin D metabolism, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of the gene for this enzyme, Cyp27b1, are unknown. Here, we identified a kidney-specific control module governed by a renal cell-specific chromatin structure located distal to Cyp27b1 that mediates unique basal and parathyroid hormone (PTH)-, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23)-, and 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated regulation of Cyp27b1 expression. Selective genomic deletion of key components within this module in mice resulted in loss of either PTH induction or FGF23 and 1,25(OH)2D3 suppression of Cyp27b1 gene expression; the former loss caused a debilitating skeletal phenotype, whereas the latter conferred a quasi-normal bone mineral phenotype through compensatory homeostatic mechanisms involving Cyp24a1. We found that Cyp27b1 is also expressed at low levels in non-renal cells, in which transcription was modulated exclusively by inflammatory factors via a process that was unaffected by deletion of the kidney-specific module. These results reveal that differential regulation of Cyp27b1 expression represents a mechanism whereby 1,25(OH)2D3 can fulfill separate functional roles, first in the kidney to control mineral homeostasis and second in extra-renal cells to regulate target genes linked to specific biological responses. Furthermore, we conclude that these mouse models open new avenues for the study of vitamin D metabolism and its involvement in therapeutic strategies for human health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2750510341,"The very low-frequency (VLF) band of heart rate variability (HRV) has different characteristics compared with other HRV components. Here we investigated differences in HRV changes after a mental stress task. After the task, the high-frequency (HF) band and ratio of high- to low-frequency bands (LF/HF) immediately returned to baseline. We evaluated the characteristics of VLF band changes after a mental stress task. We hypothesized that the VLF band decreases during the Stroop color word task and there would be a delayed recovery for 2 h after the task (i.e., the VLF change would exhibit a ""slow recovery""). Nineteen healthy, young subjects were instructed to rest for 10 min, followed by a Stroop color word task for 20 min. After the task, the subjects were instructed to rest for 120 min. For all subjects, R-R interval data were collected; analysis was performed for VLF, HF, and LF/HF ratio. HRV during the rest time and each 15-min interval of the recovery time were compared. An analysis of the covariance was performed to adjust for the HF band and LF/HF ratio as confounding variables of the VLF component. HF and VLF bands significantly decreased and the LF/HF ratio significantly increased during the task compared with those during rest time. During recovery, the VLF band was significantly decreased compared with the rest time. After the task, the HF band and LF/HF ratio immediately returned to baseline and were not significantly different from the resting values. After adjusting for HF and LF/HF ratio, the VLF band had significantly decreased compared with that during rest. The VLF band is the ""slow recovery"" component and the HF band and LF/HF ratio are the ""quick recovery"" components of HRV. This VLF characteristic may clarify the unexplained association of the VLF band in cardiovascular disease prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2750499077,"TBC1 domain family member 1 (TBC1D1), a Rab GTPase-activating protein and paralogue of Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160), has been implicated in both insulin- and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase-mediated glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation. However, the role of TBC1D1 in contracting muscle remains ambiguous. We therefore explored the metabolic consequence of ablating TBC1D1 in both resting and contracting skeletal muscles, utilizing a rat TBC1D1 KO model. Although insulin administration rapidly increased (p < 0.05) plasma membrane GLUT4 content in both red and white gastrocnemius muscles, the TBC1D1 ablation did not alter this response nor did it affect whole-body insulin tolerance, suggesting that TBC1D1 is not required for insulin-induced GLUT4 trafficking events. Consistent with findings in other models of altered TBC1D1 protein levels, whole-animal and ex vivo skeletal muscle fat oxidation was increased in the TBC1D1 KO rats. Although there was no change in mitochondrial content in the KO rats, maximal ADP-stimulated respiration was higher in permeabilized muscle fibers, which may contribute to the increased reliance on fatty acids in resting KO animals. Despite this increase in mitochondrial oxidative capacity, run time to exhaustion at various intensities was impaired in the KO rats. Moreover, contraction-induced increases in sarcolemmal GLUT4 content and glucose uptake were lower in the white gastrocnemius of the KO animals. Altogether, our results highlight a critical role for TBC1D1 in exercise tolerance and contraction-mediated translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in skeletal muscle.

Altogether, our results highlight a critical role for TBC1D1 in exercise tolerance and contraction-mediated translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle glucose uptake in response to either insulin or contraction is a highly regulated process that results in facilitated diffusion through glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4). 3The abbreviations used are: GLUT4glucose transporter type 4GAPGTPase-activating proteinTBC1D1TBC1 (Tre-2, BUB2, CDC16) domain family member 1AS160Akt substrate of 160 kDaAMPK5′-AMP-activated protein kinaseβ-HADβ-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenaseFATfatty acid transporterGTTglucose tolerance testITTinsulin tolerance testRERrespiratory exchange ratioEDLextensor digitorum longusP-CoApalmitoyl-CoAACCacetyl-CoA carboxylase2-DG2-deoxyglucosePCrphosphocreatine.

Akt2 (also known as protein kinase B (PKB)) is a proximal member of the insulin signaling cascade, and its phosphorylation is an essential step in insulin-stimulated glucose transport (3Gonzalez E. McGraw T.E. Insulin signaling diverges into Akt-dependent and -independent signals to regulate the recruitment/docking and the fusion of GLUT4 vesicles to the plasma membrane.Mol. Biol.

Although the terminal downstream factors of both of these cascades are currently not fully understood, the binding of Rab-GTPases to GLUT4-containing vesicles is thought to be critical for translocation in both processes (8Fukuda M.

Rab GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) are members of the Ras superfamily of monomeric G-proteins that regulate numerous membrane trafficking events, including vesicle formation and movement along actin and tubulin networks, as well as membrane fusion. Two protein members of the TBC1 (Tre-2, BUB2, CDC16) domain family member 1 (TBC1D1) and TBC1D4 (also known as AS160) are functional GAPs that are believed to prevent GLUT4 translocation by maintaining Rabs in their inactive GDP-bound state (8Fukuda M. TBC proteins: GAPs for mammalian small GTPase Rab?.Biosci. Rep. 2011; 31: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although AS160 and TBC1D1 are only 61% similar in sequence over their entire length, their Rab GAP domains are 91% similar and have the same Rab substrate specificity (9Roach W.G. Chavez J.A. Mîinea C.P. Lienhard G.E. Substrate specificity and effect on GLUT4 translocation of the Rab GTPase-activating protein Tbc1d1.Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Upstream intracellular signaling events (e.g. insulin stimulation or contraction) result in the phosphorylation of AS160 and TBC1D1 and binding of these proteins to the molecular adaptor protein 14-3-3. Ultimately, these events enable GAPs to return to an active GTP-bound state and initiate vesicle exocytosis and trafficking of GLUT4 transporters (8Fukuda M. TBC proteins: GAPs for mammalian small GTPase Rab?.Biosci. Rep. 2011; 31: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Work in cell lines has shown that deletion of TBC1D1 increases GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane (10Ishikura S. Klip A.

Paradoxically, results in animals lacking TBC1D1 show no difference in whole-body glucose or insulin tolerance, whereas in vivo maximal insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle glucose uptake is impaired (12Szekeres F.

Targeted disruption of the glucose transporter 4 selectively in muscle causes insulin resistance and glucose intolerance.Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 924-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Therefore, one possible explanation for the decrease in glucose transport in TBC1D1-deficient mice is the decrease in GLUT4 protein content, making interpretations on the functional role of TBC1D1 with respect to intracellular trafficking difficult. Nevertheless, the decreased GLUT4 content suggests that TBC1D1 influences glucose homeostasis and may represent a compensatory attempt by the cell to maintain glucose homeostasis and limit glucose flux into the muscle.

Furthermore, phosphorylation of TBC1D1 via AMPK leads to a greater decrease in electrophoretic mobility compared with Akt, suggesting that AMPK is a more robust regulator of this protein than insulin (18Taylor E.B.

Although the precise role of TBC1D1 in glucose transport appears uncertain, one consistent finding among cell and animal studies is its effect on lipid oxidation. Several models have shown alterations in lipid oxidation as a result of TBC1D1 deficiency. Specifically, TBC1D1 ablation in vitro and in vivo increases fatty acid oxidation (13Dokas J. Chadt A.

However, the mechanism of action resulting in up-regulated fatty acid oxidation remains unknown. The fatty acid transporter FAT/CD36 has been shown to translocate in response to both insulin and contraction (24Jain S.S. Chabowski A. Snook L.A. Schwenk R.W. Glatz J.F. Luiken J.J. Bonen A.

In vivo, fatty acid translocase (CD36) critically regulates skeletal muscle fuel selection, exercise performance, and training-induced adaptation of fatty acid oxidation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 23502-23516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but whether this occurs via a vesicle-dependent mechanism involving TBC1D1 remains to be determined. Altogether, state-of-the art studies have provided compelling evidence that TBC1D1 ablation impairs glucose uptake and increases fatty acid oxidation. However, the current KO mouse models display a marked reduction in GLUT4 content, which by itself may also convey a similar phenotype (i.e. impaired glucose uptake, greater reliance on fatty acids, and impairment in exercise capacity), making interpretations difficult. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the role of TBC1D1 in a previously unexamined KO rat model that lacks a compensatory reduction in GLUT4 content. Using this model, we provide evidence that TBC1D1 regulates contraction but not insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation in glycolytic muscles and subsequently decreases exercise capacity. These results appear specific to GLUT4 as FAT/CD36 trafficking was not altered. Taken together, these results provide support for a role of TBC1D1 in intracellular GLUT4 trafficking in response to contraction but not insulin stimulation. We first characterized TBC1D1 KO animals to determine whether they displayed phenotypic differences compared with wild-type (WT) animals (Table 1). There were no differences in animal or tissue weights or in heart size normalized to tibial length. TBC1D1 deficiency was confirmed by screening for TBC1D1 protein in skeletal muscle homogenate. KO animals did not express TBC1D1 protein in red or white muscle; however, they had similar levels of AS160, Akt2, and FAT/CD36 (Fig. 1A). We also assessed GLUT4 protein content, which was not different compared with WT rats in red or white muscle (Fig. 1, B and C).Table 1Animal characterization and tissue screen of WT and TBC1D1 KO animalsGenotypeAnimal characteristicWeightSoleusEDLHeartHeart/tibial lengthLiverWATggggg·cm−1ggWT409.80 ± 13.420.195 ± 0.040.170 ± 0.011.09 ± 0.030.249 ± 0.019.48 ± 0.785.89 ± 0.39KO353.80 ± 40.520.167 ± 0.010.155 ± 0.011.10 ± 0.090.254 ± 0.029.69 ± 1.066.34 ± 1.28 Open table in a new tab Given the unaltered GLUT4 content in this KO model and the proposed role of TBC1D1 in glucose homeostasis, we first examined the effect of ablating this protein on glucose handling at the whole-body level.

However, there was no difference between TBC1D1 WT and KO animals during an intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (ITT), suggesting that peripheral insulin sensitivity is intact in this model (Fig. 2, C and D). Consistent with similar whole-body insulin sensitivity, insulin increased the phosphorylation of Akt2 by ∼3-fold in both red and white muscles in both WT and KO animals (Fig. 3, A and B). Total muscle GLUT4 expression and insulin-mediated GLUT4 trafficking in giant sarcolemmal vesicles was also unaltered between genotypes (Fig. 3, C and D).

In the present study and consistent with previous reports in murine models (13Dokas J. Chadt A. Nolden T. Himmelbauer H. Zierath J.R. Joost H.-G. Al-Hasani H.

Genet. 2008; 40: 1354-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), TBC1D1 KO rats displayed a decreased respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and therefore calculated fat oxidation was increased whereas carbohydrate oxidation was concomitantly decreased in both the light and dark cycle (Fig. 4, A–C; p < 0.05). These responses represent a shift in fuel preference as there was no change in total energy expenditure (Fig. 4D). The increase in fatty acid oxidation was also observed in ex vivo experiments in isolated EDL muscle strips. Specifically, palmitate oxidation was increased by 36% (Fig. 4E; p < 0.05). In contrast, there was no change in glucose oxidation (Fig. 4F) in KO animals. Given this alteration in skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation, we next examined whether the KO animals displayed a change in mitochondrial content or respiratory function. TBC1D1 KO animals displayed increased ADP-stimulated oxygen consumption in permeabilized muscle fibers (Fig. 5A; p < 0.05); however, there was no change in lipid-supported respiration (palmitoyl-CoA (P-CoA); Fig. 5A, right y axis). To determine whether this functional increase was due to a change in mitochondrial protein content, we digested the fibers used for oxygen consumption measurements for assessment via Western blotting. Similar to previous work in TBC1D1 KO mice (14Stöckli J. Meoli C.C. Hoffman N.J. Fazakerley D.J. Pant H. Cleasby M.E. Ma X. Kleinert M. Brandon A.E. Lopez J.A. Cooney G.J. James D.E. The RabGAP TBC1D1 plays a central role in exercise-regulated glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle.Diabetes. 2015; 64: 1914-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), mitochondrial content in both digested fibers (Fig. 5B) and muscle homogenate (Fig. 5, C and D) was similar between WT and KO animals. Furthermore, there was no difference in basal β-HAD enzyme activity in white (WT, 5.10 ± 1.04 μmol·min−1·g−1 wet weight; KO, 4.33 ± 0.63 μmol·min−1·g−1 wet weight; n = 6, p = 0.30) or red muscle (WT, 14.56 ± 1.77 μmol·min−1·g−1 wet weight; KO, 13.95 ± 1.37 μmol·min−1·g−1 wet weight; n = 6, p = 0.77) between genotypes. To further examine the effects of ablating TBC1D1 on oxidative phosphorylation, we determined the kinetic properties of ADP to stimulate respiration in the presence of saturating substrates (Fig. 6, A and C). Maximal respiration was higher in KO animals when ADP was titrated both with and without creatine (∼37%, p < 0.05 versus WT; Fig. 6, A and C, respectively); however, this did not alter estimated ADP sensitivity as assessed by the apparent Km (Fig. 6, B and D, respectively). Similarly, maximal respiration in KO animals was also increased (∼30%, p < 0.05) when pyruvate was titrated in the presence of saturating ADP concentrations with no effect on the apparent Km (Fig. 6, E and F).Figure 6Kinetic properties of mitochondria. Shown are ADP titrations in permeabilized fibers prepared from EDL muscle in the presence (A and B) and absence (C and D) of creatine with pyruvate and malate present in the respiration buffer.

(error bars) (n = 8). *, p < 0.05 versus WT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next sought to determine whether the up-regulation of fatty acid oxidation seen at both the whole-body and skeletal muscle levels in KO animals could be explained by altered substrate delivery and/or metabolic inflexibility in response to contraction. Following electrical stimulation, AMPK and ACC were phosphorylated regardless of genotype or muscle (Fig. 7, A and B), confirming successful contraction of the muscles and suggesting that these signaling cascades remained intact in the absence of TBC1D1. We therefore isolated giant sarcolemmal vesicles for the determination of plasma membrane transporters. Although FAT/CD36 increased in red muscle following contraction (Fig. 7C), there was no difference between genotypes and no effect of contraction in either group in white muscle (Fig. 7D). This suggests that the increase in whole-body fatty acid oxidation in KO animals is not due to increased transport into skeletal muscle. We next sought to determine whether there was an impairment in contraction-mediated glucose uptake and GLUT4 trafficking. Electrically induced contraction resulted in a significant increase in 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake in both genotypes in red and white muscles (p < 0.05; Fig. 8, A and B); however, compared with WT, this effect was significantly reduced in KO animals in white muscle (p < 0.05; Fig. 8B). The increase in glucose uptake from basal levels (Δ change) following stimulation was also significantly reduced in white muscle (p < 0.05; Fig. 8A, inset) and tended to be lower in red muscle (p = 0.07; Fig. 8B, inset) of KO animals. These effects were mirrored in sarcolemmal GLUT4 protein content as there was a main effect for contraction to increase GLUT4 in red muscle with a strong trend for a decreased response to contraction in KO animals (p = 0.10; Fig. 8C, inset). In addition, both absolute plasma membrane GLUT4 content and the ability of contraction to stimulate plasma membrane GLUT4 content were lower in white muscle of KO animals following contraction (Fig. 8, D and inset), further suggesting that ablation of TBC1D1 impairs intracellular trafficking and glucose uptake. Given this finding, we analyzed glycogen utilization during contraction to determine whether there was a compensatory increase in endogenous substrate utilization. However, there was no change in glycogen content or in skeletal muscle metabolite production (Table 2) between genotypes following contraction.Figure 82-DG uptake and GLUT4 translocation in response to contraction. 2-DG uptake in red (A) and white (B) gastrocnemius in WT and KO animals (n = 8 for WT and n = 5 for KO) is shown.

Open table in a new tab Given our finding of reduced GLUT4 trafficking and glucose uptake in KO animals in response to contraction and the prominent role of exogenous substrates during contraction in rats, we next examined whether this would result in impaired running performance. Consistent with reductions in glucose uptake in situ, running time decreased in TBC1D1 KO animals by ∼18% at low intensity and ∼25% at the higher intensity (Fig. 9). In this study, we utilized a novel TBC1D1 KO rat model to elucidate the role of this protein in intracellular GLUT4 trafficking. We have shown that, in contrast to the TBC1D1-deficient murine model, there is no decrease in total GLUT4 protein content or impairment in GLUT4 accumulation on the plasma membrane of muscle in response to insulin. These data therefore suggest that TBC1D1 is not required for insulin-mediated GLUT4 trafficking. In contrast, we provide evidence that contraction-mediated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation in KO animals are impaired in TBC1D1 KO animals, and this is associated with compromised exercise capacity. These findings demonstrate that TBC1D1 plays an important role in contraction-mediated but not insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in skeletal muscle. In the current study, we have shown that TBC1D1 ablation results in impaired glucose tolerance, which is consistent with previous reports implicating this protein in maintaining beta cell mass (26Paglialunga S. Simnett G. Robson H. Hoang M. Pillai R. Arkell A.M. Simpson J.A. Bonen A. Huising M. Joseph J.W. Holloway G.P.

Expression, phosphorylation and function of the Rab-GTPase activating protein TBC1D1 in pancreatic β-cells.FEBS Lett. 2014; 588: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the current work also demonstrates that TBC1D1 is not required for intracellular GLUT4 trafficking in response to insulin as there were no differences in ITT or in total or phosphorylated (Ser-473) Akt2 or plasma membrane GLUT4 content. Our findings are supported by previous work showing that mutation of the canonical Akt phosphorylation motif on TBC1D1 (Thr-596) to Ala had no effect on insulin-stimulated glucose transport (28An D. Toyoda T. Taylor E.B. Yu H. Fujii N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. TBC1D1 regulates insulin- and contraction-induced glucose transport in mouse skeletal muscle.Diabetes. 2010; 59: 1358-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We have also shown that total GLUT4 protein is unaltered between WT and KO rats, which is critical to the interpretations of the functional role of TBC1D1. This is in contrast to previous work utilizing TBC1D1-deficient mice that showed impaired insulin-stimulated glucose transport (12Szekeres F. Chadt A. Tom R.Z. Deshmukh A.S. Chibalin A.V. Björnholm M. Al-Hasani H. Zierath J.R. The Rab-GTPase-activating protein TBC1D1 regulates skeletal muscle glucose metabolism.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

Conventional knockout of Tbc1d1 in mice impairs insulin- and AICAR-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle.Endocrinology. 2013; 154: 3502-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, these studies were confounded by an ∼50% reduction in GLUT4 content, thus making it difficult to ascertain the exact role of TBC1D1 in glucose transport. It is therefore possible that the reduced glucose uptake in TBC1D1-deficient mouse models is a consequence of lowered GLUT4 content as opposed to a direct role of TBC1D1 in mediating GLUT4 trafficking. We have shown that ablation of TBC1D1 resulted in an increase in whole-body fat oxidation, which occurred in the absence of any change in energy expenditure. This is consistent with previous studies utilizing TBC1D1-deficient mice (13Dokas J. Chadt A. Nolden T. Himmelbauer H. Zierath J.R. Joost H.-G. Al-Hasani H.

Genet. 2008; 40: 1354-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We have also shown an increase in palmitate oxidation in KO animals in isolated EDL strips; however, there was no change in glucose oxidation between genotypes. This suggests that, in the absence of other substrates, the ability to utilize fatty acids is increased in TBC1D1 KO animals, whereas the basal capacity to oxidize carbohydrate is not impaired. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the change in substrate utilization, we evaluated a proximal step in lipid oxidation, FAT/CD36 trafficking to the plasma membrane. FAT/CD36 has previously been shown to respond to similar metabolic stimuli as GLUT4, including insulin and skeletal muscle contraction (24Jain S.S. Chabowski A. Snook L.A. Schwenk R.W. Glatz J.F. Luiken J.J. Bonen A. Additive effects of insulin and muscle contraction on fatty acid transport and fatty acid transporters, FAT/CD36, FABPpm, FATP1, 4 and 6.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 2294-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and is a key component for the regulation of skeletal muscle fuel selection (25McFarlan J.T. Yoshida Y. Jain S.S. Han X.X. Snook L.A. Lally J. Smith B.K. Glatz J.F. Luiken J.J. Sayer R.A. Tupling A.R. Chabowski A. Holloway G.P. Bonen A. In vivo, fatty acid translocase (CD36) critically regulates skeletal muscle fuel selection, exercise performance, and training-induced adaptation of fatty acid oxidation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 23502-23516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It was therefore possible that TBC1D1 plays an important role in intracellular trafficking of this transporter and that ablation of the TBC1D1 gene would result in a compensatory increase in localization of FAT/CD36 to the plasma membrane. However, there was no difference between KO and WT animals in FAT/CD36 protein content measured in sarcolemmal vesicles at rest (p = 0.45) and following contraction in red or white muscle. This therefore indicates that increases in fatty acid transport cannot explain the shift in fuel selection in these animals. Previous work utilizing TBC1D1 overexpression in mice showed reduced activity of β-HAD concomitant with a decrease in fatty acid oxidation (23Maher A.C. McFarlan J. Lally J. Snook L.A. Bonen A. TBC1D1 reduces palmitate oxidation by inhibiting β-HAD activity in skeletal muscle.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2014; 307: R1115-R1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, neither β-HAD activity nor rates of P-CoA supported mitochondrial respiration were altered in KO rats and therefore cannot explain the observed increase in fatty acid oxidation seen at the whole-body or muscle level. In contrast, TBC1D1 KO animals display increased mitochondrial respiration in the absence of any change in mitochondrial protein content, suggesting improved respiratory function. This cannot be explained by increased sensitivity to substrates as there was no change in the apparent Km for pyruvate or for ADP either in the presence or absence of creatine. It is therefore possible that the increase in mitochondrial function is a compensatory adaptation in response to TBC1D1 ablation; however, further work is required to elucidate the exact mechanism behind this. An increase in maximal mitochondrial respiration supports our finding of increased reliance on fatty acid oxidation and may indicate tighter metabolic control as increased respiration, and therefore ATP production, should result in decreased accumulation of mitochondrial-free ADP, although this remains speculative and requires further examination. Consistent with previous reports, we have shown that run time to exhaustion is impaired in TBC1D1 KO animals (14Stöckli J. Meoli C.C. Hoffman N.J. Fazakerley D.J. Pant H. Cleasby M.E. Ma X. Kleinert M. Brandon A.E. Lopez J.A. Cooney G.J. James D.E. The RabGAP TBC1D1 plays a central role in exercise-regulated glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle.Diabetes. 2015; 64: 1914-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, in the previous study, total GLUT4 protein was decreased, again making it difficult to determine whether the impairment in exercise capacity was due to a decrease in transporter protein content or the ablation of TBC1D1. In the current study, we have shown that total GLUT4 protein content was not reduced in the KO animals, and therefore the exercise impairment is likely a result of decreased contraction-mediated GLUT4 trafficking and therefore decreased glucose uptake. This clearly highlights TBC1D1 as having a critical role in glucose homeostasis during exercise, especially given the increased reliance on exogenous glucose as a fuel source in rodents. Interestingly, the decrease in contraction-mediated glucose uptake and plasma membrane GLUT4 content did not result in increased intramuscular glycogen breakdown or an increase in cellular energy perturbation as measured by metabolite accumulation. This suggests that despite the apparent improvement in mitochondrial respiratory function TBC1D1 KO animals are not able to adequately compensate for the decrease in glucose uptake to rescue exercise capacity. Altogether, we have shown that TBC1D1 KO rats displayed increased mitochondrial respiratory function, which may explain the increase in fatty acid oxidation seen both ex vivo and at the whole-body level. Despite these alterations, KO animals displayed decreased exercise capacity likely due to the decrease in GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake seen following contraction. Combined with the findings that TBC1D1 expression is highly specific to skeletal muscle (11Chavez J.A. Roach W.G. Keller S.R. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E.

https://openalex.org/W2750155658,"Shallow water zooxanthellate coral reefs grade into ecologically distinct mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) deeper in the euphotic zone. MCEs are widely considered to start at an absolute depth limit of 30m deep, possibly failing to recognise that these are distinct ecological communities that may shift shallower or deeper depending on local environmental conditions. This study aimed to explore whether MCEs represent distinct biological communities, the upper boundary of which can be defined and whether the depth at which they occur may vary above or below 30m. Mixed-gas diving and closed-circuit rebreathers were used to quantitatively survey benthic communities across shallow to mesophotic reef gradients around the island of Utila, Honduras. Depths of up to 85m were sampled, covering the vertical range of the zooxanthellate corals around Utila. We investigate vertical reef zonation using a variety of ecological metrics to identify community shifts with depth, and the appropriateness of different metrics to define the upper MCE boundary. Patterns observed in scleractinian community composition varied between ordination analyses and approaches utilising biodiversity indices. Indices and richness approaches revealed vertical community transition was a gradation. Ordination approaches suggest the possibility of recognising two scleractinian assemblages. We could detect a mesophotic and shallow community while illustrating that belief in a static depth limit is biologically unjustified. The switch between these two communities occurred across bathymetric gradients as small as 10m and as large as 50m in depth. The difference between communities appears to be a loss of shallow specialists and increase in depth-generalist taxa. Therefore, it may be possible to define MCEs by a loss of shallow specialist species. To support a biological definition of mesophotic reefs, we advocate this analytical framework should be applied around the Caribbean and extended into other ocean basins where MCEs are present."
https://openalex.org/W2745981887,"Background Previous studies revealed that chronic exposure to air pollution can significantly increase the risk of the development of Parkinson’s disease (PD), but this relationship is inconclusive as large-scale prospective studies are limited and the results are inconsistent. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to ascertain the adverse health effects of air pollution exposure in a nationwide population using a longitudinal approach. Materials and methods We conducted a nested case-control study using the National Health Insurance Research Dataset (NHIRD), which consisted of 1,000,000 beneficiaries in the National Health Insurance Program (NHI) in the year 2000 and their medical records from 1995 to 2013 and using public data on air pollution concentrations from monitoring stations across Taiwan released from the Environmental Protection Administration to identify people with ages ≥ 40 years living in areas with monitoring stations during 1995–1999 as study subjects. Then, we excluded subjects with PD, dementia, stroke and diabetes diagnosed before Jan. 1, 2000 and obtained 54,524 subjects to follow until Dec. 31, 2013. In this observational period, 1060 newly diagnosed PD cases were identified. 4240 controls were randomly selected from those without PD using a matching strategy for age, sex, the year of PD diagnosis and the year of entering the NHI program at a ratio of 1:4. Ten elements of air pollution were examined, and multiple logistic regression models were used to measure their risks in subsequent PD development. Results The incidence of PD in adults aged ≥ 40 years was 1.9%, and the median duration for disease onset was 8.45 years. None of the chemical compounds (SO2, O3, CO, NOx, NO, NO2, THC, CH4, or NMHC) significantly affected the incidence of PD except for particulate matter. PM10 exposure showed significant effects on the likelihood of PD development (T3 level: > 65μg/m3 versus T1 level: ≤ 54μg/m3; OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.12–1.62, 0.001 ≤ P < 0.01). In addition, comorbid conditions such as dementia (ORs = 3.53–3.93, Ps < 0.001), stroke (ORs = 2.99–3.01, Ps < 0.001), depression (ORs = 2.51–2.64, Ps < 0.001), head injury (ORs = 1.24–1.29, 0.001 ≤ Ps < 0.01 or 0.01 ≤ Ps < 0.05), sleep disorder (OR = 1.23–1.26, 0.001 ≤ Ps < 0.01), and hypertension (ORs = 1.18–1.19, 0.01 ≤ Ps < 0.05) also significantly increased the risk for PD development. Conclusions Although PM10 plays a significant role in PD development, the associated chemical/metal compounds that are capable of inducing adverse biological mechanisms still warrant further exploration. Because of a link between comorbid conditions and PM exposure, research on the causal relationship between long-term exposure to PM and the development of PD should be considered with caution because other possible modifiers or mediators, comorbid diseases in particular, may be involved."

In addition, one group of rats was given continuous access to L-arginine supplementation (2% in distilled water) for the 5 days before and the 5 days of REM sleep deprivation to reverse sleep deprivation-induced pathological changes. The results showed that REM sleep deprivation decreased body weight, increased blood pressure, and impaired endothelial function of the aortas in middle-aged rats but not young rats. Moreover, nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentrations as well as endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation in the aorta were decreased by REM sleep deprivation. Supplementation with L-arginine could protect against REM sleep deprivation-induced hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, and damage to the eNOS/NO/cGMP signaling pathway. The results of the present study suggested that REM sleep deprivation caused endothelial dysfunction and hypertension in middle-aged rats via the eNOS/NO/cGMP pathway and that these pathological changes could be inhibited via L-arginine supplementation. The present study provides a new strategy to inhibit the signaling pathways involved in insomnia-induced or insomnia-enhanced cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2746897693,"GPR116 (ADGRF5) and ELTD1 (ADGRL4) belong to different subfamilies of the adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor group but are both expressed in endothelial cells. We therefore analyzed their functions in mice lacking these receptors. While loss of GPR116 or ELTD1 alone had no obvious effect on cardiovascular or kidney function, mice lacking both, GPR116 and ELTD1, showed malformations of the aortic arch arteries and the cardiac outflow tract leading to perinatal lethality in about 50% of the mutants. In addition to cardiovascular malformations, surviving mice developed renal thrombotic microangiopathy as well as hemolysis and splenomegaly, and their lifespan was significantly reduced. Loss of GPR116 and ELTD1 specifically in endothelial cells or neural crest-derived cells did not recapitulate any of the phenotypes observed in GPR116-ELTD1 double deficient mice, indicating that loss of GPR116 and ELTD1 expressed by other cells accounts for the observed cardiovascular and renal defects."
https://openalex.org/W2750387625,"One of the most characteristic and abundant amphibian taxa of South American temperate forests is Eupsophus. The ten currently recognized species of the genus have been divided in two species groups, roseus and vertebralis, but most of them, eight, belong to the roseus group. Recent phylogeographic and phylogenetic studies have suggested that species diversity of the roseus group could be underestimated. An examination of the literature shows that species of the roseus group exhibit high levels of variation in their external characteristics, particularly those used as diagnostic characters, which compromises their taxonomy and hinders their field recognition. High levels of variation were also observed in several new populations of the roseus group discovered in southern Chile (36°-40°S), which could not be identified to the species level by their external characteristics. On the other hand, the literature reveals a scarse karyotype differentiation and a high bioacoustic uniformity among the species of the roseus group. We performed a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear genes to reevaluate the species diversity of the roseus group, including all the nominal species of Eupsophus and new populations. This analysis was complemented with three species delimitation approaches, General Mixed Yule Coalescent, multi-rate Poisson Tree Process and Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery. We favored a conservative delimitation of only four species for the roseus group, a result more consistent with the distribution of pairwise genetic distances, and the available chromosome and bioacoustic evidence. The four recognized lineages, which have nearly completely allopatric distributions, are named after the earliest nominal species that they include, but because high levels of phenotypic variation, they are not diagnosable by consistent differences in external morphology. We discuss the implications of this new proposal for the taxonomy and conservation of the genus, and the possible causes of the difficulty to estimate its species diversity."

Reductions in Abcb10 levels have been shown to reduce mitoferrin1 protein levels and iron import into mitochondria, resulting in reduced heme biosynthesis. As an ABC transporter, Abcb10 binds and hydrolyzes ATP, but its transported substrate is unknown. Here, we determined that decreases in Abcb10 did not result in protoporphyrin IX accumulation in morphant-treated zebrafish embryos or in differentiated Abcb10-specific shRNA murine Friend erythroleukemia (MEL) cells in which Abcb10 was specifically silenced with shRNA. We also found that the ATPase activity of Abcb10 is necessary for hemoglobinization in MEL cells, suggesting that the substrate transported by Abcb10 is important in mediating increased heme biosynthesis during erythroid development. Inhibition of 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.24) with succinylacetone resulted in both 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) accumulation in control and Abcb10-specific shRNA MEL cells, demonstrating that reductions in Abcb10 do not affect ALA export from mitochondria and indicating that Abcb10 does not transport ALA. Abcb10 silencing resulted in an alteration in the heme biosynthesis transcriptional profile due to repression by the transcriptional regulator Bach1, which could be partially rescued by overexpression of Alas2 or Gata1, providing a mechanistic explanation for why Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells exhibit reduced hemoglobinization.

They bind and hydrolyze ATP to translocate substrates across membranes and are involved in many biological processes. Several ABC transporters (Abcb6, Abcb7, Abcb8, and Abcb10) are localized to mitochondria and are involved in iron- and/or heme-related biological pathways (1Zutz A. Gompf S. Schägger H. Tampé R. Mitochondrial ABC proteins in health and disease.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1787: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Heme is an essential co-factor and is involved in biological processes, including oxidative phosphorylation, oxygen transport (hemoglobin), metabolism, and detoxification (cytochromes P450). During erythropoiesis, heme biosynthesis increases and is concomitantly coordinated with iron uptake and globin synthesis through transcriptional regulators Gata1 and Bach1 (2Tahara T. Sun J.

Characterization of the role of Abcb10 in erythropoiesis has determined that Abcb10 stabilizes mitoferrin1 (Mfrn1) and forms a complex with ferrochelatase (Fech) to enhance heme synthesis (11Chen W. Dailey H.A. Paw B.H.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16263-16268Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This interaction correlates with increased iron uptake into the mitochondria during hemoglobinization. It is interesting to note that Abcb10 is also expressed in other tissues, suggesting a role independent of erythroid differentiation. In support of this hypothesis, Abcb10 has been shown to have a protective effect against reactive oxygen species and plays a role in heme synthesis in cardiac cells (13Bayeva M. Khechaduri A. Wu R. Burke M.A. Wasserstrom J.A. Singh N. Liesa M. Shirihai O.S. Langer N.B. Paw B.H. Ardehali H. ATP-binding cassette B10 regulates early steps of heme synthesis.Circ. Res. 2013; 113: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). siRNA-mediated reductions in Abcb10 in cardiomyocytes showed decreased mitochondrial heme and decreased enzyme activity for heme-containing proteins but no accumulation of the heme precursor protoporphyrin IX (PPIX). Further, Bayeva et al. (13Bayeva M. Khechaduri A. Wu R. Burke M.A. Wasserstrom J.A. Singh N. Liesa M. Shirihai O.S. Langer N.B. Paw B.H. Ardehali H. ATP-binding cassette B10 regulates early steps of heme synthesis.Circ. Res. 2013; 113: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) showed that the addition of exogenous δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), the rate-limiting product in heme biosynthesis, to Friend murine erythroleukemic (MEL) cells rescued the heme defect associated with reductions in Abcb10 protein. Contrasting results were observed in a mouse hematopoietic-specific deletion of Abcb10, where PPIX accumulation was observed (14Yamamoto M. Arimura H. Fukushige T. Minami K. Nishizawa Y. Tanimoto A. Kanekura T. Nakagawa M. Akiyama S. Furukawa T. Abcb10 role in heme biosynthesis in vivo: Abcb10 knockout in mice causes anemia with protoporphyrin IX and iron accumulation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2014; 34: 1077-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). More recently, Qiu et al. (15Qiu W. Liesa M. Carpenter E.P. Shirihai O.S. ATP binding and hydrolysis properties of ABCB10 and their regulation by glutathione.PLoS One. 2015; 10: e0129772Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) have reported that Abcb10 does not play a role in ALA export from mitochondria. Because of these conflicting results, we examined the role of Abcb10 using the model organism Danio rerio and cultured murine MEL cells. We show that Abcb10 has a function in hemoglobinization independent of Mfrn1 and is not an ALA exporter. We observed significant down-regulation of the erythropoiesis transcriptional program in the absence of Abcb10, which can be ascribed to increased Bach1 occupancy on the β-Globin promoter. We utilized the D. rerio (zebrafish) model system for red blood cell development to determine whether the loss of abcb10 resulted in changes in PPIX, intermediate porphyrins, or heme. We employed morpholinos in the Tg(globin-LCR:eGFP) transgenic line of zebrafish, which expresses GFP under the globin locus control region (LCR) enhancer (16Ganis J.J. Hsia N.

Zebrafish globin switching occurs in two developmental stages and is controlled by the LCR.Dev. Biol. 2012; 366: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and o-dianosidine staining to assess hemoglobinization and flow cytometry to assess changes in GFP+ red cell mass. Two different splice donor morpholinos (MOe2 and MOe3) were used, which are predicted to disrupt abcb10 mRNA formation. Embryos showed reductions in hemoglobinization with either abcb10-specific morpholino at 72 h postfertilization (hpf) (Fig. 1A). Flow cytometric analysis of GFP-positive cells showed marked reductions in erythrocytes (GFP-positive cells) compared with the uninjected controls (Fig. 1B). That both morpholinos gave rise to similar phenotypes and normal β-actin mRNA processing suggests that this is not an off-target or toxic effect of the morpholinos. Reductions of abcb10 mRNA in embryos was confirmed by PCR using primers spanning Abcb10 exon–intron junctions (Fig. 1C). To confirm that the anemia resulted from a defect of heme production, heme and porphyrin levels were measured by HPLC in embryos at 72 hpf (Table 1). Morpholinos against uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase d (urod) and ferrochelatase (fech), the enzymes that catalyze the fifth and the last step of the heme biosynthetic pathway, respectively, were used as controls. Heme levels were severely decreased in both abcb10 morphants compared with the uninjected controls. As expected, heme levels were decreased in both urod and fech morpholino-treated embryos. Intermediate porphyrins accumulated in urod morphant-treated embryos and PPIX accumulated in fech morphant-treated embryos. In contrast, both abcb10 morphant-treated embryos (MO2 and MO3) did not accumulate either intermediate porphyrins or PPIX. The absence of abcb10 resulted in decreased heme levels with no accumulation of PPIX. These results are in agreement with previous studies in cardiac myocytes (13Bayeva M. Khechaduri A. Wu R.

We confirmed by qRT-PCR that Abcb10 mRNA levels were reduced (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis showed reduced Abcb10 levels in differentiated MEL cells (Fig. 2B). Further, reductions in Abcb10 resulted in decreased levels of Mfrn1 as Abcb10 has been shown to interact with and stabilize Mfrn1 during red cell differentiation (11Chen W. Dailey H.A. Paw B.H.

Abcb10 shRNA cells showed a delay in hemoglobinization as well as reduced amounts of hemoglobin in the majority of cells as assessed by o-dianisidine staining (Fig. 2C). As the MEL cell experiments are completely independent of the zebrafish experiments, these results validate the observations seen with morpholinos in zebrafish embryos. We utilized our Abcb10-specific shRNA MEL cells to examine mitochondrial iron uptake and iron incorporation into heme. Abcb10-specific shRNA MEL cells showed increased iron uptake into mitochondria (Fig. 3A) but reduced iron incorporation into heme (Fig. 3B). This suggests that there may be a defect in iron loading into the PPIX molecule. Iron incorporation into the PPIX molecule to generate heme requires the activity of the iron–sulfur (Fe-S) cluster protein Fech. Perhaps reductions in Abcb10 affect iron–sulfur cluster formation. We measured the activity of Fech (Fig. 3C), aconitase (Fig. 3D), and xanthine oxidase (Fig. 3E). Only xanthine oxidase showed a significant reduction in activity without a change in protein levels. These results demonstrate that the absence of Abcb10 does not affect mitochondrial Fe-S cluster proteins but does affect a cytosolic Fe-S cluster protein. Importantly, there was no increase in the levels of PPIX in Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells (Fig. 3F). Together, these results suggest that the absence of Abcb10 affects an early step in heme synthesis. To determine whether the ATPase activity of Abcb10 is necessary for hemoglobinization, we generated plasmids containing either wild-type human Abcb10-GFP or human Abcb10-GFP with a mutated Walker A (K533E), Walker B (D658A/E659A) or signature (S635R/Q638H) motif as these motifs are responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis (15Qiu W. Liesa M. Carpenter E.P. Shirihai O.S.

ABC transporters: a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 520-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These constructs were transfected in Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells, and cells were differentiated for 3 days. All constructs were expressed and localized to mitochondria (supplemental Fig. 1). Western analysis showed that the ATP binding function of Abcb10 was not necessary for the stabilization of Mfrn1 (Fig. 4A). Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells expressing wild-type or Walker A mutant human Abcb10 showed increased hemoglobinization compared with Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells expressing control GFP, whereas Walker B and signature motif mutants were not able to rescue the hemoglobinization defect associated with loss of Abcb10 (Fig. 4B) or heme synthesis (Fig. 4C). These results demonstrate that ATP hydrolysis and subsequent substrate transport are necessary for hemoglobinization of MEL cells and suggest that Abcb10 has an additional role in heme synthesis besides the stabilization of Mfrn1. To identify the site in the heme synthesis pathway that is disrupted by reductions in Abcb10, we fed cells [14C]glycine. Glycine and succinyl-CoA are the substrates for the rate-limiting step in heme synthesis, production of ALA. This step requires the enzyme 5′-aminolevulinate synthase 2 acid synthase 2 (Alas2) in red cells. Extracting 14C-heme and 14C-porphyrins provides a measure of Alas2 activity. Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells showed a marked reduction in 14C-heme compared with nonspecific shRNA control MEL cells (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that there is a defect in ALA synthesis. Because iron uptake into mitochondria is not limited in the Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells, we examined the mRNA levels of heme biosynthesis genes. As expected, heme biosynthesis genes are up-regulated in differentiated control cells as well as Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells, but the -fold increase in β-Globin, Alas2, and Fech was markedly reduced in Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells (Fig. 5B). Fech activity was not reduced in Abcb10 shRNA MEL (see Fig. 2C), but Alas2 protein levels were greatly reduced, suggesting reduced Alas2 activity. Heme biosynthesis transcripts for Pgbd, UroD, and Ppox were also significantly reduced even in undifferentiated Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells (supplemental Fig. 2A). Further, genes involved in erythroid differentiation (TfR1 and Bcl-xl) showed reduced transcripts, suggesting that the “tone” for erythroid differentiation is altered by reductions in Abcb10 levels. These reductions in transcripts are specific to the genes in the erythroid differentiation pathway because both heavy and light chain ferritin (Fth and Ftl) and superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2) are unaffected in Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells (supplemental Fig. 2B). We confirmed that the hemoglobinization and transcript profile of Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells could be rescued by overexpression of human Abcb10 (Fig. 5C). That the overexpression of human Abcb10 did not fully complement transcripts back to control cell levels can be attributed to decreased efficiency of transduction in Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells compared with control shRNA MEL cells (supplemental Fig. 3). It has been proposed that Abcb10 is involved in the export of ALA from mitochondria to the cytosol, since the addition of ALA rescues defects in cardiomyocytes (13Bayeva M. Khechaduri A. Wu R. Burke M.A. Wasserstrom J.A. Singh N. Liesa M. Shirihai O.S. Langer N.B. Paw B.H. Ardehali H. ATP-binding cassette B10 regulates early steps of heme synthesis.Circ. Res. 2013; 113: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To see whether ALA could rescue the hemoglobinization defect in Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells, ALA was added during differentiation. As shown in Fig. 5D, hemoglobinization was rescued in Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells by the addition of ALA. We noted that the levels of hemoglobinization were increased even in undifferentiated control cells grown with ALA. Similarly, Bayeva et al. (13Bayeva M. Khechaduri A. Wu R. Burke M.A. Wasserstrom J.A. Singh N. Liesa M. Shirihai O.S. Langer N.B. Paw B.H. Ardehali H. ATP-binding cassette B10 regulates early steps of heme synthesis.Circ. Res. 2013; 113: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) also saw increased mitochondrial heme levels in ALA-treated control cells, demonstrating that the presence of excess ALA affects heme accumulation independent of the presence of Abcb10. We examined whether the addition of ALA rescued the expression levels of heme biosynthesis genes. The addition of ALA to control cells slightly reduced the levels of Alas2, whereas β-Globin and Fech levels remained the same (Fig. 5E). The addition of ALA to Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells resulted in decreased Alas2 and Fech mRNA but did not increase of β-Globin transcripts. That β-Globin levels were still low in ALA-treated Abcb10 shRNA cells suggests that there may be a block in the ability to increase β-Globin transcription. To further rule out the possibility that Abcb10 is an ALA exporter, we incubated cells with succinylacetone (SA), an inhibitor of the cytosolic enzyme ALA dehydratase, the second enzyme of the heme biosynthesis pathway that catalyzes the condensation of ALA to form porphobilinogen (21Ebert P.S. Hess R.A. Frykholm B.C. Tschudy D.P.

Effect of heme depletion on growth, protein synthesis and respiration of murine erythroleukemia cells.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1980; 29: 1825-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). If Abcb10 is involved in the export of ALA, we would not expect to see an accumulation of ALA in Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells. Cells were differentiated for 3 days and incubated with SA for 3 h. ALA levels and Alas2 activity were measured. As expected, ALA levels increased by ∼100-fold in SA-treated differentiated control MEL cells but also increased 100-fold in Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells (Fig. 6A), demonstrating that ALA is exiting the mitochondria even in the absence of Abcb10. The levels of ALA, however, were reduced in Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells compared with control cells. Further, Alas2 activity was decreased by ∼2-fold in Abcb10 knockdown cells compared with control shRNA MEL cells (Fig. 6B), which confirms the reduced protein and transcript levels seen in Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells. As ALA did accumulate in SA-treated Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells, these experiments strongly suggest that Abcb10 does not play a role in ALA export from mitochondria. Further, the addition of SA did not alter Alas2 or β-Globin mRNA levels (supplemental Fig. 4). These results confirm those reported by the Shiriai group (15Qiu W. Liesa M. Carpenter E.P. Shirihai O.S. ATP binding and hydrolysis properties of ABCB10 and their regulation by glutathione.PLoS One. 2015; 10: e0129772Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which indicated that Abcb10 is not involved in the export of ALA from mitochondria. We also utilized the in vivo zebrafish model expressing GFP under the globin LCR enhancer as in Fig. 1C, where we could reduce the levels Abcb10 or Alas2, the rate-limiting enzyme in ALA synthesis. Treatment of zebrafish embryos with 2 mm ALA rescued hemogloblinization of alas2 morphants but did not rescue abcb10 morphants (Fig. 6C). That ALA did not rescue abcb10 morphants or change β-Globin transcript levels in Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells suggests that the levels of heme are insufficient to permit increased β-Globin expression. The addition of hemin to growth media increased β-Globin mRNA levels in control shRNA MEL cells; however, there were no significant changes in Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells (supplemental Fig. 5). Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) transcripts were only slightly increased in control and Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells. One possible explanation for this result is that MEL cells do not take up hemin well. We also tested whether the Alas2 cofactor pyridoxal 5′-phosphate was rate-limiting for ALA synthesis in Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells. The addition of pyridoxine or pyridoxal hydrochloride did not result in increased hemoglobinization of Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells (data not shown). The defect of hemoglobinization in Abcb10 knockdown cells could be due to the defect in Alas2, which is required to fully induce the hemoglobinization transcription program (5Tanimura N. Miller E. Igarashi K. Yang D. Burstyn J.N. Dewey C.N. Bresnick E.H. Mechanism governing heme synthesis reveals a GATA factor/heme circuit that controls differentiation.EMBO Rep. 2016; 17: 249-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We therefore overexpressed human Alas2 in control and Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells and measured hemoglobinization and heme biosynthesis transcripts. Overexpression of human Alas2 increased hemoglobinization in Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells (Fig. 6D) and a 2-fold increase in endogenous mouse Alas2 transcripts (Fig. 6E), suggesting that there might be a repression of mouse Alas2 expression in the absence of Abcb10 that can be partially rescued by overexpression of human Alas2. The transcription factor Gata1 is needed for proper erythropoiesis and is known to induce key erythroid genes during terminal differentiation, while simultaneously repressing non-erythroid genes (3Welch J.J. Watts J.A. Vakoc C.R. Yao Y. Wang H. Hardison R.C. Blobel G.A. Chodosh L.A. Weiss M.J. Global regulation of erythroid gene expression by transcription factor GATA-1.Blood. 2004; 104: 3136-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism for reduced heme biosynthesis transcripts in Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells, we measured the Gata1 occupancy of β-Globin and Alas2 in undifferentiated and differentiated control and Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells. We examined both the LCR DNase I hypersensitive site (HS) HS2 and HS3 regions and the proximal region (Globin promoter) of the β-Globin promoter (23Noordermeer D. de Laat W. Joining the loops: β-globin gene regulation.IUBMB Life. 2008; 60: 824-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). ChIP analysis revealed no changes in promoter occupancy in undifferentiated Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells compared with control shRNA MEL cells, whereas in differentiated cells, there was less Gata1 present on the HS2 region and the proximal region of the β-Globin promoter and less Gata1 on the Alas2 promoter in Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells (Fig. 7A). We examined the levels of transcripts of several transcription factors involved in erythropoiesis. Gata1, Gata2, and Bach1 transcript levels were unchanged in differentiated Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells (Fig. 7B), and there were no changes in Gata1 or Bach1 protein compared with control MEL cells (Fig. 7C). These results show that Gata1 protein levels are similar in control shRNA and Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells but Gata1 is unable to occupy the β-Globin and Alas2 promoters efficiently in the absence of Abcb10. Overexpression of mouse Gata1 partially rescued the hemoglobinization defect and hemoglobinization transcripts in differentiated Abcb10 shRNA MEL cells (Fig. 7D). We note that the rescued hemoglobinization in Gata1 overexpression w"

Materials and methods An eight compartment, physical anthropomorphic head phantom was developed from a 3T MRI dataset of a healthy male. The designed phantom was successfully built and preliminarily evaluated through an application that involves electromagnetic-tissue interactions: MRI (due to it being an available resource). The developed phantom was filled with media possessing electromagnetic constitutive parameters that correspond to biological tissues at ~297 MHz. A preliminary comparison between an in-vivo human volunteer (based on whom the anthropomorphic head phantom was created) and various phantoms types, one being the anthropomorphic heterogeneous head phantom, were performed using a 7 Tesla human MRI scanner. Results Echo planar imaging was performed and minimal ghosting and fluctuations were observed using the proposed anthropomorphic phantom. The magnetic field distributions (during MRI experiments at 7 Tesla) and the scattering parameter (measured using a network analyzer) were most comparable between the anthropomorphic heterogeneous head phantom and an in-vivo human volunteer. Conclusion The developed anthropomorphic heterogeneous head phantom can be used as a resource to various researchers in applications that involve electromagnetic-biological tissue interactions such as MRI."
https://openalex.org/W2746875695,"Extreme heat events will become more frequent under anthropogenic climate change, especially in Mediterranean ecosystems. Microhabitats can considerably moderate (buffer) the effects of extreme weather events and hence facilitate the persistence of some components of the biodiversity. We investigate the microclimatic moderation provided by two important microhabitats (cavities formed by the leaves of the grass-tree Xanthorrhoea semiplana F.Muell., Xanthorrhoeaceae; and inside the leaf-litter) during the summer of 2015/16 on the Fleurieu Peninsula of South Australia. We placed microsensors inside and outside these microhabitats, as well as above the ground below the forest canopy. Grass-tree and leaf-litter microhabitats significantly buffered against high temperatures and low relative humidity, compared to ground-below-canopy sensors. There was no significant difference between grass-tree and leaf-litter temperatures: in both microhabitats, daily temperature variation was reduced, day temperatures were 1–5°C cooler, night temperatures were 0.5–3°C warmer, and maximum temperatures were up to 14.4°C lower, compared to ground-below-canopy sensors. Grass-tree and leaf-litter microhabitats moderated heat increase at an average rate of 0.24°C temperature per 1°C increase of ambient temperature in the ground-below-canopy microhabitat. The average daily variation in temperature was determined by the type (grass-tree and leaf-litter versus ground-below-canopy) of microhabitat (explaining 67%), the amount of canopy cover and the area of the vegetation fragment (together explaining almost 10% of the variation). Greater canopy cover increased the amount of microclimatic moderation provided, especially in the leaf-litter. Our study highlights the importance of microhabitats in moderating macroclimatic conditions. However, this moderating effect is currently not considered in species distribution modelling under anthropogenic climate change nor in the management of vegetation. This shortcoming will have to be addressed to obtain realistic forecasts of future species distributions and to achieve effective management of biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W2749335473,"Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα)+ cells are distributed into distinct morphological groups within the serosal, muscular, and submucosal layers as well as the myenteric and deep muscular plexi. PDGFRα+ cells directly interact with interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and smooth muscle cells (SMC) in gastrointestinal smooth muscle tissue. These three cell types, SMC, ICC, and PDGFRα+ cells (SIP cells), form an electrical syncytium, which dynamically regulates gastrointestinal motility. We have previously reported the transcriptomes of SMC and ICC. To complete the SIP cell transcriptome project, we obtained transcriptome data from jejunal and colonic PDGFRα+ cells. The PDGFRα+ cell transcriptome data were added to the Smooth Muscle Genome Browser that we previously built for the genome-scale gene expression data of ICC and SMC. This browser provides a comprehensive reference for all transcripts expressed in SIP cells. By analyzing the transcriptomes, we have identified a unique set of PDGFRα+ cell signature genes, growth factors, transcription factors, epigenetic enzymes/regulators, receptors, protein kinases/phosphatases, and ion channels/transporters. We demonstrated that the low voltage-dependent T-type Ca2+ channel Cacna1g gene was particularly expressed in PDGFRα+ cells in the intestinal serosal layer in mice. Expression of this gene was significantly induced in the hyperplasic PDGFRα+ cells of obstructed small intestine in mice. This gene was also over-expressed in colorectal cancer, Crohn's disease, and diverticulitis in human patients. Taken together, our data suggest that Cacna1g exclusively expressed in serosal PDGFRα+ cells is a new pathological marker for gastrointestinal diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2745869448,"Impaired balance is common post stroke and can be assessed by means of force-platforms measuring center of pressure (COP) displacements during static standing, or more dynamically during lateral maximum weight shift (MWS). However, activities of daily life also include diagonal MWS and since force platforms are nowadays commercially available, investigating lateral and diagonal MWS in a clinical setting might be feasible and clinically relevant. We investigated lateral and diagonal MWS while standing in patients with stroke (PwS) and healthy controls (HC), evaluated MWS towards the affected and the non-affected side for PwS and correlated MWS with measures of balance, gait and fear of falling. In a cross-sectional observational study including 36 ambulatory sub-acute inpatients and 32 age-matched HC, a force platform (BioRescue, RM Ingénierie, France) was used to measure lateral and diagonal MWS in standing. Clinical outcome measures collected were Berg Balance Scale and Community Balance and Mobility Scale (CBMS) for balance, 10-meter walk test (10MWT) for gait speed and Falls Efficacy Scale-international version for fear of falling. MWS for PwS towards the affected side was significantly smaller compared to HC (lateral: p = 0.029; diagonal-forward: p = 0.000). MWS for PwS was also significantly reduced towards the affected side in the diagonal-forward direction (p = 0.019) compared to the non-affected side of PwS. Strong correlations were found for MWS for PwS in the diagonal-forward direction towards the affected side, and clinical measures of balance (CBMS: r = 0.66) and gait speed (10MWT: r = 0.66). Our study showed that ambulatory sub-acute PwS, in comparison to HC, have decreased ability to shift their body weight diagonally forward in standing towards their affected side. This reduced ability is strongly related to clinical measures of balance and gait speed. Our results suggest that MWS in a diagonal-forward direction should receive attention in rehabilitation of ambulatory sub-acute PwS in an inpatient setting."
https://openalex.org/W2749476971,"Sexual selection is an intense evolutionary force, which operates through competition for the access to breeding resources. There are many cases where male copulatory success is highly asymmetric, and few males are able to sire most females. Two main hypotheses were proposed to explain this asymmetry: “female choice” and “male dominance”. The literature reports contrasting results. This variability may reflect actual differences among studied populations, but it may also be generated by methodological differences and statistical shortcomings in data analysis. A review of the statistical methods used so far in lek studies, shows a prevalence of Linear Models (LM) and Generalized Linear Models (GLM) which may be affected by problems in inferring cause-effect relationships; multi-collinearity among explanatory variables and erroneous handling of non-normal and non-continuous distributions of the response variable. In lek breeding, selective pressure is maximal, because large numbers of males and females congregate in small arenas. We used a dataset on lekking fallow deer (Dama dama), to contrast the methods and procedures employed so far, and we propose a novel approach based on Generalized Structural Equations Models (GSEMs). GSEMs combine the power and flexibility of both SEM and GLM in a unified modeling framework. We showed that LMs fail to identify several important predictors of male copulatory success and yields very imprecise parameter estimates. Minor variations in data transformation yield wide changes in results and the method appears unreliable. GLMs improved the analysis, but GSEMs provided better results, because the use of latent variables decreases the impact of measurement errors. Using GSEMs, we were able to test contrasting hypotheses and calculate both direct and indirect effects, and we reached a high precision of the estimates, which implies a high predictive ability. In synthesis, we recommend the use of GSEMs in studies on lekking behaviour, and we provide guidelines to implement these models."
https://openalex.org/W2746118712,"Rickettsial infections continue to cause serious morbidity and mortality in severe human cases around the world. Host cell adhesion and invasion is an essential requisite for intracellular growth, replication, and subsequent dissemination of pathogenic rickettsiae. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans [HSPGs] facilitate the interactions between fibroblast growth factor(s) and their tyrosine kinase receptors resulting in receptor dimerization/activation and have been implicated in bacterial adhesion to target host cells. In the present study, we have investigated the contributions of fibroblast growth factor receptors [FGFRs] in rickettsial entry into the host cells. Inhibition of HSPGs by heparinase and FGFRs by AZD4547 (a selective small-molecule inhibitor) results in significant reduction in rickettsial internalization into cultured human microvascular endothelial cells (ECs), which represent the primary targets of pathogenic rickettsiae during human infections. Administration of AZD4547 during R. conorii infection in a murine model of endothelial-target spotted fever rickettsiosis also diminishes pulmonary rickettsial burden in comparison to mock-treated controls. Silencing of FGFR1 expression using a small interfering RNA also leads to similar inhibition of R. rickettsii invasion into ECs. Consistent with these findings, R. rickettsii infection of ECs also results in phosphorylation of tyrosine 653/654, suggesting activation of FGFR1. Using isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation [iTRAQ]-based proteomics approach, we further demonstrate association of β-peptide of rickettsial outer membrane protein OmpA with FGFR1. Mechanistically, FGFR1 binds to caveolin-1 and mediates bacterial entry via caveolin-1 dependent endocytosis. Together, these results identify host cell FGFR1 and rickettsial OmpA as another novel receptor-ligand pair contributing to the internalization of pathogenic rickettsiae into host endothelial cells and the potential application of FGFR-inhibitor drugs as adjunct therapeutics against spotted fever rickettsioses."
https://openalex.org/W2746983757,"The creatine kinase (CK) phosphagen system is fundamental to cellular energy homeostasis. Cardiomyocytes express three CK isoforms, namely the mitochondrial sarcomeric CKMT2 and the cytoplasmic CKM and CKB. We hypothesized that augmenting CK in vitro would preserve cell viability and function and sought to determine efficacy of the various isoforms. The open reading frame of each isoform was cloned into pcDNA3.1, followed by transfection and stable selection in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293). CKMT2- CKM- and CKB-HEK293 cells had increased protein and total CK activity compared to non-transfected cells. Overexpressing any of the three CK isoforms reduced cell death in response to 18h hypoxia at 1% O2 followed by 2h re-oxygenation as assayed using propidium iodide: by 33% in CKMT2, 47% in CKM and 58% in CKB compared to non-transfected cells (P<0.05). Loading cells with creatine did not modify cell survival. Transient expression of CK isoforms in HL-1 cardiac cells elevated isoenzyme activity, but only CKMT2 over-expression protected against hypoxia (0.1% for 24h) and reoxygenation demonstrating 25% less cell death compared to non-transfected control (P<0.01). The same cells were not protected from doxorubicin toxicity (250nM for 48h), in contrast to the positive control. These findings support increased CK activity as protection against ischaemia-reperfusion injury, in particular, protection via CKMT2 in a cardiac-relevant cell line, which merits further investigation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2750335547,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the optimal reference geometry for gamma camera calibration. Yet another question of interest was to assess the influence of the number of 3D Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization (3D-OSEM) updates on activity quantification for SPECT imaging with 177Lu. The accuracy of 177Lu activity quantification was assessed both in small and in large objects. Two different reference geometries, namely a cylindrical homogeneous phantom and a Jaszczak 16 ml sphere surrounded by cold water, were used to determine the gamma camera calibration factor of a commercial SPECT/CT system. Moreover, the noise level and the concentration recovery coefficient were evaluated as a function of the number of 3D-OSEM updates by using the SPECT/CT images of the reference geometry phantoms and those of a cold Jaszczak phantom with three hot spheres (16ml, 8ml and 4ml), respectively. The optimal choice of the number of 3D-OSEM updates was based on a compromise between the noise level achievable in the reconstructed SPECT images and the concentration recovery coefficients. The quantitative accuracy achievable was finally validated on a test phantom, where a spherical insert composed of two concentric spheres was used to simulate a lesion in a warm background. Our data confirm and extend previous observations. Using the calibration factor obtained with the cylindrical homogeneous phantom and the Jaszczak 16 ml sphere, the recovered activity in the test phantom was underestimated by -16.4% and -24.8%, respectively. Our work has led us to conclude that gamma camera calibration performed with large homogeneous phantom outperforms calibration executed with the Jaszczak 16ml sphere. Furthermore, the results obtained support the assumption that approximately 50 OSEM updates represent a good trade-off to reach convergence in small volumes, meanwhile minimizing the noise level."

KH domains can be classified into two types (type I and II) on the basis of their topology (18Grishin N.V.

The type I fold exists typically in eukaryotic proteins, and the type II fold exists in prokaryotic proteins. Both types form a cleft consisting of various structural elements, including the α1 helix, α2 helix, GXXG motif, β2 strand, and the variable loop, that accommodates four single-stranded nucleotides (28Valverde R.

Biol. 1996; 6: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), KH domains recognize the RNA substrates primarily through hydrogen bonding, electrostatic and polar interactions, and hydrophobic interactions, excluding the nucleic acid base-to-protein aromatic side chain stacking interaction. The Caenorhabditis elegans MEX-3 (ceMEX-3) protein is one member of the KH domain-containing RNA-binding protein family (30Draper B.W. Mello C.C. Bowerman B. Hardin J. Priess J.R. MEX-3 is a KH domain protein that regulates blastomere identity in early C. elegans embryos.Cell. 1996; 87: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).

The primary phenotype caused by a mutated MEX-3 is an abnormal generation of the body-wall muscles from the anterior blastomere. A family of MEX-3–homologous proteins (MEX-3A–D) was subsequently identified in humans and mice with all proteins retaining the highly conserved dual KH domains and acquiring a RING finger domain with ubiquitin E3 ligase activity at the C terminus, which is absent in ceMEX-3 (37Buchet-Poyau K.

These four homologous mammalian MEX-3 proteins are thought to play similar roles as ceMEX-3. They mediate post-transcriptional regulation in a wide range of biological processes, including hypertension (38Guzmán B. Cormand B. Ribasés M. González-Núñez D. Botey A. Poch E.

Immunol. 2013; 55: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Of these four homologs, MEX-3C is known to be widely expressed in many tissues, especially in the spleen and thymus (43Kuniyoshi K. Takeuchi O. Pandey S. Satoh T. Iwasaki H. Akira S. Kawai T. Pivotal role of RNA-binding E3 ubiquitin ligase MEX3C in RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immunity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 5646-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It has been reported that MEX-3C is associated with several diseases. For instance, polymorphic variations in human MEX-3C (hMEX-3C) have been shown to be responsible for the susceptibility to essential hypertension (38Guzmán B. Cormand B. Ribasés M. González-Núñez D. Botey A. Poch E. Implication of chromosome 18 in hypertension by sibling pair and association analyses: putative involvement of the RKHD2 gene.Hypertension. 2006; 48: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Other studies demonstrated that MEX-3C promotes postnatal growth through translational regulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) mRNA (39Jiao Y. Bishop C.E. Lu B. Mex3c regulates insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) expression and promotes postnatal growth.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 1404-1413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has a pivotal role in the regulation of energy balance because its mutation reduces adiposity and increases energy expenditure (40Jiao Y. George S.K. Zhao Q. Hulver M.W. Hutson S.M. Bishop C.E. Lu B. Mex3c mutation reduces adiposity and increases energy expenditure.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 4350-4362Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). MEX-3C has been identified as a chromosomal instability suppressor in cancer (41Burrell R.A. McClelland S.E. Endesfelder D. Groth P. Weller M.C. Shaikh N. Domingo E. Kanu N. Dewhurst S.M. Gronroos E. Chew S.K. Rowan A.J. Schenk A. Sheffer M. Howell M. et al.Replication stress links structural and numerical cancer chromosomal instability.Nature. 2013; 494: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). MEX-3C has also been reported to be involved in the immune response where it directly or indirectly binds to the viral RNA and regulates the retinoic acid-inducible gene-1–mediated antiviral innate immune response (43Kuniyoshi K. Takeuchi O. Pandey S. Satoh T. Iwasaki H. Akira S. Kawai T. Pivotal role of RNA-binding E3 ubiquitin ligase MEX3C in RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immunity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 5646-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Lehner and co-workers (32Cano F. Bye H. Duncan L.M. Buchet-Poyau K. Billaud M. Wills M.R. Lehner P.J. The RNA-binding E3 ubiquitin ligase MEX-3C links ubiquitination with MHC-I mRNA degradation.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 3596-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Cano F. Rapiteanu R. Sebastiaan Winkler G. Lehner P.J. A non-proteolytic role for ubiquitin in deadenylation of MHC-I mRNA by the RNA-binding E3-ligase MEX-3C.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8670Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) revealed that MEX-3C regulates the expression of the HLA-A2 gene by binding to its 3′-UTR, thereby inducing the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of this mRNA. Moreover, RING-deleted MEX-3C maintains the ability to inhibit the translation of mRNA, similar to its C. elegans ancestor, but is no longer capable of degrading the mRNA. However, the molecular mechanisms of mRNA degradation and translational repression induced by the recognition and binding of MEX-3C KH domains to the 3′-UTR of mRNAs remain to be elucidated. One related challenge would be the identification of the consensus RNA sequence recognized by the MEX-3C KH domains. Using in vitro selection and biochemical analysis, Pagano et al. (36Pagano J.M. Farley B.M. Essien K.I. Ryder S.P. RNA recognition by the embryonic cell fate determinant and germline totipotency factor MEX-3.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 20252-20257Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) identified an RNA sequence motif ((A/G/U)(G/U)AGN0–8U(U/A/C)UA) that was strongly bound by the ceMEX-3 protein. In this sequence, two four-nucleotide half-sites separated by 0–8 nucleotides were shown to be recognized preferentially by two different KH domains connected via a 31-amino acid flexible linker. Because of the high sequence identity of the dual KH domains of hMEX-3C and ceMEX-3 (Fig. 1A) (37Buchet-Poyau K. Courchet J. Le Hir H. Séraphin B. Scoazec J.Y. Duret L. Domon-Dell C. Freund J.N. Billaud M. Identification and characterization of human Mex-3 proteins, a novel family of evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding proteins differentially localized to processing bodies.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 1289-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), this RNA-binding preference could possibly also apply to the hMEX-3C protein. In this study, we determined the high-resolution crystal structures of hMEX-3C KH1–5′-GUUUAG-3′ and KH2–5′-CAGAGU-3′ complexes and analyzed the crucial interactions stabilizing the protein–RNA–binding interface. Furthermore, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were used to verify the crucial interactions contributing to binding specificity and to determine the consensus RNA motifs for two individual KH domains. Based on these results, we mapped the real RNA targets for the hMEX-3C KH domains at the 3′-UTR of HLA-A2 mRNA, which was further confirmed by fluorescence polarization (FP). Using the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment assay, Pagano et al. (36Pagano J.M. Farley B.M. Essien K.I. Ryder S.P. RNA recognition by the embryonic cell fate determinant and germline totipotency factor MEX-3.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 20252-20257Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) previously reported an RNA aptamer, (A/G/U)(G/U)AGN0–8U(U/A/C)UA (MEX-3–recognition element (MRE)), that exhibited strong binding affinities with the KH domains of C. elegans MEX-3. Sequence alignment of hMEX-3C with ceMEX-3 shows that the sequence identity of the dual KH (KH1/2) domains is 73% (Fig. 1A). Because of the high sequence identity, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the KH1/2 domains of hMEX-3C will bind to MRE RNA in a manner similar to that of its C. elegans homolog. Using ITC, we therefore measured the binding affinity of hMEX-3C KH1/2 domains for MRE10, a 10-mer RNA (5′-CAGAGUUUAG-3′) consisting of an eight-nucleotide MRE motif flanked by a cytosine and a guanine at its 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively (Fig. 1B). Our ITC result shows that hMEX-3C KH1/2 domains bind MRE10 with a high affinity (Kd = 0.17 ± 0.01 μm) (Fig. 1C), suggesting that MRE10 could be a potential regulatory target for hMEX-3C. KH domains can typically accommodate four nucleotides in their binding clefts (28Valverde R. Edwards L. Regan L. Structure and function of KH domains.FEBS J. 2008; 275: 2712-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Pagano et al. (36Pagano J.M. Farley B.M. Essien K.I. Ryder S.P. RNA recognition by the embryonic cell fate determinant and germline totipotency factor MEX-3.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 20252-20257Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) suggested that the MRE is a bipartite element that consists of two KH-recognition motifs separated by 0–8 nucleotides, (A/G/U)(G/U)AG and U(U/A/C)UA, and each one can be specifically recognized and bound by an individual KH domain of MEX-3 in C. elegans. To verify this in hMEX-3C, the 10-mer MRE10 was divided into two parts, namely MRE10a comprising the upstream sequence CAGAGU and MRE10b comprising the downstream sequence GUUUAG (Fig. 1B). ITC was used to test their binding affinities for the individual KH domains of hMEX-3C. As summarized in Fig. 1D, hMEX-3C KH1 binds MRE10b with a Kd value of 32.57 ± 1.9 μm, whereas no binding was detected between KH1 and MRE10a. In contrast, KH2 can bind both MRE10a and MRE10b, but the binding affinity for MRE10a was ∼4-fold stronger than that for MRE10b (Kd = 3.15 ± 0.25 μm for MRE10a and 11.79 ± 0.45 μm for MRE10b). Overall, our ITC results indicate that the KH domains in MEX-3 proteins maintain their binding specificities for RNA substrates across different species. Although efforts have been made previously to determine the interaction preferences in the RNA recognition of KH domains, there remain some uncertainties that need further examination. For instance, although adenine or cytosine was often found to occupy the central position(s) of the nucleic acid-binding sites of KH domains (34Nicastro G. Taylor I.A. Ramos A. KH-RNA interactions: back in the groove.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2015; 30: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), a G-rich"
https://openalex.org/W2747931774,"The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a master regulator of protein synthesis and potential target for modifying cellular metabolism in various conditions, including cancer and aging. mTORC1 activity is tightly regulated by the availability of extracellular amino acids, and previous studies have revealed that amino acids in the extracellular fluid are transported to the lysosomal lumen. There, amino acids induce recruitment of cytoplasmic mTORC1 to the lysosome by the Rag GTPases, followed by mTORC1 activation by the small GTPase Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb). However, how the extracellular amino acids reach the lysosomal lumen and activate mTORC1 remains unclear. Here, we show that amino acid uptake by dynamin-dependent endocytosis plays a critical role in mTORC1 activation. We found that mTORC1 is inactivated when endocytosis is inhibited by overexpression of a dominant-negative form of dynamin 2 or by pharmacological inhibition of dynamin or clathrin. Consistently, the recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosome was suppressed by the dynamin inhibition. The activity and lysosomal recruitment of mTORC1 were rescued by increasing intracellular amino acids via cycloheximide exposure or by Rag overexpression, indicating that amino acid deprivation is the main cause of mTORC1 inactivation via the dynamin inhibition. We further show that endocytosis inhibition does not induce autophagy even though mTORC1 inactivation is known to strongly induce autophagy. These findings open new perspectives for the use of endocytosis inhibitors as potential agents that can effectively inhibit nutrient utilization and shut down the upstream signals that activate mTORC1."

New-sensitization rate other than HDM between SLIT and non-SLIT group did not show any significant differences. The distribution of sensitized allergen other than HDM showed increasing tendency after 3 years in both groups. Older age and a small number of sensitized allergen affected the improvement of bronchial hyper-responsiveness regardless of SLIT.HDM SLIT in allergic rhinitis children for 3 years in Korea does not affect prevention of new sensitization and poly-sensitization rate increment, and improvement of bronchial hyper-responsiveness."

To investigate this mechanism we applied electro-acupuncture (EA) in a mouse model of obesity and used RNA-seq to identify molecular consequences. Deletion of the transcription factor STAT5 from neurons (Stat5NKO) led to obesity. Acupuncture, in turn, reduced body weight and the ratio of epididymal white adipose tissue (Epi-WAT) to body weight, and it also decreased plasma concentrations of glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol. In addition, EA increased cold endurance of Stat5NKO obese mice. EA reversed altered gene expressions in the hypothalamus and Epi-WAT, especially in the hypothalamus in Stat5NKO obese mice. This study provides, for the first time, insight into genomic networks of obesity and their modulation by electro-acupuncture, which in turn reveals potential mechanisms that explain acupuncture-induced weight-loss."
https://openalex.org/W2747301962,"Critical care ultrasound (CCUS) has been used by many Intensive Care Units(ICUs) worldwide, so as to guiding the diagnosis and the treatment. However, none of the publications currently systematically describe the utilization of CCUS to analyze the characteristics of hemodynamics and lung pathology upon the new admission to ICU and its potential role in patients' prognosis prediction. In this retrospective clinical study, we have demonstrated and analyzed the characteristics of hemodynamics and lung pathology assessed by CCUS and investigated its potential to predict patient outcome.We have described and analyzed the epidemic characteristics of hemodynamics and lung pathology assessed by CCUS on ICU admission, which based on our database of 451 cases from the biggest medical center in Western China, between November 2014 and October 2015. The patients' demographics, clinical characteristics, prognosis and ultrasonic pattern of hemodynamics and lung pathology had been analyzed. A bivariate logistic regression model was established to identify the correlation between the ultrasonic variables on admission and the ICU mortality.The mean age of the 451 patients was 56.7±18.7 years; the mean APACHE II score was 19.0±7.9, the ICU mortality was 30.6%. Patients received CCUS examination of pericardial, right ventricle (RV) wall motion, left ventricle (LV) wall motion, LV systolic function, LV diastolic function, lung and volume of inferior vena cava (IVC) were 423(93.8%), 418(92.7%), 392(86.9%), 389(86.3%), 383(84.9%), 440(97.6%), 336(74.5%), respectively; The univariate analysis revealed that length of mechanical ventilation was significantly correlated with the diameter of IVC, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion(TAPSE), mitral annular plane systolic excursion(MAPSE), early diastolic transmitral velocity to early mitral annulus diastolic velocity(E/e') (p = 0.016, 0.011, 0.000, 0.049, respectively); The TAPSE, ejection fraction(EF), MAPSE, lung ultrasound score (LUS score) (p = 0.000, 0.028, 0.000, 0.011, respectively) were significantly related to ICU mortality. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that APACHE II, age, TAPSE, E/e' are the independent risk factors for ICU mortality in our study.CCUS examination on ICU admission which performed by the experienced physician provide valuable information to assist the caregivers in understanding the comprehensive outlook of the characteristics of hemodynamics and lung pathology. Those key variables obtained by CCUS predict the possible prognosis of patients, hence deserve more attention in clinical decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2747765271,"Digestion in the stomach depends on acidification of the lumen. Histamine-elicited acid secretion is triggered by activation of the PKA cascade, which ultimately results in the insertion of gastric H,K-ATPases into the apical plasma membranes of parietal cells. Our recent study revealed the functional role of PKA–MST4–ezrin signaling axis in histamine-elicited acid secretion. However, it remains uncharacterized how the PKA–MST4–ezrin signaling axis operates the insertion of H,K-ATPases into the apical plasma membranes of gastric parietal cells. Here we show that MST4 phosphorylates ACAP4, an ARF6 GTPase-activating protein, at Thr545. Histamine stimulation activates MST4 and promotes MST4 interaction with ACAP4. ACAP4 physically interacts with MST4 and is a cognate substrate of MST4 during parietal cell activation. The phosphorylation site of ACAP4 by MST4 was mapped to Thr545 by mass spectrometric analyses. Importantly, phosphorylation of Thr545 is essential for acid secretion in parietal cells because either suppression of ACAP4 or overexpression of non-phosphorylatable ACAP4 prevents the apical membrane reorganization and proton pump translocation elicited by histamine stimulation. In addition, persistent overexpression of MST4 phosphorylation-deficient ACAP4 results in inhibition of gastric acid secretion and blockage of tubulovesicle fusion to the apical membranes. Significantly, phosphorylation of Thr545 enables ACAP4 to interact with ezrin. Given the location of Thr545 between the GTPase-activating protein domain and the first ankyrin repeat, we reason that MST4 phosphorylation elicits a conformational change that enables ezrin–ACAP4 interaction. Taken together, these results define a novel molecular mechanism linking the PKA–MST4–ACAP4 signaling cascade to polarized acid secretion in gastric parietal cells. Digestion in the stomach depends on acidification of the lumen. Histamine-elicited acid secretion is triggered by activation of the PKA cascade, which ultimately results in the insertion of gastric H,K-ATPases into the apical plasma membranes of parietal cells.

Here we show that MST4 phosphorylates ACAP4, an ARF6 GTPase-activating protein, at Thr545. Histamine stimulation activates MST4 and promotes MST4 interaction with ACAP4. ACAP4 physically interacts with MST4 and is a cognate substrate of MST4 during parietal cell activation. The phosphorylation site of ACAP4 by MST4 was mapped to Thr545 by mass spectrometric analyses. Importantly, phosphorylation of Thr545 is essential for acid secretion in parietal cells because either suppression of ACAP4 or overexpression of non-phosphorylatable ACAP4 prevents the apical membrane reorganization and proton pump translocation elicited by histamine stimulation. In addition, persistent overexpression of MST4 phosphorylation-deficient ACAP4 results in inhibition of gastric acid secretion and blockage of tubulovesicle fusion to the apical membranes. Significantly, phosphorylation of Thr545 enables ACAP4 to interact with ezrin. Given the location of Thr545 between the GTPase-activating protein domain and the first ankyrin repeat, we reason that MST4 phosphorylation elicits a conformational change that enables ezrin–ACAP4 interaction. Taken together, these results define a novel molecular mechanism linking the PKA–MST4–ACAP4 signaling cascade to polarized acid secretion in gastric parietal cells. The functions of an epithelium depend on the polarized organization of its individual epithelial cells. The establishment of a fully polarized phenotype and its plasticity control involve a cascade of complex events, including cell–cell adhesion, assembly of a lateral cortical complex, reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and polarized targeting of transport vesicles to the apical and basolateral membranes operated by a cascade of signaling transduction networks (1Yao X. Forte J.G. Cell biology of acid secretion by the parietal cell.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 103-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Mammalian MST4 kinase is a conserved element of the STE20 signaling cascade underlying cell polarity control (2Rawat S.J. Chernoff J. Regulation of mammalian Ste20 (Mst) kinases.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2015; 40: 149-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A recent study shows that MST4 phosphorylates ezrin at Thr567 at the apical membrane of intestinal cells, which induce brush borders (3ten Klooster J.P. Jansen M. Yuan J. Oorschot V. Begthel H.

Ezrin is an actin-binding protein of the ezrin/radixin/moesin family of cytoskeleton–membrane linker proteins (4Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G.

Within the gastric epithelium, ezrin has been localized exclusively to parietal cells and primarily to the apical canalicular membrane of these cells (5Zhou R. Cao X. Watson C. Miao Y. Guo Z.

Previous studies showed that gastric ezrin is co-distributed with the β-actin isoform in vivo (7Yao X. Chaponnier C. Gabbiani G. Forte J.G.

It was postulated that ezrin couples the activation of PKA to the apical membrane remodeling associated with parietal cell secretion (5Zhou R. Cao X. Watson C. Miao Y. Guo Z. Forte J.G. Yao X.

In fact, the PKA phosphorylation site on ezrin was mapped and demonstrated to be functionally important in histamine-elicited gastric acid secretion (5Zhou R. Cao X. Watson C. Miao Y. Guo Z.

Suzuki Y. Noda T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Achlorhydria by ezrin knockdown: defects in the formation/expansion of apical canaliculi in gastric parietal cells.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) demonstrated that knocking down ezrin in the stomach to <5% of the wild-type level results in severe achlorhydria. In these parietal cells, H,K-ATPase–containing tubulovesicles failed to fuse with the apical membrane, suggesting an essential role of ezrin in tubulovesicle docking. Our recent studies showed that PKA cooperates with MST4 to orchestrate histamine-elicited acid secretion by phosphorylating ezrin at Ser66 and Thr567, respectively (11Jiang H. Wang W. Zhang Y. Yao W.W. Jiang J. Qin B. Yao W.Y. Liu F. Wu H. Ward T.L. Chen C.W. Liu L. Ding X. Liu X. Yao X.

Chem. 2015; 290: 28272-28285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Histamine stimulation activates PKA, which phosphorylates MST4 at Thr178 and then promotes MST4 kinase activity. Our studies show that MST4 is important for acid secretion in parietal cells because either suppression of MST4 or overexpression of non-phosphorylatable MST4 prevents the apical membrane reorganization and proton pump translocation elicited by histamine stimulation. However, it was unclear how MST4 activity is orchestrated and links to tubulovesicle fusion to the apical membrane and concomitant remodeling of the apical membrane during parietal cell activation. Our early studies revealed that ezrin interacts with ACAP4, an ADP ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) 6The abbreviations used are: ARFADP ribosylation factorGAPGTPase-activating proteinNSnon-secretingSLOStreptolysin OAPaminopyrineMEMminimal essential mediumIBMXisobutylmethylxanthine.

ACAP4 locates in the cytoplasmic tubulovesicle membrane in resting parietal cells but translocates to the apical plasma membrane upon histamine stimulation. Importantly, ezrin specifies the apical distribution of ACAP4 in secreting parietal cells because either suppression of ezrin or overexpression of non-phosphorylatable ezrin prevents the apical localization of ACAP4. Although these results define a novel molecular mechanism linking ACAP4–ezrin interaction to polarized epithelial secretion, it was undetermined whether MST4 activity regulates ACAP4 activation and how MST4 orchestrates tubulovesicle trafficking to the apical membrane during parietal cell activation. ADP ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein non-secreting Streptolysin O aminopyrine minimal essential medium isobutylmethylxanthine. Here we show that ACAP4 is downstream from MST4 during parietal cell activation. MST4 phosphorylates ACAP4 at Thr545, which is essential for parietal cell acid secretion. Importantly, Thr545 is located between GAP domain and the first ankyrin repeat. We reason that MST4-induced phosphorylation of Thr545 elicits a conformational change to enable ACAP4 binding to ezrin phosphorylated by PKA. Thus, our study provides novel insight into the PKA–MST4–ACAP4 signaling axis in polarized membrane trafficking in stimulus-coupled acid secretion in parietal cells. Our previous studies revealed the functional importance of ACAP4 in membrane cytoskeletal dynamics during stimulus-coupled membrane remodeling (12Ding X. Deng H. Wang D. Zhou J. Huang Y. Zhao X.

Because ACAP4 relocates from the cytoplasm to the apical plasma membrane during gastric parietal cell activation, we sought to examine the role of ACAP4 in stimulus-coupled parietal cell activation. To study the molecular association of ACAP4 with other accessory proteins, we carried out affinity isolation of an ACAP4-containing protein complex followed by mass spectrometric identification of tryptic peptides derived from the complex, as described previously (12Ding X.

Specifically, an ACAP4 affinity matrix was used to isolate the ACAP4-associated large-mass complex in histamine-stimulated parietal cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, anti-ACAP4 affinity beads coupled to an anti-ACAP4 antibody isolated a major polypeptide of 99 kDa in addition to three visible bands of polypeptides with approximate masses of 55 kDa, 45 kDa and 25 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1A, lane 1). The 45-kDa polypeptide was absent from the ACAP4 antibody affinity matrix incubated with non-secreting (NS) parietal cell lysates (Fig. 1A, lane 2) and was confirmed as MST4 based on mass spectrometry and Western blot analyses (Fig. 1A, bottom panel, lane 1). Our mass spectrometric analyses identified the 45-kDa polypeptide as MST4, a characterized cell polarity kinase interacting with ezrin in cell polarity establishment and parietal cell acid secretion (11Jiang H. Wang W. Zhang Y. Yao W.W. Jiang J. Qin B. Yao W.Y. Liu F. Wu H. Ward T.L. Chen C.W. Liu L. Ding X. Liu X. Yao X.

Chem. 2015; 290: 28272-28285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Western blotting analyses validated that the actin-binding protein ezrin also exists in the immunoprecipitates of ACAP4 in secreting parietal cells (Fig. 1B, lane 3) but not non-secreting parietal cells (Fig. 1B, lane 4). As a negative control, tubulin was absent from ACAP4 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). The cortical cytoskeleton constitutes an important subcellular structure that determines cell shape and orchestrates cellular dynamics. Ezrin is a signaling scaffold protein located on the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells for integration of diverse signaling pathways. The identification of MST4 and ezrin in the ACAP4 protein complex prompted us to validate the interaction of MST4–ACAP4 using reciprocal immunoprecipitation, in which MST4 antibody isolated ACAP4 only from secreting parietal cells but not from non-secreting cells (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4). We next examined whether MST4 is co-localized with ACAP4 in gastric parietal cells. To this end, we carried out immunofluorescence microscopic analyses of isolated gastric glands doubly stained for ACAP4 and MST4. As shown in Fig. 1D, ACAP4 distributes in the cytoplasm of gastric parietal cells (a′, white arrowheads). ACAP4 and MST4 are absent from non-parietal cells such as gastric chief cells (Fig. 1D, a′ and b′, yellow arrows). Interestingly, this parietal cell–selective localization of ACAP4 is largely superimposed onto that of MST4 when two channels were merged (Fig. 1D, c′, white arrowheads). Phase-contrast imaging of the same gastric glands confirmed the preferential enrichment of ACAP4 and MST4 in gastric parietal cells (Fig. 1D, d′). Interestingly, an enlarged montage from merged images suggested a partial co-distribution of ACAP4 with MST4 within parietal cells (Fig. 1D, c′). Thus, we conclude that ACAP4 interacts and co-distributes with MST4 in gastric parietal cells. Our recent work has established the essential role of MST4 in gastric parietal cell activation (11Jiang H. Wang W. Zhang Y. Yao W.W. Jiang J. Qin B. Yao W.Y. Liu F. Wu H. Ward T.L. Chen C.W. Liu L. Ding X. Liu X. Yao X. Cell polarity kinase MST4 cooperates with cAMP-dependent kinase to orchestrate histamine-stimulated acid secretion in gastric parietal cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 28272-28285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Identification of the stimulation-elicited MST4–ACAP4 interaction prompted us to examine whether ACAP4 is a substrate of MST4 during parietal cell activation. To this end, we isolated the ACAP4 protein band from SDS-PAGE shown in Fig. 1A and subjected it for phosphorylation site mapping using mass spectrometric analyses. A resulting peptide containing pThr545 (addition of a phospho group with neutral loss of a water molecule) was resolved by MS-MS (b- and y-series ions are labeled). As shown in Fig. 2A, the prominent b-series ions b3, 5, 6, and 7 and y-series ions y6 and y7 present unambiguous evidence for pThr545. Our mass spectrometric analyses of pThr545 of ACAP4 suggest that it is a potential substrate for MST4 kinase. Computational analyses of ACAP4 structural domains reveal that Thr545 is located between the GAP domain and ankyrin repeat of ACAP4 (Fig. 2B). To test whether Thr545 is a substrate of MST4, we performed in vitro phosphorylation on recombinant His6–ACAP4 fusion proteins, including both wild-type ACAP4 and a mutant ACAP4 in which Thr545 was replaced by alanine (T545A). Both histidine fusion proteins, wild-type and the Thr545-mutated ACAP4 mutant (ACAP4T545A), migrate at about the predicted 99 kDa, as shown in Fig. 2C (top panel, Coomassie Blue staining). Incubation of the fusion proteins with [γ-32P]ATP and MST4 resulted in incorporation of 32P into the wild type but not the ACAP4T545A mutant (Fig. 2C, bottom panel, lanes 2 and 3). This MST4-mediated phosphorylation is specific because incubation of MST4 with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 20 nm hesperadin, a chemical inhibitor of MST4 (17Xiong W. Matheson C.J. Xu M. Backos D.S. Mills T.S. Salian-Mehta S. Kiseljak-Vassiliades K. Reigan P. Wierman M.E.

Cancer Ther. 2016; 15: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), resulted in undetectable incorporation of radioactivity into the wild-type protein (Fig. 2C, bottom panel, lane 1). Quantitative analyses showed that incorporation of 32P into ACAP4 is a function of MST4 (Fig. 2D). Thus, Thr545 of ACAP4 is a bona fide substrate for MST4. Because parietal cell activation involves ezrin-mediated reorganization of the apical membrane cytoskeleton (11Jiang H. Wang W. Zhang Y. Yao W.W. Jiang J. Qin B. Yao W.Y. Liu F. Wu H. Ward T.L. Chen C.W. Liu L. Ding X. Liu X. Yao X. Cell polarity kinase MST4 cooperates with cAMP-dependent kinase to orchestrate histamine-stimulated acid secretion in gastric parietal cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 28272-28285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we sought to probe the localization of ACAP4 using immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3A, a′, ACAP4 is primarily localized to the cytoplasm of parietal cells treated with cimetidine as a diffused signal. However, ACAP4 is enriched in the apical membrane as two interconnected and dilated rings in a single cell in response to histamine stimulation (Fig. 3A, b′). To evaluate the functional importance of ACAP4 phosphorylation in parietal cell secretion, we adopted apical vacuole diameter (Fig. 3B, Apical Dia.) as a reporter for parietal cell secretory activity (18Yu H. Zhou J. Takahashi H. Yao W. Suzuki Y. Yuan X. Yoshimura S.H. Zhang Y. Liu Y. Emmett N. Bond V. Wang D. Ding X. Takeyasu K. Yao X. Spatial control of proton pump H,K-ATPase docking at the apical membrane by phosphorylation-coupled ezrin-syntaxin 3 interaction.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 33333-33342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Quantitative analyses of 100 parietal cells from cimetidine and histamine treatment, as summarized in Fig. 3B, demonstrated that stimulation dramatically extended the apical vacuole diameter to 15.7 ± 0.9 μm, whereas the average vacuole diameter of cimetidine cells was only 2.3 ± 0.5 μm, which represents ∼14.6% of maximal secretory activity. Pretreatment with hesperadin abolished the histamine-elicited apical dilation (24.3% ± 5.3% of maximal dilation), consistent with the role of MST4 in parietal cell activation (Fig. 3B; **, p < 0.01). The measurement of apical vacuole diameter as parietal cell activation is consistent with the secretary activity assay of aminopyrine (AP) uptake, which quantifies gastric acid secretion (Fig. 3B). We therefore reason that MST4 is essential for the dynamic translocation of ACAP4 and remodeling of the apical membrane of parietal cells associated with the stimulation of gastric acid secretion. To evaluate the role of MST4-elicited phosphorylation of ACAP4 in parietal cell activation, we attempted to transiently transfect cultured parietal cells for expressing exogenous ACAP4. To test the efficiency of exogenous ACAP4 expression, cultured parietal cells were transfected with GFP-tagged wild-type and phosphorylation-mutant ACAP4 plasmids. Western blot analysis carried out using transfected cells showed that exogenously expressed ACAP4 proteins were about 2.5- to 3.1-fold higher than the level of endogenous ACAP4 in cultured parietal cells (Fig. 3C). Assuming a transfection efficiency of about 50–55%, the actual expression level of GFP-ACAP4 in positively transfected cells is about 5-fold higher than that of endogenous protein. Parietal cell activation exhibits characteristic translocation of H,K-ATPase from tubulovesicles to the apical membrane; therefore, we sought to examine parietal cell activation in phospho-mimicking ACAP4 (GFP-ACAP4T545D)-expressing and non-phosphorylatable ACAP4 (GFP-ACAP4T545A)-expressing cells, respectively. The transfected cells were then treated with either cimetidine or histamine before being fixed for immunofluorescence microscopic analyses. As shown in Fig. 3D, although GFP-ACAP4T545A is primarily localized to the cytoplasm of cimetidine-treated cells (a′), it becomes relocated to the apical plasma membrane in response to histamine stimulation (b′). Consistent with our speculation, expression of phospho-mimicking ACAP4 (ACAP4T545D) resulted in expansion of the apical membrane in parietal cells (Fig. 3D, c′), as the majority of ACAP4T545D is concentrated at the apical membrane of parietal cells. ACAP4T545D-expressing cells produce characteristic vacuolar swelling in response to histamine stimulation (Fig. 3D, d′), suggesting a potential role of MST4 activation in recruiting H,K-ATPase–containing vesicles to the apical membrane. Quantitative analyses demonstrated that ACAP4 is relocated to the apical membrane in response to histamine-elicited MST4 activation (Fig. 3E). Dilation of apical vacuoles is a characteristic of secreting parietal cells (5Zhou R. Cao X. Watson C. Miao Y. Guo Z. Forte J.G. Yao X.

Chem. 2003; 278: 35651-35659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Typically, the average diameter of apical vacuoles in cimetidine-treated, non-secreting parietal cells is 2.9 ± 0.3 μm, whereas the diameter for histamine-stimulated secreting cells is 15.7 ± 1.1 μm, consistent with previous studies (5Zhou R.

The vacuolar measurements, summarized in Fig. 3F, indicate that abrogation of MST4-elicited ACAP4 phosphorylation prevents the histamine-elicited apical vacuole dilation seen in ACAP4T545A-expressing cells. We therefore reason that MST4–ACAP4 interaction is essential for the dynamic remodeling of the apical plasma membrane of parietal cells associated with the stimulation. The functional importance of ACAP4 phosphorylation in parietal cell secretion prompted us to examine the precise function of MST4–PKA interaction in parietal cell activation. To directly probe for the function of MST4–ACAP4 interaction, we sought to introduce wild-type and mutant ACAP4 (T545A and T545D) into cultured parietal cells by transient transfection (12Ding X.

Chem. 2008; 283: 26714-26725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As predicted, histamine stimulation of wild-type ACAP4-expressing cells produced dramatic acid secretion, as judged by AP uptake (Fig. 3G). However, the ACAP4T545A mutant inhibited histamine-elicited parietal cell secretion, whereas ACAP4T545D synergizes with histamine, which resulted in maximal acid secretion equivalent to 125% of that seen in wild type–expressing cells. This secretory activity is dependent on H,K-ATPase, as treatment with the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole (100 nm) abolished histamine stimulation of acid secretion (Fig. 3G). These results suggest that ACAP4 cooperates with MST4 for maximal parietal cell secretion via phosphorylating ACAP4 at Thr545 and that acid secretion is dependent on proton pump H,K-ATPase. The crystal structure reveals that the linker region between the ankyrin repeat and GAP domain exhibits great flexibility to bridge compact lobes. Thr545 resides in the flexible loop, based on the molecular modeling shown in Fig. 4A. We speculate that phosphorylation of Thr545 elicits a conformational change of ACAP4 to enable the interaction of MST4 with ACAP4. To test this hypothesis, we performed in vitro binding assays in which phosphorylated and non-phosphorylatable ACAP4 proteins were used as inputs to test for its ability to bind to the affinity matrix containing ezrin proteins (S66A and S66D; Fig. 4B, lanes 3–7). As shown in Fig. 4B, the His6-tagged ezrin S66A and S66D proteins migrate at about the predicted 80 kDa (top panel, Coomassie Blue staining). Non-phosphorylatable ACAP4 failed to bind to S66A and S66D affinity beads (Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and 6). Interestingly, phosphorylation-mimicking ACAP4 was only retained on S66D affinity matrix (Fig. 4B, lane 5), indicating a context-dependent association between ACAP4 and ezrin. The Western blot analyses confirmed this phosphorylation-dependent ACAP4 association with ezrin. Consistent with the notion of phosphorylation-dependent ACAP4–ezrin association, phosphorylation-mimicking ACAP4 failed to be retained on the wild-type ezrin affinity matrix, as judged by Western blot analyses (Fig. 4C, bottom panel, lane 4). This context-dependent ACAP4 association with phosphorylated ezrin was also confirmed using an immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 4D). Thus, we conclude that MST4 phosphorylation of ACAP4 at Thr545 enables ACAP4 binding to ezrin. To directly probe for the function of phosphorylation-dependent MST4–ACAP4 interaction in parietal cell activation, we sought to introduce wild-type and mutant ACAP4 (T545A and T545D) together with wild-type and mutant ezrin (S66A and S66D) into SLO-permeabilized parietal cells to mimic PKA phosphorylation in vivo using a protocol reported previously (12Ding X.

https://openalex.org/W2750162485,"Background Epilepsy treatment gap range from 87% to 98%. In spite of this, there is a gross inadequacy of the availability, accessibility and affordability of Anti-Epileptic Drugs. In countries like Ethiopia, where most populations are less aware about mental health problems, most people seek help for their illness from traditional healers. Thus, the main purpose of this study was to assess the pathways to epilepsy care and associated factors. Methods Cross-sectional study design utilized among 409 participants selected by systematic random sampling technique. Pathways to epilepsy care were assessed by using the WHO Pathway Study tool. Multivariable logistic regression was done to identify factors associated with pathways to epileptic care. Results Overall, 162 (39.6%) of participants first contacted with modern treatment. Two hundred and forty seven (60.4%) of participants counted traditional healers and religious healers were the most common (47.2%). Being men, attending higher education, urban residence, short duration of illness, social support and age at the onset of illness were factors associated with first contact with modern treatment. Conclusion Modern treatment was not the first place of choice for the majority of the respondents. Strengthening awareness creation program about epilepsy and its treatment is highly recommended with special emphases to urban dwellers and less educated people."

Patients with cfPWV >10 m/s were defined as the high aortic stiffness group.Thirty-seven patients (35.6%) had high aortic stiffness and higher percentages of diabetes (p = 0.001), were of older age (p = 0.001) and had higher waist circumference (p < 0.001), systolic blood pressure (p = 0.027), pulse pressure (p = 0.013), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (p < 0.001) and resistin levels (p < 0.001) but lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (p = 0.009) compared to subjects with low aortic stiffness. After adjusting for factors significantly associated with aortic stiffness by multivariate logistic regression analysis, serum resistin (odds ratio = 1.275, 95% confidence interval: 1.065-1.527, p = 0.008) was also found to be an independent predictor of aortic stiffness in patients with CAD.Serum resistin level is a biomarker for aortic stiffness in patients with CAD."
https://openalex.org/W2746287260,"The plasma kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) consists of serine proteases, prekallikrein (pKal) and factor XII (FXII), and a cofactor, high-MW kininogen (HK). Upon activation, activated pKal and FXII cleave HK to release bradykinin. Activation of this system has been noted in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and its pathogenic role has been characterized in animal arthritic models. In this study, we generated 2 knockout mouse strains that lacked pKal and HK and determined the role of KKS in autoantibody-induced arthritis. In a K/BxN serum transfer-induced arthritis (STIA) model, mice that lacked HK, pKal, or bradykinin receptors displayed protective phenotypes in joint swelling, histologic changes in inflammation, and cytokine production; however, FXII-deficient mice developed normal arthritis. Inhibition of Kal ameliorated arthritis severity and incidence at early stage STIA and reduced the levels of major cytokines in joints. In addition to releasing bradykinin from HK, Kal directly activated monocytes to produce proinflammatory cytokines, up-regulated their C5aR and FcRIII expression, and released C5a. Immune complex increased pKal activity, which led to HK cleavage. The absence of HK is associated with a decrease in joint vasopermeability. Thus, we identify a critical role for Kal in autoantibody-induced arthritis with pleiotropic effects, which suggests that it is a new target for the inhibition of arthritis.-Yang, A., Zhou, J., Wang, B., Dai, J., Colman, R.

https://openalex.org/W2747199958,"The RNA interference (RNAi) pathway was recently expanded by the discovery of multiple alternative pathways for processing of natural microRNA (miRNA) and man-made short hairpin RNA (shRNA) molecules. One non-canonical pathway bypasses Dicer cleavage and requires instead processing by Argonaute2 (Ago2), which also executes the subsequent silencing step. We named these molecules AgoshRNA, which generate only a single active RNA strand and thus avoid off-target effects that can be induced by the passenger strand of a regular shRNA. Previously, we characterized AgoshRNA processing by deep sequencing and demonstrated that—after Ago2 cleavage—AgoshRNAs acquire a short 3’ tail of 1–3 A-nucleotides and are subsequently trimmed, likely by the poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN). As a result, the mature single-stranded AgoshRNA may dock more stably into Ago2. Here we set out to analyze the activity of different synthetic AgoshRNA processing intermediates. Ago2 was found to bind preferentially to partially single-stranded AgoshRNA in vitro. In contrast, only the double-stranded AgoshRNA precursor associated with Ago2 in cells, correlating with efficient intracellular processing and reporter knockdown activity. These results suggest the presence of a cellular co-factor involved in AgoshRNA loading into Ago2 in vivo. We also demonstrate specific AgoshRNA loading in Ago2, but not Ago1/3/4, thus further reducing unwanted side effects."

En2 has been suggested to be an autism susceptibility gene and individuals with autism display an overexpression of this homeogene but the mechanisms remain unclear. We addressed in the present study the effect of exogenously added En2 on the morphology of hippocampal cells that normally express only low levels of Engrailed proteins. By means of RT-qPCR, we confirmed that En1 and En2 were expressed at low levels in hippocampus and hippocampal neurons, and observed a pronounced decrease in En2 expression at birth and during the first postnatal week, a period characterized by intense synaptogenesis. To address a putative effect of Engrailed in dendritogenesis or synaptogenesis, we added recombinant En1 or En2 proteins to hippocampal cell cultures. Both En1 and En2 treatment increased the complexity of the dendritic tree of glutamatergic neurons, but only En2 increased that of GABAergic cells. En1 increased the density of dendritic spines both in vitro and in vivo. En2 had similar but less pronounced effect on spine density. The number of mature synapses remained unchanged upon En1 treatment but was reduced by En2 treatment, as well as the area of post-synaptic densities. Finally, both En1 and En2 elevated mTORC1 activity and protein synthesis in hippocampal cells, suggesting that some effects of Engrailed proteins may require mRNA translation. Our results indicate that Engrailed proteins can play, even at low concentrations, an active role in the morphogenesis of hippocampal cells. Further, they emphasize the over-regulation of GABA cell morphology and the vulnerability of excitatory synapses in a pathological context of En2 overexpression."

Pathogenic mutations in PINK1 have been identified as a cause of early-onset autosomal recessive familial Parkinson’s disease (PD). The ubiquitin proteasome pathway is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we investigated whether mutations of PINK1 affects the cellular stress response following proteasome inhibition. Administration of MG132, a peptide aldehyde proteasome inhibitor, significantly increased the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in rat dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and in the SH-SY5Y neuronal cell line. The induction of HO-1 expression by proteasome inhibition was reduced in PINK1 G309D mutant cells. MG132 increased the levels of HO-1 through the Akt, p38, and Nrf2 signaling pathways. Compared with the cells expressing WT-PINK1, the phosphorylation of Akt and p38 was lower in those cells expressing the PINK1 G309D mutant, which resulted in the inhibition of the nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Furthermore, MG132-induced neuronal death was enhanced by the PINK1 G309D mutation. In this study, we demonstrated that the G309D mutation impairs the neuroprotective function of PINK1 following proteasome inhibition, which may be related to the pathogenesis of PD."
https://openalex.org/W2747545869,"DNA polymerases depend on circular sliding clamps for processive replication. Clamps must be loaded onto primer–template DNA (ptDNA) by clamp loaders that open and close clamps around ptDNA in an ATP-fueled reaction. All clamp loaders share a core structure in which five subunits form a spiral chamber that binds the clamp at its base in a twisted open form and encloses ptDNA within, while binding and hydrolyzing ATP to topologically link the clamp and ptDNA. To understand how clamp loaders perform this complex task, here we focused on conserved arginines that might play a central coordinating role in the mechanism because they can alternately contact ptDNA or Walker B glutamate in the ATPase site and lie close to the clamp loader–clamp-binding interface. We mutated Arg-84, Arg-88, and Arg-101 in the ATPase-active B, C, and D subunits of Saccharomyces cerevisiae replication factor C (RFC) clamp loader, respectively, and assessed the impact on multiple transient events in the reaction: proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) clamp binding/opening/closure/release, ptDNA binding/release, and ATP hydrolysis/product release. The results show that these arginines relay critical information between the PCNA-binding, DNA-binding, and ATPase sites at all steps of the reaction, particularly at a checkpoint before RFC commits to ATP hydrolysis. Moreover, their actions are subunit-specific with RFC-C Arg-88 serving as an accelerator that enables rapid ATP hydrolysis upon contact with ptDNA and RFC-D Arg-101 serving as a brake that confers specificity for ptDNA as the correct substrate for loading PCNA."
https://openalex.org/W2748482417,"Isolation of microparticles and biological cells from mixtures and suspensions is a central problem in a variety of biomedical applications. This problem, for instance, is of an immense importance for microfluidic devices manipulating with whole blood samples. It is instructive to know how the mobility and dynamics of rigid microparticles is altered by the presence of micrometer-size roughness on walls. The presented theoretical study addresses this issue via computer simulations. The approach is based on a combination of the Lattice Boltzmann method for calculating hydrodynamics and the Lagrangian Particle dynamics method to describe the dynamics of cell membranes. The effect of the roughness on the mobility of spheroidal microparticles in a shear fluid flow was quantified. We conclude that mechanical and hydrodynamic interactions lift the particles from the surface and change their mobility. The effect is sensitive to the shape of particles."

Previous investigations have established that DnaB is composed of an N-terminal domain, a middle domain, and a C-terminal domain. However, structural evidence for how DnaB functions at the atomic level is lacking. Here, we report the crystal structure of DnaB, encompassing the N-terminal and middle domains (residues 1–300), from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (GstDnaB1–300) at 2.8 Å resolution. Our structure revealed that GstDnaB1–300 forms a tetramer with two basket-like architectures, a finding consistent with those from solution studies using analytical ultracentrifugation. Furthermore, our results from both GST pulldown assays and analytical ultracentrifugation show that GstDnaB1–300 is sufficient to form a complex with PriA, the primosomal reinitiation protein. Moreover, with the aid of small angle X-ray scattering experiments, we also determined the structural envelope of full-length DnaB (GstDnaBFL) in solution. These small angle X-ray scattering studies indicated that GstDnaBFL has an elongated conformation and that the protruding density envelopes originating from GstDnaB1–300 could completely accommodate the GstDnaB C-terminal domain (residues 301–461).

Sequential assembly of the primosome complex is one the most important processes that drives DNA replication in all bacterial species.

Once the DNA replication process is stalled, it undergoes a reinitiation process, and the primosome re-initiation protein PriA is recruited at the respective sites (11Sandler S.J. Marians K.J.

However, DnaA and PriA in E. coli and B. subtilis differ in their recruitment of subsequent loader proteins before recruitment of the replicative helicase. During the normal replication process in Gram-negative E. coli, DnaA recognizes oriC sites and recruits DnaB helicase with the help of the helicase loader protein DnaC and promotes the association of the primase DnaG (2Lo Y.H.

In instances of abnormal DNA repair and restart, PriA recognizes the stalled forks and sequentially recruits three other primosomal reinitiation proteins (PriB, PriC, and DnaT) and a loader protein DnaC to trigger re-loading of hexameric replicative helicase as a helicase-loader complex DnaB-DnaC to restart the replication process (13Marians K.J. PriA-directed replication fork restart in Escherichia coli.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 185-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These two distinct primosome reinitiation processes share the same helicase (DnaB) and primase (DnaG) in the replisome system. However, in Gram-positive bacteria homologues of PriB, PriC, and DnaT are absent. Instead, only the primosomal loader proteins DnaB and DnaD are found, which are mediated by both DnaA and PriA to initiate and restart the replication process at oriC and stalled forks, respectively (12Moriya S.

In this study we determined the crystal structure of the truncated form (residues 1–300) of DnaB from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (GstDnaB1–300) at 2.8 Å resolution. The GstDnaB1–300 crystal structure describes a unique tetrameric organization comprising two dimers arranged in a domain-swap conformation. The results from our GST pulldown assays and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) suggest that GstDnaB physically interacts with GstPriA.

Our results enhance understanding of the domain arrangement of DnaBFL and its biological role in association with the replication re-initiation protein PriA. The Gram-positive bacterial helicase loader protein DnaB from G. stearothermophilus (GstDnaB) comprises 461 residues. Based on proteolysis assays using proteinase K and trypsin digestion studies of B. subtilis, BsuDnaB is structurally organized into three domains: residues 1–184 (N-terminal), 204–296 (middle), and 297–472 (C-terminal) (31Núñez-Ramírez R.

The corresponding domains in GstDnaB comprise residues 1–144 (N-terminal), 201–290 (middle), and 304–461 (C-terminal) (described in further detail in the following sections). To identify the sequence variation between species, we aligned the GstDnaB sequence with that of BsuDnaB. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1, GstDnaB exhibits 47.2% overall sequence identity with BsuDnaB. The lowest sequence similarity was observed between residues 150 and 204 and in the extreme C-terminal region (residues 430 and 460) of DnaB. The DNA replication restart process and the underlying mechanics relating to the association of co-proteins in Gram-positive bacteria needs further clarification.

Farache M. McGovern S. Ehrlich S.D. Polard P. DnaB, DnaD, and DnaI proteins are components of the Bacillus subtilis replication restart primosome.Mol.

Functional interplay between the Bacillus subtilis DnaD and DnaB proteins essential for initiation and re-initiation of DNA replication.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1138-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this regard it is not clear whether the DnaB loader protein associates directly or indirectly with primosomal protein PriA and other loader proteins. Hence, we aimed to test for direct association of GstDnaB with GstPriA. To this end, we performed glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assays using purified recombinant full-length GstDnaB (GstDnaBFL) and truncated forms (GstDnaB1–300 or GstDnaB301–461) as fusion proteins containing an N-terminal GST moiety (GST-GstDnaBFL, GST-GstDnaB1–300, or GST-GstDnaB301–461). As shown in Fig. 1A, GstPriA specifically interacted with GST-GstDnaBFL and GST-GstDnaB1–300, whereas interaction was completely abolished for the C-terminal region (GstDnaB301–461). This suggests that the N-terminal and middle domains of GstDnaB are essential for interactions with GstPriA. To corroborate this interaction between GstDnaB andGstPriA, we performed sedimentation-velocity experiments through AUC to provide direct evidence of complex formation in solution. Five different fragments of GstDnaB (GstDnaBFL, GstDnaB1–300, GstDnaB301–461, GstDnaB1–200, and GstDnaB202–300) were individually mixed with an equal molar ratio of GstPriA (1:1) and then subjected to AUC. The sedimentation coefficient of GstPriA alone was 5.1 S, which corresponds to the relative molecular mass of the monomer ∼89.5 kDa (green dashed lines in Fig. 1, B–F). The sedimentation coefficient of GstDnaBFL alone was 7.2 S, which corresponds to the relative molecular mass of the tetramer ∼212 kDa (red dashed lines in Fig. 1B). With respect to GstPriA interaction with full-length GstDnaB, we noticed the formation of two distinct major peaks, denoted as A and B in the GstDnaBFL/GstPriA mixture. Peak A has a sedimentation coefficient of ∼5.2 S, which is similar to the 5.1 S for GstPriA alone. However, the s value of peak B was 8.3 S, which is much greater than that for the GstDnaBFL tetramer alone, clearly indicating that this peak corresponds to a GstDnaBFL-GstPriA complex. Consistently, similar results were observed when GstDnaB1–300 was substituted for GstDnaBFL in the above experiment (Fig. 1C); the sedimentation coefficient of peak A (5.2 S) corresponded closely to GstPriA alone, whereas the s value of peak B was also much higher than for the GstDnaB1–300 tetramer alone (7.1 S), indicating formation of a complex between GstDnaB1–300 and GstPriA. However, consistent with our earlier GST pulldown experiments, we did not find an interaction between GstDnaB301–461 and GstPriA as a shift in the protein peaks of the mixture (blue line, Fig. 1D) was not observed, and instead, the peaks were much closer to those of both GstDnaB301–461 and GstPriA alone (green and red dashed lines, Fig. 1D). In addition, the s value of GstPriA-GstDnaB1–300 complex (peak B of Fig. 1C) was 7.1 S, which is similar to the s value of GstDnaBFL tetramer. This would give an estimated molecular weight of the GstPriA-GstDnaB1–300 complex at 7.1 S was ∼212 kDa. Therefore, this indicated that the stoichiometry between GstPriA and GstDnaB complex most likely is 1–4. To further corroborate the stability for the complex between GstDnaB and GstPriA in solution, we also performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments. As shown in the supplemental Fig. S2, the dissociation constant (Kd) between GstDnaB1–300 and GstPriA was 47.2 μm, and the C-value in ITC experiment is 1.4. The low C-value range from 1 to 5 often leads to a large error in fitting, a result of stoichiometry (N). Fortunately, the decoupled of Kd with the error in N at the low C-value permits the determination of Kd when the titration proceeds to a near saturate level (35Tellinghuisen J. Isothermal titration calorimetry at very low c.Anal. Biochem. 2008; 373: 395-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Due to the low C value (1.4) in our original setting, we also switched the order of syringe and cell component in the experiment by titrating high concentration of GstPriA (780 μm) to GstDnaB1–300 (40 μm). The best fittings of Kd, N, and C values were 72.9, 0.215 and 0.12, respectively. Although the stoichiometry was quite matched to our expectations, the standard error was large due to the low C value. On the other hand, the Kd had a reasonable standard error and was in a similar range compare with our other ITC data with a wild range of concentration. Therefore, we only discussed the Kd from ITC but did not take N into consideration. In addition, our ITC result indicated that the interaction between GstDnaB and GstPriA is dynamic. This dynamic interaction may be crucial for the formation, rearrangement and dissociation of the primosomal complexes. To identify the GstPriA-binding region in the GstDnaB1–300 protein segment, we prepared two truncated forms of the protein (GstDnaB1–145 and GstDnaB160–300). However, neither truncated form was soluble. Hence, we then generated two other soluble truncated forms (GstDnaB1–200 and GstDnaB202–300) and subjected them to sedimentation-velocity AUC. As shown in Fig. 1E, the mixture of GstDnaB1–200 and GstPriA produced a broader peak (blue line) covering tetrameric GstDnaB1–200 alone and monomeric GstPriA alone (red and green dashed lines), but a shift in the peak or a change to the sedimentation coefficient was not observed. This result indicates that GstDnaB1–200 is not sufficient to interact with GstPriA. We did not observe complex formation between GstDnaB202–300 and GstPriA; protein peaks of this mixture (blue line, Fig. 1F) did not shift noticeably, and its sedimentation coefficient was similar to that of GstDnaB202–300 and GstPriA alone (green and red dashed lines, Fig. 1F). In brief, our sedimentation-velocity AUC results further support the GST pulldown assays in demonstrating DnaB interaction with PriA. Both the N-terminal and middle domain regions are required to establish this interaction, and the connecting flexible linker might have some additional role in PriA interaction. We found that the C-terminal domain of GstDnaB is not involved in PriA interaction, but it may have another role in DNA binding or in the recruitment of other primosome machinery for further DNA unwinding, and this topic warrants further study. Previous structural studies of DnaB have been limited to a low resolution using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and EM (29Zhang W. Carneiro M.J. Turner I.J. Allen S. Roberts C.J. Soultanas P.

Biol. 2007; 367: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which lack detailed structural information at the atomic level. To unravel the structural details of GstDnaB to better understand its biological role in primosome assembly and replication restart, we first attempted to crystallize full-length GstDnaB (GstDnaBFL). However, we could not obtain crystals, perhaps due to the flexibility of the linker region connecting the middle and C-terminal domains. Hence, we generated a truncated version of the protein encompassing the N-terminal and middle domains (residues 1–300: GstDnaB1–300), which we previously showed to be functionally important for associations with PriA. A previous study also showed that BsuDnaB is truncated at its C terminus in a growth-phase–dependent manner (34Grainger W.H. Machón C. Scott D.J. Soultanas P. DnaB proteolysis in vivo regulates oligomerization and its localization at oriC in Bacillus subtilis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 2851-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These observations suggested to us that structural study of this portion of the protein (i.e. DnaB1–300) would have biological implications for its functional importance in primosome assembly. The crystal structure of GstDnaB1–300 was determined at 2.8 Å resolution via single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) phasing (Table 1). As expected, the GstDnaB1–300 monomer consisted of the N-terminal and middle domains connected by a long linker (Fig. 2A). The N-terminal domain (residues 3–144) was composed of three β-strands and eight α-helices, whereas the middle domain (residues 161–288) was composed of two β-strands and seven α-helices (Fig. 2, A and B). The three β-strands in the N-terminal domain were organized into a three-stranded β-sheet, in which β1 and β3 are parallel but β2 and β3 are antiparallel. In the middle domain, composed of seven helices (α9-α15) and two β-strands (β5 and β6), four α-helices (α11, α13, α14, and α15) were juxtaposed, and the two β-strands (β5 and β6) formed an antiparallel β-shee"
https://openalex.org/W2750005379,"Recent clinical cohort study shows that testosterone therapy increases cardiovascular diseases in men with low testosterone levels, excessive circulating androgen levels may play a detrimental role in the vascular system, while the potential mechanism and effect of testosterone exposure on the vascular function in offspring is still unknown. Our preliminary results showed that perinatal testosterone exposure in mice induces estrogen receptor β (ERβ) suppression in endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in offspring but not mothers, while estradiol (E2) had no effect. Further investigation showed that ERβ suppression is due to perinatal testosterone exposure-induced epigenetic changes with altered DNA methylation on the ERβ promoter. During aging, EPCs with ERβ suppression mobilize to the vascular wall, differentiate into ERβ-suppressed mouse endothelial cells (MECs) with downregulated expression of SOD2 (mitochondrial superoxide dismutase) and ERRα (estrogen-related receptor α). This results in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA damage, and the dysfunction of mitochondria and fatty acid metabolism, subsequently potentiating vascular dysfunction. Bone marrow transplantation of EPCs that overexpressed with either ERβ or a SIRT1 single mutant SIRT1-C152(D) that could modulate SIRT1 phosphorylation significantly ameliorated vascular dysfunction, while ERβ knockdown worsened the problem. We conclude that perinatal testosterone exposure potentiates vascular dysfunction through ERβ suppression in EPCs."
https://openalex.org/W2750523049,"Discrete choice experiments have been widely applied to elicit behavioral preferences in the literature. In many of these experiments, the alternatives are named alternatives, meaning that they are naturally associated with specific names. For example, in a mode choice study, the alternatives can be associated with names such as car, taxi, bus, and subway. A fundamental issue that arises in stated choice experiments is whether to treat the alternatives' names as labels (that is, labeled treatment), or as attributes (that is, unlabeled treatment) in the design as well as the presentation phases of the choice sets. In this research, we investigate the impact of labeled versus unlabeled treatments of alternatives' names on the outcome of stated choice experiments, a question that has not been thoroughly investigated in the literature. Using results from a mode choice study, we find that the labeled or the unlabeled treatment of alternatives' names in either the design or the presentation phase of the choice experiment does not statistically affect the estimates of the coefficient parameters. We then proceed to measure the influence toward the willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates. By using a random-effects model to relate the conditional WTP estimates to the socioeconomic characteristics of the individuals and the labeled versus unlabeled treatments of alternatives' names, we find that: a) Given the treatment of alternatives' names in the presentation phase, the treatment of alternatives' names in the design phase does not statistically affect the estimates of the WTP measures; and b) Given the treatment of alternatives' names in the design phase, the labeled treatment of alternatives' names in the presentation phase causes the corresponding WTP estimates to be slightly higher."

The rats were pretreated with an antagonist of the glucocorticoids (GCs) receptor RU486 (30 mg/kg, i.p.) 1 h prior to stress exposure. The behavioral changes were evaluated with open field test and elevated plus-maze test. The hippocampal cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 were measured on postoperative days 1, 3 and 7. Ionized calcium binding adaptor protein (Iba)-1, microglial M2 phenotype marker Arg1, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and CD200 were also examined at each time point.CUS exacerbated surgery-induced sickness behavior. Exposure to CUS alone failed to alter the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain. However, CUS exaggerated surgery-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines expression (e.g. IL-1β and IL-6) and upregulated the levels of Iba-1 on postoperative days 1 and 3. An additional significant decreased BDNF, CD200 and a lower level of Arg1 were also observed in the stressed rats following surgical procedure. Pretreatment with RU486 blunted the potentiating effects of CUS on surgery-induced sickness behavior and neuroinflammatory responses.Chronic unpredictable stress enhanced surgery-induced sickness behavior and neuroinflammatory responses. Stress-induced GCs played a pivotal role in enhancing surgery-induced neuroinflammatory processes by modulation of microglia functions."
https://openalex.org/W2748295223,"Background Advances in pharmaceuticals offer improved health outcomes for a wide range of illnesses, yet medicines are often inaccessible for many patients worldwide. One potential barrier to making medicines available to all is the cost of product registration, the fees for regulatory review and licensing for the sale of medicines beyond the cost of clinical trials, if needed. Methods and findings We performed a cross-sectional analysis of pharmaceutical registration fees in low-, middle-, and high-income countries. We collected data on market authorization fees for new chemical entities and for generic drugs in 95 countries. We calculated measures of registration fee size relative to population, gross domestic product (GDP), and total health spending in each country. Each of the 95 countries had a fee for registering new chemical entities. On average, the ratio of registration fees to GDP was highest in Europe and North America and lowest in South and Central America. Across individual countries, the level of registration fees was positively correlated with GDP and total health spending, with relatively few outliers. Discussion We find that, generally speaking, the regulatory fees charged by medicines regulatory authorities are roughly proportional to the market size in their jurisdictions. The data therefore do not support the hypothesis that regulatory fees are a barrier to market entry in most countries."

Overall, 26 children aged 3-4 years were selected out from all the children in the kindergarten to be involved in the present study, among them 13 were diagnosed as s-ECC and underwent dental treatment, whilst the other 13 were matched by age and sex as control. Stimulated whole saliva samples were collected before treatment, and at 10 days and 4 months after treatment. During follow-up, 7 of the 13 children with s-ECC showed a relapse, and the new carious lesions were then treated. Salivary peptides were detected using the technique of magnetic beads combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Fifteen peptides showed significant differences in the group without occurrence of new carious lesions (CH group). On comparing the CH group and the other group with occurrence of new carious lesions (CR group), no significant differences were observed before treatment, whereas certain peptides showed significant differences at both 10 days and 4 months after treatment. Two peptides (experimental m/z values: 3162.0 Da and 3290.4 Da) exhibited a consistent tendency in cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons among these groups; these may be associated with recurrence of s-ECC. Based on our findings, it is concluded that different saliva peptide peaks can be detected in s-ECC using MALDI-TOF MS combined with magnetic beads. Moreover, 2 specific peptides with m/z values 3162.0 Da and 3290.4 Da could be promising salivary protein biomarkers for diagnosis of recurrence of s-ECC."

However, the high dimension of the output of such technologies and the characteristics of the data sets analysed represent an issue for the classification task. Here we present a new feature selection method based on three steps to detect class-specific biomarkers in case of high-dimensional data sets. The first step detects the differentially expressed genes according to the experimental conditions tested in the experimental design, the second step filters out the features with low discriminative power and the third step detects the class-specific features and defines the final biomarker as the union of the class-specific features. The proposed procedure is tested on two microarray datasets, one characterized by a strong imbalance between the size of classes and the other one where the size of classes is perfectly balanced. We show that, using the proposed feature selection procedure, the classification performances of a Support Vector Machine on the imbalanced data set reach a 82% whereas other methods do not exceed 73%. Furthermore, in case of perfectly balanced dataset, the classification performances are comparable with other methods. Finally, the Gene Ontology enrichments performed on the signatures selected with the proposed pipeline, confirm the biological relevance of our methodology.

DEPSCREEN-INFO showed that a patient-targeted feedback in addition to screening results in lower depression level six months after screening. The purpose of this analysis was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of DEPSCREEN-INFO.Patients with coronary heart disease or arterial hypertension were included. Participants in both groups were screened for depression. Participants in the intervention group additionally received a patient-targeted feedback of their result and recommended treatment options. A cost-utility analysis using quality-adjusted life years (QALY) based on the EQ-5D was performed. The time horizon was 6 months. Resource utilization was assessed by a telephone interview. Multiple imputation using chained equations was used. Net-benefit regressions controlled for prognostic variables at baseline were performed to construct cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Different sensitivity analyses were performed.375 participants (intervention group: 155; control group: 220) were included at baseline. After 6 months, in the intervention group adjusted total costs were lower (-€2,098; SE: €1,717) and more QALY were gained (0.0067; SD: 0.0133); yet differences were not statistically significant. The probability of cost-effectiveness was around 80% independent of the willingness-to-pay (range: €0/QALY-€130,000/QALY). The results were robust.A patient-targeted feedback in addition to depression screening in cardiology is cost-effective with a high probability. This underpins the use of the patient-targeted feedbacks and the PHQ-9 that are both freely available and easy to implement in routine care."
https://openalex.org/W2613217610,"According to the competitive exclusion principle, in a finite ecosystem, extinction occurs naturally when two or more species compete for the same resources. An important question that arises is: when coexistence is not possible, which mechanisms confer an advantage to a given species against the other(s)? In general, it is expected that the species with the higher reproductive/death ratio will win the competition, but other mechanisms, such as asymmetry in interspecific competition or unequal diffusion rates, have been found to change this scenario dramatically. In this work, we examine competitive advantage in the context of quasi-neutral population models, including stochastic models with spatial structure as well as macroscopic (mean-field) descriptions. We employ a two-species contact process in which the ""biological clock"" of one species is a factor of α slower than that of the other species. Our results provide new insights into how stochasticity and competition interact to determine extinction in finite spatial systems. We find that a species with a slower biological clock has an advantage if resources are limited, winning the competition against a species with a faster clock, in relatively small systems. Periodic or stochastic environmental variations also favor the slower species, even in much larger systems."
https://openalex.org/W2744469265,"Background The phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase (PI3K), AKT and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal transduction pathway is frequently de-regulated and activated in human cancer and is an important therapeutic target. AZD8835 is a PI3K inhibitor, with selectivity against PI3K α and δ isoforms, which is currently in Phase 1 clinical trials. 18F-Fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) is a non-invasive pharmacodynamic imaging biomarker that has become an integral part of drug development. It has been used widely with PI3K inhibitors both clinically and pre-clinically because of the role of the PI3K pathway in glucose metabolism. In this study we investigated the potential of 18F-FDG PET as a non-invasive pharmacodynamic biomarker for AZD8835. We sought to understand if 18F-FDG PET could determine the minimally effective dose of AZD8835 and correlate with other pharmacodynamic biomarkers for validation of its use in clinical development. 18F-FDG PET scans were performed in nude mice in the BT474C breast xenograft model. Mice were fasted prior to imaging and static 18F-FDG PET was performed. Treatment groups received AZD8835 by oral gavage at a dose volume of 10ml/kg. Treatment groups received either 3, 6, 12.5, 25 or 50mg/kg AZD8835. Tumour growth was monitored throughout the study, and at the end of the imaging procedure, tumours were taken and a full pharmacodynamic analysis was performed. Results Results showed that AZD8835 reduced 18F-FDG uptake at a dose of 12.5, 25 and 50mg/kg with no significant reduction at doses of 3 and 6mg/kg. These results were consistent with other pharmacodynamics biomarkers measured and show 18F-FDG PET as a sensitive biomarker with the ability to determine the minimal effective dose of AZD8835. Conclusions Our pre-clinical studies support the use of 18F-FDG PET imaging as a sensitive and non- invasive pharmacodynamic biomarker (understanding the role of PI3K signalling in glucose uptake) for AZD8835 with a decrease in 18F-FDG uptake observed at only two hours post treatment. The decrease in 18F-FDG uptake was dose dependent and data showed excellent PK/PD correlation. This data supports and parallels observations obtained with this class of compounds in patients"
https://openalex.org/W2745561435,"Many alien species become invasive because they lack coevolutionary history with the native community; for instance, they may lack specialized enemies. These evolutionary advantages may allow the invader to establish and persist when rare within a community and lead to its monodominance through positive frequency dependence, i.e. increasing per capita population growth rate with increasing frequency of conspecifics. However, this advantage could degrade through time due to evolutionary and ecological changes in the invasive and native plant and microbial communities. We investigated survival rates and individual biomass as proxies for per capita population growth rates for the invasive grass, Microstegium vimineum, across a gradient of conspecific frequencies (10-100% relative cover of M. vimineum) within 12 sites that varied in time since invasion. We expected M. vimineum frequency dependence to become more negative and its proxies for population growth at low conspecific frequency to decline across invasion history. We also explored the belowground fungal community associated with M. vimineum, since we hypothesized that changes in M. vimineum population dynamics may result from shifting microbial interactions over time. Microstegium vimineum frequency dependence changed from negative to neutral across invasion history and the shift was driven by a decline in survival at low frequency. Changes in M. vimineum root fungal community were associated with time since invasion. Our results do not support a shift in frequency dependence from positive to negative across invasion history. However, our results suggest M. vimineum populations may be less prone to persist at older invaded sites and thus more vulnerable to management intervention."

Meanwhile, identity-based identification and signature (IBI/IBS) schemes are two of the most fundamental cryptographic primitives, so several code-based IBI/IBS schemes have been proposed. However, with increasingly profound researches on coding theory, the security reduction and efficiency of such schemes have been invalidated and challenged. In this paper, we construct provably secure IBI/IBS schemes from code assumptions against impersonation under active and concurrent attacks through a provably secure code-based signature technique proposed by Preetha, Vasant and Rangan (PVR signature), and a security enhancement Or-proof technique. We also present the parallel-PVR technique to decrease parameter values while maintaining the standard security level. Compared to other code-based IBI/IBS schemes, our schemes achieve not only preferable public parameter size, private key size, communication cost and signature length due to better parameter choices, but also provably secure."

However, some studies show that this benefit is uncertain in patients with renal dysfunction, and the role of statins is based on the severity of renal dysfunction. In this study, we investigated the impact of statin therapy on major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and all-cause mortality in patients with advanced renal dysfunction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) after AMI.This study was based on the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry database. We included 861 patients with advanced renal dysfunction from among 33,205 patients who underwent PCI after AMI between November 2005 and July 2012. Patients were divided into two groups: a statin group (n = 537) and a no-statin group (n = 324). We investigated the 12-month MACEs (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, repeated PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting) and all-cause mortality of each group. Subsequently, a propensity score-matched analysis was performed.In the total population studied, no significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to the rate of recurrent MI, repeated PCI, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), or all-cause mortality. However, the cardiac death rate was significantly lower in the statin group (p = 0.009). Propensity score-matched analysis yielded 274 pairs demonstrating, results similar to those obtained from the total population. However, there was no significant difference in the cardiac death rate in the propensity score-matched population (p = 0.103). Cox-regression analysis revealed only left ventricular ejection fraction to be an independent predictor of 12-month MACEs (Hazard ratio [HR] of 0.979, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0962-0.996, p = 0.018).Statin therapy was not significantly associated with a reduction in the 12-month MACEs or all-cause mortality in patients with advanced renal dysfunction undergoing PCI after AMI."
https://openalex.org/W2748516817,"Eukaryotic class I ribonucleotide reductases (RRs) generate deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis. Binding of dNTP effectors is coupled to the formation of active dimers and induces conformational changes in a short loop (loop 2) to regulate RR specificity among its nucleoside diphosphate substrates. Moreover, ATP and dATP bind at an additional allosteric site 40 A away from loop 2 and thereby drive formation of activated or inactive hexamers, respectively. To better understand how dNTP binding influences specificity, activity, and oligomerization of human RR, we aligned >300 eukaryotic RR sequences to examine natural sequence variation in loop 2. We found that most amino acids in eukaryotic loop 2 were nearly invariant in this sample; however, two positions co-varied as nonconservative substitutions (N291G and P294K; human numbering). We also found that the individual N291G and P294K substitutions in human RR additively affect substrate specificity. The P294K substitution significantly impaired effector-induced oligomerization required for enzyme activity, and oligomerization was rescued in the N291G/P294K enzyme. None of the other mutants exhibited altered ATP-mediated hexamerization; however, certain combinations of loop 2 mutations and dNTP effectors perturbed ATP's role as an allosteric activator. Our results demonstrate that the observed compensatory covariation of amino acids in eukaryotic loop 2 is essential for its role in dNTP-induced dimerization. In contrast, defects in substrate specificity are not rescued in the double mutant, implying that functional sequence variation elsewhere in the protein is necessary. These findings yield insight into loop 2's roles in regulating RR specificity, allostery, and oligomerization."

Besides, cooperation on scale-free networks is enhanced with the increase of interaction degree regardless whether the interaction is high-degree preference or random. If the interaction degree is very low, the cooperation level on scale-free networks is much lower than that on regular ring networks, which is against the common belief that scale-free networks must be more beneficial for cooperation. Our analysis indicates that the interaction relations, the strategy and the game payoff of high-connectivity players play important roles in the evolution of cooperation on scale-free networks. A certain number of interactions are necessary for scale-free networks to exhibit strong capability of facilitating cooperation. Our work provides important insight for members on how to interact with others in a social organization."
https://openalex.org/W2749747634,"Protecting key hotspots of marine biodiversity is essential to maintain ecosystem services at large spatial scales. Protected areas serve not only as sources of propagules colonizing other habitats, but also as receptors, thus acting as protected nurseries. To quantify the geographical extent and the temporal persistence of ecological benefits resulting from protection, we investigate larval connectivity within a remote archipelago, characterized by a strong spatial gradient of human impact from pristine to heavily exploited: the Northern Line Islands (NLIs), including part of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument (PRI-MNM). Larvae are described as passive Lagrangian particles transported by oceanic currents obtained from a oceanographic reanalysis. We compare different simulation schemes and compute connectivity measures (larval exchange probabilities and minimum/average larval dispersal distances from target islands). To explore the role of PRI-MNM in protecting marine organisms with pelagic larval stages, we drive millions of individual-based simulations for various Pelagic Larval Durations (PLDs), in all release seasons, and over a two-decades time horizon (1991-2010). We find that connectivity in the NLIs is spatially asymmetric and displays significant intra- and inter-annual variations. The islands belonging to PRI-MNM act more as sinks than sources of larvae, and connectivity is higher during the winter-spring period. In multi-annual analyses, yearly averaged southward connectivity significantly and negatively correlates with climatological anomalies (El Niño). This points out a possible system fragility and susceptibility to global warming. Quantitative assessments of large-scale, long-term marine connectivity patterns help understand region-specific, ecologically relevant interactions between islands. This is fundamental for devising scientifically-based protection strategies, which must be space- and time-varying to cope with the challenges posed by the concurrent pressures of human exploitation and global climate change."
