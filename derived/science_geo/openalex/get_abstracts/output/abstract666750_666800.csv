https://openalex.org/W3117551966,"ApoE4, a strong genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease, has been associated with increased risk for severe COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether ApoE4 alters COVID-19 susceptibility or severity, and the role of direct viral infection in brain cells remains obscure. We tested the neurotropism of SARS-CoV2 in human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) models and observed low-grade infection of neurons and astrocytes that is boosted in neuron-astrocyte co-cultures and organoids. We then generated isogenic ApoE3/3 and ApoE4/4 hiPSCs and found an increased rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ApoE4/4 neurons and astrocytes. ApoE4 astrocytes exhibited enlarged size and elevated nuclear fragmentation upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we show that remdesivir treatment inhibits SARS-CoV2 infection of hiPSC neurons and astrocytes. These findings suggest that ApoE4 may play a causal role in COVID-19 severity. Understanding how risk factors impact COVID-19 susceptibility and severity will help us understand the potential long-term effects in different patient populations."

However, in organ failure, cancer, and chronic inflammatory disorders such as atopic dermatitis (AD), itch becomes chronic, intractable, and debilitating. In addition to chronic itch, patients often experience intense acute itch exacerbations. Recent discoveries have unearthed the neuroimmune circuitry of itch, leading to the development of anti-itch treatments. However, mechanisms underlying acute itch exacerbations remain overlooked. Herein, we identify that a large proportion of patients with AD harbor allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and exhibit a propensity for acute itch flares. In mice, while allergen-provoked acute itch is mediated by the mast cell-histamine axis in steady state, AD-associated inflammation renders this pathway dispensable. Instead, a previously unrecognized basophil-leukotriene (LT) axis emerges as critical for acute itch flares.

Itch (i.e., pruritus) is defined as an uncomfortable sensation on the skin that causes a desire to scratch. When acute, itch is a protective mechanism to rapidly expel noxious environmental stimuli. However, itch can become chronic and pathologic in nature, underlying a variety of medical conditions that range from inflammatory skin disorders to chronic kidney disease and cancer (Larson et al., 2019Larson V.A.

Chronic itch is clinically defined in humans as itch that lasts for greater than 6 weeks (Kim et al., 2019Kim B.S. Berger T.G. Yosipovitch G.

Notably, chronic itch often persists for years due to the lack of effective therapeutics and can profoundly affect quality of life of patients (Altınok Ersoy and Akyar, 2019Altınok Ersoy N. Akyar İ.

In recent years, the morbidity of chronic itch has been increasingly recognized and clinical trials now routinely measure itch as a key endpoint (Fishbane et al., 2020Fishbane S. Jamal A. Munera C.

However, current assessments quantify itch severity as an aggregate score over time (Erickson and Kim, 2019Erickson S. Kim B.S. Research Techniques Made Simple: Itch Measurement in Clinical Trials.J.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a pruritic inflammatory skin disease with a chronic but relapsing course. Although chronic itch is a well-defined feature of AD, patients also report experiencing sudden itch flares, which remain poorly characterized (Chang et al., 2016Chang A. Robison R. Cai M. Singh A.M.

Birch pollen-related foods can cause late eczematous reactions in patients with atopic dermatitis.Allergy. 2018; 73: 2046-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Recent advances in neuroimmunology have demonstrated that effector cytokines associated with AD such as interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-13, and IL-31 can directly stimulate sensory neurons to promote chronic itch (Cevikbas et al., 2014Cevikbas F. Wang X. Akiyama T. Kempkes C. Savinko T. Antal A. Kukova G. Buhl T. Ikoma A.

Whether acute itch flares simply represent enhanced signaling of these known pathways or use other molecular circuits remains unknown. Characterized by scaly, leaky, and oozing skin, patients with AD become epicutaneously sensitized to environmental allergens and thus harbor allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) (Spergel and Paller, 2003Spergel J.M.

Although the acquisition of allergen-specific IgE predisposes patients with AD to develop other atopic disorders such as asthma and food allergy (Brough et al., 2015Brough H.A. Liu A.H. Sicherer S.

Development of allergies and asthma in infants and young children with atopic dermatitis--a prospective follow-up to 7 years of age.Allergy. 2000; 55: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), the role of IgE in AD pathogenesis has remained surprisingly elusive (Ogawa et al., 2016Ogawa Y. Kono M. Tsujikawa M. Tsujiuchi H. Akiyama M. IgE-independent pathophysiology of severe atopic dermatitis demonstrated in an IgE-deficient patient.J. Dermatol. Sci. 2016; 82: 139-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Even in murine models of AD that are induced by model allergens, cutaneous inflammation occurs independently of IgE (Spergel et al., 1999Spergel J.M. Mizoguchi E. Oettgen H. Bhan A.K. Geha R.S. Roles of TH1 and TH2 cytokines in a murine model of allergic dermatitis.J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1103-1111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, anti-IgE therapy has produced mixed results and has not advanced beyond phase 2 clinical trials in human AD, for which trial endpoints are primarily focused on skin inflammation and not itch (Deleanu and Nedelea, 2019Deleanu D. Nedelea I. Biological therapies for atopic dermatitis: An update.Exp. Ther. Med. 2019; 17: 1061-1067PubMed Google Scholar; Heil et al., 2010Heil P.M. Maurer D. Klein B. Hultsch T. Stingl G.

Ges. 2010; 8: 990-998PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, several studies have demonstrated that patients with AD have seasonal variation of itch symptoms (Kim et al., 2017Kim M. Kim Y.M. Lee J.Y.

Therefore, we hypothesized that IgE may represent a key mechanism that drives acute itch flares in response to allergens in the context of AD.

Allergen recognition by IgE bound to the high-affinity receptor FcεRI results in IgE crosslinking and triggers the release of a variety of effector molecules such as histamine and serotonin (Benditt et al., 1955Benditt E.P.

These mediators in turn can activate sensory neurons to provoke neuroinflammation and itch sensation (Wang et al., 2020Wang F. Yang T.B. Kim B.S. The Return of the Mast Cell: New Roles in Neuroimmune Itch Biology.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2020; 140: 945-951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Indeed, histamine was one of the first factors identified to elicit itch through its direct stimulation of sensory neurons (i.e., to act as a pruritogen), and it is now recognized as a canonical mediator of acute itch (Dale and Laidlaw, 1910Dale H.H. Laidlaw P.P. The physiological action of beta-iminazolylethylamine.J. Physiol. 1910; 41: 318-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Weisshaar et al., 1997Weisshaar E. Ziethen B. Gollnick H.

However, antihistamines have demonstrated poor efficacy in most chronic itch disorders, including AD (He et al., 2018He A. Feldman S.R. Fleischer Jr., A.B.

Dermatol. 2018; 79: 92-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar; Rajagopalan et al., 2017Rajagopalan M. Saraswat A. Godse K. Shankar D.S. Kandhari S. Shenoi S.D. Tahiliani S. Zawar V.V. Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Pruritus: An Expert Consensus Review.Indian J. Dermatol. 2017; 62: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In the current study, we examined clinical itch datasets from phase 3 clinical trials for moderate-to-severe AD and found that a large proportion of patients exhibit acute itch flares that would not be captured in traditional analyses. Furthermore, we identified that patients with allergen-specific IgE have a higher likelihood of exhibiting acute itch flares than those without allergen-specific IgE, provoking the hypothesis that allergen exposure is a factor that drives acute itch flares. To investigate this, we generated a murine model of AD-like disease in which challenge with a model allergen elicits acute itch flares. Although dependent on IgE, acute itch flares surprisingly occurred independently of tissue-resident mast cells, but they were critically dependent on basophils. Strikingly, chemogenetic activation of basophils alone was sufficient to provoke itch-induced scratching behavior in mice. Intravital imaging further demonstrated basophil-sensory neuron interactions following cutaneous allergen exposure. Moreover, allergen-stimulated basophils exhibited enhanced production of leukotriene (LT) C4. The presence of cysteinyl LT receptor 2 (CysLTR2) on neurons, a receptor for LTC4, was critically required for acute itch flares in AD-associated inflammation. Collectively, our study unveils a form of acute itch flare that emerges in the context of chronic skin inflammation to activate a non-canonical basophil-neuronal circuit. Importantly, we highlight how itch manifests heterogeneously even within one disease. Although patients suffering from chronic itch can experience acute periods of intense itch exacerbation (Fourzali et al., 2020Fourzali K.M. Golpanian R.S. Chan Y.H. Yosipovitch G.

Williams H.C. What is meant by a “flare” in atopic dermatitis? A systematic review and proposal.Arch. Dermatol. 2006; 142: 1190-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), this phenomenon remains poorly characterized. To study AD-associated acute itch flares, we performed a post hoc analysis on two phase 3 clinical trials for moderate-to-severe AD (Simpson et al., 2016Simpson E.L. Bieber T. Guttman-Yassky E. Beck L.A. Blauvelt A. Cork M.J. Silverberg J.I. Deleuran M. Kataoka Y. Lacour J.P. et al.SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 InvestigatorsTwo Phase 3 Trials of Dupilumab versus Placebo in Atopic Dermatitis.N. Engl. J. Med. 2016; 375: 2335-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). We assessed the daily numerical rating scale (NRS) itch scores from placebo-treated patients (N = 159) over a 2-month period (Figure 1A). The NRS itch score is a single-item self-assessment wherein patients rate their severity of itch from 0 (“no itch”) to 10 (“worst imaginable itch”) over the prior 24 h (Phan et al., 2012Phan N.Q. Blome C. Fritz F. Gerss J. Reich A. Ebata T. Augustin M. Szepietowski J.C. Ständer S. Assessment of pruritus intensity: prospective study on validity and reliability of the visual analogue scale, numerical rating scale and verbal rating scale in 471 patients with chronic pruritus.Acta Derm. Venereol. 2012; 92: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). While some patients exhibited consistent itch severity over the assessment period, others exhibited a fluctuating itch pattern with rapid and frequent spikes of itch (Figure 1B). We classified patients as having an acute itch flare if there was an elevation in their daily NRS itch score of ≥2 points relative to their baseline (day 0) within a 3-day period (Langan et al., 2006Langan S.M. Thomas K.S. Williams H.C. What is meant by a “flare” in atopic dermatitis? A systematic review and proposal.Arch. Dermatol. 2006; 142: 1190-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). During the first month, 26.4% of the patients (42/159) exhibited acute itch flares (Figure 1C). In the second month, interestingly, N = 5 patients (5/159, 3.1%) lost their acute itch phenotype, while N = 32 patients (32/159, 20.1%), who previously exhibited a non-flare pattern, developed acute itch flares (Figure 1D). Overall, 46.5% of patients with AD (74/159) presented with acute itch flares during the course of the 2-month period (Figures 1C and 1D). Collectively, our data demonstrate that acute itch flares are exhibited by a large proportion of patients with AD. However, what factors drive these periodic itch exacerbations remain unclear. Prior studies have found that allergens provoke itch in AD (Jaworek et al., 2020Jaworek A.K. Szafraniec K. Jaworek M. Doniec Z. Zalewski A. Kurzawa R. Wojas-Pelc A. Pokorski M.

Immunol. 2015; 136: 96-103.e9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the majority of patients with AD harbor allergen-specific IgE (Flohr et al., 2004Flohr C. Johansson S.G. Wahlgren C.F. Williams H. How atopic is atopic dermatitis?.J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2004; 114: 150-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To investigate whether reactivity to allergens is linked to acute itch flares, we retrospectively profiled the serum allergen-specific IgE repertoire from our cohort of N = 159 patients (Figure 1A). We separated patients into those who harbor allergen-specific IgE (N = 133 patients, 83.6%) and those who do not (N = 26 patients, 16.4%). Strikingly, a higher frequency of patients with allergen-specific IgE (68/133, 51.1%) experienced acute itch flares than those without allergen-specific IgE (6/26, 23.1%) (Figure 1E). Taken together, these findings indicate that the presence of allergen-specific IgE is likely associated with acute itch flares in AD, provoking the hypothesis that allergen exposure might be a factor that drives acute itch flares. To test whether allergen recognition by IgE promotes acute itch flares in the setting of AD-associated inflammation, we generated a murine model of acute itch flares. We induced AD-like disease by topically treating mice on both ears with the irritant calcipotriol (MC903) daily for 10 days. Concurrently with MC903, the model allergen ovalbumin (OVA) was also topically applied onto the ear skin in order to mirror epicutaneous allergen sensitization (Figures 1F and S1A) that occurs in patients (Han et al., 2017Han H.

After 10 days, MC903 + OVA-treated wild-type (WT) mice developed robust AD-like skin inflammation (Figures S1B and S1C), allergen (OVA)-specific IgE (Figure 1G), and chronic spontaneous itch (∼60 bouts/10 min) (Figure 1H, blue line, open and closed squares). This was in contrast to WT mice that received the control treatment of ethanol vehicle and OVA (EtOH + OVA), which lacked skin inflammation (Figures S1B and S1C), OVA-specific IgE (Figure 1G), and chronic spontaneous itch behavior (∼5 bouts/10 min) over the same interval (Figure 1H, blue line, open circle). Upon intradermal (i.d.) injection of OVA into the adjacent non-lesional cheek skin of mice with AD-associated inflammation (Figure 1F), an acute itch flare was immediately observed (∼200 bouts/10 min) and resolved over the subsequent 30 min (Figure 1H, red line, closed square). However, this acute itch flare phenomenon was absent in EtOH + OVA-treated control mice i.d. challenged with OVA (Figure 1H, red line, open circle) and in mice with AD-associated inflammation that were i.d. challenged with an irrelevant allergen, bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Figure 1H, red line, open square). As expected, IgE was required for acute itch flares as IgE-deficient (Ige−/−) mice failed to generate a response to i.d. OVA challenge, while IgE was dispensable for chronic spontaneous itch (Figure 1I). These studies demonstrate that acute itch flares triggered by allergen exposure are dependent on IgE in the context of AD. Mast cell degranulation"

While spliceosome modulators are known to induce transcriptome-wide mis-splicing, previous work has focused on mis-splicing of specific genes to explain tumor cell death and other phenotypes associated with splicing perturbation. For instance, cell-cycle arrest phenotypes have been attributed to mis-splicing of genes encoding cell-cycle regulators such as p27 (Kaida et al., 2007Kaida D. Motoyoshi H. Tashiro E. Nojima T.

These important studies highlight the impact of individual mis-spliced mRNAs and their encoded proteins but also emphasize that culprit mis-spliced genes may vary widely across individual tumors and their diverse transcriptomes. This leaves open the question of whether there are more generalized pathways that govern tumor cell response to spliceosome-targeted therapies (STTs), especially in tumor types that exhibit heightened dependency on RNA splicing. The current study reveals that mis-spliced mRNAs themselves are a class of macromolecules that are sensed upon spliceosome inhibition, triggering an antiviral immune response and TNBC cell death. We show that STTs cause widespread accumulation of intron-containing transcripts and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the cytoplasm of TNBC cells. These endogenous intron-containing dsRNAs trigger an antiviral immune response via multiple dsRNA binding proteins, including those that activate the signaling integrator MAVS. Notably, STTs trigger both tumor cell-intrinsic antiviral signaling and adaptive immune signaling in animal models of breast cancer. Moreover, intrinsic defects in RNA splicing in primary human breast malignancies correlate with evidence of immune engagement and associate with improved disease-free survival in breast cancer patients. These findings point to dysregulated splicing as an unanticipated approach by which to trigger tumor-intrinsic dsRNA antiviral signaling and provide mechanistic insight to explain, in part, the selective anti-cancer activity of STTs. Previous studies have demonstrated that MYC-driven cancers such as TNBC are sensitive to partial pharmacologic and genetic perturbation of the spliceosome (Hsu et al., 2015Hsu T.Y.-T. Simon L.M. Neill N.J. Marcotte R. Sayad A. Bland C.S. Echeverria G.V. Sun T. Kurley S.J.

However, the pathways that are activated by and coordinate cell-fate decision making in response to spliceosome inhibition are largely unknown. We integrated two unbiased approaches—gene-expression analysis and forward genetic screening—to investigate these pathways. First, we characterized the transcriptional changes of two MYC-driven TNBC cell lines, SUM159 and MDA-MB-231-LM2 (LM2) (Kessler et al., 2012Kessler J.D. Kahle K.T. Sun T. Meerbrey K.L. Schlabach M.R.

Palacios G. Goronga T. Freeman B. Caufield W. Webb T.R. Optimization of antitumor modulators of pre-mRNA splicing.J. Med.

USA. 2005; 102: 15545-15550Crossref PubMed Scopus (17346) Google Scholar) revealed that transcriptional changes in response to spliceosome inhibition were highly correlated between the two cell lines (Figure 1B), suggesting that a common set of cellular pathways may respond to acute splicing perturbation. Consistent with previous reports, cell-cycle and RNA-processing pathways were downregulated in response to spliceosome inhibition (Hsu et al., 2015Hsu T.Y.-T. Simon L.M. Neill N.J. Marcotte R.

Surprisingly, immune signaling pathways, including interferon (IFN) alpha and beta signaling, were among the most significant positively enriched pathways (Figure 1C). Upregulation of both IFN-stimulated genes (e.g., OAS1, MX1) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-responsive genes (e.g., TNF, IL1B) indicate activation of an antiviral transcriptional program in response to spliceosome inhibition (Figure 1D). Induction of IFNB expression preceded the expression of well-characterized IFN-responsive genes, suggesting activation of IFN-responsive antiviral signaling (Figure S1A). These results are not unique to SD6, as treatment of SUM159 and LM2 cells with H3B-8800 (Seiler et al., 2018bSeiler M. Yoshimi A. Darman R. Chan B. Keaney G. Thomas M. Agrawal A.A. Caleb B. Csibi A.

Med. 2018; 24: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), a structurally distinct spliceosome modulator currently in clinical trials (NCT02841540), resulted in similar upregulation of an antiviral transcriptional program of mRNAs (Figure 1E; Figures S1B and S1C) and secretion of their encoded proteins (Figure 1F). Together, these data support the model that inhibition of splicing induces an antiviral immune transcriptional response.Figure S1Spliceosome-targeted therapies activate antiviral signaling, related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Spliceosome inhibition induces IFNB transcription followed by induction of interferon-stimulated genes.

Notably, H3B-8800 induced antiviral transcriptional programs in MYC-driven TNBC cells to a much greater extent than non-transformed mammary epithelial cells (Figure 1E). Given that MYC hyperactivation has been shown to increase sensitivity to spliceosome inhibition, we asked whether MYC hyperactivation alone is sufficient to prime activation of such antiviral programs upon spliceosome inhibition using human mammary epithelial cells engineered with inducible MYC-ER transgene (MYC-ER HME1) (Hsu et al., 2015Hsu T.Y.-T. Simon L.M. Neill N.J. Marcotte R. Sayad A. Bland C.S. Echeverria G.V. Sun T. Kurley S.J.

Hartman Z.C. et al.A SUMOylation-Dependent Transcriptional Subprogram Is Required for Myc-Driven Tumorigenesis.Science. 2012; 335: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the combination of MYC hyperactivation and H3B-8800 treatment induced robust activation of antiviral signaling programs (Figures 1G and 1H), but the individual perturbations did not, strongly suggesting that oncogenic MYC can prime antiviral immune response to spliceosome inhibition. To confirm that activation of antiviral transcriptional signaling was due to on-target inhibition of spliceosome activity, we evaluated the effects of chemical-genetic depletion of SF3B1, the protein target of SD6 and H3B-8800. Expression of SF3B1-FKBP12F36V in SUM159 cells with knockout of endogenous SF3B1 enabled selective and dose-dependent perturbation of SF3B1 function (Figure S1D; Nabet et al., 2018Nabet B. Roberts J.M. Buckley D.L. Paulk J. Dastjerdi S. Yang A. Leggett A.L. Erb M.A. Lawlor M.A. Souza A. et al.The dTAG system for immediate and target-specific protein degradation.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2018; 14: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Similar to treatment with STTs, degradation of SF3B1-FKBP12F36V induced expression of IFN and NF-κB-responsive genes (Figures 1I and 1J). From these data, we conclude that spliceosome perturbation induces an antiviral transcriptional response in MYC-driven TNBCs. Second, we sought to identify genes required for sensitivity to spliceosome inhibition in TNBC cells. We performed a forward genetic screen with a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library (18,370 shRNAs targeting 1,837 genes) targeting signal transducing protein classes (kinases, phosphatases, and ubiquitin ligases). SUM159 cells transduced with the retroviral shRNA library were grown in the presence or absence of SD6 (Figure 2A). The shRNA abundance in tumor cell genomic DNA was quantified in initial and treated samples by sequencing. We focused our downstream analysis on shRNAs that increased in abundance specifically in the SD6-treated state, referred to as “resistance candidates” because candidate knockdown conferred resistance to spliceosome inhibition (Table S1). MeSH term enrichment analysis (Yu, 2018Yu G. Using meshes for MeSH term enrichment and semantic analyses.Bioinformatics. 2018; 34: 3766-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) of the top 50 resistance candidates revealed a cluster of genes involved in immune response (Figure 2B; Table S2), suggesting that immune pathways may regulate tumor cell response to spliceosome-targeted therapies (STTs). StringDB analysis of resistance candidates revealed enrichment of pathways related to immunity and regulation of signaling downstream of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing (Figure S2A). Notably, 5 of the top 30 resistance candidates were documented modulators of dsRNA-sensing pathways (Figure S2B) (Arimoto et al., 2007Arimoto K. Takahashi H. Hishiki T. Konishi H. Fujita T.

Pluripotent embryonic stem cells (PSCs) possess a unique set of metabolic programs and epigenetic states to sustain their unlimited proliferation while maintaining their pluripotency (Folmes et al., 2012Folmes C.D.

For instance, PSCs demand high glycolysis-mediated, glucose-dependent production of acetyl-CoA and histone acetylation for maintenance of pluripotency (Moussaieff et al., 2015Moussaieff A. Rouleau M. Kitsberg D. Cohen M. Levy G. Barasch D. Nemirovski A. Shen-Orr S. Laevsky I.

Differentiation of PSCs to mesoderm and endoderm triggers a metabolic switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation (Cliff et al., 2017Cliff T.S. Wu T. Boward B.R. Yin A. Yin H. Glushka J.N.

This metabolic switch is believed to be important to release stem cells from pluripotency and promote differentiation because inhibition of glycolytic metabolism has been shown to lead to loss of histone acetylation and the pluripotent state (Gu et al., 2016Gu W. Gaeta X. Sahakyan A. Chan A.B. Hong C.S. Kim R. Braas D. Plath K. Lowry W.E. Christofk H.R.

However, whether and how the increase in oxidative phosphorylation during this metabolic remodeling actively affects this early-stage differentiation is still unclear. Over the past decade, a panel of short-chain and long-chain lysine acylations have been identified by high-sensitivity mass spectrometry as novel histone post-translational modifications (Rousseaux and Khochbin, 2015Rousseaux S.

Compared with histone acetylation, these lysine acylations are mediated by intermediate metabolites from different metabolic pathways, pose distinct genomic distributions, display diverse affinities to various modifiers (e.g., writers, erasers, and readers), and have a greater ability to activate gene expression (Sabari et al., 2017Sabari B.R.

For example, histone crotonylation, one of the first discovered non-acetyl histone lysine acylations, is derived from crotonyl-CoA, an intermediate metabolite during mitochondrial or peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation as well as lysine and tryptophan metabolism (Figures 1A and S1A). Experimental, genetic, and environmental perturbations that alter cellular concentrations of crotonyl-CoA, including incubation of nuclear extracts with crotonyl-CoA (Simithy et al., 2017Simithy J.

However, physiological outcomes associated with histone crotonylation remain largely unknown. In the present study, we assessed the effect of histone crotonylation on lineage commitment of PSCs and early embryogenesis. Given the observation that crotonyl-CoA is primarily generated from oxidation of fatty acids and amino acids (Figure 1A and S1A), we hypothesized that crotonyl-CoA production, and therefore histone crotonylation, is increased during the metabolic switch in the early differentiation of PSCs and that this increase is important for lineage commitment of these cells. Crotonyl-CoA is an endogenous intermediate metabolite during fatty acid oxidation and lysine/tryptophan degradation (Figures 1A and S1A). To test our hypothesis that crotonyl-CoA production and histone crotonylation are increased during metabolic remodeling in early differentiation of PSCs, we first analyzed the expression of key crotonyl-CoA-producing enzymes during in vitro differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into three primary germ layers (Figures S1B and S2A). As shown in Figures 1B and S2B, the mRNA levels of ACSS2 as well as two additional enzymes that catalyze conversion of butyryl-CoA to crotonyl-CoA during fatty acid oxidation (a mitochondrial short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, ACADS, and a peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase, ACOX3) were induced significantly upon endoderm and/or mesoderm differentiation but not after ectoderm differentiation of mel1 hESCs in vitro, suggesting that differentiation of endoderm and mesoderm, but not ectoderm, is associated with increased crotonyl-CoA production. This observation is consistent with a recent report that the glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation metabolic switch occurs only during mesoderm and endoderm differentiation but not during ectoderm differentiation of hESCs (Cliff et al., 2017Cliff T.S. Wu T. Boward B.R. Yin A. Yin H. Glushka J.N. Prestegaard J.H. Dalton S. MYC Controls Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Fate Decisions through Regulation of Metabolic Flux.Cell Stem Cell. 2017; 21: 502-516.e9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analysis in embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) mouse embryos further showed that one crotonyl-CoA-producing enzyme, ACSS2, was specifically enriched in SOX17-positive visceral endodermal cells (Figure 1C), suggesting that endoderm is the major germ layer targeted for possible regulation by crotonylation in mice. As a control, factors involved in acetyl-CoA production and transport (Moussaieff et al., 2015Moussaieff A. Rouleau M. Kitsberg D. Cohen M. Levy G. Barasch D. Nemirovski A. Shen-Orr S. Laevsky I. Amit M. et al.Glycolysis-mediated changes in acetyl-CoA and histone acetylation control the early differentiation of embryonic stem cells.Cell Metab. 2015; 21: 392-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) were not significantly induced during endoderm differentiation of hESCs (Figure S2C), suggesting that endoderm differentiation is specifically associated with increased crotonyl-CoA but not altered acetyl-CoA production. Further immunofluorescence staining analyses in hESCs and differentiated endodermal cells confirmed that expression of ACSS2, ACADS, and ACOX3 was induced upon endoderm differentiation of mel1 hESCs (Figure 1D, green) and H9 hESCs (Figure S2D, green). Intriguingly, significant fractions of these crotonyl-CoA-producing enzymes were localized to the nucleus, particularly in endodermal cells (Figures 1D, S2D, and S2E), suggesting a nuclear role of these enzymes in endodermal cells. Our findings indicate that endoderm differentiation is specifically associated with increased expression of crotonyl-CoA-producing enzymes in cultured cells and in vivo. We next analyzed whether the observed increase in expression of crotonyl-CoA-producing enzymes during endoderm differentiation is accompanied by increased histone crotonylation. Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) was enhanced dramatically in the nucleus of mel1 hESCs after 3-day differentiation into endodermal cells, as detected by a previously used and well-characterized rabbit polyclonal pan-anti-Kcr antibody, PTM-501 (Figure 2A, left panels, Kcr (501), Day 3 endodermal cells [D3 Endo] versus embryonic stem cells [ESCs]; Sabari et al., 2015Sabari B.R.

In contrast, lysine butyrylation (Kbu), a structurally similar lysine acylation, displayed comparable levels in ESCs and D3 endodermal cells, as detected by a rabbit polyclonal pan-anti-Kbu antibody (Figure 2A, right panels). These observations suggest that Kcr is specifically induced during endoderm differentiation. We confirmed that all three pan-antibodies have the desired specificity to distinguish Kcr and Kbu modifications in the immunofluorescence staining assay by peptide competition experiments (Figure S3A). Further immunoblot analysis revealed that all three antibodies predominantly detect crotonylation or butyrylation signals on histones (Figures S3B–S3D), and Kcr(502) and Kbu antibodies also have adequate specificity in the immunoblot assay (Figures S3C and S3D). To further confirm that Kcr is increased during endoderm differentiation of hESCs, we quantified histone Kcr levels in endodermal cells differentiated from mel1 hESCs and compared them with those in mel1 hESCs using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomics analysis (Table S1; Figure 2B). This analysis revealed that 2 of 3 detectable histone Kcr sites, H4K77cr and H4K91cr, were found only in the differentiated endodermal cells compared with hESCs (Figure 2B; Table S1, Kcr). Again, the levels of distinct histone lysine acetylation (Kac) and Kbu sites were differentially altered after endoderm differentiation (Table S1, Kac and Kbu), indicating that histone Kcr is specifically induced upon endoderm differentiation of hESCs. Notably, SILAC analysis also revealed that Kac and Kbu could be increased on histone tails and cores upon endoderm differentiation, but Kcr was primarily detected and induced on histone globular cores on the nucleosome lateral surface (H4K77) or on the histone-histone interface (H4K91) (Figure 2B; Table S1), suggesting a specific function of Kcr in modulating DNA/nucleosome interaction and nucleosome dynamics and stability (Bowman and Poirier, 2015Bowman G.D.

Germline monoallelic missense mutations affecting H4K91 have been reported recently to cause a developmental syndrome in humans (Tessadori et al., 2017Tessadori F. Giltay J.C. Hurst J.A. Massink M.P. Duran K. Vos H.R. van Es R.M. Scott R.H. van Gassen K.L.I. Bakkers J. van Haaften G.

Genet. 2017; 49: 1642-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our further mutagenesis study showed that mutation of K to R, which abolishes the possible crotonylation modification on K77 or K91 of H4, significantly reduced the fraction of SOX17-positive endodermal cells when highly expressed in WT D2 endodermal cells (Figures 2C, 2D, and S3E), indicating that acylation on both sites is important for endoderm differentiation. In line with these observations in cultured cells, Kcr was also enriched in the SOX17-positive endodermal cells in the mouse E7 embryo (Figure 2E). Intriguingly, compared with a ubiquitous distribution pattern of H3K27ac, an enhancer mark that has been shown previously to prime poised enhancers, increasing the response of endodermal intermediates to inductive signals (Wang et al., 2015Wang A. Yue F. Li Y. Xie R. Harper T. Patel N.A. Muth K. Palmer J. Qiu Y. Wang J. et al.Epigenetic priming of enhancers predicts developmental competence of hESC-derived endodermal lineage intermediates.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 16: 386-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), Kcr was enriched selectively in endodermal cells in mouse embryos (Figure 2F), suggesting a specific role of this modification in endoderm. To better understand this unique role of Kcr in endodermal cells at the genomic scale, we profiled the chromatin landscape of Kcr in comparison with that of H3K27ac in hESCs versus differentiated endodermal cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis (Figures 3A–3C and S4A; Tables S2 and S3). Gene Ontology (GO) analyses of mapped genomic loci revealed that, in pluripotent hESCs, Kcr was relatively enriched near Transcriptional Start Sites (TSSs) of genes involved in various metabolic processes, whereas the vast majority of H3K27ac was localized on enhancers of genes regulating gastrulation and endoderm formation (Figures S4B and S4C; Table S4). Three-day induction of endoderm differentiation altered the Kcr levels on 77,003 genomic loci (Figure 3A, Kcr Endo versus ESCs), with increased enrichment on enhancer regions (Figure S4D, Kcr Endo/ESCs). In contrast, the H3K27ac levels were changed on 35,010 genomic loci after endoderm differentiation (Figure 3A, H3K27ac Endo versus ESCs), with relatively increased enrichment on promoter regions (Figure S4D, H3K27ac Endo/ESCs). Remarkably, the altered Kcr sites covered 87% (30,465 of 35,010) of the altered H3K27ac sites (Figure 3A, top), and these overlapped loci were enriched near genes involved in gastrulation and endoderm development (Figure 3A, bottom), indicating that histone Kcr and H3K27ac are engaged in activation of endodermal genes upon endoderm differentiation. For example, Kcr and H3K27ac were increased on the SOX17 gene, although enrichment of Kcr was more notable compared with that of H3K27ac (Figure 3B). Further bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis showed that changes in gene expression are correlated with alterations of these two chromatin modifications upon endoderm differentiation. First, Kcr and H3K27ac were highly enriched on TSSs of genes that were regulated during endoderm differentiation (up or down) compared with their signal on TSSs of genes that were not significantly regulated (no change) (Figure 3C). Second, and importantly, the TSSs of highly induced genes (up) displayed enhanced enrichment of Kcr and H3K27ac, whereas the TSSs of repressed genes (down) were depleted of Kcr and H3K27ac (Figures 3C and 3D). ChIP-qPCR results confirmed that levels of Kcr and H3K27ac were increased strongly near the TSSs of endodermal genes but depleted near the TSS of a pluripotent gene upon endoderm differentiation (Figure 3E). Interestingly, GO analysis of 46,538 unique Kcr genomic loci altered during endoderm differentiation (Figure 3A) showed that this modification is also enriched near TSSs of genes involved in mesoderm differentiation, particularly artery and kidney development (Figure S4E), suggesting that, compared with H3K27ac, Kcr may have a special role in modulating mesoderm differentiation. Additionally, further gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the RNA-seq datasets from me1 hESCs and D3 endodermal cells revealed that pathways involved in fatty acid, triacylglycerol, and ketone body metabolism are significantly upregulated in endodermal cells compared with hESCs (Figure S4F), supporting the notion that fatty acid metabolism is induced upon endoderm differentiation. Our findings suggest that endoderm differentiation is associated with enhanced histone Kcr in cultured cells and early mouse embryos. To further evaluate the importance of histone crotonylation in endoderm differentiation, we investigated whether crotonate, a crotonyl-CoA precursor, can directly affect endoderm differentiation of hESCs. Acetate, an acetyl-CoA precursor that has been shown to increase intracellular acetyl-CoA levels, thereby maintaining pluripotency and inhibiting endoderm differentiation in H1 hESCs (Moussaieff et al., 2015Moussaieff A. Rouleau M. Kitsberg D. Cohen M. Levy G. Barasch D. Nemirovski A. Shen-Orr S. Laevsky I. Amit M. et al.Glycolysis-mediated changes in acetyl-CoA and histone acetylation control the early differentiation of embryonic stem cells.Cell Metab. 2015; 21: 392-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), was used for comparison. We confirmed that crotonate was able to dramatically increase intracellular levels of crotonyl-CoA and histone crotonylation, as reported (Sabari et al., 2015Sabari B.R. Tang Z. Huang H. Yong-Gonzalez V. Molina H. Kong H.E. Dai L. Shimada M. Cross J.R. Zhao Y. et al.Intracellular crotonyl-CoA stimulates transcription through p300-catalyzed histone crotonylation.Mol. Cell. 2015; 58: 203-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), in our cell culture systems (Figures 4A and 4B ). In contrast, adding acetate did not significantly increase intracellular steady levels of acetyl-CoA (Figure 4A), possibly because the intracellular acetyl-CoA concentration of differentiating mel1 hESCs was much higher than that of H1 hESCs (30 pmol/106 in mel1 cells versus 7 pmol/106 in H1 cells) (Figure 4A; Moussaieff et al., 2015Moussaieff A. Rouleau M. Kitsberg D. Cohen M. Levy G. Barasch D. Nemirovski A. Shen-Orr S. Laevsky I.

Our observation is consistent with a previous report where acetate did not change intracellular level of acetyl-CoA in HeLa cells (Sabari et al., 2015Sabari B.R. Tang Z. Huang H. Yong-Gonzalez V. Molina H. Kong H.E. Dai L. Shimada M. Cross J.R. Zhao Y. et al.Intracellular crotonyl-CoA stimulates transcription through p300-catalyzed histone crotonylation.Mol. Cell. 2015; 58: 203-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and suggests that the acetyl-CoA level in mel1 hESCs is already saturated. Notably, incubation with crotonate alone was sufficient to dose-dependently activate expression of differentiation markers, endodermal and mesodermal markers in particular, in pluripotent mel1 hESCs maintained in hESC medium (Figure 4C, crotonate). Inducing endoderm differentiation of mel1 hESCs massively increased the levels of endodermal markers (FOXA2, SOX17, and GOOSECOID) while significantly decreasing pluripotency markers (POU5F1 and NANOG) (Figure S2A). Crotonate further dose-dependently enhanced expression of endodermal markers (Figure 4D, crotonate) and key crotonyl-CoA-producing enzymes (Figure 4E) upon endoderm differentiation. In contrast, acetate failed to increase the expression levels of differentiation genes in hESCs"
https://openalex.org/W3118303034,"Lack of cellular differentiation is a hallmark of many human cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Strategies to overcome such a differentiation blockade are an approach for treating AML. To identify targets for differentiation-based therapies, we applied an integrated cell surface-based CRISPR platform to assess genes involved in maintaining the undifferentiated state of leukemia cells. Here we identify the RNA-binding protein ZFP36L2 as a critical regulator of AML maintenance and differentiation. Mechanistically, ZFP36L2 interacts with the 3' untranslated region of key myeloid maturation genes, including the ZFP36 paralogs, to promote their mRNA degradation and suppress terminal myeloid cell differentiation. Genetic inhibition of ZFP36L2 restores the mRNA stability of these targeted transcripts and ultimately triggers myeloid differentiation in leukemia cells. Epigenome profiling of several individuals with primary AML revealed enhancer modules near ZFP36L2 that associated with distinct AML cell states, establishing a coordinated epigenetic and post-transcriptional mechanism that shapes leukemic differentiation."

We conducted empirical analyses using linear regression, a time-varying effect model, and a regression discontinuity design to investigate the association of medical resources with the mortality rate of the COVID-19 patients in Hubei, China. The results showed that the numbers of hospital beds, healthcare system beds, and medical staff per confirmed cases all had significant negative effects on the coronavirus disease mortality rate. Furthermore, in the context of the severe pandemic currently being experienced worldwide, the present study summarized the experience and implications in pandemic prevention and control in Hubei province from the perspective of medical resource integration as follows: First, hospitals’ internal medical resources were integrated, breaking interdepartmental barriers. Second, joint pandemic control was realized by integrating regional healthcare system resources. Finally, an external medical resource allocation system was developed."

Here, an empirical Best Management Practice (BMP) regimen was tested, comprised of the top four management practices associated with reduced colony mortality in backyard beekeeping operations according to Bee Informed Partnership Loss and Management survey results. Seven study locations were established across the US, and each location consisted of ten colonies treated according to empirical BMPs and ten according to average beekeeping practice. After 3 years, colonies treated according to empirical BMPs experienced reduced Varroa infestation, viral infection, and mortality compared to colonies managed with Average practices. In addition, BMP colonies produced more new colonies via splits. The colonies under Average practices were given chemical Varroa treatments only once per year, and thus spent more months above economic threshold of 3.0 mites/100 bees. Increased time spent above the economic threshold was significantly correlated to both increased viral infection and colony mortality. This study demonstrates the cumulative effects of management and colony health stressors over months and years, especially the dire importance of regular Varroa monitoring and management."
https://openalex.org/W3120184612,"Background Nutrition transition in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has led to shift in childhood nutritional outcomes from a predominance of undernutrition to a double burden of under- and overnutrition. Yet, policies that address undernutrition often times do not include overnutrition nor do policies on overweight, obesity reflect the challenges of undernutrition. It is therefore crucial to assess the prevalence and determinants of concurrence stunting and overweight/obesity to better inform nutrition programs in Ethiopia and beyond. Methods We analyzed anthropometric, sociodemographic and dietary data of children under five years of age from 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS). A total of 8,714 children were included in the current study. Concurrence of stunting and overweight/obesity (CSO) prevalence was estimated by basic, underlying and immediate factors. To identify factors associated with CSO, we conducted hierarchical logistic regression analyses. Results The overall prevalence of CSO was 1.99% (95% CI, 1.57–2.53). The odds of CSO was significantly higher in children in agrarian region compared to their counter parts in the pastoralist region (AOR = 1.51). Other significant factors included; not having improved toilet facility (AOR = 1.94), being younger than 12 months (AOR = 4.22), not having history of infection (AOR = 1.83) and not having taken deworming tablet within the previous six months (AOR = 1.49). Conclusion Our study provided evidence on the co-existence of stunting and overweight/obesity among infants and young children in Ethiopia. Therefore, identifying children at risk of growth flattering and excess weight gain provides nutrition policies and programs in Ethiopia and beyond with an opportunity of earlier interventions through improving sanitation, dietary quality by targeting children under five years of age and those living in Agrarian regions of Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W3121612188,"Background Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to severe infection from influenza resulting in poor neonatal outcomes. The majority of evidence relates to pandemic 2009 A/H1N1 influenza. The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women hospitalised with seasonal influenza. Methods This national, prospective, observational cohort study used the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) to identify all pregnant women admitted to hospital between 01/11/2016 and 31/10/2018 with laboratory confirmed influenza at any gestation and up to two days after giving birth. These were compared to women admitted to give birth that did not have influenza. Baseline characteristics, immunization status, maternal and perinatal outcomes were compared. Results There were 405 women admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed influenza in pregnancy: 2.7 per 10,000 maternities. Compared to 694 comparison women, women with influenza were less likely to be professionally employed (aOR 0.59, 95%CI 0.39–0.89) or immunised in the relevant season (aOR 0·59, 0·39–0·89) and more likely to have asthma (aOR 2.42, 1.30–4.49) or have had a previous pregnancy complication (aOR 2·47, 1·33–4·61). They were more likely to be admitted to intensive care (aOR 21.3, 2.78–163.1) and to have a cesarean birth (aOR 1·42, 1·02–1.98). Their babies were more likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care (aOR 1.86, 1·01–3·42). Conclusions Immunization reduces the risk of hospitalisation with influenza in pregnancy which is associated with increased risk of morbidity for both the mother and baby. There is a continued need to increase awareness of safety and effectiveness of immunization in pregnancy and provision within antenatal care settings, especially for high-risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W3119805565,"Objective To determine whether emotional and physical intimate partner violence (IPV) and financial adversity increase risk of incident homelessness in pregnancy and the post-partum period. Study design Data were drawn from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, which starting in 1990 mailed questionnaires to 14,735 mothers in the UK, over 7 years from pregnancy onwards. Marginal structural models and multiple imputation were used to address time-varying confounding of the primary variables, testing for interaction between concurrent emotional/physical IPV and financial adversity, and adjusted for baseline age, ethnicity, education, partner’s alcohol use, parity, depression, and social class. Results Emotional IPV (HR 1.44 (1.13,1.84)), physical IPV (HR 2.05 (1.21,3.49)), and financial adversity (HR 1.59 (1.44,1.77)) each predicted a multiplicative increase in the discrete-time hazard of incident homelessness. We identified joint effects for concurrent emotional IPV and financial adversity (HR 2.09 (1.35,3.22)) and concurrent physical IPV and financial adversity (HR 2.79 (1.21,6.44)). We further identified a temporary decline in self-reported physical IPV among mothers during pregnancy and up to 8 months post-partum. Conclusions Emotional and physical IPV and financial adversity independently and jointly increase the risk of incident homelessness. The effects of emotional and physical IPV are comparable to or greater than the risk of financial adversity. Homelessness prevention policies should consider IPV victims as high-risk, regardless of financial status. Furthermore, self-reported physical IPV declines temporarily during pregnancy and up to 8 months post-partum. Screening for IPV in this period may miss high-risk individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3122785142,"β-lactam antibiotics are the most widely used antimicrobial agents since the discovery of benzylpenicillin in the 1920s. Unfortunately, these life-saving antibiotics are vulnerable to inactivation by continuously evolving β-lactamase enzymes that are primary resistance determinants in multi-drug resistant pathogens. The current study exploits the strategy of combination therapeutics and aims at identifying novel β-lactamase inhibitors that can inactivate the β-lactamase enzyme of the pathogen while allowing the β-lactam antibiotic to act against its penicillin-binding protein target. Inhibitor discovery applied the Site-Identification by Ligand Competitive Saturation (SILCS) technology to map the functional group requirements of the β-lactamase CMY-10 and generate pharmacophore models of active site. SILCS-MC, Ligand-grid Free Energy (LGFE) analysis and Machine-learning based random-forest (RF) scoring methods were then used to screen and filter a library of 700,000 compounds. From the computational screens 74 compounds were subjected to experimental validation in which β-lactamase activity assay, in vitro susceptibility testing, and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis were conducted to explore their antibacterial potential. Eleven compounds were identified as enhancers while 7 compounds were recognized as inhibitors of CMY-10. Of these, compound 11 showed promising activity in β-lactamase activity assay, in vitro susceptibility testing against ATCC strains ( E . coli , E . cloacae , E . agglomerans , E . alvei ) and MDR clinical isolates ( E . cloacae , E . alvei and E . agglomerans ), with synergistic assay indicating its potential as a β-lactam enhancer and β-lactamase inhibitor. Structural similarity search against the active compound 11 yielded 28 more compounds. The majority of these compounds also exhibited β-lactamase inhibition potential and antibacterial activity. The non-β-lactam-based β-lactamase inhibitors identified in the current study have the potential to be used in combination therapy with lactam-based antibiotics against MDR clinical isolates that have been found resistant against last-line antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W3118829708,"Existing text clustering methods utilize only one representation at a time (single view), whereas multiple views can represent documents. The multiview multirepresentation method enhances clustering quality. Moreover, existing clustering methods that utilize more than one representation at a time (multiview) use representation with the same nature. Hence, using multiple views that represent data in a different representation with clustering methods is reasonable to create a diverse set of candidate clustering solutions. On this basis, an effective dynamic clustering method must consider combining multiple views of data including semantic view, lexical view (word weighting), and topic view as well as the number of clusters. The main goal of this study is to develop a new method that can improve the performance of web search result clustering (WSRC). An enhanced multiview multirepresentation consensus clustering ensemble (MMCC) method is proposed to create a set of diverse candidate solutions and select a high-quality overlapping cluster. The overlapping clusters are obtained from the candidate solutions created by different clustering methods. The framework to develop the proposed MMCC includes numerous stages: (1) acquiring the standard datasets (MORESQUE and Open Directory Project-239), which are used to validate search result clustering algorithms, (2) preprocessing the dataset, (3) applying multiview multirepresentation clustering models, (4) using the radius-based cluster number estimation algorithm, and (5) employing the consensus clustering ensemble method. Results show an improvement in clustering methods when multiview multirepresentation is used. More importantly, the proposed MMCC model improves the overall performance of WSRC compared with all single-view clustering models."
https://openalex.org/W3122100149,"Introduction of semi-dwarfism and early maturity in rice cultivars is important to achieve improved plant architecture, lodging resistance and high yield. Gamma rays induced mutations are routinely used to achieve these traits. We report the development of a semi-dwarf, early maturing and high-yielding mutant of rice cultivar ‘Improved White Ponni’, a popular cosmopolitan variety in south India preferred for its superior grain quality traits. Through gamma rays induced mutagenesis, several mutants were developed and subjected to selection up to six generations (M 6 ) until the superior mutants were stabilized. In the M 6 generation, significant reduction in days to flowering (up to 11.81% reduction) and plant height (up to 40% reduction) combined with an increase in single plant yield (up to 45.73% increase) was observed in the mutant population. The cooking quality traits viz ., linear elongation ratio, breadthwise expansion ratio, gel consistency and gelatinization temperature of the mutants were similar to the parent variety Improved White Ponni. The genetic characterization with SSR markers showed variability between the semi-dwarf-early mutants and the Improved White Ponni. Gibberellin responsiveness study and quantitative real-time PCR showed a faulty gibberellin pathway and epistatic control between the genes such as OsKOL4 and OsBRD2 causing semi-dwarfism in a mutant. These mutants have potential as new rice varieties and can be used as new sources of semi-dwarfism and earliness for improving high grain quality rice varieties."
https://openalex.org/W3124599323,"This study explores whether an oath to honesty can reduce both shirking and lying among crowd-sourced internet workers. Using a classic coin-flip experiment, we first confirm that a substantial majority of Mechanical Turk workers both shirk and lie when reporting the number of heads flipped. We then demonstrate that lying can be reduced by first asking each worker to swear voluntarily on his or her honor to tell the truth in subsequent economic decisions. Even in this online, purely anonymous environment, the oath significantly reduced the percent of subjects telling “big” lies (by roughly 27%), but did not affect shirking. We also explore whether a truth-telling oath can be used as a screening device if implemented after decisions have been made. Conditional on flipping response, MTurk shirkers and workers who lied were significantly less likely to agree to an ex-post honesty oath. Our results suggest oaths may help elicit more truthful behavior, even in online crowd-sourced environments."

Methods and materials Six RP models have been generated and trained based on 120 VMAT plans data set with different criteria. Two extra-structures were delineated: a PTV for the optimization and a ring structure. Five more models, twins of the previous models, have been created without the need of these structures. Results All models were successfully validated on an independent cohort of 40 patients, 30 from the same institute that provided the training patients and 10 from an additional institute, with the resulting plans being of equal or better quality compared with the clinical plans. The internal validation shows that the models reduce the heart maximum dose of about 2 Gy, the mean dose of about 1 Gy and the V 20Gy of 1.5 Gy on average. Model R and L together with model B without optimization structures ensured the best outcomes in the 20% of the values compared to other models. The external validation observed an average improvement of at least 16% for the V 5Gy of lungs in RP plans. The mean heart dose and for the V 20Gy for lung IPSI were almost halved. The models reduce the maximum dose for the spinal canal of more than 2 Gy on average Conclusions All KB models allow a homogeneous plan quality and some dosimetric gains, as we saw in both internal and external validation. Sub-KB models, developed by splitting right and left breast cases or including only whole breast with locoregional lymph nodes, have shown good performances, comparable but slightly worse than the general model. Finally, models generated without the optimization structures, performed better than the original ones."

We investigated the relationship of the ESA resistance index (ERI) and the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) for cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods A total of 180 maintenance HD patients were enrolled. The patients were stratified by the GNRI of 91.2, a previously reported cut-off value, and the ERI of 13.7 (IU/week/kg/g/dL), a cut-off value for predicting cardiovascular-specific mortality, and they were classified into four groups (group 1[G1]: higher GNRI and lower ERI, G2: higher GNRI and higher ERI, G3: lower GNRI and lower ERI, G4: lower GNRI and higher ERI). Results The ERI was independently associated with the GNRI (β = −0.271, p = 0.0005). During a median follow-up of 4.6 years, higher ERI and lower GNRI were independently associated with cardiovascular mortality, respectively (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 3.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.31–7.34, and aHR, 6.64; 95%CI, 2.60–16.93, respectively). The 7-year survival rates were 96.1%, 70.3%, 77.3%, and 50.1% in G1, G2, G3, and G4, respectively. The aHR values for G4 versus G1 were 12.63 (95%CI, 3.58–44.59). With regards to model discrimination, adding the GNRI alone, the ERI alone, and both to the traditional risk model significantly improved the net reclassification improvement by 0.421, 0.662, and 0.671, respectively. Similar results were obtained for all-cause mortality. Conclusion The ERI was independently associated with the GNRI, and could predict cardiovascular mortality in HD patients. Moreover, the combination of GNRI and ERI could improve the predictability for cardiovascular mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3124880646,"Background Thyroid cancer diagnosis has evolved to include computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) approaches to overcome the limitations of human ultrasound feature assessment. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a CAD system in thyroid nodule differentiation using varied settings. Methods Ultrasound images of 205 thyroid nodules from 198 patients were analysed in this retrospective study. AmCAD-UT software was used at default settings and 3 adjusted settings to diagnose the nodules. Six risk-stratification systems in the software were used to classify the thyroid nodules: The American Thyroid Association (ATA), American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging, Reporting, and Data System (ACR-TIRADS), British Thyroid Association (BTA), European Union (EU-TIRADS), Kwak (2011) and the Korean Society of Thyroid Radiology (KSThR). The diagnostic performance of CAD was determined relative to the histopathology and/or cytology diagnosis of each nodule. Results At the default setting, EU-TIRADS yielded the highest sensitivity, 82.6% and lowest specificity, 42.1% while the ATA-TIRADS yielded the highest specificity, 66.4%. Kwak had the highest AUROC (0.74) which was comparable to that of ACR, ATA, and KSThR TIRADS (0.72, 0.73, and 0.70 respectively). At a hyperechoic foci setting of 3.5 with other settings at median values; ATA had the best-balanced sensitivity, specificity and good AUROC (70.4%; 67.3% and 0.71 respectively). Conclusion The default setting achieved the best diagnostic performance with all TIRADS and was best for maximizing the sensitivity of EU-TIRADS. Adjusting the settings by only reducing the sensitivity to echogenic foci may be most helpful for improving specificity with minimal change in sensitivity."

Wood inhabiting fungi release a diversity of volatiles used as signaling compounds to attract or repel other organisms. Here, we show that volatiles of Schizophyllum commune are active against wood-decay fungi and bacteria found in its mycosphere. We identified sesquiterpenes as the biologically active compounds, that inhibit fungal growth and modify bacterial motility. The low number of cultivable wood inhabiting bacteria prompted us to analyze the microbial community in the mycosphere of S . commune using a culture-independent approach. Most bacteria belong to Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria , including Pseudomonadaceae , Sphingomonadaceae , Erwiniaceae , Yersiniaceae and Mariprofundacea as the dominating families. In the fungal community, the phyla of ascomycetes and basidiomycetes were well represented. We propose that fungal volatiles might have an important function in the wood mycosphere and could meditate interactions between microorganisms across domains and within the fungal kingdom."
https://openalex.org/W3118702489,"Digoxin is commonly prescribed for heart failure and atrial fibrillation, but there is limited data on its safety in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We conducted a population-based cohort study using the pre-end stage renal disease (ESRD) care program registry and the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Of advanced CKD patient cohort (N = 31,933), we identified the digoxin user group (N = 400) matched with age and sex non-user group (N = 2,220). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards and sub-distribution hazards models were used to evaluate the association between digoxin use and the risk of death, cardiovascular events (acute coronary syndrome, ischemic stroke, or hemorrhagic stroke) and renal outcomes (ESRD, rapid decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate—eGFR, or acute kidney injury). Results showed that all-cause mortality was higher in the digoxin user group than in the non-user group, after adjusting for covariates (adjusted hazard ratio, aHR 1.63; 95% CI 1.23–2.17). The risk for acute coronary syndrome (sub-distribution hazard ratio, sHR 1.18; 95% CI 0.75–1.86), ischemic stroke (sHR 1.42; 95% CI 0.85–2.37), and rapid eGFR decline (sHR 1.00 95% CI 0.78–1.27) was not significantly different between two groups. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that digoxin use was associated with increased mortality, but not cardiovascular events or renal function decline in advanced CKD patients. This finding warns the safety of prescribing digoxin in this population. Future prospective studies are needed to overcome the limitations of cohort study design."
https://openalex.org/W3120209253,"Objectives To establish the prevalence of multimorbidity in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 1–5 and transiently impaired renal function and identify factors associated with multimorbidity. Design and setting Prospective cohort study in UK primary care. Participants 861 participants aged 60 and older with decreased renal function of whom, 584 (65.8%) had CKD and 277 (32.2%) did not have CKD. Interventions Participants underwent medical history and clinical assessment, and blood and urine sampling. Primary and secondary outcome measures Multimorbidity was defined as presence of ≥2 chronic conditions including CKD. Prevalence of each condition, co-existing conditions and multimorbidity were described and logistic regression was used to identify predictors of multimorbidity. Results The mean (±SD) age of participants was 74±7 years, 54% were women and 98% were white. After CKD, the next most prevalent condition was hypertension (n = 511, 59.3%), followed by obesity (n = 265, 30.8%) ischemic heart disease (n = 145, 16.8%) and diabetes (n = 133, 15.4%). Having two co-existing conditions was most common (27%), the most common combination of which was hypertension and obesity (29%). One or three conditions was the next most prevalent combination (20% and 21% respectively). The prevalence of multimorbidity was 73.9% (95%CI 70.9–76.8) in all participants and 86.6% (95%CI 83.9–89.3) in those with any-stage CKD. Logistic regression found a significant association between increasing age (OR 1.07, 95%CI 1.04–0.10), increasing BMI (OR 1.15, 95%CI 1.10–1.20) and decreasing eGFR (OR 0.99, 95%CI 0.98–1.00) with multimorbidity. Conclusions This analysis is the first to provide an accurate estimate of the prevalence of multimorbidity in a screened older primary care population living with or at risk of CKD across all stages. Hypertension and obesity were the most common combination of conditions other than CKD that people were living with, suggesting that there may be multiple reasons for closely monitoring health status in individuals with CKD."
https://openalex.org/W3120289520,"Clinical experience indicates that excessive sleepiness and hypersomnia may be a common issue for patients with psychosis. Excessive sleepiness is typically ascribed to the sedating effects of antipsychotic medications but there may be other potential contributors such as sleep disorders and depression. Furthermore, the impact of excessive sleepiness itself on patients’ symptoms and general wellbeing is yet to be examined. The current study reports an exploratory cross-sectional between-groups comparison of patients with early psychosis fulfilling criteria assessed in a diagnostic interview for problematic excessive sleepiness (n = 14), compared with those not reporting excessive sleepiness (n = 46). There were no differences between the groups in diagnosis, medication type, or antipsychotic medication dosage. There were no significant group differences in sleep duration. Significantly lower activity levels were found in the excessive sleepiness group. Insomnia and nightmares were common in those reporting excessive sleepiness. No significant differences were found in psychiatric symptoms, although data did indicate more severe cognitive disorganisation and grandiosity, but less severe paranoia and hallucinations, in the excessive sleepiness group. Wide confidence intervals and small sample size mean that care should be taken interpreting these results. Overall, this study indicates that excessive sleepiness may not be solely related to medication but also to low levels of activity and other sleep disorders. This is a novel finding that, if replicated, could indicate routes of intervention for this clinical issue. Future research should aim to disentangle directions of effect amongst sleepiness, mood, activity, and psychotic symptoms and investigate possible interventions for excessive sleepiness in psychosis."
https://openalex.org/W3121019242,"The phylogeny of the cricket genus Eidmanacris is used to analyse its historical distribution and diversification in three South American biomes: Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, and Chiquitano Dry Forest. A morphological phylogeny with all the 29 species of Eidmanacris and the Geographically explicit Event Model (GEM) is used to explain their colonization and diversification through three different biomes and their ancestral habitats and distributional areas. We analysed ecologically-significant characters, such as body size and metanotal characters, to test whether if morphology, habitat, or behaviour are connected. The relations of these features with the colonisation of wetter or drier biomes based on the distributional area, phylogeny and diversity of the genus were also tested. The results show that the ancestral distribution of the genus was the Atlantic Forest, and that biome occupancy, habitat, size, and mating behaviour evolved congruently through the phylogeny, drawing a coherent pattern of changes through Eidmanacris evolution toward the colonisation of drier biomes. Our results indicate that gallery forests could play a key role in the distribution and diversification of Eidmanacris species."
https://openalex.org/W3122722958,"Concentrating fruit juices by freezing supports the maintenance of both nutrients and flavors. Development of the freezing concentration process has introduced equipment such as centrifuge or block freezing systems, which are suitable for large-scale commercial processing. However, the necessary characteristics of freeze concentration methods for juices include simplicity and low cost. This study examined the effects of different container shapes on the processes of freezing and melting. The shape of the container was found to be more important than the melting temperature, across a relatively large scale. Furthermore, the nutrient procyanidin B2 and saccharides were concentrated. The methods concentrated juice components under low cost conditions without complex equipment. This research thus not only offers benefits for commercial juice preparation but also provides new insight into effects of shape differences in concentration technologies."
https://openalex.org/W3125814744,"In this paper, the authors use survey data from over 800 households to examine the impact of demonstration plots and associated activities (distribution of small packs of agricultural inputs) on smallholder farmers’ decisions to buy agricultural inputs in Tanzania. Using propensity score matching and inverse probability-weighted adjustment models, the authors estimated the effect of access to demonstration plots alone and demonstration plots combined with small packs of agricultural inputs on a household’s decision to purchase improved inputs. The results indicate that access to demonstration plots and demonstration plots with small packs increased the probability of purchasing improved inputs by 13–17 percentage points. This paper suggests that demonstration plots and demonstration plots with small packs are an effective model for enhancing improved technology adoption and are further increased when those inputs are available within a 5km radius. The results point to the importance of strengthening farmers’ organizations and last-mile agricultural input suppliers in order to enhance and facilitate access to information, appropriate production techniques, and improved inputs. The results also indicate the importance of investing in infrastructure to reduce transportation costs that limit market efficiency for appropriate technologies."
https://openalex.org/W3120319714,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) remains a key health menace in Ethiopia and its districts. This study aimed to assess the spatial-temporal clustering of notified pulmonary TB (PTB) cases in East Gojjam Zone, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A retrospective study was conducted among all PTB cases reported from 2013–2019. Case notification rates (CNRs) of PTB cases at Kebele (the lowest administrative unit), woreda , and zone levels were estimated. The PTB clustering was done using global Moran’s I statistics on Arc GIS 10.6. We used Kulldorff SaTScan 9.6 with a discrete Poisson model to identify statistically significant spatial-temporal clustering of PTB cases at Kebele level. Similarly, a negative binomial regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with the incidence of PTB cases at kebele level. Results A total of 5340 (52%) smear-positive and 4928 (48%) smear-negative PTB cases were analyzed. The overall mean CNR of PTB cases at zone, woreda and Kebele levels were 58(47–69), 82(56–204), and 69(36–347) per 100,000 population, respectively. The purely spatial cluster analysis identified eight most likely clusters (one for overall and one per year for seven reporting years) and 47 secondary clusters. Similarly, the space-time scan analysis identified one most likely and seven secondary clusters. The purely temporal analysis also detected one most likely cluster from 2013–2015. Rural residence, distance from the nearest health facility, and poor TB service readiness were factors (p-value &lt;0.05) to PTB incidence at kebele level. Conclusion The distribution of PTB cases was clustered. The PTB CNR was low and showed a decreasing trend during the reporting periods. Rural residence, distance from the health facilities, and poor facility readiness were factors of PTB incidence. Improving accessibility and readiness of health facilities mainly to rural and hotspot areas is vital to increase case detection and reduce TB transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3120919779,"This study aimed to provide the performance, localization and expression of the epithelial calcium transporter channels Calbindin-D28k (Calb) and TRPV6, and of the morphology of the digestive and reproductive system of laying quail under heat stress (HS), and with methionine supplementation (MS). This study characterized the positivity (immunohistochemistry) and expression (real-time PCR) of calcium channels in the kidneys, intestine and uterus of 504 laying quails under different MS (100, 110 and 120%) and temperatures (20, 24, 28 and 32°C). The animals under HS (32°C) had lower villus height, villus:crypt ratio, and goblet cell index in the duodenum and jejunum, fewer secondary and tertiary uterine folds, smaller hepatic steatosis, and increased number of distal convoluted renal tubules (CT) positive to Calb, and increased positivity in proximal CTs. Deleterious effects of HS were minimized with MS for: duodenal crypts, number of goblet cells of the jejunum, number of uterine folds, decreased Calb positivity in intestines and kidney, increased positivity of Calb in the uterus and increased TRPV6 gene expression in the kidney (P≤0.05). Epithelial calcium transporters were altered due to less need for calcium absorption and reabsorption due to more calcium available with the MS, increasing egg production in HS and quality in termoneutrality (P≤0.05). MS further increased intestinal villus absorption area and height, increased steatosis, decreased Calb positivity in the intestine and kidney, increased uterine positivity of Calb, and increase Calb and TRPV6 expression in the kidney (P≤0.001) under thermoneutrality. It was concluded that the use of MS (120%) is justifiable in order to partially reverse the deleterious effects of HS on the production, in the epithelial calcium carriers, and in the digestory and reproductive morphology of laying quail."
https://openalex.org/W3124919699,"Cats, similar to humans, are known to be affected by hippocampal sclerosis (HS), potentially causing antiepileptic drug (AED) resistance. HS can occur as a consequence of chronic seizure activity, trauma, inflammation, or even as a primary disease. In humans, temporal lobe resection is the standardized therapy in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The majority of TLE patients are seizure free after surgery. Therefore, the purpose of this prospective cadaveric study is to establish a surgical technique for hippocampal resection in cats as a treatment for AED resistant seizures. Ten cats of different head morphology were examined. Pre-surgical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) studies of the animals’ head were carried out to complete 3D reconstruction of the head, brain, and hippocampus. The resected hippocampal specimens and the brains were histologically examined for tissue injury adjacent to the hippocampus. The feasibility of the procedure, as well as the usability of the removed specimen for histopathological examination, was assessed. Moreover, a micro-CT (mCT) examination of the brain of two additional cats was performed in order to assess temporal vasculature as a reason for possible intraoperative complications. In all cats but one, the resection of the temporal cortex and the hippocampus were successful without any evidence of traumatic or vascular lesions in the surrounding neurovascular structures. In one cat, the presence of mechanical damage (a fissure) of the thalamic surface was evident in the histopathologic examination of the brain post-resection. All hippocampal fields and the dentate gyrus were identified in the majority of the cats via histological examination. The study describes a new surgical approach (partial temporal cortico-hippocampectomy) offering a potential treatment for cats with clinical and diagnostic evidence of temporal epilepsy which do not respond adequately to the medical therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3125000069,"Introduction Early alcohol consumption can irreversible damage the adolescents’ brain and may affect their quality of life. In order to better prevent such a deleterious behaviour, knowing its determinants is needed. So far, only few studies among adolescents aged &lt;15 years exist, of which the majority failed to include gender differences. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether gender differences in the association between alcohol use and sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics among 10-14-year olds exist. Methods Data came from the 2018 Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) study conducted in French-speaking schools of Belgium. The sample analysed here comprised 4,364 10-14-year olds from the Walloon Region. Associations of the recent alcohol consumption (at least one glass during the past month) with sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics were estimated using gender-stratified multivariable logistic regression modelling. Results Prevalence of early alcohol consumption was 14% (boys: 16%; girls: 12%). Migration status and family affluence scale (FAS) were associated with early alcohol consumption only in boys. Second-generation immigrant boys (vs. natives: OR = 0.66 [0.47–0.92]) and boys from “low” FAS families (vs. “high”: OR = 0.56 [0.32–0.98]) or “medium” FAS (vs. “high”: OR = 0.63 [0.43–0.92]) were less likely to have consumed alcohol in the past month. In both genders, alcohol consumption was positively associated with age and inversely associated with school satisfaction and family support. No association was observed with family structure, peer support and life satisfaction in the multivariable models. Conclusion Our findings showed that gender differences may exist in the determinants of alcohol consumption among young adolescents. They will contribute to the development of public health policies and actions for the most vulnerable adolescents, which should take gender differences into account."
https://openalex.org/W3118604347,"This paper seeks to advance neighbourhood change research and complexity theories of cities by developing and exploring a Markov model of socio-spatial neighbourhood evolution in Toronto, Canada. First, we classify Toronto neighbourhoods into distinct groups using established geodemographic segmentation techniques, a relatively novel application in this geographic setting. Extending previous studies, we pursue a hierarchical approach to classifying neighbourhoods that situates many neighbourhood types within the city’s broader structure. Our hierarchical approach is able to incorporate a richer set of types than most past research and allows us to study how neighbourhoods’ positions within this hierarchy shape their trajectories of change. Second, we use Markov models to identify generative processes that produce patterns of change in the city’s distribution of neighbourhood types. Moreover, we add a spatial component to the Markov process to uncover the extent to which change in one type of neighbourhood depends on the character of nearby neighbourhoods. In contrast to the few studies that have explored Markov models in this research tradition, we validate the model’s predictive power. Third, we demonstrate how to use such models in theoretical scenarios considering the impact on the city’s predicted evolutionary trajectory when existing probabilities of neighbourhood transitions or distributions of neighbourhood types would hypothetically change. Markov models of transition patterns prove to be highly accurate in predicting the final distribution of neighbourhood types. Counterfactual scenarios empirically demonstrate urban complexity: small initial changes reverberate throughout the system, and unfold differently depending on their initial geographic distribution. These scenarios show the value of complexity as a framework for interpreting data and guiding scenario-based planning exercises."
https://openalex.org/W3120268235,"Diabetic neuropathy is the most common complication affecting more than 50% of patients with longstanding diabetes. Till date, there are no reports to explain the scientific basis of alternative medicine as an adjunct therapy for treating diabetic neuropathy. Hence, we studied the effect of honey and insulin treatment on hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, oxidant and anti-oxidant status and nerve conduction in experimental diabetic neuropathy Wistar rats. In this experimental study, forty healthy male Wistar albino rats of 10–12 weeks age, weighing between 150 to 200g were obtained from our institute central animal house. After acclimatization, the rats were divided into control (n = 8) and experimental (n = 32) groups randomly. In the experimental group, type 2 diabetic neuropathy was induced with high fat and high sugar diet for 8 weeks followed by streptozotocin at a dose of 35 mg/kg body weight. Three days after streptozotocin injection, blood glucose levels of rats were measured from fasting samples to confirm diabetes. After the development of diabetes, rats were given standard rodent chow and allowed four more weeks to remain diabetic and to develop neuropathy. Every second week, nerve conduction study was done to confirm neuropathy. All the diabetic rats of experimental group developed neuropathy after 4 weeks of developing diabetes, which was confirmed by significant reduction in conduction velocity of sensory and motor nerve when compared to non-diabetic control group. After the development of neuropathy, these rats were randomly divided into diabetic neuropathy with no treatment group (n = 8) and three treatment groups (n = 8, each). The rats of treatment group were administered with either honey or insulin or honey+insulin for six weeks. After six-weeks of intervention, there was significant decrease in blood glucose and lipids in honey, insulin and honey+insulin treated neuropathy rats, when compared with no treatment group. Malondialdehyde was reduced and total anti-oxidant status improved in all the three treatment groups. There was no significant increase in conduction velocity of sciatic tibial motor nerve in treatment groups when compared with no treatment group. However, the sensory nerve conduction velocity improved significantly in honey+insulin treated neuropathy rats. In conclusion, six-week honey treatment helped in reducing dyslipidemia and oxidative stress. Honey given along with insulin for six-weeks improved sensory nerve conduction velocity in experimental diabetic neuropathy Wistar rats."
https://openalex.org/W3122039999,"Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a treatment for liver tumors with advantages over the traditional treatment of surgical resection. This procedure has the shortest recovery time in early stage tumors. The objective of this study is to parameterize the impedance curve of the RFA procedure in an ex vivo model by defining seven parameters ( t 1/2 , t minimum , t end , Z initial , Z 1/2 , Z minimum and Z end ). Based on these parameters, three performance indices are defined: one to identify the magnitude of impedance curve asymmetry ( δ ), one Drop ratio (DR) describing the percentage of impedance decrease until the minimum impedance point is reached, and Ascent Ratio (AR) describing the magnitude of increase in impedance from the minimum impedance point to its maximum point. Fifty ablations were performed in a bovine ex vivo model to measure and evaluate the proposed parameters and performance index. The results show that the groups had an average δ of 29.02%, DR of 22.41%, and AR of 545.33% for RFA without the use of saline or deionized solutions. The saline solution and deionized water-cooled groups indicated the correlation of performance indices δ , DR, and AR with the obtained final ablation volume. Therefore, by controlling these parameters and indices, lower recurrence is achieved."
https://openalex.org/W3122330513,"Some human organs are composed of bifurcated structures. Two simple branching modes—monopodial and dipodial—have been proposed. With monopodial branching, child branches extend from the sidewall of the parent branch. With dipodial branching, the tip of the bronchus bifurcates. However, the branching modes of the human bronchial tree have not been elucidated precisely. A total of 48 samples between Carnegie stage (CS) 15 and CS23 belonging to the Kyoto Collection were used to acquire imaging data with phase-contrast X-ray computed tomography. Bronchial trees of all samples were three-dimensionally reconstructed from the image data. We analyzed the lobar bronchus, segmental bronchus, and subsegmental bronchus. After calculating each bronchus length, we categorized the branching mode of the analyzed bronchi based on whether the parent bronchus was divided after generation of the analyzed bronchi. All lobar bronchi were formed with monopodial branching. Twenty-five bifurcations were analyzed to categorize the branching mode of the segmental and subsegmental bronchi; 22 bifurcations were categorized as monopodial branching, two bifurcations were not categorized as any branching pattern, and the only lingular bronchus that bifurcated from the left superior lobar bronchus was categorized as dipodial branching. The left superior lobar bronchus did not shorten during the period from CS17 or CS18, when the child branch was generated, to CS23. All analyzed bronchi that could be categorized, except for one, were categorized as monopodial branching. The branching modes of the lobar bronchus and segmental bronchus were similar in the mouse lung and human lung; however, the modes of the subsegmental bronchi were different. Furthermore, remodeling, such as shrinkage of the bronchus, was not observed during the analysis period. Our three-dimensional reconstructions allowed precise calculation of the bronchus length, thereby improving the knowledge of branching morphogenesis in the human embryonic lung."
https://openalex.org/W3122723081,"γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human brain. It has been shown that altered GABA concentration plays an important role in a variety of psychiatric and neurological disorders. The main purpose of this study was to propose a combination of PRESS and MEGA-PRESS acquisitions for absolute GABA quantification and to compare GABA estimations obtained using total choline (tCho), total creatine (tCr), and total N-acetyl aspartate (tNAA) as the internal concentration references with water referenced quantification. The second aim was to demonstrate the fitting approach of MEGA-PRESS spectra with QuasarX algorithm using a basis set of GABA, glutamate, glutamine, and NAA in vitro spectra. Thirteen volunteers were scanned with the MEGA-PRESS sequence at 3T. Interleaved water referencing was used for quantification, B 0 drift correction and to update the carrier frequency of RF pulses in real time. Reference metabolite concentrations were acquired using a PRESS sequence with short TE (30 ms) and long TR (5000 ms). Absolute concentration were corrected for cerebrospinal fluid, gray and white matter water fractions and relaxation effects. Water referenced GABA estimations were significantly higher compared to the values obtained by metabolite references. We conclude that QuasarX algorithm together with the basis set of in vitro spectra improves reliability of GABA+ fitting. The proposed GABA quantification method with PRESS and MEGA-PRESS acquisitions enables the utilization of tCho, tCr, and tNAA as internal concentration references. The use of different concentration references have a good potential to improve the reliability of GABA estimation."
https://openalex.org/W3124600981,"Obesity is closely associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and elevated serum palmitate is the link between obesity and excessive hepatic lipid accumulation. Forkhead box O-1 (FoxO1) is one of the FoxO family members of transcription factors and can stimulate adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and suppress its inhibitor G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) expression in the liver. However, previous researches have also shown conflicting results regarding the role of FoxO1 in hepatic lipid accumulation. We therefore examined the role of FoxO1 as a downstream suppressor to palmitate-stimulated hepatic steatosis. Palmitate significantly promoted lipid accumulation but inhibited lipid decomposition in human HepG2 hepatoma cells. Palmitate also significantly reduced FoxO1, ATGL and its activator comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58) expression but increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorγ (PPARγ) and its target gene G0S2 expression. FoxO1 overexpression significantly increased palmitate-inhibited ATGL and CGI-58 expression but reduced palmitate-stimulated PPARγ and its target gene G0S2 expression. FoxO1 overexpression also inhibited lipid accumulation and promoted lipolysis in palmitate-treated hepatocytes. Overall, these results indicate that FoxO1-mediated ATGL-dependent lipolysis may be an effective molecular mechanism in protecting hepatocytes from palmitate-induced fat accumulation."

We aimed to assess the impact of COVID on acute stroke clinical trial conduct at sites that continued to enroll patients during the pandemic. BEST-MSU is an ongoing study of Mobile Stroke Units (MSU) vs standard management of tPA-eligible acute stroke patients in the pre-hospital setting. MSU personnel include a vascular neurologist via telemedicine, and a nurse, CT technologist, paramedics and emergency medicine technicians on-board. During COVID, consent, 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and EQ5D were obtained by phone instead of in-person, but other aspects of management were similar to the pre-COVID period. We compared patient demographics, study metrics, and infection of study personnel during intra- vs pre-COVID eras. Five of 6 BEST-MSU sites continued to enroll during COVID. There were no differences in intra- (n = 57) vs pre- (n = 869) COVID enrolled tPA eligible patients’ age, sex, race (38.6% vs 38.0% Black), ethnicity (15.8% vs 18.6% Hispanic), or NIHSS (median 11 vs 9). The percent of screened patients enrolled and adjudicated tPA eligible declined from 13.6% to 6.6% (p &lt; .001); study enrollment correlated with local stay-at-home and reopening orders. There were no differences in alert to MSU arrival or arrival to tPA times, but MSU on-scene time was 5 min longer (p = .01). There were no differences in ED door to CT, tPA treatment or thrombectomy puncture times, hospital length of stay, discharge disposition, or remote vs in-person 90-day mRS or EQ5D. One MSU nurse tested positive but did not require hospitalization. Clinical research in the pre-hospital setting can be carried out accurately and safely during a pandemic. tPA eligibility rates declined, but otherwise there were no differences in patient demographics, deterioration of study processes, or serious infection of study staff.

https://openalex.org/W3124829490,"Integrated weed management (IWM) is currently the most appropriate and effective method of agricultural weed control. To determine the most effective strategy, it is necessary to compare the effects of different control options and their rotation. Avena fatua (common wild oat) is one of the most common and economically threatening grass weed species of cereal crops worldwide. To examine the effects of non-chemical weed management options (farmland use, delayed sowing, and summer irrigation) on control of A . fatua , we recorded coverage levels and field conditions in 41 sites during the spring growing season of winter wheat for about 10 years. A transition matrix model was then constructed to project coverage levels of A . fatua under each management option using ordinal logistic regression. The results showed that farmland use had a remarkable effect on coverage; notably, planting of paddy rice and vegetables, which respectively eliminated the effect of coverage in the previous year and facilitated rapid convergence of coverage to 0%. Thus, although 90% of fields under continuous wheat cultivation were found to be at risk of A . fatua colonization, the risk was reduced to almost 0% with rotation of effective farmland use. As summer irrigation was also effective, more than 50% of wheat fields with the option continuously converged to no risk for A . fatua colonization. When the different management cycles were repeated, the effects were observed within 3 years, with a steady state reached in less than 10 years. Overall, these results suggest that simplified monitoring data could help decision-making on IWM, thereby helping to improve the efficiency of agricultural production."
https://openalex.org/W3118845058,"Human influenza virus infections occur annually worldwide and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Hence, development of novel anti-influenza drugs is urgently required. Rice Power ® extract developed by the Yushin Brewer Co. Ltd. is a novel aqueous extract of rice obtained via saccharization and fermentation with various microorganisms, such as Aspergillus oryzae , yeast [such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae ], and lactic acid bacteria, possessing various biological and pharmacological properties. In our previous experimental screening with thirty types of Rice Power ® extracts, we observed that the 30 th Rice Power ® (Y30) extract promoted the survival of influenza A virus-infected Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Therefore, to identify compounds for the development of novel anti-influenza drugs, we aimed to investigate whether the Y30 extract exhibits anti-influenza A virus activity. In the present study, we demonstrated that the Y30 extract strongly promoted the survival of influenza A H1N1 Puerto Rico 8/34 (A/PR/8/34), California 7/09, or H3N2 Aichi 2/68 (A/Aichi/2/68) viruses-infected MDCK cells and inhibited A/PR/8/34 or A/Aichi/2/68 viruses infection and growth in the co-treatment and pre-infection experiments. The pre-treatment of Y30 extract on MDCK cells did not induce anti-influenza activity in the cell. The Y30 extract did not significantly affect influenza A virus hemagglutination, and neuraminidase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activities. Interestingly, the electron microscopy experiment revealed that the Y30 extract disrupts the integrity of influenza A virus particles by permeabilizing the viral membrane envelope, suggesting that Y30 extract has a direct virucidal effect against influenza A virus. Furthermore, we observed that compared to the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract, the water extract of Y30 extract considerably promoted the survival of cells infected with A/PR/8/34 virus. These results indicated that more anti-influenza components were present in the water extract of Y30 extract than in the EtOAc extract. Our results highlight the potential of a rice extract fermented with A . oryzae and S . cerevisiae as an anti-influenza medicine and a drug source for the development of anti-influenza compounds."

This was a hospital-based retrospective study of clinical records of glaucoma patients from January 2010 to December 2019. The study involved collating demographic information of patients, clinical presentation, and the management of glaucoma. A total of nineteen thousand (19,000) charts were retrieved from the eye center’s archives. Out of these, 660 (3.5%) records of patients qualified for the study and were analyzed. There were 398 (60.3%) males and 262 (39.7%) females. Their ages ranged from 9 to 86 years (mean age = 47.30; SD ± 16.86 years). The averages of ocular parameters of 1,320 eyes (660 patients) were visual acuity = 0.26 ± 0.55 logMAR; intraocular pressure: 17.31 ± 6.11 mmHg; cup-to-disc ratios: 0.67 ± 0.17 D; and the average retinal nerve fibers thickness was 95.03 ± 21.74 μ m. The mainstay of treatment was the sole use of medication. Males were the major group receiving glaucoma care at the tertiary level. Glaucoma cases included juveniles but the mean age suggests most were of adult-onset.

https://openalex.org/W3118983525,"The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident released vast amounts of various fission products, of which 131 I and 137 Cs are considered the most important because they are a major source of radiation exposure to the general public. 137 Cs, unlike 131 I, has a 30-year half-life that continues to expose people internally and externally for several decades after being deposited into the ground. 137 Cs can be easily transmitted to the body through the intake of products and wild forest foodstuffs produced in contaminated areas. In the early phase, external exposure to 137 Cs was predominant; however, it gradually diminished, mostly owing to horizontal and vertical distribution, and internal exposure started gaining dominance. Prior studies have shown that people in the affected areas have been constantly subjected to the inevitable low-grade internal exposure, which in turn has led to high anxiety and concern regarding the potential health effects. The present 10-year study assessed the latest status of the body burden among residents of the contaminated parts of the Zhytomyr region of Ukraine by measuring the internal concentration of 137 Cs using the whole-body counter installed at the Medical Center of Korosten city. Almost 110 000 examinees from eight different districts were screened between 2009 and 2018. The study area was situated to the west of Chernobyl, which experienced a significant fallout of 137 Cs and 131 I from the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. We analyzed the data for internal exposure to 137 Cs by obtaining the actual magnitude, pace, and pattern of change for each year. During the study, the average 137 Cs concentration in residents fell from 21.6 Bq/kg at the beginning of the study to 3.0 Bq/kg at the end of the study. The proportion of examinees with detectable levels had also fallen rapidly, from 45% to 11%. We found a weaker seasonal effect and a significantly higher Bq/kg concentration in adolescents than in other age groups."
https://openalex.org/W3120925972,"The wind force acted on a tree constantly changes in magnitude, direction, and distribution. We developed a method to measure simultaneously the amount of force (F), centroid of the distributed force (C), and direction of force (D) on a tree trunk using four strain gauges. F and C were estimated from the difference in the bending moments at two different positions along the long axis of the stem. D was estimated using the difference in the sensor outputs at two different radial positions at the same height. In principle, the two strain gauges should be oriented precisely 90° apart; however, this is unrealistic on an actual tree trunk. To calculate D, we developed a new method to detect the radial position and modulus of elasticity of each strain gauge after attaching it. We conducted three types of experiment. First, we loaded a wood pole with weights arranged in 11 patterns to test the accuracies of F and C for a distributed load. Next, we applied tensile forces to the wood pole and an evergreen conifer sapling from eight directions to test the accuracy of D, F, and C. On average, estimation errors were &lt; 2% for both the distributed load and circumferential tensile load. Our method can estimate F, C, and D precisely, even if the wood is uneven and the strain gauges are not aligned. This is a great advantage for field wind force measurements."
https://openalex.org/W3122693046,"Functional screening of metagenomic libraries is an effective approach for identification of novel enzymes. A Caatinga biome goat rumen metagenomic library was screened using esculin as a substrate, and a gene from an unknown bacterium encoding a novel GH3 enzyme, BGL11, was identified. None of the BGL11 closely related genes have been previously characterized. Recombinant BGL11 was obtained and kinetically characterized. Substrate specificity of the purified protein was assessed using seven synthetic aryl substrates. Activity towards nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG), 4-nitrophenyl-β-D-xylopyranoside (pNPX) and 4-nitrophenyl-β-D-cellobioside (pNPC) suggested that BGL11 is a multifunctional enzyme with β-glucosidase, β-xylosidase, and cellobiohydrolase activities. However, further testing with five natural substrates revealed that, although BGL11 has multiple substrate specificity, it is most active towards xylobiose. Thus, in its native goat rumen environment, BGL11 most likely functions as an extracellular β-xylosidase acting on hemicellulose. Biochemical characterization of BGL11 showed an optimal pH of 5.6, and an optimal temperature of 50°C. Enzyme stability, an important parameter for industrial application, was also investigated. At 40°C purified BGL11 remained active for more than 15 hours without reduction in activity, and at 50°C, after 7 hours of incubation, BGL11 remained 60% active. The enzyme kinetic parameters of K m and V max using xylobiose were determined to be 3.88 mM and 38.53 μmol.min -1 .mg -1 , respectively, and the K cat was 57.79 s -1 . In contrast to BLG11, most β-xylosidases kinetically studied belong to the GH43 family and have been characterized only using synthetic substrates. In industry, β-xylosidases can be used for plant biomass deconstruction, and the released sugars can be fermented into valuable bio-products, ranging from the biofuel ethanol to the sugar substitute xylitol."
https://openalex.org/W3123798455,"Introduction The numbers of retrieved lymph nodes (RLNs) and positive lymph nodes (PLNs) had a significant impact on the survival of patients with ampulla of vater cancer (AVC), but the optimal numbers of the both were controversial. Objective The cohort study aimed to explore the prognostic value and the optimal point of RLNs and PLNs for AVC. Methods A total of 2347 AVC patients with M0 disease who underwent surgical resection and lymph node dissection from January 2004 to December 2013 were acquired from a prospective database. Results The study found that the optimal cut-off values of RLNs were 18 in the N0 cohort and 16 in N1 or entire cohort due to the highest 5-year overall survival (OS) rate and disease-specific survival (DSS) rate and the separation of survival curves (all P &lt; 0.05). In patients with RLNs ≥ 16, patients with PLN = 0 demonstrated significantly better 5-year OS and DSS rates (70.9% and 77.1%) compared to those with PLNs = 1–2 (41.6% and 44.7%; all P &lt; 0.001), and patients with PLNs = 1–2 demonstrated significantly better 5-year OS and DSS rates (41.6% and 44.7%) compared to those with PLNs ≥ 3 (24.3% and 28.0%; all P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions This article recommended that at least 16 lymph nodes will improve the prognosis of AVC patients undergoing surgery. The best cut-off values of PLNs recommended for this study were 0 and 2, which may accurately stratify patients."
https://openalex.org/W3125386366,"We previously reported that treatment with the prototypical antidepressant imipramine induced a dose-dependent reduction of the ingestion of a 10% sucrose solution, due to reduction of the licking burst number, thus suggesting reduced motivation and/or increased satiation. Importantly, the experimental sessions were performed in an alternate order, either 1-h or 24-h after imipramine administration. The observation that imipramine effect was more pronounced in the “1-h after-treatment” sessions, i.e. at the time of the brain drug C max , led us to suggest that it was likely related to brain drug levels at testing time. However, such an experimental design does not allow to rule out the alternative possibility that the observed effect might be due to post-session administration, as previously observed with memantine. To determine whether imipramine-induced decrease of sucrose ingestion could be observed even in absence of post-session administration, we examined the effect of a daily 22 day treatment with imipramine (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg). In the first half of the treatment period all behavioural tests were performed 1-h after administration. In the second half of the treatment period, tests were performed alternatively either 1-h or 24-h after imipramine administration. The results confirm that imipramine reduces sucrose ingestion due to a reduction of the licking burst number. Most importantly, these results demonstrate that this effect does not require imipramine post-session administration, since it was present before the beginning of post-session administrations. This supports the interpretation of the reduction of sucrose ingestion as a consequence of reduced motivation and/or increased satiation. Thus, these findings, taken together with the results of our previous study, might be relevant in explaining the effects of imipramine in models of drug-seeking and in body weight gain reduction in rats, but not in accounting for the antidepressant therapeutic effect. At variance with the results of our previous study, an increase in burst size was present in the first half of the treatment period, which might be interpreted as a prohedonic effect and/or as a compensatory effect."
https://openalex.org/W3118842128,"Purpose The effect of statins on wound healing is controversial, and their effect on trabeculectomy outcomes remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the relationship between oral statin use and trabeculectomy outcomes. Methods Medical records of patients who underwent primary mitomycin-C augmented trabeculectomy with 2 years of follow-up were reviewed. Pre- and postoperative intraocular pressures (IOP) and numbers of medications, subconjunctival 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) injections, and bleb-needling procedures were compared between statin users and nonusers. Failure was defined as an eye that failed to achieve a 20% lowering of IOP from baseline or had an IOP &gt; 21 mm Hg, as well as an eye that required further surgical intervention, developed hypotony, or had no light perception visual acuity. Results In total, 158 subjects were enrolled, with 47 eyes from statin users and 111 eyes from statin nonusers. The 24-month cumulative probability of failure was 78.7% for statin users and 60.4% for nonusers ( P = .013). Cox proportional-hazards modeling showed a significantly higher hazard risk in statin users (adjusted hazard ratio 1.61, P = .026). There were no significant between-group differences in mean IOPs or number of medications (both P &gt; .05) at 24 months. Multivariable Poisson regression analysis that statin use was associated with increased numbers of 5-FU injections ( P = .014) and bleb-needling procedures ( P = .031). Conclusions This study demonstrated that oral statin use was associated with higher rates of trabeculectomy failure and increased numbers of 5-FU injections and bleb-needling procedures."
https://openalex.org/W3118884249,"Research suggests the relationship between time pressure and software quality to be more complex than presumed. While software developers can adjust their output to improve observed performance at the expense of software quality, the latter has been found to increase with time pressure in case of work-pace dependent incentives. An untested, but widely disseminated game-theoretical model seeks to resolve this contradiction and hypothesizes that high rates of time pressure avoid so-called ‘shortcuts’, which occur in the form of imperfections induced by developers to meet unrealistically tight deadlines. We conduct two laboratory experiments to empirically test this model for the first time. Our results corroborate the model with regard to its suggestion that shortcuts can be reduced if developers perceive unrealistic deadlines as ever-present. However, we also show that the actual critical probability of unrealistic deadlines–the point at which shortcut taking is drastically reduced–is above the theoretical one. Although final conclusions on the impact of time pressure on software quality remain to be drawn, our results suggest that–considering the contingencies of our study–time pressure helps in striving for quality in software projects."
https://openalex.org/W3119163765,"Maternal nutrition during gestation has been investigated for its role in child neurodevelopment. However, little is known about the potential impact of gestational caffeine exposure on child autistic behaviors. Here, we assess the relation between maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy and children’s behavioral traits related to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We harmonized data from two pregnancy cohorts, Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) (n = 120), an enriched-risk cohort of mothers who previously had a child with ASD, from Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Northern California (2009–2012), and the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study (n = 269), a general population cohort from Cincinnati, Ohio (2003–2006). Mothers self-reported caffeine intake twice during pregnancy. Caregivers reported child behavioral traits related to ASD using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) when children were aged 3–8 years. Higher scores indicate more ASD-related behaviors. We estimated covariate-adjusted differences in continuous SRS T-scores per interquartile range increase in caffeine intake. Self-reported caffeine intake during pregnancy was positively associated with SRS T-scores among children in EARLI (β: 2.0; 95% CI -0.1, 4.0), but to a lesser extent in HOME (β: 0.6; 95% CI -0.5, 1.6). In HOME, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) modified the association between caffeine intake and SRS T-scores, where more positive associations were observed among women with higher BMIs. Our findings suggest gestational caffeine intake may represent a marker of vulnerability to childhood ASD-related behaviors. Additional studies are warranted to extend these findings."
https://openalex.org/W3125540278,"Biomechanical deviations at individual joints are often identified by gait analysis of patients with cerebral palsy (CP). Analysis of the control of joint and leg stiffness of the locomotor system during gait in children with spastic diplegic CP has been used to reveal their control strategy, but the differences between before and after surgery remain unknown. The current study aimed to bridge the gap by comparing the leg stiffness—both skeletal and muscular components—and associated joint stiffness during gait in 12 healthy controls and 12 children with spastic diplegic CP before and after tendon release surgery (TRS). Each subject walked at a self-selected pace on a 10-meter walkway while their kinematic and forceplate data were measured to calculate the stiffness-related variables during loading response, mid-stance, terminal stance, and pre-swing. The CP group altered the stiffness of the lower limb joints and decreased the demand on the muscular components while maintaining an unaltered leg stiffness during stance phase after the TRS. The TRS surgery improved the joint and leg stiffness control during gait, although residual deficits and associated deviations still remained. It is suggested that the stiffness-related variables be included in future clinical gait analysis for a more complete assessment of gait in children with CP."
https://openalex.org/W3125663947,"Avian influenza viruses can cause economically devastating diseases in poultry and have the potential for zoonotic transmission. To mitigate the consequences of avian influenza, disease prediction systems have become increasingly important. In this study, we have proposed a framework for the prediction of the occurrence and spread of avian influenza events in a geographical area. The application of the proposed framework was examined in an Indonesian case study. An extensive list of historical data sources containing disease predictors and target variables was used to build spatiotemporal and transactional datasets. To combine disparate sources, data rows were scaled to a temporal scale of 1-week and a spatial scale of 1-degree × 1-degree cells. Given the constructed datasets, underlying patterns in the form of rules explaining the risk of occurrence and spread of avian influenza were discovered. The created rules were combined and ordered based on their importance and then stored in a knowledge base. The results suggested that the proposed framework could act as a tool to gain a broad understanding of the drivers of avian influenza epidemics and may facilitate the prediction of future disease events."

https://openalex.org/W3125703334,"Chronic kidney disease leads to high morbidity rates among humans. Kidney transplantation is often necessary for severe symptoms; however, options for new curative treatments are desired because of donor shortage. For example, it has been established that the kidneys can efficiently generate urine after transplantation of the metanephros, ureter, and bladder as a group. After transplantation, the urine can indirectly flow into the recipient’s bladder using a stepwise peristaltic ureter system method where the anastomosis is created via the recipient’s ureter for urinary tract reconstruction. However, the growth of the regenerated metanephros varies significantly, whereas the time window for successful completion of the stepwise peristaltic ureter system that does not cause hydronephrosis of the metanephros with bladder (ureter) is quite narrow. Therefore, this study was conducted to periodically and noninvasively evaluate the growth of the transplanted metanephros, ureter, and bladder in rats through computed tomography and ultrasonography. The ultrasonographic findings highly correlated to the computed tomography findings and clearly showed the metanephros and bladder. We found that the degree of growth of the metanephros and the bladder after transplantation differed in each case. Most of the rats were ready for urinary tract reconstruction within 21 days after transplantation. Optimizing the urinary tract reconstruction using ultrasonography allowed for interventions to reduce long-term tubular dilation of the metanephros due to inhibited overdilation of the fetal bladder, thereby decreasing the fibrosis caused possibly by transforming growth factor-β1. These results may be significantly related to the long-term maturation of the fetal metanephros and can provide new insights into the physiology of transplant regeneration of the metanephros in higher animals. Thus, this study contributes to the evidence base for the possibility of kidney regeneration in human clinical trials."
